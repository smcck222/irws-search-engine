FT  24 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Actuation side behind 23% growth at Rotork
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROTORK, the Bath-based valve control manufacturer, yesterday announced a 23
per cent increase to Pounds 9.5m in pre-tax profits for 1991, due to strong
sales to the water and oil industries.
The increase from last time's Pounds 7.7m came on turnover ahead slightly to
Pounds 51.5m (Pounds 50.8m).
Earnings increased to 20.66p (16.08p). A recommended final dividend of 5.75p
makes a total of 10p (9p).
Rotork Actuation, which accounts for the bulk of group profits, saw strong
demand from UK water companies, oil companies in the Americas and power
companies in Australasia.
European sales remained strong, while Singapore, Australia and South Korea
produced combined profits of Pounds 1m for the first time.
But the group warned that its smaller Rotork Instruments and Rotork Analysis
divisions were hit by the recession. Mr Tom Eassie, chief executive, said
export markets were being sought to reduce exposure to the UK.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Citicorp writes off Dollars 120m on Randsworth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CITICORP, the leading US bank, has written off Dollars 120m (Pounds 69m),
nearly one third of its loan exposure, to Randsworth Trust, the UK property
company placed in administrative receivership last week.
The decision to opt for receivership came after Citicorp failed to agree on
a financial reorganisation with JMB Realty, the Chicago property investment
firm that acquired Randsworth in 1989 on behalf of its pension fund clients.
Citicorp's exposure to Randsworth stems from a 1989 loan of Pounds 197m. But
investors holding a separate Dollars 229m of debentures have a more senior
claim as Randsworth creditors than Citicorp.
Following its write-off, Citicorp has about Dollars 215m of loan exposure to
Randsworth. The bank said yesterday it had 'recognised the erosion of value'
but stressed it remained sanguine about eventually recovering the
outstanding principal.
The Citicorp loan write-off represents a little more than 10 per cent of its
Dollars 1bn loan exposure in the London property market. Citicorp also has
about Dollars 300m of depressed property obtained after foreclosing on
London-booked loans in the UK and Australia. Last year Citicorp wrote off a
total of Dollars 304m of property loans in the UK and Australia. Mr John
Reed, chairman of Citicorp, last year took personal charge of the bank's
troubled worldwide property loan portfolio and moved to reclassify loans in
the US, UK and Australia. Most of Citicorp's problem property loans are in
the crippled US market, where about 41 per cent of the bank's Dollars 12bn
commercial property portfolio is classified as non-performing.
It remains unclear whether Citicorp will need to write off more of its
outstanding Dollars 215m of Randsworth loans. The bank is understood to be
discussing recovery prospects with KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants who
were last week named as court-appointed receivers of Randsworth.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Argos profits fall despite higher sales: Trading climate and
research costs cause catalogue-based retailer to drop 17%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARGOS, the catalogue showroom retailer, yesterday reported a 17 per cent
fall in annual profits in the face of 'the most dif-ficult retailing
environment since the company was launched in 1973'.
Pre-tax profits slipped from Pounds 75.1m to Pounds 62.1m as a result of the
difficult trading climate and the additional costs of researching and
launching a new furniture store concept.
Although sales this year had shown a small increase on the previous year,
Argos said it was difficult to predict future trading conditions because of
continuing political and economic uncertainty.
Mr Mike Smith, chief executive, said the company still had great scope for
geographical expansion and had identified 500 sites.
The company opened 18 stores in 1991 and ended the year with 285 outlets. It
is currently opening about 25 stores a year.
Argos is also testing the furniture market by launching four Chesterman
stores. Mr Smith said Argos had identified an opportunity to exploit the
upper end of the furniture market which was poorly served.
The first Chesterman store will open on Thursday in Mill Hill, London. Three
more will be opened this year in Chatham, Fareham and Bristol and, if
successful, the format will be extended.
Mr Smith said he could envisage the company opening 30 stores within five
years.
Mr Smith also revealed yesterday that Argos had researched the possibility
of launching a US-style 'warehouse club', which sells a narrow range of
goods at heavily discounted prices from large out-of-town stores.
He added that the different cost structures of retailing in the UK had
deterred it from opening such stores but he did not rule out the possibility
of eventually doing so.
In the year to December 28, sales rose from Pounds 905.57m to Pounds 926.65m
although operating profits slipped from Pounds 68.23m to Pounds 55.44m.
Interest income of Pounds 6.7m was Pounds 200,000 lower than the previous
year, reflecting the general fall in interest rates.
A final dividend of 4.3p will increase the annual payout by 7 per cent to
6.4p from 6p.
Earnings per share were helped by a lower rate of corporation tax but still
slipped from 16p to 13.9p.
Argos shares closed down 4p at 253p.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Pretoria moves to set up first multiracial councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PRETORIA, JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African government expects to have the first phase of a
multiracial interim government in place by next month, ministers said
yesterday.
Pretoria tabled proposals for multi-party transitional councils to oversee
key areas of government in the run-up to elections for an interim
legislature, expected to take place by mid-1993.
The African National Congress (ANC) initially rejected the proposals, saying
the councils would have insufficient powers and would be purely advisory.
However, ministers said council decisions would be binding on the cabinet.
Senior ANC officials said they believed agreement could be reached after
further negotiation within the Convention for a Democratic South Africa
(Codesa), the multi-party forum, including the Government, ANC and 17 other
parties, negotiating a post-apartheid constitution.
The ANC also rejected the government's insistence that the ANC abandon armed
struggle and disband its military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe, before full
transitional government is put in place. Pretoria took a hard line on this
issue, saying joint control of the police and army would only be conceded
once the question of armed struggle was resolved.
However, both sides said they believed a deal was within reach in this area
as well.
Under the government's proposals, the councils would include six members
chosen by Codesa, and a seventh appointed by the president in consultation
with Codesa.
The councils would initially oversee four areas of government: preparation
for elections, government finance, regional government and local government.
Councils to oversee education, health, housing and foreign relations would
be put in place as soon as agreement was reached by Codesa.
Once the government and the ANC resolved the question of the ANC's armed
struggle, the councils could then also oversee areas of security, including
the police and army.
The existing all-white cabinet would remain in place, although government
ministers made clear yesterday that, as the councils would take decisions by
consensus - and as consensus could not be achieved without the agreement of
all parties, including government - the cabinet would have no reason to veto
decisions already agreed by the government in the council.
Pretoria may have to make further concessions on the powers of the councils,
but it seems likely that the issue can be swiftly resolved in Codesa.
Further stumbling blocks could yet emerge, however, over who should be
appointed to the councils, and over how many parties should be represented.
The ANC wants the broadest possible representation, while the government
wants to exclude all but major parties.
Pretoria also proposed a second phase of interim government, involving an
elected two-house legislature, with the upper house made up either of
regional representatives, or of members of the existing white, Indian and
'coloured' houses of assembly.
There would also be a three-to-five man revolving presidency and an
appointed cabinet, though ministers made clear that much negotiation
remained on these issues.

FT  24 MAR 92 / German unions to face challenge on pay talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMAN INDUSTRY set the scene for future conflict with the trade union
movement yesterday by challenging the basis on which wage negotiations are
conducted.
Criticism of pay policy by the country's leading employers' association came
as Chancellor Helmut Kohl warned that the national economy was losing
momentum and appealed for moderation in wage demands.
At the same time the public sector union announced that pay talks for the
2.3m public sector workers had failed, setting the stage for arbitration
proceedings. If these prove unsuccessful, the sector could face its first
serious strike since 1974.
Mr Klaus Murmann, president of the country's leading employers' association,
the BDA, said a fundamental change in pay policy was needed. He was
protesting against the accelerating tendency towards national inflation-plus
awards which ignored regional and sectoral trends.
'Banks feel they can afford a 5 per cent increase this year,' he said. But
there was no way the engineering industry could match this. Economic
prospects had been 'seriously endangered' by misguided pay policies.
He said overall labour costs had to be reduced in the interests of
stability, competitiveness and recovery in the former GDR. The only way was
through a fundamental change in pay policy.
'We employers are not just talking about change, we have decided to
introduce it. A course correction is inevitable and anyone who postpones it
will suffer,' Mr Murmann added. Talks would start with government and unions
as soon as the current pay round was finished.
The employers' association insisted that productivity had to be the sole
criterion governing wage increases this year.
The DGB union confederation promptly rejected Mr Murmann's demands. It said
it had seen no evidence of pressure for change among employers in around 20
recent pay settlements of up to 7 per cent in small industries.
Mr Kohl said that, with economic growth of 1.5 per cent expected in the west
this year, the room for manoeuvre over pay had shrunk. Employers and unions
had to bring wages closer into line with productivity.
While efficiency in the east was only 29 per cent of western levels, he
said, average pay was 44 per cent of that in the former federal republic.
Mr Kohl's intervention underscored the deepening gloom over the prospects
for the east, which depend on massive transfers of public money and
investment from the private sector. Foreign investment so far accounts for
only about 10 per cent of the total spent there since unification.
The declarations from the BDA, which had withdrawn from the public debate
over pay as sectoral negotiations for banking, public service and
engineering workers got under way in the past few weeks, highlight an
underlying debate and growing anxiety within German industry.
Medium-sized companies, which account for two-thirds of the national
workforce, are increasingly resentful of over-generous settlements on pay,
holidays and working hours agreed between unions and employers' groups
dominated by large, rich companies such as Daimler-Benz.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Letter: Homework that assures success in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GAVIN CLEZY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The Gieves Group, when announcing a substantial loss last year, put a
large measure of the blame on the higher than expected losses suffered by
its new store in Milan.
Opened only a year ago, the new shop has no doubt had the misfortune to
experience at the outset the economic difficulties common to the sector in
general, but one has to ask the question if its plight is not symptomatic of
a far deeper malaise which seems to have struck British comp anies entering
Italy, more than most.
I have the strong impression that normally sensible British businessmen
suffer a temporary loss of their critical faculties when it comes to
negotiating with Italians in Italy.
No-one doubts the seriousness of the vast majority of Italian businessmen,
but neither should anyone under estimate their charm, especially when it is
reinforced by the background 'magic of Italy'.
There is a long, sad list of serious miscalculations by British investors in
Italy. Many of these might have been avoided if the companies concerned had
only done their basic research properly and gone to the trouble of talking
to people on the spot, who between them have a wealth of experience and a
ready will-ingness to give objective advice.
Until British companies interested in expanding their presence in this
vitally important but complex market do their homework properly, those of us
living and working in Italy can only hold our breath in horror as,
lemming-like, one company after another blindly goes over the brink.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Letter: Pro and con the shadow budget
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID GRENIER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Lex identifies a gaping hole in the Labour party's shadow budget
('Labour turns on the charm', March 17), but even Lex may have
underestimated its size.
Mr John Smith has indicated that he would work within the Pounds 28bn public
sector borrowing requirement (PSBR) target set by the chancellor for fiscal
1992-93. That target depends heavily on continuing receipts of Pounds 8bn
from privatisations. But the issue is not simply one of tracking down the
difference between this figure and the Pounds 6bn of identifiable
privatisation receipts; it is one of judging the market's willingness to
finance any further privatisations under a Labour government and therefore
of judging on what terms such issues might take place.
It is no coincidence that it has taken a general election campaign to
concentrate the minds of messrs Kinnock and Smith on the virtues of
accepting ongoing privatisation. Other members of the shadow cabinet,
however, do not appear to have synchronised their conversion to the new
doctrine. Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, still appears to
believe that the water companies will come back into public ownership under
a Labour government. Mr Frank Dobson, shadow energy secretary, believes
Labour would take control of the power generators. And Mr John Prescott,
shadow transport secretary, is threatening to reverse the recent buy-outs of
port authorities.
This is yet another example of Labour, under electoral pressure, being
prepared to play fast and loose - in this case with the savings of millions
of investors.

Sir, Labour's tax proposals provoke a curious response from some of your
readers. (Letters March 21 and 22).
Mr Peter Brown and his Top Pay Research Group obviously do not believe in
the market. Why should employers grant extra pay increases to those earning
between Pounds 20,000 and Pounds 30,000 a year to compensate for the
increased tax in Mr John Smith's shadow budget when Mr Brown says there are
a record number of qualified staff on the dole? We won't.
Mr Tyler forecasts that Mr Smith's budget will cause a collapse in those
services consumed by above average earners. I shall just save less, and if
instead the money is spent on consumption by the less well-off it will
probably help my business.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, Antony Thorncroft accurately reports our intention to commission an
independent review of our costs, ('Opera House asks consultant to
investigate costs', March 20) but unnecessarily, and inaccurately, adds that
'many recent new productions have attracted tepid reviews'. Does he read the
Financial Times? Huguenots was hardly tepidly received. It was excoriated.
But the reviews of our last four successive new opera productions - Simon
Boccanegra, Mitridate Re di Ponto, Don Giovanni, Death in Venice - were
glowing in their approval, and Clement Crisp, reviewing the Royal Ballet
recently, in new work and old, has much admired and praised what he has
seen.
For the second year running, the Royal Opera House has achieved the double
whammy of winning both the Standard awards for opera and ballet. Of this
year's six Olivier nominations for opera, four come to us. Our ballet
companies won three out of six. Casually to compare our work unfavourably
with English National Opera's is to play an old cracked vinyl record, long
out of date. And it hurts. It is hard enough to justify a necessary level of
funding without having to contend with under-representation of what we
actually achieve.

'The FBI have dropped all charges relating to the Dollars 4bn.'

Sir Evelyn Rothschild's flirtation with the idea that an outsider could run
his family's bank, NM Rothschild, has run its course. Fred Vinton, the chief
operating officer, is departing to look after another family fortune - that
of the Argentine Bembergs.
The proprietorial Sir Evelyn plucked the outsider Vinton from JP Morgan at
the end of 1987 in a move so unusual that some Rothschild directors assumed
Vinton was Sir Evelyn's heir apparent.
But last month Sir Evelyn appointed his cousin, Baron David de Rothschild,
as deputy chairman. Sir Evelyn has made it clear that Baron de Rothschild,
senior partner of Rothschild et Cie in Paris, is likely to succeed him.
Although Sir Evelyn has two sons, they are still at school and considered
just a trifle too young to take over just yet, though their eventual
succession is taken for granted.
Sir Evelyn's hope is that cousin David will help to knit together the
various Rothschild banks worldwide - just as Michel David-Weill has forged
strong links between the assorted Lazard banks.
Vinton himself, an American, is returning to his roots without the upheaval
of leaving the UK. He was born in the Argentine and worked there for JP
Morgan. However, he will manage the Bemberg private businesses from London
and will still be able to indulge his passion for foxhunting.

Ever since he announced he was stepping down as chairman of British Nuclear

big job. One that might have done was the CBI director-generalship, but he
apparently turned it down.
Undoubtedly, he should make a good replacement for Nicholas Wills, the
deposed boss of the not-so-recession proof BET. Even so is BET big enough
for an ambitious executive like Harding?
On the other hand, it could be that Harding - one of only a handful of Lord
Hanson's lieutenants to prove themselves outside Hanson - is using BET as a
training ground while awaiting the call to succeed the 70-year-old Lord.
After all at 52, Harding can afford to wait.

Of the two new ventures in the life of George Davies, the birth of his son
is the more original. As the ex-boss of Next previously had five daughters
from his two marriages, a first son (another George, of course) is a brand
new development, which is more than can be said for his latest retailing
venture.
His 'magalogue' - a hybrid magazine and catalogue - is called Xtend, a title
somewhat reminiscent of the Department X store he developed while at Next.
Xtend will include a gardening section and - as students of Davies's career
may recall - his last, doomed venture at Next was the development of a
gardening catalogue, which delivered plants but sadly not profits.
However some onlookers are taking heart from the fact that Davies's
estranged wife Liz, who was product director at Next, is not involved in the
latest move. Some suspect it was her undue influence over her husband that
precipitated the boardroom bust-up culminating in George's exit in December
1988.

A Flood would probably strike most people as the last thing likely to be
helpful to a troubled property development called Canary Wharf. If so, most
people would be wrong.
For A Flood - Al to his friends - is the name of the president of the
corporate- banking division of Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, and few
folk will be more involved in the restructuring of Canary Wharf's developers
Olympia &amp; York.
Besides being one of the O&amp;Y's two main bankers (the other is Citicorp),
Canadian Imperial is among the biggest lenders to the beleaguered London
docklands property.
Those dealing with Flood will find that he doesn't suffer fools gladly. They
may also discover that he has other things than O&amp;Y on his mind.
Canadian Imperial will soon announce a new chief executive to succeed Donald
Fullerton, who is retiring. Flood, aged 56 and with 30 years service, is the
front-runner. His main rival is the investment-banking head Paul Cantor.
More outgoing and less formal than Flood, Cantor is seen by many onlookers
as a potentially stronger leader for Canada's second-biggest financial
institution.

Sir, What a tragedy for London if County Hall is sold for conversion to a
hotel and leisure centre rather than used to rehouse the London School of
Economics. And what an uninspiring desperate vision of London Michael
Heseltine, the environment minister, and Godfrey Taylor, chairman of the
London Residuary Body, seem to have to allow the proposed sale to proceed.
If London is to hold its own in Europe it needs to strengthen and revive its
education facilities. Every Londoner would benefit from the enhanced stature
and improved facilities of the LSE relocating to County Hall.
It is a unique opportunity for the school to establish itself as the leading
European school of social and political science. It will be a contribution
to a city straining under the pressure of tourists. On planning grounds
alone, hotel and leisure use with attendant coaches should not be permitted.
Is this an attempt by Taylor and Heseltine to burn the oil wells? And how
does this square with Heseltine's pronouncements that the use of Somerset
House should be non- commercial?

FT  24 MAR 92 / Leading Article: County Hall
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE investment has been one of the most positive forces in the UK
economy for two decades. It has probably saved the British car industry.
That said, the government's decision to permit the sale of County Hall to
the Shirayama Corporation, for use as a hotel and leisure centre, is deeply
to be regretted.
County Hall, former home of the Greater London Council, is not London's
finest building, although it stands on a magnificent site opposite
parliament. The London School of Economics would like to move there from
cramped premises on the other side of the river.
Such a move would express confidence in a British institution of world
renown. It would also secure the building for a prime civic purpose at the
end of a construction boom which has erected some fine towers and atriums to
Mammon, but few to Academe.
For the government to let the building become a hotel for the sake of a few
million pounds difference in the bids reveals a blind spot one would not
have thought typical of Mr Major's public spirited style of Conservatism. If
it wins, Labour says it will reverse the decision. It would be right do so.
Better still, Mr Major should think again.

FT  24 MAR 92 / A patient on the road to recovery: The US banking industry
has taken drastic restructuring measures, but it is still ailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The battered US banking sector, having suffered over the past 18 months from
crisis levels of commercial property loan losses and bad debts, is poised to
remake itself.
Like much of corporate America, the big banks are trying to restructure
their way out of recession. Their tools are heavy bad debt provisioning,
savage cuts in spending, the disposal of non-strategic assets to raise the
cash needed to bolster capital ratios and, increasingly, the use of mergers
to eliminate excess capacity and slash back-office and other administrative
costs.
The medicine is being taken, but the patient cannot yet be pronounced fully
recovered. It would be more accurate to say that the cure will take a long
time, and could still result in complications. The most notable risk for
some institutions is the still-depressed US commercial real estate market.
Mr Art Ryan, president of Chase Manhattan, one of the New York banks that
took early steps to address the real estate crisis, says last year was
'something of a catharsis for us'. He sees little or no growth in profits
for the first six months of 1992, and admits he is not even sure there will
be a recovery in the second half of the year.
But Mr Ryan, along with many other bankers, stresses that the steps being
taken should lead to a leaner and meaner US banking sector: 'Reports of the
demise of US banking are greatly exaggerated.'
As a sign of recovery, bankers point to the way in which they have
strengthened a vital ratio: the proportion of their assets accounted for by
common equity or its equivalent. Under the Basle agreement between central
banks, this so-called Tier 1 capital adequacy ratio must be more than 4 per
cent for all banks by the end of this year.
At one stage, it looked as if some big US banks would have trouble reaching
this level. The obvious way of strengthening capital - issuing more shares -
was closed to them by the downgrading of many banks' credit ratings and
investor concerns about property loans.
There was only one, painful, solution: under pressure from federal
regulators, dividends at many banks have been slashed or even eliminated.
This, together with asset sales and cost cuts has helped to strengthen
capital levels.
For the leading 10 US banks, the average Tier 1 capital ratio is now nearly
a percentage point above the 4 per cent level. A notable exception is
Citicorp, America's biggest bank, which has a common equity-to-assets ratio
below 4 per cent.
In the view of Mr Tom Hanley, a senior banking analyst at First Boston
investment bank in New York, the industry is 'just now going through the
first wave of restructuring that will eventually bring it back to restored
health'.
But other observers are less sanguine. Mr Mark Gross, head of the New York
office of IBCA, the UK bank credit rating agency, says: 'The US banking
industry is still bumping along at the bottom in terms of profitability and
problem assets.'
Mr Gross cites IBCA's own analysis of the leading 44 US banks, which shows
that total non-performing loans plus the depressed property held by banks
after they foreclosed on loans jumped from Dollars 23.3bn in 1986 to Dollars
57.8bn in 1991. Total bad debt reserves covered 64 per cent of these problem
loans and property holdings in 1986 (Dollars 14.9bn) while last year - in
the middle of the crisis - they covered less than 58 per cent (Dollars
33.4bn). This illustrates that more provisions still need to be made.
The main reason why it is too early to predict a rapid recovery is the
persistent - and pervasive - nature of the commercial property crisis.
Overbuilding in many big US cities during the late 1980s was supported by a
lemming-like rush into property lending by many banks. When the banking
slump finally arrived - on the heels of the crash of many savings and loans
institutions - many bankers discovered they had badly misjudged the market
and had loan portfolios too concentrated on property.
According to Mr Sandon Goldberg, a property analyst at Salomon Brothers, US
commercial real estate values have dropped by an average 30 per cent over
the past three years. Many senior bankers and property developers say they
do not expect much of a recovery in prices for the next two or three years.
Mr Alan Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, recently said he
expects commercial real estate values to continue to drop across the US, a
pattern that could bode ill for many banks. 'We have got no evidence that
suggests commercial values are stabilising and even remotely showing signs
of turning up,' he said. Top executives at Citicorp, Chemical Banking and
Chase Manhattan support this view. They say they expect their 1992 bad debt
provisions to be at about the same levels as last year, largely because of
the depressed property market.
Mr John McGillicuddy, the former head of Manufacturers Hanover Trust who was
named chairman of Chemical Banking after the merger between the two banks,
says the banking industry will eventually claw back profitability. But he
warns: 'We still have a significant pile of problems to deal with as we
march through 1992, of which real estate is number one.'
The challenge is more acute in certain regions. Perhaps the most seriously
affected area is New England, where unemployment has leapt above the
national average, and overbuilding in the 1980s was among the most severe in
the US.
Mr Richard Syron, president of the Federal Reserve of Boston and a member of
Mr Greenspan's board of governors, says real estate in New England 'is close
to bottoming', but it could be five years before the market returns to
health.
While banks in the north-east expect more heavy bad debt provisions,
Midwestern banks, especially in states such as Ohio and Illinois, are more
fortunate than either east or west coast institutions because the local
property markets have held up better.
Mr Robert Parry, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco,
says the west coast economy is either 'at the bottom or still
deteriorating'. He notes this could affect banks throughout the region.
Real estate, of course, is not the only factor affecting the industry.
Another has been the harsh criticism over the so-called 'credit crunch', in
which bankers are reported to have been unwilling to lend during the
recession. This trend is now abating. But the other side of the coin is that
US consumer confidence, although showing glimmers of improvement, remains
weak, and as many companies seek to reduce debts and dispose of assets, loan
demand is flat.
One partial remedy for the banking system - much-needed legislative reform -
looks unlikely in the near future. While most bankers want the right to open
interstate branches and to expand into equity underwriting, insurance and
other financial service areas prohibited under US laws, no one believes such
reform stands much chance of passage in this presidential election year. Mr
Syron calls the legislation 'essential, but dead for the time being'.
There is some good news - such as recently reduced reserve requirements that
will help strengthen bank capital ratios, and the lowering by the Federal
Reserve last December of interest rates. This should lead to better net
profit margins across the country because banks have been slow to lower the
cost of borrowing to many customers. There are also hints that federal bank
examiners may be slightly less tough on banks in coming months.
Regulators were criticised last year for forcing too-severe bad debt
provisions and write-offs at several banks, but Mr William Taylor, the
chairman of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC), the bank
regulatory agency that handles bank failures, says the agency is simply
'working through the problems'.
One way to measure the health of the US banking industry is to examine the
state of the fund - used for rescues - operated by the FDIC. At the end of
1989 the FDIC had Dollars 13bn in its fund; by the end of 1990 the fund was
down to Dollars 4bn. At present, as Mr Taylor puts it, 'we're broke'. He
estimates that a new Dollars 30bn line of credit extended to the FDIC by the
US Treasury will just about cover expected bank failures between now and the
end of 1993.
A more realistic method of fixing what ails the industry could be more
mergers to reduce administrative costs. The most promising is the recent
joining of New York's Manufacturers Hanover Trust with Chemical Banking, a
move supposed to save Dollars 750m of annual costs within four years.
Regulators such as Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, have
predicted that by the end of this decade the number of US banks will be
significantly lower as a result of consolidation in the industry. The trauma
of the past 18 months has already led to three of the biggest mergers in US
history - last year also saw the combination of Bank of America and Security
Pacific in California and the joining of C&amp;S/Sovran and NCNB in the
south-east.
Although Citicorp remains the biggest US bank in asset terms, with Bank of
America-Security Pacific just behind, the very map of America's top 10 banks
is likely to change in coming years, with new names such as NationsBank, the
name chosen for NCNB and C&amp;S/Sovran, moving up the league table.
There will certainly be more mergers, but they are not a panacea: their
relative success is linked to specific factors such as potential cost
savings and the shape of regional markets.
Looking ahead, it is likely that US banking will only finally turn the
corner when the broader economy improves significantly. When asked to
forecast prospects for US banking, Mr Taylor says he sees a light at the end
of the tunnel. But he warns: 'I want to make sure it isn't a train coming at
me.'

FT  24 MAR 92 / Personal View: Hard on soft commissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By D BRUCE JOHNSEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Momentum is slowly building on both sides of the Atlantic to restrict the
freedom of money managers to accept a novel kind of brokerage rebate called
'soft commissions'. The proposed restrictions are based on the mistaken
belief that those who invest in unit trusts, pension funds and other
institutional portfolios need even more regulatory protection than they
already have. What investors may really need is protection from regulators.
The suspicious thing about soft commissions is that they 'bundle' the costs
of portfolio research into cash-trading commissions. In a typical soft
commission deal, a broker pre-pays research expenses on behalf of a money
manager in proportion to the future trading commissions the manager promises
the broker. The manager receives research up front and, if all goes as
planned, pays for it later by providing the broker with the promised trades.
Soft commission business perhaps amounts to Pounds lbn annually in the US
and Britain.
The widely held view of soft commissions is that they compromise a manager's
loyalty to his clients because cash-trading commissions are paid indirectly
by clients. Accordingly, soft commissions are said to tempt a manager to
engage in excessive trading to generate the commissions necessary to pay the
research bill he should properly pay out of his own pocket. They are also
said to reduce his willingness to terminate a broker who has failed to
execute trades at the best price.
An alternative explanation for soft commissions is that they actually
benefit investors by subsidising portfolio research, guaranteeing quality of
trading execution, and promoting specialisation. To see this, it is first
important to separate two issues. First, why are research and execution
bundled together at all? Second, why use such a novel arrangement as soft
commissions to account for bundled research?
Virtually all brokers bundle research and execution. This is true of soft
commission brokers, but it is also true of traditional, full-service brokers
who produce the research 'in house' and make it available to managers on an
informal basis. Most managers are paid just a small fraction of any increase
in wealth they generate on their clients' behalf. If they were required to
pay the entire research bill out of their own pockets, they would apparently
have too little incentive to do well-researched trades. A manager's clients
therefore have good reason to subsidise his use of research. Bundling
provides the ideal subsidy.
In part, profitable trading requires a manager to ensure that the brokers
who trade on his clients' behalf execute the trade at the best possible
price. But quality of execution is nearly impossible to discern in the short
run. How is a manager to prevent an inept, indolent or opportunistic broker
doing a shoddy job of execution? Again, bundling does the trick. Having
received research up front at the broker's expense, the balance of trading
commissions a manager owes the broker serves to bond the broker's
performance. Any broker that cheats the manager risks the prospect of being
terminated with his account balance unpaid. Far from compromising best
execution, bundling actually guarantees it.
Why use soft commissions explicitly to account for bundled research? Under
the traditional system, the broker's research obligations are only loosely
tied to the cash trading commissions he expects from the manager. One
consequence is that the broker's research obligations are too indefinite to
be transferred; the research must be produced by the broker 'in house'.
With soft commissions, the broker's research obligations are explicitly tied
to the cash value of the trading commissions he expects. By precisely
metering these obligations, soft commissions assure that they are definite
enough to be transferred to those who can perform them at least cost. Seen
in this light, soft commissions constitute a kind of currency that achieves
the benefits of bundling while allowing research and execution to be
efficiently produced by specialised firms.
Regulators on both sides of the Atlantic are currently entertaining
suggestions that soft commissions, but not traditional brokerage, be subject
to disclosure requirements. Even when applied uniformly to all commission
business, such burdens are probably ill-advised. When applied selectively to
soft commissions, they are not just ill-advised but downright disingenuous.
The call for regulation should give us pause. It would be comforting to live
in a world where money managers' interests were perfectly aligned with those
of their clients and where the quality of a broker's execution could be
instantly discerned. But that is not the world in which we live, and further
regulation to protect investors based on such an ideal world will only make
matters worse.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Leading Article: France fragmented
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS EXPECTED, French voters took the opportunity provided by local and
regional elections on Sunday to deliver a stinging rebuke to their
little-loved Socialist government, without giving anything like a massive
vote of confidence to the conservative opposition. The Socialist party's
share of the vote (which was 36.4 per cent in the 1988 general election)
fell to an ignominious 18.3, but the conservatives' also fell, if less
drastically, from 37.7 to 33.0.
This was clearly a protest vote not just against the government but against
the whole political establishment; and it seems to have been directed more
against the style and morality of politics than against the substance of
policy. Asked what had counted most in inciting them to vote as they did, 41
per cent of those polled referred to 'les affaires' - the spate of recent
political scandals. Only 24 per cent cited unemployment - although this is
at a near-record level, affecting 9.8 per cent of the workforce - and 15 per
cent immigration, the theme which has given the racist National Front (FN)
its popularity.
FN's advance
The FN itself won 13.9 per cent of the vote, which comes almost as a relief
after its own and others' predictions that it might reach 20 per cent and/or
overtake the Socialists. The uncomfortable fact is, however, that the latter
did happen in several regions, including those centred on Paris and Lyon.
The FN is not strong enough to win executive power for itself in any region,
but in many it will hold the balance, forcing the conservative parties to
make an awkward choice between seeking its support, renouncing power, or
reaching some kind of accommodation with their Socialist opponents.
As Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, was quick to point out, this
fragmented picture - with many seats in regional assemblies also going to
two rival ecology parties, and not a few to purely local groups - is a
product of proportional representation, which President Francois Mitterrand
has hinted he would like to reintroduce also for next year's parliamentary
election
Mitterrand's prestige
But only a rigorously proportional system would, on Sunday's figures, be
enough to deny the conservatives an overall majority in the next parliament,
and such a system would also give the FN 77 parliamentary seats where at
present it has only one. It is hard to believe the president would take on
himself the responsibility of producing such a result simply to avoid a
repetition of his experience of 'cohabiting' with a conservative government
If a governing party in Britain suffered a defeat of this magnitude one year
before a general election, it might well consider changing its leader. But
the real leader of France's Socialists is Mr Mitterrand himself. Even if he
decides, as many are urging him, to correct the mistake he made in
appointing the unfortunate Mrs Edith Cresson as prime minister last year,
there is little reason to suppose he can revive his own prestige in the eyes
of the voters. The best service he could render to his party now would be to
resign before the parliamentary elections in March 1993. It would be in the
interests of a Socialist presidential candidate - whether Mr Michel Rocard
or, more probably, Mr Jacques Delors - to have the presidential election
first, if the right persists in restricting its own choice of candidates to
Mr Chirac and Mr Valery Giscard d'Estaing, both quintessentially
'yesterday's men'. That, perhaps, was the message the voters were sending on
Sunday when they cast their protest votes for parties other than the
official opposition.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Leaden rules
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG and deep recessions can wreak havoc on the accounts of the most prudent
institutions; the government is no exception. An unexpectedly severe fall in
UK tax revenues will push public sector borrowing above Pounds 28bn in the
coming financial year, whoever wins the election. But the government
accounts are financially sound as yet. There is no reason for a shareholder
revolt.
Yet the air is thick with accusations of profligacy and declarations of
prudence. Labour says the Conservatives are borrowing for tax cuts, while it
would borrow to build; the Conservatives say Labour is looking for an excuse
for excessive public spending; some commentators say the public finances are
fast running out of control.
It is the economy, not the government's finances, that is currently in a
sorry state. The UK has suffered the deepest recession of any European
country; but it also has one of the lowest outstanding stocks of government
debt as a percentage of gross domestic product.
Moreover, both parties are committed to seemingly prudent restrictions on
public borrowing. The present government intends to balance the budget over
the economic cycle, implying a falling ratio of debt to GDP. A Labour
government will 'only borrow for investment' and keep to the Maastricht
treaty deficit and debt ceilings of 3 per cent and 60 per cent of GDP
respectively.
'Golden rule'
Whether their manifestos are promising more than the parties can deliver, in
tax cuts or spending, will only be apparent once the recovery is under way.
There is no economic case for tax increases this year or next, contrary to
the claims made in yesterday's Guardian. It argued that the so-called
'golden rule' that public borrowing should not exceed investment will be
violated next year for the first time since records began in the early
1960s.
If this really were Labour's golden rule, it would make no sense. There is
no reason why the government should not borrow for current spending when tax
revenues are temporarily depressed. No sensible government would, or should,
require the Treasury to cut current spending or raise taxes to cut borrowing
this year, in order to satisfy an arbitrary accounting rule. Nor has the UK
government ever pursued such a rule. The general government balance, minus
the healthy surplus of public corporations, was in deficit for most of the
1980s. The government's privatisation programme has merely shifted the
income from their investment to the private sector in return for a reduction
in public debt.
Public investment
Labour's version of the golden rule must, instead, apply on average over the
economic cycle. Even then it would make little sense on the standard
definition of public investment. The principal justification for financing
investment through borrowing is that such spending generates more tax
revenue in the future. Yet much so-called investment in buildings and roads
generates no return, unlike some of the supposedly current spending on
education and health.
Both parties' alternative rules make some economic sense; neither has any
compelling logic behind it; and both are open to abuse. How long is the
economic cycle? What is public investment? Neither question is answered in
the manifestos. What really matters is that a sluggish recovery will
constrain either party in government. Growth much below 3 per cent a year
would rule out Conservative tax cuts; while most of Labour's spending
promises would also remain unfulfilled.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Arts: The Brahms Experience - Weekend music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEEN ELIZABETH HALL Sponsored by National Westminster Bank
The choice of Brahms as the focus for this latest of Roger Norrington's
'Experience' weekends worked out surprisingly well. The composer himself was
well aware of his own musical sources, and so there was plenty of background
material on which the intellect could feed, while the aural experience of
hearing his music on period instruments is still new enough to seem a
novelty.
The two-day programme followed the customary pattern. Under Norrington's
watchful eye a mixture of lectures and short recitals alternated,
culminating on Sunday night in a performance of Brahms's German Requiem; the
atmosphere was pleasantly relaxed rather than didactic.
All the musical events were given on instruments of Brahms's own time. Some
work has of course already been done in this area, notably by Roger
Norrington himself, who has made a start on the symphonies; but there is
still much to learn, notably when it comes to hearing the chamber music in a
new light.
The first afternoon brought contrasting successes and failures in this
respect. The short programme of songs by Olaf Bar and John Toll brought a
pleasingly light touch to what can all too easily seem lugubrious music,
Bar's graceful and somewhat carefully produced baritone being well
complemented by the clear tones of the fortepiano. But the reverse side of
period instruments then showed itself, when the following chamber recital
for strings brought an uncomfortable display of scratchy tone and poor
intonation.
That, presumably, is all part of the 'experience'. Most interesting of all
was the Saturday evening programme, in which a potted history of Brahms's
interest in earlier choral music was linked to the forthcoming performance
of his Requiem. That the composer was an admirer of Schutz and Bach is well
known. To hear a Benedictus by Gabrieli, however, performed according to the
expressive markings with which Brahms annotated his own score, is another
matter entirely and one pregnant with possibilities for the future.
It was the Schutz Choir of London which had worked with Norrington to
perfect all the smallest dynamic shadings and emphases there, and the same
singers, though increased in number, who joined the London Classical Players
for the main evening concert on Sunday. Lynne Dawson was the bright soprano
and Bar returned as a most expressive baritone to complete the forces for
the German Requiem.
As befits a week-end course of this kind, it was a performance in which all
the strands of scholarship were brought together. For this was music-making
of considerable intensity and learning, every phrase thought about and
consciously shaped in much the way that the Gabrieli under Brahms's own
instructions had been the evening before. The recording that will ensue
should repay long study: the tangible product from an enterprise of which
one hopes we have not heard the last.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Arts: A new 'Hoffmann' from the Boston Lyric Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Boston is where Sarah Caldwell presented Norma with Wagner's added aria, and
Don Carlos with the passages that Verdi cut. (Also the American premieres of
Montezuma, Intolleranza, The Ice Break, Taverner, Die Soldaten, etc.) Her
grand Opera House, alas, is boarded up at the moment, her Opera Company of
Boston in the red. But a younger company, the Boston Lyric Opera, keeps
going, and maintains proper Bostonian tradition by presenting a new,
fuller-than-ever-before version of The Tales of Hoffmann.
Hoffmann has a textual history even more tangled than that of Carmen, Don
Carlos, or Candide. In brief: Offenbach died while work was in progress;
Carvalho gave the premiere (1881) without the Giulietta act; for Vienna,
Guiraud wrote recitatives to replace Offenbach's mixture of recitative,
melodrama (words spoken over music), and spoken dialogue. In Monte Carlo
(1904), Gunsbourg and the composer Andre Bloch created a new Giulietta act,
adding 'Scintille, diamant' and the Sextet, based on Offenbach melodies. And
this became the standard version until Arthur Hammond, Felsenstein, Colin
Graham, Bonynge and others sought to tidy and tighten the work, using the
scanty sources then available.
In 1976, 1250 autograph pages turned up in the Offenbach estate; Fritz Oeser
used them for his edition, but added fresh corruptions of his own. Another
350 pages turned up at Sotheby's in 1984; they were used for Michael Kaye's
edition, which had a partial premiere (with Domingo) in Los Angeles in 1988
and has been recorded by Philips. Further work, and the discovery of the
1881 libretto submitted to the censors, enabled Kaye to refine and amplify
the edition, which had its premiere in Boston this month.
Does it matter? Musically, Hoffmann, Offenbach's only shot at a serious
opera, cannot (despite some pretty numbers) hold a candle to La Belle Helene
or Orphee aux enfers. Its dramaturgy - discrete Hoffmann tales gathered into
a frame of the Poet, his Various Loves, his Evil Genius, and his
Muse-Companion - resists serious, consistent handling. Is Lindorf the
villain? His music is sinister; he shatters Olympia, drives Antonia to
death, steals souls and gets people killed in Venice. Or is he the Muse's
accomplice, freeing the Poet from distracting entanglements? Is he a dark
side of Hoffmann himself - an earlier Mittenhofer - who sacrifices people so
that he can turn their suffering into art? Is the fourfold heroine -
heartless beautiful doll, self-centred artist, passionate courtesan, great
prima donna singing Donna Anna - Offenbach's compound portrait of Woman?
Needless questions] Hoffmann works best as a tuneful divertissement with a
teasing hint of earnestness, no more, at its core. Many people evidently do
care about it; new productions keep turning up. There can be no 'definitive'
version; Kaye's edition has alternative finales for Venice - one sung, the
other spoken over music, and both by Offenbach - and alternative apotheoses.
But directors can now make their choices from all the music that Offenbach
left, not simply from what Guiraud made of it, and Bloch added to it, and
Oeser (freely reorchestrating, transposing, adding) contrived.
The revelation of the Boston performance was the easy, natural flow between
speech, melodrama (speech over music), recitative unmeasured, measured
recitative, and song. There was music unheard before: a new version of the
Muse's first romance; a Giulietta chanson running up to high D; song for
Stella and the Muse in the finale; in the apotheosis, a touching farewell
from Stella-Olympia-Antonia-Giulietta, yielding Hoffmann to his destiny but
reminding him that memories of her will play a part in it. The
orchestration, thanks to the newly found pages, is now Offenbach's own. The
Venice act was almost wholly new and made some sort of sense for the first
time.
It was a long evening. One felt that Offenbach would surely have cut. It
would have seemed less long had the singers been lighter, more charming of
timbre, verbally acute, less loud. John Fowler, the Hoffmann, headed for
high notes, which rang out freely, but sang much else in a reinforced snarl.
Patricia Racette, the heroine, was an entertaining, captivating Olympia, and
a moving Antonia when she sang softly; but often she sang loudly and lost
any limpidness. Stephen West, as the multiple villain, roared out on
approximate pitches - a sad decline from his promising Sachs in Seattle a
few years ago. All three should work for a while with Les Arts Florissants
and discover that pure, forward declamation and unforced tone mean more than
pumped-up volume.
Stephen Lord, the Lyric's music director, conducted. He kept things going
but pushed through some phrases that needed time to breathe. James
Robinson's production included some silly ideas - the male choristers at
Spalanzani's party were all bespectacled Hoffmanns, the women all dolls -
but was generally acceptable. So was Richard Isackes set.
About Caldwell shows one never used so tame a word as 'acceptable'. Whether
of old or new operas, they were arresting. She may have been improvident,
impractical, reckless; the musical execution was sometimes hit-or-miss; but
she made Boston a fiery centre of American opera. May she soon be active
again: without her (and without the Peter Sellars rival company once
announced) there is less reason to visit Boston - except when something like
this Hoffmann turns up. And even while hearing it, one thought what Caldwell
and her company (who produced the Felsenstein version in the 1960s) might
make of it.

<TEXT>
Why do audiences so stubbornly resist the BBC Symphony Orchestra's winter
concerts? The new policy of giving concerts in Barbican Hall has not, alas,
improved matters. Friday night's concert under the orchestra's chief
conductor Andrew Davis was more like a studio session.
It was, of course, a recording session as well - all BBC Symphony concerts
are - and Radio 3 listeners will presently be able to seize the opportunity,
even if the London public did not, of comparing two important British works
of 1948, both well-known but not too often given of late. Admittedly there
is something about Vaughan Williams's sixth symphony that all too vividly
recalls the recording studio, the film sound-track, the wartime Pathe News.
But it is full of interesting features. The subtle eliding of four movements
into a continuous structure is one - an old trick, but freshly appealing
here; another is the complex but sharp-kicking metrics; and a third is the
startling use of a saxophone - one of those brazenly colouristic effects
which mark out the composer's later symphonies.
Davis tilted into the performance with gusto, and the result was a bitingly
exuberant sound, crackling with trombones, a sound at once bitter and
buoyant as the mood of the piece demands. The third movement's hysterical
tumult and the Epilogue's oddly disconcerting ethereal serenity were well
caught. If the Moderato second movement with its eerily lamenting strings
and drum alarums suggested Ives or Shostakovich at half-cock, that was not
the conductor's fault.
Whereas Vaughan Williams made something new or newish out of a traditional
form, the St. Nicolas cantata, Op. 42, with which the 35 year old Britten
astonished the congregation at Lancing College Chapel a few months after the
76 year old's symphony was premiered is utterly original, a work of amazing
genius and simplicity. The simplest strokes are typically those of purest
genius, as when the solo treble's refrain 'God be Glorified]' in the
waltzing 'Birth of Nicolas' is dramatically taken over at the end by the
mature tenor with an accompaniment of loudly ceremonious organ chords.
One missed the power of a cathedral instrument at that point, but Benjamin
Dawson's treble, wafted from on high, was exquisite and Anthony Rolfe
Johnson's tenor here and throughout was passionate, atmospheric,
magnificent. The church rituals of the work (including congregational hymns)
were well-faked, and the BBC Symphony Chorus and (placed on the lower
balcony) women of Trinity College of Music Chamber Choir sang with keen
clarity and beauty.

LEONARDO AND VENICE Sponsored by Fiat Palazzo Grassi until July 5
This year, through the early summer, the Palazzo Grassi, Fiat's cultural
institute on the Grand Canal at Venice, offers us an art historical and
aesthetic treat. Leonardo &amp; Venice (until July 5: sponsored by Fiat) is a
sustained attempt to see him not as the profound and unique master, sui
generis, which is how he is customarily regarded, but set rather into the
proper working context of his time. As such it immediately breaks new ground
and could hardly be more important, for all that it leaves the visitor not
unconvinced but as tantalised as ever.
The questions pour in. Why Leonardo and Venice: why not Florence, most
obvious all; why not Milan, Rome, France? Leonardo was born in 1452 and died
in 1519, yet beyond the well established framework his life remains a
shadowy and uncertain affair. Details, circumstances, movements emerge
elliptically here and there, by chance reference, a note here, pure surmise
there. We know that he travelled widely, especially during his first long
period at the Sforza court at Milan, from 1482 until 1499. Yet we are
certain of only one visit to Venice, of three months early in 1500.
The choice of Venice, therefore, may be one more of opportunity than
priority, yet in the event it proves entirely justified. There is an
important group of drawings by Leonardo in the collections of the Accademia
at Venice. How they came to be in Venice in the first place is uncertain.
Were they left by the master himself, fragments scattered around the studios
he worked in or visited in his brief stay, to be collected later? Whatever
the case, they had not been shown before in an international context. Here
they are set out in the themes into which they naturally fall - adorations,
military studies, the proportions of the figure, studies for the Last
Supper, Madonnas, heads, grotesques - and, for the first time, compared
directly with works from the worlds's principal Leonardo collections, most
notable of all the Royal Collection at Windsor.
Insensibly, with the presentation of each theme, so the broader implications
are registered, the connections made which the second half of the exhibition
proposes and explores. One commentator in the wonderfully exhaustive and
exhausting catalogue - for it is nearly two inches thick - supposes those
three months in 1500 too short a time in which to come to terms with the
richness and complexity of Venetian art. Perhaps so, but there was rather
less of it then than now - no Titian as yet, no Tintoretto, no Veronese, and
no San Giorgio in its present state, no Redentore, no Salute. Leonardo was a
remarkable man and already a celebrity, and commonsense suggests he would
have the freedom of the place to see what he wanted to see, meet whom he
wished to meet.
The questions begged are what he knew if it already, of Bellini in
particular, and what was known of him, that would affect the rising
generation of Giorgione, Sebastiano and the precocious Titian. Can it really
have been so, that Leonardo, with all his natural curiosity, made only the
one visit to that magical city? The exigencies of travel in the late
quattrocento notwithstanding, Milan was not so very far away. His schemes
for the hydraulic defences of the Veneto presuppose a certain familiarity
with local resources and terrain. The magnificent equestrian monument to
Colleoni by Verrocchio, the master in whose studio he had worked and studied
in the 1470s, completed but uncast before his death, had been set up before
the great church of SS Giovanni e Paolo in 1496, where it still stands.
Certainly the progress of Leonardo's great mural painting of the Last Supper
was monitored through the later 1490s far beyond Milan, and at Venice
curiously it is in sculpture quite as much as in painting that the reference
is made apparent. The Ca' d'Oro relief attributed to the studio of Tullio
Lombardo is an almost direct transliteration into stone of the central group
of figures in the composition. And Lombardo's exquisite pair of heads in
bas-relief, from Vienna, clearly casts that mood of gentle, almost elegiac
ecstasy so characteristic of Leonardo's adoring Madonnas. It is perhaps too
fanciful to sense, in return, in the general composition of the Last Supper,
with its high and frontal presentation, a formal echo of the high stage-like
chancel of Pietro Lombardo's Santa Maria dei Miracoli, finished in 1489.
It is upon this quality of mood, atmosphere and emotion, intangible at the
best of times, that the question of Leonardo's lasting influence upon
Venetian painting would seem to rest. In particular it rests upon the
equally shadowy and debatable figure of Giorgione, who held the pass between
Bellini and Titian, and died too young. Leonardo had nothing technical to
teach such a master as Bellini, yet is it entirely true that Bellini's work
lacks the emotional force that Leonardo was able to pass on to the younger
man? Bellini's work can be as moving as anything of anyone's, as his Madonna
with St Catherine and the Magdalen here clearly proves, yet the emotional
force is contained, implicit, contemplative rather than openly expressive.
With Leonardo comes something more actively emotional and expressive which,
being more active, brings with it a sense of realism that, within the
context of Italian art, is quite new. And to move on from Bellini and
Leonardo to Giorgione's extraordinary painting of la Vecchia, an ageing
woman, worn out by work but not yet ravaged by age, is to confront one of
the first great images of the modern era. We look on, suddenly, to
Velasquez, Goya, Gericault, Degas . . . Such is the Maniera Moderna of
Venice and Leonardo around 1500, albeit not quite the modern manner the
renaissance scholar might choose to admit.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Technology (Technically Speaking): An election vote for
science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY senior scientists have made a valiant effort to make science an issue
in the UK general election, by writing to the Times to protest at the
damaging impact of Conservative policies on research (though they could not
bring themselves to endorse either Labour or the Liberal Democrats instead.)
If they are even half right in claiming that the decline in scientific
morale is 'one of the principal disasters in Britain in the past 12 years,'
then science and technology deserve a far higher profile than they have had
in the campaign so far.
The party manifestos make only a few glancing references to science. The
Conservatives put forward a general statement of their belief in investing
in research but no new ideas. The Liberal Democrats have plenty to say about
environmental research but little about science, apart from promising an
immediate boost in spending on basic research. Labour is not offering
scientists more money straightaway but does have a few innovative proposals,
including a cabinet-level minister for science and a 25 per cent tax credit
to encourage R&amp;D.
There are several reasons why science habitually occupies a low place in the
hierarchy of electoral issues. One is simply that scientists tend to be less
interested in politics than other professional groups. They are too
preoccupied with their experiments, and increasingly with writing proposals
for research grants, to devote time and energy to lobbying politicians.
There are a few exceptions to this general rule - most notably Denis Noble,
the Oxford physiology professor who organised the Save British Science
campaign.
At the same time politicians are uncertain about the real purpose of
investing in science. As the Conservative manifesto says, research 'enriches
the quality of our lives and provides the feedstock of industrial
innovation'.
But the view of science as a cultural activity puts it into competition for
funds with the arts, which are much less expensive to sustain. And the link
between science and industrial success is hard to prove; it operates on a
timescale of decades - beyond the horizons of electoral politics.
The issue is clouded further by various myths and misconceptions. One is
that Japan achieved its triumph in industry without a strong science base
and is now investing in basic research as a luxury it can afford.
To make matters worse for science, there is a folk memory in British
politics about Harold Wilson's 'white heat of technology' campaign in the
1964 election. That was exciting at the time but after it had congealed into
a series of technological white elephants, the feeling was that the campaign
had made Wilson and the Labour party look slightly ridiculous in the long
run.
The 'white heat' campaign has made it less likely that British politicians
will get really excited about science and technology again. There is
certainly no chance of that happening during the current campaign.
The politician with the strongest grasp of scientific issues today is Jeremy
Bray, Labour's science spokesman since 1983. His patient low-key style has
won friends for Labour in university science departments and research
institutes but many doubt whether he could bargain forcefully for extra
funds as science minister in a cash-strapped Labour government.
None of the three party leaders shows much personal interest in science,
though Paddy Ashdown is keen on aerospace and information technology. But as
the former research chemist Margaret Thatcher showed, a scientific
background offers no guarantee that a politician will take a sympathetic
attitude to the subject. Many scientists believe that another government
headed by John Major would treat research better than the Thatcher
governments of the 1980s.
Whatever the outcome on April 9, the best way for scientists to ensure
better treatment for R&amp;D is to speak out more forcefully in public. Their
statement yesterday was a good start.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Technology: Sparks fly over electric car - Fiat is
undeterred by the limits of batter power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Next month Fiat, the Italian car maker, will start selling an
electrically-powered version of the Cinquecento, its new Polish-built mini
car.  At around L26m (Pounds 12,000) in Italy, the Cinquecento Elttra will
cost roughly 2.6 times as much as a well-equipped petrol version.
It will have a maximum range of 70km in urban driving conditions and a top
speed of 80kph.  Where the rear seats of the conventional model will
accommodate two adults in surprising near-comfort, the Elettra has only a
raised platform behind the front seats, beneath which resides a lead acid
battery pack weighing more than 700lbs.  The Elettra is thus strictly a two
seater.
Even the most senior figures behind its introduction, Ettore Panizza,
technical director of Fiat's electrical and electronic systems division, and
Fabio Massimello, production and marketing director of its electrical
vehicles programme, acknowledge that its performance is 'miserable' in
comparison with the Cinquecento's petrol-engined versions.
The Elettra, like an electric version of the more basic Panda which preceded
the Polish-built car into production, exists because it is Fiat's conviction
that Italy's cities will soon legislate and electric vehicle industry into
being.
The legislation will not be identical to that of California, where any
manufacturer wishing to sell more than 35,000 cars a year will have to make
at least 2 per cent of them 'zero emissions' (electric) starting in 1988.
But Massimello forecasts that it will be just as effective.
From 1994-95, he says, cities across Italy will start closing their centres
to all but electric cars.  Limited closures are already taking place in
Modena and Florence, where pollution monitoring equipment shows unhealthy
pollution levels being reached.  But so far they have been mostly haphazard,
temporary or - as in the case of Rome - simply flouted through loopholes.
As the trend spreads, so Fiat sees its electric car sales inexorably rising.
 'At present, I think we will sell only 150-200 in 1992-93, rising to
400-500 in 1994 and 1,000-1,500 in 1995,' says Massimello.  'But then we see
a sharp rise - to 5,000 in 1996, 10,000 in 1997 and 20,000 in 1998.'  By
2000, Fiat expects the Italian market alone to be absorbing 70,000.
Massimello agrees with Jean Yves Helmer, director in charge of the electric
vehicles programme at France's Peugeot, that by the end of the decade Europe
overall will be providing a market of between 200,000-250,000 electric cars
a year.
Like Peugeot, Fiat stresses the financial burden of developing purpose-built
EVs (electric vehicles) for a market that currently does not exist.  'But at
a volume of 10,000-15,000 units a year it becomes financially viable to
develop and manufacture purpose-built electric cars,' says Panizza.
'Ordinary' cars such as Cinquecento or Peugeot 106 are not ideal for
adaptation.  Produced in steel, they are heavy, and lack specially designed
bulbous bodyshell which could compensate for the bulky battery and allow
more room for passengers.
Perhaps the ultimate current demonstration of what purpose-building an
electric car can achieve is provided by the General Motors Impact.
Lightweight composite materials and low-drag aerodynamics give it a top
speed of more than 100mph.  Production is scheduled to start in three or
four years.  However, neither Fiat nor Peugeot is concerned about such high
performance - at least for Euopean Markets.
They see electric cars 'as little car for the city only', says Massimello.
After a great deal of market research, Fiat has found that most people
require a maximum range of 35km per day.  Since the average speed of traffic
in a typical Italian city is 12-15 kilometres an hour, the range seems
sufficient.
Even so, the Elettra is likely to be bought by only the most ardent - and
well-heeled - environmentalist.  Not surprisingly, after more than a year of
availability, the electric Panda has sold almost exclusively in companies
with a vested interest in the electricity supply industry.
To ease the transition, Fiat's EV programme leaders expect future
governments to provide VAT exemption and possibly other fiscal incentives to
encourage EV's.
'It is very important to try to get cost closer to that of an ordinary car,'
says Massimello.  'A customer might be expected to pay 10-15 per cent extra,
not 2.6 times extra,' he says.  Not least, he acknowledges, this is because
there is little prospect of an EV ever being a direct substitute for an
'ordinary' car,  'It will be only the second or third vehicle in a family,'
he believes.
The EV industry's development in Europe has serious implications for
component suppliers.
Fiat believes that a pan-European collaboration is required between
manufacturers.  To help make that possible, there is a perceived need for an
EC legislative framework to deal with safety and other construction and use
implications as the industry develops.
European legislators should be helped by the example of the US, which is
already much ahead in assessiong issues such as the chemical safety of some
advanced batteries - high-temperature sodium-sulphur, for example - and
permissible voltages within the power train.
The electric motors, charging systems, accumulators and other technical
ingredients of the Elettra come from several souces, including in-house Fiat
operations.  In no sense do they represent a long-term commercial supply
structure.
The current price disadvantage of all electric cars requires a big effort to
achieve economies of scale in component production, Panizza stresses.
It should be possible to halve the current costs.  But that means Europe's
car makers agreeing to share core componentry.  For example, although Fiat
has the capability to build an electric drivetrain in house, 'suitable
electric motors need to be produced at a rate of at least 1,000 a day to get
a financial return', says Massimello.  So it would make sense, he suggests,
for production to rest with specialist motor producers already expert in the
field.
There is already a trend in Europe towards sharing research and development
in areas such as batteries, according to Fiat.
And in the US, a collaborative project between General Motors, Ford,
Chrysler and federal agencies is spending Dollars 1.2bn over the next decade
to establish the most promising new battery technologies.
The sharing of specifications at an early stage may mean that the
purpose-built electric cars of the late 1990s will share - under their
differing skins and manufacturers' labels - components that are mostly
common and this relatively inexpensive.

FT  24 MAR 92 / People: Stout returns to academe at LBS
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After 10 years as head of economics at Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch
nappies-to-detergents group, Professor David Stout is returning to academic
life as the new director of the Centre for Business Strategy at the London
Business School.
Stout, now 60, an Australian Rhodes Scholar, was a Fellow of University
College, Oxford, for 16 years and economic director of the National Economic
Development Office (Nedo) during the 1970s.
Like his predecessor, Professor John Kay, who stood down from the post last
year, Stout leans more towards industrial economics than what many business
executives would understand by strategy.
Nevertheless, Stout, who will take up his new post at the start of August,
has a clear idea of the direction in which he wants to take the Centre.
In what he describes as his 'mission statement', he says he intends to make
the Centre 'a workshop on industrial economic success', which will study the
impact of public policies on business strategy and competitive performance,
and try to establish how success can be spread within and between different
sectors of the economy.
Stout says the Centre, which is largely funded by the Gatsby Foundation and
is one of six research centres at LBS, will tackle economic performance in
three ways: first, the dynamics of corporate growth and success; second, the
effective design of public policy and its impact on industrial performance;
and third, to test the results of these two approaches, it will examine key
sectors such as biotechnology and fast moving consumer goods, where he says
Britain has latent competitive advantage.

Barrister Stephen Fielding has joined City solicitors Titmuss Sainer &amp; Webb
as the partnership's first director of business development.
Fielding, who was called to the Bar in 1974, but shortly after went to work
in the financial services sector, first as a lawyer to the Building
Societies Association then to Midland Bank, says he has not this time been
hired as a lawyer but rather for his 'business management capacity'.
Titmuss Sainer was one of the first City law firms to establish a marketing
department, though it lost Linda Phelan, who had been responsible for
setting it up, at the end of last year, and her replacement has also
subsequently left.
Fielding says his job is 'business development - not just marketing'. This
he takes to amount to some input on strategic issues, with the partnership
currently engaged in an overhaul of strategy; attention to and promotion of
'the quality of service; and new business acquisition'.
Fielding, who is 40 and lists the Church among his interests, is proud of
his recent record as deputy chief executive of Midland Bank's personal asset
management business. 'It became a very fast-growing part of Midland,' he
asserts. Heavily dependent on the branch network, he admits it will be 'much
harder work' at Titmuss Sainer.

FT  24 MAR 92 / FT Law Report: Somalia money stays in court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPUBLIC OF SOMALIA v WOODHOUSE DRAKE &amp; CAREY (SUISSE) SA &amp; OTHERS
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hobhouse: March 13
1992
MONEY PAID into court as representing cargo owned by a foreign republic
whose government has been overthrown cannot be paid out to solicitors
instructed by the republic's 'interim government' if on the evidence it is
not a government, in that it does not exercise effective administrative
control over the republic's territory.
Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when refusing an application by the 'interim
government' of the Republic of Somalia for payment out of court of funds
belonging to the Republic.
HIS LORDSHIP said that in January 1991 the Republic of Somalia bought and
paid for a cargo of rice which was shipped on the Mary to be discharged at
Mogadishu.
When the Mary arrived off Mogadishu, the master refused to enter port
because of the fighting there.
Bills of lading covering the cargo were in the hands of a Madame Bihi,
Somalia's ambassador to the UN. Disputes arose as to what should be done
with the cargo.
The shipowners issued an originating summons on March 12 1991 naming as
defendants the charterers of the vessel.
Mr Justice Hirst ordered that the cargo be sold and that the net proceeds of
sale be paid into court, and be treated as if they were the cargo. He
ordered Madame Bihi to place the bills of lading at the court's disposal to
facilitate the carrying out of the order.
In December 1990 and January 1991 there had been an uprising in Somalia in
the course of which President Siad Barre had been overthrown. The central
government ceased to exist. Various groups put themselves forward as
entitled to control or govern parts or the whole of Somalia.
The area around Mogadishu was controlled by the USC group but that split
into two factions, one led by General Aidid and the other by Mr Ali Mahdi
Mohammed.
Further south, different areas were under the control of the SDM and SPM
groups and the followers of Siad Barre. No one group had established control
over the country.
Madam Bihi had been appointed by President Barre's government. She remained
deeply hostile to the USC (particularly Mr Mahdi), who were equally hostile
to her. She contended that there was at present no government of the
Republic of Somalia.
In July 1991, after continuous fighting between the various groups, a
conference was called at Djibouti attended by the Presidents of Kenya and
Uganda and representatives of the governments of Germany, the US, France,
Italy, Saudi Arabia, Egypt, Libya, Yemen, Nigeria, Ethiopia, Sudan, Oman,
the USSR, China, the Arab League, the Organisation of African Unity and the
EC. From within Somalia six of the groupings were represented. The SNM and
General Aidid did not attend.
The conference reached an agreement set out in a communique dated January 21
1991.
Under the Djibouti agreement, Mr Mahdi became interim President of the
Somali Republic for two years. He appointed Mr Qalib as prime minister. The
'interim government' had been unable to operate in Mogadishu. Mr Qalib was
based in a hotel in Riyadh.
Prior to the Djibouti agreement, on May 12 1991, Mr Qalib, describing
himself as the 'prime minister of the Somali Republic' and writing from
Riyadh, instructed solicitors, Crossman Block, to act on behalf of 'the
interim government of the Somali Republic'. By a further letter of January
14 1992, Mr Qalib gave his written consent for 'the interim government of
the Republic of Somalia' to be joined as plaintiff in the proceedings.
Following sale of the cargo and payment of the Dollars 2.35m proceeds into
court, on the application of Crossman Block as 'solicitors for the Republic
of Somalia', Mr Justice Saville ordered joinder of the Republic of Somalia
as plaintiff in substitution for the shipowners who together with the buyers
of the cargo were joined as additional defendants. He further ordered that
unless any party showed cause before February 19 1992 why Dollars 2m should
not be paid out of the fund to the solicitors for the Republic of Somalia,
it should be paid to Crossman Block.
Madame Bihi took advantage of the liberty to apply. She sought to be joined
as a party as a representative of the Democratic Republic of Somalia.
She claimed no personal interest in the money. The only locus standi (right
to be heard in court) she could have was as a person entitled to represent
the Republic of Somalia in court. It was clear from the evidence that Madame
Bihi had no such right. Her evidence was that there was currently no
government of Somalia. She had no diplomatic status in the UK, nor
government recognition as a representative of the Republic of Somalia. Her
application to be joined as a party was refused.
The question was whether the order for payment out to Crossman Block should
be confirmed.
Crossman Block's authority was contained in the letter of January 14 1992.
If the 'interim government' was not the government of the Republic of
Somalia, Crossman Block did not have authority to act on the Republic's
behalf.
The UK government's new policy not to confer recognition on governments as
opposed to states, was stated in two Parliamentary Answers in April and May
1980.
The Answers confirmed one applicable criterion of the locus standi of a
foreign 'government' - whether the relevant regime was able to 'exercise
effective control of the territory of the state concerned' and was 'likely
to continue to do so'. A statement as to what was to be the evidence of the
UK government's attitude provided another. It was to be inferred from 'the
nature of the dealings' the UK government had with the foreign government,
and whether they were on a normal government to government basis.
The Foreign and Commonwealth Office responded by letter to solicitors'
enquiries in relation to the litigation. It said the general situation in
Somalia continued to be insecure and confused; that the interim government
did not command nationwide acceptance; and that it was very difficult to
judge who was the government.
It said the UK maintained formal contact with all the factions involved, but
there had been no dealings on a government to government basis.
It was clear that the UK government did not consider that there was at
present any effective government in Somalia.
The statements in the letters from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office were
confirmed by other evidence concerning the actual situation in Somalia.
The criteria of 'effective control' referred to in the Answers were not
satisfied.
In Arantzazu Mendi (1939) AC 256,264-5, Lord Atkin said 'exercising
effective administrative control' meant 'exercising all the functions of a
sovereign government, in maintaining law and order, instituting or
maintaining courts of justice, adopting or imposing laws regulating the
relations of the inhabitants'.
The 'interim government' did not satisfy those criteria. The Republic had no
government.
The factors to be taken into account in deciding whether a government
existed were: (a) whether it was the constitutional government; (b) the
degree, nature and stability of administrative control it exercised over the
territory; (c) whether the UK government had any dealings with it and if so
what was the nature of those dealings; (d) (in marginal cases) the extent of
international recognition.
On the evidence the 'interim government' did not qualify.
Accordingly, Crossman Block did not at present have the authority of the
Republic of Somalia to receive and deal with its property. The instructions
and authority from the 'interim government' were not from the government of
the Republic.
No part of the sum in court should be paid out to Crossman Block without a
further order of the court.
For the plaintiffs: Geraldine Andrews (Crossman Block).
For Madame Bihi: Gavin Kealey (More, Fisher, Brown).
Amicus curiae: Stephen Richards (Treasury solicitor).

Are private investors a more fruitful source of finance for small businesses
than the formal venture capital industry? In the US, 'business angels' are
thought to provide at least twice as much finance as the venture capital
industry, though in the UK, angels are believed to be less active.
But evidence that private investors do have an important role to play comes
from figures from Venture Capital Report (VCR), a monthly newsletter
providing details of opportunities.
Of the 1,123 entrepreneurs featured between 1978 and 1990 who provided
feedback, 15 per cent received an offer for all the money they sought from a

heavy a cross to bear
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
You supply a long-established customer with Pounds 10,000 worth of goods
only to hear a week later he has gone out of business. Your normal credit
terms are 30 days, so you are still three weeks away from payment.
You then face the prospect of the liquidator or the administrative receiver
selling your consignment of goods to pay off the bank or one of the other
creditors.
The problem is that although you feel the delivery you made ought still to
belong to you, in law it does not. Unless you agree other terms with your
customers, the goods become theirs the moment your delivery lorry drops them
at the loading bay. How can you reduce the risk you run without demanding
cash in advance or some other change in terms which might persuade the
customer to switch to a rival supplier?
One method is to put a 'retention of title' clause into your terms of trade.
This is unlikely to frighten off sound customers but, if handled properly,
can increase your chance of being paid. Detailed advice* has been drawn up
the London Chamber of Commerce to clarify the confusion. Making a retention
of title clause stick can be difficult unless all the legal niceties have
been met.
All your terms of trade, including retention of title, must be communicated
to your customer before or at the time the contract is made, the chamber
advises. It is not sufficient to print the clause on your invoices since
these go out after the contract has been struck. It must be printed,
prominently, on all brochures and price lists, credit application forms,
quotations and customer order forms.
You must also make sure that your document outlining the terms of trade is
the last document to be sent out since this will usually be the one which is
held to be legally binding.
If you receive an order on a customer's own order form, you must, without
fail, send your own 'acknowledgment of order' form containing your terms.
If you print your retention of title clause on the back of any forms, you
should put a note on the front drawing the customer's attention to it. And
make sure the terms are printed in readable, clear type.
If your customer goes bust and you need to apply the clause, get in touch
immediately and make arrangements to recover your goods. If you cannot take
the goods away immediately, you should make an inventory or take
photographs. These must be signed and dated by your representative and by
your customer.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Management (The Growing Business): How to survive the
seven-year hitch / Investigation into the measures you can take to reduce
liability to inheritance tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This month's British Budget, with its relaxation of rules governing
inheritance tax, has made it easier for the next generation to prevent all
that it inherits in a family business from dissolving in the tax man's
grasp.
Norman Lamont, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, raised the threshold at
which inheritance tax comes into force and increased the reliefs on business
assets to take an estimated 900 businesses out of the tax net entirely in
1992-93, while lightening the burden on a further 1,600.
However, the imminence of a general election and the prospect of a Labour
government installing a less accommodating tax regime mean that business
owners should act fast to make the best use of existing tax rules, tax
specialists advise.
'It does not bring the Inland Revenue a lot of money but it can still be
important for the individual company if the owner dies young or
unexpectedly,' says Mavis Sargent, a tax partner at accountants Moore
Stephens.
The problem with planning for inheritance tax is that forces the business
owner to accept his or her own mortality, says David Bowes, a consultant
with accountants Grant Thornton. 'People don't think about it until they are
near retirement or they have a serious illness. They should do it much
earlier.'
Bowes cites the case of a businessman, a widower with children, who died in
his 50s. He had made no plans to reduce his exposure to inheritance tax so
his children arranged to pay it off over 10 years from dividends.
When the family business ran into a difficult patch and was unable to pay
any dividends, the children were forced to sell it to pay the tax. But
because the business was not doing well, they sold it for much less than
they would have achieved in more buoyant times.
So how should the business owner set about avoiding inheritance tax? A
popular way of reducing exposure to the tax is to make a lifetime gift (in
tax jargon, a 'potentially exempt transfer'). If the individual making the
transfer subsequently lives for seven years, there is no inheritance tax to
pay. Dying within seven years triggers a tax liability on a tapering scale.
The business owner could make an outright gift of shares but this can bring
problems: the children may be too young to take responsibility for the
business; someone else may gain control of the shares; or the owner may not
yet want to cede voting control over the shares.
The answer may be to set up a trust. This puts the shares into safe hands
and the trustees may include the owner and spouse. Trusts conjure up images
of offshore tax havens, brass name plates and shady lawyers but the reality
is more prosaic. The Inland Revenue calculated last year that there are
about 260,000 trusts in existence in the UK. Most are fairly small and only
4 per cent had an income of more than Pounds 25,000.
A simple, standardised trust document could be pulled off a solicitor's
word-processor for Pounds 200 but a custom-made trust for a family business
would cost between Pounds 1,000 and Pounds 2,000 in solicitors fees - less
outside London, says Mark Buzzoni, a partner at solicitors Baileys Shaw &amp;
Gillett.
Drawing up a trust deed could be completed within a week to 10 days with
much of the time taken up gathering information on the business and family
background.
Many trusts become dormant once they have been established and there will be
no administration costs until the time comes to take action under the
trust's terms. But if regular dividends are paid or investments are
reshuffled, there will be fees to pay to solicitors or accountants.
A trust allows an individual (the settlor) to retain control of his assets
but it also imposes limits.
The settlor cannot draw dividends from shares put into the trust, though his
wife can. Nor can the settlor get back the assets he put into the trust if
it is unwound. He cannot, for example, force his children to return any
shares he has given them through the trust. 'You give up ownership of the
shares and any rights to benefit for ever,' says Buzzoni.
Creating a trust should be left to a lawyer but there are points the family
owner should watch out for:
Do not start shifting assets around and making promises to your heirs before
taking legal advice. One business owner decided to put some land and shares
into a trust. He made the mistake of transferring the shares into the trust
 -so he no longer had a controlling stake - before transferring the land.
Since he no longer controlled the company when the land was transferred, he
was unable to claim the inheritance tax relief on the land. By reversing the
transactions, he would have saved his heirs a lot of money.
Make sure that the other shareholders are aware of what you are doing.
Gifting shares into a trust may trigger their pre-emption rights and a
dissident shareholder could create problems.
Remember that there is a 'tension' between the rules of inheritance tax,
which argue in favour of making a lifetime gift, and those governing capital
gains tax. The latter suggest it makes more sense to do nothing because
capital gains are 'washed out' on death.
Take out life assurance to meet any expected inheritance tax liability.
However, it may be difficult to judge how much cover is required because the
Revenue may not accept your valuation of the asset and you may not know the
tax rate which will apply.
Tax advisers do not expect all these tax breaks to remain in place if a
Labour government comes to power though it is unlikely that Labour would
make its legislation retroactive. This, coupled with the fact that share
values are low in the depths of the recession (tax is calculated on the
value of the assets at the time of the transfer) mean it makes sense to take
action before April 9, advisers suggest.
But even if the Conservatives are returned to power, there is every prospect
they will take a hard look at the taxation of trusts. In the past two years,
the government has tightened up the rules governing offshore trusts while a
recent government consultative paper questioned whether trusts should be
taxed differently from individuals.
The tax rules which affect the transfer of business assets from one
generation to the next have an important impact on the health of family
businesses. With an estimated 75 per cent of all UK companies under family
control, the overall economic impact is considerable.
         THE MAIN BUDGET PROPOSALS* FOR INHERITANCE TAX
Raising the tax threshold from Pounds 140,000 to Pounds 150,000 increasing
the higher rate of relief from 50 percent to 100 percent
for:
Interests in unincorporated business
Holdings of more than 25 percent in unquoted and USM companies increasing
the lower rate of relief from 30 percent to 50 percent
for:
Controlling holdings in fully quoted companies Holdings of 25 percent or
less in unquoted and USM companies
*Theses proposals were not included in the abbreviated Finance Act although
the tax threshold will increase to Pounds 147,000 on the basis of automatic
indexation

FT  24 MAR 92 / Export value up 8.5% last month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of UK exports rose 8.5 per cent last month to reach Pounds 9bn,
government figures showed yesterday. Imports rose 6.5 per cent in the month
to Pounds 10.1bn.
In the three months to February the value of exports was 1 per cent higher
than in the previous three months and 5.5 per cent higher than a year
earlier. The three-monthly trend for imports showed them 1.5 per cent higher
than in the previous three-month period and 4 per cent higher than a year
before.
Last month's deficit in the current account, which covers trade in goods,
services and certain transfer payments, was Pounds 750m, about Pounds 250m
worse than the market forecast of Pounds 500m. It compared with a revised
deficit in January of Pounds 858m.
Imports measured in terms of volume rose faster than exports, and the volume
of imports excluding oil and erratics in the three months to February rose 3
per cent compared with the three months to November last year while exports
rose by only half as much.
The visible trade deficit - trade in merchandise goods - improved slightly
last month, falling from Pounds 1.2bn in January to just over Pounds 1bn in
February. However, this was the second consecutive month in which the
visible trade deficit had exceeded Pounds 1bn. The poor figure was caused
partly by weaker trade in oil and erratics. The surplus on these two items
was only Pounds 72m last month compared with a surplus of Pounds 187m in
January.
The estimate of the surplus on invisible earnings such as banking, insurance
and tourism was held at Pounds 300m.
A breakdown of exports and imports measured by value shows that imports of
manufactured goods, excluding erratics such as aircraft and precious stones,
grew by 2 per cent in the latest three months while exports of manufactured
goods rose 2.5 per cent.
Imports of finished manufactures, which include consumer durables and cars,
grew by 2.5 per cent in the three months to last month, ahead of exports
which grew by 2 per cent.
Within finished manufactures the outlook for the UK motor industry was
bleak. Exports of cars fell 4.5 per cent in the three months to February
while imports rose 13 per cent.
However, the value of imports of capital goods rose 1.5 per cent in the
latest three months compared with the previous three months while exports
fell 1 per cent. Mr John Major, the prime minister, said the rise in imports
of capital goods was a sign that companies were investing in plant and
equipment.
The value of chemicals exports, one of the few buoyant sectors of the
economy, rose 2.5 per cent in the latest three months compared with the
three months to November and by 12 per cent on the year.
Imports of food, beverages and tobacco, measured by value, rose by 5.5 per
cent in the latest three months and by 13 per cent on the year.
Britain's surplus on trade in oil fell slightly in February to Pounds 0.1bn
compared with Pounds 0.2bn in January.
The fall in exports to the European Community registered in January was
reversed last month. Exports to the EC rose 2 per cent in the three months
to last month compared with the previous three months and by 5.5 per cent on
the year. Exports to north America fell 0.5 per cent.
Imports from the EC rose by 2 per cent on the three-monthly basis and by 3
per cent compared with a year ago.

FT  24 MAR 92 / ITC to advertise for Channel 5 licence bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Independent Television Commission said yesterday it plans to advertise
the licence for Channel 5, the new television channel able to reach three
quarters of the population.
Channel 5 will cause interference on video recorders and home computers and
the successful bidder will have to pay for the retuning of all the affected
equipment. The plans were suspended while the commission looked at how
potential bidders would cope with this.
The ITC said yesterday comments from potential applicants 'indicated that
the extent of the retuning problems is recognised and that serious
consideration has been given to solving them'.
The licence will now be advertised in early April. The aim is to award the
licence by the end of October and the winner is expected to be on air by the
end of 1994.
The applicants will include Mr Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest and FiveTV, a
consortium supported by Canadian broadcaster Mr Moser Znaimer.
Mr Stephen Castell, an information technology consultant who wants plans for
Channel 5 to include options for a digital network for business, said the
ITC would not rule out the use of digital transmission when the licence was
advertised.

FT  24 MAR 92 / View from Washington: Different strokes for similar folks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS purely coiecidental that on March 11 President George Bush held a
press conference only hours after the British general election was called.
What was remarkable, given the subdued level of interest in British politics
in this country, was that he was asked a question about it.
That question was predictable, and could have been asked - indeed, might
even have been invited - when Mrs Margaret Thatcher and President Reagan
were in office. It was whether or not the president was concerned that the
Labour party, saddled with - by implication - unsound foreign and defence
policies, might win.
Mr Bush responded artfully, praising Mr John Major as a solid partner in the
western alliance but adding that the worst thing he could do was to be seen
to intervene with a preference in any important foreign election. Some
thought that his praise of Mr Major amounted to just that.
Obviously, a conservative administration in Washington prefers a
conservative government in London. As vice-president and president, Mr Bush
has dealt with the Thatcher and Major governments for more than 11 years.
There is no reason to doubt that his personal relationship with Mr Major is
close and warm.
However, the president was also diplomatic enough to welcome Mr Neil Kinnock
to the White House in 1990 and to say that if the Labour leader became prime
minister, he would welcome the opportunity to do business with him.
Mr John Newhouse, a staff writer with New Yorker magazine, says: 'Major is
fuzzily regarded as a good thing while Kinnock did not make a very good
impression.' But he adds: 'I don't think Kinnock's the sort who would
frighten our children.'
He also notes that 'we are both having (elections) at the same time, which
is unusual' - the last time there were general elections in the same year
was 1964 - 'and they do make us inward-looking'.
Comparisons between the two incumbents are commonplace. Both succeeded
distinctive leaders, both head parties well into the second decade of
executive power, both have oppositions moving towards the centre, and both
preside over weak economies. Both have also had to endure much sniping from
the right wings of their respective parties.
However, the probability is that the US economy will 'come right' for Mr
Bush later this year in a way that it cannot for Mr Major before April 9.
Both leaders - in the British Budget and in Mr Bush's war with Congress over
a reflationary package - claim that they have turned their economies around,
with the principal platform of not increasing taxes.
If the Tories lose, it might be seen as a harbinger for Mr Bush and the
Republicans. But the political differences between the two countries are so
great as to make such conclusions very speculative. The British embassy
reports that it spends most of the time devoted to the UK election
explaining these differences, but concedes that it has not been inundated
with requests for clarification.
However, honesty also requires reporting that nothing in the British
campaign has attracted America's attention as much as the end of the
marriage of the Duke and Duchess of York. That is a real story.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: An important edge lies with the local hero -
Loyalty counts with Lancashire voters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY in the nationalist heart of Lancashire might someone instantly
recognise what Butch Cassidy's father and Sir Cyril Smith have in common.
There the accident of birth matters. But an even more important test, which
Mr Cassidy senior so dismally failed and Sir Cyril gloriously passed, was
local loyalty - whether you stayed or whether you left. It is an issue which
in the next three weeks will have an impact on which political party forms
the next government.
Rochdale, the four marginals immediately to the north of it and the rogue
seat of Ribble Valley will on April 9 all reveal in their different ways
whether a personal following can offset a national trend.
While Ribble Valley, which a year ago delivered a by-election rebuff to the
Tories, should revert to the Conservative camp, Rochdale, Rossendale and
Darwen, Hyndburn and Pendle are all seats Labour would win with a swing of 5
per cent.
The Liberal Democrats have gambled in choosing the actress Liz Lynne to
defend Sir Cyril's 2,799 majority at the last election.
She has sought to become as local as it is possible to be without having
been born and brought up in Rochdale. Sir Cyril, though initially hesitant,
now appears more convinced that she could be a worthy successor.
But party workers on all sides know that since he won the seat in 1972 Sir
Cyril drew votes from Labour and Conservative. With his retirement, they
believe many of those voters may well revert to their national first
choices.
The Labour party is confident that the constituency remains instinctively
socialist and that recession, together with the feeling that the time has
come for a change of government, will be enough to give Mr David Williams
the seat.
But the Labour candidate is not without critics. A local councillor for 13
years, he is closely associated with controversial policies on land sales
and devolving council services. The depth of his hostility to the Gulf war
and to the poll tax may have frightened off as many voters as it won
adherents among the sizeable Asian Moslem community.
Up the road in Rossendale Sir Cyril and Rochdale persists. Mr David
Trippier, minister of state for the environment, a Rochdale man who fought
against, admired and learned from the former MP, is defending a majority of
4,982. Ms Janet Anderson, his Labour opponent, looks to have made one of the
fastest campaign starts in Lancashire but will need all the momentum she can
sustain to unseat a man whose local ancestry is impeccable and who has since
1979 become practised at the tactics of defending a marginal.
Mr Trippier argues that voters in marginal seats appreciate their national
responsibilities and are therefore less likely to be easily swayed. He and
Mr John Lee in nearby Pendle took their seats in 1979 with
smaller-than-expected swings and would like to emulate Mr Kenneth Hargreaves
in Hyndburn. Against the national tide, Mr Hargreaves turned his majority of
22 into one of 2,220 four years later.
In Ribble Valley, Mr Nigel Evans, a Welshman, has had a year to ponder the
effects of poll tax, recession and not being from the region. Conservative
workers say he has grown on people, is more widely accepted and can be sure
of removing Michael Carr, the Liberal Democrat MP, by a margin of some
8,000-10,000 votes - still only half the Tory majority in 1987. Better, they
say, to have a Welshman representing Ribble Valley than one living in 10
Downing Street.
That, for north-east Lancashire, is not necessarily a winning argument. Even
some members of the younger generation remember that Gracie Fields, once she
became famous, virtually abandoned Rochdale for the less obvious pleasures
of Capri, but that George Formby remained forever a part of Lancashire and
was loved for it.

The Issues, Science
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMMERING dissatisfaction in Britain's laboratories with Conservative
science policy boiled over yesterday when 20 leading researchers called for
a change of government to reverse a 'dramatic deterioration in the quality
and depth of British science'.
In a letter to The Times, they said 'progressive erosion in public support
for research' since 1979 had demoralised the scientific community - a
development they described as 'one of the principal disasters in Britain in
the past 12 years'.
The group includes several of Britain's best-known researchers, including
the two Nobel laureates Dr Max Perutz and Professor Maurice Wilkins.
Although they emphasised that the letter represented their personal
opinions, most academic scientists would agree with their challenge to the
Tory view that public funding of basic research has increased by 24 per cent
in real terms since 1979.
University researchers say that growth in the official 'science budget'  -
the money spent by the five research councils - has been offset by a steep
fall in the government's contribution to research through the Universities
Funding Council. At the same time the cost of working at the frontiers of
research is rising faster than general inflation.
While the Tories maintain that British science remains in good health,
Labour and the Liberal Democrats echo the opinion of Save British Science.
The lobby group says that, measured by purchasing power, government support
for academic science has fallen 20 per cent since 1979.
One result of the reduced university funding is that laboratories are
staffed increasingly by researchers on low-paid, short-term contracts whose
career prospects are often bleak. Another is that scientists spend more time
on paperwork, chasing grants, and less on experiments.
'The last 10 years have put an enormous bureaucratic load on us and that
needs to be stripped away,' says Dr John Sulston, a senior researcher at the
Medical Research Council's Laboratory of Molecular Biology in Cambridge.
'And I recognise that I'm working in a privileged community here, which has
been relatively well-treated.'
The Liberal Democrats promise an immediate injection of Pounds 400m a year
into the science base. Labour is more circumspect and avoids making a
financial commitment.
Even so, laboratory conversations suggest that Labour is generally regarded
as the party most friendly to science. Mr Jeremy Bray, a mathematician who
is Labour's long-serving science and technology spokesman, has toured
academic and industrial research centres listening to gripes and explaining
Labour policies.
Labour is the only party promising a cabinet-level minister for science  - a
job that would almost certainly go to Mr Bray.
No senior Conservative politician has an equivalent long-term interest in
science, responsibility for which has passed between a series of junior
ministers in the Department of Education and Science.
Although industrial research and development has increased since 1979, all
three parties agree that British industry should be encouraged to spend more
on R&amp;D.
The most distinctive proposal is Labour's 25 per cent tax credit for
additional R&amp;D investment. The Conservatives and Liberal Democrats say this
would encourage accountants to reclassify existing spending as R&amp;D, and even
for the high-tech companies on Cambridge Science Park the tax credit seems
to have relatively little appeal.
Mr Robin Smith-Saville, managing director of satellite communications
company Signal Processors, says its priority is an increase in Department of
Trade and Industry grants for innovative product development - support that
almost disappeared during the 1980s in the enthusiasm for collaborative
'pre-competitive' research.
'The extension of DTI support for innovation is most likely to be
forthcoming in a hung parliament because the Labour and Liberal Democrat
parties are more receptive to the need for this type of support than the
Conservatives,' Mr Smith-Saville says.
The three parties have similar German-inspired policies for bridging the gap
between academic science and industry. All promise to set up technology
development centres similar to Germany's Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft, a network
of 46 industrial research institutes.
For Dr Eric Howells, director of Cambridge University's Wolfson Industrial
Unit, this unanimity is 'almost too good to believe'. He and others in the
business of exploiting academic research are enthusiastic about
Fraunhofer-style institutes, whether they are called Faraday Centres (as the
Tories propose) or Newton Institutes (Labour).
But many university researchers are irritated by the way politicians see
science primarily as a tool for strengthening industry, and are angry about
the way 'scientists got the blame for Britain's industrial failure', as
Professor Michael Pepper, a Cambridge University physicist, puts it.
Prof Pepper insists - contrary to current political wisdom - that in his
field of solid-state physics 'links between universities and industry are
very good'. For university scientists like him the overriding issue is not
improving links with industry, but correcting what they see as underfunding
of basic research.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour attacks trade figures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK pressed home Labour's claim to be the party of exports and
industry yesterday by using a whistlestop visit to the Midlands to launch a
'manufacturing manifesto'.
The 'Made In Britain' presentation in Birmingham - Labour's first big
election news conference outside London - was stage-managed to coincide with
publication of the latest trade figures, which showed that Britain recorded
a deficit of Pounds 750m last month.
Mr Kinnock described the figures as 'quite dreadful'. He added: 'What is
really concerning about them is that we have got an economy which is at best
flat and possibly still slipping backwards.
'The government should have taken action recommended by the Labour party a
long time ago to get an investment-led recovery.'
In what is expected to be the party's last initiative on the economy before
a shift to its public services' agenda today, Mr Kinnock argued that tax
breaks for investment alongside training and employment schemes would
'stimulate activity and build confidence'.
The Labour leader's case was backed by Mr Gordon Brown, the shadow trade
secretary, who unveiled a modest three-point programme of additional steps
to flesh out Labour's already published Pounds 1.1bn industrial recovery
programme.
The measures included grant aid for engineering investment, an 'Inventions
in Britain' project to help small companies bring innovations to production,
and the creation of regionally-based export advice centres.
Earlier, asked how he would control inflation, Mr Kinnock said that a
combination of the constraints imposed by membership of the exchange rate
mechanism, supply-side measures and credit controls would prove adequate to
contain price rises. He rejected suggestions that a national minimum wage
would lead to escalating pay claims.
Labour would make economic growth a higher priority than achieving nil
inflation if the cost of eliminating price rises was to 'devastate' the
economy, Mr Kinnock said. 'We are not prepared to see the economy laid waste
in order the get zero inflation when we could have a thriving economy, an
investing economy, a high-employment and high-wage economy, with a very
modest level of inflation.'
He backed comments on Sunday by Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor, that
he would be satisfied by a rate of price rises paralleling the European
Community average.
Mr Kinnock dismissed a suggestion that his plans for a national economic
assessment amounted to a repeat of the National Plan, launched by Labour in
the 1960s. The differences lay in ERM membership and a greater emphasis on
the government in partnership with the private sector, rather than imposing
planning on it.

LABOUR claimed victory in the race for the postal vote as registration
closed yesterday.
More than 20,000 students have registered to vote Labour by post in marginal
constituencies where they study, according to the National Organisation of
Labour students.
The Conservatives said they had no figures for the total number of Tory
postal voters since campaigns to register them are organised locally.
Evidence from town halls is mixed and not all votes have yet been counted.
In Cambridge, where Conservative MP Mr Robert Rhodes James is retiring with
a majority of 560, the number of postal voters has doubled to 5,000, about 7
per cent of the electorate.
Disabled people, travelling workers, holidaymakers and students at home
during vacations can all apply for postal votes. The total number of postal
electors in 1987 was 907,725, about 2 per cent of the total vote.

LABOUR appears to be taking votes from the Liberal Democrats in Wales and
pulling in front of the Conservatives in several marginal seats, Anthony
Moreton writes.
According to an NOP poll conducted for the television company HTV at the
weekend, Labour may take Delyn from the Conservatives and consolidate its
tenuous hold on Clwyd South West. In the south it was doing well in Cardiff
Central and Pembroke and looked likely to hold its by-election gains in
Monmouth and the Vale of Glamorgan.
The survey offers some comfort to the Conservatives because it indicates
that the party is increasing its support in seats where there is a three-way
split with Labour and Plaid Cymru, the Welsh nationalists.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Heseltine attacks plans for credit controls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONSERVATIVES yes-terday seized on remarks made by Mr Neil Kinnock about
the operation of credit controls under a Labour government to question the
opposition's economic competence and inject life into their campaign.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, said the introduction of
controls would produce 'queues' for mortgages. 'We have always said from the
beginning of this campaign that mortgages under Labour would be more
expensive. Now you are going to have to queue for them as well.'
Mr Heseltine predicted that monthly mortgage payments would rise by an
average of between Pounds 40 and Pounds 50 under Labour because of higher
interest rates that would be needed to protect the value of the pound.
His attack sprang from the Labour leader's comments on the party's plans to
use credit controls in addition to interest rates to staunch price rises.
Housebuyers would rather wait 'a month or two' for loans than pay penal
interest rates, Mr Kinnock suggested. He said he would use temporary
controls based on banks' reserve:asset ratios if borrowing looked set to
rise unacceptably.
Mr Heseltine lambasted Mr Kinnock's 'economic illiteracy', saying it was
'utterly incredible that a delay of a month or two' could affect the level
of interest rates.
'How does he prevent foreign companies lending money across the exchanges
unless Labour is also threatening to reintroduce exchange controls?' he
asked.
His remarks came after weekend polls indicated that Mr John Smith, shadow
chancellor, had increased his lead in the popularity stakes over Mr Norman
Lamont, his opposite number, and that Labour's ratings for economic
competence were picking up.
Turning to the Conservatives' policies, Mr Heseltine promised a nationwide
rents-to-mortgages scheme which would enable 1.5m local authority tenants to
convert their present rent into a mortgage payment.
The scheme would not be open to the estimated 2.5m tenants who receive
benefit payments, however, and would therefore not amount to the phasing out
of the publicly-owned rental sector.
Mr Heseltine warned that Labour was 'committed to preventing' former council
tenants who purchased their homes under the 'right-to-buy' scheme from
selling at the best price on the open market.
He suggested that before any former tenant sold, he would 'have to get
permission from his local authority'.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Major attacks trade union plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR last night widened his assault on Labour's prospectus for the
1990s by calling the party's proposals for trade union legislation
'industrial euthanasia'.
The prime minister also used his speech at a rally in Sheffield to reiterate
the desire to create a 'classless society' which he expressed when he became
Conservative party leader in November 1990.
Labour, Mr Major said, would allow secondary strikes, prevent employers from
obtaining immediate court orders to stop unlawful strikes and take away from
individual union members the right not to take part in industrial action.
By contrast the Tories would ensure that unions gave at least a week's
notice of a strike and give the public new rights against the disruption of
public services by illegal wildcat strikes.
Mr Major said Mr Kinnock's party remained the same deep down despite policy
changes. 'Labour are like Sunday converts. They come to church on the
Sabbath, but boil the missionaries the rest of the week,' he said.
Mr Major attacked remarks by Mr Neil Kinnock yesterday morning in which he
committed Labour to reintroducing credit controls.
The policy was, he said, a typical socialist answer. 'Form a queue. Wait for
the state to tell you when you can buy a home. Wait for the state to tell
you when you can sell your house to someone who wants to buy it.'
Mr Major also claimed conservatism rather than socialism was the way of
breaking down social barriers. He highlighted his vision of 'a country in
which everyone is able to develop their talent to the full'.
He said: 'Our modern Tory party is for each and every person in Britain. We
want to banish for ever the artificial divisions in our society.'
Mr Major brushed aside criticism that the Tories' recent campaigning on
Labour's tax plans had been negative.
He said: 'The knives are out for Labour . . . in recent days I'm told that
Labour have been calling our campaign negative - good. That means our
attacks are getting home, that means they don't like it.'
Mr Major added: 'The only negative thing in this campaign are their policies
for Britain.'

FT  24 MAR 92 / Mrs Clinton stands with her man: The Democratic
front-runner's wife is something of a joint candidate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'HILLARY factor' and the role of Mrs Hillary Clinton, the wife of
Arkansas governor Bill Clinton, is emerging as a strong force in the
Democratic presidential primary campaign and a possible Clinton presidency.
As a full partner in her husband's campaign and a prominent lawyer in her
own right, Mrs Clinton, at 44, is as much a symbol of generational change in
national US politics as her husband. At first viewed as the 45-year-old
governor's secret weapon, she played a leading role in the nuts and bolts of
what has been a well-organised campaign.
However, her response last week to a spate of negative news stories about
connections between the state government and contracts granted to her law
firm has lifted her political profile. It may also have been something of a
lesson in why most candidates' wives confine their activities to sitting on
platforms and gazing adoringly at their husbands.
Speaking to journalists about how she might have to re-evaluate how she
conducts her career, Mrs Clinton blurted out: 'I suppose I could have stayed
home, baked cookies and had teas,' she said.
The remark was immediately seized on as a disparagement of women who forgo
careers to be housewives and mothers. Governor Clinton was forced to defend
it on television on Sunday. Insisting that Mrs Clinton 'believes that
rearing children is the most important work in our society', he said she had
been speaking of what could have been a 'largely ceremonial role' as
Arkansas state's First Lady.
Until then, Mrs Clinton was considered such a plus in the campaign that both
she and her husband like to say they are a 'two-for-the-price-of-one'
election bargain. She was certainly invaluable in parrying the womanising
charges which hovered over her husband until they came out in to open in the
Gennifer Flowers Affair.
When Ms Flowers, a part-time nightclub singer, told a supermarket tabloid
that she had had a 12-year affair with the governor, Mrs Clinton was at her
husband's side, urging voters in the New Hampshire primary to 'take the
election back from the sleazy tabloids'.
Most Americans got their first glimpse of Mrs Clinton's forceful personality
when the governor and his wife appeared on '60 Minutes', the top-rated US
television current affairs programme, to acknowledge implicitly that he had
strayed during his marriage.
However, said Mrs Clinton, 'I'm not sitting here, some little woman standing
by my man like Tammy Wynette (a country music singer). I'm sitting here
because I love him and I honour what he's been through and what we've been
through together. And if that's not enough for people, then heck, don't vote
for him.'
This kind of frankness can be alluring to many 'baby boomers' who admire her
independent mind and the equality of roles the couple seems to have
achieved.
Mrs Clinton's early press notices suggested she is tough where her husband
is more pliable. She could be, friends suggest, another Eleanor Roosevelt,
who was also considered more liberal than her husband.
While she has been named by the National Law Journal as one of 'the 100 Most
Influential Lawyers in America', her views are also under attack. In
scholarly articles and speeches, she has urged 'family policies' and
'children's rights', anathema to conservatives who fear the encroachment of
government into private lives (except on the abortion issue).
'Children should have a right to be permitted to decide their own future if
they are competent,' she has written. Also, she has argued, the US must
develop a comprehensive system of childcare, adapting to the reality that
most women now must work. (The Clintons have a 12-year-old daughter,
Chelsea.)
'If we compare our parenting policies in the workplace with those available
in our industrialised competitors around the globe, we seem to put less
actual value on the act of parenting than any other - despite our rhetoric,
despite the political talk about who can be more pro-family than the next
politician.'
Her views are, said The National Review, the conservative journal,
'chillingly . . . Swedish.'
No one knows how the 'Hillary factor' will play in the general election. In
Washington, observers wait for 'another high heel to drop' but she may have
already neutralised the issue.
Older voters may see her as a 'pushy' feminist. Certainly there could be
little more contrast with the maternal Mrs Barbara Bush or Mrs Marilyn
Quayle, wife of the vice-president, who earned a law degree but never
practised law.

PERU'S President Alberto Fujimori has returned from an eight-day visit to
Japan, the land of his ancestors, with an immediate Dollars 127m (Pounds

support.
He claimed his trip, which was concluded at the weekend, had 'removed the

Mr Fujimori became the first Latin American president and only the third
foreigner in 50 years to address the Diet, or parliament. The credits, which
are likely to be followed swiftly by Dollars 200m in export guarantee
credits, mean Japan has become Peru's principal foreign funding source,
accounting for 'well over Dollars 550m in under 12 months', said Mr
Fujimori.
This contrasts with what is perceived in Peru as US stinginess.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Political solution fades away for Kurds: The birth of an
independent Kurdistan would be very bloody
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST weekend's deaths in south-eastern Turkey after clashes between Kurdish
nationalists and Turkish soldiers look ominously like Turkish Kurdistan's
equivalent of the Boston Tea Party or the Dublin Easter Uprising of 1916.
The PKK Workers Party of Kurdistan seems to have been planning a widespread
popular revolt timed to coincide with the Kurdish spring festival of Newroz,
the Iranian and Kurdish new year,
For the coalition government of Mr Suleyman Demirel, which includes Kurdish
social democrats such as the foreign minister, Mr Hikmet Cetin, things could
hardly have turned out worse.
The government had been saying Newroz was a legitimate public holiday, but
that it should be celebrated peacefully. Now the government is faces
international censure for the deaths, while being criticised at home for
being too soft.
The uprising began on Friday morning as the festival was getting underway in
in Cizre, a town close to the Syrian border. Two pro-government village
guards, both ethnic Kurds and from a notable local clan, were found hanging
from lamp-posts in the main street with their mouths stuffed with money.
They had rejected warnings from other Kurds and refused to join the PKK.
Demonstrations followed and violence quickly erupted.
After such a start, it was perhaps inevitable - with the east full of
military reinforcements and tempers raging on both sides - that guns would
come out and lives would be lost.
It now looks very much as if a political solution to Turkey's problems with
the Kurds may be lost for ever.
Government estimates put the number Kurds at around 8m out of Turkey's
population of 58m. The Kurds themselves claim to be 20m. Outside observers
general concur at about 12m.
Rapid population growth has led to an influx of Kurdish migrants into big
cities such as Istanbul, Ankara, and Izmir.
For decades, Turkey has lived with the fiction that Kurds did not exist and
there was no such thing as the Kurdish language. The aim was to assimilate
the Kurdish minority into the Turkish mainstream.
That goal became more difficult after 1975 as economic development brought a
professional middle class of lawyers, engineers, and teachers to the
south-east who were attracted by Kurdish nationalism.
These political stirrings mostly began inside mainstream Turkish political
movements, but they were viewed with deep suspicion by the Turkish military
who remain convinced that violence is often effective in solving political
and cultural disputes.
A crackdown on all shades of Kurdish opinion seems to be the main reason why
in the early 1980s, a hardline Kurdish nationalist movement relying on a
military arm similar to the IRA displaced half a dozen older and less
violent Kurdish nationalist movements.
The PKK fed off central government repression. In 1984 it launched a
guerrilla war. It has also succeeded in getting the population of the
south-east united behind it.
The PKK is realistic about its prospects of ever detaching Kurdistan from
Turkey: Instead it has several times offered to negotiate on a federal
solution.
The idea is anathema to Turkish hardliners, who believe any concession to
Kurdish nationalism could lead to the collapse of the entire country.
The hardliners have lost a good deal of ground in recent years because the
Kurdish problem, has become so visible. The language is no longer forbidden.
Kurdish music was legalised in Turkey last year. There are now two
Kurdish-language newspapers.
If an independent Kurdistan is being born, its birth will be long, painful,
and very bloody.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Rocket failure cuts China's space edge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and YVONNE PRESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE failed launch of the Chinese Long March 3 rocket on Sunday, seen by
millions on live television, was more than just embarrassing for Beijing. It
could undermine China's efforts to take a slice of the lucrative
international commercial satellite launch market as well as raising costs
and causing delays for the whole of the satellite industry.
China is a new arrival in an industry ripe for increased competition.
Business is booming but there are only five players in the world: General
Dynamics of the US, Europe's Ariane, Russia's KB Salyut with its Proton
rocket, Japan's H2 rocket and China.
So operators of satellite services are desperate to maintain or raise the
number of launch suppliers. Intelsat, the international satellite
communications consortium, has a policy of spreading contracts to increase
the number of suppliers. Mr Olaf Lundgren, the secretary-general of
Inmarsat, the 64-member consortium which specialises in mobile
communications systems says: 'It would be very worrisome for there to be
less competition'.
China, and Russia, are selling on price. European or US launches cost
Dollars 50m-Dollars 75m each while China charges less than Dollars 40m
(Pounds 23m) per satellite.
The price advantage has meant a promising start. China joined the
competition for commercial launch services in 1987 and its first successful
launch was for a French company. In April 1990, Long March 3 put a
24-transponder communications satellite, AsiaSat-1, into space for a
Hong-Kong based consortium.
The programme has had problems, however. In December, a launch failed to put
its satellite in to the correct orbit. Sunday's was intended to restore
confidence.
If Long March 3 turns out to be unreliable, then satellite operators and
their customers in telecommunications and broadcasting face the prospect of
relying more on high cost western suppliers. They will also have to
reschedule launches and learn to live with the delays to new services.
This prospect has not yet upset the timetable for Long March 3. One Swedish
and two Australian satellites are due to be launched this year and the order
book stretches into the late 1990s.
China denies subsidising the industry. The Great Wall Industry Corporation,
responsible for the commercial launch business, attributes China's low
prices to low costs of materials and labour.
Price is not everything: since each satellite costs around Dollars 100m,
with insurance adding 15-18 per cent, operators need reliability too. New
competitors are likely to put in an appearance. Ukraine and Kazakhstan, once
part of the Soviet Union, have formed their own space agencies. India and
Israel have launch vehicles too.
China must move quickly to reassure existing and potential customers it is
in the first division of suppliers. Optus, the Australian satellite
operator, is confident the next launch attempt will be in weeks.

TURKEY'S prime minister, Mr Suleyman Demirel, yesterday promised to find a
peaceful solution to violent unrest in south-eastern Turkey in spite of a
third day of fighting in the area and a vow by Kurdish groups to launch a
campaign of civil insurrection.
Mr Demirel's first comments on the crisis came amid reports of continuing
clashes in Sirnak and Cizre in south-eastern Turkey, as security forces
sought to restore order after the worst violence in the eight-year-old
Kurdish troubles.
More than 60 people were killed in weekend clashes between security forces
and Kurdish demonstrators marking the start of the Kurdish new year in a
string of towns from the Syrian border through to Van, near the border with
Iran.
In London, a Kurdish spokesman said the weekend violence left Turkey's Kurds
with 'no alternative but to go to war' and said rebel groups were mounting a
campaign of insurrection.
Mr Akif Hassan, spokesman for the National Liberation Front of Kurdistan, a
political affiliate of the Kurdish Workers' Party (PKK), which is outlawed
in Turkey, said Kurds would 'mobilise in every town, city and in every part
of life' in a 'mass popular uprising'.
He claimed the government had forsaken any chance of a negotiated solution
to the Kurdish issue and instead had sent 'two thirds of the Turkish army'
into the region. 'Since peaceful means have been rejected,' he said, 'blood
will be shed.'
Mr Hassan claimed the weekend's fighting had left 88 Kurdish dead, including
29 in and around Cizre, 24 in Sirnak and 15 in the town of Nusaybin.
Kurds in Brussels smashed windows at the Turkish embassy in Brussels
yesterday, while more than 150 Kurds occupied a European Parliament building
for over five hours.
Turkey's official Anatolian news agency reported that demonstrators
supporting the PKK opened fire yesterday on government and police buildings
in Cizre. Army troop carriers were reported to have returned fire, but there
was no immediate word on casualties.
In Sirnak the interior ministry reported that security forces had cleared
the streets amid unconfirmed reports from Kurdish groups in London that
Turkish aircraft had bombed the town centre.
This week's violence represents a severe blow to hopes of an early
breakthrough in the troubles on the back of Mr Demirel's promise of Kurdish
reform.
The prime minister at the head of an uneasy coalition is now expected to
face growing pressure from the army and conservatives in his own party to
take a strong hand against the PKK.
Widespread arrests were again reported throughout the region as shopkeepers
refused to open, public transport came to a standstill, and children stayed
away from school in sympathy with the demonstrators. In Istanbul, 17 people
were arrested as police tightened security in anticipation of further PKK
violence in Turkey's western cities.
After sporadic clashes throughout the winter months, the government is now
preparing to head off the spring offensive by the PKK, as it seeks to
increase its influence in the south-east.

BRITAIN IS trying to break a deadlock with China over the future of land in
Hong Kong now used by British forces after Beijing assumes sovereignty over
the territory in 1997, Simon Holberton writes from Hong Kong.
Beijing wants to decide the future of all military land. Britain wants to
pass surplus acreage to the Hong Kong government, for use in new
development. It also has no wish to see People's Liberation Army troops
stationed in the centre of Hong Kong.
However, Britain is understood to be ready to offer China possession of the
Prince of Wales building, headquarters of British forces, on Hong Kong
island. The Tamar naval base, of which the Prince of Wales building is part,
would be a valuable development site.

FT  24 MAR 92 / France delivers stern message to Mitterrand: The president
and his party will struggle to recover from the regional poll results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MASSIVE popular rejection of the French Socialist Party in Sunday's
regional elections is a critical turning point in the presidency of Mr
Francois Mitterrand. It has finally destroyed the credibility of the
government of Mrs Edith Cresson; it has delivered a deeply damaging blow to
the prospects of the Socialist Party in next year's general elections; and
it has, as a result, inflicted a wound on the president himself from which
he may not recover.
Cumulatively, these problems may prove insuperable for the president and his
party. No-one in France would make the historic mistake of under-estimating
President Mitterrand's enormous powers of manoeuvre and survival. Yet there
is a palpable sense that France is entering the stormy waters of the end of
a regime, which may test his powers to breaking point and beyond. 'These
elections,' wrote Mr Serge July in yesterday's Liberation, 'mark without
doubt the end of the Mitterrand years.'
His most immediate problem is the credibility of the government. Faced with
the disavowal of more than 40 per cent of the Socialist Party's voters,
compared with the last general election of 1988, President Mitterrand is
bound to search around for some way of reversing the tide.
A common assumption is that he will dismiss Mrs Cresson, whose
record-breaking unpopularity must surely bear some of the responsibility for
the poor showing of the socialists in Sunday's vote, and replace her with a
more popular figure.
There is only one problem: it is not clear that there is any alternative
candidate who could restore the Socialist Party to public esteem. Mr Jacques
Delors, president of the European Commission, is repeatedly cited as by far
the brightest star in the socialist firmament; but he owes his considerable
popularity, at least as much to his distance from the discredit
contaminating the rest of the Socialist Party in France, as to the
international glamour of his role in Brussels.
In any case, it is hard to see how he could usefully answer a call of duty
from France's Socialist president, without at the same time throwing away
his European reputation. He owes a duty to all 12 governments; and his
immediate priorities are the follow-up to the Maastricht treaty and the
preparation of a Community policy towards the new candidates for membership.
If he were to leave Brussels early, he must surely give several months'
notice; but by then, he might have too little time to win back public
opinion to the Socialist Party.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the heavyweight finance minister, is manifestly only
too ready to offer his services as a replacement prime minister, and no
doubt he would be a safe pair of hands.
Since he also represents the personal guarantee of France's commitment to
the hard franc and a consistent anti-inflation policy, no doubt his
appointment would be welcomed by the international bankers. The trouble is
that the international bankers already approve of French economic policy;
what Mr Beregovoy lacks is the kind of charisma which would be likely to
excite ordinary French voters.
It is possible, therefore, that President Mitterrand may simply turn a deaf
ear to the clamour for a new government, and instead decide to soldier on
with Mrs Cresson.
But even then, he would need a strategy for avoiding a catastrophic defeat
in the general elections just over a year from now. It turns out that
Sunday's regional vote significantly overstates the degree of popular
disaffection with the Socialist Party; a poll conducted outside the voting
booths indicated that 22 per cent would vote socialist in a general
election.
Yet even that figure would imply a landslide for the conservatives, with 410
seats to the Socialists' 100-110.
But the main significance of Sunday's regional election was the operation of
proportional voting rules, which made possible the rise of the extreme
right-wing National Front and the two ecologist movements, at the expense of
all the traditional parties of government.
The Socialists took a hammering, but the conservative vote also suffered
serious erosion.
Inevitably, Sunday's vote has set up a renewed clamour of controversy over
the repercussions of proportional representation.
The conservatives have denounced PR as an iniquitous system, partly because
they believe it robbed them of votes on Sunday, but mainly because they fear
President Mitterrand will reintroduce it for general elections, to rob them
of votes next year.
Indeed, it is a fact that President Mitterrand has indicated a clear
inclination to move towards PR; but he has not said how far he wants to
move. Recent simulations suggest that only a fully proportional system would
prevent a conservative majority: they would get the most seats in
parliament, but critically short of an absolute majority.
Some people assume, therefore, that President Mitterrand will be determined
to go for full PR.
This could lead to serious conflict with leaders of the Socialist Party,
however. They say that they favour an element of PR, as a gesture to
potential allies in minority parties, like the ecologists; but they are
resisting full proportional representation, for fear that it should look too
much like bare-faced electoral engineering.
Sunday's popular rejection of the traditional parties of government no doubt
contained some element of gratuitous ill-temper.
The voters knew they could afford to express their general discontent,
because their vote would not automatically have specific policy
consequences.
But it is hard to deny the two most obvious lessons of the poll: after 12
years in power, the Socialists have probably out-stayed their welcome; and
as the alternative party of government, the conservatives arouse very little
enthusiasm indeed.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO PARTIES of similar political persuasion which can together capture a
combined 14 per cent of the votes in an election, putting them in third
place behind the other parties, might see merger as the sensible solution.
But, as anyone who watched Sunday night's television debate between the
heads of France's two ecology parties will be aware, there is no immediate
prospect of a merger between Mr Antoine Waechter's idealistic Greens and the
more pragmatic Generation Ecology, led by Mr Brice Lalonde, the environment
minister. During the debate an emotional Mr Lalonde repeated his
long-standing offer for the two parties to merge. Mr Waechter replied by
sternly shaking his head.
The ecologists' success was a salient feature of Sunday's poll. The Greens
secured 6.8 per cent of the votes and GE claimed 7.1 per cent. This meant
that, together, they were the third largest political force, with almost 14
per cent of the poll, just ahead of the National Front. Moreover the
ecologists' gains in particular regions - Alsace, Haute-Normandie,
Ile-de-France and Rhone-Alpes - should bolster their campaigning strength in
next year's national elections. At first glance the ecologists have made
significant progress since the 1989 European elections when the Greens, then
the only large environmentalist party, captured 10.6 per cent of the poll.
The underlying picture tells a different story of the Greens themselves
losing ground to the 15-month-old Generation Ecology. It goes a long way to
explaining why Mr Waechter is so strongly opposed to Mr Lalonde's overtures.
Until GE's emergence, the Greens, with their utopian agenda, were the
driving force in French environmentalism and a prime beneficiary of the
protest vote against the ruling Socialists. That role has now been usurped
by GE which, as one would expect from a party led by a government minister,
advocates a more pragmatic form of environmentalism working within the
existing political system.
Sunday's poll was the first real test of the relative power of the two
parties. Originally the Greens had hoped to cling on to a majority of the
ecology vote. Instead they were outstripped by GE.
Mr Lalonde has long argued that the two movements should merge.
So far Mr Waechter has argued against an alliance, although some factions of
his movement are known to be in favour.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Le Pen turns his protest vote into real influence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ONE eye of Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, leader of France's extreme right-wing
National Front, was yesterday glittering with satisfaction at the sight of
the first extensive regional power base his party has ever had.
For one of the less obvious but most important consequences of Sunday's
regional elections was to give the FN real influence, in some cases the
swing position, in most of the country's 22 regions. Formerly, Mr Le Pen's
people, with their loud anti-immigrant xenophobia, were seen as dangerous
outsiders in local politics.
Now, the FN has number two position in the three largest regions and
significant influence in five more, a solid country-wide base from which to
make its voice heard in the run-up to next year's general election. That
will be the real opportunity for the FN to make up for the main weakness in
its political weaponry; the fact that it holds just one seat in the 577-seat
National Assembly.
Nationwide, the FN did slightly less well than expected out of what was a
protest vote against the political establishment. The FN's 13.9 per cent
score on Sunday was a big advance on the 9.8 per cent it got in the last
regional poll in 1986, but miles behind Mr Le Pen's own claims that he would
get 20 per cent.
Notably, both Mr Le Pen and the wily Mr Bruno Megret, his number two and the
brains behind the FN's policies, suffered personal disappointments in the
key region of Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur, the FN's main battleground.
There, Mr Le Pen came second to the local conservative candidate in the
Alpes-Maritimes district, and Mr Megret came third in the Bouches du Rhone,
behind Mr Jean-Claude Gaudin, regional council president and the millionaire
Socialist supporter Mr Bernard Tapie.
Yet overall, the FN came out second in the Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur
region, with 34 of the 123 regional assembly seats, more than double its
previous representation. So the area's conservatives, with a relative
majority of just 43, cannot ignore Mr Le Pen in daily government.
The FN has even out-distanced the Socialists, to be number two behind the
conservatives, in the two largest regions, the Ile de France, which embraces
Paris, and Rhone-Alpes, whose regional capital is Lyons, France's second
city. It now holds similar positions in Alsace and Languedoc-Roussillon and
has made strong advances in Franche-Comte, Bourgogne and the Socialist
stronghold of Nord-Pas-de-Calais.
One reason why the FN's moderate score counts for so much is that the
regional election is by proportional representation, as against the
one-member constituency system that now applies to French general elections.
According to Sofres, the polling organisation, the FN would win 77
parliamentary seats if it repeated its weekend performance in a proportional
general election.
This calculation matters because the Socialist party might agree to
introduce an element of proportional voting for next year's poll, so as to
help the ecologists and other respectable alternatives.
Sunday's vote indicates just how much such a change would also benefit the
FN.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Ukraine plans to sever Russian economic links
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   KIEV
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UKRAINE's parliament meets in closed session today to consider an economic
programme that would cut links with Russia and rely on greater
self-sufficiency and financial discipline, writes Chrystia Freeland in Kiev.
The programme, a copy of which has been obtained by the Financial Times, is
the work of Mr Oleksandr Iemelianov, chief of the economic division of the
Duma, Ukraine's policy-making body.
His plan is characterised by overt hostility towards Russia, warning that
Ukraine's economic conflict with its northern neighbour 'threatens Ukraine's
very independence'. It was first unveiled to President Leonid Kravchuk last
Thursday, and may have fuelled the conflict between Ukraine and Russia at
the Commonwealth of Independent States summit the next day.
The parliament is expected to decide whether Ukraine opts for the
reactionary past, as advocated in the confidential programme, or makes the
radical move to the free market and liberal trade championed by Ukrainian
reformers.
Much will depend on Mr Kravchuk's position. To date, Mr Kravchuk, who
prefers compromise to confrontation, has carefully promoted both reformers
and conservatives in Ukraine's slow-motion cabinet shuffle. According to a
western adviser to Ukraine's government, the fiercely nationalist tone which
Mr Iemelianov and much of the leadership have adopted poses the threat of a
'national Communist' regime in Ukraine.
Mr Volodymyr Hryniov, deputy chairman of parliament and a leader of New
Ukraine, the liberal reformist alternative to the old guard, said: 'I will
oppose the programme . . . this direction is very dangerous.' He argues that
Ukraine's only salvation lies in outstripping the Russian pace of reform.
Mr Iemelianov's programme begins with the accurate assessment that Ukraine
lacks a coherent economic vision of its own and has been following Russia's
lead. He points to the damage Russia's breakneck emission of roubles has
done to the rouble-starved Ukrainian economy.
He proposes closing off the Ukrainian economy and 'a complete exit from the
rouble zone, and the immediate introduction of our own currency
simultaneously with Russian price liberalisation (scheduled for April 1)'.
Ukrainian reformers were the first to float the idea of a separate currency.
However, today they defer to World Bank and IMF experts, who have warned
them that introducing a separate currency before creating a functional
central bank and a detailed monetary reform plan would be a disaster. The
Ukrainian National Bank, whose chairman, Mr Volodymyr Matvienko, has long
been attacked for foot-dragging, is due for an overhaul today.

THE MAN WHO BROKE OUT OF THE BANK . . . by Miles Morland Bloomsbury Pounds
16.99, 216 pages
HERE IS my early (and not-too-serious) nomination for the best, by which I
mean the most enjoyable, 'Business Book' of 1992.
That may seem surprising, as it is not exactly an endorsement of the
challenges and satisfactions of the life of the international financier: on
the contrary, it is irresistible case for the wisdom of giving it all up.
Miles Morland had spent, as he puts it, 'Twenty-Two Years Shouting Down A
Phone'. After nine years on Wall Street he ran First Boston's brokerage
office in London. At 45 he was - well, not quite bored, but he knew he had
stopped learning. So he quit, and went off with his wife to walk across
France.
This is the story of The Walk, though the brief sequences in the City -
Rudloff, Von Klemm, etc - are fascinating (and funny) enough to make one
wish he would write at length about these things. (Says his 'rabbi' Luis in
New York when told of his resignation: 'You're not gonna work for those
fockers at Solly, are you?'. Before the Walk was over, Luis had quit too.)
'Non-City people think the satisfaction is in the money,' Morland says of
his professional life. 'They're wrong. Most of the pleasure comes from the
sheer competitive intensity of the work. But when I became successful in the
City, I had the same feeling I had had at Oxford or Radley as a successful
sportsman. I was wearing a suit that looked good, but hadn't it been made
for someone else?'
So at 45 he called a halt. 'Everyone else was secretly longing to do it
too.'
It is 350 miles from Mediterranean to Atlantic (Narbonne, Carcassonne, etc)
and Morland writes of provincial France better, more convincingly, less
sentimentally, than Peter Mayle. Having a half-French wife helps.
The hotels are more often grotty than charming, the natives are frequently
rude, the dogs are terrifying. Blisters, tendons, boots, showers, figure
prominently for this out-of-condition couple; ants, wasps and cockroaches
seem to feature on every page, as do many, many enthusiastically described
meals of (sometimes) wonderful food washed down with many a bottle.
It is agony and ecstasy in a mid-life crisis, set candidly in the context of
a marriage with a tricky past - they had divorced and remarried when he was
at the height of his career. Best of all, it is extremely funny, and the fun
never flags until they are paddling in the Atlantic. I foretell a rash of
resignations in EC2 in coming weeks.
'Do you miss it?' Guislaine asked.
'What do you think?'

clothing

<TEXT>
THE DEVIL'S CANDY by Julie Salamon Jonathan Cape Pounds 15.99, 423 pages
The Devil's Candy is subtitled The Bonfire Of The Vanities Goes To
Hollywood. Most famous novels that go to Hollywood never come back: or not
until they have been made into a glossy meld of stardust and hype in which
you need not bother to look for traces of the real Dostoevsky, Conrad or
Hemingway.
Tom Wolfe is none of these. But The Bonfire Of The Vanities, if not a great
novel, is a strongly defined one. The flames of its social and racial satire
are non-discriminating: they crackle through New York from the Bronx to the
Battery, pausing longest in Wall Street where they climb tall buildings to
find their stockbroker hero, Sherman McCoy, and pull him down like a burning
Icarus.
The cardinal crime of Brian De Palma's film of the novel, which on reaching
the screen crashed even more spectacularly than its hero (less Icarus, more
the Hindenburg), was to soften the original's ferocity. As Wall Street
Journal film critic Julie Salamon tells us in her engrossing story of the
production, Warner Brothers spent Dollars 50m dressing Wolfe in sheep's
clothing.
Yes, there is some generic, half-witted satire in Bruce Willis's picture of
the drunken, originally English tabloid reporter, Fallow. Yes, the
rabble-rousing black leader Reverend Bacon is allowed to sizzle a little
under De Palma's wide-angle lenses. But all that most filmgoers remember are
the over-lavish production values, the game but miscast Tom Hanks, and the
risible attempt at racial even-handedness in the transformation of the
novel's goodhearted deus ex machina Judge Kovitsky (Jewish) into the movie's
Judge White (black).
The heart-searching that produced this decision is one of the high points of
Salamon's chronicle. When Morgan Freeman stepped into the Judge's role to
deliver the cringe-making final speech fashioned by scriptwriter Michael
Cristofer - 'Decency is what your mother taught you' etc - The Bonfire Of
The Vanities finally consumed itself. Its flames, unlike the caustic ones
created by Wolfe, were the self-devouring ones of box-office opportunism.
Salamon's book may become a classic because its author, in addition to
writing well, has happened on a classic case history. Neither she nor the
film's makers could have foreseen that Bonfire would attract all the
night-flying, fabric-eating, spendthrift idiocies modern Hollywood is
capable of.
Hundreds of thousands of dollars were spent combing the North-Eastern states
to find the 'right' courtroom for Morgan Freeman. (Couldn't they have built
one?) More six- and seven-figure sums were spent on showy establishing
shots, like Concorde landing in a line with the setting sun; on providing
human support systems for 'difficult' stars such as Melanie Griffith; and on
 -but the list is as long, loud and unappeasable as Sherman McCoy's
dachsund.
Canine similes seem apt in a production which illuminates the besetting vice
of modern Hollywood. In thrall to the pseudoscience of audience market
research, the industry allows the tail to wag the dog.
For studios the far-off imaginary twitches of filmgoer response dictate the
choreographing of the movie's own gestures and movements in production.
Given the responsibility of a big-budget film on which he was shadowed by
Warner executives at every step, even a film-maker like Brian De Palma
succumbs to the prognosticatory anxiety. Indeed it was De Palma, Salomon
tells us, who cast Morgan Freeman as the Judge. Aim: to sweeten the film's
eventual appeal to black and liberal filmgoers.
Nothing is more quietly horrific in Julie Salamon's book than the final
fever of sneak previews. A film that might once have had a unified vision,
back when De Palma first read the novel, is shredded and re-edited in the
weeks before its Christmas 1990 release on the say-so of a few thousand
preview cards. The monosyllabic 'liked' and 'didn't like' verdicts of
moviegoers in middle Texas or outer Wyoming are allowed to reshape an entire
film.
One cannot make good art like this; one cannot even be sure of making good
entertainment. But Warners will no doubt have learned this itself after its
Bonfire finger-burning. As Salamon mischievously notes, a month before De
Palma's folie de grandeur opened, a low-budget, low-expectation comedy
called Home Alone opened in America and began its climb to become the third
most successful film in history. It was produced by 20th Century Fox after
Warner Bros, its initial producers, passed on the project.

RISING SUN by Michael Crichton Knopf Dollars 22, 355 pages (UK publi cation
in June, Century Pounds 14.99)
ONE DOES not need to read very far into this techno-thriller before
encountering the first of numerous Japan-bashing remarks made by the book's
protagonists. By page 19 the reader is treated to a lecture on how the
nefarious Japanese are penetrating the heart of the US economic and
political systems: 'S***,' says a character, 'we're giving this country
away.'
Rising Sun may be a well-written thriller, but it is also an unpleasant
novel, full of near-racist slurs, exaggerations and, at times, pure
protectionist bunk. This is a book that panders to the worst of
anti-Japanese sentiment, which is perhaps why it is already a best-seller in
America.
On one level it is a mystery that follows two Los Angeles detectives as they
solve the murder of a beautiful young prostitute who is found strangled at a
lavish party given by Nakomoyo, the fictional Japanese company.
Fans of Michael Crichton, whose previous books include The Andromeda Strain
and Jurassic Park, will find all of the author's trademark best-selling
techniques - the fast-moving plot, the paper-thin character development, the
well-researched technical detail and such.
But the significance of this book, which given the current mood of America
seems destined to be one of the bigger best-selling US novels of the year,
lies not in the plot itself so much as in the constant vitriol that is
poured over the Japanese culture and Japanese business establishment.
Crichton would presumably deny that he is in any way racist and would
suggest that he is merely trying to address an issue of current public
interest - but the book is filled with the kind of low-brow and
crypto-racist sloganeering one hears from right-wing Republican presidential
candidates such as Patrick Buchanan and David Duke. 'We are at war with
Japan,' says a US Senator in the novel, who then proceeds to quote
colleagues who say 'sooner or later we're going to have to drop another
bomb.'
'So the Japanese dumped steel, televisions, consumer electronics, computer
chips, machine tools - and nobody stopped them. And we lost those
industries. Japanese companies and the Japanese government target specific
industries, which they take over. Industry after industry, year after year,'
says another character.
Rising Sun's message is blunt, and seemingly well researched. And it clearly
is striking a chord with many American readers. But the book is essentially
a pamphlet, a call to arms against the Japanese financial invasion of
America.

WHAT consequences will the Single European Market have for business? It will
change the world, say the believers. Nonsense, retort the sceptics, the
Single Market will have no substantial consequences at all. Which opinion
should you trust?
Do not trust either. Examine your own situation and decide for yourself. The
answer depends on several factors: the size of your company, the
geographical area, the industrial or commercial sector, your time horizon,
and so on. To make all this simpler, Ceres and Durham University Business
School have produced the peculiarly-named EuroTrain (ring-bound, A4, two
volumes, approx 130 pages, Pounds 70) which sets out to be a tool-kit for
developing your own European strategy.
EuroTrain aspires to integrate all the details of the various Single Market
measures into a single, logical format so that their impact on a particular
business can be evaluated systematically and comprehensively. At least, that
is the aim of the first volume; the points in it which are blindingly
obvious to me are probably not quite so obvious to others, and vice versa,
no doubt. In any case, publishers are more likely to go wrong by skipping
what seems obvious than they are by including some matters which may appear
elementary.
The second volume provides names and addresses of all the organisations
which are mentioned in the first volume. The value of this is somewhat
dubious, partly because several of the organisations listed would be unable
to provide you with anything particularly enlightening, and partly because
several organisations which could provide relevant information are excluded.
But, even by itself, Volume 1 is good value for money if it is going to help
you decide on a matter as important as your European strategy.
                           *       *      *
Wouldn't it be lovely if we could entrust all of life's little decisions to
a computer? We are not quite there yet, but there are a growing number of
software packages which help simplify, segment and clarify, decision-making.
The latest of these is Strad, specifically designed for the PC. Planning in
the face of multiple uncertainty, under the pressure of fast-moving events,
calls for a particular kind of cool thinking, a special kind of
rational-cum-insightful analysis, which can be helped by the way in which
computers handle issues.
Strad sees the central challenges as managing of the different sources of
uncertainty and balancing commitment in the short term with flexibility in
the future.
The instructions which come with the software are sometimes a little
difficult to follow, and the ins and outs of the system force one to think
quite carefully about the problem in hand. But, once mastered, the system
makes decisions markedly less fraught and more thoroughly considered.
                           *       *      *
Precisely what makes decision-making fraught - that is, the rapidity and
complexity of change - is what makes organisational renewal so necessary.
Rosabeth Moss Kanter has made her name as a management guru specialising in
the management of change, and some of her latest thinking is captured in The
Great Balancing Act (BBC Training Videos, set of two videos, with Training
Notes, Pounds 299 plus VAT).
The average life-span of an organisation - 40 years - is less than the
average life-span of a human being, and Kanter basic message is that, if
organisations wish to survive, they need to become faster, more focused,
more flexible and more friendly.
One of the factors which can make an organisation quicker is a move away
from the traditional job description-ruled hierarchy to flatter,
project-oriented teams which form and re-form as need arises or passes.
This calls for transformation, not just of structures but more crucially of
the mentality of individuals.
While hierarchical management is control-orientation project leadership is
oriented towards liberation, teamwork and shared achievement.
To assist with this individual transformation, you may wish to try Daedal's
The Project, another of its paper maze-exercises (ring-bound, A4, with OHP
masters, and handout masters, Pounds 125) which is designed to help people,
up to middle management levels, to succeed as project leaders.
Unfortunately, there is little aimed at more senior people even though
businesses can only grow to the level of their chief executives, and unless
these executives keep learning there is little chance for the organisation
to keep growing.

FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (24): What makes a self-made
man - The search for the secret of entrepreneurial success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST AS the alchemists in the Middle Ages sought for the formula for turning
base metal into gold, so researchers in more recent times have attempted to
distil the essence of the entrepreneur.
What is it that distinguishes the self-made man from his counterpart who is
quite happy to spend his working life in the employ of others? What prompts
some managers to leave well-paid jobs in large corporations to set up in
business on their own or to stage a management buy-out?
The business tycoon has always fascinated readers, as the newspaper column
inches and the yards of bookshelf devoted to men such as Robert Maxwell,
'Tiny' Rowland and Richard Branson testify. But the past decade and a half
has seen a more serious interest develop as the important economic role of
small businesses - and the men and women who run them - has become better
appreciated. If we can understand what makes the entrepreneur tick,
governments may be able to devise policies to encourage enterprise.
Four recent books each examine different aspects of the entrepreneurial
psyche and the world in which entrepreneurs operate. For the policy-maker
there is a discouraging inconclusiveness to their findings.
Entrepreneur] by Tom Lloyd (Bloomsbury Pounds 9.99, 176 pages) promises
insights into the entrepreneurial mind but fails to deliver. Lloyd takes the
life stories of eight entrepreneurs as the basis for his book but then
perversely chops them into sections which fit his chapter headings,
weakening the narrative effect.
Some of the entrepreneurs chosen, such as Bob Payton, the pizza potentate,
and global marketeer Martin Sorrell, will be familiar to many readers but
Lloyd does the debate a service by broadening his definition to include
Jenny Pitman, a leading racehorse trainer, and Richard Noble, holder of the
world land speed record.
Puzzlingly, the author says his aim is to tell us about the entrepreneur as
a 'human being living in the ordinary world', though most of us want to know
what makes entrepreneurs different. On this score the book is disappointing.
It points to the entrepreneur as having a positive outlook, a different
vision system and a love of change. Newcomers to the subject of enterprise
may find Entrepreneur] a readable basic introduction but must look for more
probing approach elsewhere.
The Naked Entrepreneur (Kogan Page Pounds 14.95/Pounds 7.99, 122 pages)
attempts a more substantial analysis and seeks to paint a picture of the
entrepreneur stripped of what the author, David Robinson, calls 'the
self-seeking promotion of the gossip columns.'
But Robinson's conclusion that the entrepreneur is 'dedicated to the pursuit
of wealth and power' differs from that of many other studies which have
stressed that money is not a prime motivator. His study also suffers from a
lack of real case histories. He draws on his experience as an accountant for
his analysis but, being unwilling to use identifiable examples of clients,
opts for 'composites' of real people he has known to illustrate his
arguments.
Like so many other studies of the entrepreneur this one notes that much of
the evidence on the motivation of entrepreneurs is conflicting, but
concludes they possess in accentuated form common character traits such as
imagination and dedication.
One advantage of creating 'composite' entrepreneurs is that the author
avoids any sexual bias, but most books devoted to enterprise suggest it is a
largely male activity. However, as Women as Entrepreneurs (Academic Press
Pounds 24.95, 172 pages) points out, male self-employment rose by only 30
per cent in Britain during the 1980s while female self-employment rose 70
per cent. This soberly academic book by Sara Carter and Tom Cannon studies
the problems confronting this largely unacknowledged army of women
entrepreneurs.
It examines the proposition that women face problems, some of which are in
addition to, or different from, those met by men in starting up and running
a business. In spite of the detail of the argument the reader is left with
the feeling that the similarities are greater than the differences.
The Carter/Cannon study identifies five types of female entrepreneur ranging
from the youngish, frustrated career woman to the older returner who has
raised a family. The successful ones have in common a high degree of formal
education and a willingness to train to fill the gaps in their business
skills. In contrast to Robinson's conclusion that money is an important
motivator, Carter and Cannon find women judge success in personal rather
than commercial terms, at least in the early stages of their entrepreneurial
careers.
Entrepreneurs in High Technology (Oxford-New York Dollars 27.95, 386 pages)
looks at a very different sample of entrepreneurs but comes to remarkably
similar conclusions about motivation.
Most company founders are strongly driven by a desire for independence but
are only moderately interested in financial rewards when they start, says
Edward B. Roberts, professor of technology management at the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology (MIT).
Roberts' entrepreneurs form an elite group, largely comprising former
students and academics from MIT who set up business in the technological
hot-house formed by companies on Boston's Route 128. For all the depth of
his research over 25 years into hundreds of high tech businesses, he is
forced to conclude that success cannot be predicted from personal charac-
teristics.
He does, however, identify pointers to success among his closely defined
target group. A background of work on applied development rather than pure
research is a considerable help and the entrepreneur must be able to
transfer a considerable amount of technological knowledge from his former
employer when starting up on his own.
So, what makes an entrepreneur? And what allows some to succeed and others
to fail? The diversity of the men and women portrayed in these studies makes
for no easy conclusions. Nature and nurture both play a part, but then so
does a bewildering array of other external factors. The origins of the
entrepreneurial spark remain elusive.

LEADERSHIP AND THE COMPUTER by Mary E Boone Prima Publishing Dollars 24.95,
397 pages
AUTHOR Mary E Boone was about to speak at an executive breakfast meeting in
Albuquerque. As the clatter of knives and plates died down the person
introducing her said: 'Ms Boone will talk to us today about executive
computing, a term many of us have long considered to be an oxymoron - sort
of like airline cuisine.'
Almost all surveys of senior managers show that they feel intimidated by
personal computers. Some PCs gracing executive desktops are only there for
show. Those that are switched on are often used as little more than
glorified typewriters.
Boone, a specialist on executive use of information systems and a partner in
a Connecticut management consultancy, sets out to expose the myths and
realities about executive computing and to argue that a desktop PC can give
a chief executive a competitive edge.
Her book is built around interviews with 16 senior US executives who use
PCs, exploring what they use them for and how computers help them.
Among those profiled are Burnell Roberts of Mead Corporation, who consults a
worldwide corporate contact database before leaving town; Thomas Plaskett,
who used a word processor to try and improve morale at Pan Am, the (now
defunct) airline; and Debbi Fields, who devised an expert system to help
employees make key decisions at her 600-plus Mrs Field's Cookies shops.
'Without (my computer), I don't know how I'd function . . . I'd feel totally
disconnected,' Field says.
The book suggests that computers can help executives in six basic areas:
leveraging time, communicating, coaching, staying well informed, enhancing
personal thinking, and shaping corporate culture.
If these executives consider computers so critical, why do more not use
them? 'Myths abound as to why executives are reluctant to personally use
computers,' says the author. Common misconceptions are that executives will
not type, or that adequate support staff makes computers unnecessary. 'But
the real reason executives don't use computers,' says Boone, 'is that 99 per
cent of top executives simply do not know what computers can do for them
personally. They have no idea of the power of the computer as a leadership
tool.'
In spite of their enthusiasm, most of her interviewees seem to be using
their desktops for fairly basic tasks: electronic mail, letter and speech
writing, building internal databases and contact lists, tapping into and
monitoring corporate financial data, pondering What If? scenarios on a
spreadsheet and checking spelling.
The book is readable and the interviews which make up the first half are
mostly interesting. The second half is analytical. This is a book about
management rather than computers - physical hardware is hardly mentioned.
Above all it is a book with a mission to persuade, and the author is
refreshingly honest about that.

FRONTIERS OF LEADERSHIP by M Syrett and C Hogg Blackwell Pounds 45/Pounds
22.50, 600 pages
MANAGERS are always keen to learn more about leadership. They believe it
offers them the promise of greater personal success and perhaps enhanced
organisational effectiveness. This belief is itself sustained by a business
press which often focuses on the contribution that particular individuals
make to successful enterprises. The shelves of business bookshops groan with
manuals telling you how to become more like Lee Iacocca, John Harvey-Jones
or other business leaders.
Whether this obsession with successful individuals is really connected with
organisational effectiveness usually remains untested. Here at least is a
book laced with a healthy scepticism about leaders and the effects they can
have which at the same time recognises the importance of leadership to
organisations large and small, not least to the individuals inside them.
It attempts to bring together a variety of approaches to a series of core
questions: What do leaders do? Whatever it is, can it be learnt or
developed? How can we recognise those with leadership potential? The
contributors come from academia, consultancy, journalism and business, which
inevitably means that the collection is varied in style ranging from fairly
academic scholarly papers to semi-autobiographical insider accounts from
such as Jan Carlzon and Michael Edwardes.
It must also be said that the quality of the contributions varies
considerably. There are stimulating, even provocative pieces from Charles
Handy, John Harvey-Jones and Rosabeth Moss Kanter. In contrast, the entire
section on leadership and creativity includes essays far too brief to
develop any sustained argument or offer much practical advice. This is
partly the responsibility of the editors who have pared some contributions
too near to the bone.
What does the book offer as insights into the often muddied water of
distinguishing leadership from management? Kotter argues that we must think
of these as two distinctive, yet complementary, kinds of activity. One,
management, is essentially about coping with complexity, the other,
leadership, is about setting a direction, or building a vision. The former
uses a battery of administrative measures, - planning and budgeting,
controlling and organising - while the latter is concerned with motivating,
empowering and gaining commitment.
Clearly, organisations need both kinds of activity and we should be cautious
not to be seduced by leadership and forget the less glamorous but equally
important activities of management.
This argument may offer comfort to those inside organisations who feel the
personal risks of becoming a leader are not for them. At the same time
potential leaders are encouraged to develop and communicate their vision for
the organisation or for their part of it.
If this particular description of what leaders do convinces, what can we do
to develop such behaviour? Part II of this book deals with a series of
issues around developing leaders and placing them effectively within
organisations.
Conger's paper argues convincingly that qualities of leadership do not
spring from a set of intricate characteristics. Rather, organisations can
create processes which develop and nurture potential leaders, or they can
act to discourage or even punish those who could lead effectively.
Organisations which stifle creativity, punish dissent and drain enthusiasm
drive leadership out of the system while those that welcome unconventional
thinking and a willingness to take risks encourage it.
If Conger is right, then internal processes of management development are
critical for future success. Gratton usefully summarises current practices
and trends in identifying high-potential individuals. However, the whole
philosophy of 'fast-tracking' particular individuals is subject to withering
criticism from Wendy Hirsh, who argues that such processes are usually
unsuccessful and act as a demonstration for those not selected for the
fast-track.
An interesting alternative to this notion of a leadership cadre is explored
in the contributions dealing with organisational learning. Charles
Hampden-Turner and Bob Garratt are both persuasive in suggesting that it is
the individuals and organisations who possess the possibility of continuous
learning that are most likely to survive and prosper in a dynamic business
environment and that visionary leaders 'stuck' in one mode of thinking are
more of a problem than an asset.
This book may thus prove useful for those intrinsically interested in
conceptions of leadership and for those professionally concerned with
managerial and leadership development. A number of doubts remain. We still
need evidence about leadership effectiveness and we need an explanation of
why we seem so obsessed by the subject. Its attraction my be a dangerous
seduction.
Finally, the reader is not helped by the construction of the book. There is
no bibliography, not even suggested further reading; some papers contain
incomplete references which makes it difficult to follow-up interesting
ideas; and there is no description of several of the contributors.
Nevertheless, the lure of understanding leadership will take this book on to
many bookshelves.

RAILROADS TRIUMPHANT by Albro Martin Oxford Pounds 25, 442 pages
I FEAR that Professor Martin and his distinguished publishers are guilty of
switch-selling, offering us one product and providing another.
In his Preface, Professor Martin claims that he was once introduced at a
conference as the man who made deregulation academically respectable. This
claim was based on an earlier book, Enterprise Denied, Origins of the
Decline of the American Railroad. So he should have been the ideal author
for a book answering the question he poses in the Preface, one of the most
fascinating and under-explored aspects of the social, economic and political
history of the US over the past 150 years: how did it come about that the
railroads, so crucial in creating, developing and binding together such a
disparate land-mass, were despised and rejected by a politically contentious
people who made them the scapegoat of their discontents?
Unfortunately Martin makes only the most token attempts to answer any of
these questions. Instead he gives us a fascinating, deeply personal, albeit
rambling and ill-organised, panoramic view of American railroads, from July
4 1828, the day Charles Carroll, last surviving signatory of the Declaration
of Independence, turned the first spade of earth for the first railroad in
the country, up to the present day, ten years after the century-old shackles
on the railroads operations had been removed by the Staggers Act of 1981 - a
long-overdue piece of legislation barely glanced at in this infuriating
book.
In fact the railroads had asked for trouble by their arrogance and greed.
The first warnings came as early as the 1870s with the Granger movement, a
radical rural revolt in the Mid-West by farmers angry at the excessive
prices they had to pay to get their grain to market (needless to say, Martin
has nothing to say about this crucial uprising).
Inevitably railroads were the first American industry to be regulated
('shackled', Professor Martin would say, but then the concept that they
could ever have abused their power never seems to have occurred to him).
They suffered further restrictions as a result of two world wars, whose
regulatory effects lasted far longer than the conflicts which triggered
them.
But - and this is the central political mystery of the subject - the
restrictions, particularly on long-overdue amalgamations, remained in force
long after the railroads had been reduced to impotence as a competitive
force; by the end of the 1970s trains were averaging just 12mph because of
the appalling state of the infrastructure.
Then, as a political scientist once put it, 'the American people found the
right solution after they had tried all the others', and since deregulation
the railways have been able to start repairing the neglect of generations
through amalgamations (and the hiving-off of shorter lines).
The come-back has a long way to go: the railroads are still struggling
against crippling work practices imposed by unions long ago in response to
the same abuse of power which created the original regulatory framework; and
tracks suitable for ultra-heavy freight trains are unsuited to fast
passenger traffic.
But there are numerous plans for improvements or new lines for passenger
trains on numerous routes - such as the North-Eastern Corridor from Boston
to Washington via New York, Dallas-Houston etc - where trains travelling up
to 200mph can compete with aeroplane and car. But perhaps we should not
expect the Prof. to bother with such details.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN is the second largest and one of the least understood economies in the
world. To explain how its scandal-ridden financial sector can continue to
finance the fastest growing industrial sector in the developed world
requires more than a partial knowledge of its institutions. Takatoshi Ito's
book (The Japanese Economy, MIT, Pounds 35.95) provides a worthwhile first
step.
The book gives an introduction to market economics, Japanese-style, starting
with a history of the Tokugawa era of isolationism, the Meiji restoration
and post-war drive for growth.
Monetary, fiscal and industrial policies all merit chapters while the
peculiar nature of the Japanese labour market is adequately covered. The
book concludes with a discussion of US-Japan economic conflicts; the retail
distribution system and import barriers; and asset prices and the stock
market boom-bust cycle. undergraduates, confused executives and bemused US
congressmen would all learn from this book.

THE CORPORATE BOARD: CONFRONTINGTHE PARADOXES by Ada Demb and F Friedrich
Neubauer Oxford Pounds 27.50, 224 pages
CORPORATE governance is continually in the news today with business
scandals, company failures and legal battles involving large banks,
institutional shareholders, auditors, and with directors in the dock.
The need for reform is evident. As Ada Demb and Friedrich Neubauer say in
The Corporate Board: 'We need to bring the mechanisms for corporate
governance into line with current business reality.' As is clear from the
difficulties which the regulators and auditors are having with their
investigations of BCCI and the Maxwell empire, the scale and complexity of
business activity has outrun the existing control mechanisms.
In 1989 the world's ten largest companies taken together employed 4m people.
Their combined sales were equal to the GDP of the four Scandinavian
countries, or Canada. Businesses today rival governments in their ability to
create and distribute wealth. This puts enormous power into the hands of the
'government' of these companies - the 200 or so people who make up the
boards of directors of these ten companies  - a few people with an ambiguous
mandate, and a narrowly based 'electorate.'
Ada Demb and Friedrich Neubauer consider the problem of 'governance' not in
terms of mechanisms: the size and structure of boards, the use of audit and
remuneration committees, or relations with auditors and institutional
shareholders. Rather, the authors set out to provide a chairman or chief
executive with a set of 'diagnostic tools'.
Their frameworks are useful. They argue that 'much of the expressed
dissatisfaction with boards is, in reality, a dissatisfaction with the
performance of our entire governance system', therefore we should not focus
our attention just on board structures. Directors should also be assessing
the regulatory system, relationships with owners, and social pressures.
The authors suggest that developing a strong board is like building a
bridge. There is no universal design which will fit every case. It is a
matter of balancing the opposing forces and stresses to suit a particular
situation.
In a board there are three main sources of tension: (1) management autonomy
versus board control; (2) commitment and involvement versus detachment and
objectivity; (3) good teamwork versus the judgment and initiative of
individuals
The authors have achieved a breakthrough in management research. It is, I
believe, the first time researchers have been permitted to interview the
main board directors of large international corporations about the way they
run their boards. They questioned 72 directors of 11 large corporations in
eight countries, mostly in Europe, but also in Canada and Venezuela.
The data they have produced comes from the widest possible range of
directors: from two-tier boards and unitary boards, state-owned companies as
well as private businesses; even a couple of employee directors were
included. Surprisingly, they found that regardless of the board structure or
the industry, all the directors faced the same kinds of problems.
The price the authors had to pay for access to these directors was total
confidentiality. From the readers' point of view this is a serious drawback.
There are no company names - no case studies (not even in disguise), no
information about the organisation's size, structure, product/market
situation or performance - except that in general their performance was
'above average'. Nevertheless, the book has an air of reality because the
argument is illustrated throughout by quotations from the directors who were
interviewed.
The 'bottom line' of the book is the need for board assessments. To quote
Sir John Harvey-Jones: 'unless a board continuously criticises the way it is
working it is extraordinarily difficult for it to improve its performance'.
Even in the large corporations which the authors visited this practice was
not established, except in a few cases on an informal basis.
In the current debate about corporate governance, board assessments is
becoming a hot topic. The Working Group on Corporate Governance, a group of
distinguished lawyers representing large US companies and institutional
investors, recently recommended regular and comprehensive appraisals of
boards and individual directors by outside directors, and by institutional
shareholders.
Also, in 1990 the British Institute of Directors published a report ('The
Effective Board' by Colin Coulson-Thomas and Alan Wakelam) which recommended
that the chairman should require the board to undertake an 'annual review'
of its collective performance and the personal effectiveness of each
director. If this idea takes off, it will provide an important role for
non-executive directors, and management consultants.

MAVERICK, THE LIFE OF A UNION REBEL by Eric Hammond and Christopher Leake
Weidenfield and Nicholson, Pounds 16.99, 214 pages
AT A TIME when most trade union leaders struggled to be heard amid a hostile
political environment, Eric Hammond encountered few such difficulties. When
he stepped down this month as general secretary of the EETPU electricians
after eight years, trade unions lost one of their most notorious, and
arguably one of their most effective, leaders.
Notorious because he challenged traditional views of what unions should do
and incurred the wrath of colleagues in other unions as a result. Effective
because his union suffered less than others in membership losses and he
retained the loyalty of his members even though he led them out of the
Trades Union Congress and the union mainstream.
In his autobiography, he is typically unrepentant. Indeed, he inflames his
opponents further by revealing details of secret talks held with News
International a year before it moved its newspaper printing operations to
Wapping in 1985. The talks, albeit on recognition at a planned publication
rather than existing ones, contributed towards several thousand print union
workers losing their jobs.
Hammond, never one to undersell himself, clearly has his eyes on a wider
readership than that which could normally be expected of a union leader's
autobiography. Written in collaboration with Christopher Leake, industrial
editor of The Mail on Sunday, the style is succinct and rich in anecdotes.
Among these Hammond records a confrontation at 10 Downing Street with Lord
Weinstock, GEC chief executive. The row, over whether Hammond was
responsible for frustrating a 1970s nuclear programme, ended with Hammond
asking Weinstock if he ever asked himself whether he might be wrong.
According to Hammond: 'Weinstock paused briefly and then said, with all the
vehemence I have experienced from my many enemies in the TUC: 'Yes, I was
wrong. I didn't have you shot.' There was no smile.'
The book is also readable because Hammond has a story to tell. In ten
chapters, the book uses five to chart the EETPU's and Hammond's differences
with other unions over: the pits strike of 1984-5; union acceptance of
government cash for ballots; News International; no-strike deals; and Labour
party policy.
In these rows Hammond sustained himself with his belief, bordering on
arrogance, in his intellectual rectitude. If he had doubts about his talks
with Murdoch, he does not express them. The blame is placed firmly on the
shoulders of print union leaders for their '19th century' intransigence in
talks with Murdoch and for leading their members 'like lemmings over the
precipice.'
But in his adversities Hammond's state of mind - though not necessarily his
cause - was also helped by his delight in verbal fighting and his sense of
theatre. On the few occasions where he expresses regret it is usually to
lament that he was deprived of the dramatic effect he had expected.
In one passage he discusses his last speech to the TUC, in the debate prior
EETPU's 1988 expulsion for failing to implement TUC rulings on inter-union
rows. 'For the first time in years, I was able to make a speech without
constant interruption. Norman (Willis, TUC general secretary) had issued
orders the previous evening that there was to be no heckling. I tried
desperately to bait them, but much to my chagrin it did not work.'
The overall impression Hammond tries to give is that he faced up to reality
faster than other union leaders over issues such as government cash for
ballots and single union deals. Of his struggles in the Labour party, he
writes: 'From being the odd man out all those years ago, (a reference to a
row over ceremonial dress while a Labour councillor) I now feel like the odd
man in. After all, they have all followed by lead.'
Unions and Labour have indeed altered their policies. But what changed them
was Thatcher and the Conservative party; Hammond's role was insignificant by
comparison and he may even have slowed the process because of his
antagonistic stances. And it is difficult to imagine any other union leader
emulating Hammond's actions during the News International controversies.

THE NEW CORPORATE FRONTIER by David Heenan McGraw-Hill Pounds 15.95, 262
pages
IN 1960, New York was home to the head offices of 130 out of the US's 500
biggest companies: by 1990 the number had shrunk to 43. Over the same period
most other large US cities saw a similar reduction, a sign of the flight to
the countryside of US business.
Shifts in organisation have played a part. Much of the west's industry
depends far less today than in the 1960s on large pools of manual labour.
That means they can relatively easily set up in under-populated regions.
Also, the entrepreneurs who were responsible for much of the 1980s economic
boom in the US often preferred the space and freedom of rural areas. Hence
many relatively new US companies are based in out-of-the-way places such as
Portland or Boise, rather than in Chicago or Pittsburgh.
In documenting this corporate shift, Heenan provides plenty of examples of
how the relatively informal 'small town' ethos of the countryside-based
companies can help their general business approach, such as through
non-hierachial management structures and good relations with the local
population.
But the descriptions of the 'frontier' companies - they include Cummins
Engines, the Wal-Mart store chain and an ice-cream maker called Ben &amp;
Jerry's - lack depth. And while one chapter is devoted to the pitfalls of
setting up in the countrywide - such as how to attract to live in these
regions the lively, young professionals who often like the spice of big-city
life - too much of the book reads like an advert for the companies
concerned.
A final point is that the research for the book was done mainly in the mid
to late 1980s. It would be interesting to know how many of the companies
listed (most of which are lauded for doing amazingly well commercially) are
coping with recession.

TO THE END OF TIME by Richard Clurman Simon &amp; Schuster Dollars 23. 368 pages
IT WAS one of the most curious marriages of the 1980s takeover wave - a
little like a wedding between a prim New England intellectual and a
hedonistic Californian rock star.
On the one side was Time Inc, the world's largest magazine and book
publisher, and inheritor of the stern didacticism of Henry Luce, who built a
great journalistic empire on a mission to inform the American public. Its
top management ranks were filled with White Anglo Saxon Protestants who had
been carved into shape by the right East coast schools.
On the other was Warner Communications, a popular entertainment giant with
interests ranging from films to rock records which had been built, says
author Richard Clurman, on two primary business objectives: 'making money
and having a good time doing it.'
Steve Ross, its creator and chairman, had come a long, long way from his
beginnings as the director of a New York funeral parlour, and in the process
become one of America's most controversial businessmen: his pay was
colossal, his business background was chequered and a little murky, but his
unctuous manner charmed everyone.
'Steve,' one long-time rival is quoted as saying, 'has this uncanny quality
of making you feel sorry for him even when you think he's screwing you.'
The basic thesis advanced by Clurman, a former chief of correspondents for
Time, is that Ross well and truly screwed Time's management, seducing them
into what was supposed to be a merger of equals which preserved the precious
Time culture, on terms which brought Warner out comfortably on top. Both
sets of managements were encouraged in their deal-making by compensation
packages of extraordinary generosity, with Ross himself netting more than
Dollars 200m (Pounds 113.6m).
Certainly, the dominance of Warner in the conjoined culture was graphically
underlined last month when Nicholas Nicholas, the senior manager from the
Time side, was forced to step down as co-chief executive and heir apparent
to Ross. He was replaced by Jerry Levin, another Time alumni, but a man
closer to Ross and, reputedly, with a better feel for the film business.
It is hard to argue with Clurman's contention that Ross ran rings round
Time's management, which had floundered throughout the 1980s in search of a
successful business strategy. Their existing magazines were in mature
markets and their efforts to establish new ones all aborted, mostly notably
the embarrassing TV-Cable Week, an instant dud.
Time owned a cable television channel, Home Box Office, which Levin had
built up in the 1970s. As the management flailed about in search of a
strategic home-run, a succession of consultants suggested that the future
lay somehow in video.
Clurman does a workmanlike job of describing Time's search for a partner,
its selection of Warner and the ensuing three-way battle when entertainment
group Paramount launched a counter-bid for Time.
But the book provides few original insights into Ross's background and
personality, or his business record. And it is superficial and patchy in its
analysis of the commercial and technological rationale that was supposed to
underlie the creation of the world's biggest media company: the convergence
of printed and video images in a single medium wired into the home.
This entertainment smorgasbord is almost certainly coming, but its economics
remain uncertain. So too does the rationale for having its software
providers (publishing, film and record businesses) under the same roof, not
to mention the conduit for the information (cable operators like Time
Warner) or hardware companies (such as electronics group Toshiba, which
plans to take a stake in Time Warner's film and cable business).
The rationale for the merger, then, remains unproven. And its first two
years have also thrown up a succession of management misjudgments which have
raised eyebrows on Wall Street, notably an ill-conceived share issue aimed
at reducing the mountain of debt which the merger piled on top of the
business.
The tone throughout Clurman's book suggests that the merger was bad for
Time, not merely in financial terms but in the destruction of Henry Luce's
tradition, with its mission to inform and its clear distinction between
'church' (its journalists) and 'state' (its management). Yet, while quoting
senior Time executives as being 'apprehensive,' Clurman advances precious
little evidence of direct interference in editorial policies, and
acknowledges that many within the organisation have been pleasantly
surprised by Ross.
At the same time, he suggests that there is increasing pressure by the
group's management to take Time down-market to increase its sagging
circulation. 'It was obvious,' he quotes one editor as saying, 'that the
business guys thought we were a bunch of nerds, policy-makers, putting out a
pseudo-intellectual magazine about world affairs full of what they call
'homework.''
The charge remains unproven, and Time Warner executives insist that the
prestige of its magazines business is central to the group's being. But in a
nation whose television is already among the worst in the Western world, and
where educational standards are falling, the Luce tradition may simply be a
worthy anachronism.

WOLFF'S GUIDE TO THE LONDON METAL EXCHANGE (4th. edition) Metal Bulletin
Books Pounds 44 (Dollars 88), 269 pages
THE TIN MEN by Ralph Kestenbaum Metal Bulletin Books Pounds 25, 316 pages
THE latest edition of Wolff's Guide, edited by former FT Commodities Editor
John Edwards, is renewed testimony to the long-standing, hand-in-glove
relationship between the London Metal Exchange (LME) and Rudolf Wolff &amp; Co.,
one of its founder members in 1876 and now one of the elder statesmen of the
metal-broking fraternity.
Different chapters by various contributors cover in detail the LME's history
from its early days in City coffee houses, how metal trading is conducted,
the theory and practice of hedging, traded options, chart analysis, and the
six metals traded on the exchange. Appendices list LME members, brands of
deliverable metal, locations of LME warehouses and contract specifications.
An index might have been useful, although the publishers might justifiably
argue that the contents are so well arranged that the reader can find his
way around without an index.
A more obvious omission, particularly from the many worked examples of
trading strategies, is any meaningful reference to dealing costs. How can
one be sure that a complicated hedging programme will not cost more in
commission than it is worth in trading gains?
Of the 22 chapters in this edition, eight are new and several others have
had to be revised since the previous edition in 1988.
Trading on the LME has changed in several respects since then, with the
advent of traded options, settlement in a choice of currencies, worldwide
points of delivery and a trading 'horizon' extended from three to 27 months
forward.
Furthermore, the LME has had to restructure itself in the wake of both the
1985 tin market crisis and the 1986 Financial Services Act, both for its own
protection and to redefine the relationship between its brokers and their
clients.
The concept of investor protection now extends to speculators and even trade
hedgers on commodity markets, and the LME's clearing house, which guarantees
the execution of every contract, ensures that brokers are protected as much
from each other as from their clients.
A consistent theme running through the book is the LMF, as the embodiment of
irresistible free market forces, prevailing over the evils of price
manipulation by both metal producers and speculators.
This market is the dog which, unlike others, no cartelised or speculative
tail can wag. It is the perfect hedging medium because it discovers the
definitive free market price - because it is the perfect hedging medium.
Ralph Kestenbaum's The Tin Men is a long overdue account of the most famous
recent attempt to use the LME to rig a market. Kestenbaum, who led the LME
brokers in their claims for redress from the International Tin Council
(ITC), is particularly well placed to write this authoritative if not
unbiased account.
By October 1985 the ITC and its 22 member governments had run up a bill of
Pounds 900m on the LME's tin market, which it then decided not to pay.
Kestenbaum takes us through the web of contradictions, conflicts of
interest, doublespeak and humbug which allowed the ITC to get into this
position.
He also corrects a popular misconception: that the scandal of the tin crisis
was simply about the collapse in prices. More to the point was, first, that
tin prices should never have been as high as they were to begin with; and
second, that the price collapse was accompanied by the ITC's refusal to pay
its bills.
The politicians and bureaucrats who claimed to run the ITC deserve to be
highly embarrassed by this reminder of their folly.

THE POLITICAL ECONOMY OF MERCHANT EMPIRES, 1350-1750 edited by James Tracy
Cambridge Pounds 35, 504 pages
TRADE disputes between the Western economies and Japan are a feature of
modern life, so it is useful to remember that anything resembling free trade
between these states is a relatively recent development. Go a little way
back in history and there was almost no trade at all.
The central question this volume of stimulating essays sets out to explore
is why, in the space of a few centuries, the European states were able to
achieve a dominant position in global trade at the expense of often
well-organised and financed rivals, mainly in Asia.
The book examines several possible explanations. It might be argued, for
example, that the Europeans simply had better means of transport, or better
business methods including more sophisticated forms of credit. Even if Asian
business methods were in no way inferior, the Europeans were able to
overwhelm them by making devastating use of their superior armaments to
further their commercial aims.
Alternatively, the Europeans succeeded because in the likes of the East
India Companies and Portugal's Estado da India, they created forms of
organisation in which the use of violence was subordinated to the rational
pursuit of profit.
As James Tracy points out in his introduction: 'The principal feature that
differentiates European enterprises from indigenous trade networks in
various part of the globe . . . was that they organised their major
commercial ventures either as an extension of the state or as autonomous
trading companies with many of the characteristics of the state.' That
included the capacity to wage war.
Given that European traders saw themselves as beset by enemies wherever they
looked, perhaps that was just as well. The fears of Europeans stationed in
Asia were informed partly by national rivalries, but mainly by the fact that
they were all interlopers. Most historians agree that before the Europeans
arrived, Asian trade had been relatively peaceful.
Geoffrey Parker shows in a perceptive essay how Asians were appalled at the
Europeans' destructive style of warfare. He nevertheless shows that the
notion of Western powers bent on world domination is anachronistic.
Most traders, the Dutch being the notable exception, undertook military
action only either to coerce reluctant buyers or in order to safeguard
themselves against attack from their European rivals.
The book is a companion to The Rise of Merchant Empires, which dealt with
the changes in the growth and composition of long-distance trade over the
same period.
The two volumes emerged from a conference in 1987. Between them they take
the debate over the origins of modern trade to new heights.

FT  24 MAR 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (13): Liberalisation: a
policy for insurance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OBSTACLES TO THE LIBERALISATION OF TRADE IN INSURANCE by Robert Carter and
Gerard Dickinson Harvester Wheatsheaf (for the Trade Policy Research Centre)
Pounds 14.95, 208 pages
OF ALL the service industries due be liberalised as a result of the Uruguay
Round of international trade negotiations, insurance is one of the most
tricky.
This is not only because of the complex nature of the business. Foreign
participation in a country's insurance industry tends to be particularly
sensitive because it involves the collection and mobilisation of national
savings as well as protecting residents from risks.
This book offers a concise but broad-ranging description of the issues
concerned. Though only about 11 per cent of non-life insurance premiums
world-wide are written by foreign suppliers, foreign supply of reinsurance
amounts to 33 per cent.
The authors argue that there would be substantial benefits from
liberalisation. The balance of payments risks are smaller than many
developing countries fear, while consumers would gain from greater choice of
product, lower premiums and, sometimes, more expert advice on loss
prevention.
The more useful aspect is the way in which Carter and Dickinson show why the
right of establishment is so essential to any effort to liberalise the
direct insurance industry and why regulatory differences matter so much.
Foreign suppliers can suffer discrimination in a number of ways, ostensibly
because this is necessary to protect the customer. They may, for example, be
subject to greater capital requirements or barred from certain types of
business. The description that is built up of the obstacles to trade in
insurance is one that will come in handy for any layman trying to understand
insurance in the context of the overall debate on trade in services.
That said, there are drawbacks. One suspects that this book has been rather
hastily dusted down after a long period of mouldering on the shelf while the
Trade Policy Research Centre sorted out its own problems. Thus it is
somewhat surprising to see references to the Soviet approach to insurance
and to 'communist' countries like Hungary. Equally, too little is made of
the difficulties of committing federal governments to liberalise when, as is
the case with the US, it is the individual states rather than central
government that are responsible for regulation.
Nor does the book dwell on the context of US determination to break into the
potentially lucrative markets of South-east Asia which has been a potent
force behind the Gatt discussion. It does, however, provide insight into the
way the European Community has struggled to open up its internal market.
It ends with some practical advice from two authors long familiar with the
industry. First, it would be better to seek regulatory equivalence rather
than outright harmonisation of regulation; second, regulators should be
prepared to accept the principle of home country control for insurance sold
across frontiers.

THE ECONOMIST YEAR BOOK 1992 Economist Books Pounds 25, 340 pages
ATTENTION all fans of the Economist. At last you can throw away those unruly
piles of back issues with a clear conscience, for the first Economist Year
Book contains everything the average reader will want to remember about 1991
and more.
It should appeal to those who tire of the magazine's flippant content -
there is a welcome air of seriousness about the work. The pages are clearly
laid out along familiar divisions and the statistical section is as useful
as anything on the market. The Year Book should eventually build into a fine
reference collection. But readers will need to buy an aspidistra or two to
fill up their shelves in the meantime.

WEALTH BEYOND MEASURE: AN ATLAS OF NEW ECONOMICS by Paul Ekins, Mayer
Hillman and Robert Hutchison Gaia Books Pounds 9.99, 191 pages
RARELY has there been a better time for the environmental movement to
formulate new theories about how human development might occur in a way that
harms the planet less and spreads wealth more evenly.
Wealth Beyond Measure seeks to provide a structure of 'green economics'
according to which, its authors explain, the world would develop with the
pursuit of industrial growth no longer the main economic objective. The new
framework would encompass values including 'tight sustainability
constraints', 'positive human values' and 'personal development and quality
of life'.
Although it is difficult to argue against any of these concepts, the book
fails to link them into a convincing alternative vision of how the planet
could evolve. Much of the volume appears to have been written by a committee
bent on referring to just about every vaguely radical idea of the past 20
years.
It thus moves erratically between discussing improvements to the Common
Agricultural Policy, the problems of too many cars, and the misdemeanours of
Ernest Saunders. There is much that is pious and ill thought-out, as in the
pseudoscientific discussion of the connections between environmental damage
and technology and in the contentious arguments about the moral fibre of
people being harmed by too much shopping.
Anyone who wants to think about economics in a different way would find a
good check list here of topics, but a less than coherent book.

THE GREENING OF WORLD TRADE ISSUES edited by Kym Anderson and Richard
Blackhurst Harvester Wheatsheaf Pounds 40/Pounds 13.99, 275 pages
EVEN BEFORE the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations draws to a
close, new issues are piling up on the agenda of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and trade.
Sir Leon Brittan, the UK's senior European Commissioner, recently confirmed
what many trade experts have accepted for some time - that competition
policy will feature large in trade negotiations of the future. This book
deals with the other, and possibly more urgent issue of the 1990s: the link
between trade and environment policy.
It is not difficult to see why the two are related. The bottom line for
trade policy is, after all, the location of jobs. The ultimate reason why
Italy has fought to keep Japanese cars out of its home market is to preserve
employment at Fiat. Environmental controls may, however, distort the
international competitive conditions in which particular industries operate.
As a result, jobs may be lost and growth opportunities jeopardised.
There are already several examples of how environmental policy can clash
with the free trade principles espoused by the Gatt. The US embargo on
Mexican tuna which was imposed to protect the dolphin is one such case.
European aluminium makers are complaining about the way in which Russian
producers, who do not face strict pollution controls, are flooding the West
with cheap products. Conservationist lobby groups in the rich developed
world have succeeded in curbing trade in African ivory.
The Greening of World Trade Issues explores the link between trade policy
and the environment from a number of perspectives. How far are 'solutions'
to environmental problems likely to provoke trade friction? How far is there
a conflict, as some US environmentalists claim, between the ideals of free
trade and environmental protection? Will it be necessary to use trade
incentives to persuade countries such as Brazil to protect the rain forest?
And, if so, will this also conflict with the ideal of non-discriminatory
free trade.
While recognising the legitimacy of environmentalist aims, the book argues
that the impact of certain policies on the trading environment could be
enormous. Severe restrictions on the use of coal, for example, would be a
threat to the China's development prospects.
Since some compromises will have to be made, it is all the more imperative
that the right policy approach is chosen. Some environmentalists argue that
trade liberalisation is a priori harmful because it increases consumption,
but this need not be the case. Liberalisation of world farm trade could help
by reducing the use of pesticides in over-farmed industrial countries.
The book takes the form of a carefully structured series of essays
originally written as background papers for the recent Gatt report on
International Trade 1990-1. It should be noted that this is a book written
by economists for economists. A large part of it is taken up with the
development of models showing the impact of various environmental policies
on the trading system and vice versa.
The underlying message is, however, clear. There is a real fear of an unholy
alliance between environmentalist and protectionist lobbies which could be
seriously counter-productive. Indeed, as the book concludes: 'It is even
possible that protectionist groups would manipulate the design or
implementation of environmental measures to such a degree that the net
effect would be an increase in environmental degradation.'
Trade policy-makers must therefore alert themselves to the implications of
the environment debate. In particular, a clear idea is needed as to what set
of policies would best meet both the objectives of free trade and
environmental protection. There is a clear preference in the book for a
market orientated approach, even possibly involving the freedom to auction
'pollution permits.'
There is a difficulty with this kind of approach in that a windfall benefit
would accrue to firms which sold their permits. Similarly, the idea of a
worldwide tax on polluters raises questions about how the proceeds should be
distributed. However, many other controls favoured by environmentalists,
such as production restraints or process and product standards, lend
themselves more readily to abuse by protectionists.
While the argument over policy rages, the risk is that all sorts of
protectionist measures will be introduced in the name of the environment.
The academics will have to refine their argument quickly and ensure they get
a proper public airing, if the baby is not to be lost with the bathwater.
This book, and the recent Gatt report, constitute an admirable effort,
though they are only a start.

THE TRADE TRAP: POVERTY AND THE GLOBAL COMMODITY MARKETS by Belinda Coote
Oxfam Pounds 5.95, 214 pages
MANY POOR developing countries appear to be caught in a trap: during a
decade in which some have become even poorer, the commodities which they
export have fallen steadily in price. The trend appears irreversible. Trade
barriers have made the transition to higher-value-added processing a fraught
one.
The problems are real. It is good that Oxfam, in its latest publication,
should focus attention on them. However, it is astonishing that it should
have come to the conclusion that managed trade through charitably-based
'alternative trading organisations' in the west, and 'development friendly
consumerism' provides any serious solution to such problems.
The most disappointing aspect of the book is that it may be the only one on
trade and developing countries that many interested readers see in the UK
this year: it is saddening that such a glib and simplistic assessment of
Third World problems, hyped by Oxfam's powerful publicity machine, is likely
to have such influence.
The book's case studies, based on Oxfam's extensive field experience in the
developing world, provide interesting and valuable material. But the
sentimental analysis has roots in the sort of dogma that used to exude from
the (now metamorphosing) Unctad during the 1970s: blame for the poor's
problems must be laid at the door of multinationals which rape a country's
resources unfettered by national control, exploiting the poor, and ruining
their environment; a rich men's club controls the rules of world trade, and
exploits them ruthlessly at the expense of the poor.
Where is necessary attention paid to the importance of local wars and the
diversion of precious funds to military spending, to local corruption,
massively inefficient state planning systems, uncontrolled population
growth? Where is an effort to explain why some countries in the developing
world have escaped poverty while others have remained mired?
It is almost cruel to suggest to farmers in the Third World that salvation
might be found in 'alternative trading organisations' that provide the same
distorted price and market signals that protectionism and state socialism
have provided so damagingly in the past.
It is just such muddled logic that has led to the cossetting of Europe's
farmers through the Common Agriculture Policy (CAP) that costs European
taxpayers so dear, and so damages world prices for the commodities on which
exporters from the Third World depend.

COUTTS &amp; CO. 1692-1992: THE PORTRAIT OF A PRIVATE BANK by Edna Healey Hodder
&amp; Stoughton Pounds 25, 488 pages
COUTTS &amp; Co has always enjoyed understatement. An account-holding friend
once entered the Strand bank to withdraw funds, offering no identification
but a name tag in his underpants. The response? 'That won't be necessary,
sir.'
There is sparse understatement in Edna Healey's sprawling portrait of
Coutts; little is omitted in the 300-years history of this private bank. It
is a thorough, hefty book ripe for tasting rather than digestion.
Since its foundation in 1692 by the Scottish goldsmith John Campbell, Coutts
has been a civilised and discreet institution, polite yet apart. Healey
rightly sets Coutts's history in a political and economic context. Her
complicity with the Bank's long view can at times make the narrative
clogged. But the long view is the right perspective from which to see, for
example, the 1577 Usury Law (initially limiting lenders to 10 per cent
interest, although further changes reduced the rate) which remained in force
until 1857.
Moreover, Healey everywhere makes plain that Coutts is a long-term survivor.
From the madness of the South Sea Bubble (1719-20) and the great South
American investment crisis in 1820s England, it endured the speculation
mania of the 1840s, typifying the Victorian perception that the aristocracy
of wealth now nicely balanced that of descent.
Then in 1892, in the wake of the Baring crisis over the Buenos Aires Water
Supply and Drainage Co, Coutts became a joint stock bank with unlimited
liability; as Walter Bagehot said: 'A bank lives on credit. Till it is
trusted it is nothing; and when it ceases to be trusted it returns to
nothing.' Its affiliation with the National Provincial Bank since 1920 and
with National Westminster since 1969 provided stability without quashing
independence. Now Coutts sees itself as a worldwide but select private bank.
Healey everywhere stresses the resilience of Coutts as an institution; she
values the dynasties within the partnerships, such as that of Edmund
Antrobus, Edward Marjoriebanks and their respective juniors who spanned 1777
to 1870, those 'quiet men of business' whom Walter Bagehot so esteemed.
Confidence and continuity were paramount. When Coutts became a joint stock
bank of unlimited liability, a brief explanation was sent to Queen
Victoria's private secretary: 'We trust that this explanation may enable you
to convey such information as you may think proper with our humble duty to
Her Majesty whose Gracious patronage of our House has ever been our most
cherished privilege.'
That royal connection has undoubtedly carved out a public image for Coutts.
Perhaps there are other markets to conquer: the wife of the present chairman
of Coutts &amp; Co Group has in her car a window-sticker which reads 'Carpenter
of Nazareth requires joiners'; does this mean that the bankers to royalty
will soon become bankers to deity?

THE CITY OF LONDON: CONTINUITY AND CHANGE by Ranald C Mitchie Macmillan
Pounds 30, 238 pages
THE SCENE: a London dinner-party in the 1850s.
Thackeray's daughter: 'And what is your profession?'
The man from Barings: 'A merchant.'
Miss Thackeray: 'A merchant] I picture you to myself sitting at your desk by
an open window overlooking the broad estuary of the Thames. You glance from
time to time at the distant reaches of the river. Presently you see a noble
ship taking advantage of the incoming tide. She is yours and she is laden
with precious tribute from foreign countries . . .'
THERE ARE not many noble ships coming up the Thames in Ranald C. Michie's
City, nor for that matter merchants gossiping on 'Change, nor stockbrokers
being hammered, nor black-coated clerks scrawling away laboriously at
sloping desks. Altogether this is a book short on City atmosphere.
Does it matter? The answer is broadly 'no', for what Michie has provided
instead is a well-organised, challenging and in many ways pioneering
technical history of the modern City.
In four central chapters - 'Commercial City', 'Credit City', 'Capital City',
'Client City' - he divides the City into what he sees as having been its key
functional components, and within them he gives a tightly argued
chronological overview of each.
There is relatively little archival research, but he has done what no one
has had either the insight or the stamina to do before, which is to read and
draw appropriate conclusions from a thousand unambitious histories of a
thousand unambitious, niche firms - that cumulative corporate history of the
myriad-like, disintegrated City before it all changed.
The most striking of these chapters is the one on the Commercial City.
Michie shows that up to 1914, and arguably up to 1939, the City was
predominantly a commercial centre rather than a financial one. This was less
through its handling of physical trade, important though that was until the
port of London's post-1945 decline, but was connected to all the major
commercial centres by telegraph and 'the result of this communications
revolution was that it became possible to conduct a global trading business
from an office in the City.'
And, often through the ill-appreciated work of continental immigrants, the
City before 1914 'was the only commercial centre in the world that possessed
the range and depth of personnel, experience, institutions and facilities to
handle the increasingly large and complex network of international trade.'
Now it is very different. The two world wars cost the City dear in lost
contacts and expertise; the end of Empire, informal as well as formal, broke
many ties with London; the commodity markets after 1945 only falteringly
returned to free trading; and the City merchant became almost an
anachronism. There have been growth areas - such as in countertrade - but
overall the picture is one of decline.
What has at least partially come to the square mile's rescue is Client City
 -by which Michie means a whole range of client-orientated services,
including accountancy and merchant banking, all activities which have risen
in importance while market-based activities have dwindled. Michie is perhaps
over-schematic about this - is securities trading, for instance, a
client-based or market-based activity? - but it is a new way of looking at
the City's more recent history that demands consideration.
A final chapter takes the long-swing approach. He sees 1914 to 1971 (when
fixed exchange rates broke down) as a regrettable, over-regulated hiatus,
and interprets the era since then as a chequered attempt to return to the
'normal' pre-1914 world of unfettered capital flows.
He is neither bull nor bear about the City's future, though one senses a
scepticism as to whether the City will really 'ensure that competitive
forces pervade all its markets and services.' And he considers briskly the
old chestnut of the City's responsibility for British economic decline,
concluding that since both City and the larger economy have been in relative
decline since 1945, they are probably both part of the same problem.
All in all, not a book for a budding novelist, but the man from Barings
should take it on board.

FRAUD: PREVENTION AND DETECTION by Ian Huntington Butterworths Pounds 55,
234 pages
A COMPANY once claimed that a large part of its profits were earned on
exports by an overseas subsidiary. But an investigator found that the
subsidiary's claimed sales figures far exceeded the exports recorded in the
particular country's own Official statistics.
Fraud is a topical subject and this comprehensive book is being published at
a time when many businesses and their auditors and other consultants are
concerned at the risks.
How can fraud be deterred or, if all else fails, at any rate detected? Ian
Huntington, a partner with KPMG Peat Marwick, and currently at the Serious
Fraud Office, packs a great deal of expert knowledge into this book,
although he confesses that there is a risk that not only investigators but
also potential new fraudsters might learn something about the tricks of the
trade.
Sensitive antennae are required. The author mentions the case, for example,
of a Far East bank branch where an investigator noticed that the accounting
machines were being used on a Sunday. It turned out that key customers of
the branch were routinely allowed to produce their own versions of their
bank statements.
This book is not, however, intended to be a popular exposition of various
entertaining scams, but rather a step-by-step guide to how the risks can be
minimised. Fraud is 'concealed stealing' says the author. The task is
therefore to make it more difficult for rogues to hide payments or invent
transactions.
Various standard dodges can be checked for, and fraudsters entrenched in an
organisation may at least be discouraged if they fear that new systems
increase the risks of discovery. Nevertheless it will always be harder to
catch the more slippery characters who are capable of innovation.
Ian Huntington provides instructions on how to carry out a fraud
'health-check' and gives checklists for investigators. Fraud, he admits, may
be clever, and it may even seem glamorous. But he points out that the
fraudsters are motivated by nothing more attractive than pure greed. Those
seeking to deal with fraud must begin by casting aside any mystique and
focusing on the unpleasant underlying reality.

RIVAL STATES, RIVAL FIRMS: COMPETTION FOR WORLD MARKET SHARES by John
Stopford and Susan Strange Cambridge, 321 pages
THIS BOOK is the result of an unusual collaboration by two eminent
specialists. Stopford is a leading business school researcher, while Strange
is well known for her publications on international relations. They have
taken on the subject of the relations between multinationals and governments
in developing countries, covering under this heading the gamut of topics
from technical change and development strategy to the nitty gritty of
decision making in business and bargaining with officials.
The setting is apt. World flows of foreign direct investment (FDI)are
booming. After a slackening of activity in the early 1980s, a sustained
burst of energy and optimism has seized the multinationals. Their
international activity is now spreading faster than world trade or
production. The increasing share of global industry and services accounted
for by MNCs is regarded with welcome rather than resentment or fear by most
governments in the developing countries. The growing pace of technical
change, along with revolutionary improvements in transport, communications
and financial markets, binds all countries closer together in a web of
competition and cooperation, with MNCs among the leading players,
While these are not new trends, the current boom in FDI differs in several
ways from that in the 60s and 70s. The US, once the largest net exporter of
capital, is now the largest recipient. There are several major new players
in the world league, from Japan, Europe and even the developing countries.
However, the share of FDl going to developing countries, once rising, is now
declining, and the real value of flows to them in 1989-90 was lower than a
dozen years previously The flows have also changed direction and become more
concentrated. Just when governments are clamouring for more FDI, the
investors, driven by the needs of global competition and the search for
efficient locations (with skilled labour, good infrastructure,reliable local
suppliers and conducive legal environments), are focusing on the relatively
advanced countries in East and South-east Asia. Success in attracting FDl
is, in other words, directly linked with success in industrial strategy more
generally, one reinforcing the other.
What then accounts for the success of East Asia, in particular for the
historically unprecedented growth and Industrial prowess of Korea and
Taiwan? A common perception is that they developed' by pursuing liberal
market-oriented policies and relying heavily on MNCs.
This simple view is unrealistic and misleading. Markets are never as
efficient as theories make out, and in developing countries they are very
prone to 'failure'. The success of Korea and Taiwan is due to the pervasive
and prolonged interventions they undertook to remedy such failures, by
building up education, protecting infant industries, fostering indigenous
technological activity, setting up numerous institutions, and promoting
local enterprise by restricting foreign entry. They were certainly export
oriented,and the pattern oftheir interventions differed radically from that
in most other developing countries- but they intervened nonetheless. If they
are the role models, governments retain the central role in development.
They can still be the guardians of national interest rather than a
collection of bumbling, corrupt bureaucrats.
This is the view taken by the authors of this book. They debunk many of the
simplistic notions that seem to pervade much of development thinking. They
survey evidence from a range of firms and from three countries (Brazil,
Kenya and Malaysia) to illustrate how complex,even bewildering, is the real
world of decision making in politics and business, and how difficult it is
to define ideal strategies.
They stress the fundamentals of economic progress (the chapter by Henley is
very good) and emphasise how technological change calls for human resource
development and astute, flexible policy responses by governments. They do
not directly address the issue of optimal interventions, but that may be
because they do not see a generalisable pattern of policies for diverse
countries.
In their view, governments and MNCs have much to gain from each other.
However, their relations are not always complementary. It is inherent in the
nature of the phenomenon that conflicts of interest can arise between MNCs
and developing countries, and it is only governments that can resolve them.
In the past the resolution has often been biased and harmful, and better
understanding of technological realities and business can help to improve
policy making in the future. The book closes with many sensible suggestions
for both parties.

<TEXT>
THE MONEY LAUNDERERS by Robert E Powis Probus Europe Pounds 15.95, 328 pages
THERE has got to be a great movie in this book. It has everything to
fascinate and to titillate - from mobsters to sex, crooked bank employees
and indifferent bank managers, drug peddlers and money launderers,
smoke-filled rooms and bent politicians, fast cars, yachts and aircraft. At
the core: how the drug barons and their hordes of henchmen and small-time
crooks launder the estimated Dollars 120bn (Pounds 68.1bn) which Americans
spend on drugs every year.
This tale is very much what Americans call a big buck ticket; the numbers
are big, and so are the names, from the collapsed Bank of Credit and
Commerce International (BCCI) to former Panamanian dictator General Manuel
Noriega. Big name banks, who either colluded in the re-cycling of drug money
or were duped by the crooks include, according to this account, Bank of
America, Manufacturers Hanover, Crocker National, Citibank, Chemical, Bank
of New England- indeed, the great and the good of the banking world who did
not know, or did not want to know, the difference between real money and
sleaze money.
First a definition: money laundering amounts to the use of money derived
from illegal activities by concealing the identity of the individuals who
obtained the cash, and converts it to assets that appear to have come from a
legitimate source. This author's definition is more straight-forward: the
washing of dirty money to make it appear clean.
And he should know. Robert Powis is a former US Secret Service agent who
served in Washington as a top Treasury official coordinating enforcement
against money laundering and was also involved in the administration of the
Bank Secrecy Act. Powis writes it as he says it was over the past 20 years,
and still is to a large extent, despite more and more legislation and more
enforcement. He calculates that some 80 per cent of money from illegal US
drug sales finds its way into the American banking system, often with the
knowledge of greedy bankers anxious for ever more deposits; the rest takes
wing, mainly via banks in Switzerland and Italy, and some in seemingly
legitimate gold and jewellery businesses in London.
A little - everything is relative when the annual sum touches on Dollars
120bn - even finds it way in covert operations run by the Central
Intelligence Agency, such as the Contra affair which former President Ronald
Reagan said he knew nothing about. Powis throws no new light on this.
Facts are there aplenty. Witness a small motel room in the American
Mid-West: a group of 'smurfs', so called by Treasury special agents after
the blue cherubs made famous in television cartoons, whose task it was to
launder drug money by using the local Yellow Pages to check out bank
addresses and be assigned to branches where they would open accounts, or
obtain bearer cheques, for something short of Dollars 10,000. This is the
maximum over which banks must (or should) conform with the 1970 Bank Secrecy
Act requiring that they report to the Internal Revenue Service currency
transactions over Dollars 10,000 on behalf of the same person on the same
day. The 'smurfs' stopped a dollar short, and most banks willingly bought
the re-cycled drugs money.
'A smurf could dispose of between Dollars 50,000 and Dollars 100,000 in cash
each day, and typically be paid between 0.5 and 1.5 per cent, depending upon
his experience and ability. A smurf who disposed of Dollars 100,000 would be
paid somewhere between Dollars 500 and Dollars 1,000 for a day's work. The
individual in charge of a road trip would get about 1.5 per cent of all the
money laundered; in addition, he would get 0.5 per cent of all currency that
he personally laundered at banks.'
The whole business become labour-intensive, and new and bigger ways were
arranged, often involving flying the money out of the US to Mexico or
Switzerland; indeed, at one point some dishonest airline stewards with deep
pockets were recruited to do the work, at a price. Some existing Italian
resort apartment complexes are monuments to this re-cycling process, says
Powis.
But his is not just a cracking yarn. He has much that is useful to say about
the need for stricter compliance procedures in banks around the world,
particularly his reference to the 'Know your client' philosophy.
He admires the so-called Basle Agreement, under which the Group of 10
industrial nations have agreed principles to try and limit the re-cycling of
illicit cash through the banking system, but suggests that much more needs
to be done within the US banking system itself. He thinks that politicians
are hard on the regulators and soft on the drugs barons, not out of
misplaced sympathy but because of concern about how the policemen police the
crooks, including their occasional short cuts which erode individual rights.
All in all, quite a read - and watch out for the movie.

WHAT'S NEW IN ECONOMICS? edited by Jim Maloney Manchester University Press
Pounds 40,326 pages
FEW assets depreciate as fast as a book on new developments in economics.
Even the economic journals are generally a year or two out of date by the
time they are published. Keeping up to date with the latest research instead
involves wading through vast mail-bags of working papers.
Only a small band of the committed have either the time or the inclination
to read all the new papers in any field. Much new research is, in any case,
a new variation on a broader theme which evolves at a more gradual pace.
The nine contributors to What's New In Economics? have done the donkey work
on everyone else's behalf. Each essay covers a broad theme in economics -
labour, industrial, international monetary economics, etc - and examines how
research in that field has evolved over the past decade or so.
Written for an economically-literate but non-mathematical audience, most of
the essays are mercifully short on equations while not skimping on either
graphs or references. Most of the fashionable subjects are covered: the
application of game theory to industry, the 'micro-foundations' of
macroeconomics, imperfect competition and international trade theory.
Not all the chapters are complete: the discussion of labour economics, for
example, appears to omit efficiency wages, perhaps the most important strand
of labour research in recent years; while the macroeconomics chapter omits
any reference to the blossoming new endogenous growth literature. All of the
contributions would have benefited from a greater attention to empirical
research.
Overall, though, this book is well worth the effort. Read it soon; it will
be out of date by Christmas.

NATIONAL CRISIS AND NATIONAL GOVERNMENT 1926-1932 by Philip Williamson
Cambridge Pounds 60, 569 pages
THE DECISION to return sterling to the gold standard was one of the many
disastrous mistakes of the inter-war years.
The intention to return was announced in November 1918, in the exuberant
month when the war ended. It was regarded as a long-term policy aspiration
of no immediate relevance and nobody took much notice. But political
promises which benefit particular groups are not forgotten. From the
beginning, the debate was not about whether to return to fixed exchange
rates, but when.
The promise was eventually redeemed in 1925 by Churchill when he was
chancellor. The date was chosen for no better reason than that the
government wanted to avoid having to ask Parliament for a renewal of the Act
by which gold payments had been suspended.
Despite the huge and differing disruptions and inflations that had occurred
in the world's economies since 1914, the pound was pegged at the pre-war
rate of Dollars 4.86. Seldom has a decision of such national importance been
taken with so little thought.
To many eyes, the exchange rate was a technical matter to be left to
bankers. Others saw it in terms of national prestige. The Bank of England,
still entirely independent of government, was well aware that, at that time,
most British investments abroad were in fixed interest bonds. If exporting
industry was rendered hopelessly uncompetitive at par, then, it argued,
manufacturers should cut their costs.
The UK, already in deep depression, was to pay a heavy price for this folly
as the downward spiral was reinforced with falling demand leading to yet
more unemployment, business failures, and social misery. The losses from the
decision were estimated by Keynes at over 10 per cent of national output
every year.
The interesting book by Philip Williamson, National Crisis and National
Government, tells how the mistake was eventually reversed. He describes day
by day the course of events which led to the financial crisis of July 1931
and the replacement of the minority Labour government by the coalition of
Conservatives, 'National Liberals' and a rump of Labour ministers who
followed Macdonald into the National Government.
Williamson has assiduously explored the papers of most of the actors in the
drama. He shows how they responded to the pressures, new and unexpected, and
follows the shifting alliances and compromises, both party and personal, as
the crisis unfolded.
His book is political history in a narrow sense, largely confined to the
tumble of events as seen and interpreted by politicians at Westminster. No
attempt is made to analyse the different options that were open to the
government or to trace the real effects of the decisions taken. But as a
study of how politics actually works his book has a relentless fascination.
When the exchange rate came under pressure, it became accepted that what the
country needed was 'retrenchment', meaning principally a cut in unemployment
relief.
The unemployed, it was argued, had benefited from the fall in prices. But
then so had the owners of the gilts by which the war had been financed. In
an attempt to buy the good-will of foreign financiers, the National
Government imposed a further huge dose of deflation on a suffering nation.
Taxes were raised by 10 per cent. Public service pay was cut, that of
teachers by 15 per cent. Even when mutinies broke out in the Navy, when
India looked set to be dragged down in the wake, and overt class war in the
streets seemed inevitable, the policy was persisted with in a display of
stolid tenacity reminiscent of the generals of the Somme. Only Keynes, Bevin
and Mosley (who was not yet a fascist) showed any understanding of the real
issues and choices, along with the old-fashioned patriot, the Marquess of
Lothian.
In the end, the Bank itself stopped gold payments on its own authority, to
the amazement of Labour politicians. 'They never told us we could do that,'
they were to complain later, and not without justice.
For, contrary to expectation, the heavens did not fall. Indeed, things
immediately started to get better. The fall in sterling was modest, and
within months there was a clear revival of economic activity and a reduction
in unemployment which was to continue unabated over subsequent years.
The National Government had its reward. In the general election of October
1931, the coalition whose only reason for coming together had been to resist
devaluation at all costs, and which had been overwhelmed in the attempt, was
re-elected with the biggest majority in history. They were secure to make
further disastrous decisions involving repression in India and appeasement
of the dictators in Europe.
The story that Williamson's book tells is deeply depressing. At a time when
many voices favour the fixed exchange rates of the ERM, and when there is
talk of giving responsibility for monetary policy to an independent central
bank, it is of more than historical interest.

Review of the sorry tale of Peter Clowes, and finds that the City must share

THE BARLOW CLOWES AFFAIR by Lawrence Lever Macmillan Pounds 17.50, 277 pages
THE Barlow Clowes affair, they will tell you in the Square Mile, was not a
City scandal. The chap was a complete outsider: no one had even heard of him
until he went bust.
It is true that Peter Clowes - the head of the failed investment company,
who was recently sentenced to 10 years in prison for stealing millions of
pounds of investors' money - was never remotely part of Britain's financial
establishment. But the first conclusion to be drawn from Lawrence Lever's
impressive book is that Barlow Clowes was a City scandal in this important
respect: he could never have got as far as he did, or duped as many gullible
investors, if he had not been able to exploit the infrastructure of the
great financial and commercial institutions in the City of London.
There is no suggestion that any of them realised that Clowes was a crook, or
willingly went along with his wrongdoing. But the truly remarkable feature
is that they were prepared to do business with a man whose activities - to
judge by this account - would have been laughable if they had not been so
ruinous.
Peter Clowes gained credibility by the fact that he had highly respectable
advisers: Herbert Smith as lawyers, Spicer and Pegler as auditors. 'The
business has now engaged reputable City firms of solicitors and accountants
to advise them on their activities . . . I recommend that the licences
should be granted without further delay,' wrote a Department of Trade and
Industry adviser in a submission that was to legitimise Clowes' UK
activities.
Top merchant banks - Lazard, Warburg, and Rothschild - unwittingly helped
him to syphon money out of his clients' accounts by extending back-to-back
loans. Under these arrangements, Clowes was able to borrow large sums from
the banks for his own use on security which actually belonged to clients.
Two clearing banks, Midland and Lloyds, continued to process his
instructions to transfer funds out of the offshore investors' accounts even
after suggestions that something funny was afoot. In Lever's words: 'Without
their innate caution, Clowes could never have gone as far as he did.'
The picture that emerges is of a man who by a combination of luck and brazen
effrontery was able to steal many millions of pounds from under the very
noses of the regulatory authorities. The story is rife with examples of
messages that were ignored by the relevant authorities or did not get
through to the right person. Information was held by different regulators in
discrete pockets, instead of being brought together to reveal the whole
picture.
No one wanted to be responsible for the drama which would follow from
closing Barlow Clowes: no one had enough initiative to step outside the
immediate sphere of regulatory influence and ask the big questions. Everyone
wanted to pass the buck.
Thus, when the crucial licences were granted, a DTI official suggested that
they should be sent with a covering letter to Herbert Smith pointing out
that the department had relied heavily on the legal firm's assurances. 'This
may give them (Herbert Smith) an incentive to let us know quickly if they
find in the future that they have been hoodwinked.' As neat a piece of back
covering as you could imagine.
In the words of the prosecuting counsel at the trial, Clowes ' was helped by
the reactions of those who strayed dangerously near to discovering the
truth. There seems to have been a reluctance in some of them to believe that
a fraud of this nature and scale could have been perpetrated.'
There are obvious parallels here with the Robert Maxwell affair, both in the
City's willing suspension of disbelief and in the character of the man and
his business. For Clowes, deception became a matter of routine. The process
was facilitated by a dense web of offshore companies and by the construction
of a financial control system which only he could fully understand.
The one thing that really mattered was that more money should be coming in
than was flowing out in repayments to investors. That way there would be no
awkward complaints from the public, and there would be enough left over for
all the trappings of tycoonery. There were the yachts, the private jets, and
the imaginative extravagances. On one private jet trip to Jersey costing
thousands, Mrs Clowes wrote a single word on the disembarkation card to
describe the purpose of her visit: 'lunch'.
There are familiar lessons to be drawn from all this. As Lever says, no
system of investor protection can cater for people who succumb to promises
of excessively high rates of return. He quotes Professor Gower, the
architect of Britain's financial services legislation: 'Regulation should be
no greater than is necessary to protect reasonable people from being made
fools of.'
For those who were prepared to look, Barlow Clowes' schemes carried all the
well-known danger signals. There was the prominent use of the word
'guarantee' - a promise that should almost always make investors reach for
their revolvers, especially if it is made by a tinpot outfit with no record.
There were the high rates of return, and the lack of transparency. And yet,
right up to the very end, the money poured in.
Could it happen again? Lever's verdict is that the Financial Services Act,
which came into effect too late to nip Barlow Clowes in the bud, will make
it harder in future for frauds to cheat the public systematically on a large
scale. If they do, they will be caught sooner under the new system than
under the old. But sooner, he warns, could still mean a period of years.
It is true that one of the very first acts of the newly-formed Securities
and Investments Board was to grasp the nettle which other supervisors had
been avoiding for years: in May 1988, it closed Barlow Clowes. But Britain's
regulatory structure remains fragmented, with responsibilities shared
between the Bank of England and a range of self-regulatory organisations.
The story of confusion and buck passing told in The Barlow Clowes Affair
will strengthen the hand of those who argue that the UK's system of
financial regulation needs to be made still less complex in structure and
more pro-active in style.
Lever claims that Barlow Clowes was the largest financial scandal of the
century. But he is already out of date - and the fact is that the current
title holder, the Maxwell disaster, took place largely under the auspices of
the new City regulators.

The Slovak parliament yesterday rejected for the third time an attempt to
proclaim the region's sovereignty, which would be the first step towards
declaring independence and splitting Czechoslovakia, Reuter reports from
Prague.
The Slovak National Council in Bratislava threw out a motion by Mr Jozef
Prokes, leader of the separatist Slovak National Party, to discuss a law
which would have pronounced the sovereignty of the eastern of
Czechoslovakia's two republics, Czechoslovak radio reported.
Czech politicians say such a move would be unconstitutional. But several of
the major Slovak parties have already adopted a declaration of sovereignty
ahead of a general election due in June.

Georgia said in a letter to the EC it accepted the conditions for
recognition, which included guaranteeing the rule of law, democracy and

FT  24 MAR 92 / Portuguese inflation and trade figures better than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PORTUGAL'S trade and inflation performance is improving more quickly than
previously forecast, according to Mr Jose Alberto Tavares Moreira, the
central bank governor.
The trade balance improved sharply in January and inflation has been slowing
since the beginning of the year, according to recent figures which officials
argue show the economy is performing better than expected.
At the end of February, average annualised inflation was down from 11.4 per
cent for the whole of 1991 to 10.2 per cent. The trade deficit fell by
almost 40 per cent in January as a result of a surge in exports, which grew
by 17.4 per cent compared with January 1991.
Mr Moreira told the Financial Times that improvement on both fronts
demonstrated the economy was performing much better than was forecast by the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development in its annual report
on Portugal published last month.
'The trend is positive, and the (economic) convergence process (with the
richer European Community states) is clearly moving ahead,' he said.
'At 0.2 per cent the inflation rate is already 0.3 percentage points below
the OECD's forecast of 10.5 per cent for the whole of 1992. If the current
trend continues, the target of 8.5 per cent inflation is very much within
reach.'
He said price increases should slow further in March, though new value added
tax rates coming into force in April could temporarily reverse the trend.
The results demonstrated the correctness of the current tight monetary and
foreign exchange policies, he said.
'The dramatic improvement in the trade balance shows that the exchange rate
policy (to maintain a strong escudo) is not as serious a constraint on
industry as has been argued,' he added.
He said there were no special reasons for January's strong export
performance. Trade with Portugal's major partners such as Spain showed a
similar pattern.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT least eight people were killed yesterday in Bosnia-Hercegovina in the
worst day of violence since Moslems and Croats in the central republic
earlier this month voted to break away from Yugoslavia.
Six federal army soldiers and two Croat militiamen were killed in fighting
near Neum, on Bosnia's patch of Adriatic coastline. Local officials reached
by telephone yesterday accused the Serb-controlled federal army of 'using
multiple rocket launchers, mortars and artillery to launch over 1,000
projectiles on outlying Croat villages.' A member of the town's crisis team
said over 2,000 army troops have massed near Neum, 90 per cent Croat, which
lies just north of a self-proclaimed Serb autonomous region.
Clashes have escalated in Bosnia since Moslems and Croats, two of the
republic's three main ethnic groups, voted in favour of independence. Serbs,
who make up about one-third of the republic's 4.4m population have raised
roadblocks in protest against Bosnian independence.
At the same time several people were reported wounded in gunfights yesterday
between Serbs and Moslems in Gorazde, 30 miles southeast of Sarajevo, the
Bosnian capital, which has been designated the headquarters for the United
Nations peacekeeping forces.
Mr Hadzo Ifendic, the mayor of Gorazde, said the clashes began when Serbs
demanded a greater share of petrol which has been rationed in Gorazde.
Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency, said Serbs seized a television
transmitter after the Moslems took control of the local police station and a
factory. It said shops were closed and the streets remained deserted after
the rival ethnic groups exchanged gunfire and raised several road blocks in
and around Gorazde.
But a western observer yesterday attributed the renewed clashes to 'last
minute pushing and shoving' before the 14,000 UN peacekeepers are deployed
to neighbouring Croatia. Many diplomats believe the presence of peacekeepers
in Croatia will calm the volatile ethnic groups in Bosnia, where
peacekeepers will not be despatched.
Some 500 members of a UN advance team are already in the three UN protected
areas in Croatia.
The UN says a stable ceasefire is a requirement for the deployment of
peacekeepers. But UN officials reached by telephone in their headquarters in
Sarajevo yesterday declined to comment on the most recent violations of the
11-week-old UN-brokered ceasefire.
Mr Fred Eckhard, the UN spokesman, said: 'Our eyes and ears are not yet
established well enough for us to establish who's doing what to whom.'
Croatian and Serbian media yesterday also accused each other of violating
the ceasefire in fighting around Vinkovci, eastern Croatia.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Wine scandal prompts quality control tests

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN government announced yesterday it had ordered quality controls
on all domestically produced table wines in a bid to improve the image of
Italian wine after a doctoring scandal, Reuter reports from Rome.
A decree due to come into force at the end of this month, published in the
official gazette, will extend tests already imposed on top-quality
Denominazione di Origine Controllata (DOC) wines.
Italian table wine is currently not subject to statutory testing.
Police in the Veneto region around northern Padua arrested four men in
January and seized 4m litres (880,000 gallons) of cheap red and white wine
laced with a pesticide.
Contaminated wine from Italy, which vies with France as the world's biggest
wine producer, has since been seized in France and Germany.
Britain's Marks and Spencer chain store recalled two types, white Pinot
Grigio and red Merlot.
'Wine-growers and merchants all wanted tests to safeguard the image of
Italian wine,' said a spokesman for the Confagricoltura association grouping
several thousand producers.
'This is a sign to consumers abroad and in Italy that there are no doubts on
the quality of the wine.'
Under the decree from the agriculture ministry, Italian table wine will be
subjected to 16 tests including alcohol content, acidity and the presence of
the chemical methylisothiocyanate.
It was the discovery of traces of this chemical, used in fruit fungicides,
in the Veneto wine that sparked the scandal earlier this year.
Wine producers have estimated that when the scandal first broke, sales of
Italian wine slumped by 18 per cent in Britain and close to 8 per cent in
Germany.
The doctored wine is harmless unless drunk in huge quantities.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Italian Elections: Mafia plot theory enlivens poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITHIN the space of a week Italy's Christian Democrat-led government has
managed the unusual feat of both inventing and dismissing a nationwide plot
to destablise the country's elections on April 5.
The ill-explained conspiracy was advanced by Mr Enzo Scotti, the interior
minister, to account for the presumed Mafia killing of Mr Salvatore Lima,
the Euro-MP and most powerful Christian Democrat politician in Sicily. But
now even Mr Giulio Andreotti, the prime minister and a close friend of Mr
Lima, has dismissed the conspiracy theory as 'a worthless piece of paper.'
Indeed, it has emerged that the only people to give credence to the idea of
occult forces at work in concert to destabilise the elections were Mr
Scotti, a Bologna magistrate, and a dubious prisoner with a record of
previous disinformation who purveyed a story claiming Mafia elements had a
hit list of senior politicians.
Over the weekend, Mr Andreotti said acting on this informer's evidence was
like clearing a school when a student has telephoned with a bomb scare.
The affair looks as though it is now being buried as quickly as it was
raised, the Christian Democrat leadership recognising that the electorate
was unimpressed and that to pursue the matter risked serious embarrassment.
As it is, the opposition have had a field day, criticising a crude attempt
to manipulate voters' sympathy. L'Unita, the daily of the former communist
party, the Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), carried a full page
advertisement labelled 'the worthless pieces of paper' with a picture of the
government.
The ruling party's principal approach continues to emphasise the risks of
votes going to the smaller parties which will weaken the prospects of a new
coalition with their Socialist partners.
However, the weekend results of France's regional elections, closely watched
in Italy, could give further encouragement to protests going to parties such
as the Republicans (PRI), the populist Lombard League, parties backing
referendums and the Greens.

FT  24 MAR 92 / Emu doomed to failure without political union, says
Tietmeyer
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG warning that European monetary union could be 'doomed to failure'
unless it was coupled with continent-wide political union was given
yesterday by Mr Hans Tietmeyer, vice-president of the German Bundesbank.
'Further progress towards political union is probably indispensable for the
lasting success of monetary union,' he told a German chamber of commerce
lunch. There was a risk Europe could 'take a step backwards' unless
politicians widened horizons towards extending the Maastricht Treaty fully
to the political sphere.
He stressed the importance of a 'common basis' of economic and fiscal
policies to make the plan work properly to move to a single currency by the
end of the 1990s.
Mr Tietmeyer rejected drawing up the list of countries to participate in Emu
on anything else except stringent economic criteria. There could be 'no
political assessment' of the eligibility of countries to join when the first
decisions on Emu are taken in 1996, he said.
Foreign holders of D-Marks would have to be assured that the new European
currency would be at least as stable as the D-Mark. 'Absolute assurance is
not possible in this world. For this you have to wait until heaven,' he
said, but did not, however, indicate whether he expected to wait so long for
Emu to be in place.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States
yesterday said that basic issues of finance, division of arms and agreement
on the draft for the coming year had remained unresolved between the CIS
governments after the summit meeting at Kiev last week.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov said that the budget for the armed forces -
except for the independent forces now being created in Ukraine and Moldova -
was now being met entirely by Russia, which had put up Rbs50bn for the first
quarter of the year. He said that Russia would have again to agree a budget
for the second quarter soon, since there had been no agreement from other
republics on contributions to the budget.
This would mean, he said, that Russia would take over command of 'certain
units', which he did not specify.
He said the formation of a separate Russian army under a Russian defence
ministry, announced last week and under the direct authority of Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, would not mean two commanders at the head of
the armed forces.
A peacekeeping force of 'observers' is to be formed to intervene in areas of
conflict, such as Nagorno-Karabakh and in the Trans Dnestr region in
Moldova.
This would exist outside of the CIS armed forces, and be formed from units
from various republics, he said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lawyers are innately conservative, but will they generally be voting for the
present administration at the general election?
Numerically, it may not matter. In this country there is still not quite the
proliferation of lawyers that pervades the public scene in the United
States. But British lawyers' voting habits may reflect the mood of the
professional classes as they go to the polls on April 9.
Historically, the training of lawyers was geared to the established order;
law reform was barely considered a separate subject for debate. The law
faculties of the older universities were once aptly described as 'encrusted
with heavy-footed traditionalists'.
But that is very much a thing of the past. The products of that age have
virtually disappeared from bench and bar. Today a student can choose to be
trained in law and expect to be an effective voice for human rights.
Even though the law graduate today is imbued with the idea of public
service, nevertheless the practising profession derives its profitability
from commercial clients. It is doubtful whether or not lawyers take their
'ethics, economics and political ideas from the banker'. Certainly, however,
there is a tendency for lawyers practising exclusively for City merchants to
take on the political leanings of their clients.
But there is more to the practice of law nowadays than acting for the
moneyed classes. The spread of legal practice into fields that concern not
property but human values has created a new brand of lawyer with political
attitudes that do not necessarily reflect his or her professional tag.
Lawyers have become more a part of the body politic. There is less evidence
of the progression from one monastic order to another: prep school to public
school to Oxbridge and on to the Temple.
Still, if heads had been counted, the profession would have been largely
putting its X against the Conservative candidate's name - at least until the
recent past.
Such a confident prediction would have been misplaced at any time since
1987. The assault upon the restrictive practices of the profession by the
Thatcher administration has produced some profound shifts in allegiance. A
moment's recounting of the recent history tells all.
When the Labour administration of the late 1970s set up the Royal Commission
on the legal profession under the chairmanship of Lord Benson, the
profession regarded the move predictably as the left's instinctive dislike
of the legal profession and its well-heeled members. It therefore set to,
and mounted a massive defence of its status in society and its practices.
When the Royal Commission reported, the profession got a virtual clean bill
of health. It consequently wallowed in its evident success and proceeded to
sit back and rest on its laurels.
The defeat of the Labour government in 1979 simply confirmed the view that
all was well, so long as there was no return of a Labour government. And
even that was not too unwelcome a prospect, since there would be little
likelihood of a rerun of Benson this side of the 21st century.
Imagine, therefore, the horror with which the proposals of the Lord
Chancellor were met after the 1987 election, resulting in the Courts and
Legal Services Act 1990. In the course of the parliamentary process, the
profession was able to chip away at some of the more radical reforms
proposed by Lord MacKay, but the legislation jolted the profession out of
its supposed immunity from the politician.
The revulsion expressed at this legislative monstrosity was led by the
higher judiciary, with the famous Friday debate in the House of Lords when
the Lord Chief Justice spoke vehemently against the proposals, using
language illustrative of the most vigorous assault on extreme
authoritarianism.
Although there has been some retreat from such outright opposition in the
last two years, the scars of the battle are still visible. What the
profession could not stomach was that all this was being done in the name of
the Conservative party.
It was not uncommon during the late 1980s to hear senior members of the
profession vowing that they would abandon their life-long allegiance to
Toryism. Some would abstain. Others were declared supporters of the Alliance
in 1987. It was particularly noticeable that The Independent had
increasingly become the daily newspaper fare in place of The Times,
reflecting a shift in political attitude.
Today it is not possible to predict how lawyers would vote in an actual
poll. Certainly the mould of natural alliance between lawyers and
right-of-centre politics (the profession rarely produced anyone on the
extreme right) has been broken.
While a majority of lawyers would tend to favour a party which protected
individual property rights, they would not all be fearful of a Labour
government. Perhaps that is as much a result of the Labour party moving
closer to the centre of politics than of disenchantment with the
Conservative party.
At least lawyers nowadays generally opt for the median - and that may mean a
vote for a candidate from any of the three parties, depending on the
parliamentary constituency.

FT  23 MAR 92 / International Company News: Institutional investor in
challenge to 10 groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the most influential institutional investors in the US has thrown
down a gauntlet to 10 of the US's largest companies - including American
Express, International Business Machines, and Time Warner - and threatened
to vote against the re-election of their directors if they do not pay more
attention to shareholders' interests.
The action represents a significant escalation of a campaign being waged by
activist investors in the US for better corporate governance - making
companies more responsive to the wishes of the shareholders who own them.
The threat comes from the California Public Employees Retirement System
(Calpers), the leading US public pension fund, which complained that the 10
either paid their top managers too much, had too few outsiders on their
boards, or failed to consider shareholders' interests when setting strategy.
The result was poor financial performance.
Calpers has emerged as the most aggressively activist of the US's large
institutional investors and in recent years has put down many reformist
resolutions to be voted on at companies' annual meetings, which tend to be
held between March and May in what is known as the 'proxy season'.
Last autumn, in a change of policy, Calpers said it would try to negotiate
behind the scenes with a dozen unnamed companies where it wanted to see
change, rather than engage in public confrontation during the proxy season.
Now, however, it has shifted its tactics again.
It said that two of the 12 companies - Ryder System and ITT Corporation -
had made changes along the lines it proposed but the other 10 had yet to do
so, while some had even refused to meet it.
Mr Dale Hanson, Calpers' chief executive, said that 'if we are unable to
reach agreement with the remaining 10 companies we may be forced to vote
'no' at the next election of directors'.
Many of the companies replied that Calpers' criticisms were unfounded or
being addressed. Calpers' aggression is deeply disliked by corporate America
and is controversial among institutional investors.

<TEXT>
MANDARIN Oriental, the Hong Kong-based luxury hotel arm of the Jardine
Matheson group, has announced a 17.3 per cent drop in net profit for 1992 to
Dollars 37.4m, compared with Dollars 45.2m in 1990.
This was the second consecutive earnings decline for Mandarin following a
10.3 per cent profits fall in 1990. Turnover in 1991 rose 3 per cent to
Dollars 127.2m.
Mr Robert Riley, managing director, said there had been an improvement in
the hotel market in the first two months of the year, with profitability at
a similar level to 1990. The 1991 figures were in line with expectations,
given the impact of the Gulf war, the increase in competition from luxury
hotels on Hong Kong island and the global recession.
The group's hotels in Hong Kong and Bangkok were hit hard last year, but
Manila, Jakarta and Macau succeeded in increasing profit contribution.
The company announced a final dividend of 3.59 cents per share, making a
full year pay-out of 5 cents, the same as 1992. The company also said it
would apply for a primary listing in London, if the Hong Kong Stock Exchange
goes ahead with changes to the secondary listing rules.

FT  23 MAR 92 / International Company News: Olympia &amp; York fails in bid to
secure Dollars 220m Japanese loan

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK, the Canadian property group controlled by the Reichmann
family, failed at the end of last year to raise Dollars 220m (Pounds 127m)
of long term funds from Japanese investors, it emerged yesterday.
Morgan Stanley, the US investment bank, was retained by O&amp;Y to secure the
finance from the Japanese. O&amp;Y believes that if Morgan had succeeded, it
would have avoided some of the adverse publicity it has recently received
about its financial position.
Mr Peter Rosenthal, a spokesman for O&amp;Y, said: 'Morgan Stanley only told us
they had failed to raise the funds at the very last minute in December. And
while that was not what triggered adverse publicity about O&amp;Y, it was
clearly a contributing factor.'
O&amp;Y is shortly to meet its bankers to discuss a possible reorganisation of
its huge borrowings.
Morgan said yesterday that it informed the Reichmanns in December that the
funds, which it had been retained to raise, would not be forthcoming because
of a lack of investor interest.
At around the same time, Morgan was exercising an option it had to sell to
O&amp;Y a building, 25 Cabot Square, that Morgan Stanley developed and owned at
O&amp;Y's Canary Wharf project. Morgan Stanley later brought a legal action
against O&amp;Y to force it to pay the Dollars 240m sale price of the building.
O&amp;Y said yesterday that Morgan Stanley's fundraising effort was 'designed to
raise finance for the sale' by Morgan to O&amp;Y.
But Morgan Stanley denies the link between the building's sale to O&amp;Y and
the Japanese fund-raising effort.
'While it is true we were retained by O&amp;Y to raise the funds from Japanese
and other investors, the sale (of the building) was not contingent on Morgan
Stanley arranging the financing for O&amp;Y,' a Morgan Stanley spokeswoman said.
Morgan Stanley has brought a UK legal claim against O&amp;Y to seek the Dollars
240m payment.
A UK court ruled in Morgan Stanley's favour earlier this month, but the
decision was stayed pending an appeal.
O&amp;Y said yesterday that it expected to make the Dollars 240m payment to
Morgan Stanley 'on or before June 30, 1992.'

FT  23 MAR 92 / UK insurers may face liquidation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROVISIONAL liquidators are today expected to be appointed to two insurance
companies under scrutiny by the Department of Trade and Industry for a
series of financial transactions with companies connected to Mr Rupert
Murdoch.
It is believed partners from accountants Price Waterhouse will be be
appointed by directors of Trinity Insurance and Bryanston Insurance, two
companies owned by GFA International, a holding company controlled by Mr
Grant Fowler, the Australian entrepreneur.
The action comes as DTI officials consider a report from accountants Ernst &amp;
Young submitted by the directors on the regulatory implications of a series
of transactions since early 1990 totalling at least Pounds 20m.
An official close to the investigation said yesterday these were 'not
suitable or usual for an insurance company'.
The report was commissioned by Mr John Winter, an accountant and company
doctor brought in by directors of the two companies in January this year
following the departure of Mr Fowler as chief executive.
Mr Winter declined to comment yesterday, but the report is believed to
document short-term loans worth Pounds 10m since 1990 to Trinity and
Bryanston by Cruden Investments and Kayarem, two companies within the
Murdoch family business empire which between them owned over 43 per cent of
News Corporation at the end of the last financial year.
It also shows outstanding loans of about Pounds 6m made in early 1990 by
Trinity and Bryanston to Panfida, the Australia-based group which owned the
Martin chain of newsagents and went into liquidation in January. News
Corporation held a 29.9 per cent stake in Panfida and also made loans
totalling Pounds 30m to Martin.
The report highlights a further Pounds 4m in loans to offshore companies,
most of which have been repaid. It says Mr Fowler is married to Penny
Calvert-Jones, Mr Murdoch's niece.
Trinity and Bryanston have become insolvent following large underwriting
losses, a lack of investment income and high operating expenses. The
directors of the two companies are seeking approval of creditors to propose
a scheme of arrangement in the High Court under insolvency law. About 120
staff are expected to be made redundant.

<TEXT>
THE State Bank of Pakistan, the country's central bank, has cancelled plans
to sell bearer bonds in the US and is deferring their sale in other
countries after fears the bonds could be used to launder drugs money.
The bank's advertisements for the foreign currency bearer certificates,
which appeared last week, said bondholders would not have to pay income tax
or wealth tax. The advertisements also said: 'No questions asked about
source of funds' and 'No identity to be disclosed'.
These ads prompted Senator John Kerry of Massachussetts to write to Mr Alan
Greenspan, chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, and Mr Richard Breeden,
head of the Securities and Exchange Commission, asking that the sale of the
bonds be stopped because they could be used to launder money. An aide to
Senator Kerry said the SEC was considering moves to prevent the sale of the
bonds in the US. It was also learned that Fed inspectors are examining
records at US branch offices of the National Bank of Pakistan.
A source at the Pakistan State Bank said yesterday the bonds, due to go on
sale today had been withdrawn from the US. The sale elsewhere had been
deferred to ensure compliance with local laws.
The bonds, denominated in US dollars, D-Marks, sterling and Yen, went on
sale in Pakistan on March 15.

FT  23 MAR 92 / FedEx wraps up its European dream: Nikki Tait reports on the
US courier's retreat to home base
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask an American to send you a small package overnight, and the chances are
he will suggest 'FedEx-ing' it. Make the same request in Europe, and the
sender might mutter anything from 'DHL', through a nationalised rail service
to a local courier.
This linguistic difference says much about the retreat from intra-European
business last week by America's largest express delivery company.
Memphis-based Federal Express has inveigled its way into US business life to
where it is part of the language. In Europe, it has conspicuously failed.
This has not been for want of money, effort or incentive. Faced with a
maturing domestic market, Federal Express has poured about Dollars 2.5bn
(Pounds 1.4bn) into international expansion since the mid-1980s, much of it
in Europe. Yet its international operating losses have spiralled from
Dollars 43m in 1988-89, to Dollars 391m in 1990-91. During the quarter to
end-February 1992 they reached Dollars 125m.
This demanded action, and rumours that FedEx would abandon intra-European
deliveries, or subcontract such services, have been rife for months. But now
the decision has been taken, three questions remain. Why did the strategy
fail? Will this retreat staunch the international losses?  And where will
retrenchment leave FedEx's longer-term strategy outside its home territory?
The company was born 20 years ago, when its founder, Mr Fred Smith, built up
a fleet of purple-painted aircraft and vans, and created a reliable US
overnight delivery market.
Today, up to 3m overnight packages are transported daily in the US, and
Federal Express commands about half the business. However, within a decade
of formation, FedEx was seeking new areas for expansion. It made one
disastrous foray into the facsimile business, with ZapMail. When that was
aborted in 1986, its attention shifted overseas.
Like much of its competition, Federal Express was attracted by Europe. The
1992 harmonisation measures were expected to ease customs and logistical
problems, while development of pan-European business organisations seemed
likely to boost demand.
FedEx bought its way into Europe with relatively small deals - including the
UK's Lex Wilkinson in 1986, and Littlewoods' Home Delivery Service in 1989.
But in 1988, it acquired Los Angeles-based Tiger International, the world's
largest air cargo carrier, for Dollars 880m.
This two-fold strategy appears to have been a mistake. According to an
analyst, it provoked 'all the classic problems of an American company
arriving in Europe'. FedEx attempted to stamp a single identity on disparate
European businesses, but failed to appreciate the difficulties of blending
local practices.
The European operations were largely ground-based, but FedEx mostly used air
transport. 'They couldn't combine successfully and found a low level of
synergy existed,' said Mr David Gutherie, an analyst at Morgan Keegan, the
Memphis brokerage.
Tiger, meanwhile, produced its own problems. The workforce was unionised
while FedEx's was not, and much of its customer base comprised
freight-forwarders - essentially competitors to FedEx. They were wary, and
integration was difficult.
Projections for European market growth were over-optimistic. Mr Tom Oliver,
head of FedEx's worldwide customer operations, estimated last week that the
intra-European overnight market was 100,000 packets a day - a trickle
compared with the US.
Competitors, notably Connecticut-based United Parcel Service, were
determined to move in, while Brussels-based DHL and Australia's TNT provided
established competition. 'Current capacity could service 150 per cent of
what is being projected for the year 2,000', said Mr Paul Schlesinger at
Donaldson, Lufkin &amp; Jenrette.
FedEx's retrenchment will cost 6,600 jobs, involve subcontracting
intra-European deliveries outside 16 major cities, and confine FedEx to a
direct service between the US and these points.
In theory, this should stem some operating losses. But analysts are not
optimistic - reflected in FedEx's share price which ended the week Dollars 3
lower at Dollars 51 1/4 .
Federal Express's finance director, Mr Alan Graf, declined to say how much
of last quarter's deficit could be attributed to intra-European business.
FedEx warned it was 'unable to predict with certainty whether the announced
restructuring will reverse the existing trend of increasing international
losses', although it predicted recovery in 1993.
The company claims the 16-city service will mean it delivers about 45 per
cent of its European packages itself - with all the 'quality control'
advantages this implies. As the retrenchment was being announced, FedEx
wrote to its US customers, explaining that the Express freighter service -
offering speedy intercontinental service - would expand to Paris and Milan.
Mr Oliver also said that while FedEx was 'not happy with revenues out of
Asia', the market is different from Europe, and no radical overhaul is
planned.
Yet, should demand for overnight delivery in Europe grow in future,
re-entering the market will not be easy. Clearly, the major remaining
players - DHL, TNT, and UPS - will take every advantage of FedEx's
retrenchment.
'It's a fine line,' suggested Mr Schlesinger, 'between a strategy they can't
afford, and a strategy that's essential to the long-term well-being.'

FT  23 MAR 92 / An Irish model for Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE YOU worried about a hung parliament? Afraid of electoral reform? Nervous
about sterling? Just plain sick of the election? A good cure for these
common complaints, as I discovered last week, is a visit to Dublin. It is
not only as enjoyable as ever, but unexpectedly educational. Reassuring,
even.
Ireland has a weak economy - for the moment at any rate - and some major
financial scandals. It has recently dumped a charismatic prime minister; and
thanks to proportional representation, it has a more or less permanently
hung parliament. Yet over the past few years it has wrought some astonishing
changes. It has reduced the government deficit from 13 per cent to 2 1/2 per
cent of GDP; and plans to eliminate it altogether. It has achieved a large
trade surplus, and pushed inflation down from the high teens to under 3 per
cent. It is hard to resist repeating one of the great journalistic
misjudgments of all time, and say: 'I have seen the future, and it works.'
Only up to a point, as we will see.
What does work, though in a rather Irish fashion, is coalition government;
it can get you into the most terrible trouble, but it can also get you out
again. What it takes is a sufficient sense of national crisis; given that, a
strong leader seems able to get away with anything. Mr Charles Haughey seems
to have modelled his conduct on that of Governor Huey Long of Louisiana, who
won an election by promising to cut taxes and promptly raised them as soon
as he was back in the governor's mansion. An aide asked him how this should
be explained to the press. 'Tell them I lied,' said the governor; and he got
away with it. Mr Haughey won his last election but one by denouncing the
painful squeeze which has been mounted by Mr Garret Fitzgerald, then Fine
Gael leader; but as soon as he took office, he mounted a still fiercer one,
and with opposition support. It was not very long before he felt
(mistakenly) strong enough to call an election in the hope of winning a
working majority. He is now a senior victim of the financial scandals; but
his successor, the pragmatic Mr Albert Reynolds, is following the same
fiscal strategy. Consensus rules.
The success which has formed this consensus is especially interesting from a
British point of view: the totally successful unilateral devaluation of
1986. This had almost none of the bad effects we are taught to expect. There
was a shortlived spike in interest rates, but that is all. Unit costs
remained under tight control, and the competitiveness gained six years ago
has not only been sustained, but enhanced.
In spite of a boom in output, which has now fizzled out, inflation went on
falling, even in this very open economy. This is because the policies
required to make devaluation work - a fiscal squeeze, and a consensus on
wage restraint - were already in place. After a hiccup, it was even possible
to sell ever-rising amounts of Irish government securities to German
investors, at quite a modest yield premium. The whole history is a model of
how ERM disciplines are supposed to work.
The Irish are now intensely interested in our own election, though not in a
partisan way; the outcome they most fear is one the City might welcome - a
Conservative government depending on Unionist support. They are also, not
surprisingly, intensely nervous about sterling. Given their own experience,
devaluation looks an obvious policy option; but a sharp move - certainly one
which put the Irish punt at a premium to the pound - would put them in a
painful dilemma. To be sure, all British parties publicly reject the option;
but you don't have to be Governor Long to lie about the parity.
Politics apart, though, the case is not cut and dried. Ireland has one bit
of luck which will not fall to the next British government: the D-Mark was
an almost ideal anchor for the system in the late 1980s. Germany had low
inflation, low interest rates, and was a large-scale capital exporter. That
is now sadly changed, of course, and the present German profligacy faces
fellow-member of the ERM with the unpalatable choice neatly summed up by
Brian Reading in a Lombard Street circular this month: imitate German fiscal
profligacy, or grin and bear a long economic depression. Possibly both.
In one sense that argues for devaluation: if you know you are going to have
the hangover, in the form of high real interest rates, you might as well
enjoy the drink. But in another it argues against it: the deterioration in
German cost performance, as well as the improvement in British, means that
it is now quite realistic to hope that we can go on gaining competitiveness
without changing the parity.
It is a difficult judgment: how far is sterling overvalued at the moment,
and how long will it take to adjust? If this was simply a British decision,
I would support sticking to the parity, while cursing those who chose it;
but the judgment may not be left to us. At the moment Dublin's worries seem
to be largely local; but should they become widespread - as a result, say,
of a new deterioration in our trade performance - they would be hard to
resist.
And probably not worth resisting. A British devaluation might work almost as
well as Ireland's. The private sector squeeze on costs and borrowing is
every bit as fierce as any government policy, and is not a prey to political
whims.
Indeed, in an important sense the Irish strategy would be more appropriate
for Britain than it is for Ireland. The present Irish figures are an amazing
achievement of political will power, but possibly a perverse one. The
current account surplus means that Ireland, which has a tragic unemployment
problem, is now exporting capital as well as labour, hardly the appropriate
balance for an under-developed country.
This is partly the result of a mistaken industrial policy. Foreign companies
attracted to Ireland by low corporate taxes use transfer pricing to generate
profits which are lent on to more highly taxed subsidiaries elsewhere. But
for Britain, free of such distortions, and still a temporary oil producer, a
strategy aimed at a sustained current account surplus really could be
counted an unambiguous success.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Tatarstan vote for self-rule poses challenge to Yeltsin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin faces a challenge to the preservation of his vast
Russian Federation following the weekend vote for self-rule by the oil-rich
autonomous republic of Tatarstan.
The 61.4 per cent majority for self-rule in Saturday's vote was decisive
enough to embarrass the Russian government, especially Mr Yeltsin, who
warned last week that the vote was 'aimed at isolation from Russia', and
constituted a dangerous step that would delay Russian reforms.
Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, the Tatar president, has denied his republic aims to
break away from Russia. But Tatarstan is now likely to demand more economic
and legislative autonomy than Russia can allow if it is not to set an
awkward precedent.
The vote came the day after a summit of the Commonwealth of Independent
States (CIS), which ended in acrimony and underlined the weak links holding
ex-Soviet republics together.
Mr Yeltsin's problem was underscored by the 37.2 per cent vote against Tatar
self-rule, reflecting the influence of local Russians. These make up 42 per
cent of the inhabitants and in Kazan, the capital, which has a Russian
majority, the 'no' vote was 51 per cent.
Russian first deputy premier Gennady Burbulis yesterday warned Tatarstan not
to break away. 'We cannot allow ourselves to be indifferent to what is known
as the territorial integrity of Russia,' he said on television.
Mr Yeltsin's press office said the signing of a federative treaty between
Moscow and 18 of the 20 autonomous republics had been postponed until March
31 because of 'organisational problems'.
It was due to be concluded with a ceremony on Wednesday. But both Tatarstan
and the Chechen republic - which has already declared independence - have
refused to sign it, while the parliaments of the other republics have either
still to approve it or have approved it only with amendments to be
negotiated.
The Russian constitution, of which the treaty would be a central part, is
due to come before the next session of the Russian Congress of Peoples'
Deputies starting on April 6. Many voices in that Congress and in the
Russian leadership will seek strong measures against Tatarstan.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Poll blow for French Socialists: Defeat for ruling party
confirms slide in Cresson's popularity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE'S ruling Socialists suffered a humiliating defeat in yesterday's
regional elections, losing well over a third of their popular support.
The party appeared likely to have got less than 19 per cent of the vote,
according to exit polls and partial results - compared with 30 per cent in
the previous regional elections of 1986. The Socialists' setback was even
worse when compared with the last French parliamentary elections of 1988,
when they got 36 per cent.
Mrs Edith Cresson, the prime minister, discounted the results, pointing out
that 'no absolute majority' had emerged from the vote. But the election is
widely expected to be a turning point for the government, since it confirms
the steep slide in Mrs Cresson's popularity since she was appointed last
May.
It will be hard for President Francois Mitterrand to ignore the result, and
many commentators have predicted he will have to change his prime minister
or even the entire government.
However, the overall message was not just a swingeing setback for the
Socialists but a sweeping rejection of all traditional parties of
government.
As expected, the big innovation of the election was a double breakthrough by
two protest groups, the extreme right-wing National Front and the ecology
movements.
The National Front, led by Mr Jean-Marie Le Pen, got an estimated 12.5 per
cent of the national vote. This appears to confirm France out as the country
with the strongest extreme right-wing party in western Europe.
The two ecological parties, the Greens and Generation Ecologie, got a
combined 14 per cent. The Greens, led by Mr Antoine Waechter got 7.6 per
cent, while Generation Ecologie, led by Mr Brice Lalonde, got 6.4 per cent.
The traditional conservative parties, the centre-right UDF umbrella grouping
and the Gaullist RPR party, also suffered a significant erosion of their
popular support, even though they came out well ahead of the Socialists with
a combined score estimated at about 33-34 per cent.
This was significantly down on their score in the 1988 parliamentary
elections (nearly 38 per cent) or the 1986 regional elections (nearly 40 per
cent). Their failure to gain any votes from the discredited Socialists is a
serious psychological blow.
In practical terms the Socialists' defeat is mainly indirect, because the
direct significance of the elections is confined to France's 22 regional
councils. Since the decentralisation policy of 1982, these have received
extra powers over certain aspects of local policy.
The traditional conservative parties controlled 19 of the 22 regions in the
outgoing regional council, and they have done considerably better than the
Socialists yesterday. But the breakthrough by the protest parties may make
it much more difficult for them to mobilise new governing majorities.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Letters To The Editor: Gatt plan and quantity conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL TRACY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article 'German proposals may save next round of Gatt' (March
18) your correspondents in Bonn and Washington refer to Chancellor Kohl's
initiative aiming at a freeze on US exports of cereal substitutes to the
European Community and, in return, quantity restriction on EC agricultural
exports.
While it is desirable that level of EC agricultural export subsidies should
be reduced, quantity restrictions are quite another matter.
This will inevitably lead to conflicts between member states - how much
French wheat should get subsidy, as against how much British barley. . ? The
next step would be the introduction of quantitative controls over grain
production, provoking interminable and probably insoluble political and
administrative difficulties.
This approach might indeed suit Germany, which wants to keep a high-price
Common Agricultural Policy corseted by supply controls, but it is the wrong
path to 'reform'; price cuts as envisaged in the MacSharry Plan, with
degressive income compensation to farmers, are the right way.
It would be paradoxical if the outcome of trade liberalisation were to be an
even more highly-regulated CAP.

FT  23 MAR 92 / A price-tag on the promises: Martin Wolf examines the
Conservative party's criticism of Labour's hidden agenda for increased
public spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST WEEK saw the battle of the two main parties' plans for taxation. On
Saturday, the Conservative party shifted its focus towards Labour's plans
for public spending. Labour's manifesto, it claimed, has 37 policy pledges
that would cost an extra Pounds 37.9bn annually by the last year of a full
parliament, in current prices.
These charges and counter-charges are at the heart of the election campaign.
The Conservative party seems to have abandoned hope of convincing the voters
that a fourth term would do them much good. Instead, it seeks to frighten
them about Labour's harmful intentions. So is John Smith the sober and
responsible chancellor-in-waiting that he appears to be? Or is he, as the
Conservatives argue, the respectable face of the spendthrift socialist
tiger?
Whatever the truth, Mr Smith has been winning the battle of appearances. In
his shadow budget, presented last week, he promised to raise additional net
revenue of Pounds 3.3bn in 1992-93 (half a percentage point of gross
domestic product) and Pounds 6.8bn in 1993-94 (one percentage point of GDP),
by comparison with the budget presented by Norman Lamont. The Conservatives
wished to make these proposals appear threatening to a substantial
proportion of the electorate. They have failed.
As the Institute of Fiscal Studies has pointed out, 48 per cent of the
population would be better off under the Labour budget than under that of
the Conservatives, 35 per cent would be in roughly the same position, while
only 17 per cent would be better off under the Conservatives. The majority
of the electorate would, therefore, either be unaffected by these proposals
or - especially if they were on below average incomes and were either
pensioners or parents - would benefit substantially.
The Labour budget may be harshly criticised for the shock it would impose on
the higher paid and for its longer term effect on incentives. But since each
adult has one vote in an election, it looks politically invulnerable. The
more Conservatives focus their attack on Mr Smith's shadow budget, the more
a majority of voters is likely to appreciate the transfers proposed.
The Conservatives need a knock-out punch. The campaign against Labour's
wider spending plans is to be that punch. The items they enumerate in
support of their case against Labour profligacy include commitments to:
increased basic pensions, costed at Pounds 2,700m;
equalisation of pension age at 60, costed at Pounds 3,000m;
uprating of pensions in line with earnings, costed at Pounds 2,100m;
improved and extended invalid allowances, costed at Pounds 2,140m;
disability benefits, costed at Pounds 1,300m;
increased child benefit, costed at Pounds 730m;
increased spending on National Health Service, costed at Pounds 3,000m;
increased investment in housing, costed at Pounds 3,000m;
a high-speed rail network linking every region to the Channel Tunnel, costed
at Pounds 3,000m;
improved public transport for London, costed at Pounds 550m;
increase in share of GDP spent on education to 1979 level, costed at Pounds
2,600m;
reaching the aid target of 0.7 per cent of GDP, costed at Pounds 2,500m;
increased powers for local authorities, costed at Pounds 3,000m;
implementation of the European Social Charter, costed at Pounds 600m; and
improved public sector pay and conditions, and introduction of a statutory
minimum wage, costed at Pounds 3,600m.
To this lengthy list, the Conservatives add another 22 items, costed at
Pounds 4,075m, ranging all the way from improved legal aid (Pounds 115m), to
increased spending on training (Pounds 200m), via free eye tests (Pounds
165m) and funeral payments (Pounds 80m).
Yet what Mr Smith has definitively proposed would be an increase in public
spending of only Pounds 6.8bn in 1993-94. Specified items would be the
increase in the weekly state retirement pension by Pounds 5 for a single
person and Pounds 8 for a couple, costing Pounds 2.3bn in a full year, and
the increase in child benefit to Pounds 9.95 for all children, costing
Pounds 750m in a full year. The Pounds 3.5bn left over from the shadow
chancellor's proposed increase in net taxation would then go on health,
education 'and other vital public services'.
Included in Mr Smith's sums are immediate implementation of a Pounds 1.1bn
'Recovery Programme', embracing:
enhanced first year capital allowances in manufacturing;
measures to help small business;
a new skills fund and restoration of cuts in Employment Training and Youth
Training;
a job experience programme for the unemployed;
phased release of capital receipts held by local authorities from the sale
of council houses; and
a pilot leasing programme for British Rail.
How plausible, against this, is the Conservative complaint of a
not-so-hidden Labour party spending agenda? That Labour has intentions in
all the areas listed by the Conservatives - some more, some less specific -
is clear. But many of the costings must be doubted. Would increased powers
for local authorities, for example, really cost Pounds 3bn? Would improved
public sector pay and the implementation of the national minimum wage cost
Pounds 3.6bn? Would a high speed rail link to the Channel Tunnel cost Pounds
3bn in a single year in the life of the next parliament? None of these
numbers looks compelling.
Nevertheless, Conservative charges cannot be ignored. Labour has many
commitments in its programme and they will cost money. Where might it come
from? Could Labour rely on the 'growth dividend' to fund substantial further
increases in public spending? The plausible answer is 'no'. If Mr Smith goes
to the Treasury cupboard, he is likely to find that it is already bare.
The charts give the background, including forecasts based on the Financial
Statement and Budget Report of 1992-93. The government's forecasts imply an
increase in the share of non-north sea taxation in GDP, as the recovery
takes hold. The current rise in public spending as a share of GDP is
explained in large measure by the recession, as was the case in the
mid-1970s and early 1980s. Nevertheless, the share of public spending in GDP
would remain below levels reached between 1973-74 and 1986-87. The ratio is
also expected to fall after 1993-94, but the public sector borrowing
requirement will still not go below 3 per cent of GDP, the benchmark level
agreed at Maastrich for the path to economic and monetary union, before
1995-96.
What then might be the effect of a Labour government? Suppose, first, that
Labour only increased public spending and taxation by the amounts already
announced, plus the notional tax reductions pencilled in by the government
for 1995-96 and 1996-97. The result, as shown. would be only modestly above
the government's forecasts.
Suppose, second, that the Conservatives were right about Labour's agenda. On
the Treasury's assumption about economic growth, public spending would rise
to at least 46 per cent of GDP. This is, it should be noted, no implausible
figure. The burden would then still be lower than in both the mid-1970s and
the early 1980s. But it would be at least 6 percentage points higher than
the Conservatives forecast, possibly optimistically, for themselves.
Nothing suggests that recovery would be faster under Labour than the
Conservatives. Neither is the economy likely to do better than the Treasury
now forecasts: economic growth at an average of 3 per cent a year between
1991-92 and 1996-97 period. This is as fast as the recovery from the last
recession, even though there is to be no sterling devaluation this time,
while real interest rates are high and the personal sector remains highly
indebted.
Even with such a recovery, public spending at 46 per cent of GDP by 1996-97
would not prove consistent with the Maastricht target, which is for a public
deficit of 3 per cent of GDP in a normal year, absent tax increases. Without
the government's proposed tax cuts in 1995-96 and 1996-97, but with Mr
Smith's proposed tax increases, general government receipts would be about
40 1/2 per cent of GDP in 1996-97, on the Treasury assumptions for economic
growth. This would imply an overall deficit - under full implementation of
Labour promises, as costed by the Conservatives - of 5-6 per cent of GDP.
To reduce that deficit to the target of 3 per cent of GDP would require not
the tax increases that the Conservative are suggesting, but perhaps half
that amount. The reason for the difference is that the Conservatives say
they want to lower the borrowing requirement to  3/4 per cent of GDP by
1996-97, while Labour might stick to the Maastricht 3 per cent.
Nevertheless, even with the hoped for recovery, Labour could not implement
all its dreams without extra taxation of perhaps 2-3 per cent of GDP,
equivalent to 6p on the basic rate of tax.
Yet this is far from the worst possibility. What would happen if real
economic growth were to average only 2 per cent over the next five years,
not 3 per cent? Other things equal, revenue in 1996-97 might then be more
than Pounds 15bn less than is now forecast by the Treasury for that year.
Even ignoring the effects of lower growth on public spending itself, that
would mean a PSBR at about 3 per cent of GDP. For a Labour party trying to
meet all of its aspirations, the deficit might be 7-8 per cent of GDP.
Underneath the smoke is a genuine battle. On plausible assumptions, the
growth dividend may have already been fully spoken for by the government. If
growth does not pick up as hoped, it may be impossible to enjoy increases in
government spending above those already planned, without breaching the limit
agreed at Maastricht. Even if growth were to be as fast as hoped, Labour
might still have to choose between all the spending it desires and higher
taxes.
If Labour were determined to spend substantially more in real terms than it
has already announced in its shadow budget, further tax increases do,
indeed, look likely. Alternatively, Labour supporters will end up
discontented. Conservative charges may be wildly aimed, but they are not
entirely off the mark.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Clucas and the consumer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME four years after the UK's Financial Services Act came fully into force,
Sir Kenneth Clucas has recommended radical changes in the regulation of
retail investment. His report suggests the merger of Fimbra and Lautro, the
self-regulatory organisations representing independent advisers and company
representatives, and comes only a week after the publication of the
Securities and Investments Board's (SIB) own controversial plan to force
life assurance companies to disclose more details of their costs to
prospective buyers.
The resignation of Mr Tim Miller from the board of Lautro is a reminder of
the continuing tensions. Mr Miller, who is marketing director of the unit
trust giant M &amp; G, was protesting at the loss of a battle over whether life
companies should be able to project future returns on the basis of their
actual own costs or of industry average costs. The SIB is content that life
offices will have to disclose their own costs in a slightly different form.
Haphazard historical development has given life companies big advantages
over unit trust groups in terms of the ability to use high-pressure sales
methods and to hide their true product costs. Endless complications have
developed over the attempts to devise equivalent regulation of the two
distinct sales channels used by life companies, direct sales forces and
independent financial advisers (IFAs).
Power balance
IFAs have demanded equivalent privileges to avoid full or 'hard' commission
disclosure, despite their claimed role as independent advisers to their
clients. They were given their own regulatory body, but it has proved not to
be financially viable. In deciding that it should be rolled up with Lautro,
Sir Kenneth Clucas has added a proposal for maintaining an elaborate balance
of power within the new agency to ensure that both salesmen and IFAs are
fairly treated. But even so there is obvious scope for bitter internal
arguments.
The story of retail investment regulation is one of slow progress. The issue
of independence has never been properly grasped: truly independent advisers
who took their clients fully into their confidence would not need, or even
want, to be treated like salesmen. But of course the latter have been
greatly assisted by the opaque nature of most life products and marketing
techniques.
Now the SIB is at last insisting that a measure of disclosure of
company-specific costs must be given to the client at the point of sale.
This should ensure an eventual end to the scandal that some life products
are successfully sold by sales forces even though the costs are up to three
times the average; such policies represent very poor value to the consumer.
Disclosure of high penalties for early surrender should also reduce the
notorious tendency for life salesmen to oversell unsuitable products to
clients who are unlikely to keep up the payments.
Public interest
But why is it all taking so long? The decision to rely mainly on
practitioners to operate the regulatory system under the Financial Services
Act always posed the problem of how the public interest could be properly
represented. The SIB has chosen to seek some kind of a consensus, and has
therefore found it hard to cope when heavy lobbying has been conducted by
investment industry interests and the consumers' point of view has been less
forcefully put. In wholesale markets, where the various interests tend to be
better balanced, the problems do not appear to have been so deep-rooted,
although again the general public interest may not get a proper hearing.
With political change in the air there is again discussion of whether the UK
needs a US-style SEC. This may be a red herring, and even the Labour party
has stopped talking about purely statutory solutions.
Yet over time, as the regulators gain in experience and self-confidence, it
would be natural to expect the influence of the practitioners to fade away
and the public interest, rather than convenient compromises, to be more
consistently pursued.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Engineers are urged to declare 'war on wear'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NATIONAL campaign being launched today is intended to save British
manufacturing industry Pounds 1.5bn a year by encouraging greater awareness
of one of engineering's more arcane 'ologies' - tribology, which is the
study of friction, lubrication and wear.
The Tribology Action Campaign, which comes with a self-help support package,
telephone helpline and regional workshops aims to declare 'war on wear' and
promote the application of the science across all areas of design,
production and operation.
The campaign, organised by the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, is
supported by the Department of Trade and Industry and sponsored by companies
ranging from British Coal to RHP Bearings and Silkolene Lubricants.
The aim is to reduce wear and tear in machinery through greater control of
friction. The projected annual savings of Pounds 1.5bn come from improved
efficiency through reduced energy, labour, maintenance and machinery costs.
The Institution of Mechanical Engineers said additional benefits included
reduced pollution and the potential to cut industrial energy consumption by
up to 10 per cent a year.
Mr Brian Halligan, campaign chairman and a member of the council of the
institution, said research commissioned by the organisation showed 75 per
cent of UK industry threw 'money down the drain' through lack of awareness.
He added: 'UK industry spends Pounds 8bn a year on maintaining direct
production assets. Yet, at any one time, 50 per cent of its machines are in
need of attention.'

FT  23 MAR 92 / Coupon conflict in food stores
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FULL-SCALE price war may not yet have broken out in the UK grocery sector
 -but a fierce coupon conflict certainly has. In the last few days the
Leeds-based Asda chain has raised the tempo by launching a spoiling campaign
designed to undermine their rivals' promotions.
The saga started last year when Tesco announced amid controversy that it
would redeem all other retailers' coupons.
So, for example, if a competitor ran a promotion campaign in local
newspapers and magazines offering 20p off its washing powder, then Tesco
promised to give an equivalent discount on one of its products once the
shopper had produced a rival's coupon.
The move was criticised by Tesco's competitors and some food manufacturers
which argued that it detracted from their marketing initiative and confused
shoppers. But, as the complaints subsided, some of Tesco's rivals such as J.
Sainsbury and the co-opera-tive societies followed the move.
Asda has now called their bluff by targeting two areas of the country where
it does not have any stores, dropping leaflets through letter-boxes offering
Pounds 10 off every Pounds 20 spent at one of its stores.
Asda said: 'The obvious intention was that somebody else would redeem them.
This is a slightly tongue-in-cheek gesture, but our competitors seem to be
taking it very seriously.'

FT  23 MAR 92 / Japanese group to buy County Hall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONTRACT for the sale of County Hall, the empty headquarters of the former
Greater London Council, to a Japanese company, will be signed today, Mr
Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, announced yesterday.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday he was
'outraged' that the London Residuary Body (LRB), the organisation
responsible for winding up the affairs of the GLC since its 1986 abolition,
intends to sell County Hall to Shirayama Corporation, a private Japanese
company, for development into a hotel and leisure centre.
Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, said yesterday that the sale
'will signal that the government has given up hopes of winning the
election'. He added: 'It appears to be sabotage against a future Labour
government's hopes to keep the building in the public sector.'
Mr Heseltine said: 'The LRB has a duty to secure the best price it can for
the assets of the former GLC and Ilea (Inner London Education Authority). I
was aware that the negotiations were reaching a conclusion, but I decided
that it would not be approriate for me to intervene.'
He stressed that the contract contained an option which would allow the next
government not to proceed to completion. The LRB offered the buildings, on
the south bank of the Thames near Westminster Bridge, for sale in 1990 after
following the abolition of Ilea, County Hall's last tenant.
The London School of Economics, which is believed to have offered about
Pounds 100m for the main building and three smaller neighbouring buildings,
said yesterday: 'We were assured by the Department of the Environment that
nothing would be finalised until after the election'.
Planning permission is available for the site only if all four buildings are
developed. Shirayama is believed to be interested only in the main building,
for which it is understood to have bid Pounds 60m.
Mr Mark Fisher, Labour arts spokesman, recently welcomed the LSE's plans for
County Hall. 'It is important that we regard the use of the site as a matter
of public gain and not private profit,' he said.
Mr Kenneth Clarke, education secretary, has also been sympathetic to a sale
of the buildings to the LSE. But Sir Godfrey Taylor, chairman of the LRB, is
understood to have favoured a sale to the private sector. Proceeds from any
sale will be redistributed amongst London's boroughs.
Shirayama has seven employees and is capitalised at Y100m (Pounds 43m).
It owns land in Osaka and in 1989 acquired a Madrid hotel for Pounds 48m
from Bass. It participated in a previous bid for County Hall.

FT  23 MAR 92 / VAT may apply to more snacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORTILLA CHIPS, pistachio nuts in their shells, packets of poppadums and
other savoury snacks may become liable for value added tax.
A consultation paper issued by HM Customs and Excise calls for a
comprehensive review of the VAT exemption of savoury snacks. VAT is paid on
potato crisps and salted peanuts, but many of the more exotic nibbles
introduced in the last few years fall outside the legal definition of what
constitutes a snack.
The Customs paper does not specify that VAT will be extended, but says that
if the borderline between snacks and food is made 'too generous' it could
lead to 'an unacceptable loss of revenue' and increase distortion of
competition.
Mr Keith Nightingale, director-general of the Snack, Nut and Crisp
Manufacturers' Association, said snacks incurred far lower VAT rates in many
other EC countries than in the UK, and called for them to be zero-rated.
Tax on snacks was first levied in 1969.

<TEXT>
ORDERS and deliveries among members of Bradford's Chamber of Commerce have
fallen in the first quarter of this year, Ian Hamilton Fazey writes. The
West Yorkshire town's chamber says its domestic and export markets have been
hit.
Balance figures - the difference between the percentage of companies
reporting rises and those reporting declines - showed sharp changes of
trend.
The balance for home deliveries fell to 5 percentage points from 13 points
in the last quarter of last year, while the balance for home orders was
minus 2 points, compared with plus 9 points.
Export deliveries were just positive at 1 percentage point, but this
compared with 19 points in the last survey. Export orders were affected even
more, the balance falling to zero from 19.
The survey covered 202 member compaies of the Bradford chamber, spread
mainly across textiles, engineering, chemicals, printing, packaging,
construction and freight forwarding. They employ more than 16,000 people
between them.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Factoring commended
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES which make use of factoring grow faster than non-users, according
to a survey for the Association of British Factors and Discounters. It finds
little difference in profitability between the two groups.
Its survey, Small Business Finance and the Role of Factoring, did not show
that users performed better than non-users, but the association hopes the
finding that they perform as well will help dispel factoring's image as a
form of finance used by compan-ies which are in difficul-ties.
The survey found that users of factoring had lower net margins than
non-users, partly because of the fees charged by factors, but the faster
rate of growth compensated for that.
The researchers compared the results of 200 companies which used factoring
or invoice discounting and the same number of non-users.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Biggest retailing chains increase joint market share
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECESSION has speeded up the concentration of retailing power in the UK,
according to a report from Corporate Intelligence Group, the retail
consultants.
The 10 biggest retailers now account for more than a third of all sales, and
have added 2 percentage points to their combined market share over the past
year. The top 500 retailers account for 70 per cent of all sales, leaving
240,000 independent companies with the remainder.
The report says this level of concentration suggests that many sectors have
oligopolies, in which trading is dominated by a small number of companies
rather than one, as in a monopoly.
The top six grocery retailers account for 75 per cent of food sales, the top
three DIY chains command 48.5 per cent of the home-improvement market, and
the leading four off-licence groups control 57 per cent of sales of
alcoholic drinks.
The report supports a widespread view in the industry that the big multiple
retailers, many of which are publicly quoted, are polarising between the
strong and the weak.
Although the 10 top retailers increased their sales by 55.3 per cent between
1986 and last year, the next 90 biggest retailers saw their sales increase
by only 19.1 per cent over the same period. The average growth rate for all
retailers was 34.2 per cent.
The report suggests that middle-ranking multiple chains are being squeezed
between the bigger efficiencies and economies of scale enjoyed by the
biggest chains and the greater flexibility of the smaller chains.
However, the report accepts that such figures are to some extent affected by
the large number of big chains which traditionally enjoy resilient sales,
even in recessions.
The top 10 retailers include seven companies which sell food. In order of
sales they are J. Sainsbury, Tesco, Marks and Spencer, Asda, Argyll (which
owns Safeway), Isosceles (which owns Gateway) and the John Lewis Partnership
(which owns Waitrose).
In comparison, the next 90 companies include many retailers selling clothing
and household goods. Such items are more exposed to volatile discretionary
spending and have been squeezed harder in the downturn.
The severity of the recession on retailers' profitability is borne out by
the report, which shows that in 1987-88 only 50 retailers with sales of more
than Pounds 3m made losses that year. By 1990-91 that figure had trebled to
140.
However, the frenetic pace of mergers and acquisitions that characterised
the retail sector in the 1980s has abated. In 1989 the value of acquisitions
in the sector amounted to Pounds 5.3bn. This fell sharply to Pounds 621.8m
in the following year, and grew only marginally to Pounds 706.4m last year.

<TEXT>
OVER tea and Border tart in Coldstream's Candy's Cafe, Mrs Peggy Allan
assesses her allegiance in the devolution debate.
Every Friday Mrs Allan travels from her home in Cornhill on Tweed, in
England, across the bridge to Coldstream in Scotland to visit the
hairdresser and the cafe.
Like most Cornhill residents, the Allans are registered with Coldstream GP.
When they go shopping for larger items they travel to Kelso in Scotland,
where their daughter lives.
'I look more to Scotland than I do to England,' says Mrs Allan. 'You feel
you're part of Scotland.' Talk of independence for Scotland upsets her.
'You'd lose part of your heritage. I wouldn't like it at all - I think we'd
move to this side.'
Mrs Jenny Waite, Mrs Allan's sister-in-law, feels differently. 'I think the
Scots are the poor relations,' she says, citing the recent closure of the
Ravenscraig steelworks. She would favour devolution 'if Scotland could stand
on its own feet'.
Mrs Waite and her husband Alec have lived in Coldstream for 30 years,
although Mr Waite is from Cornhill on Tweed. He supports Newcastle United
football team, but 'if Scotland are playing football against England it's
Scotland he wants to win', says Mrs Waite.
Cafe proprietor Mrs Madge Scott and her business partner Ms Kathleen Lees,
both Scottish, feel that if Scotland became independent a rigid border post
between Coldstream and Cornhill on Tweed would be 'ridiculous', given the
links between the two communities. But they do support a degree of
devolution for Scotland.
'We definitely need a bigger say,' says Mrs Scott. 'A lot of people would
really like total independence but I don't think the country's rich enough.'
Politically, Coldstream is complex. Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat
Treasury spokesman, is defending the seat, while Berwickshire district
council is dominated by the Tories, and its representative on the Borders
regional council, Mr Donald Moffat, is a Scottish Nationalist. His call for
independence is not anti-English, he says. 'In the Borders anything up to a
third of SNP members are English.'
A handsome 18th-century stone bridge links Coldstream (population 1,800)
with Cornhill on Tweed (population 306). For many residents of Cornhill on
Tweed the bridge is a lifeline to important services, including the
hospitals to which their Scottish GPs refer them, as well as banks, chemists
and chip shops. Cornhill on Tweed does have its own sub-post office, but the
mail is sorted in Scotland and brought over the bridge. The village's
telephones, all with a Coldstream code, are routed through BT's Galashiels
exchange. Electricity also comes from Scotland.
But the education system highlights the differences. Although Mrs Julie
Grainger, the Northumberland-born head of the school in Cornhill on Tweed,
lives in Scotland, she doubts she could get a comparable job there. She is
not registered with the Scottish General Teaching Council as she trained in
England.
English and Scottish news-papers are displayed with equal prominence in the
Cornhill on Tweed village shop, and the same customers buy both. The till
has a special section for Scottish Pounds 1 notes, and the shop's stock
includes Tweedside honey from Berwick-upon-Tweed and meat pies from
Coldstream.
'I'd say I'm a Borderer,' says Mrs Mary Black, the shop assistant, who lives
in Cornhill on Tweed but was born in Coldstream. Her colleague, Mrs
Catherine Telford, who lives in Coldstream, concurs. 'We think of ourselves
as Borderers. We are one.'
But there has not always been this sense of unity. The English and the Scots
fought bloody battles for control of the border lands, and just two miles
from Cornhill on Tweed is Flodden Field, where in 1513 the Scots armies of
James IV were destroyed by the English. A commemorative stone cross on the
site is inscribed To the Brave of Both Nations.
Mr John Kelly, who is house-hunting in Cornhill on Tweed, believes Scotland
should give independence a try.
'English people, Scottish people, they're all the same,' he says. 'It's just
the people trying to run the country that get on my nerves.'

FT  23 MAR 92 / Warning on NHS trust hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SELF-GOVERNING hospital trusts will move into the private sector unless
limits are introduced on the number of beds used for private treatment,
according to the NHS Support Federation, a health service pressure group.
Ms Julia Schofield, director of the federation, said NHS patients would be
left with worse care and longer queues as trust hospitals increasingly
turned to a more lucrative private market.
She called for the 10 per cent limit on private beds in NHS hospitals to be
extended to trust hospitals.
The federation claimed that: there is no limit on the number of beds trusts
can provide to private patients;
trusts are under no statutory duty to enter NHS contracts;
trusts can stop making NHS contracts for a service but offer it privately;
trusts are free to close an NHS ward and reopen it as a private ward.
The health service can appeal to the health secretary if a trust attempts to
ends its contracts with the NHS.
Miss Schofield said, however, that this was not a strong enough safeguard.
There were already too few beds and the pool of doctors and nurses was
limited, so a growth in the private sector would mean longer queues for NHS
patients, she said.

<TEXT>
AN ESTIMATE of the time lost to financial institutions in the City through
such interruptions as security alerts, fires, floods and power failure has
been issued by Telehouse, managers of a building in Docklands designed to
withstand failures of facilities, Andrew Jack writes.
It shows that more than a quarter of the 71 institutions questioned had
suffered interruptions to dealing lasting at least an hour in the past year.
At least 15 per cent of those questioned said they had no contingency plans
to deal with interruptions caused by alerts, and a further 49 per cent
taking part in the survey appeared to have no other adequate mechanisms to
deal with a dealing-room failure.
Mr Nick Simms, marketing manager of Telehouse, said a further informal study
of companies in the Broadgate area of the City showed that at least 7 banks
had lost three hours of trading time following a bomb scare earlier this
month.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Vice-chairman to take over as Jaguar chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL HAYDEN, chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, the loss-making
luxury car subsidiary of Ford of the US, is to retire at the end of the
month. He will be replaced by Mr Nick Scheele, previously president of Ford
of Mexico, and Jaguar vice-chairman since January 1.
Mr Scheele's job is to implement the Jaguar new-product plan devised after
Ford's Pounds 1.6bn takeover at the end of 1989. The plan is aimed at
boosting production by the end of the decade to more than 100,000 cars a
year, four times last year's depressed level.
Jaguar's plans for the 1990s include:
A revised version of its XJ6 saloon, code-named the X300, to be launched in
1994.
A replacement for the XJS coupe and convertible ranges, code-named X100, to
be launched in 1996. The launch, probably in 1998, of a smaller sporty
saloon, code-named the X200, to compete with rivals such as the BMW
5-Series. Jaguar hopes it will be able to more than double annual production
from between 50,000 and 70,000 for the other car ranges to between 100,000
and 150,000.
Mr Scheele said Jaguar planned to raise production this year to 27,500, but
'that assumes a recovery in the second half of the year, and at the moment
the signs are not good'. Mr Hayden said Jaguar's break-even point has been
reduced to about 34,000 cars a year.
The company is also planning to reduce its workforce by about 10 per cent or
some 800 people this year.
Jaguar, in loss for the past three years, suffered a record deficit of
Pounds 226m last year.

THE NEAR-disappearance of the closed shop after more than a decade of

The report suggests that many closed shops are 'sleeping dogs'. They avoid
legal problems because nobody is sacked for not belonging to a union, but
otherwise they operate much as before.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Output benefits seen from hours cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half the cost of the recent cuts in the working week for manual
workers in engineering was absorbed by productivity improvements linked to
the hours reductions, says a study published today, Michael Smith writes.
Wage settlements also tended to be lower to help pay for the cut in hours.
Overall, the reductions of two hours, conceded by employers of at least
500,000 manual workers, added less than 1 per cent to the manual labour
costs of the companies which took part in the survey.
That figure shows that employers fell considerably short in their target of
incurring no cost by conceding shorter weeks.
The study, by Mr Ray Richardson and Mr Marcus Rubin of the Centre for
Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, found that about 10
per cent of companies did not negotiate productivity concessions linked to
the hours deals.
However, the study found that, for some companies, the two-hour reduction in
the working week led to a fall, or at least no increase, in labour costs.
This was because bargaining for the reductions became the occasion for
management to press hard for changes which improved efficiency.
This tactic was particularly successful where unions were becoming less
resistant to change. Nearly 80 per cent of managers replying to the survey
said the shorter week had resulted in earlier agreement on changes, or
agreement on changes which would otherwise not have been considered at the
time.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Labour considers uniting public-sector pay bodies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leaders are giving serious consideration to transforming the way in
which public-sector pay is determined and, if elected, may establish a
permanent public-service pay advisory commission to decide pay awards.
They have also indicated that they would not abandon the current attempt to
introduce performance-related pay for 500,000 civil servants.
The public-service pay advisory commission, which would be fully independent
of the government, would supersede the existing pay-review bodies which fix
pay for nearly half of the 4m to 5m public-sector employees, including
doctors, nurses, teachers and the armed forces.
It is also committed to establishing a new pay-review body for university
lecturers. The commission would bring all the existing pay-review bodies
under one roof.
The idea was floated in a 1990 Fabian Society pamphlet by Professor William
Brown and Mr Bob Rowthorn, who suggested that the body's independence could
be ensured by a governing council such as that of the conciliation service
Acas, with some members being nominated by the Confederation of British
Industry and the Trades Union Congress.
Labour officials believe that the current mix of cash-limited collective
bargaining, pay formulas based on the average earnings index and pay-review
bodies is unsatisfactory and is in danger of creating a 'two-tier' system -
with those groups covered by collective bargaining getting left behind.
Even the pay-review bodies themselves, say the officials, 'produce
incredible disparities'. They are also said to be in an institutional
no-man's land, being neither part of the government nor fully independent of
it.
The Labour manifesto commits a Kinnock government to seek 'fairer and more
rational ways of determining public-sector pay within clearly defined budget
limits'.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Secretaries 'often used as glorified typists'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY secretaries feel trapped in their jobs and are still treated as
glorified typists in spite of their 'amazing mix of skills,' according to
the Industrial Society.
Managers were wasting their companies' money by failing to delegate properly
to their secretaries, the society, an independent organisation that promotes
good industrial relations, said before publishing a survey of more than 500
secretaries and 300 managers.
According to the survey more than 40 per cent of bosses see typing as the
first priority in a secretary's job. The society commented that the
difference between a typist and a secretary needed to be defined in many
organisations. This would help to 'eliminate the frustrations caused by
under-use' of secretaries' abilities and training. Companies could also save
money by employing typists instead of secretaries to process text.
The survey indicates that a boss's ideal secretary shows initiative and is
accurate, but is not assertive and probably does not display a sense of
humour.
Asked which attributes they rated most in secretaries, managers put
initiative top, followed by accuracy and confidentiality. Low ratings were
received for flexibility, confidence, knowledge and tact. Bottom of the list
of desired qualities came a sense of humour and assertiveness.
The society said it was difficult to see how a secretary could show
initiative without having knowledge. Furthermore, confidence was essential
if secretaries were to do many of the jobs bosses wanted.
The jobs secretaries perform have changed significantly since 1987, when the
society last carried out a similar survey. Today's secretaries are likely to
spend less time arranging travel and meetings.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: 'Labour gain' stocks extend lead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST full week of the general election campaign proper has seen a clear
gap open in the FT Election Share Index between those shares that stand to
gain if Labour wins and those that would lose from a change of government.
The index, published daily during the campaign, consists of 10 stocks which
might outperform in the event of a Labour victory and 10 which could benefit
from a Conservative win.
The 'Labour gainers' have outperformed the main big-company index, the FT-SE
100, and are very close to the level at which the campaign started.
'Conservative gainers', on the other hand, have lost 6 per cent of their
value during the campaign, with some shares much more badly affected. BET,
for example, the business services company, has seen its shares drop from
153p to 125p, an 18 per cent fall. Investors are worried that the company's
costs would rise if a Labour minimum wage pushed up the pay of office
cleaners and other service workers. (BET argues that it should not be
included in this portion of the index, as it has a construction business
that stands to gain from any increase in infrastructure spending if Labour
wins.)
Courtaulds Textiles, down 9 per cent, also stands to lose from a minimum
wage. Another big loser, National Power, down 12 per cent, is threatened
with tighter regulation under Labour.
The performance of the Labour gainers has been helped by BAT's 5 1/2 per
cent rise since the election was called - mainly due to the company's
announcement last week that it would pay a higher dividend. The 4.7 per cent
drop in the share price of Land Securities, the worst-performing Labour
gainer, is indirectly connected to politics. Property firms are particularly
sensitive to changes in long-term interest rates, which have been rising
steadily over recent weeks as both parties have indicated they would
increase public-sector borrowing.
The index at market close on Friday was: Labour win/ Conservative defeat
shares 99.26; Conservative win/Labour defeat shares 93.42; FT-SE 100 index,
rebased 97.37.
The base for the index is closing prices on the day the election was
announced, Wednesday March 11. Both sections of the index are set to 100 at
that date. The index is constructed on the same basis as the FT 30-share
Ordinary index - which makes it highly sensitive to day-to-day share price
movements and unsuitable for long-term performance measurement.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Thatcher storms back to campaign fray -
Philip Stephens sees the former prime minister relaunch the Tory bid for a
fourth term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS NOT a day for subtleties. Behind in the opinion polls, the team
running Mr John Major's general election campaign needed all the help they
could get. So Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the leader the Conservatives had
unceremoniously dumped, was re-enlisted to back her successor's cause.
Their joint appearance at a gathering of candidates in London was not a
panic reaction to the opinion polls. It was agreed weeks ago that the party
needed a public display of unity to heal the remaining wounds among its
activists.
Few guessed then that her re-emergence centre-stage would coincide with a
relaunch of the Conservative campaign in an abrasive style much more suited
to her political image than to Mr Major's.
After 16 months of caring Conservatism designed to distance Mr Major and his
colleagues from their predecessor, it has taken 10 days of uncertain
campaigning to persuade them that the way to win the election is Mrs
Thatcher's way.
Labour must be branded again as the party of socialists and pacifists, Mr
Neil Kinnock as the unprincipled, untrust-worthy leader who will say
anything to get his hands on the levers of power. An electorate turned
sullen and resentful by the poll tax and economic recession must be
persuaded - as in 1987 - that Labour's tax and spending plans would rob
them.
So, as Mr Major and Mrs Thatcher sat on the same platform, cabinet ministers
who began long ago to speak of her in hushed, embarrassed tones, were
promising to harness again her aggressive campaigning style.
Mr Chris Patten, never 'One of Us', listed her achievements in such glowing
terms that many in the audience must have wondered why she was not still
prime minister. 'Margaret's government,' the party chairman declared,
'transformed Britain in the 1980s. And no one should ever forget that.'
Mrs Thatcher lived up to herself. In a passionate denunciation of socialism,
Brussels and much else she dispelled any lingering suspicion that she might
like to see her colleagues punished by a Labour victory.
There were faint jibes at her successor - she feared the 'enormous detail'
in his manifesto might obscure the important issues and reminded him that it
was vital to keep a grip on public spending - but nothing that could be
branded disloyal. Instead she promised her 'most earnest endeavour' in the
campaign, declaring: 'Everything we have gained could so easily be lost
unless we are returned for a fourth term under John Major's leadership.'
The prime minister took up the same theme. In a speech delivered in
unfamiliarly harsh, and occasionally angry, tones, he decried the 'socialist
stone age', the 'politics of envy' and the 'calculated malice' of his
opponents. Mr Kinnock was mocked by name as party managers abandoned the
earlier plan to keep Mr Major above the fray.
It was the approach demanded by the newspapers sympathetic to the
Conservatives, which yesterday lambasted the party's approach as weak and
directionless. It was one that had Mr Norman Tebbit ready to praise a
campaign team of which he had previously been dismissive. 'At last they've
stopped putting tranquillisers in his (Mr Major's) tea,' he said.
Mrs Thatcher will not be here to see it through until April 9. Her aides
said yesterday that she would be going ahead with a long-planned tour of the
US during the last 10 days of the campaign.
Nor are all in the Conservative camp convinced that the aggressive approach
which fires party activists necessarily wins the votes of waverers among the
electorate. But Mr Major's team promised to press ahead on the same tack
until polling day. And few caught the unintended irony when one strategist
promised that today it was Mr Michael Heseltine's turn to be let loose on
Labour.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown pushes education up agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIBERAL Democrats have sought to focus attention on the party's plans
for a Pounds 2bn increase in education spending by hinting that it could
become a condition for their support in a hung parliament.
Mr Paddy Ashdown, party leader, was meeting strategists last night to
endorse the addition to the Liberal Democrats' terms for a coalition. A
party political broadcast this week is being reworked.
The Liberal Democrats believe their pledge to raise income tax by 1p to fund
education is winning support among voters. One official said the party was
determined to present its proposals with 'panache'.
By setting extra education spending as a pre-condition for its support in a
hung parliament, the party may raise education as an issue.
Meanwhile, Mr Ashdown attacked suggestions that the Tories may forge a deal
with the Ulster Unionists in the event of a hung parliament. It would be
'utterly discreditable' and would jeopardise moves towards peace in Northern
Ireland. The Liberal Democrats would have nothing to do with such a deal, he
said.
Speaking on BBC Radio, Mr Ashdown said proportional representation at
Westminster was the essential pre-requisite for his support in a hung
parliament. After that, there would have to be an agreed programme.
'Essential to that programme for government will be a commitment to invest
in education of the sort that we have made,' he said.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The rush to cash in on savings fears - City
Watch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No industry is following the fortunes of the two main parties more closely
than the savings industry, which directly feeds off tax, pension schemes and
other highly politicised legislation.
Many investment companies are eagerly cashing in on the rush to buy personal
equity plans, with investors calculating that tax breaks which are only
marginal in value under the Conservatives would become worth a great deal
more under Labour's anti-middle-class tax regime.
Save &amp; Prosper hopes to hit Pep sales of Pounds 150m in the financial year
now drawing to a close, against Pounds 85m last time. Total industry Pep
sales may well be Pounds 2bn or more, against Pounds 1.6bn in 1990-91, and
if Labour wins there will be a torrent of money into 1992-93 Peps before a
Budget can be produced which might end them.
Labour has proposed to modify Peps, rather than abolish them. They might be
made smaller, but broadened away from their all-equity basis. Mr Julian
Tregoning, marketing chief at Save &amp; Prosper, says: 'We would like to give
some input to the debate on Peps.'
The product area causing most concern to life assurance companies is
personal pensions. Labour has promised to cancel the 2 per cent 'bribe'
being paid for the next two years to individuals opting out of the state
scheme, Serps, and threatens to require personal-pension providers to give a
pension guarantee related to growth of average earnings.
Mr John Craddock, head of life and pensions at Legal &amp; General, says that
the ending of the 2 per cent incentive would be 'very unfair'. L&amp;G fears
that as many as 1.5m of the estimated 5m personal planholders might return
to Serps.
As for the guarantee, Mr Ron Spill of L&amp;G says: 'We cannot accept an
open-ended liability related to average earnings.' The very survival of
personal pensions might, therefore, depend on some sort of compromise.
However, a Labour administration might bring opportunities as well as
hazards. At Invesco MIM, Mr Keith Crowley, marketing director, is ready to
change direction.' You should have started the planning process three to six
months ago,' he says. 'Flexibility is next to godliness.'
He sees tax angles becoming more important. Labour's preoccupation with
promoting manufacturing investment might provide opportunities, and at the
very least there will be scope for some 'buy before the tax deadline'
promotions.
Meanwhile, life assurance experts argue that tax changes might favour life
company 10-year savings plans and lump-sum products, which at present bear
both income tax and capital gains tax at the standard rate. This might look
more attractive if many more people are paying income tax at up to 50 per
cent, and the capital gains tax exemption limit is sharply reduced from the
Tory level of Pounds 5,800 for 1992-93.
More pessimistic people in the savings business fear that higher taxes and a
crumbling house market could cause severe damage. The middle classes
struggling to pay mortgages and school fees would have nothing left for
savings.
The more sanguine argue that higher taxes will generate more opportunities
for those savings institutions that come up with the right products.
But the tax breaks on mortgages, pensions and life assurance which protected
the middle classes in the 1970s have been reduced or eliminated. Most top
people in the savings industry will not look forward to testing their powers
of ingenuity under Labour.

Scotland is once again acting as a proving ground for brave young Sassenach
Tories who have not yet earned a winnable seat in England.
The honour of fighting Glasgow Provan, one of the safest Labour seats
anywhere, goes to 26-year-old Andrew Rosindell, from Romford, Essex. In 1987
the Conservative candidate - a Londoner - narrowly beat the Alliance for
third place with less than 8 per cent of the votes. Labour took 73 per cent.
This time fewer of the mini-biographies in the guide to Scottish
Conservative candidates betray an English provenance than in 1987, but the
birthplace and schools of some hopefuls are conspicuous by their absence.

Peter Mandelson's exile to the north-east, where he is fighting to become MP
for Hartlepool, is not preventing him from playing kingmaker, a role he
pursued vigorously when in charge of Labour's communications strategy.
Mandelson's regular column in The People yesterday had kind words for
Harriet Harman, a Labour health spokesman, and Tony Blair, shadow employment
secretary, who Mandelson bizarrely thinks emerged 'entirely unscathed' from
a drubbing on the minimum wage with a nursery owner on the BBC's Election
Call.
Even more striking is Mandelson's plaudit for Bryan Gould, shadow
environment secretary, whose soaring reputation Mandelson quietly helped
contain in the late 1980s, when the Kinnock entourage thought the MP for
Dagenham over-ambitious and loose of tongue.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: A case of the jitters in the Tory press -
Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Tory press has concluded that the Conservatives lost the first week of
the election campaign and may well lose the election itself if they do not
step up the fight. Some of the comments have been quite sharp. Andrew Neil,
the editor of The Sunday Times, wrote a signed editorial in his paper
yesterday headed 'Round one to Labour'.
It said: 'The Tory performance so far has been dismal. It must now have
dawned on the prime minister and even the most complacent of his advisers
just what a weak hand they have dealt themselves. They were warned not to go
into the election with the present lacklustre team, and especially the
present chancellor.' (The Sunday Times has long campaigned against
chancellor Lamont.)
Other Tory newspapers have come to much the same conclusion, urging John
Major to take off the gloves. Old loyalties to Margaret Thatcher are
reasserting themselves in The Sunday Telegraph and Sunday Express.
There may be a note of panic, too, about the role of the Tory press under a
Labour government. The Murdoch group, with its five titles, is vulnerable to
Labour's promised attack on concentration of ownership. It would not be
unknown for a Murdoch title to switch sides - Murdoch's Scottish Sun has
already declared for an independent Scotland and his papers outside Britain
have proved politically flexible. In England, only Today has hedged its bets
so far.
In the Tory party, the panic runs deep. Remember 'wobbly Thursday' in the
last general election? The Tories suddenly thought that they might lose and
started quarrelling among themselves. It was a false alarm. This time there
is rather more justification. If they do lose, the inquest will be
horrendous.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE TORIES must ram home the message that Labour's manifesto programme would
cost the average taxpayer an extra Pounds 1,250 a year, Mr John Major told a
London rally of candidates yesterday.
Mr Major ridiculed the small amounts for most gainers under Labour's
proposals, calling the tax increases to pay for them 'a systematic
smash-and-grab raid on the independent, the hard-working, the middle-income
families of Britain'.
He condemned Labour's Budget as 'economic illiteracy with a dash of
calculated malice - intended to wound, intended to bite'. He added: 'We'll
make sure it's doomed to failure.'
Challenging Mr Neil Kinnock to set out his own costed programme, Mr Major
called on the Labour leader to 'stand by your promises - or withdraw them'.
He added: 'Dig deep behind those pledges and come up with the tax, the whole
tax and nothing but the tax.'
In a vitriolic attack on Labour's campaigning tactics on the National Health
Service, he denounced Opposition 'friends' of the NHS as 'parasites who
swoop on human error and personal tragedy, and can scarce disguise their
relish as they do so'.
However, in a television interview Mr Major sounded defensive on the balance
between using the product of economic growth for public spending and using
it for tax cuts.
Questioned by Mr Brian Walden on London Weekend Television, Mr Major argued
that lower taxes helped public services by 'incentivising' the doctors,
nurses and teachers who worked in them. Spending on public services was due
to rise by more than Pounds 5bn next year, Mr Major said, while the Budget
tax cut would cost only Pounds 1.8bn and was directed at people on modest
incomes, many of them in the caring services.
Mr Major also rejected the suggestion that the government was uncaring
towards the unemployed. 'If you really care about the people across this
country . . . you've got to take the decisions now to get rid of that cancer
of inflation and have the right economic circumstances for growth in the
future,' he insisted.
Labour seized on his defence of the flat-rate principle of the poll tax,
which is being replaced by the council tax, as a gaffe. Mr Major said that
on the government's original estimates of the charge at Pounds 224, the poll
tax would have been fair because of the contribution to local government
spending from the 'sharply progressive' income-tax system.
Mr Gordon Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, told a rally in
Nottingham yesterday that action to bring down unemployment was essential to
bring an end to the recession.
He also used his speech to counter the Tory charge that Labour's tax plans
would damage prospects for young people starting their careers, by focusing
on the consequences of the recession for the young.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Field Marshal Patten calls in big guns -
David Marsh on the Tory chairman's battle in Bath
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSTLING Regency emporium of Bath boasts 800 shops serving a population
of just 85,000. 'Pure magic. It is the Mecca for retailing outside London,'
enthuses Ms Eileen Walkington, the breathless Lancashire-born director of
the city's chamber of commerce.
The political opponents of Mr Chris Patten, the sleepless-eyed chairman of
the Tory party and Bath's MP since 1979, are trying to turn this centre of
shopping pilgrimage into a Conservative graveyard.
In 1987 Mr Patten had a slender 1,412 majority over the Alliance candidate.
He now faces a tough battle with a broad coalition of anti-Patten
campaigners, egged on by a vociferous group of Bath traders complaining
about high rents and rates.
Mr Patten is hoping that this month's Budget moves to ease the burden of the
uniform business rate (UBR) will defuse the Bath shopkeepers' revolt. But as
the Conservative party's image-maker, as well as the man responsible for
introducing the poll tax to England and Wales during his previous job as
environment secretary, Mr Patten is vulnerable to the anti-Tory swing across
southern England.
Mr Don Foster, the studious 44-year-old Liberal Democrat candidate, is
working flat-out to woo the shopkeepers. Buoyed by early canvassing returns,
Mr Foster says he has 'difficulty containing his exuberance' about his
prospects for victory.
Mr Patten, who rushes to Bath every afternoon after mornings spent in London
masterminding Tory strategy, is confident of weathering the challenge. He
claims he will win, with an increased majority. Field Marshal Patten says he
will call on 'heavy artillery' from headquarters  - including, probably, Mr
John Major - to back his electioneering.
Mr Patten may spend his mornings in the capital heaping invective on Labour,
but the three-cornered fight in Bath means he needs the local Labour
candidate. He is relying on Ms Pam Richards, a part-time social worker who
has been a city councillor since 1980, to make inroads into the Liberal
Democrat vote.
Ms Richards has little hope of taking Labour above its third place in 1987,
but she refuses to be distracted by suggestions that Labour supporters
should transfer their vote to the Liberal Democrats.
The three-year controversy in Bath about the effect of high commercial rents
and the UBR has clearly undermined the Tories' reputation as the
shopkeepers' party. Mr Eric Snook, a toy-shop owner and Conservative city
councillor, says the criticism from the retail trade is overdone. But he
admits that commercial rents in the city centre - a third of which are paid
directly to the council - have been 'hyped up', contributing to a rise in
business failures.
The retail protestors say both rents and rates are set at values fixed in
1988-89 at the peak of the boom, and are still rising in spite of the
downturn.
Mr Philip Andrews, a leading member of Barrb, a loose grouping of Bath
businesses fighting rent and rates increases, is standing as an independent.
A 38-year-old ecologist and nightclub owner whose father worked for MI6, he
says Mr Patten has been unable to act on the issue because of 'party
self-interest'.
Mr Robert Mimmack is director of property and engineering services at the
Conservative-controlled city council, whose estates department is the
largest landowner in the city centre. He admits that the Pounds 8m annual
receipts from commercial rents - 15 per cent of total city revenues - help
keep Bath's poll tax bills down, a crucial factor helping Mr Patten. One
effect of soaring overheads, as well as general problems caused by the
recession, is that 8 per cent of roughly 600 shops in the city centre are
empty, Mr Mimmack says.
Bath Tories say Mr Patten's jocularly professional campaign will blunt his
opponents' stings. Nonetheless, national and local factors have increased
the risk that, on polling day, the Conservative party chairman could become
another victim of Bath's wave of boom and bust.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Poll cheer for Kinnock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FINE print of this weekend's polls will have gone down just as well at
Labour's Walworth Road headquarters as the headline figures showing a Labour
lead in four cases out of five.
The party will have been heartened by its generally improved showing for
economic competence, by evidence that Mr Neil Kinnock is making up ground on
the other leaders, and by indications that voters see the National Health
Service as the most important issue.
The Conservatives will be concerned by the finding in the Mori poll for The
Sunday Times that tax is well down the list of decisive issues.
But they will take heart from suggestions in yesterday's NOP survey for The
Independent on Sunday that an increasing number of voters think Labour is
making promises the country cannot afford.
For all that, Mr John Smith's shadow Budget appears to have bolstered his
status. In the Observer/Harris poll 40 per cent thought Mr Smith the best
choice for chancellor, compared with 27 per cent for Mr Norman Lamont. A
Mail on Sunday/NOP survey gave Mr Smith a 32 percentage point lead over his
opposite number.
On economic competence, Labour scored its first positive rating in the
Independent survey since the newspaper's pollsters started monitoring the
subject last May.
Overall, 47 per cent of those sampled regarded Labour as very or fairly
competent on the economy, and 46 per cent said they were not very or not at
all competent - compared with 43 per cent and 50 per cent respectively in
the previous week.
The Conservatives scored plus 5 percentage points on the same measure. The
Sunday Times gave the Tories a 9 percentage point lead over Labour on
managing the economy.
A Sunday Express/ICM poll gave Labour a 1 percentage point lead over the
Tories on the question: 'Which party will make your family better off?'
Labour will be less pleased with the Independent's finding that 56 per cent
of respondents thought it would 'put up income tax sharply for people on
average earnings'.
Mr Kinnock still lies third in the popularity stakes among the party leaders
but has picked up 4 percentage points according to the Mail on Sunday, to
trail Mr John Major, the prime minister, by 16. In Scotland a Mori poll
showed a 3 percentage point drop in support for the Conservatives compared
with a week ago and a 3 percentage point rise in backing for the Scottish
National party. It put Labour on 43 per cent (up 1), SNP on 27 per cent (up
3), Conservatives on 20 (down 3) and the Liberal Democrats on 9 per cent
(down 2). A single constituency poll on Mid Staffordshire for the Birmingham
Post indicates Labour could hold the seat - which it won with a 21.3 per
cent swing in a 1990 by-election - with an increased majority.
A poll in the Wallasey, Merseyside, constituency where Mrs Lynda Chalker,
the overseas development minister, is defending a majority of just 279,
showed the Conservatives trailing, but by only 1.2 percentage points.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Rival Budgets key to marginals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARETH SMYTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE election campaign moves into its second week, party strategists
believe that the reaction of voters to their tax proposals could be decisive
in crucial marginal seats.
Conservative officials have set out to make income tax an electoral issue,
and the March 10 Budget, featuring a lower rate of tax for the first Pounds
2,000 of earnings, signalled the start of the election campaign.
Labour's shadow Budget responded by proposing to abolish the earnings
ceiling on National Insurance contributions and setting a tax rate of 50 per
cent for higher earners. It claimed that eight out of 10 families would
benefit.
This concentration on the tax issue is risky for both main parties. The
danger for the Tories is that there is evidence that people are prepared to
pay higher taxes for better public services. For Labour, the risk is that
they will be branded as the party of tax increases.
In order to assess the impact of the rival proposals, FT reporters have
visited three marginals in different regions where Labour came second in the
last election.
Brentford and Isleworth in London, Birmingham Hall Green in the Midlands and
Davyhulme in north-west England look typical of marginals within their
regions.
They were selected because they are likely to reflect the social make-up of
marginals in these three regions - which contain 63 of the 94 Tory seats
Labour would probably need to win an overall majority.
A rough guide to how typical the marginal seats are of their region can be
drawn from the 1981 census on 'socio-economic groups'. In the north-west,
London and the west Midlands, the marginals seem to contain more of the
higher-income groups than the regional average. The east Midlands marginals
contain fewer high earners.
So the marginals appear to contain a bigger proportion than the country in
general of voters likely to be disadvantaged by Labour's tax proposals.

DAVYHULME
Conservative majority 8,199
Labour requires 8.1% swing to win.
57% of voters are middle class, 17% managerial/professional
MOST voters in the suburban Manchester constituency of Davyhulme think of
themselves as middle class but, in terms of personal income, not quite the
same middle class as that of London and south-east England. The perception
is important and contributes to the absence of any evidence that the tax
proposals of the three main parties will be a decisive issue on April 9.
Davyhulme and the Stretford seat that preceded it has been held for 22 years
by Mr Winston Churchill. To wipe out his 8,199 majority Labour needs a swing
of 8.1 per cent. It is just about the last seat Labour needs to put Mr
Kinnock into Downing Street with an overall majority.
Locally the contest has yet to be fully joined. Mr Churchill was at his
son's wedding at the weekend and Ms Jackie Pearcey, the Liberal Democrat,
only had her adoption meeting on Friday evening. As elsewhere in the
north-west, Labour and its Davyhulme candidate Mr Barry Brotherton appear to
have made the fastest start.
The constituency ranges from the affluent avenues of Sale through swathes of
three-bedroomed semi-detacheds in Urmston and Flixton to the council and
terraced housing of Partington and Carrington.
Mr Churchill says differences between Labour and Conservative tax policies
will be an important element in his campaign, Ms Pearcey is confident that
the Liberal Democrats' plans for 1p on income tax to fund education is a
winning policy, while Mr Brotherton, leader of the Trafford Labour group,
says no-one has raised with him the issue of his party's tax plans. He
thinks most of those who would have to pay more tax under Labour are
Conservative voters.
Mr John Smith's assurance that eight out of 10 taxpayers would be better off
as a result of his Budget proposals appears broadly to have been
unchallenged, and the majority of people in Davyhulme would identify
themselves as part of that 80 per cent.
A sales manager at a company in the Trafford Park industrial estate earning
what he considers to be good salary of Pounds 19,000 said he worried less
about Labour's plans than the depth of the recession and the threat of
redundancy. 'I reckon it will hit people much harder down south,' he said.
He and several others said they would vote Tory reluctantly because they
could not contemplate the prospect of Mr Kinnock in Downing Street.
Ms Pearcey, a radiological safety analyst with a PhD in applied nuclear
physics, thinks it is the commitment of the Liberal Democrats to fund
education through an increase in tax that will help her to push Labour into
third place.
'There is absolutely no enthusiasm among dissatisfied Tories to vote Labour.
It would be a big mistake to regard this seat as a Tory-Labour marginal.'

BRENTFORD AND ISLEWORTH
Conservative majority 7,953
Labour requires 7.8% swing to win.
59% of voters are middle class, 20% managerial/professional
A BLOOD-curdling scream startles drinkers at the Barley Mow public house in
Turnham Green, west London.
'Aaargh] We're surrounded by Tories,' exclaims Mr Mick Carroll, a chef,
spying Mr Nirj Deva, Conservative candidate for Brentford and Isleworth, as
he makes the sign of the crucifix.
On the next bar-stool, Ms Vesna Novakovic, a financial consultant, says she
will not vote Labour because of its tax plans. 'Labour have got a history of
raising tax. They would discourage people from doing well.'
On such anecdotal evidence, it is far from certain whether the tax and
National Insurance plans outlined in Mr John Smith's shadow Budget will be
the cornerstone of a Labour victory in London or a millstone around its
neck.
Brentford and Isleworth, held for the Tories by Sir Barney Hayhoe since
1974, is typical of the seats in the capital Labour must win if Mr Neil
Kinnock is to secure the 20-seat majority he predicts on April 9.
Requiring a swing of more than 7 per cent to change hands, this
exceptionally mixed constituency lies about 20th on Labour's list of target
seats in the capital. But Labour will have to persuade some of the seat's
professionals and middle managers - a fifth of the electorate - to vote
against their wallets.
The focus on tax will certainly touch off a testy battle of statistics. Ms
Ann Keen, the Labour candidate, recently received from campaign HQ figures
purporting to show the effect of the shadow Budget proposals on London
marginals. According to these, almost 88 per cent of the Brentford and
Isleworth labour force would gain from the plans.
Circulars bearing the imprint of Conservative Central Office tell a
different story. They say Labour's tax plans would cost the average male
full-time worker in London nearly Pounds 4 a week.
Ms Keen does not expect to be significantly handicapped by Mr Smith's
proposals, although she accepts 'there will always be some people who don't
want to pay more.'
Mr Deva intends couching his tax-related arguments in broader terms than
just the effect on constituents' individual pay packets.
'Labour's tax plans would take money out of a consumer recovery,' he says.
For the Liberal Democrats, Ms Janet Salmon hopes Mr Smith's tax plans will
be unpalatable enough to prompt those voters who have decided it is time for
a change of government to turn to her. In addition the constituency's
swelling ranks of unemployed say they would 'love to be in a position to pay
tax', she says.

Yearly data for retail sales volume and industrial production plus all
data for the vacancy rate indicator are in index form with 1985=100.
Quarterly and monthly data for retail sales and industrial production
show the percentage change over the corresponding period in the
previous year, and are positive unless otherwise stated. The
unemployment rate is shown as a percentage of the total labour force.
Figures for the composite leading indicator are end-period values.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Unemployment side-effects of inflation convergence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO government would have found it easy to put an optimistic gloss on last
week's UK unemployment and inflation figures. Unemployment has now risen by
over a million since the recession began, yet both wage and underlying price
inflation rates remain unsustainably high.
The Conservative party's labour market reforms were supposed to make the
labour market more 'flexible'. At the microeconomic level they have
succeeded. Reducing the power of national trade unions, removing
restrictions on the ability of employers to hire and fire and encouraging
decentralised pay bargaining have increased the variation in wages by age,
skill and region.
Yet these changes do not seem to have reduced the unemployment cost that the
economy must pay to cut aggregate wage and price inflation. The chart shows
the average annual unemployment cost that OECD countries paid in the 1980s
to reduce inflation to their lowest point: the steeper the line, the greater
the sacrifice in terms of lost jobs needed to reduce inflation by 1
percentage point.
The UK 'sacrifice ratio' implies that in the 1980s a 2 percentage point drop
in inflation required unemployment to rise by 1 percentage point a year.
This ratio is above average for OECD countries and much higher than in the
US and Sweden.
The government reforms do not seem to have cut the UK sacrifice ratio in
this recession. Retail price inflation has fallen by 6 1/2 percentage points
since its November 1990 peak while unemployment has risen by 3.3 percentage
points on the OECD definition, leaving the sacrifice ratio unchanged. The
fall in underlying inflation has been more modest.
Wage inflation has fallen at an even more sluggish pace. Membership of the
European exchange rate mechanism means that average earnings cannot grow
faster than in the UK's main European competitors - perhaps 5 per cent or
less a year - without further eroding the competitiveness of UK exports,
unless manufacturing productivity also grows faster. But after six quarters
of recession, the underlying annual rate of UK wage inflation is 7 1/4   per
cent, a fall of just half a percentage point in six months.
Unemployment will have to rise above 3m before the adjustment to the ERM is
complete. In the 1980s, OECD calculations show that the annual rate of UK
wage inflation fell by 0.3 percentage points for every 100,000 jobs lost.
With the sacrifice ratio unchanged, reducing wage inflation from 10 per cent
to 5 per cent will require a rise in total unemployment of 1 2/3  m compared
to a little over one million so far.
The longer this wage adjustment takes within the ERM, the more export
competitiveness will be eroded and the harder the adjustment becomes as the
latest OECD report on the Spanish economy indicates.  Average earnings in
Spain rose by 9 per cent in 1991, despite an unemployment rate of 16 per
cent, raising Spanish export prices and increasing the trade deifict.
Why is reducing the going rate of wage increases in Spain and the UK so
costly? One reason is the unco-ordinated and partially decentralised system
of wage bargaining in both countries. Sweden has a highly centralised wage
bargaining with powerful unions and employers which together set the going
rate of wage increases. Sweden's sacrifice ratio is very low. The US has
weak unions and almost no collective bargaining; its sacrifice ratio is
similarly low.
The UK labour market reforms of the last 12 years ago have left the UK, like
Spain, in the middle: little employer co-ordination, relatively powerful
plant level unions and a desynchronised wage round all make it hard for
employers to reduce their wage settlements below the going rate. The
rational solution is either more co-ordination, as Labour appears to be
offering, or more union-bashing from the Tories.  Here is one area where a
middle of the road compromise would be inferior.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Fewer Nigerians

<TEXT>
Nigeria has 88.5m people, 20m fewer than estimated, according to its first
accurate census, writes Michael Holman.
The combination of religious and regional rivalries, and the temptation for
the state governments to inflate population figures to obtain a greater
share of federal government revenue, meant that past counts ended in
controversy.
The 1991 census showed 46.88m in the Moslem north, 41.25m in the Christian
south and 379,000 in the federal capital territory of Abuja.

PUNJAB'S newly elected chief minister yesterday called in the Indian army to
help police crush Sikh militants who have shot dead almost 70 people in
recent days, Reuter reports.
Mr Beant Singh said two army generals and Punjab's police chief would
oversee the crackdown in the industrial city of Ludhiana and areas south of
it. Soldiers and paramilitaries are backing up police in house-to-house
searches.
Sikh militants, who are fighting for a separate homeland, have vowed to
punish anyone who voted in the February 19 elections or who collaborates
with Mr Singh's government.

ARGENTINE police arrested four people at the weekend over the bombing of the

Witnesses to the arrests said they believed the four, all men, were of Arab
descent. The bomb destroyed the embassy and injured 225 people.
Mr Jose Luis Manzano, Argentina's interior minister, said last week that
investigators believed a remote control device detonated 100kg of explosives
packed in a truck parked in front of the embassy.
Lebanon's pro-Iranian Islamic Jihad, said it planted the bomb to avenge
Israel's killing last month of Hizbollah leader Sheikh Abbas Musawi.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT to shoot a top politician has shaken the Japanese authorities out
of their complacency about security just months before a nationwide election
campaign, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
A young ultra-rightist infiltrated a provincial meeting of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Friday and fired three shots at the
powerful party vice-president, Mr Shin Kanemaru.
No one was hurt, but one bullet flew close to Mr Kanemaru's head. 'I thought
wind or an insect was passing by me,' the 77-year-old politician said
afterwards.
The shooting in Ashikaga, north of Tokyo, has provoked an outcry in Japan,
with calls to tighten security around public figures because of the
increasing use of firearms.
Embarrassed police said that, despite past right-wing threats to Mr
Kanemaru, they were not prepared for a gun attack. All their preparation had
been aimed at foiling assaults by swords or knives.
'We were caught in a blind spot,' said the national police chief, Mr Ryoichi
Suzuki.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and other LDP leaders, including Mr
Kanemaru, had been expected to criss-cross the country in coming months to
try to restore their waning fortunes before July's elections.
Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, the LDP secretary-general, said the party would have
to reconsider senior officials' travel plans because police could not
guarantee total security.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTEEN people were killed in clashes between troops and Kurdish
demonstrators in south-east Turkey yesterday, bringing the weekend's death
toll to 45, Reuter reports from Diyarbakir.
The violence was some of the worst since the outlawed Kurdish Workers Party
(PKK) began its fight for an independent state in 1984.
The worsening crisis has dimmed hopes that the four-month-old government of
prime minister Mr Suleyman Demirel will be able to solve what he describes
as Turkey's biggest problem.
Security officials said 10 people were killed and 20 wounded in the town of
Nusaybin on the Syrian border as troops clashed with marchers.
In Yuksekova, on the Iranian and Iraqi borders near Hakkari province, five
people were killed and 32 injured when government forces clashed with a
crowd rallying for Kurdish independence, the semi-official Anatolian news
agency said.
The agency said 70 people were detained in the town where a curfew was later
declared.
The PKK had threatened an uprising to coincide with Saturday's Kurdish New
Year in the impoverished south-east which has seen seven years of PKK
insurgency in which more than 3,400 people have been killed. Protests swept
other south-eastern towns yesterday.
The government accused PKK guerrillas of provoking trouble. Witnesses said
the PKK, which had urged its supporters to launch a popular uprising to
coincide with the spring festival of Nowrouz, put masked gunmen into the
streets to back youngsters building barricades.
Local Kurds said security forces had dispersed peaceful crowds with tear-gas
and gunfire.
Turkey has an estimated 10m Kurds among its 57m people. Many are integrated
into Turkish life and have little sympathy for the PKK's armed campaign in
which more than 3,400 people have been killed.
But the latest violence has underlined the failure of successive governments
to dent the PKK's popularity among disaffected Kurds in the impoverished
south-east.
It will make it harder for Kurdish nationalist members of parliament to stay
in the conservative social democrat coalition government led by Mr Demirel.
Kurds in towns like Cizre, located on a bend in the Tigris river near
Turkey's borders with Syria and Iraq, say raw repression remains the order
of the day.
'The government treats us like animals,' said a relative of a boy shot dead
on Saturday. 'We will fight back.'

FT  23 MAR 92 / EC split over defence industry: Ministers fail to agree on
scope for Community assistance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK BLUM

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community industry ministers failed at the weekend to agree on an
EC policy towards the defence industry, which is suffering from
over-capacity in the aftermath of the Cold War.
Mr Luis Mira Amaral, Portugal's industry minister, said there were clear
differences at the informal meeting in Lisbon on whether the Community
should develop an EC-wide approach to the industry.
Unlike industries such as textiles, many defence companies were concentrated
in relatively prosperous regions in Britain, France and Germany. This made
it difficult for the Community to help, as most of its industrial aid was
focused on depressed regions.
Mr Martin Bangemann, vice-president of the EC's executive Commission,
presented a paper seeking member states' views on whether a special
initiative on the arms industry was needed.
Lord Reay, Britain's under-secretary of state for industry, said the paper
on defence industries raised more questions than answered. 'I don't believe
there is scope for Community action in this field.'
Others were more prepared to consider Community action. 'France is not
opposed to using EC funds to facilitate reconversion,' said Mr Dominique
Strauss-Kahn, the French industry minister. However, both Britain and France
believed the Western European Union and Nato's Independent European
Programme Group which deals with arms procurement, were more appropriate
forums for discussing the issues.
There was broader agreement over co-operation with eastern Europe and the
republics of the former Soviet Union. In its first comprehensive report on
industrial prospects of the region, the Commission said there was an urgent
need to encourage investment and industrial restructuring.
Foreign investment in 1990 at Ecu2.1bn (Pounds 1.49bn) in central and
eastern Europe and Ecu2.3bn in the former Soviet Union remained well below
the potential.
'The scale of the task is without precedents . . . The transition (to market
economies) will probably take a very long time, and a substantial part of
industry will remain for some time yet under state tutelage,' the report
said.
Recent upheavals in the region had created serious economic distortions, but
co-operation depended on pursuing the path of reform. Creating the right
economic and business environment with better information was crucial to
attract more investors.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIS morning the builders will arrive with their bulldozers at the Quai de
la Gare in eastern Paris to begin work on the Bibliotheque de France, the
new national library which is the latest and most controversial of the
French government's recent architectural monuments.
The project, known as the tres grande bibliotheque in France, has been
clouded by controversy ever since Mr Dominique Perrault, its architect,
unveiled his first designs for a building with sunken study cloister and
giant glass storage towers.
Mr Perrault had conceived a building in which the readers would be 'buried'
underground in the cloister and the books, now in the old Bibliotheque
Nationale at the back of the Palais Royal in central Paris, would be stacked
in the 20-storey towers.
His design provoked a storm of criticism in the French press and from
scholars who claimed that France's academic treasures would be roasted by
the sun streaming through the glazed towers. President Francois Mitterrand
eventually agreed to consider the complaints, despite the opposition of Mr
Jack Lang, his minister of culture, who still supported the original design.
Mr Perrault was forced to modify his plans. The much-criticised glass towers
have been scaled down in size and more of the books will be stored
underground.
Even so, the construction of the library, scheduled to start last November
and to open in 1995, had to be delayed when a group of homeless families
squatted on the Quai de la Gare site. They have moved away, however, and the
Conseil Superieur des Bibliotheques, which runs France's libraries, has
approved Mr Perrault's new design. So the builders are finally free to begin
work on France's tres grande bibliotheque.

FT  23 MAR 92 / The European Market: Telecommunications sector looks to the
east - Joint ventures abound in former communist bloc but there is a long
way to go
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Telecommunications was one of the most underdeveloped sectors of the old
eastern bloc. But it is now brimming with life.
Scores of joint ventures between domestic and western enterprises have been
formed, and governments are giving top priority to investment in
telecommunications.
Part of the reason for the burst of activity is that eastern Europe has a
long way to catch up. Under communism, telecommunications was given a low
priority, for ideological reasons. Party bosses realised that allowing it to
develop untrammeled might encourage democratic forces.
The region's new governments have taken an opposite approach. They believe
more telephones are needed to protect democracy and to underpin the
development of free market economies.
Only two years ago, the region's telecommunications infrastructure was in a
parlous state. Few people had phones; most were concentrated among the
communist elite. Much of the equipment was shoddy, in some cases dating from
before the second world war.
Business services, such as faxes and mobile phones, and international
communications were particularly hard to come by. Until recently, for
example, all foreign calls from the Soviet Union's 290m people had to be
channeled through one exchange in Moscow, which had only 16 circuits to the
US and 34 to the UK.
These bottlenecks, particularly in Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia, have
been the first to be tackled. 'Business services are already adequate and
will be up to western standards in two years,' says Mr Blake Swensrud,
president of International Technology Consultants, a Washington consulting
firm specialising in eastern Europe.
Businesses have been given priority and foreign telephone companies have
been installing special networks to cater for these customers. Their joint
ventures fall into three main categories:
Internationaj evahanges. Improving international communications is a rapid
way of earning money, because of the high price of foreign calls and the
increased need for eastern Europe to communicate with the rest of the world.
Most of the new countries in the Commonwealth of Independent States are
putting in their own international networks. US West of America is
installing exchanges in Moscow and Lithuania. Australia's OTC has put an
exchange in Kazakhstan, American Telephone and Telegraph has installed one
in Armenia, and Canada's Teleglobe has been commissioned by Moldova.
Cellular networks. These are a quick way of providing companies with
telephones because they use radio links and so no roads need to be dug up.
Once fixed networks are in place, the cellular ones will be used for mobile
communications. The largest deal was in Poland, where France Telecom and
Ameritech of the US are said to have paid Dollars 80m to Dollars 100m
(Pounds 58m) for a licence. Overlay networks. These fixed networks are often
separate from the countries' public networks, giving a better service for a
premium price. Sovintel, a joint venture between GTE and Sovam, both of the
US, is putting in such a network for Moscow's international business
community. The UK's Cable &amp; Wireless is building a modern network for the
Polish port of Gdansk.
Providing telephone lines to the masses of eastern Europe will take much
longer.
The UK-based Telecommunications Research Centre estimates that it will cost
Dollars 60bn to increase the number of phone lines from the current average
of 10-15 per 100 people to 25-30, which would still be less than the 50
common in the west.
The outlook for most of the CIS is particularly bad. Mr Swensrud says,
'Russia is just so big it's going to be very difficult to develop the
network. In the Ukraine, nothing will happen overnight.'
Nevertheless a start has been made on this massive job.
First, the western embargo on exports of high technology is being relaxed.
Second, foreign telecommunications manufacturers have formed joint ventures
to make exchanges and transmission equipment locally. Germany's Siemens,
France's Alcatel, AT&amp;T and Sweden's Ericsson have been particularly active.
Third, the state-owned telephone companies are being re-organised. Telephone
companies in Hungary and Poland have been separated from the national post
offices and similar moves are planned in Czechoslovakia and Bulgaria. Most
countries are also putting up prices to make their phone companies more
profitable.
That will help generate finance for investment, but most countries are also
looking for other sources of funds.
The European Bank for Reconstruction and Development and the World Bank will
help fill part of this gap. Four of the 14 loans made so far by the EBRD
have been for telecommunications, including the largest, an Ecu142m (Pounds
101.5m) loan to bring 1m modern telephone lines to Romania.
But countries will be looking to the private sector for the lion's share of
their external financing needs.
The big money will come when governments privatise their telephone
companies, selling large chunks to foreign operators which could bring
finance and management skills. Hungary, Poland and Czechoslovakia are going
down this route and could complete sales in the next year.
But, with Latin American and south-east Asian telephone companies also up
for sale, other eastern European countries will have to move smartly or the
supply of buyers may run out.

<TEXT>
THE possible sale of the missile and aircraft divisions of LTV, the large
bankrupt US steel maker, to France's Thomson-CSF should be reviewed because
of its potential impact on national and economic security, the chairman and
vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee havetold President George
Bush, Nancy Dunne writes in Washington.
Similar concern was expressed in a letter to Mr Bush on March 10 from 40
senators of both parties, worried that foreign companies, backed by their
governments, might obtain advanced technology.
The sale of LTV's aircraft and missiles division to Vought, a new group
jointly owned by Martin Marietta and Lockheed, could be jeopardised, the
senators said, by 'a pending higher offer' from Thomson-CSF, the defence
electronics group, and Carlyle Group, a Washington investment banking firm.
Although LTV and its union have accepted the Vought offer, there is concern
that a federal bankruptcy court will require LTV to accept Thomson's higher
offer.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Clinton urges reform of Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas, overwhelming favourite to be the
Democratic party's presidential nominee, yesterday added his voice to the
calls for reform in the way the US Congress does business, writes Jurek
Martin.
But he did so in a different way from President George Bush's demand that
the solution lay in throwing out the Democrats from their long control of
the legislature.
Interviewed on TV, Mr Clinton agreed Congress was too entrenched in its way,
was too subject to pressure from special interest groups, and probably
enjoyed too many perks.
But the real problem, he said, was the lack of a real partnership between
the president and Congress. The Reagan and Bush administrations had been so
intent on confrontation they had 'let Congress drift in an unfortunate way'.
It was, he said, typical that Mr Bush should veto, as announced on Friday,
the lastest economic reform package passed on Capitol Hill. It was a serious
attempt to deal with economic problems and inappropriate to block it simply
because it would have increased income taxes on the wealthiest Americans.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Collor sacks defender of Amazon rainforest: Environment row
in Brazil as Earth Summit approaches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor of Brazil has sacked his environment minister, Mr
Jose Lutzenberger, one of the world's leading defenders of the Amazon
rainforest, just two months before Brazil is due to host the United Nations
World Environment Conference.
The move comes after Mr Lutzenberger embarrassed the government by publicly
accusing Ibama, the federal agency responsible for protecting the forest, of
corruption and misuse of foreign funds.
Speaking in New York last week at a preparatory meeting for the UN
conference, or Earth Summit, Mr Lutzenberger accused Ibama of working 'as an
agent for the woodchoppers' and distributing licences to chop down the
Amazon. Irritated by the controversy, Mr Collor has also sacked the head of
Ibama.
Ironically, despite Mr Lutzenberger's claims that Amazonian forest fires
have been reduced during his tenure, the figures for last year are expected
to show an increase. However, the main reason for his dismissal was Mr
Collor's fear that Mr Lutzenberger would embarrass Brazil at the Earth
Summit by resigning with an attack on the government.
Mr Lutzenberger, the most colourful figure in the Brazilian cabinet, is a
world-renowned ecologist whose appointment as minister in 1990 was seen as a
clever ploy by Mr Collor to stifle international criticism of Brazil's poor
environmental record.
Known for his eccentric behaviour, he is no stranger to controversy. At the
previous preparatory meeting in Geneva he sparked off a row by referring to
the governor of Amazonas state as 'a baboon' and calling the Brazilian
military 'the enemies of the environment' for opposing what they see as
international interference in the Amazon.
Mr Lutzenberger achieved little in office other than to secure the
demarcation of a reserve for the threatened Yanomami Indian population. He
often admitted that he felt frustrated in government and it was thought to
be only a matter of time before he resigned.
Mr Jose Goldemberg, the education minister, who takes over the post
temporarily, admitted 'there has been considerable divergence between the
environmental position defended by our Foreign Office and Lutzenberger's
declarations'. The government has had difficulty forming a coherent position
to take to the summit. Mr Lutzenberger has not agreed with the Foreign
Office emphasis on 'sustainable development' as a solution to the Amazon
problem, fearing it could be misused by those intent on exploitation.
The third minister to be dismissed in a month, he is likely to prove a
weighty opponent.
After being informed of his dismissal he said that were he not having to
take penicillin he would be 'drinking champagne'. However, he added: 'I also
feel sad because I fear what may now happen in terms of devastation of the
Amazon.'

FT  23 MAR 92 / Bush and Kohl committed to early Gatt agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush of the US and Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany
yesterday committed themselves to reaching an early Gatt trade agreement,
but disclosed no new breakthrough in the protracted negotiations.
Reporting on two days of talks at Camp David, the presidential retreat, Mr
Kohl said he wanted an agreement 'by the end of April at the very latest'.
But he stressed he had not come to the US in any official negotiating
capacity.
He said he would report back to the heads of other European governments and
to Mr Jacques Delors, president of the European Commission.
Prior to Mr Kohl's arrival, the German government spokesman said the
Chancellor saw the possibility of a trade-off along the lines that the US
should accept a freeze on its sales of cereals substitutes to the EC, while
the Community would accept restrictions on its own exports.
All Mr Kohl would say was: 'Obviously, when we talk about compromise, both
sides have to move.' But he made it clear he felt a Gatt agreement would be
an essential precursor of the next economic summit due in Munich in July.
Mr Bush had little to say about Gatt in his remarks, except when pushed, at
the end of the press conference, with a domestic question contrasting his
unwillingness to compromise with Congress over economic reform with his
presumed inclination to cut a new world trade deal.
He then asserted that a new Gatt agreement would demonstrate his desire to
achieve 'change' in the world. Trade, he said, was more beneficial than
foreign aid for the neediest.
Perhaps the most extraordinary element of the press conference was Mr Kohl's
virtual endorsement of Mr Bush for re-election. 'I don't want to interfere
in US politics,' the Chancellor began, and then listed reasons why the
American people should pay attention to foreign policy.
'Had George Bush not proved to be such a strong leader,' Mr Kohl argued,
'all these dramatic changes would not have taken place in the world.'

FT  23 MAR 92 / Thatcher joins Tory assault: Former prime minister launches
scathing attack on Labour's policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS MARGARET Thatcher joined Mr John Major in a scathing assault yesterday
on Labour's 'socialist' prospectus for the 1990s as the Conservatives
relaunched a faltering general election campaign.
The much sharper edge to the attack - focused directly on Mr John Smith's
shadow budget - came as a clutch of weekend surveys confirmed that Labour
had held on to a small lead in the opinion polls.
Mr Major, with Mrs Thatcher alongside him at a London rally, launched what
colleagues promised would be an unrelenting onslaught on the opposition's
tax policies and on Mr Neil Kinnock's leadership.
Warning that an inconclusive election result leading to a 'hung' parliament
would 'hang the future of our country', Mrs Thatcher said: 'Everything that
we have gained could so easily be lost unless we are returned for a fourth
term.'
Their joint appearance, however, was dismissed by the Labour as a 'panic'
admission that it had seized the initiative. Mr Kinnock reaffirmed an
earlier prediction that his party would secure an overall majority of 20
seats on April 9. Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, said the
Conservatives' tactics showed clearly that they were 'rattled'.
Mr Major's speech, which followed a scathing denunciation by his predecessor
of Mr Kinnock's 'socialism', signalled the start of a determined and
abrasive campaign to win back the support of the skilled working classes.
Amid Conservative recognition that many of these so-called 'C2s' had been
reassured about Labour's intentions by Mr Smith's shadow Budget, Mr Major
widened the attack on the opposition's tax plans. Drawing on his party's
calculation that Labour would have to increase public spending by Pounds
38bn a year if it were to meet the commitments in its election manifesto,
the prime minister said every taxpayer would face an increase of Pounds
1,250 a year in his or her tax bill. Employing phrases which echoed the
unabashed rhetoric of Mrs Thatcher, he said Labour offered a 'hands-in-your
pockets Britain where you can only go so far before a Labour chancellor is
at your throat'.
The Pounds 1,250 figure, dismissed by Mr Kinnock as 'sheer fantasy', will be
at the centre of the Conservative approach for the remaining weeks of the
campaign. One senior official commented bluntly: 'We have to destroy John
Smith's Budget.'
Party strategists dismissed suggestions that a new series of polls showing
an average two-point Labour lead had forced them to rethink their approach.
They insisted that they had always judged it would take some time for their
message over taxation to 'sink in' with the electorate. But they accepted
that the election outcome now hinged on whether they were effective in
getting that message across during the remainder of the campaign.
Candidates attending yesterday's rally said a number of local party
associations had conveyed to Conservative central office their disquiet
about Labour's more effective campaigning. Others suggested that the party's
central organisation had underestimated the level of resentment caused by
the recession.
Mr Major's aides confirmed that from now until polling day he would maintain
a barrage of attacks on Labour policies.
Conservative strategists added that Mr Michael Heseltine, judged to be one
of the party's most effective campaigners, is to be given a central role in
the assault on the opposition's tax plans. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor,
was judged to have failed to match Mr Smith's political 'punches' during the
first week of the campaign and would move into the background.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Why the Financial Times has a new look
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CHANGES to section one of the Financial Times today represent the latest
in a series of design modifications aimed at improving the appearance and
usefulness of the newspaper.
In order to increase typographical clarity, we have increased the space
between lines of text throughout the newspaper.
We have also switched from an eight to a seven column grid on the front
page, the back page of section one and on certain features pages. This will
help us to display features and news reports more attractively. Compensating
changes have meant that these improvements will not involve any loss of
words.
The world news and business news summaries on the front page have been
replaced by a single column summarising all prime news items of interest to
FT readers. This column will continue to offer busy readers a two-minute
world news briefing.
We have also sought to improve the signposting of various elements in the
paper and to increase the orderliness of its five basic sections:
international news, UK news, features, company news and market news.
In the coming months, this will enable us to add new features and to extend
the statistical services of the newspaper.
We have tried to minimise changes to positions of regular items. From today,
however, an expanded appointments column will appear in section one of the
paper rather than on the back page of section two. It has been renamed
People and can be found today on page 14. All the other changes are aimed at
improving the appearance and readability of the newspaper.
A second phase in the redesign, mainly affecting section two, will appear in
the autumn.
Readers dislike changes in their daily newspaper, and we have deliberately
limited our redesign to the minimum necessary to achieve the goals of
greater clarity and orderliness. All the same, it will take a little time to
get used to the new look - especially the summary column on the front page,
which is one of the newspaper's best read and most valued features. Our
belief is that the benefits of the changes will become increasingly apparent
in the coming months. We hope that you will agree.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Kinnock says Labour is 'party of industry'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK set out Labour's agenda for the start of the second week of
election campaigning yesterday with a 'charm offensive' squarely targeted at
industry and commerce.
In a question and answer session with Labour-supporting business leaders at
London's Hilton Hotel, he said a Labour government would 'enable' business
but not interfere in it.
His business 'brunch' was hosted by Lord Hollick, managing director of MAI,
the financial services group, and also addressed by Mr Gordon Brown, the
shadow trade secretary. It was clearly aimed at portraying Labour as having
adopted the best practices of governments of all political colours in the
European Community.
However, amid a barrage of Tory attacks, Mr John Smith, the shadow
chancellor, had to correct comments by Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy
leader. On TV-am Mr Hattersley said an increase in Labour's proposed 50 per
cent top rate of income tax could not be ruled out. Mr Smith said the rate
would not rise above 50 per cent but failed to stem charges from
Conservative frontbenchers that Mr Hattersley had revealed a hidden agenda
of new tax rises.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, said the 'gaffe' had 'confirmed
what we suspected all along - that Labour are secretly planning to put up
taxes way beyond the levels they have admitted'.
Mr Kinnock's central theme - that Labour is now 'the party of industry' -
will be further developed at today's launch of the party's manufacturing
policy in the West Midlands.
Party strategists said they would build on Mr Kinnock's 'prime ministerial'
image and Labour's positive agenda, contrasting it with a Tory campaign
which, they said, had increasingly become negative attacks.
Opinion poll showing 'steady, inexorable movement' in Labour's favour had
panicked the Tories into deploying Mrs Margaret Thatcher to give 'backbone'
to a lacklustre campaign, Mr Kinnock said.
Looking confident and relaxed, he used yesterday's meeting to appeal for
business' support. He argued that, of all the EC governments, Britain's was
unique in believing 'the function of the state was to withdraw from all
responsibility' for business. Labour believed that government 'does have a
real role' in aiding the development of the economy and the manufacturing
base.
Asked by one businessman how nervous voters might be persuaded that Labour
would not adopt more radical policies once elected, Mr Kinnock said such a
move would be an exercise in suicidal 'throat slitting'.
Labour's goal was not merely to achieve office but to stay in office, he
said.
Labour's business brunch was attended by a 100-strong audience that included
Mr Denny Bernstein of Monarch Airlines, Ms Carmen Callil of Chatto and
Windus, Mr David Goldstone of Regalian Properties, Mr Paul Loach of
Framlington plc, Mr Michael Montague of Williams Holdings, Mr Brian Oakley
of Logica Cambridge, Mr Swraj Paul of Caparo Industries and Sir Sidney
Sternberg of Martin Slowe Estates.
Mr Smith later made clear that a Labour government would not set zero
inflation as its target, but would be content with a rate equal to the EC
average.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Banks back Pounds 100m emergency funding for Olympia &amp; York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York, the world's biggest property developer, which last night
admitted it has been facing a liquidity crisis, has raised more than Pounds
100m of emergency bank facilities to continue work on projects including its
Canary Wharf development, Europe's biggest office project.
The Canadian company said it would shortly hold talks with its leading bank
creditors on restructuring its worldwide debt, estimated at more than Pounds
5bn.
O&amp;Y said in addition to the emergency standby loans - of which Pounds 52m
was provided in London for Canary Wharf and the balance in Toronto for O&amp;Y
working capital - the group had arranged facilities to help retire CDollars
380m (Pounds 184m) of its outstanding commercial paper.
Some of these latter funds will come from the sale of the group's equity
stake in Interprovincial Pipelines, the leading Canadian oil pipeline
company. O&amp;Y has been unable to roll over the commercial paper due to what
the Dominion Bond Rating Service of Canada last week termed an
'unprecedented lack of investor confidence.'
The official said: 'Speculation surrounding the commercial paper programme
created a liquidity crisis which delayed arrangements for other sources of
finance.' The next step would be 'to move forward with discussions with our
banks', he said.
JP Morgan, the New York bank and a leading O&amp;Y creditor, is expected to be
named in the next few days as adviser to O&amp;Y on its debt restructuring.
A consortium of about 10 banks, including Barclays and Lloyds of the UK,
were encouraged by the Bank of England to put up the Pounds 52m for work to
continue at Canary Wharf.
It emerged yesterday that Mr Pen Kent, a director of the Bank of England,
had played a key role in funneling information from O&amp;Y and the Canadian
central bank to banks lending to the Canary Wharf project.
Bankers in London said that they had been encouraged by the Bank of England
to participate in the emergency funding, but denied they had been under
pressure to do so.
One banker said the request for the funds came at the beginning of last
week. 'They will be able to draw on the funds as they need them, but only in
consultation with the banks'. It is a short-term facility, lasting a few
months. The loan is secured on property at Canary Wharf and on other assets.
It has prior claim on O&amp;Y's assets ahead of the main Pounds 500m loan for
the construction of Canary Wharf, which was provided by a consortium of 12
banks, most of which are involved in the new smaller facility.
'The Canadian end (of O&amp;Y) had been feeding the cash requirements of Canary
Wharf', said another banker involved in providing the new funds yesterday.
'But the cash ran out', he added.
The sudden demand for the new UK money was said to have demonstrated that
O&amp;Y needed to restructure its worldwide borrowings, taken out from a total
of 70 banks. A meeting of its banks is likely within two weeks, probably in
Toronto.
One banker said that in any debt restructuring, O&amp;Y would probably be given
sufficient funds to finish those buildings already started at Canary Wharf.
'If I have my way, they would have to shelve everything else', he said.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of European Finance and Investment: Nordic Countries
(13): Monetary stability sought - Iceland: The economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ICELAND'S financial system may not yet have gone so far in a liberalising
direction as the other countries of the Nordic region but like them it has
also embarked on an intense period of deregulation as it prepares to
converge with the European Community's single integrated market.
Unlike the rest of the non-EC Nordic countries Iceland is unlikely to seek
full EC membership in the near future. However it does hope to benefit from
the creation of the 19-nation European Economic Area (EEA) which is expected
to integrate the economies of the EC with those of the European Free Trade
Association (Efta) from January 1 1993.
Iceland is set to gain 96 per cent customs-free access for its fish products
in that wider market and, as fish accounts for nearly 80 per cent of the
country's exports, it remains vital that the EEA works.
The most important financial change for Iceland concerns the relationship of
its currency to those of western Europe. The Icelandic government announced
last October that since two thirds of the country's foreign trade was with
the EC and European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries, and the other
Nordic nations had pegged their currencies to the European Currency Unit, it
intended to link the Icelandic krona to the Ecu as well - but not until
1993.
The first step was taken last month when Iceland's exchange rate basket was
reduced from 17 to three currencies consisting of the Ecu, the American
dollar and the Japanese yen with a relative weight of 76 per cent, 18 per
cent and 6 per cent respectively.
The government is also taking the first steps in the development of a
foreign exchange market for Iceland with powers being given to the country's
central bank to intervene and adjust the krona's daily exchange rate. A new
Central Bank Act is being prepared which will also enable the bank to
influence short-term market interest rates.
The government is apparently firm in its commitment to the establishment of
Icelandic monetary stability, an objective that has proved hard to achieve.
For most of the past 20 years, the economy has suffered from the
consequences of high inflation.
Stagnating export prices for fish in the late 1980s undermined efforts to
uphold the value of the krona and forced the government into periodic
devaluations to strengthen Iceland's balance of payments and secure some
market advantage for the vulnerable fishing industry. But since December
1989 the average exchange rate of the Icelandic krona has remained stable.
The present Icelandic government appears determined to stick to its
objective of monetary stability even if this has meant carrying out
increasingly unpopular economic policies that are squeezing real disposable
income and increasing registered unemployment.
Restrictive monetary measures have helped to keep down the annual rate of
inflation to single figures in 1991 for the second consecutive year - quite
an achievement for an economy that has had to live with an annual inflation
rate of 20-30 per cent since 1983. Forecasts for this year suggest Iceland
will maintain its relatively low inflation rate at about 2.5 per cent. If
this happens, it will take the country below the inflation average in the
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) countries, an
unfamiliar experience for Iceland.
But other economic indicators look grim. A 4.1 per cent cut in the country's
gross national product is expected this year with a 6.1 per cent decline in
national income which would be the biggest drop since 1950 and the fifth
successive year of stagnation. The current account deficit is expected to
amount to 4-5 per cent of Iceland's gross national product while the 1992
budget deficit will amount to 2.4 per cent of GNP; the same as last year.
The outlook for the all-important fishing industry is murky. Reduced fish
quotas are expected to lead to a 9 per cent decline in fish exports. At the
same time, the indefinite postponement announced last November in the
long-expected Atlantal project to build an aluminium plant in Iceland
producing 200,000 tons a year has hit hopes of economic diversification.
The lifting of controls on Iceland's financial system really gathered pace
after the mid-1980s with an important step being taken in August 1990 when
restrictions were lifted on long-term outward capital movements.
There has been the emergence of mutual funds and leasing companies and the
development of a securities exchange. The commercial banks themselves have
also gone through a radical reorganisation through merger and amalgamation
as their number has been reduced from seven to three. There are plans to
change the Agricultural Bank into a limited company with the state's shares
being offered to the public.
But the opening up of Iceland to outside financial influences has led to
some criticism from those who fear the small economy will be submerged as a
result. This is why the Icelandic government continues to be much more
cautious than its Nordic neighbours in its slow but steady move to greater
liberalisation.
Last March, for example, new legislation was introduced to encourage foreign
direct investment into Iceland but it was made clear that only Icelanders or
domestically registered companies had access to the country's fishing
grounds and primary fish processing industry.
Again, foreigners cannot acquire the right to harness waterfalls and
geo-thermal energy. And non-residents must not acquire more than a 49 per
cent stake in Iceland's domestic airlines. Investment by foreigners in
domestic incorporated commercial banks is also restricted to 25 per cent
although foreign commercial banks have been free to open branches from the
beginning of this year.

(14): Useful role as a go-between - Nordic Investment Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Nordic Investment Bank has at least one positive attribute at the
moment. It is the only bank in the region which still enjoys a triple A
rating for its bonds from the leading credit rating institutions Moodys and
Standard &amp; Poors.
Established on August 2 1976 with a head office in Helsinki by the
governments of the five Nordic countries, the NIB'S aim is to finance on
normal banking terms investment projects in and outside the Nordic area. Its
lending facilities are financed by borrowing on both Nordic and
international capital markets.
During the first eight months of last year, the NIB made a profit of SDR25m
or Dollars 34m. Its total assets were SDR6.058bn while its interest income
stood at SDR326.1m.
The bank is suffering from no credit losses although it has SDR3.420bn in
outstanding loans. But as Mr Jannik Lindbaek, the NIB's president, explains,
the bank is not competing with high street or savings banks. It covers only
investments that have an interest normally covering more than one Nordic
country and these tend to have strong financial support from both the public
and private sectors.
'The NIB has been a dynamic force in cross-frontier integration in our
region', says Mr Lindbaek. 'In the past five years we have doubled our
lending portfolio'. He sees the bank as a complement to other sources of
finance in the Nordic area. The NIB is interested not in short-term funding
but in medium and long-term loans with maturities of between five and 15
years.
Just over half the NIB's disbursements go into manufacturing projects with
an estimated 40 per cent of loans in 1990 made in the funding of corporate
acquisitions inside and beyond the Nordic region.
Increasingly environmental projects have become a dominant concern for the
banks lending policy. They accounted for 20 per cent of all NIB's
disbursements in 1990. This is due not only to the genuine anxiety about
pollution levels felt throughout the Nordic region but the recognition that
loans are available from the NIB to clean up the environment even if an
investment scheme affects only one Nordic country directly.
The NIB explains: 'The reasoning behind this is that most types of pollution
do not stop at country borders'. Recent loans in the environmental sector
have included a SKr300m contribution in the Swedish paper group MoDo's
SKr1.5bn project designed to reduce emissions of oxygen-consuming and
chloride particles into the Gulf of Bothnia and Baltic sea from four
facilities on Sweden's east coast; a DKr29m contribution to the DKr80m
development of a waste water purification plant in east Jutland, Denmark;
and a FM29m loan for a desulphurisation facility in an energy plant at Espoo
in Finland.
In October 1990, the NIB established the Nordic Environment Finance
Corporation with the purpose of providing share capital or loans for joint
environmental ventures of central and eastern Europe. It has had a modest
beginning with an authorised capital of SDR36m for a six-year trial period.
Ten years ago, project loan investment facilities were started by the NIB
with SDR100m of long-term loans of up to 20 years disbursed each year to
credit-worthy developing countries in the Third World as well as central and
eastern Europe.
The NIB has also been involved in a Nordic region government-based task
force set up in September 1990 after an environmental conference at Ronnerby
in Sweden. The task force is examining ways of financing projects to purify
the polluted Baltic sea by encouraging co-operation between the Nordic
countries and their eastern neighbours.
So-called 'hot spots' have been defined where pollution is the most severe
and the financial needs are the greatest. The area of greater St Petersburg
as well as the industrial regions of Katowice in Poland and Ostrawa in
Czechoslovakia have been highlighted as 'super hot' and in need of urgent
action. The NIB is not alone as a source of financial support in the wider
environmental picture of northern Europe. The European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and the European Investment Bank are also
involved.
But the NIB is being used to draw attention to the desperate need for
capital infrastructure investment on the edge of the Nordic region. It has
produced, for example, two invaluable studies of investment plans and needs
in the three independent Baltic states of Latvia, Estonia and Lithuania. The
idea of creating a Baltic Investment Bank with access to the international
money markets jointly owned by NIB and the Baltic countries is being
floated.
Mr Lindbaek stresses that NIB has only limited resources and cannot become a
large multilateral lending institution. But even while it remains modest,
the NIB can still perform a useful role in acting as a go-between for the
Baltic countries as well as in the Third World where many aid schemes
received the bank's support.

(11): The losses mount up - Norway: Banks have been doing badly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST YEAR Christiania Bank, Den norske Bank and Fokus Bank, Norway's top
three commercial banks, posted combined net losses of NKr16bn, a four-fold
increase on 1990.
Combined losses on loans and guarantees shot up to NKr13.35bn from NKr8bn,
as net interest income dipped to NKr8.58bn from NKr9.56bn.
However, last year's losses were not restricted to commercial banks. The
savings banks sustained losses on loans and guarantees in 1991 of NKr4.17bn,
or 2.07 per cent of assets, compared with NKr4.54bn in 1990 and NKr4.75bn in
1989.
Combined savings banks' operating losses rose to NKr1.96bn last year, or
0.97 per cent of assets, from NKr1.08bn in 1990 and NKr580m in 1989.
Sparebanken Nor, Norway's biggest savings bank, known internationally as
Union Bank of Norway, saw net losses increase by NKr188m to NKr806m.
Although loan losses were reduced by NKr123m to NKr1.54bn, non-performing
loans swelled to NKr3bn from NKr2.3bn, representing a loss of NKr100m in
interest income alone.
The state-backed Bank Investment Fund - which is different from the
state-backed Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) - agreed to invest NKr700m in a
convertible bond as part of a deal in which Sparebanken Nor will acquire
Sparebank Kreditt, a mortgage company.
This is the Investment Fund's first placement since it was set up last
autumn. Separate plans call for the Investment Fund to guarantee full
subscription of a preferential share issue to be launched by DnB as part of
a deal in which it acquired Realkreditt, a mortgage group.
The commercial banks face new problems as well as lingering ones such as
soaring costs and dwindling earnings. In a long uphill struggle to improve
earnings, they have suffered draconian demands from the state, their new
owner, as they are under-capitalised in an over-banked market.
Some of the difficulties, however, are more of a psychological nature,
arising out of their new 'national' status. There is a trend for customers
to be less willing to service loans after the state last year transferred
large sums of money - about 1 per cent of mainland GDP - to prop up the
banks.
According to Mr Tormod Hermansen, chief of BIF, with the knowledge that the
state has injected taxpayers' money into the banking system, customers think
they may be paying for the banks' sins twice.
Another problem - which the banks can do little to influence - is the
structure of the industry. Until now there has been muted political
discussion about this. 'Norway's policy. . . is based on an implicit
commitment to maintain three big commercial banks. This policy is 10 years
old and outdated,' one banker points out.
Some banks would like a political consensus allowing one or two strong banks
to emerge with agreement on market share based on an implicit understanding
that foreign competition will increase in the 1990s.
The Norwegian Banks' Association estimates that if a joint giro payment
system was used by the commercial banks, savings banks and the post-savings
bank, annual savings of NKr1.5bn could be achieved. In the meantime, the
banks' earnings potential continues to be obstructed by the effects of
Norway's recessionary economy.
Unemployment, including those on government training schemes, is nearly 9
per cent, a post-war record, and there are bankruptcies, commercial and
private, continue to set new records. Commercial bankruptcies rose by 29 per
cent in 1991.
The value of real estate, the main source of the banks' collateral for
loans, has dropped in the past five years by an estimated 40 per cent,
forcing the banks to make big write-offs against accounts. During 1987-91,
housing investment was halved as households struggled to reduce
indebtedness. Fixed investment in the mainland economy since 1987 has
plunged by 35 per cent. The Central Bureau of Statistics sees 1.6 per cent
growth in mainland economy GDP this year while investments may rise 7 per
cent by 1993, from minus 2 per cent in 1991-92.
According to Christiania Bank, a further decrease in investment in
commercial property is expected in 1992, but by 1993 the fall may level off.
The top three are also struggling to stem continuous rises in non-performing
loans, which reached NKr25.8bn by the end of last year, up NKr2.6bn since
the end of 1990.
The banks have general loan loss reserve funds called 'en bloc' funds. For
the three banks, at the end of 1991, combined loan loss reserve funds were
NKr6bn, compared with NKr4.1bn at the end of 1990. However, in terms of
capital adequacy there is no legal Norwegian definition of the reserves to
determine whether they count as core capital, tier capital or if they are
neutral.
'If these reserves are included in defining the capital adequacy of the
bank, it would overstate the solidity of the banks,' says one banker.
Norway's banking system saw state transfers of close to NKr20bn last year,
but the banks need additional capital. Fokus Bank says that it expects the
BIF to provide fresh support in 1992 while Christiania Bank estimates it
needs NKr2.5bn just to meet new capital adequacy requirements. Analysts
believe the bank would be better off if it got more than NKr5bn.
Further state transfers of between NKr5-10bn are not being ruled out for the
ailing banks. But DnB says that it has no plans to make a new call on the
BIF.
In the struggle to reduce costs, the three banks have cut 3,436 jobs since
1989 to a total of 13,292. In the last three years operating costs by the
three amounted to NKr31bn. DnB is the only one of the three which has
managed to reduce operating costs. Since 1989 these have fallen by NKr870m
to NKr4.97bn at the end of last year. Christiania's costs rose by NKr700m in
the period while Fokus saw a NKr290m increase.
Mr Hermansen believes it may take up to four years before the banks make
sufficient earnings to service their equity capital on a stable basis. By
that time they will face a new competitor; this year the government plans to
establish a post bank.

(12): Beleaguered and disfigured - The banking system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S beleaguered banks, disfigured by successive record annual losses,
are glad to see the back of last year. But 1992 holds little promise for any
big improvement.
Last year, Norway was forced to virtually nationalise its banking system.
Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank, respectively the second and third biggest
banks, saw their share capital wiped out while Den norske Bank (DnB), the
biggest, was barely saved from technical insolvency by a complex
re-capitalisation bail-out orchestrated by the state.
However, Mr Hermod Skaanland, governor of the central bank, issued a warning
last month when he said that the crisis within the banking system would not
be solved until the banks were in a position to raise capital in the private
market on a commercial basis.
'The state's engagement (in the banking system) must be wound down as soon
as possible,' Mr Skaanland said in his annual speech on the state of the
domestic economy.
In 1991, the Oslo bourse's bank sub-index saw prices plummet 79 per cent.
After deregulation in the 1980s, which fuelled competition among the banks
bordering on the extreme, they became prey to a euphoric expansion in the
Norwegian economy and among themselves which has ended in dispiriting
declines.
According to the Norwegian Banks' Association, combined net losses by the
commercial banks, its members, last year hit NKr15.882bn - a near four-fold
increase from 1990 when they were NKr4.3bn. In 1989, losses were just
NKr326m.
Credit losses last year soared to NKr12.362bn, up from NKr8.221bn in 1990
and NKr7.407bn in 1989. But the picture is even worse if the savings banks
and secondary finance institutions are taken into account.
According to the Banking Insurance and Securities Commission (BISC), the
country's finance watchdog, combined credit losses accelerated to NKr19.8bn
in 1991, up from NKr12.3bn in 1990, while operating losses increased to
beyond NKr17bn from NKr6.5bn in 1990.
'The problems within the banking system have seriously rocked the political
establishment,' said Mr Arne Oeien, former Labour oil minister, who is now
secretary-general of the Finance Ministry.
Mr Oeien forms half of a dynamic duo - his partner is Mr Tormod Hermansen,
chairman of the year-old state-backed Bank Insurance Fund (BIF) -
responsible for designing last year's big bank rescue package and overseeing
the state's new bank acquisitions.
BIF was allocated state funds of NKr11bn in 1991 to help prop up the banks
but the fund has been reduced to about NKr500m-NKr600m by calls made upon
it. Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank have warned that they will need
additional state appropriations if new capital adequacy rules are to be met
by the end of the year. Christiania alone says it needs NKr2.5bn just to
abide by the new rules which are based on the Bank for International
Settlements (BIS) standards.
Mr Oeien is more optimistic about the future of the banks than Mr Hermansen
who believes that it will take the rest of this decade before the their
health can be restored to allow profitability and growth which in turn can
fuel private investor interest.
'Norway's banking industry is in a very deep crisis which has proven to be
worse than feared and will last longer than what many people are willing to
believe,' Mr Hermansen said recently.
His pessimistic outlook is based in part on his forecast of a lack of solid
growth within the Norwegian economy until the end of the 1990s and the
necessity for a big restructuring of the banking industry which has yet to
take off.
Mr Oeien believes there is a good chance that further state appropriations
to DnB may not be necessary in 1992.
Last year, Norway's taxpayers and the bank's own security funds coughed up
close to NKr20bn to prop up the ailing banks through subsidised loans and
state cash transfers. Christiania Bank, which the government had sought to
sell, but failed, required NKr7.864bn alone. Fokus and DnB also had massive
support.
It still remains unclear if the ownership of Christiania Bank will remain in
Norwegian hands. Clouds over the bank seem darker than those over Fokus and
DnB.
The government is determined to keep DnB out of complete control of the
state although its ownership in the bank is already pushing 80 per cent.
'For DnB and for Norway it is important to keep at least part of the bank's
ownership in private hands,' says Mr Hermansen.
'For Christiania the losses were so high that there was virtually nothing
left of the bank. . . it was just too far gone to allow a symbolic value to
be retained. . . but I will admit that we were surprised over the size of
DnB's 1991 losses,' he said.
For Fokus Bank there are some positive signs: the bank's leadership has
adopted a realistic strategy and reorganisation, according to Mr Hermansen,
in which an association of banks have been established where each bank is
responsible for its performance.
However, Mr Hermansen and Mr Oeien both believe that DnB and Christiania
need to do more to improve efficiency, cut costs and boost profitability.
But the banks' future development will hinge greatly on the development of
the domestic economy. Unemployment, including those on government training
schemes, is at a post-war record high of nearly 9 per cent, while corporate
and private bankruptcies continue to swell to new record levels. Wage levels
are far above those of Norway's trading partners and export industries have
been hard hit by the international recession.
One thing is certain; Norway's banking industry in the year 2000 will be
quite different than what it is today and Mr Hermansen intends to play a
leading role in shaping its new structure. But at this point, not even a
whisper can be heard about the timing of re-privatisation of Norway's
banking system.

(10): For the customers - Profile: PFA Pension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Andre Lublin, managing director of PFA Pension, Denmark's largest private
pension and life assurance group for corporate pensions, shoots out
questions about his rivals, which are not entirely rhetorical, with the
speed of a machine gun.
'Who are they serving? Their shareholders? Their staff? Their customers?'.
As to his own company, he has not a moment's doubt. The first thing he
points out is that his group's share capital is precisely DKr1m and the
articles of association prevent it from paying more than DKr50,000 in
dividends.
The implication is clear: anyone who has a policy with a company paying
hundreds of millions in dividends to shareholders should think again.
'We exist for our customers,' says Mr Lublin, 'We have the highest yield,
lowest cost, and lowest prices for insurance cover. And we give the best
service.'
PFA Pension was founded in 1917 jointly by a group of employers'
associations and salaried staff associations, which explains its special
structure with a minimal share capital and its complete dedication to its
customers.
Modesty is not Mr Lublin's style - at least, not when he is talking about
PFA Pension. But he has something to boast about. It is arguably the most
successful Danish financial institution of the past decade.
Under Mr Lublin's stewardship, it has grown fast, and growth has come by
winning a rising market share, not by acquisitions. PFA has shunned
diversification into other types of business.
Its market share has increased from 20.1 per cent in 1988 to 24.5 per cent
in 1991. Premium income increased by DKr700m to DKr4.06bn in 1991, while
income for its chief rival, Danica increased by DKr250m to DKr4.37bn. Owned
by Baltica, Danica is the result of a merger of Baltica's life and pension
business with the former Statsanstalten, which until privatisation in 1990
was a state fund. Mr Lublin is confident that in 1992 PFA Pension will pass
Danica.
PFA tops the yield league for life and pension savings companies, with a
1990 yield of 13.60 per cent, reduced to 8.50 per cent by a special Danish
tax on pension and life assurance savings. The group's costs are only 6 per
cent of premium income, a low figure by any standards. One reason for the
low costs is that PFA deals with corporate and group pension and group
insurance for relatively low-risk people. Companies which cater for the
individual market think Mr Lublin is a little unfair when he points out that
their costs are much higher than his.
PFA's position as one of the largest money silos in Denmark, with total
assets of about DKr55bn and an investment budget of more than DKr5bn in
1992, makes it an interesting target for international investment managers.
The Danish life and pension funds only began to invest in foreign securities
in 1989. The sums invested abroad are now quite substantial.
In 1992, PFA will place about DKr300m in foreign equities out of a total
budget for equities investment of DKr700m. About DKr500m will go into
foreign bonds. The aim is to increase the share of the investment budget
going into non-Danish securities from 15 per cent at present to 20-25 per
cent within a few years.

(9): A clear contrast - The Rivals: Danske Bank vs Unibank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEN Danske Bank shocked the Danish public in February when it simultaneously
reported a sizeable DKr1.3bn profit and announced that it was going to cut
its staff by 20 per cent from 15,000 to 12,000 over the coming three years.
It gave staff three months to consider offers of redundancy payments or,
alternatively, face the risk that some of them would be dismissed.
Danske, the result of a merger in 1990 of the former Danske Bank, Copenhagen
Handelsbank and Provinsbanken, has established itself firmly in the lead as
the country's biggest bank, with a balance sheet total of DKr363bn to the
Unidanmark group's DK263bn. Unidanmark is the result of a 1990 merger
between Privatbanken, SDS and Andelsbanken.
The announcement of staff reductions, however, was in keeping with the
disciplined culture of the bank. It is a culture which is reflected in a
cautious lending policy, a conservative loss provisions policy, and a policy
of sticking to doing what it knows best. It has avoided grand alliances,
either with banks in other countries or with non-bank financial
institutions, such as insurance and mortgage credit associations, at home.
The bank has not ignored the potential from insurance and mortgage credit
business, but is proceeding cautiously. It has a pilot project together with
the Hafnia insurance group for selling standard accident policies from bank
branches. It has set up its own life assurance company to help it attract
long-term savings, and it is offering bond-backed, fixed interest mortgage
credit to its own customers.
There is a clear contrast between Danske and its rival. Unibank accepts
bigger risks. It has, for example, a larger portfolio of property-related
loans than Danske, and these go some way to explaining why the bank
increased provisions to DKr5.4bn in 1991, some 3.1 per cent of loans and
guarantees. 'Asset quality' was given as a reason when Moody's, the US
rating agency, announced in February that it was reviewing Unibank's Aa2
long-term credit rating. Standard &amp; Poor's also has Unibank under review.
A few days before publishing its 1991 results, Unibank announced a
strengthening of its central credit control function. The purpose is to
provide a better overview of the credit policies of its four divisions
(domestic banking, merchant banking, trade and international divisions).
'We have introduced slightly more distance between the sellers of credit and
the credit assessment function,' said Mr Steen Rasborg, Unidanmark's chief
executive.
The measure was announced in an eight-page internal paper to all employees,
a paper which also suggested that any employees, at whatever level, who
found difficulty in accepting management decisions should reconsider their
position with the bank.
The climate and morale among employees is excellent, explained Mr Rasborg,
but the merger process had inevitably left a few people dissatisfied,
including one or two who aired their views in the media. 'All we are saying
now is that we don't want to hear any more complaining,' said Mr Rasborg.
Unibank believes in alliances. It is involved in the Scandinavian Banking
Partner alliance with Den norske Bank and Skandinaviska-Enskilda Bank and it
plans to become part of a gigantic financial services group together with
mortgage credit association Nykredit and Tryg, the insurance company.
Nykredit and Tryg have already merged under a holding company. Danish
legislation has so far hindered Unidanmark from joining them, but Mr Rasborg
says that when the European Community's fifth company law directive comes
into force, Danish law will have to be amended to permit the tie-up.
The reason for Danske's decision to reduce its staff so substantially is
found in the bank's meagre net interest earnings and earnings from fees and
commissions, which declined from DKr10.22bn in 1990 to DKr9.82bn in 1991m.
Earnings per krone of operating expenses fell from DKr1.64 to DKr1.54
compared with DKr1.58 for Unidanmark.
Looking ahead, said Mr Knud Sorensen, chief executive, budgets showed that
this was an unsatisfactory level of primary operating profits, requiring
action to ensure that profits return to a more satisfactory level.
'We want to see sound basic earnings,' he said. Earnings per krone of costs
should be Dkr1.75-2.00, putting them in line with the performance of the
more profitable Swedish banks, he told the Financial Times. The planned
staff reductions should mean an improvement in earnings of DKr800m-900m, he
said.
The other large banks, including Unibank, managed to increase net interest
and fee income last year.
Among explanations put forward by Mr Sorensen for Danske's relatively poor
performance on this count were that the relatively high quality of the
lending portfolio may be reflected in the prices that the bank can take;
tough competition for corporate sector loans in a market which increasingly
international; failure of the economy to grow significantly; and the decline
of the retail market, which now accounts for about 25 per cent of lending
compared with 40 per cent a few years ago.
This latter point reflects the fact that low inflation (only 2.5 per cent in
1991) and changes in the income tax regime have made saving worthwhile and
borrowing much less attractive than it used to be, which has helped turn
Denmark's long-standing deficit on the balance of payments current account
into a surplus but has significantly changed the climate in which the banks
must operate.
Where Danske managed to pull ahead was on its provisions, which were reduced
to DKr2.88bn, or 1.45 per cent of loans and guarantees, from DKr4.25bn in
1990, when the figure was inflated partly by the process of bringing the
provisions policy of the three merging banks into line with each other.

(8): Lesson of the high capital ratio - Denmark: The banks

DENMARK'S banking and other financial institutions are in a less worrying
state than those in other Nordic countries. No leading banks have had to be
rescued by the government, and the many smaller banks and savings banks
which have found themselves in serious difficulties in the past few years
have almost all been absorbed by larger colleagues without too much trouble.
Nevertheless, the banks are not earning enough for their long-term health.
The average return on equity was under 1 per cent and in both 1990 and 1991
loss provisions averaged about 2 per cent of loans and guarantees.
Of the big four banks, which account for about 80 per cent of all bank
business, the best performance was a 6.5 per cent pre-tax return on equity
capital by the country's biggest bank, Den Danske Bank. The second-largest,
the Unidanmark group, made a negative return of 9.6 per cent, while the
Jutland-based Jyske Bank made a return of 0.8 per cent and Bikuben, flagship
of the savings bank movement, reported a negative return of 0.04 per cent.
It is generally accepted that the country has too many banks (with over 70
banks and almost twice as many savings banks), too many people working in
them and too many branches.
As the opportunities for stepping up earnings by widening interest margins
and charging higher fees and commissions are limited, the way ahead lies
through cutting costs and reducing personnel.
The 1990 mergers, which turned the six largest banks into two super-banks,
Den Danske Bank and Unidanmark (the name of the group holding company:
Unibank is the name of the bank), paved the way for rationalising the branch
network. Danske is reducing the network from 750 to about 550-600, Unibank
from 700 to 500. Both banks will have slimmed employment by 10 per cent by
the end of this year as compared with the pre-merger levels.
Danske, however, has recognised that the preliminary cost-cutting exercise
was not sufficient. It announced last month that it would reduce staff by 20
per cent, from 15,000 to 12,000, over the next three years, setting the pace
for the rest of the banks.
The large insurance-based groups, Baltica, Hafnia and Topdanmark, are not
performing well either, and this is not primarily a reflection of the
results of the core insurance business. Shareholders are paying the price
for adventurous managements, and criticism is rife of the failure of
supervisory boards to keep a tighter rein on managements.
Baltica and Topdanmark's managements were gripped in the mid-1980s by an
urge to diversify their operations into banking, real estate agencies,
vehicle rescue operations and even travel bureaux. None of these activities
has been a success, and some have caused considerable losses while occupying
valuable management resources.
Hafnia has stuck more closely to the business with which it is familiar, but
its earnings and financial position have been adversely affected by an
unsuccessful attempt to gain control of Baltica by buying up a third of the
equity and also by its heavy investment in Sweden's Skandia. The costs of
these investments will be reflected in a substantial loss when the 1991
results are published.
The investment in Baltica followed an attempt at an agreed merger between
the two largest Danish insurers. It fell through because the two chief
executives could not agree who should become top dog. 'In companies which
are properly run, the chairmen of the supervisory boards would have arranged
the merger first and dealt with the personality problems last, and would not
have left the fate of the negotiations to the chief executives,' commented
one of Denmark's most experienced bankers.
The good news is that Denmark's bond-issuing mortgage credit institutions,
which play a leading role on the financial scene, seem to have come through
a troubled period, caused by falling property prices and new reserve and
loss provision requirements, and can now look forward to quieter and more
successful times. Both the largest institutions, Kreditforening Danmark and
Nykredit, were back in profit in 1991. They expect to stay there.
Danish bankers and officials have a number of explanations as to why the
country's banks have survived the past few years with fewer troubles than
their Nordic colleagues, even though the Danish recession, which began in
1986-87, was just as steep as in the other countries. Above all, the
capitalisation ratio at Danish banks has always been high. The minimum legal
capital ratio has been 7 per cent since the 1930s. The definition was even
tougher than the figure suggests, as became apparent when the new BIS rules
were applied to the Danish banks: the average capitalisation ratio under BIS
rules turned out to be 13.6 per cent. It now averages 11.2 per cent and the
legal minimum ratio is, for the time being, 10 per cent.
For years, the banks complained that the capitalisation ratio placed them at
a disadvantage internationally. 'But', said Mr Sten Rasborg, chief general
manager of Unibank, 'We have subsequently had to thank Mr Erik Hoffmeyer,
governor of the National Bank (central bank), for maintaining the high
ratio.'
Other factors which helped the Danish banks include the gradual
liberalisation of the financial markets over a long period, starting in the
early 1970s; an economic crisis in the early 1980s, including declining
property prices, which gave the banks and the authorities valuable
experience when they faced new problems in the late 1980s; and efficient
supervisors with a long history of assessing the banks' big risks, which
meant that the banks' asset quality was relatively sound.
Times are still not easy, but the economy is staging a slow recovery and the
banks generally expect to see bad loss provisions fall to more manageable
proportions in 1992-93.

(7): Rigorous checks - Sweden: Financial services regulation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THESE are grim days for Sweden's Financial Supervisory Authority, the
country's main financial services regulator. With the banking sector
groaning under the strain of huge credit losses, the FSA has been forced to
introduce more rigorous - and more frequent - checks on Sweden's financial
institutions.
Combined credit losses among the banks, finance companies, mortgage
institutions and securities houses grew by a staggering SKr30.3bn to
SKr48.1bn in 1991. The banks account for the lion's share with SKr35.6bn in
credit losses (equivalent to 2.9 per cent of total outstanding loans),
compared with SKr10.8bn in 1990 and SKr2.8bn in 1989.
Concern over the scale of the credit losses, mainly in relation to the real
estate sector where prices have plummeted, has prompted the FSA to introduce
new reporting standards.
Lenders already had to outline details of large loans (those exceeding 10
per cent of their capital base) every six months and provide monthly balance
sheet statements. Now, they also have to provide monthly details of their
non-performing loans, defined as loans where there has been no interest
payment for 60 days or a lower-than-agreed interest payment.
'The reporting of non-performing loans provides the regulators with a better
view of the market,' says one financial analyst who follows the Swedish
banking sector.
In cases where real estate is used as security for a loan, the lender has to
obtain independent professional valuations for the property. With effect
from January 1992, these figures have to be published in the lender's annual
report.
The FSA points out that by requesting independent valuations for property
used as collateral, the real estate is less likely to be valued too
leniently in today's falling market, although Mr Kjell Arvidsson, head of
the FSA's financial markets department, emphasises that none of the banks is
in the situation of having to sell properties at present.
Nevertheless, the feeling remains that many of the banks have been too
reckless in their lending. 'They chased after borrowers irrespective of
their creditworthiness as soon as the restrictions on lending were lifted
during the second half of the 1980s,' says one banking analyst.
The FSA says banks were not careful enough with their credit analyses in
many cases, and did not make sure that the borrower was sound. In addition,
some banks discovered subsequently that their back office work was so poor
that when problems arose they had no idea whether they were legally in a
position to take over property which they had assumed was their collateral.
So far, the problems have arisen mainly in the commercial real estate
sector, but some bankers are worried that if unemployment continues to rise
in Sweden, the incidence of private debt and mortgage defaults could rise
sharply.
The outlook certainly remains gloomy. 'As it looks now, there will be big
problems, but maybe the market will have to take it,' warns Mr Arvidsson.

<TEXT>
MR Christopher Wegelius is famous on two fronts in Finland: as a world-class
equestrian and as head of Skopbank, the clearing bank for Finland's savings
banks.
While Finns talk proudly of the show-jumping prizes which he won, it is in
banking that he came a cropper after Skopbank foundered in the worst banking
disaster in Finland's post-war history.
Mr Wegelius rose from managing director to the position of chief general
manager and chairman of the board at Skopbank in 1990. The bank already had
a reputation for its aggressive buying and selling of its minority
shareholdings in Finnish companies. However, Skopbank's luck ran out with
its exposure to Tampella, a loss-making forestry group which the bank had
hoped to return to profit.
Skopbank was hit by losses on its share portfolio, and the Bank of Finland
was forced to step in and supervise a FM1.8bn injection of capital by the
savings banks to cover Skopbank's potential losses in November 1990.
'In the end, that wasn't enough and the situation grew worse' admits a Bank
of Finland official. Skopbank faced an acute liquidity crisis as its
interbank lines were cut. In September 1991, the Bank of Finland took
control in an attempt to limit the damage to Finland's reputation in the
international financial markets. 'The central bank simply had to take over
Skopbank - it was worried about how Skopbank's collapse might affect Finnish
borrowers in the international capital markets,' says Mr Jyrki Laakso, head
of the international department at the Finnish Bankers' Association.
'If Skopbank had faced a very serious funding problem it could have spread
to affect the whole of the Finnish banking system,' says Mr Kaarlo Jannari,
the new chairman and chief executive officer at Skopbank where he is on
'temporary leave' from the Bank of Finland.
Mr Jannari was head of the Bank of Finland's financial markets department,
monitoring risk in the banking system, but took over after Mr Wegelius
resigned and the Bank of Finland came to the rescue.
The Bank of Finland set up three separate holding companies: one owns the
shares in Skopbank itself; a second, Solidium, contains all of Skopbank's
shareholdings and outstanding loans to Tampella; and the third, Sponda,
contains Skopbank's largest real estate holdings.
Today, the Bank of Finland is the majority shareholder of Skopbank with 52.9
per cent of the share capital and 63.6 per cent of the voting power.
Finland's savings banks, who between them used to control 78.6 per cent of
the share capital and 91.7 per cent of the votes, have had their total
holding reduced to 37.1 per cent of the share capital and 33.4 per cent of
the votes.
The remaining shares (formerly corresponding to 21.4 per cent of the capital
and 8.3 per cent of the votes, but now representing 10.1 per cent of the
capital and 3 per cent of the votes) are publicly owned.
The Bank of Finland is keen to find a new owner for Skopbank since the
country's central bank can no longer be seen as wholly neutral in the money
market while it has a controlling stake in a bank.
'Skopbank's main attraction is its links with the savings bank network,'
says one securities analyst. So far, three suitors have emerged: Union Bank
of Finland, Okobank (the co-operative banking group) and Postipankki (the
post office bank). The three are expected to submit their bids and outline
their plans in March before serious negotiations begin.
For Union Bank of Finland, which has a strong corporate customer base and a
large retail market concentrated mainly in the big cities, co-operation with
the savings banks through Skopbank could provide it with a wider regional
network. That could prove an advantage if Union Bank of Finland were to link
up with an insurance group - as it is quite likely to do in future - since
it would provide greater access for selling insurance products outside the
main cities.
The co-operative banking organisation has traditionally been the sworn enemy
of the savings banks outside the main cities. 'Out in the countryside, the
only banks you see are the savings banks and the co-operative banks as they
have the largest regional networks, and that's where they fight their trench
warfare,' says one banker. He adds that while these two banking groups
answer for about 60 per cent of Finland's total individual deposits
nationwide, in the countryside their share is closer to 90 per cent.
Analysts believe that a link-up between the co-operative and savings banks
would provide the opportunity for a much-needed rationalisation in an
overbanked - and overstaffed - market. But merging co-operative and savings
banks would not be easy, not merely because the two banking groups are so
hostile to each other.
Legally it is impossible at present to merge the two kinds of banking
structures, but that could change soon. A government committee is currently
preparing new legislation which would enable savings and co-operative banks
to merge or to convert into commercial banks.
Skopbank's other suitor is Postipankki, the state-owned post office bank.
While Postipankki has only a few dozen branches nationwide, it has access to
a wider market over the post office counters.
Bankers point out that Postipankki may be considering whether it would be
cheaper to have its own network (in other words the savings banks) than to
continue with its post office branch network.
The Skopbank affair erupted at a time when Finland's banks were facing
terrible problems as a result of the recession and low interest margins, and
the combination of these factors is prompting several changes in the banking
sector.
For a start, there are plans to set up a state deposit guarantee fund. This
would provide a back-up to the existing deposit guarantee funds (for the
commercial, savings and co-operative banks) which each have between
FM200m-400m available to bail out troubled members.
The central bank is keen to set up a new fund so that if a bank fails and
uses up the appropriate deposit guarantee fund, the state can step in with
the necessary money. The idea is that eventually the relevant group of banks
would have to pay back the money to the state.
When it comes to exposure, bankers hope that risks will be reduced in
future. The Bank of Finland criticises the previous Skopbank management for
having a strategy which was 'too risk-prone and speculative'.
Skopbank's problem was its overall exposure to Tampella: Finnish banks are
not allowed to own more than 10 per cent in a company, but Skopbank
succeeded in circumventing those rules by building up its stake via
associated companies.
Bankers are keen to adopt EC banking regulations which would allow a bank to
own 100 per cent of a non-financial company, as long as it does not account
for more than 10 per cent of the bank's capital.
'If this rule was applied in Finland it would be quite prudent,' says Mr
Jannari. He argues that when the Finnish financial markets were deregulated
in the mid-1980s, there should have been a simultaneous improvement in the
Finnish banking supervision and regulatory legislation to fit the new
environment, with particular attention paid to risk concentration and
capital adequacy.
Already, the decline in banks' profitability stemming from the dramatic rise
in credit losses has forced the Banking Supervision Board to introduce new
reporting requirements. There are two main changes:
Banks have to report large exposures twice a year, rather than once a year
(as was the case before 1990); and
Non-performing loans must be reported monthly, whereas banks did not have to
report these at all before.
A non-performing loan is defined as one where there has been no interest
payment for 90 days or amortisation.
'It was important to standardise the definition of non-performing loans
because these grew dramatically last year,' says Mr Risto Maattanen, deputy
director-general of the Banking Supervision Board.
Although the market is not informed of the monthly figures, the banks do
have to report their non-performing loans in their annual reports now, which
is a new step.
'We can't change the economic environment, but the least we can do is be
honest to ourselves and the public. There is not a single problem-free bank
and we see it as a very dangerous situation as a whole' says Mr Maattanen.
Banking analyst Mr Roger Kempe of Evli Securities welcomes the changes which
have been introduced so far. 'The banking supervision has strengthened its
grip and is demanding more information so that it has a stronger control
over the banks,' he says.
'Sometimes in the past, it seemed as though the banks didn't give out the
information that was important, but now the rules have changed and the
banking supervision has become very strict and demanding.'
Currently under the control of the Ministry of Finance, the banking
supervision may soon be placed under the wing of the central bank and given
the task of supervising Finland's banking and insurance markets.
The latter are monitored by the Ministry of Social Affairs now, but it would
make more sense to combine regulation of the two sectors under one roof to
allow a more comprehensive monitoring of the markets.

(6): New structure could be key to expansion - Profile: Unitas

<TEXT>
UNION Bank of Finland's decision to reorganise its banking operations and
equity holdings under a new parent banking group is seen as a wise move,
possibly paving the way for a bold expansion in the insurance sector soon.
Finnish banks may only own up to 10 per cent of an insurance company,
although a new law allowing banks to wholly-own insurers is expected to come
into force in January 1993. In the meantime, there is nothing to stop a
holding company from owning 100 per cent of a bank or insurance company,
thus by-passing the 10 per cent restriction.
The new UBF structure consists of a parent banking group, called Unitas,
with subsidiaries for the commercial banking operations and strategic
holdings. If Unitas changes its status to that of a holding company, as is
widely expected, then it would be able to acquire an insurance group and
establish a more broadly-based financial services group without having to
wait for the ownership law to be changed.
Mr Ahti Hirvonen, chairman of the Unitas board of management, says the
bank's reorganisation was influenced by developments in Europe, where 'the
barriers between banking and insurance have been coming down.'
He says: 'Only a minor part of insurance is interesting to the bank, namely
life insurance,' adding that the group could expand in this area either by
close co-operation with an insurance group, or by owning an insurer.
Mr Hirvonen believes that the new structure has other advantages, providing
a clearer picture of how the different business areas perform under separate
management. 'It allows clear management and a clear picture of profits . . .
traditionally in Finland, banks have held substantial stakes in industrial
companies and we feel it is better to separate responsibility between the
commercial banking side and the long-term strategic holdings,' he says.
As prices slumped in the Finnish stock market, Unitas had to write down the
value of its equity holdings last year: it made a loss of FM70m on the sale
of current asset equity holdings while profit on the sale of investment
assets was FM33.5m compared with FM101.5m the previous year.
On the banking side, too, Unitas is facing difficult times. Last year, the
Unitas group made a loss of FM128m before extraordinary items,
appropriations and taxes, compared with a profit of FM 480m in 1990.
Like other Finnish banks, Unitas blames its poor performance on the
recession and the low interest margins following the deregulation of
Finland's financial markets. Small- and medium-sized businesses in
particular have been badly hit by the recession and many are no longer
assured of a market in the Soviet Union following its disintegration.
'Soviet trade was very important for us as Finland exchanged consumer goods
for Soviet oil. Finnish textile and clothing companies were particularly
badly affected by the fall in Soviet demand for goods,' says Mr Hirvonen.
Meanwhile, the recession has taken its toll on companies in the property,
construction and consumer goods sectors.
Group credit write-offs jumped 44 per cent in 1991 to FM1.092bn. Net
interest income has fallen by FM252m to FM2.321bn because of low interest
margins and the growth in non-performing loans, which amounted to FM5.718bn
at the end of 1991.
One of the most frequent complaints among Finnish bankers is the fact that
the bulk of their longer-term credits (particularly mortgages) are tied to
the Finnish base rate while their funding costs are dictated by the more
volatile money market rates. Money market rates rose sharply in the first
part and autumn of 1991 and are much higher than the base rate.
Many bankers want the base rate's use as a measure for setting rates on
loans to be phased out. However, they see little chance of this happening
since the Parliamentary Supervisory Board of the Bank of Finland, which
makes decisions on interest rate policy, consists of politicians who are
reluctant to force up mortgage rates and upset the voters. As the majority
of new credits tend to be granted at market interest rates, the proportion
of loans tied to the base rate is gradually decreasing. For Unitas, 57 per
cent of the loan portfolio was still tied to the base rate at the end of
1991.
'We are not satisfied with the 1991 results,' says Mr Hirvonen, who retires
next year and who will be replaced by Mr Vesa Vainio, currently president
and managing director at the Finnish pulp and paper group Kymmene in which
Unitas is a leading shareholder. Mr Hirvonen thinks bankers will have little
cause to celebrate this year as loan write-offs will remain high and
non-performing loans will continue to increase. '1992 will be difficult, but
maybe towards the end of 1992 we can expect some upturn in the business
cycle,' he says, attempting a smile.

THE finishing touches are being put to a new bank which is set to become the
largest in the Nordic region when it opens its doors for business at the
beginning of next year.
To be called provisionally Sparbanken Sverige AB, but known as Swedbank
abroad, it will unify the country's larger and medium-sized savings banks in
one organisation. The conglomerate will have assets totalling SKr540bn, at
least 3m customers and will employ 14,000 staff in 785 offices. The new
enterprise will account for as much as 90 per cent of Sweden's savings bank
business.
It will become a joint stock company and Mr Goran Collert, who will be head
of the bank and is now president and chief executive at Swedbank, hopes that
it will be listed on the Stockholm bourse, perhaps by the end of next year
at the earliest.
'We are going to be a strong player as a full service bank in Sweden', says
Mr Robert Stenram, head of the London branch of Swedbank and executive
vice-president. He points out that Swedbank already accounts for 34 per cent
of the mutual funds business in Sweden, 30 per cent of long-term mortgage
financing, 20 per cent of foreign exchange trading and half the Swedish
market in domestic credit cards.
The emerging giant should at least bring some semblance of order to the
confused and fragmented Swedish savings bank scene by bringing together all
10 regional savings banks who account for three quarters of Sweden's savings
bank activities, Sparbankerna's bank and the ailing Forsta Sparbank.
However, about 90 other small local savings banks will continue to operate
outside the new body although they will have working agreements with it.
The catalyst for change in Sweden's savings banks has mainly come from the
huge rise in credit losses due to bad real estate and stock loans suffered
by a growing number of the banks.
This was highlighted most dramatically last October when Sweden's new
centre-right coalition government was forced to bail out the Stockholm-based
Forsta Sparbanken by giving it an unconditional guarantee for a SKr3.8bn
loan from Sparbanken's gruppen AB, the federation of regional savings banks.
Forsta Sparbank had revealed it made a pre-tax loss of SKr3.1bn for its
first eight months of the year and the bank estimated its full-year loss
would be about SKr4bn. Its loan losses had climbed to an astronomical
SKr4.5bn, 10 per cent of its outstanding loans, while the bank said it had
doubled its loan portfolio between 1987 and 1990 to nearly SKr45bn
outstanding.
Last autumn's disaster at Forsta Sparbanken has helped to create an
understandable sense of crisis and forced Sweden's savings banks to
recognise that if they want to survive and prosper they need to accept
closer integration to deal with the problems of financial viability,
shortage of capital and a possible lack of confidence in them by their
customers.
In fact, Sparbankerna's bank boosted profits by 21 per cent last year to
SKr1.03bn despite credit losses of SKr1.11bn.
The coming merger is certainly an obvious way of ensuring a better
utilisation of resources for all the savings banks involved. It has been
estimated there could be savings of up to SKr2bn a year as a result of
rationalising the savings bank sector. Economies of scale - it is being
argued - could also help to improve the range and quality of services on
offer and strengthen the bank's international activities.
One point, however, that the new bank's customers will be glad to hear is
that it promises to be prudent and concentrate on basic services. The days
of pan-Nordic dreams are over even for an organisation that looks like
becoming a serious competitor for Sweden's existing commercial banks.

(3): Trying times - Profile: S-E Banken

<TEXT>
MR Bo Ramfors has the look of a man who would like to put the recent past
well behind him and push on fast. The two years that he has spent at the
helm of Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken, Sweden's largest commercial bank,
have been particularly trying.
He has been thwarted in his plan to create a giant Swedish banking and
insurance group by merging with Skandia, the Swedish insurance group. At the
same time, he has witnessed a dramatic increase in the bank's credit losses
as the Swedish economy has plunged into recession.
To cap it all, S-E Banken had its long-term debt rating lowered from AA to
AA- by Standard &amp; Poor's in February 1992, reflecting concern over the
bank's deteriorating asset quality.
The Skandia affair, played out over several months, has been a serious
setback for the bank and has cost it dearly. Back in October 1990, S-E
Banken paid SKr4.7bn for an option on 28.2 per cent of the shares in
Skandia, acquired from three companies: Investor and Providentia (the
Wallenberg family investment companies which were in need of funds at the
time) and Marieberg, the publishing group.
S-E Banken, which is linked with the Wallenbergs, wanted to form a large
banking and insurance group. Mr Ramfors, S-E Banken group chief executive,
says: 'If S-E Banken and Skandia had merged, together we would have had
about 25 per cent of the Swedish savings market' including bank accounts,
collective funds and life insurance, and managing assets of SKr500bn-600bn.
His aim was to sell life and non-life insurance products to a wider customer
base through the bank's large branch network.
Skandia - which has already established a series of cross-holdings and
co-operation agreements with insurance companies in the Nordic region as
part of its plan to establish a pan-Nordic insurance group - said it could
see no overall benefits for its shareholders in linking up with S-E Banken.
Although Skandia admits there are advantages to selling life insurance
products through a bank network, it had reservations about what would happen
to its non-life insurance business as a result of the merger. 'We don't have
proof that selling non-life (insurance) through a bank is a success', says
Mr Johan Bergenstjerna, head of Skandia's corporate office.
So S-E Banken was snubbed in its wooing of Skandia, and was forced to sell
most of its share option - at a loss of SKr415m - to Hafnia, the Danish
insurance company, and Uni Storebrand, the Norwegian insurer, keeping only
4.9 per cent itself.
Mr Ramfors says now that despite the cost of SKr415m he has 'no regrets'
about the saga.
Mr Gerard de Geer, who was chairman of Enskilda Securities in Sweden and
Banque Scandinave in Geneva, and who was involved in the Skandia deal as a
member of the bank's executive committee, decided to leave S-E Banken. Part
of the reason, bank sources indicate, was that he was disappointed because
the bank did not push harder to merge with Skandia. He was also understood
to be disappointed that plans to fully merge Enskilda and Banque Scandinave
were eventually abandoned for tax and legal reasons. S-E Banken is now
building up its own insurance operations.
While the problems over Skandia are unique to S-E Banken, the other blow it
has suffered - its huge credit losses - are familiar to many other Swedish
banks, and result from the combination of a deregulated banking environment,
the economic downturn, and in some cases, rather lax credit controls.
For years, Sweden's banks suffered restrictions on their lending, pricing,
foreign exchange and foreign payments. Then, during the 1980s, Sweden's
financial markets were deregulated and the commercial banks enjoyed a surge
in profits. 'Suddenly, overnight, we could lend as much money as we wanted,'
says Mr Ramfors.
The economy boomed and property and stock prices surged, helped by easy
credit. However, now that property prices have collapsed, many of the
Swedish banks are regretting their over-exposure to the real estate sector.
'With the benefit of hindsight, the banks should have been more careful,
they should have realised they were too exposed to property,' says one
banking analyst.
S-E Banken had to make loan-loss provisions of SKr4.76bn in 1991, compared
with SKr1.95bn in 1990. These included a SKr352m loan-loss provision for
finance company Gamlestaden, and combined loan-loss provisions of SKr1.1bn
for Avena and Reinhold, two troubled real estate groups. These three
companies account for about 30 per cent of S-E Banken's loan-loss
provisions. Small and medium-sized companies account for about 60 per cent.
As a result of these credit losses, S-E Banken's operating profit fell by 30
per cent to SKr2.33bn last year, from SKr3.31bn in 1990. Yet the bank's
profit before provisions actually increased by 30 per cent from SKr5.46bn to
SKr7.09bn in 1991, helped by cost-cutting measures and increasing net
interest margins.
Operating profit should continue to rise this year but Mr Ramfors expects
further fall-out from the property sector. In other words, the outlook for
1992 remains gloomy.

(2): Deep-rooted troubles - Sweden: Nordbanken is beset with bad debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR

<TEXT>
NORDBANKEN, Sweden's loss-making state-controlled bank, has been more badly
hit over the past year by credit losses than any of its main competitors and
it is unlikely it will make a full recovery until 1994 at the earliest. 'We
have had a turbulent 12 months, admits Mr Jacob Palmstierna, vice-chairman.
In 1990 the bank's bad debts soared to about SKr10bn and Nordbanken believes
they will 'continue abnormally high' in 1992 and that 1993 will also be a
difficult year.
Sweden's centre-right government would like to privatise the state's 70.6
per cent stake in Nordbanken but the bank's leadership will need to resolve
its troubles before such a move seems possible.
Nordbanken's overall financial target is to maintain over one business cycle
'a return on adjusted shareholders' equity of 17 per cent after standard
tax' and ensure a capital adequacy of 'well over 8 per cent'.
The current leadership was installed at Nordbanken in January 1991 when the
then Social Democratic minority government appointed the deputy chief
executive at Skandia insurance company, Mr Hans Dalborg, as chief executive
with Mr Bjorn Wahlstrom, head of Svensk Stal AB, the state-owned steel
company, as its chairman.
The dramatic changes at the top of Nordbanken followed the revelation that
it expected to suffer SKr3bn of credit losses in 1990. In fact, the losses
turned out to be much higher at SKr4.2bn and ensured a sharp fall in the
bank's profits for that year to a mere SKr1m - down from SKr3.2bn in 1989.
The Dalborg-Wahlstrom regime appeared to make an impressive start in the
early part of 1991. A cost-saving programme was launched and jobs were cut
through a rationalisation of the bank's structure. An intensive care unit
was created to recover outstanding loans. And in a move decided to show just
how seriously the bank was taking its difficulties, it was decided not to
pay a dividend.
As a result, during the first four months, Nordbanken saw its operating
profits climb by 59 per cent to SKr471m. But this proved to be a false dawn.
Indeed, the bank was already warning at that stage about the remorseless
rise in its credit losses which it said could reach SKr3.6bn for the whole
of 1991.
The magnitude of the troubles was highlighted last August with a crisis at
Nobel Industries, the chemicals and defence group. Nordbanken intervened to
save Nobel and agreed to inject SKr2bn of equity - and 13 other banks also
chipped in with SKr2.7bn in preference capital. But last month Nobel's board
said it was seeking repayments of SKr1.92bn - made to help the bank
consortium in its rescure operation - and Nobel's owner claimed SKr3.8bn in
damages from the banks over the affair.
Last autumn, the Nobel crisis took its toll at Nordbanken. At the end of
September it reported a SKr4.6bn deficit in its first eight-month financial
results, with credit losses soaring to SKr8bn. It became the first Swedish
commercial bank to go into deficit and it predicted that credit losses for
the year as a whole would amount to SKr9.5bn. This was the largest in the
country's banking history and amounted to 3.5 per cent of total lending
volume. The bank also said it had SKr15bn worth of non-performing loans on
its books for credits granted between 1988 and 1990 to finance, property and
investment companies.
The Swedish government agreed last October to help out the bank by
subscribing and guaranteeing SKr5.2bn in a new share issue at SKr20 per
share, enabling it to meet the 8 per cent capital adequacy requirement made
by the Bank of International Settlements for the end of this year.
The troubles at Nordbanken have proved to be much more deep-rooted than at
first realised; a painful legacy from the period of frenetic competition for
customers that followed Sweden's deregulation in the second half of the
1980s.
The bank itself was only formed in June 1990 as a merger between
state-controlled PKbanken and its smaller provincial competitor Nordbanken.
This followed a period of aggressive expansion by PKbanken as it tried to
boost its profitability by widening its business beyond its traditional base
of small savers and lending to local government authorities to cover real
estate and high finance. PKbanken harboured dreams of competing alongside SE
Banken and Svenska Handelsbanken for business volumes, but its credit growth
proved to be excessive.
'With hindsight you can say the bank grew too rapidly', says Mr Palmstierna.
He also believes that while PKbanken's SKr6bn purchase of Nordbanken was
'structurally and strategically correct, the price was exorbitant'.
Despite its current travails, Nordbanken believes it can reach its financial
targets by 1994. In its prospectus for last year's new share offer it
emphasised a number of its underlying strengths. The bank argued that it was
now following a restrictive credit policy; that its earnings capacity was
good and stable before credit losses; and that its cost-cutting measures had
improved efficiency.
Nordbanken does have a unique distribution network with not only 230 branch
offices in Sweden but also the use of 2,000 post offices in co-operation
with Swedish Post. 'As many as 4m Swedes are our customers', says Mr
Palmstierna.
The bank also believes that the fact that the state is majority owner will
affect favourably the creditworthiness of the bank.
But there are also a number of imponderables that cast a shadow over
Nordbanken. Not least is the duration of Sweden's current recession and the
impact this is having on the bank's customers. Despite the general sense of
crisis in Swedish banking at the moment, it is also possible that the bank
may lose its present dominant position in the country's large public sector
as its rivals compete for business in a more bracing financial climate.
What Nordbanken really needs is three years of quiet consolidation and back
to basics like so many other banks in the Nordic region. But the hang-over
period could well last longer at Nordbanken than perhaps with the others.
'The balloon that was blown up during the carnival years of the 1980s has
burst', declared Mr Dalborg, the bank's chairman, last autumn when
announcing the bank's unexpectedly large deficit for the first eight months
of 1991. It looks like taking plenty more blood, sweat and tears to restore
its credibility. However at least we will know when Nordbanken has returned
to good health: that will be the moment when the Swedish state decides to
privatise it.

<TEXT>
AFTER the champagne days of the 1980s, the Nordic region's financial system
is going through a prolonged hangover, which shows no signs at all of coming
to an end.
Leading financial institutions in Norway, Finland and Sweden are still being
hit hard by soaring bad debts, caused in many cases by the reckless
provision of unsecured credit for the speculative activities of finance and
property companies.
Over the past few weeks, one bank after another has reported the grim
consequences in the form of falling profits and huge credit losses. Few have
emerged unscathed.
Norway's leading banks have been suffering from disastrous deficits for the
past three years and it has needed direct government intervention to prevent
a collapse of the country's banking system. In Sweden, Forsta Sparbanken,
the Stockholm-based savings bank, and the state-controlled Nordbanken, have
both required government guarantees for loans to prop them up.
In Finland, the savings bank federation, Skopbanken, was only saved from
collapse last autumn by being taken over temporarily by the country's
central bank. Only Denmark has been spared from the prevailing sense of
crisis.
What is adding to the anxiety across much of Scandinavia is the sobering
realisation that there is not going to be any rapid and immediate recovery
from current difficulties. Signs of improvement in the financial position of
the banks and other financial institutions are not expected during the
course of this year.
Even 1993 is already looking difficult. Some observers are starting to
wonder just how sizeable the credit losses will eventually be, and what
impact they will have on the capital base of the leading banks. The disaster
in Norway in 1991 brought total accumulated losses for the financial
institutions of NKr19.8bn. In a number of cases the losses were higher than
the equity capital.
Bankers in Stockholm say that Sweden is not going to experience what Norway
is going through but they may yet be proven over-optimistic.
The whole of the Nordic region is paying a bitter price for the liberating
impact of financial deregulation that first began in the mid 1980s. In the
new competitive climate created by the lifting of controls and rules, banks
and finance companies rushed in to try and satisfy demand for loans, and
competed against each other for corporate and personal customers, with
little regard for proof of credit soundness.
'Handling credit is like handling explosives', explains Mr Jacob
Palmstierna, vice-chairman of Sweden's Nordbanken. 'If you don't know how to
handle it, in time it explodes'.
The supervisory authorities, as well as the Nordic governments and central
banks, underestimated the turmoil that deregulation would bring to the
financial system. 'We saw the gains without seeing the pain which could be
incurred in the pursuit of efficiency,' admits Mr Bengt Dennis, the governor
of Sweden's central bank.
The impact of the credit losses is coming in three waves, Mr Palmstierna
points out. First, it is hitting the real estate and finance companies.
Next, bad debts are being incurred by industrial enterprises, particularly
among small and medium-sized firms. Finally, private individuals will start
to default. So far, this dismal process has only reached the first phase.
The regulatory authorities, governments and central banks are looking at how
to respond.
It will not be easy for the banks and other financial institutions to go
back to basics, drop their pan-Nordic visions and consolidate their
activities, when the pace of external change shows no signs of easing.
Indeed, further deregulation is going to force the Nordic financial world to
become ever more competitive.
'The doors have been almost completely opened to international competition,
and yet the spirit of a tightly-controlled, closed economy still pervades
the economic and financial system', argues Mr Tuoman Sukselainen at the
Finnish Banker's Association.
The traditional commercial bank is being transformed into a multi-faceted
financial services institution. The market is demanding that banks must
provide every kind of financial service to corporate and household customers
alike. As a result, there will more freedom of choice in the Nordic
financial sector during the 1990s.
Moreover, as Mr Dennis told a banking conference in Kuala Lumpur last month,
the number of non-bank financial firms coming into the market, often banks
in all but name, is growing. 'The expanding menu of bank services is pushing
more and more of the banks' risk exposure off the balance sheet,' he warned.
The globalisation of financial markets is also going to intensify the
pressures on the banks and other financial institutions in the Nordic
region. Removing foreign exchange controls and other restrictions has made
the economies of the Nordic countries much more vulnerable to short-term
capital fluctuations. The Nordic currencies have been pegged to the European
Currency Unit and this has been backed by tough fiscal policies by the
governments of the region.
Devaluation and demand management are no longer accepted as instruments of
economic management. The Finnish markka was devalued last November, but this
move was regarded, even by supporters, as a final, one-off measure,
necessitated by uniquely difficult conditions. These resulted from the
collapse of Finnish trade with Russia, coinciding as it did with a trough in
the paper and pulp industry cycle.
A more telling sign of the new times in the region was the Swedish central
bank's draconian decision to raise lending rates to the banks by 6 per
centage points shortly after the markka devaluation. This helped to restore
overseas confidence and stem a dangerous outflow of capital from Sweden, but
it also underlined the fragility of the more open financial system within
which the Nordic countries must operate. 'We live in a tightly integrated
global financial village', explains Mr Dennis.
Nordic financial institutions have little time to adapt to further external
pressures. On January 1, 1993, the European Community's single market comes
into effect and with it the free movement of capital as part of the
19-nation European Economic Area (EEA).
The extension to the Nordic area of the EC's second banking directive is
also designed to stimulate more competition. A single banking licence will
entitle any financial institution to operate in the EEA market based only on
the authorisation of its home country.
Supervision of the activities of financial institutions, including
day-to-day activities, as well as financial solvency, will take place where
it is incorporated and not where it operates. The principle of mutual
recognition will also be applied so the respective host countries'
authorities will recognise each other's authorisation and supervision.
The second development that will certainly make an impact on the Nordic
region by the end of this year is the implementation of the banking capital
adequacy requirements of the Basle-based International Banking Settlement.
Only in Norway does there seem likely to be any difficulty in meeting this
stipulation.
But beyond those pressures lies the wider and murky issue of European
economic and monetary union.
All the Nordic countries (even divided Norway) are intent on joining the EC
by 1995 but so far the debate about monetary integration has hardly gone
further than the preliminary stage.
However, enough has happened over the past year in the Nordic banking and
investment scene to suggest there will be no return either to the heady
atmosphere of the late 1980s or the semi-isolation that lasted for nearly
half a century. Instead, there is likely to be a confusing mixture of
consolidation and competition.
The Nordic countries used to be renowned for their belief in moderation,
consensus and stability but recent banking problems suggest they have lost
their sense of balance.
What is needed more than ever is the revival of older virtues. They provide
the best guide for the Nordic countries as they seek to adapt to the
arbitrariness of the open global financial system.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Monday Interview: Enemy of restrictive practices - Sir
Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, talks to Geoffrey Owen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEOFFREY OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Given the choice, I prefer to take a complaint to Brussels, where the
response is swift and vigorous, than to the Office of Fair Trading.'
This comment from a London-based competition lawyer highlights an anomaly.
The present Conservative government in Britain, which believes in
competition, has been curiously passive in dealing with what is probably the
most widespread anti-competitive practice - price-fixing. No action has been
taken on the 1989 white paper which proposed stronger powers for the
director-general of fair trading. Last week's Tory manifesto promises new
legislation on the subject; it cannot come soon enough for the competition
authorities.
'We have been much frustrated by the inadequacy of our investigatory
powers,' says Sir Gordon Borrie, who hands over as director-general to Sir
Bryan Carsberg in June. 'I also believe the deterrent powers are inadequate
because the sanctions are both remote and modest when they apply.'
A Court of Appeal judgment last year made matters even worse. It ruled that
a company was not responsible for the price-fixing activities of a senior
employee when it had issued a prohibition to its staff and had adequate
monitoring arrangements in place. Sir Gordon is urging victims of cartels,
when they are uncovered, to sue for the losses they have suffered. 'Some
well-publicised successes would be a useful deterrent,' he says. But his
influence is limited.
Restrictive practices are not the only area where he would like to see
competition policy tightened. On mergers, he points out, the present system
is benign. 'The Monopolies and Mergers Commission has to have very strong
evidence that a merger will operate in an anti-competitive way before coming
to an adverse finding.'
Sir Gordon suggests a small but important shift in the burden of proof, so
that the commission would block potentially anti-competitive mergers unless
the parties could demonstrate that there were offsetting gains, such as
greater efficiency or lower costs.
Those who think the commission is too soft on mergers will applaud Sir
Gordon's plan. At present clearance is normally given to border-line cases -
and even some which seem not so border-line, like the merger in the roadside
catering business between Happy Eater and Little Chef, cleared in 1987 as
part of a deal between Trusthouse Forte and Hanson. (Sir Gordon found this
verdict 'a little surprising'.)
The opposite criticism is that merger policy creates costly uncertainty for
businessmen while doing very little to promote competition. Sir Gordon
strongly disagrees. If merger control did not exist, 'you could only deal
with monopolistic situations after they had been created'.
He points to gas and telecommunications. Because they were privatised as
monopolies, they have to be controlled by price regulation, which is a 'poor
substitute' for competition. The Kingfisher/Dixons merger proposal, referred
to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and turned down in 1990,
illustrates his point. If there had been no merger control and the deal had
gone through, 'you would have got a substantial monopoly situation in DIY
retailing, especially in out-of-town centres; where would be the protection
for customers from monopolistic pricing?'
As for complaints about unpredictability, Sir Gordon thinks the commission
has made good progress towards greater consistency; it seeks to explain its
decisions by reference to principles established in earlier reports.
He agrees that there could be room for more specific use of precedents and
this has begun to happen. But 'certainty can be bought at too high a price'.
Rigid rules about, for example, maximum permissible market shares could lead
to perverse judgments. At the reference stage, too, he thinks the secretary
of state needs to have some discretion to respond to developments - like the
Kuwait Investment Office's shareholding in British Petroleum - for which
there are no precedents.
Why not limit the discretion to cases where public interest considerations
other than competition are at stake? Sir Gordon agrees it would be logical,
in mergers where competition is the only issue, to leave the reference
decision to the director-general. (He already has jurisdiction over monopoly
references, where whole industries are referred to the MMC.)
In making his recommendation on merger references, the director-general
takes advice from officials in the relevant government departments. For the
DTI then to second-guess him seems pointless. 'Several secretaries of state
have suggested that they don't really want that role.'
Sir Gordon's most serious worries about political interference in merger
control centre not on the British system, but on the European Community -
which is why he has suggested the creation of an independent European body
like the MMC. His concern is that, 'under the present sysdifficult to keep
political considerations out of cases that ought to be determined on
competition grounds'.
He was relieved that the commission came to what he regarded as the right
decision in the recent commuter aircraft case. He places much reliance on
the fact that the commissioner in charge of the policy, 'whose word normally
goes', is Sir Leon Brittan, a strong advocate of competition.
The UK's competition rules, of course, are far from perfect. The ideal
sequence of reform, in his view, would be a radical improvement in the laws
relating to restrictive practices along the lines of Article 85 of the
Treaty of Rome, with a further addition to alter last year's Court of Appeal
ruling.
Then, he suggests, 'although this has not been clearly worked out by myself
or anyone else, we would need to look at the law relating to monopolies and
competition, and perhaps see whether Article 86 would be a suitable model'.
He would like to retain the power to initiate inquiries by the MMC into
whole industries, which is not available under EC legislation.
Meanwhile the uncertainties of the present law will continue, including the
possibility that a new government might use the wide-ranging Section 84 of
the Fair Trading Act to refer mergers that have nothing to do with
competition - 'mergers that might be inimical to regional growth in Scotland
or something of that sort'. That, says Sir Gordon, is for the politicians to
decide.
As for the machinery of competition policy, he is not impressed with the
argument, endorsed recently by the Commons Trade and Industry Committee, for
combining the MMC and the competition side of the OFT in one organisation.
He accepts that the case for such a combination is somewhat stronger on
mergers alone; the Cartel Office in Germany handles both the preliminary
inquiries into mergers and the full investigations, and there would be
advantages in the pooling of knowledge. But transferring the whole of the
OFT's competition work is quite another matter.
For one thing, the organisation of the MMC, with its reliance on part-time
members, is quite inappropriate for the large administrative and negotiating
load which falls to the OFT. Apart from the gains from combining competition
and consumer protection under one roof, he thinks it is useful to have
someone at the head of the OFT who can play a more partisan role in
promoting competition than would be suitable for the head of the Restrictive
Practices Court or the Monopolies Commission.
As for relations with the new regulatory agencies, 'in retrospect one could
have drawn the lines in somewhat different places'. In one privatised
industry, buses, he has sometimes wished that there had been an 'Ofbus', to
relieve the OFT of the burden of post-privatisation regulatory activity.
He thinks, but perhaps not before the end of the century, price competition
in gas and telecommunications may have reached the point where the need for
specialised regulation could disappear. At the same time there could be a
case for bringing together whatever regulatory agencies were still needed on
a long-term basis.
But all this is a long way off. 'I am not keen on institutional changes,
especially if politicians see them as a substitute for something more
important,' he says.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Letter From Tokyo: The golden age of Japanese youth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
March, the season of plum-blossom in Tokyo, is also graduation time for
thousands of young Japanese and their parents.
The academic year ends with a flourish of ceremonies marking the five great
divides of Japanese education - from kindergarten to junior school, from
junior school to middle school, from middle school to high school, from high
school to university and finally from university to adult life.
Each is endowed with a symbolic importance matched in Britain only by the
cloak and mortar-board ritual of the university. My six-year-old daughter,
Sabina's, graduation from our neighbourhood kindergarten was no exception.
My wife and I knew this would be no ordinary day. Weeks in advance she was
told the other mothers would all wear formal clothes but that 'since you're
a foreigner, please wear something bright and cheerful'. A few days later
she was told: 'Tell your husband to wear a suit and tie. And we've chosen
him to make a speech.'
The great day came last Friday. We dressed in accordance with instructions
and made sure we were on time. Almost all the other parents wore shades of
navy blue and grey, with pearls and video-recorders very much in evidence.
The kindergarten has an unusual history. It was established earlier this
century by a philosophy teacher who read the Bible and other western works
and selected the passages he thought most appropriate for Japan. Applying
the same utilitarian eclecticism with which other Japanese scoured
scientific manuals and patent records, the founder created his own church.
The church and the kindergarten almost fell victim to the Japanese land boom
of the 1980s. Their landlord wanted to reclaim the site in the middle of
Tokyo, which the congregation has occupied for decades, and started legal
proceedings. With Solomon-like logic, the lawyers decided the landlord could
have the use of only half the land. Moreover, the landlord was instructed to
pay a substantial sum to the tenants in return for their giving up rights to
the other half of the plot. With the proceeds, the congregation built a new
kindergarten and a chapel.
The graduation took place in the chapel. Despite being bent double by her
advanced age, the headmistress presided over the ceremony with great spirit.
Almost as soon as she began speaking of the trials and tribulations the
six-year-olds would face in life, mothers started sobbing. They were quickly
joined by the teachers. Contrary to western opinion, Japanese are very
emotional. They are simply brought up to avoid being emotional in the wrong
places - such as the office or factory floor.
The headmistress believes the problems of modern Japan, especially political
corruption, are all to do with people not being properly educated as
children. 'All these politicians trying to escape blame for their own
wrong-doings. They have no sense of personal responsibility,' she says.
Her pet hate is the Japanese bow. Bowing breaks eye-contact between people.
It is also a symbol of inequality, since inferiors are required to bow lower
than their social superiors. The headmistress prefers the western-style
handshake: every morning she insists the children look her in the eye and
shake her hand.
However, she regards the graduation ceremony as so important that she makes
an exception. When the children received their certificates from her, they
were told to bow low out of respect to the kindergarten. After several
speeches, the event ended with a tear-jerker of a song called 'Thank you,
sayonara,' followed by photographs and a huge party.
I wondered why so much energy is lavished on a ceremony for such young
children, especially as it is repeated at the ages of 13, 16, 18 and 22.
Partly, it seems to reflect the respect given to teachers in Japan. In
traditional Japanese custom, a debt to a teacher is one which can never be
repaid.
Also, these ceremonies are a measure of the significance of the peer-group.
In adult life, people tend to be promoted by age. They regard peers as
equals and look up to elders. When asked their age, children will frequently
reply by giving their school-year. Executives often describe their seniority
by reference to when they entered the company. While such principles might
seem overly conservative to westerners, many Japanese believe they
contribute greatly to social order.
Watching my daughter leave the kindergarten for the last time, I considered
how different the experience had been from the stereotype of Japanese
education. A common western view is that Japanese schooling is an
examination hell in which children are forced to rote-learn and spend their
evenings at cram school. They achieve high grades in international
comparative tests, but at the price of their childhoods.
There is truth in this view - but it applies mostly to teenagers. Japanese
kindergarten is a golden age in which children receive no formal instruction
in Japanese language or arithmetic and are encouraged to play and run about.
Japanese parents mostly like it that way, aware of the pressures which lie
only just beyond the kindergarten gates. Little wonder they cry on
graduation day.

THE DOLLAR and sterling will again be closely watched in the currency
markets this week - although for different reasons.
The dollar surprisingly breached the DM1.68 barrier on Friday, after dealers
had predicted a consolidative period for a couple of weeks would see it
locked in a DM1.6350-DM1.6720 range.
Renewed dollar optimism could see it rise again this week, if the figures
for durable goods orders on Tuesday, GDP on Thursday, and personal income
and consumption on Friday are encouraging.
Although it has been largely priced in by the market, the dollar could draw
longer-term support from a likely cut in the Bank of Japan's discount rate,
expected imminently.
Dealers will be watching for sterling's reaction to yesterday's opinion
polls, four out of five of which showed the opposition Labour party to be
leading the conservatives ahead of the general election on April 9.
So far, sterling has held steady, with very little activity at all. Some
buying interest whenever it nears its effective floor against the peseta has
been enough to underpin it without Bank of England intervention.
Dealers say that this might be explained by the belief that, as both the
Conservatives and Labour are committed to taking sterling into the narrow
band of the ERM at a DM2.95 central rate, sterling has less to fear from an
outright victory by either party than it does from a hung parliament and
prolonged political uncertainty.
They warn that if this scenario looks likely, and domestic investors decide
to sell sterling, foreign investors could follow suit. This could still see
the UK currency being pushed down towards its absolute ERM floor of
DM2.7780.

FT  23 MAR 92 / The Week Ahead: Results due
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FULL-YEAR figures tomorrow from P&amp;O, the shipping, construction and property
group, are expected to show a drop in pre-tax profits to around Pounds
200m-Pounds 210m from Pounds 261.3m in 1990. This will be the second year of
sharply falling profits, though the forecast assumes a more stable second
half after interim figures showed a plunge to Pounds 73.1m (Pounds 132.1m).
P&amp;O's balance sheet was bolstered by a Pounds 604m rights issue announced
with the interims, when a maintained final dividend was promised.
On Wednesday Reckitt &amp; Colman, the consumer products group, should report a
rise in annual pre-tax profits to around Pounds 255m-Pounds 260m, up from
Pounds 235.2m in 1990. The main feature will be the performance of Boyle
Midway, the US business bought in 1990, in its first full year when some
significant savings have been made. Also, the benefits of the restructuring
of the European business over the last couple of years should be visible.
Interim profits were up 13 per cent to Pounds 127.6m.
Cookson, the chemicals group, also reports its full-year profits on
Wednesday. Analysts' expect pre-tax profits to well below last year's figure
of Pounds 97.5m. Estimates at the top end are about about Pounds 45m, and
the market is likely to be disappointed with anything below Pounds 40m.
The main concern will be the dividend which was cut last year to 6p for the
year. There is nervousness it could be cut again which analysts would take
as a signal the new management team has lost confidence in its policies.
They will also be looking for any sign of an upturn, particularly in the US.
Wellcome, the healthcare company, which reports its preliminary results on
Thursday, gave a profits forecast of not less than Pounds 235m (Pounds
181.2m) when the Wellcome Trust, the largest shareholder, said it would be
selling a substantial part of its 73.6 per cent stake.
Underlying sales growth should be about 20 per cent, with Zovirax, the
herpes treatment, and Retrovir, the Aids drug, performing well. Analysts
will also be looking at the performance of new products such as Exosurf, a
respiratory drug, and Wellbutrin, an anti-depressant.
Lasmo, the independent oil exploration and production company, will report
its results on Wednesday when analysts believe it will show a drop in net
income of some Pounds 10m to Pounds 71m as a result of low oil prices. But
the company is also planning to change its accounting practices.
Burmah Castrol, the refining and lubricants company, reports on Thursday and
although more insulated from the low oil price than exploration companies,
is expected to show a fall in net income to Pounds 72m from Pounds 97m the
previous year.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Economics: Major faces trade figures hurdle in election
run-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POOR economic data during an election campaign is never good news for the
incumbent party, but trade figures are especially unwelcome.
They have contributed towards upsets on many occasions, the February 1974
election campaign to name but one. A current account deficit of Pounds 312m
for January was announced just two days before the actual election. Mr
Edward Heath, the sitting prime minister lost.
So the Conservative party will be waiting in some trepidation for today's
trade figures even if they do come almost three weeks before polling day.
Once they are out and absorbed, John Major can breathe a sigh of relief, for
there will be no more significant UK economic data announced before the
election.
Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of City forecasts in brackets
from MMS International, a financial information company, include:
Today: UK, February visible trade balance (Pounds 900m deficit), February
current account (Pounds 450m deficit); Japan, February money supply (up 2.2
per cent on year); Sweden, fourth quarter GDP; Canada, January retail sales
(up 0.9 per cent).
Tomorrow: US, presidential primary in Connecticut, auto sales for March
11-20 (6.2m); France, February trade balance (Fr0.5bn surplus).
Wednesday: UK, Engineering Employers Federation release state of business
report and forecasts for the second quarter, February building society net
new commitments (Pounds 2.6bn); US, February durable orders (up 1.8 per
cent), February durable shipments, February existing home sales; Canada,
January international securities transactions.
Thursday: UK, NOP opinion poll - Newsnight/Independent; US, fourth quarter
final GDP (up 0.8 per cent), fourth quarter final GDP deflator (up 1.7 per
cent), fourth quarter after tax corporate profits, February export and
import price indices, M1 (Dollars 2bn), M2 (flat), M3 (Dollars 2bn) for
week-ending March 16, initial claims for week ended March 14 (435,000),
February new motor vehicle registrations; Japan, January personal income,
January personal consumption expenditure, February retail sales (up 2.7 per
cent on the year); Australia, February motor vehicle registrations (down 5
per cent), fourth quarter average weekly earnings, January manufacturing
price index.
Friday: US, February personal income (up 0.7 per cent), February personal
consumption expenditure (up 0.8 per cent), February bank credit, February
commercial and industrial loans; UK, March CBI industrial trends survey;
Japan, March Tokyo consumer prices index (up 2 per cent on year) excluding
perishables (up 2.4 per cent on year), February national CPI (up 1.9 per
cent on year), excluding perishables (up 2.2 per cent), preliminary figures
for February industrial production (down 0.7 per cent); Canada, February
industrial product price index (up 0.1 per cent).
During the week: Germany, February import prices (up 0.3 per cent on month,
down 1.4 per cent on year), February final cost of living (up 4.3 per cent
on year), March preliminary cost of living (up 0.3 per cent on the month, up
4.7 per cent on the year), February M3 from fourth quarter base (up 7.6 per
cent); Italy, March consumer prices index for the major cities (up 0.4 per
cent on month, up 5.5 per cent on year), February trade balance; Japan,
February trade balance and current account on IMF basis; France, February
unemployment rate (9.9 per cent).

FT  23 MAR 92 / Danish Bonds: Political factors tighten investors' nerves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DANISH economic indicators are pointing the right way for bond investors.
Low inflation, moderate business growth and a strong external account
should, all other things being equal, point to falling yields.
As the Danish economy is currently more stable than the German economy,
measured by inflation, there is a potential advantage in Danish bonds for
investors who believe that yields on German bunds are likely to rise.
But over the past few days the spread between yields on bunds and Danish
government bonds has widened from around 50-60 basis points to 70-75 basis
points. The main reason is a degree of nervousness in the market over Danish
political developments, said Mr Birger Durhuus, analyst at Danse Bors, the
broking arm of Den Danske Bank.
Three events, which formally are unconnected but interact with each other as
far as impact on the market is concerned, are tightening nerves in the
dealing rooms.
The opposition Social Democratic Party's leader, Mr Svend Auken, is being
challenged for the leadership by his deputy, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen. If
Nyrup wins, the party will have a better chance of winning the support of
the small centre parties in the eight-party Folketing and thus of an
eventual return to power.
The referendum on the Maastricht treaty takes place on June 2. Recent
opinion polls have shown majorities against approving the treaty. A 'No'
vote would have serious consequences for Denmark's future position in
Europe.
In September, the report of a commission of inquiry into a political scandal
concerning Tamil refugees will be published. It may conclude that Mr Poul
Schluter, the prime minister since 1982, misled parliament, in which case he
could resign. This might result in a change of government, either with or
without a general election first.
Politics aside, Danish economic performance is satisfactory from a bond
investor's point of view. Denmark is one of only two or three countries
which currently meet all the so-called convergence criteria required of
potential members of the EMU, including low inflation, stable exchange
rates, interest rates in line with those of leading countries, and a
manageable budget deficit.
The budget deficit, however, is big enough to make the market in government
bonds interesting. State net borrowing increased by DKr27bn in 1991, and the
figure will not be much different in 1992.

FT  23 MAR 92 / US Money and Credit: Treasuries suffer from the jitters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Treasury bond market is most definitely suffering from a case of the
jitters, and there are indications the bearish sentiment will continue this
week.
Last Friday saw a sharp fall in the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury
bond, with the  7/8 of a point drop - to 99 17/32 - sending the yield on the
paper up above the 8 per cent mark again, to 8.04 per cent. The price on
Friday was still  5/16 higher on the week, but the emerging negative trend
seems likely to continue.
The nervousness stems from mounting fears among investors that the US
economic recovery will be stronger and faster than had been previously
anticipated. Good news for the US economy means bad news for the bond
market, and investor concerns about recovery and fiscal stimuli resulting in
more inflation are producing higher interest rates in the market.
It does not seem to matter to market psychology that top US officials are on
the record as brushing aside any serious concern about inflationary
pressure. Nor does it seem relevant to the knee-jerk bond market that few
economists or bankers actually expect much beyond a very gradual and fragile
US recovery.
Equally, the market is still worried about an election year tax cut that
could worsen the already horrific US budget deficit. But last Friday's
presidential veto of a Democratic tax package describes the situation
perfectly - a highly partisan battle of words between Mr Bush and the
Democrats that is resulting in a prolonged period of inaction rather than
fiscally dangerous decision-making.
While in Washington, an overly optimistic Mr Nicholas Brady, the Treasury
Secretary, suggested last week that the recovery is now here, many
economists in New York are less bullish.
Mr Philip Braverman, chief economist at DKB Securities, noted that the US
economy remains vulnerable to new recessionary setbacks, possibly stemming
from major real estate, bank and insurance company bankruptcies.
Mr Braverman also warned that the perception of an economic pick-up is due
to a combination of transitory factors, inflated by inappropriate seasonal
adjustments.
The market's response to such common sense caution is a great big 'So what]'
Something of a panic has hit a large number of the narrow-minded and
short-term denizens of the Treasury bond market.
A few indications of an improving retail sector started the ball rolling.
Never mind that one or two statistical indicators do not a roaring retail
recovery make. Then, on Friday morning, the Philadelphia Federal Reserve's
monthly regional survey also indicated an improving trend - helping to
trigger Friday's sell-off.
This week the bond traders will be glued to their Reuter monitors once
again, watching a stream of more data and once again confusing the forest
with the trees.
On Wednesday, for example, the latest numbers on durable goods orders could
show a 4 to 5 per cent increase. Secondary home sales figures for February
could meanwhile show a 7 or 8per cent rise.
If those two numbers are not enough to spook the market, then personal
income and spending figures on Friday should do the trick. These,
respectively, are expected to show improvements of 0.4 per cent and 0.7 per
cent.
In this environment, the market will also be keeping a weather eye on the
Treasury's expected auction of Dollars 14.75bn in two-year notes and Dollars
10.25bn in five-year notes. Ms Maria Ramirez, the bond analyst, said a
coupon of 5 7/8 or even 6 per cent may be required to attract investor
interest, which would suggest the highest level since last October.
The bottom line would seem to be that the US recovery may well be getting
under way, but not nearly so fast as the statistic watchers fear. Whether
such common sense matters to bond traders is quite another matter.

FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Gilts: Election fears add selling pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government gilt-edged securities market continued to perform weakly, as
investors took fright from opinion polls indicating a poor showing for the
Conservative party.
At the same time, a general shift in purchasing patterns for bonds away from
European issues and into Japanese and US instruments helped to push down
gilt prices.
But in thin trading there were indications of modest buying support for
gilts, relative to other European bonds, as the recent rise in yields made
the instruments appear cheap to some investors.
Over the week, prices for gilts fell by up to  1/2 point, following a drop
of 1 1/2 points the week before. There was a consequent moderate rise in
yields.
The selling pressure was triggered mainly by nervousness about the April 9
election. Many gilt practitioners fear that a government formed by the
opposition Labour party, or a hung parliament, would lead to a large drop in
bond prices.
Gilt prices were not helped by a general move by international investors to
switch money out of European bonds, with US Treasury issues being the main
beneficiary. Japanese bonds also experienced extra demand. Much of this
development followed jitters about the level of wage settlements and
inflationary pressures in Germany, which could mean no early reduction in
German interest rates by the Bundesbank.
A continuation of the German central bank's tight monetary policy would
prolong the period of high borrowing rates in other European countries,
including Britain and France. Such countries have to keep their short-term
rates tied to those in Germany due to the linkage of the European exchange
rate mechanism. The prospect of high rates in Britain and France until well
into the second half of 1992 effectively diminishes the appeal to investors
of government bonds issued by these nations' governments.
During the week, the short-dated UK Treasury 10 per cent gilt maturing in
1994 dropped by just under  1/4 point, closing on Friday at about 99 23/32 .
Its yield was pushed up from 10.04 to 10.12 per cent (expressed in
semi-annual terms).
Longer dated securities performed worse, resulting from investors moving
their attention away from these bonds to the shorter end of the yield curve.
This was in search for what, after the sharp rise in short-maturing gilt
yields the previous week, appeared like bargain bonds in the stretch of the
curve below the 10-year mark. The 9 per cent Treasury bond due in 2002 lost
a little over  1/2 point, closing at 64 7/16 for a yield of 9.83 per cent.
As a result of these changes 10-year gilt yields have gained about 50 basis
points (half a percentage point) in yield in the past month, underlining
their reduced attraction.
Over the same period, German 10-year bonds have also seen their yields
pushed up, but by only about 15 basis points, while French bonds of the
equivalent maturity have seen a yield gain of roughly 25 basis points.
This means that investors are demanding a yield premium of slightly more
than 200 basis points for 10-year gilts against the comparable German bonds.
Just three weeks ago, the yield difference between the two classes of bonds
was only 150 basis points, indicating that since then investors have become
a lot more wary about holding UK bonds.
The nervousness shown by many investors about gilts was in spite of economic
data last week indicating no let up in the 18-month UK recession.
In normal times, this would increase the attraction to investors of
fixed-interest securities. This is on the basis that the chances of large
rises in prices at either the wholesale or the retail level in Britain over
the next year or so are extremely weak.
However, the imminence of the election - plus the doubts about the next move
on interest rates by the Bundesbank - mean such calculations count for
little.
According to Mr Sanjay Joshi, a bond specialist at Daiwa Securities, the
Japanese finance house, the German central bank might be so vexed about the
dangers of spiralling inflation that its next move might be to push rates
up. As well as sending shock waves around European countries, which need to
pull rates down to revive their flagging economies, that could accelerate
the drift by investors out of the European bond markets and in particular
reduce gilt prices.

FT  23 MAR 92 / International Bonds: Treasurers tune in to medium-term note
programmes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE line between a corporate treasurer hitting a borrowing target or missing
it can be very fine indeed. Five basis points (0.05 of a percentage point)
may sound a small, almost insignificant fraction, but to an aggressive
corporate borrower it makes all the difference. One result of this
relentless pursuit of finer terms is the rapid growth of a medium-term note
market in Europe, in some places in direct competition to the public
Eurobond market.
Medium-term notes have traditionally existed between the short-term
commercial paper markets and bond markets. As with commercial paper, an MTN
programme acts as a shelf registration, providing a platform of
documentation for a borrower to issue debt instruments whenever needed. The
terms of each issue of notes (currency, maturity or perhaps an extra twist,
for instance linking the notes to an equity index) are picked to match what
investors want at any particular moment. In return for providing tailor-made
debt instruments, borrowers demand - and usually get - keener borrowing
terms.
Some treasurers are now learning that, rather than just dribbling out notes,
they can use the same documentation to launch large-scale, fully
underwritten issues that look and taste just like Eurobonds. That is
unlikely to spell the death of the public Eurobond market, though it is
already creating an alternative.
Using MTNs 'saves cost and time,' said Mr Peter Yngwe, treasurer of Swedish
Export Credit (SEK), a frequent user of the Eurobond markets. 'It could make
the difference between doing a transaction and not doing it, that is the
significant thing.'
SEK set up an MTN programme in the Euromarkets a year ago and issued Ecu100m
of one-year notes in a quasi-Eurobond offering. 'If it's a short maturity,
the costs can be a significant point,' said Mr Yngwe. He estimated using the
MTN route, rather than a Eurobond, saved between five and ten basis points.
The savings come from the fact that an MTN programme can be re-used
constantly, spreading the costs of setting it up, while a Eurobond offering
is a one-off event.
'You spread your cost across a larger number of bonds,' said Enterprise Oil,
which created an MTN programme in the US a year ago (the Euro-MTN market is
not yet liquid for maturities of more than five years, Enterprise said). The
oil company has used its programme both in the traditional way, feeding
Dollars 150m of notes to investors in digestible pieces over a number of
months and by launching a fully-underwritten Dollars 100m issue of 10-year
notes.
Other borrowers which have recently set up Euro-MTN programmes also expect
to use them as an alternative to public bond markets. Two building
societies, Halifax and Leeds, said they expect the programmes to be useful
in a broad range of ways. One use could be to refinance existing Eurobond
issues: Halifax's Eurobonds date back as much as five years, soon after the
mutually owned societies were first permitted to borrow in the capital
markets, and refinancing could be done through MTNs.
How far will this market grow? As the chart shows, a growing proportion of
borrowing in the domestic US debt markets is being done through MTNs. The
Euro-version of this market, though immature by comparison, saw new
programmes set up with a total theoretical limit of Dollars 42bn, compared
with Dollars 31bn the year before.
One thing above all is likely to hold the market back: a perception by
investors that MTN issues are illiquid, compared with Eurobonds. The
perception stems largely from the fact that new note issues are generally
small and are not made fungible (interchangeable) with earlier issues under
the same programme. That raises fears among investors that there is no depth
to the market and that it would be difficult to sell a large holding with
ease.
Mr Ingwe said that in theory, liquidity for large issues should be the same,
whether a company issued paper under a Eurobond offering or through a note
programme. But he added: 'Theory is one thing, reality another.' Many
investors will only buy Eurobonds. 'We have to go to the investor,' he said.
Some bankers go further and claim that liquidity is actually better in the
note market than the bond market. The argument runs like this: prices in the
secondary Eurobond market are determined by market-makers, many of whom set
their prices according to what they believe they could get for the bonds by
selling to another market-maker. Aside from the original lead manager to an
issue, they have little commitment to market making and no continuing
responsibility for the issue. When bonds come on to the market they can
ricochet between market-makers, driving down the price.
MTN dealers, on the other hand, say they have a continuing relationship with
the issuer and are therefore committed to the programme. So if they are
offered bonds in the secondary market, they will make more effort to place
the paper with investors, helping to keep the price closer to true value.
Being a dealer is 'a public commitment,' said Mr Keith Phair, associate
director of NatWest Capital Markets.
This argument over market structure ignores one important point: that
ultimately, prices are determined by what end-investors will pay for them,
and that banks only prosper by selling paper through their distribution
arms, whether bonds or notes. If investors, whether rightly or not, believe
that notes are less liquid than bonds, then fewer will buy them. This in
turn helps to keep notes less liquid.
This circle will only be broken when enough investors have dipped their toes
in the water and concluded that notes are not so bad after all. With the
growing number of treasurers who want to use such funding structures, that
day is getting nearer all the time.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Syndicated Loans: Cyprus returns with Dollars 35m five-year
deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CYPRUS has returned to the international capital markets with a Dollars 35m
five-year syndicated loan for the Electricity Authority of Cyprus.
The Republic of Cyprus last turned to the loans market in September 1991
when it wanted a Dollars 120m five-year standby facility to back its Dollars
200m Eurocommercial paper programme.
The latest deal, arranged and underwritten by Sumitomo Bank and Commercial
Bank of Greece, is guaranteed by the Republic of Cyprus and will be used to
pay for two gas turbines. The margin is 60 basis points over the London
interbank offered rate (Libor), with front-end fees of 25 basis points for
commitments of Dollars 5m, 20 basis points on Dollars 2.5m and 15 basis
points on Dollars 1m.
Bankers point out that the terms on the latest deal are not truly comparable
to those on the earlier Republic of Cyprus transaction which was arranged by
Arab Banking Corporation, Bank of America, Bank of Tokyo, Gulf International
Bank, Manufacturers Hanover Trust, WestLB Group and Girozentrale Vienna.
The Republic of Cyprus facility paid a commitment fee of 35 basis points,
but the margin of 65 basis points over Libor was seen as 'academic' since
the facility provided a backstop to the commercial paper programme to be
drawn in case of emergency.

<TEXT>
THE Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures market, and the
Deutsche Terminborse, the largest options exchange in Europe, have signed a
memorandum of understanding which should clear the way for German government
bond futures trading in Chicago.
The bund is currently traded at the DTB, which also trades futures, and the
London International Financial Futures Exchange.
Under the agreement, the two exchanges said they would examine the
possibility of creating reciprocal offset and clearing systems for the bund
future. Design and modification of the contract's terms, trading hours,
price information sharing and marketing are also to be agreed upon.
German banks, which have already shifted most of their bund trading from
Liffe to DTB, support a Chicago link for the bund. German bank officials
said bund trading at the CBOT would offer arbitrage opportunities and,
because of time differences, extend the hours during which they could trade.
The CBOT, home of the 30-year US Treasury bond future, the world's most
active futures contract, has for some time pursued listing international
bond contracts. Several years ago and again late last year it negotiated
with Liffe on the bund contract, but those talks were inconclusive.
Mr William O'Connor, the CBOT chairman, said that the memorandum, which was
completed at last week's annual meeting of the Futures Industry Association,
was the basis of 'a potentially long and broad relationship between the two
exchanges.'
For the DTB, an electronic exchange which competes for bund business with
Liffe, it is an opportunity to draw trading volume to its market. It also
would provide an international trading and clearing link for members of both
exchanges, said Mr Joerg Franke, chief executive officer of the DTB.

FT  23 MAR 92 / International Company News: Minolta's tricky change of focus
/ A look at a company facing a bleak profit picture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Minolta, the Japanese camera maker, hopes that its scheduled payment today
of Dollars 127.5m to settle a US patent dispute will restore confidence
within an innovative company now confronted by a bleak profit picture.
The dispute with Honeywell, the US technology company, over autofocus
technology capped a three-year period during which Minolta's profits
evaporated, its sales stagnated, and an ambitious drive into the office
equipment market brought only modest results.
With Minolta forecasting an Y8bn (Dollars 59m) loss for the year ending this
month, its first loss for 26 years, the company shares a vulnerability with
other Japanese companies which based business strategies on high quality but
low profitability, and whose margins have shrunk with increasing competition
and international recession.
Patents aside, the Minolta case also highlights the difficulties faced by
Japanese manufacturers attempting a personality change to reduce reliance on
a traditional product line. These companies covered the initial expenses of
transformation during the easy money era of the late 1980s, but now find
themselves with excess capacity, high capital costs, and little experience
in overcrowded markets.
Mr Ned Moro, Minolta's general manager, along with his fellow directors, has
taken a 10 per cent pay cut to show that he is accepting responsibility for
the troubles of a company still proud that its technology was aboard the
first US manned space mission in 1962.
'We wanted to make a direct sacrifice to encourage our employees and our
shareholders,' Mr Moro said. 'We are now reviewing many things. We are
reviewing expenses, and we have decided to cut capital spending. If there
are projects we can delay, we may do so.'
Capital spending is likely to fall to Y10bn from Y13.5bn this year but the
success of the company's overhaul is more likely to depend on the course of
the Tokyo stock market than on cost cutting. Minolta plans to borrow the
Dollars 127.5m Honeywell payment from its banks, and will repay the money by
cashing in unrealised gains on share holdings.
Mr Moro said that the company would like to wait until the Tokyo market
gathers strength, as its unrealised gains have fallen with the collapse of
the Nikkei average. But the longer Minolta waits, the heavier the interest
burden - at the end of last September those unrealised gains totalled
Y58.6bn, down from Y61.3bn in March.
Minolta had recognised that a shift in product emphasis was needed and,
three years ago, announced a plan to reduce the camera share of total sales,
to sharply increase the office equipment share, and to increase the
proportion of domestic sales.
The three-year target was for annual sales of Y300bn, though the company
forecasts only Y220bn for the current year, and for increased sales of
office equipment to push the camera share down to a third of the total - the
figure last year was 44 per cent. It was hoped that domestic sales could be
lifted from about 17 per cent of the total to 33 per cent, though they are
now hovering around 25 per cent.
'We used to have a high market share in this country, but our founder was a
pioneer and committed himself to selling in foreign markets. I don't want to
say that we ignored the domestic market, but we concentrated on foreign
markets,' Mr Moro explained. The strategy, he said, had left the company
exposed to foreign exchange fluctuations and left it under-represented in
the sophisticated Japanese market.
Even domestic camera sales have turned soft in the past year, including
those of the camera for which Minolta is best known, the single-lens reflex.
The market contracted by 9 per cent to 761,000 units and prices fell by as
much as 30 per cent, as makers rapidly introduced new models and discounted
older lines.
Mr Moro explained that winning market share for office automation equipment
was more difficult than expected: 'We have been trying to find our strength
in the market. We had a good zoom plain paper copier, but now everybody has
the zoom copier. We couldn't follow up the engineering with sales.'
In introducing new products and finding new clients, Minolta is facing
similar problems to foreign companies trying to enter the Japanese market.
'One of the problems is that we can't really break through with major
clients. The competitor's merchandise is already on the premises. It is
difficult to convince any Japanese customer to change brands,' Mr Moro said.
The reliance on foreign sales and, in particular, its high-profile in the US
market prompted Minolta's quick settlement with Honeywell, though the speed
of the deal surprised other Japanese camera equipment makers, about 15 of
whom now face litigation.
After a US court awarded Honeywell Dollars 96.35m in damages last month, the
Japanese company had three options - accept the judgment, negotiate with
Honeywell, or appeal. Mr Moro said the two companies began negotiations, and
agreed on the Dollars 127.5m figure, which includes licensing fees.
'We thought of appealing, but it would take a lot of time and money. If we
were not a manufacturer of high-publicity consumer goods, maybe we would
think differently. We decided to lift this burden from our shoulders. Now we
can look ahead.'

DFC New Zealand, the investment bank that sent shock waves through the New
Zealand economy when it collapsed in 1989, has largely repaid its tier-one
debt, three years ahead of schedule, Reuter reports from Wellington.
Creditors with tier-one notes and loans are to be repaid in full three years
earlier than expected, the final NZDollars 235 (Dollars 129m) payment taking
place on April 15, according to Mr Sandy Maier, DFC's statutory manager
Sandy Maier.
The payment would bring to about NZDollars 1bn the amount DFC has paid to
tier one creditors over the last year.
A large part of DFC's debt, which was estimated at about NZDollars 2.2bn at
the time of its failure, is held by Japanese creditors. Mr Maier said the
risk that DFC might default on any of its scheduled repayments had now been
removed.
The government's participation in the DFC restructuring and repayment plan
had included various currency swap transactions needed to hedge DFC's
currency exposure relating to US dollar and yen obligations under its
tier-one debt. These swaps would now be sold or cancelled.

FT  23 MAR 92 / International Company News: History sets its sights on the
Colt hand gun - The pistol has become a victim of tough competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It may have been good enough for Buffalo Bill and scores of other American
pioneers but the Colt pistol is now in danger of finally fading into
history.
The Connecticut-based Colt Manufacturing Company, which was founded in 1836
by Sam Colt, last week filed for protection from creditors under Chapter 11
of US bankruptcy law.
And while the company received an emergency Dollars 10m injection from its
main creditors - the Connecticut Development Authority and Austria's
Creditanstalt banking group - that may not be enough to save the 925 jobs
remaining at its Hartford headquarters.
Colt's history is rich enough. The hand gun, it used to be said, 'made all
men equal.' But Colt has lately become a victim of declining defence
contracts and tough competition from companies such as the British-owned
Smith &amp; Wesson and Italy's Beretta group. At present Colt is believed to
represent less than 7 per cent of the US market in hand guns.
Gun control remains a political controversy in the US, with the Bush
administration doing little to counter the pro-gun lobby. But Colt's weapons
have proved less appealing to sportsmen, criminals and other arms
aficianados than the cheaper and equally deadly 'Saturday night specials'
that have proliferated recently.
In its bankruptcy filing Colt said it failed to make sufficient progress in
a financial restructuring that was agreed two years ago, when the company
was saved with the help of Connecticut state pension funds. At the time a
coalition of Colt workers, managers, private investors and the Connecticut
state pension fund bought 47 per cent of the company, which had been
crippled by a lengthy strike.
As Colt filed for protection from creditors, Mr Anthony Autorino, chairman
and chief executive of Colt, resigned. He was succeeded by Mr Worth Loomis,
president of the Hartford, Connecticut Graduate Centre.
Colt plans to use the Dollars 10m capital injection to reorganise its
finances and perhaps its products. With gun-fever in the US creating more
demand for dangerous semi-automatic weapons, Colt's focus may shift away
from its traditional revolvers.
A sign of the company's declining fortunes is that the police force in
Hartford, Connecticut, does not even pack a Colt. The police in Colt's home
town prefer the Smith &amp; Wesson .45 semi-automatic pistol, made in
Massachusetts by a company that was acquired five years ago by FH Tomkins of
the UK.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANCO Bilbao Vizcaya (BBV), Spain's second largest bank, plans to cut 3,000
jobs and close 300 branches, Reuter reports from Frankfurt.
The bank had 2,771 branches in Spain and 157 offices abroad at the end of
1991. It employed some 28,800 people in Spain at the end of last year.
'To boost productivity some 3,000 jobs will go between 1992 and 1994 and in
order to rationalise our branch network we will close maybe 300 branches
over the next three to four years,' said Mr Alfredo Saenz, first
vice-president.
He said expansion of credit demand this year would be in line with economic
growth in Spain, which BBV predicts will be around 2.5 per cent. He said
lower provisions for bad debt and future pension payouts would underpin
BBV's profits.
This year's incorporation of the group's 217 non-financial companies under
new Bank of Spain accounting guidelines would give BBV's 1992 profits a 5
per cent boost.
The expansion of market share in Spain and an increase in productivity as
BBV quickened the pace of cost savings would result in higher operating
results in 1992, said Mr Saenz.

FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Director resigns at NHL
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BOARDROOM dispute at National Home Loans, the troubled mortgage and
consumer finance group, has led to the resignation of Mr Ken Lewis, the
group's operations director.
Mr Lewis, who had been with NHL since it was established in 1986, was in
charge of marketing, product development and services at the group. He is
understood to have found it difficult to work with Mr Jonathan Perry, a
former director of Morgan Grenfell, who took over as chairman and chief
executive a month ago.
A three line statement from NHL on Friday night said that Mr Lewis had
resigned to pursue other interests. His departure brings the number of
executive directors on NHL's seven-member board down to three. No
replacement has been appointed at this stage.
NHL, once a leading UK mortgage lender, incurred losses of Pounds 47.9m last
year. It has been in the doldrums since July when its banking subsidiary had
to be rescued by a Pounds 200m cash lifeboat from the high street clearers
led by the Bank of England.

CITY analysts will today have plenty of opportunity to cross examine Spring
Ram Corporation, the kitchens and bathrooms group, on how it has beaten the
recession.
The results presentation, which is expected to include a near-25 per cent
increase in pre-tax profit, is being attended by 18 directors from the main
board and subsidiaries. Estimates of the pre-tax figure hover around Pounds
37m to Pounds 38m, compared with Pounds 30.1m in 1990.
What the crowd coming down from Yorkshire should try to explain is how a
company that was a baby in the last recession has tackled this one like a
veteran, while continuing to grow like a stripling.
Mr Bill Rooney, Spring Ram's chairman and joint founder, tends to talk about
enthusiastic people, or even magic beans, suggesting that many of the
reasons are intangible.
However, some more down-to-earth strands can be traced and they weave
themselves into a pattern of growth that has so far proved repeatable.
Cash has been one of the keys. Spring Ram got over a bulge in capital
spending in the late 1980s and in 1989 and 1990 spent only Pounds 3m a year.
Cash held grew to Pounds 31.3m by the end of 1990 and interest contributed
Pounds 2.2m to annual profit.
Last year, even though capital spending was stepped up to nearer Pounds 15m,
the cash pile continued to grow. In the autumn it was on course for a
near-50 per cent expansion to roughly Pounds 45m. This contrasts with the
debt-laden state of its two main rivals in kitchens, Magnet and MFI.
Interest will again have been a profit centre in 1991, with resources
husbanded in the tightest of ways. The Ram collects promptly but takes its
time to pay, for instance.
The more creative part of the equation has been the taking up of the factory
capacity by a growing number of operating companies, created by a process
similar to biological budding.
New subsidiaries have rolled out the range of products into different niches
of the kitchens and bathrooms markets. Last year, the generation of
youngsters coming into profit included Chippendale Kitchens, taking the
group into a more up-market area.
Similarly the channels of distribution have multiplied. Independent
retailers, won over by Spring Ram's marketing support, provided the original
skeleton. It has been fleshed out by the DIY superstores and builders'
merchants - supplied on the bathroom side, for instance, by another young
company called Streamline.
The process is set to continue with companies spun off to supply ceramic
tiles - increasing the product range in a conventional Ram area - and doors,
where a small acquisition followed by factory building is pushing the group
into new parts of the house.
The scale of the group's ambitions can be measured by the Pounds 60m that it
plans to spend on factories over the next two years.
Such heavy investment sounds like a risk and the case for saying it will pay
off is based simply on history. In spite of the switch to cash absorption
and the continued recession, analysts are forecasting a further profit rise
this year - albeit at a slower rate.
This bullishness is reflected in the share price, which has shot up from 63p
at the beginning of last year to 164p earlier this month. Friday's close of
155p is more than 20 times estimated 1991 earnings.
There has been some profit realisation along the way, notably by directors
last summer.
One of them, Mr Francis Galvin, has left and seems set to use the money to
build a rival kitchens business. Perhaps a case of the budding going too
far.
How the group will maintain its entrepreneurial spirit in-house as it gets
bigger - its market value is about Pounds 560m already - is just part of the
inevitable question that will be asked after today's meeting: 'When will it
run out of momentum?'

FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Laura Ashley in US alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAURA ASHLEY, the international fabrics, fashions and furnishings group, has
signed a 10-year contract with Federal Express entrusting its worldwide
distribution arrangements to the US logistics company.
The deal is estimated at Pounds 150m.
The business logistics arm of Federal Express will assume joint
respsonsibility for Laura Ashley's supply chain, helping to ensure the most
efficient delivery of goods from the retailer's international network of
suppliers to its 500 stores in 28 countries.
Federal Express will also work on developing a global home delivery service
by September 1993, enabling Laura Ashley to deliver goods direct to shoppers
within 24 to 48 hours.
This service will use Federal Express's courier services in the US and the
rest of the world but will mainly rely on sub-contractors in Europe.
Federal Express announced last week that it was heavily restructuring its
European parcels delivery operations with the loss of 7,000 jobs.
Mr Jim Maxmin, Laura Ashley chief executive, predicted the move would
greatly improve the company's operating efficiencies and would at a minimum
save Pounds 3m in planned systems development costs.
Additional benefits would result from working capital improvements and the
ability to respond more quickly and flexibly to customers' requirements
especially on the home furnishings side, he said.
As a result of the business alliance, Laura Ashley will shut three
warehouses in the Netherlands, the US and Milton Keynes with the loss of 60
jobs. The company will take a Pounds 4.5m exceptional charge in its accounts
for the year to January 1992 - booked as a post-balance sheet event.

FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Guinness to invest Pounds 53m at Park Royal
brewery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GUINNESS, the UK-based international drinks group, is planning to invest
Pounds 53m in rebuilding its main UK brewery at Park Royal in West London.
The investment will be phased over four years, with the bulk of expenditure
in the first two to three years. Mr Bill Spears, Guinness's director of
public affairs, said the group planned to used existing banking facilities
to fund the investment.
Guinness's debt will rise only marginally as a result. The group reported
borrowings of Pounds 1bn in its annual results on Thursday, with gearing at
just over 50 per cent. Pre-tax profits rose by 13 per cent to Pounds 956m
for the year to December 31, 1991.
The investment programme, which is due to begin in the next few months, will
mean only a fractional increase in the brewery's capacity of 3m hectolitres
 -or 500m pints - a year, said Mr Spears.
The main benefit would be in reducing costs through improving efficiency and
quality control. 'There is every reason to believe that there will be a
significant reduction in costs per hectolitre,' he said.
The programme will also mean the eventual loss of some of the 1,300 jobs at
the 60-year-old brewery, although Mr Spears said it was too early to
quantify the number of redundancies.
Employee representatives endorsed the plan two weeks ago. 'They appreciate
there will be job losses,' Mr Spears said, 'but also that the plan will
secure in the much longer term the jobs which remain.'
Guinness plans to use the investment programme as a opportunity to increase
efficiency and improve working practices, he said.
The brewery, which is situated on a 30-acre site and produces Guinness
stout, Harp lager and Kaliber, the low alcohol beer, would become the 'most
technologically advanced in the UK' as a result of the investment, Mr Spears
said.

FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker rescue moves a step nearer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Pounds 1.65bn refinancing marathon at Brent Walker appears to be finally
drawing to a close with lawyers working over the weekend to incorporate the
final changes to documentation as requested by the leisure group's bank-ers.
Mr John Leach, Brent Walker's finance director, said the group expected
official agreement from the banks on the refinancing by next Tuesday, when
bond holder and shareholder resolutions on the plan expire.
However, Mr Leach sounded a note of caution - well aware that the Brent
Walker negotiations, which began in November 1990, have been some of the
longest and most tortuous in UK corporate history. 'I will believe it is
done when it is done,' he said.
If there is a last-minute hitch, the group will have to call another
extraordinary meeting for shareholder approval of the plan which aims to
convert Pounds 250m of secured bank debt into ordinary and preference
shares. Such a move could throw the refinancing into doubt and push Brent
Walker into receivership.
There are four major agreements which need final approval from Brent
Walker's 50-odd banks. A final draft had been sent to bankers last week and
was returned with nothing more than adjustments to the documentation, said
Mr Leach. The final documentation was expected to have been sent to the
banks today.
Bankers to William Hill, the bookmaking chain bought from Grand Metropolitan
for Pounds 679m in 1989, are also expected to give their official approval
to the refinancing.
The dispute with GrandMet over payments on William Hill had been sidelined,
said Mr Leach. 'There has been no progress on GrandMet. We have agreed to
let negotiations continue.'

FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Liffe and marketmakers resolve argument
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON International Financial Futures Exchange has resolved an argument
with marketmakers which threatened to sabotage its merger with the London
Traded Options Market, allowing the merger to proceed as planned on Sunday.
Mr David Burton, Liffe's chairman, flew back on Friday from the Futures
Industry Association's annual meeting in Boca Raton, Florida, where he was
due to speak, in order to help patch up differences with the six firms which
had agreed to make markets in individual stock options under the new
exchange.
Throughout its four-year history, the merger has been dogged by
disagreements over the best way to resurrect the UK market in individual
stock options, which languished under the control of the stock exchange.
The firms had threatened not to sign up as marketmakers unless Liffe agreed
to appoint a managing director to oversee the development of the stock
options market under the new exchange.
Without marketmakers the merger would have been effectively sabotaged.
The Liffe board decided to resist strong pressure from the marketmakers,
even at the cost of the merger, on the grounds that the merger itself would
be meaningless if the futures and options markets were run separately.
At the eleventh hour, the marketmakers backed down in return for assurances
on the running of the market. A detailed business plan for the equity
options market will be completed in May. 'A compromise was cobbled
together,' said one marketmaker.
Speaking after Friday's board meeting, Mr Michael Jenkins, chief executive
of Liffe, described the merger as 'a genuinely difficult task. We have all
been struggling to find a way forward.'
The merger was postponed in January because an insufficient number of firms
came forward to make markets in the 67 equity options traded on LTOM. While
hopes are running high for the FT-SE index option contract, there seems
little sign that the merger will provide any immediate boost for individual
stock options.
The UK lags other European stock options markets. Volume in French and
German stock options represents around 20 per cent of the volume traded in
the cash market, while UK stock option volume totals a mere four per cent of
the UK stock market.
But Mr Jenkins thought that changes to the structure of the market would
help to boost trading. 'I believe that the new market making arrangements,
coupled with changes in stock borrowing and taxation relief, offer the
potential for a competitive and liquid market,' he said.

FT  23 MAR 92 / UK Company News: Laporte to unveil further details of split
with Solvay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Laporte unveils its preliminary results tomorrow the British specialty
chemicals group also plans to announce details of the proposal to
deconstruct Interox, its Pounds 500m joint venture with Solvay, Belgium's
largest chemicals company.
The decision to dissolve one of the chemical industry's oldest joint
ventures - it has lasted 21 years - follows a divergence of interests
between the two groups.
While Laporte has concentrated since the early 1980s on high-value low
volume products, Solvay has stayed in the capital-intensive bulk chemicals
arena.
Under the terms of the deal presently being negotiated, Solvay will acquire
Interox's bulk hydrogen peroxide and persalts businesses which have a
turnover of about Pounds 200m.
Laporte will acquire the subsidiary's organic peroxides and persulphates
operations which have sales of about Pounds 65m.
In addition, two-thirds of Solvay's 25 per cent stake in Laporte will be
cancelled - equivalent to 16.7 per cent of the group - while the other third
 -representing about 8.3 per cent - will be placed on the market.
Laporte says both hydrogen peroxide, sold to the textiles and paper and pulp
industries, and persalts, used mainly in detergents, do not fit into its
strategy.
The main problem is they are highly capital intensive. Interox's debt over
the last five years has risen from Pounds 25m to more than Pounds 100m, with
most of the increase being used to fund capital programmes in these two
areas.
Prices for hydrogen peroxide have also been falling as the area attracts
more competition.
The British company says Solvay is well placed within the sector because its
caustic soda operations provide hydrogen as a by-product, offering an almost
free resource for peroxide manufacture.
It argues that the Belgian group's integrated operations will put it in a
strong position to cope with a downward pressure on prices.
In contrast, the two businesses Laporte is acquiring - organic peroxides,
used as catalysts to manufacture polymers, and persulphates, required for
the production of acrylic fibres - are not capital intensive.
What they do require is the sort of sophisticated technical processes in
which Laporte specialises. Laporte says these businesses fit into its
strategy of investing in areas with high margins, strong cash-flow and a
high technical content.
Between 1980 and 1990, the proportion of Laporte's profits provided by
specialty chemicals increased from a third to two-thirds.
After Akzo, the Dutch company, Interox is the second largest European
producer of organic peroxides with sales of about Pounds 45m a year.
Laporte estimates the world market, which is growing annually at about 5 per
cent, is worth about Dollars 750m (Pounds 434m).
Interox is also the largest European supplier of persulphates, with sales of
about Pounds 20m. Demand for the chemicals is increasing at about 7 per cent
year, with a market valued at Dollars 120m.
Laporte says the deal will not dilute earnings during the first year and
should significantly enhance them afterwards. Last year Laporte earned a
dividend of Pounds 18.7m from Interox.
However, this should be offset by tax gains, a lower dividend bill because
of the smaller equity base, and a reduced investment programme without the
capital-intensive bulk hydrogen peroxide operations.
The group also expects to make savings by closing Interox's manufacturing
sites in Australia and Brazil, and concentrating its efforts in Munich and
Teesside, where it is investing Pounds 15m over the next two years.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Economics Notebook: Delicate art of balancing tax reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE past two weeks have demonstrated anything, it is that general
elections in Britain are a poor breeding ground for sensible tax reform.
Mr Norman Lamont's budget offended the tax reform lobby with its proposal
for a 20p tax band for the first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. Mr John
Smith's shadow budget for the opposition Labour Party last week was a
mixture of good and bad.
The three classic aims of tax reformers are to promote:
economic efficiency
fairness and
administrative practicality.
Labour's plans for a sharp increase in higher tax rates also raise the
separate issue of how far they might affect the UK's economic performance.
But first to Mr Lamont's budget. It was to be expected the 20p lower tax
band would be badly received by enthusiastic reformers. The independent
Institute for Fiscal Studies, in particular, has campaigned for higher
allowances rather than a reduced rate band on the grounds that the least
well off are helped far more by being taken out of tax than by reducing the
tax they pay.
The lower tax band poses other problems. Low-income taxpayers who only pay
the 20p tax rate but have savings in banks and building societies will have
to claim back part of the 25 per cent basic rate of tax now deducted at
source from their interest earnings. To cope with the change the Inland
Revenue will have to hire an extra 800 staff.
Mr Smith plans to increase the personal allowance by 10 per cent instead of
the statutory 4.5 per cent in Mr Lamont's budget. His shadow budget would
take 740,000 people out of tax at a cost of Pounds 920m against the Pounds
1.77bn cost of the government's lower tax band in 1992-93.
Among other good ideas in the Labour package, the proposed removal of the 2
per cent employees' national insurance contribution (NIC) on earnings under
Pounds 54 a week would remove one of the more crazy anomalies in the British
tax and benefits system. At present, a person earning Pounds 54 a week pays
no contribution, whereas someone earning Pounds 55 a week pays 2 per cent on
his or her income, resulting in a marginal tax rate of 110 per cent.
But Mr Smith's plans to extend the 9 per cent employees' NIC to all
employees earning more than Pounds 405 a week and introduce a top 50 per
cent tax band would almost certainly give new life to the tax avoidance
industry, especially as Labour has no plans as yet to alter capital gains
tax.
Labour's plans to remove the upper-earnings limit for employees' NICs can be
expected to boost payments in kind rather than cash, even though the shadow
budget promises to extend employers' NICs to such perks.
So long as Labour has no plans to add new capital gains tax rates to the
present 25 per cent and 40 per cent rates - and a party official confirmed
that this was the case last Friday - pressure would grow among middle
managers to take income in the form of share options. Any capital gains from
these would attract top tax rates of 40 per cent against the top 59 per cent
levy to be placed on top incomes.
Another curious effect of Mr Smith's plans, given Labour's history as the
workers' party, would be that unearned income will be treated more
favourably than earned income if Labour wins the election.
Mr Smith dropped his original plan to extend the 9 per cent employee's NICs
to interest and dividend income above Pounds 3,000 after a wave of protest
from people who had recently been made redundant. Under Labour, the Duke of
Westminster would therefore pay a marginal tax rate of 50 per cent on his
unearned income while a not-so-affluent manager would lose 59 per cent in
income tax and NICs from every pound earned above a taxable income of Pounds
36,375.
Such developments would fly against the principle of tax neutrality, which
has become the generally accepted goal of finance ministries in the big
industrial countries over the past decade. Neutrality has as its objective a
system that does not distort the workings of market forces or discriminate
against specific groups.
But would Labour's plans do more, and actually damage the UK economy? The
Conservative Party says yes. It claims that by sharply increasing the
effective top rate of tax from 40 per cent to 59 per cent at relatively low
income levels, Labour would reduce incentives. The Tory manifesto reflects
this view, declaring: 'Lower taxes have encouraged more people to work
harder - not to spend their time working out how to avoid penal taxes.'
This is an issue over which economists cannot agree. While supply-siders
support the Conservative view, others argue that changes in tax rates can
have little effect on how hard most people work because employees have
little direct influence over their levels of output or their hours at work.
There is more evidence that marginal tax rates have incentive or
disincentive effects on so-called 'secondary workers', who are frequently
married women doing part-time jobs. In so far as Mr Smith's Budget would hit
the net income of heads of households, it might encourage their hitherto
unemployed partners to seek work. On the other hand, there are likely to be
some highly paid secondary workers - notably in the South East of England -
for whom Labour's plans would act as a disincentive.
The fact that Labour's planned 59 per cent top tax rate would bite at a
relatively low income level makes any forecast of its effects difficult.
The UK had a top rate of 60 per cent as recently as 1988. But when
parliament approved that rate - in Mr Nigel Lawson's 1987 budget - it
applied to taxable incomes worth more than Pounds 56,000 in today's money
against Pounds 36,375 in Mr Smith's plan.
By the standards of other industrialised democracies, Mr Smith's draft
budget proposes tax increases of unusual severity for a significant minority
of people. It is open to doubt whether such a radical tax change would be
possible under forms of democracy other than Britain's first-past-the post,
winner-take-all electoral system.

FT  23 MAR 92 / EC seen as threat to City success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE biggest threat to London's status as a leading financial centre comes
from ill-conceived regulation, especially new EC directives. That is the
preliminary conclusion of the first study by the City itself into what
determines its success as a financial centre.
The City Research Project's interim report, prepared by the London Business
School with funding from the Corporation of London, identifies three issues
 -regulation, the structure of markets and government policies to encourage
internationally oriented businesses - as central to London's future success.
The report, shows the remuneration of senior City executives is generally
lower than on Wall Street or Tokyo. Senior fund managers, equity traders and
foreign exchange dealers earn more in Tokyo and in New York than in London.
However, cash compensation packages are higher than Frankfurt and Paris. The
report found that corporate finance executives, who advise companies on
takeovers and fund-raising, earn more in London - almost Pounds 160,000 a
year on average - than elsewhere in the world.
The preliminary report aims to identify areas needing further study. Mr
Stanislas Yassukovich, former chairman of the Securities Association who
initiated the research and is chairman of the project's governing board,
said: 'Regulation is probably the top issue.'
He highlighted dangers to the City from European Directives aiming to impose
common rules on European financial centres.
Markets were so different, he said, that uniform rules might not be
appropriate. He cited the example of recent attempts by the EC and
regulators of securities firms to devise a common standard for the amount of
capital each securities firm must maintain - their capital adequacy ratios -
as a protection against financial shocks.
'In the London market, securities firms have access to hedging instruments
and can use devices designed to share risk with partners', he said. As a
result, London securities firms might be less exposed to risk than rivals in
Frankfurt or Paris. So it might be unfair to impose the same capital
requirement and associated costs on a London securities firm as on a
Continental-based firm.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Failure grounds Chinese space hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S fledgling commercial space programme was grounded yesterday with the
failure of its Long March 3 rocket to put an Australian communications
satellite into orbit.
As a result, the worldwide satellite industry and its customers in
telecommunications and broadcasting face delays and higher fees for launches
and insurance.
Likely victims include Mr Ted Turner, owner of the CNN satellite television
service, Hughes Aircraft of the US, the biggest satellite maker in the
world, and Cable and Wireless, the UK telecommunications company which
partly owned the Australian satellite. The countdown in Sichuan province,
south-west China, progressed smoothly but the rocket did not take off when
the motors ignited.
'In scientific pursuits, failure is unavoidable and frequent,' said China's
Great Wall Industrial Corporation, which oversees the marketing of satellite
services to foreign customers.
Hughes Aircraft, which made the satellite, said: 'With the ignition there
was an indication that there may have been a problem, which they detected on
their instruments. It went into emergency shutdown.'
The commercial launch vehicle is a modified intercontinental ballistic
missile. The strap-on engine, which appeared on Chinese television to have
caught fire, was one of two booster rockets on the original missile.
But launch schedules, planned years in advance, will have to be rewritten.
Australia faces a particularly pressing problem since yesterday's satellite
was intended to replace one due to go out of service later this year.
CNN hopes to broadcast to the Middle East and Africa on a satellite
scheduled for launch on Long March 3 next year. The failure will disrupt
plans by Sweden and Malaysia for launches in China.
Insurance brokers and underwriters will re-examine their satellite premiums.
The Long March 3 launches already command a higher premium - about 18 per
cent of the typical Dollars 100m (Pounds 57.8m) cost of a satellite - than
their rivals.
There are only a handful of satellite launchers in the world. They include
Ariane, in Europe, and General Dynamics in the US. In an effort to break
into this lucrative market, China has been offering sharply lower prices
than the Dollars 70m-Dollars 90m charged by western organisations.
China has launched 31 satellites since sending its first rocket into space
in 1964.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Letters To The Editor: Challenges to the Alan Sugar view (2)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr COLIN FISHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I could not let Alan Sugar's letter pass without response because of
the high regard in which I hold him.
Like him - but not on his scale - my partners and I have built up a
successful and profitable business from scratch through the 1970s and 1980s.
For most of that time the marginal rate of tax was not 40 per cent but 85
per cent initially and latterly 60 per cent - I had no unearned income to be
taxed at 98 per cent.
The marginal rate of tax made not one whit of difference to our efforts to
grow our business. If anything, the fact that the marginal rate was high
encouraged us to do what we wanted to do anyway - invest in our business.
While I accept it may be different for corporate managers, for those of us
who grew our businesses the combination of a tough marginal rate (and 60 per
cent is tough enough) and a corporate tax regime which encouraged retention
and reinvestment was good for business growth.
The current bias towards distribution introduced by Nigel Lawson is ideal if
as a society we want all our business builders to retire at 35 and all our
corporate managers to see the choice as between paying themselves or paying
shareholders.

   From PAUL GOGGINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It is rare to encounter an emotional outburst in a newspaper which
prides itself on fact and accurate analysis. It is perhaps a healthy thing
in this age of slick political advertising that people still have a chance
to speak from the heart, but Alan Sugar's letter (March 19) simply cannot go
unchallenged.
First, he bemoans his 'meagre salary' of Pounds 170,000 and the collapse in
the value of his shares to Pounds 100m. Before he complains too loudly
perhaps he should consider the fact that the same society which has provided
his markets and opportunities has also seen a doubling of poverty in the
1980s and 1990s with about 12m people on incomes below half the average.
Behind this statistic are real people who simply do not have enough to feed
and clothe themselves.
Second, he suggests that yesterday's 'barrow boys' are today's share dealers
and that limitless opportunity is there for all to grasp if they want to. He
should realise that for many, prosperity is prevented by crumbling schools,
poor-quality training and dearth of job opportunities.
Mr Sugar acknowledges that more should be done to help the poor but his
claim that the 'them and us' situation has disappeared is total nonsense;
2.7m unemployed people, 0.5m homeless people, and 10m people dependent on
means-tested benefits bear witness to that.
If only the talent, enterprise and organisation which Mr Sugar told us has
gone into making and marketing satellite dishes was put into solving the
housing and unemployment crises, perhaps we could end the scandal of
poverty. Paul Goggins,

FT  23 MAR 92 / Letters To The Editor: Nothing voluntary in low pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Professor BRIAN TOWERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan's disappointment over the quality of the debate on the
economy in the election campaign so far (Economic Viewpoint, March 19) is
certainly justified. It falls short of even the mediocre, with little
attempt to relate the proposals put before the electorate to macroeconomic
goals, especially economic growth and the reduction of unemployment.
Yet Brittan himself is not above criticism on the score of shallow thinking.
Why is it that economists of his persuasion straying into labour market
analysis refuse to reconstruct themselves on the basis of the evidence? His
'consenting adults' model is catchy but pure fiction. Low-paid workers
generally remain in their condition because labour markets are segmented.
They have no realistic possibility of improving their pay and conditions
given limited employment alternatives and the overwhelming bargaining
advantage of their employers.
To perceive this as a voluntary bargain between even approximate equals is a
nonsense.
Intervention to redress this imbalance can be via government or collective
bargaining. Neither of these is perfect, but while they may lead to some
negative consequences for employment, research also suggests some positive
benefits for productivity. A particular example of this is the minimum wage
which has been well researched in the UK both in its wages council and
single national minimum forms.
For its social as well as its economic implications it is important to
address with some seriousness the scandal of widespread and endemic low pay
and poverty in employment. Samuel Brittan's casual blackboard theorising
will not do.

First, women at present constitute 18.5 per cent of the total number of
practising barristers in England and Wales, not 9 per cent.
Second, the survey is being funded jointly by the Bar Council and the Lord

FT  23 MAR 92 / Fault-lines spread from without to within: After a divisive
meeting in Kiev, the republics of the former Soviet Union face a mounting
crisis of cohesion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Leonid Kravchuk's astonishing display of frankness at the end of the
summit meeting of the Commonwealth of Independent States on Friday has
effectively undercut whatever grounds that organisation may have for
remaining in effective existence - though its paper form may continue for
some time yet.
The Ukrainian president said the CIS had done nothing useful in its short
life of four months; that it was probably doomed; that Russia would never
permit a discussion of the division of what had been Soviet property at home
and abroad, and is now effectively Moscow's property since Russia has
proclaimed itself the successor state to the Soviet Union.
Though he is living dangerously, Mr Kravchuk has little choice but to take a
tougher line with Moscow and little reason for preserving the pretence of
harmonious co-operation between the CIS partners. The national temper
continues to rise in Ukraine, as every Russian act is interpreted as
threatening, and Mr Kravchuk relies increasingly on the nationalist parties
and groups for his political survival.
The best reason for staying within the CIS was to retain leverage over the
Russians and to try to persuade them to moderate energy price rises. But it
seems certain Ukraine will soon lose that battle. Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the
Russian energy minister, is likely to cut subsidies for oil supplies to
Ukraine.
Hence Ukraine's stance at the CIS meeting; hence the underscoring by General
Konstantin Morozov, the Ukrainian defence minister, of the fact that Ukraine
has signed no military treaties with other CIS members; hence the comments
by senior Ukrainian officials that this was the last, or at best the
penultimate, Commonwealth summit.
Since the Ukrainian-Russian relationship is the indispensable pivot of any
such grouping, this probably means the end. But this is no bad thing: the
reasons for the Commonwealth were high-sounding but empty, like much of the
former communist rhetoric of the Gorbachev period. However, unlike still
earlier communist rhetoric, there is no underlying coercive strength, rooted
in the party and the secret police, to ensure cohesion remains.
There are good reasons for a Commonwealth - the need to preserve economic
ties, to develop civilised approaches to each others' minorities, to address
the national conflicts, to divide property rationally, to maintain common
services and common security and to assist in the similar tasks with which
all are confronted in their stated aims of making the transition from
totalitarianism to democracy and capitalism.
But these ambitions are now for the birds. Nationalism is far too strong and
the resurrection of long-buried grievances too common. Add to this the
interests of the ruling elites in the republics - who see diplomatic
prestige and opportunities for self-enrichment in greater independence - and
it is easy to grasp the lack of interest in doing more than observe the
pieties of post-Soviet co-operation.
The Friday session of the CIS showed that Ukraine is ready to propose itself
as the model for this process towards greater independence: insisting on its
right to be a nation unencumbered by the anomalies which the Soviet past has
left, such as the presence on its territory of military formations owing
their allegiance to another state power.
The contrary pole is occupied by Russia, which wants the Commonwealth to
stay together. However, it has no clear position on what posture to adopt
within the organisation. In general, the temptation for any Russian
government is to conflate the former Soviet Union with present Russia, to
claim and hold former USSR property and assets, and to seek some general
hegemony over the former Soviet area, mainly on security grounds. Russians
of any opinion would agree that a potentially hostile government in Kiev
would be intolerable, although they would divide on whether or not to
prevent that by diplomacy or, ultimately, force. Russia thinks of itself as
a great power, and does not think that way about any other member of the
Commonwealth.
It is thus difficult for it to take seriously the national agendas of
countries like Ukraine, since Moscow's first concern is to ensure they do
not threaten or harm the superior world role of Russia.
The Ukrainian challenge forces Russia to face up to life after the Soviet
empire - a painful process since it is certain to be replete will all kinds
of insults from former dependencies - and one which is fraught with danger.
But there is no alternative, for the neighbouring states or for Russia, if
it is to fulfil its wish to become part of the modern world.
But there is an even more painful matter for Russia, lurking within its
borders. This is the future status of the autononomous areas and
non-ethnic-Russian people on its territory. Other republics have such
problems too. Georgia and Azerbaijan, for example, are in a state of war
with minorities.
But Russia has by far the largest dilemma in the shape of the peoples who
are the descendants of Caucasian, Siberian, or other races. Some of these
minorities number just thousands, others, numbered in millions, often have
territory named after them. These areas are now home to stirrings of
nationalism.
The most populous of them, Tatarstan, has just voted for independence with a
62 per cent majority. Its ethnic people, the Volga Tatars, make up some 48
per cent of the nearly 5m of the autonomous republic's population: Russians
account for some 42 per cent.
It remains to be seen how far the leadership of the republic will go. The
best guess must be that Mr Mintimer Shamiyev, the president and a former
Communist party first secretary for the republic, will push it as far as he
can. Tatarstan pumps 30m tonnes of oil a year, enough to make it rich if it
did not have to share them with the rest of Russia.
Of the other 19 autonomous republics within Russia, only Chechenia in the
Caucasus has also said it will be independent (it also has oil, and is even
more Moslem). The other 18 last week initialled a federative treaty, under
which they were given some important concessions - including joint control
of mineral rights - but agreed to allow Moscow to be responsible for most
state-like functions. However, this has to be ratified by the parliaments of
these republics. Already, the Kabardina-Balkaria republic in the Caucausus
has demanded changes before it signs up.
Russia has a problem of vast scope here. Other empires were able to slough
off their subject peoples, and were usually able to wring their hands at a
safe distance over post-imperial conflicts. Russia's empire was both
contiguous (the former Soviet republics) and internalised (the autonomous
republics and districts). It may be able to let the first part go and work
out a modus vivendi with its members. But it is beyond present understanding
how it can at the same time allow the autonomous republics the freedom some
of them desire while constructing a unitary Russian state in which all have
equal rights and duties.
The Commonwealth may be nearly finished, but the drama of the large and
small nations emerging from the ruins of the Soviet Union is only now
beginning.

Small companies welcomed Norman Lamont's Budget measures to encourage big
companies to pay their bills on time. So why, ask the approved managers in
last November's BT sale, has the government still not paid them? According
to government officials, the approved managers, mainly small stockbrokers,
submitted inaccurate bills - now they have been sorted out the brokers
should get paid next month. Not so, according to the said managers who had
been led to believe it could take a year to pay them. Whatever happens, it
does not seem likely that the government will pass the Lamont bill-paying
test.

There was something not quite right about last week's excellent annual
Coopers Deloitte PLC Awards dinner at London's Grosvenor House hotel. True,
attendance at what used to be known as the USM dinner was 17 per cent up on
a year ago and guest speaker Norman Tebbit, the Conservative party's old
hachet man, was in rollicking form.
Perhaps it was the drink, but Observer had some difficulty reconciling
Tebbit's enthusiastic support for Britain's small companies with his own
undoubted preference to sit on the boards of not particularly well-managed
corporate giants like BT, Sears and BET. Then there was David Goldman, chief
executive of The Sage Group, who won the entrepreneur of the year award.
Unlike most of the other self-made types at the dinner, Goldman is a
socialist, and proud to be one. There ought to be more like him.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Observer: Play the game
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Does England have Australia media tycoon Kerry Packer to thank for its
surprise win against South Africa in yesterday's semi-final of the cricket
world cup?
Few people understand the new rules for rain-affected matches and even fewer
can identify who thought them up. The controversial item is covered in the
'Play and Conditions for the World Cup' which is approved by the
International Cricket Conference.
Even so there is a suspicion that cricket's grey administrators, who agreed
the new rule, may have been over-influenced by the need to keep their TV
paymasters happy. The Sunday Times' reported last week that the idea behind
the present rule came from Australia's voice of cricket Richie Benaud via
PBL Marketing, a consultancy which has been closely identified with Kerry
Packer's channel 9 TV network. Benaud is not on the organising committee but
given his stature in the game his opinions are bound to get a hearing.
There is no dispute about the sense of designing a rule to get a result at
all costs. What is odd is the arbitrariness of the rules. The match was
already being floodlit so it could easily have been continued after the
showers.
However, this might have caused havoc with the local TV schedules,
especially if Australia had been playing.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Observer: Stand up and be counted
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of Observer's grouchiest bugbears is so-called general knowledge
quizzes. Besides being tarted up with names like Mastermind when all they
really call for is memory, the knowledge they test is rarely if ever
general.
What most of them are about is solely arts-type knowledge, with scientific
and mathematical questions hardly ever getting a look in.
So hearing the Ashburnham Arms in London's Greenwich runs an unusually good
quiz on Tuesdays, Observer called in . . .only to be disappointed. It
suffered from the same fault.
Seeing my black looks, however, the pub's tenants Dave and Debbie Head
agreed to let Observer sponsor seven numeracy-linked questions as a
supplement to the next regular contest. On the night, some 40 people took
part. The average score was lowish at 2.9 points out of the possible seven.
But two contenders got four points, another got five, and the winner scored
six.
Which prompted the idea of printing the questions to see whether FT-readers
could do any better. They are:
1 What is the conventional name for the result of dividing the circumference
of a circle by its diameter?
2 What is 12 1/2 per cent of 60 per cent?
3 If 93 people enter a knock-out singles tournament at tennis, how many
matches are needed before one player emerges as overall winner?
4 Paper sizes, such as A3 and A4, are designed so that when any size is cut
in two half-way down its longer side, the result is two smaller sheets each
the same shape as the bigger one. In which case, if the length of the
shorter side is taken as 1, what mathematical relationship to that 1 is
borne by the longer side?
5 Name the ancient philosopher specifically associated with the theorem
which sheds light on question 4.
6 What - apart from the fact that no other number is the same as it - is
unique about the number 1,729?
7 Name the unusual mathematician who saw the answer to question 6 instantly?
There, then, is the challenge. Whereas the pub's customers had only an hour
to work on it (they are of course barred from entering this re-run), readers
have until the last post tonight to mail their entries, or until 6pm London
time to fax them to Observer on 071-873 3926 or, if that's engaged, 071-873
3196. Telephoned entries won't be accepted.
The winner gets a bottle of malt whisky. If necessary, there'll be a
tie-breaker consisting of a straight question plus an ultimate decider
testing not numeracy, but extra sensory perception.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Leading Article: US struggle for the centre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT HAS been a strange election year in the US and only a fool would rule out
further twists and turns of fate. But the current probable outcome is that
the battle for the the White House will be fought between President George
Bush for the Republicans and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas for the
Democrats. This promises to be a classic struggle for the centre and one
which should offer at least a reasonable choice.
Mr Clinton proclaims now, as he has in the past, that he is an architect of
change. He comes armed with a pocketful of programmes and an inclination for
intervention. He does not consider industrial policy a dirty word, but he is
no visceral protectionist. He senses that the issues most concerning his
country - health, education, welfare, crime, drugs, investment, taxes - are
those that can and should be addressed by an activist government. Still, Mr
Clinton does not seem to be a classic free-spending Democrat, even though
the Republicans will try and paint him as such.
Mr Bush won the presidency on the Reagan legacy and, after some departure
from it, now says he is back on course. This means less government, less
regulation, lower spending and lower taxes. It does not exclude programmes
to meet specific needs, but it is more inclined to let the market, and the
individual, decide. Mr Bush is basically happy with the status quo.
Uneven recession
Mr Clinton must argue, as the challenger, that there is something
fundamentally wrong with the US economy. Mr Bush, as the incumbent, must
hope it will come right in time of its own accord, with more than a little
help from the Federal Reserve. The latest numbers suggest it might, though
whether to the point that it becomes his decisive ace-in-the-hole is
questionable. This recession has not only been long but its severity has
been unevenly distributed. Confidence in recovery may be equally spotty and
hurt the president in states he needs to carry - California, for example.
Mr Bush brings to the fight a foreign policy record Mr Clinton has had no
opportunity to match, and the issue of experience in external affairs must
be an asset. But it far from clear that it ranks high on the list of public
concerns at present, nor is it an impregnable asset.
There is an impression that this administration has somewhat lost its way
since the Gulf war: it is bogged down in the Middle East, and aggravating
Israel profoundly, which might cost at the polls; it is short of ideas on
how best to aid the former Soviet Union and unable to achieve a break
through in Gatt or, probably, bring to signature this year the North
American Free Trade Area. Still, holding the foreign policy cards usually
works to a president's advantage.
Clinton's character
Neither man enjoys the confidence of their party's activists, which is
probably to their credit, since neither the Democratic left nor the
Republican right have much more than slogans to offer now. But the country
is patently disenchanted with politics-as-usual and both are more than
usually political. The Democratic Party's reconciliation with Mr Clinton is
at this stage much less than the Republicans with Mr Bush. There is a lot of
professional admiration for Mr Clinton's handling of the many allegations
laid against him, but his character, in the broadest sense, is an issue in
ways in which, rightly or wrongly, Mr Bush's is probably not. If he
seriously stumbles, his party would run a mile.
Mr Clinton, however, has advantages over and beyond being from the south,
currently a Republican stronghold, and not living in Washington. He is much
younger than Mr Bush, who shows his age sometimes, and probably more
articulate. This would be useful in any debate betwen the two, but not
necessarily predictably, as the Reagan-Carter confrontation proved.
It would be good if the battle between them could be joined soon, even
though the election is still more than seven months away. This would be
preferable to the current unedifying partisan battle between Mr Bush and the
Democrats in Congress, from which the country emerges no wiser and no more
assured that the policies that will guide it are rooted in sense.

FT  23 MAR 92 / More spring in the cat: Jaguar's new chairman has to make
Ford's investment in the company pay off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Since Ford acquired Jaguar for Pounds 1.6bn in late 1989, the UK luxury car
maker's losses have mounted inexorably, while its sales have almost halved.
This week, Mr Nick Scheele, a 48-year-old career Ford executive, takes over
as chairman and chief executive. His task is to restore the lustre to the
tarnished Jaguar name and undertake the most ambitious new product programme
in the company's history.
Whatever their private doubts, Ford's top executives declare publicly that
their commitment to the Coventry-based prestige car maker is not wavering.
They insist that the strategy of taking Ford, the world's second-largest car
maker, into the highest echelon of the luxury car market through the
acquisition of Jaguar was right.
'We all voted for it, none of us was in the men's room,' insists Mr Allan
Gilmour, Ford executive vice-president.
The financial pain at Jaguar is severe, and Ford has been forced to add
fresh equity to shore up Jaguar's balance sheet after its record Pounds 226m
pre-tax loss last year. Yet Mr Louis Ross, head of Ford's international
automotive operations, claims that Ford is prepared to take the long view of
its acquisition.
'We bought Lincoln (the US luxury car marque) in 1921, and it was 1963
before it made a profit. We are going to beat that record substantially.'
But the targets for putting Jaguar back on the road are more onerous, and Mr
Scheele admits that he faces a 'fairly daunting task'.
Born in Essex and a modern languages graduate from Durham University, Mr
Scheele has been on a fast track at Ford since joining the group as a
graduate trainee in 1966.
After spending 12 years with Ford of Britain, he moved to the US in 1978 to
work on developing a world strategy for parts and materials purchasing. He
eventually ran the Dollars 10-Dollars 12bn purchasing budget for most of
Ford's North American assembly plants.
Mr Scheele has been parachuted into Jaguar from Mexico City. For the last
four years, he has been president of Ford of Mexico, where in contrast to
the challenge at Jaguar, the main problem was how to increase output to meet
rapidly rising demand in the domestic market.
Mr Scheele has to fill the vacuum that will be left by the early departure
through poor health of Mr Bill Hayden, one of the most experienced
manufacturing executives in the European car industry.
Within months of arriving at Jaguar in 1990, Mr Hayden - one of the first
European car executives to recognise the scale of the competitive threat
posed by the Japanese car industry - was comparing its Brown's Lane assembly
plant with the Russian car plant in Gorky. He quickly saw that Jaguar's
engineering and manufacturing operations suffered from fundamental quality
and productivity weaknesses.
In the last two years, he has worked hard to reform the company's antiquated
working practices and to introduce rigorous cost and quality control
systems.
Under the burden of recession in its two main markets, the US and the UK,
Jaguar sales have plunged precipitously. Production fell to only 23,018
units last year from the peak of 51,939 in 1988. The workforce has been cut
to 8,000 from 12,100 in the last 12 months.
Mr Hayden's tough reforms are starting to pay off, however. Mr Scheele says
productivity improved by 23 per cent last year and that the company is on
course for a further 25 per cent gain in 1992.
Ford has brought in its own Uniform Product Assessment System for auditing
quality, and by this measure the number of defects per hundred finished cars
coming off the Jaguar assembly line has been reduced to less than 500 from
close to 2,500 in early 1990.
'I hesitate to think what it was like two and half years ago,' says Mr
Scheele.
It will be a long haul but the agenda is clear. Mr Scheele says: 'We must
continue the progress in productivity and quality, develop the new model
programme, generate sales, and get a return that is not a disaster.'

<TEXT>
Two things stand out from a recent visit to Japan. One is the quality, range
and sheer style of much of the newest architecture. The other is the
advanced and forward thinking nature of the higher echelons of the Japanese
building and contracting industry.
I was impressed by the willingness on the part of corporate clients to build
large, expensive, often experimental, buildings - something that is
relatively rarely done in the UK. The very high price of land in the
capital, Tokyo, makes the actual cost of a building relatively cheap, which
may explain the willingness to commission bold designs. High site values can
, of course, also mean that buildings of a low standard are erected quickly
and cheaply, their quality only controlled by official regulations. I
suspect that the strong, almost fierce, corporate competitiveness is mainly
responsible for the need to impress by architectural innovation as well as,
the now expected Japanese technological ingenuity.
One of the most interesting and important new office towers in Tokyo is the
Century Tower, the result of a three-way cooperation between client,
architect and contractor. Kazuo Akao, who runs the Obunsha Publishing Group,
acted as developer; his choice of designer was the British architect Sir
Norman Foster; and the contractor was the Obayashi Corporation.
Mr Akao is an aficionado of contemporary art and a collector of the work of
artists like Carl Andre and Richard Long (he also has a remarkable
collection of traditional Japanese art). His admiration of Norman Foster's
work stems from his enthusiasm for the headquarters of the Hongkong Shanghai
Bank in Hong Kong which he visited and studied in detail before
commissioning him to build in Tokyo.
Century Tower has been open for about ten months and is already seen as an
exemplar of advanced office design. Situated in the central Bunkyo-ku
district of Tokyo, it is first seen from the south, rising above the canal.
The most striking feature is the dominant entrance facade, an eccentrically
braced steel frame rising up the front of the building like a vertical line
of Shinto-like arches.
Because of the possibility of earthquakes in Japan, seismic shock resistance
plays an important role in the design of any new building. Main structural
floors are known as stability floors and they are double height. Century
Tower is in fact two towers - a south tower of 21 floors and a north tower
of 19 - linked by an atrium. A giant red and white mast stands on top of the
taller tower, adding both height and colour.
The visitor enters the block from the street underneath one of the giant
structural arches. The first impression of the huge entrance is of calm
elegance. You walk on a black granite floor, drawn towards the sombre black
water table, two enormous blocks of Zimbabwe granite covered by a sheet of
moving water. This mirrors the whole space while making a gentle, soothing
sound as the water overflows down the sides of the granite blocks alongside
the stairs that lead to the basement. These mesmerising water sculptures
were designed by the American water artist, Richard Chaix, from Carmel,
California. They are beautiful - almost ritualistic - in their strong
presence. The ancient symbolism of the purifying effect of water at the
temple's entrance is interpreted here in a modern form.
A glance upwards from the grey, granite elegance of the entrance hall
reveals the height of the atrium and the visible office floors. Another
glance to the rear of the hall and you observe the spectacular glass roof
that shelters the swimming pool, health club and restaurant on the lower
floors. This is a superb sweep of glass that follows a perfect catenary
curve (the curve that you would get from a chain or rope hanging freely from
two fixed points that are not in the same vertical line). This sweeping
shape also has visual associations with traditional curved roofs of Japanese
shrines of the Nagare, Hie and Kasuga periods.
Lured by the gentle flow of the water slipping over the black granite, most
visitors with no business appointment would descend to the Century Museum on
the lower floor. Foster likens this to a journey into a cave and certainly
you move from the dripping black walls into a dark, rich room. This is lined
with simple glazed show cases displaying some of Mr Akao's collection of
Oriental art and sculpture, quite magnificently lit by lighting designer
Claud Engel. The Health Club and Thai restaurant beneath the sweeping curved
glass roof are both incredibly elegant. Although it was hard to see the
pool, so exclusive is the club, I did glimpse a row of fountains beneath
palm trees and sense the simplicity of the dark, empty pool.
The contractor, Obayashi, had a daunting task making the innovative Foster
design operate within the tight Tokyo building and safety regulations. That
it has succeeded by ingenious interpretations of the fire codes within the
open nature of the plan is impressive.
With any Norman Foster creation one has come to expect only the highest
quality of finish and detail. In Tokyo this is certainly the case. There is
also the Foster absence of colour, even a relentless greyness about the
environment. However, I saw the building on a grey, snowy day and so did not
experience the play of brightness and light that is the main reason behind
the great top lit atrium that brings natural light to every floor in a way
that seems simple but is, in fact, very hard to achieve effectively.
Two questions are promted by the Century Tower. Why do we not have a
comparable large commercial office tower by Foster in the UK, and why has
Foster's elegant design for an hotel in Knightsbridge, London, recently been
refused planning permission? Tokyo sees the point of elegance. Has the City
of Westminster planning committee no vision at all?

FT  23 MAR 92 / Arts: A glimpse of the golden age at the Biblioteque-Musee -
In Paris Ronald Crichton visits the refurbished Palais Garnier and a
performance of Elektra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD CRICHTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pavilion forming the West wing of the old Opera, the Palais Garnier, was
intended as a ceremonial entrance for Napoleon and Eugenie, who had survived
an attempted assassination some years earlier outside the previous opera
house in the rue Le Peletier. By the time Garnier's building was ready the
Second Empire had collapsed and the former Emperor had died in exile at
Chislehurst.
For more than a century the pavilion has housed a fabulous collection
devoted to opera and the dance, the property of the Biblioteque Nationale,
consulted by writers and students many of whom, as I used to, may have felt
a little overawed by the surroundings - at once tradition-haunted and fusty.
There were temporary exhibitions which could be visited from the auditorium
during intervals. The one mounted for Robert le diable added a good deal to
the effect of that opera's revival a few years ago.
Recently the Ministry of Culture, the Biblioteque Nationale, the Opera,
Louis Vuitton and AROP combined (in perfect harmony, it appears - finished
on time, budget not exceeded) to redesign and refurbish that part of the
huge building. The result is officially called 'Biblioteque-Musee de
l'Opera'. In spite of the joint title, library and museum are now separated
by an isophonic partition: seekers after truth are shielded from mere
visitors wandering round the portraits, drawings, caricatures, models and
posters.
The new entrance is inside the main building, not as before in the rue
Scribe. The monumental staircase which led from the side entrance is
incorporated into the museum itself for temporary exhibitions. The noble
proportions and bare walls, which must disconcert those who associated
Garnier's architecture with rampageous gilt-encrusted decoration, would
still look austere even if the imperial eagles and initials had been
sculpted on them as planned. The new vitrines and furniture are the work of
Richard Peduzzi, Cherau's designer for the Paris Lulu and for the 1978 Ring
at Bayreuth. (Open everyday except Sundays, 10-4.30.)
The special exhibition now showing, in support of the Picasso ballet
programme described last Wednesday by Clement Crisp, is The Ballets Russes
at the Opera. Not all Diaghilev's scandals and successes happened here - the
Chatelet and the Champs-Elysees were also much involved. There is still
plenty to show, from the time of the Boris Godunov of 1908 which started the
whole thing off, up to Diaghilev's death in 1929. Many of the objects have
been seen at loan exhibitions elsewhere and still more are familiar from
reproductions, yet their impact remains as fresh as ever - the strength of
invention, the range and versatility, the constant ability to use modern art
in a theatrical context, from Golovin, Bakst and Benois up to Picasso,
Matisse and Chelitchev. The wealth has been mined by succeeding generations
but it is hard to throw off a feeling of decline.
After these golden-age glimpses the Elektra shared with Los Angeles (where
Max Loppert reviewed it) and Houston, now at the Bastille, looks a rather
sad affair in John Bury's rubbly, ugly-ugly and, worse, uninteresting set.
One wondered why it was thought worth while to bring half way across the
world a production (originally by David Pountney, staged for Paris by Clare
West) now chiefly remarkable for its failure to strike more than
intermittent sparks from some powerful singers.
In the title-role Gabriele Schaut, one felt, was poised for a fine
performance which never quite materialised. Her top notes, cutting but not
strident, winged out as if they would shoot across Paris and shake the
Eiffel Tower. Rapid phrases were boxy and incomprehensible. Helga Dernesch's
Clytemmestra, a potentially fascinating study of a thoroughbred gone
disastrously wrong, did not project strongly enough in the unfriendly
spaces. The Chrysothemis of Karen Huffstodt had vivid moments. In the brief
role of Aegisthus Jean Dupouy was blessedly clear, but no Aegisthus can save
an Elektra
Under the Danish conductor Michael Schonwand the orchestra delivered
thunderous climaxes and, as usual, some expert woodwind playing, with little
of the genuine Straussian warmth. Acoustical problems in this theatre are
not yet solved. Nothing so simple as the orchestra drowning the voices. The
two in some way hard to define don't sit down together, with results
unsatisfying and tiring to the ear. In fairness I report that a packed house
loved it all.
June Anderson having cancelled her solo recital at the Opera-Comique
thorough illness, there was just time to get to the Champs-Elysees to hear
another popular American star, Chris Merritt, give a whopping programme of
Bellini, Donizetti and Rossini. This tenor's particular strength lies in the
unusual way he combines technical agility with heroic vigour. The heroic
side may be gaining the upper hand. Merritt looked like Siegfried and often
sounds like him: I was ready for him to launch at any moment into the
Forging Songs.
He opened with an 'A te, O cara' from I puritani which wouldn't have
disgraced Verdi's Manrico. Too beefy by half, but beef gradually gave way to
rarer meats and operas with two Rossini arias written for the formidable
Naples tenor Andrea Nozzari. Thomas Muraco dealt ably with the piano
accompaniments.

If you find it is not so much the politics which are hard to take in this
election campaign but the politicians, you may want to watch World In Action
(8.30 ITV). It will look not at politicians but at electors: some of those
in Hampstead and Highgate who have avoided being listed on the electoral
register because they have not paid their poll tax, and others in South
Africa who will be voting even though they left Britain nearly 20 years ago.
Which outfit runs the toughest test in the British armed forces? That's
right, whichever is the subject of this week's documentary. Today it is the
'All Arms Course' run by the Parachute Regiment, according to Cutting Edge
(9.00 C4).
Best drama adaptation so far this year, and quite likely to remain so, is
BBC2's The Old Devils which has splendid ensemble acting from a marvellous
cast including Bernard Hepton, Elizabeth Spriggs, and John Stride (9.30
BBC2). Northern Exposure is described as a 'cult American comedy drama
series' which means they don't expect most of us to like it. Having watched
the slow and not very funny opening episode I am not surprised.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Arts: New York City Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It seldom happens that people realise that they are living through a Golden
Age, but in New York there are many who did just that. That age, it is now
plain, lasted from 1948, when George Balanchine and Lincoln Kirstein founded
New York City Ballet, till 1983, when Balanchine died.
But the vitality of this extraordinary company was directly related to Mr B.
himself, to his vigilance in the wings every night and to his tuition in the
classroom every morning. 'What are you saving it for?' he never ceased to
ask his dancers. He wanted more energy, more stretch, less acting, more
clarity, more daring, more musicality.
NYCB still dances most of Balanchine's ballets, and they are still the
greatest works ever choreographed. The dancers present feats of technique
and speed that any other ballet company in the world might envy. But the
bodies are not radiant as they used to be, and neither are the steps.
Watching a Balanchine ballet danced now by what was once his company can be
like walking round a great old cathedral in winter with no light. Yes, this
would indeed be one of the shining achievements of the human spirit, if only
it would shine - if only we could see it.
Of the eight Balanchine ballets I saw NYCB dance in February, I felt this
most painfully in Divertimento no 15. This has been the most ineffable of
all ballets. Somewhere in my head I will always carry, like iridescent
bubbles, images from the Allegro theme-and-variations sequence of solos in
this celestial Mozart ballet as they used to be danced: images of beauty and
brilliance that truly enshrined a sublime moral vision. Calling ideally for
five ballerinas and three male classicists, it is now both gravely undercast
and underdanced. In the two performances I saw, only Nichol Hlinka, in the
first variation, had something of the right high-density fullness. Judith
Fugate, a soloist at heart and at best, was lost in the diamantine dances
for the prima. And a ballet that used to be, even in inferior performances,
a shimmering construction of noble idealism, musical wit and gossamer
delicacy had shrunk to become a nice little posy of pretty dances for some
good girls and their partners.
During Balanchine's lifetime, any talk of New York City ballet involved talk
of Mr B's favourites. (He married four of his ballerinas and was in love
with several others.) )This is one NYCB tradition that continues strong.
Gossip and serious criticism have focused on the women in the life of his
successor, the Danish-born Peter Martins. Heather Watts, his first and
longest-lasting American girlfriend, is still featured in a dismayingly
large sector of repertory. I wrote here about this two years ago; suffice it
to say that that her inadequate technique and over-interpretation are such
that I, like many New Yorkers, now avoid those ballets in which she is cast.
RecentlyMartins married Darci Kistler, the last baby ballerina to have been
nurtured by Balanchine and a beloved source of light on the State Theater
stage; and she is the ballerina of Martins's new post-modern post-Mozart
ballet, Delight of the Muses, set to a commissioned score that composer
Charles Wuorinen has based on two Mozart sonatas and stage music from Don
Giovanni. The use Martins makes of Kistler is as curious and as dispiriting
as the use he has made of Balanchine, whose precedent seems, as ever, to
have been buzzing in Martins's head. Whereas Balanchine would often ask a
male dancer to partner more ballerinas than one, here Martins has Kistler
partnered by two men - Jock Soto and his own son (her stepson) Nilas
Martins.
For 'partnered,' read 'pestered.' They won't leave her alone, and they are
forever invading her space. She is forever hedged in, her path blocked, her
sky clouded. The mood is meant to be jokey, and Kistler smiles sweetly
through everything. But it is a sorry spectacle; the aftertaste is sour.
Wuorinen's orchestration and rejigging of Mozart has much the same cramped,
clever, mean spirit as Martins's adaptation of the high-classical
Balanchine-baroque model (in particular, the style of Divertimento no 15,
which, for Delight's first two performances Martins featured on the same
programme).
One's view of City Ballet is not helped by the fact that Kistler, whose
career has been bedevilled by injury, has been dancing way beneath her old
form. (She is still under 30.) I saw her also in Balanchine's Duo Concertant
and Mozartiana. Her never-failing musicality always helps her to reveal the
shape and spirit of a role; and in both there were moments of of the most
radiant purity. There were also, however, numerous smudges and blurs.
It was more satisfying to watch Kyra Nichols, who is still in her mid-30s
the most lucid classicist in the world. I have seen this dancer, again and
again in the past ten years and more, make time stop. Suddenly, amid one of
her prodigious feats of speed or aplomb, she will make a step stop, slow
down or just beam forth with redoubled brightness. These moments are not to
be predicted, but when they occur - as, this February, in Balanchine's
Tchaikovsky pas de deux - they are always amazing. Yet she is still a
glorious dancer in ballets that give her no such opportunities. She now
dances the role that in 1980 Balanchine made on Karin von Aroldingen in
Robert Schumann's 'Davidsbundlertanze'; her lyric grace (an improvement, I
find, on von Aroldingen's eloquent but heavier, more acted and less danced
account) illumined the ballet anew, like the white Northern light on the
ballet's backdrop. I have never seen Jerome Robbins's Afternoon of a Faun
danced with greater simplicity; and she was even more breathtaking in his
Dances at a Gathering.
NYCB has other fine dancers too. I have for some seasons delighted in Damien
Woetzel (who often partners Nichols), and now I am also happy to have
discovered young Ethan Stiefel. Nichol Hlinka, mentioned above, is a
welcomely individual dancer, audacious and dark-glowing. There are dancers
in the corps to keep Balanchine's picture of youth and harmony in Le Tombeau
de Couperin alive. But NYCB's huge repertory needs considerably more
strength than this at every level. Every noble deed by Nichols in Robert
Schumann is countered by cheap ones from Valentina Kozlova (in Suzanne
Farrell's old role) and Heather Watts. Talented dancers such as Peter Boal
are too often subdued. Perky soloists like Margaret Tracey or eccentric
workhorses such as Wendy Wehelan have been promoted beyond their potential.
Balanchine choreography at its greatest is like nothing else in all of life:
it affects one's hearing and sight so profoundly that its use of music and
dancers becomes a drama of time and space. Many Balanchine ballets will, I
suppose, survive. Other companies dance some of them well; and the School of
American Ballet, which feeds New York City Ballet with a supply of
exceptional dancers, is still a treasury of Balanchine stylistic wisdom. But
New York City Ballet is uniquely placed to honour the work of this supreme
artist.
Next year NYCB will honour its founder-choreographer with a Balanchine
Festival. One wishes it was honouring him better in its day-by-day activity
now.

FT  23 MAR 92 / People: Street wisdom in insurance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Brian Street, one of the UK insurance industry's leading experts on
pollution, is changing jobs.
A chartered accountant who has worked in insurance for over 30 years, Street
developed new products in such exotic areas as 'malicious tamper' during his
eight years with American International Group, before turning his attention
to environmental matters in 1988.
Now, at 54, he is to become director of operations of a new UK venture by
ECS Underwriting which acts as an agent for another leading US player,
Reliance National.
ECS is well known in the US for providing environmental liability insurance
products and services and will now seek to expand its market into Europe.
An advocate of a more scientific approach to underwriting, Street is highly
critical of the approach to pollution adopted by many UK insurers which
could eventually leave them with large losses.
Indeed, with European environmental law increasingly influenced by legal
principles common in the US - such as the 'polluter pays' - Street expects
pollution to become a big issue for insurers and policyholders alike in the
1990s.

FT  23 MAR 92 / People: NatWest looks for 'material impact'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
National Westminster Bank may not be able to do much right at the moment but
at least it intends to buy right. Britain's second biggest clearing bank has
hired Stuart Humby from PowerGen to be its first director of group
purchasing.
Humby, 50, and a past president of the Institute of Purchasing and Supply,
will be responsible for managing NatWest's Pounds 2bn annual spending on
goods and services. He is one of a new breed of professional managers which
regards the purchasing function as an 'important competitive weapon'.
'The difference between looking after purchasing in a ham-fisted way and
doing it to the ultimate professional standard could be as much as 25 per
cent of the cost,' says Humby, who has degrees in mechanical engineering and
business studies. This appointment is believed to be the first time a
clearing bank has hired someone of Humby's seniority and Bert Morris, a
deputy chief executive of NatWest, expects that the initiative will have a
'material impact' on the group's performance.
Traditionally, the big clearing banks have been slower than has industry in
getting a grip on their costs and although NatWest's record in this area is
not as bad as some, Humby believes that it has not taken the purchasing
function as seriously as have companies like British Airways, Glaxo and
SmithKline Beecham.
Although he will be building his new operation at NatWest 'almost from
scratch' he does not envisage having more than half a dozen people in the
central operation. 'One of the gravest mistakes in purchasing is to set up a
large central organisation,' says Humby.
He started work as an engineering apprentice at Cummins, and after spells at
Krupp and ICI Fibres, he joined British Coal where he was deputy director
general of supply and contracts and oversaw an annual budget of Pounds
1.6bn. In terms of annual spending his new job at NatWest will be roughly
four times as big as his previous post at PowerGen and it will also be less
orientated towards engineering and more towards buying of services.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Management: Going to work on ageism / A report on plans to
end discrimination
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After sexism and racism, the next '-ism' to be tackled by
anti-discrimination legislation could be ageism. One pledge to have gone
largely unnoticed during the past few days of manifesto madness is Labour's
plan to examine the feasibility of just such a law.
Employers could be banned from specifying an age for a particular post in a
newspaper advertisement, in the same way that it would be illegal now for
them to say they wanted to employ only a white person or a man.
According to Brook Street, the employment agency, age discrimination does
not start at 55. Says Anita Higginson, marketing and training director: 'If
you're a judge it's OK to be over 70 and go on until you drop dead; if
you're looking for a first secretarial job you could be finished by 25'.
Associating particular jobs with particular ages is commonly an unthinking
reflex on the part of employers, says Higginson. For example, the popular
perception is that the chairman of a company - or, at the opposite end of
the scale, a cleaner - will be over 50. According to a survey of 1,000
personnel directors conducted by Gallup for Brook Street, more than 60 per
cent thought receptionists should be under 35.
The same survey revealed that nearly 80 per cent of workers over 50 believed
they had been refused a job because they were too old, even though they had
the relevant skills.
Some organisations have made a virtue out of breaking the stereotypes as
they have struggled, particularly before the recession, to plug labour and
skill gaps. B&amp;Q, the DIY chain, for example, has stores staffed entirely by
men and women over 50 and has proclaimed the policy an unqualified success.
Research by the World Health Organisation into Tesco's employees has found
that older workers employed by the company are better with customers, more
reliable, more responsible and less likely to take time off sick than their
younger colleagues.
The Gallup survey for Brook Street was carried out two years ago and there
are some signs that attitudes among employers are beginning to change. A
recent survey, by Alan Walker and Philip Taylor from the University of
Sheffield, suggests, surprisingly, that employers could now even favour
outlawing age discrimination.
The survey of 500 employers, funded by the Economic and Social Research
Council, found 55 per cent in favour of a law along the lines of the sex and
race discrimination acts.
Some deep-rooted reservations about taking on older workers remain: the
survey also found that employers feared they would not get a reasonable
return on the money they spent on training older workers.
This finding is important for policy makers, given that three out of four
respondents to the survey perceived a lack of appropriate skills as the top
reason for not taking on older workers. Government policies on training
have, to date, been strongly biased in favour of younger workers.
In spite of the Sheffield findings, Labour is likely to face strong
opposition from employers' bodies to any plans for legislation. The
Confederation of British Industry favours a voluntary approach and argues
that there could be circumstances where it might be sensible for employers
to specify age when, for example a post requires a particular level of
experience.
Labour's argument is that employers have had plenty of time to reform.
Guidelines from the Institute of Personnel Management, which have been in
circulation for some time, strongly urge organisations not to specify ages
in advertisements.
The Sheffield survey found that nearly half of employers had not seen the
IPM guidelines although, 'in some cases, the guidelines had been copied
enthusiastically to all departments in an organisation'.
If much age discrimination is based on an unthinking reflex, the Sheffield
finding indicates that - considerable progress could be achieved simply by
increased education of employers.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Management: Regimental ties in Civvy Street / A look at
officers becoming city gents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MILLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Business metaphors such as 'takeover battle' and 'dawn raid' are coming into
their own as officers leaving Britain's armed forces seek new careers in
management and finance.
This year, the Army is shedding 850 officers in the first tranche of the
Options for Change forces cut-back programme, and over the following two
years a further 1,500 or so will go. Smaller numbers - not yet announced -
will leave the Royal Navy and RAF.
The Ministry of Defence is helping ease the transition of soldiers, sailors
and airmen into the civilian sectors with special courses on subjects like
business management.
Private sector consultancies are starting to get in on the act. Coutts
Career Consultants has been awarded an MoD contract to counsel departing
personnel.
It will be starting workshops in Germany and in the garrisons of Aldershot,
Hampshire, and Catterick, North Yorkshire from April 1.
Right Associates, the outplacement group which runs job assistance centres
for the US Army, is offering free advice on second careers to a senior
officer from each of the three British services as a promotional gambit.
The idea is that the officers will give the agency tips on how to tailor its
advice, and will also recommend it to fellow officers.
David Burden, director-general, resettlement, at the MoD, says 60 per cent
those leaving the forces voluntarily or through redundancy get other jobs
immediately.
They go into banking, education, engineering, the National Health Service -
indeed to every civilian sector. At the end of six months, the success rate
is 85 per cent.
The most obvious selling point for those who have held command in the armed
forces is leadership.
But how well does military leadership operate when it changes to mufti?
Well enough to have persuaded 300 Dutch executives to pay up to FL3,000
(Pounds 925) each in December to hear Norman Schwarzkopf, the Desert Storm
commander, lecture on the lessons of the Gulf war.
Schwarzkopf contended that both military and civilian leaders must have the
courage to make decisions based on insufficient information.
Military training also equips people to respond properly to new data.
'Clever sailors are among the most adaptable of people,' says Michael
Robinson, personnel director for Henderson Administration Group, the City
investment managers.
He left the Royal Navy in 1986 with the rank of commander, having been the
captain of patrol craft in the Far East.
According to Brian Lees, a former head of technical intelligence for the
Army: 'Flexible is the first thing officers must be, because if you can't
change your plan based on new information, you are sunk.'
Lees is now a consultant for Lehman Brothers International, the investment
bank, specialising in joint ventures in the Arab world.
The relevance of his view to business is clear. In an age of 'managing
change', who adapts wins.
Officers are trained to be good at logic, hard intelligence and sorting out
data. But according to Roderick Macdonald, a serving British brigadier, the
best are also aware of when a situation does not 'feel' right.
In the civilian sphere, the ability to be both analytical and intuitive
should help to break the tyranny of experts, he says.
The recommendations of, say, outside management consultants, should be
viewed not as solutions to implement, but as adjuncts to what the executive
knows of his own organisation.
So, will the flexible and intuitive, yet analytical, ex-services person find
a smooth path into management? Not necessarily. There are things the
military does not teach you.
For Joe Ruston, one of these things was how to negotiate with employees over
pay and working conditions.
In the Royal Navy, in which he served for 13 years, 'you never discussed
with a sailor what he was paid, and conditions are laid down in the Queen's
Regulations'.
As chairman of Mander Portman Woodward, a London tutorial college, Ruston
recalls how in 1981 he 'got into a seriously bad mess' over a disagreement
with his staff.
The Inland Revenue had pressed the college to take the teachers, then
self-employed, into the Pay As You Earn income-tax net. After a fight with
the tax-man, the college gave in, only to be faced with two months of
industrial action by unhappy staff.
'I felt betrayed,' says Ruston. 'I'd probably been too paternalistic, but I
had looked after them and now they were giving me a hard time. I think I was
applying a service attitude.
'I hadn't cottoned on to the financial side of man-management. When I wanted
to tighten the screws, I couldn't do it.
'I reacted wrongly and my service training hadn't prepared me for that at
all.' Eventually, the dispute was resolved to the satisfaction of both
sides.
Advance clues about how former military people may react to certain types of
situations could, therefore, be useful - to them and their new
organisations.
Richard Sale, a Cyprus-based staff officer, has attempted to put his finger
on characteristic military qualities by using the techniques of psychometric
testing - the assessment of personality traits according to a fixed set of
criteria.
In a paper for the Royal Military College of Science and Cranfield Institute
of Technology, he collated the responses of 49 brigadiers to computer tests
and questionnaires.
The officers who were tested - 80 per cent of the brigade commanders in the
Army in 1990 - were found, on balance, to be sociable, energetic and
goal-centred individuals who liked solving difficult problems, 'sometimes
ingeniously'.
They were flexible planners, sought variety and change and were consequently
easily bored.
Outgoing in nature, they were confident with new contacts. At the same time,
the subjects' profiles suggested that they could seem domineering to
independent staff and lack tact at times.
Their very ebullience did not fit them for a quiet, low stimulus
environment. And they 'may struggle with a role that demands a high concern
for detail'.
Sale concludes that officers transfer easily to the civilian sector, and
they are particularly well suited for senior executive positions in sales
and marketing.
For all of that, it would be surprising if many job-changers did not
experience a clash of cultures. Some will, for the first time, be working
with women as equals.
Others may need to get used to a less hierarchical management structure in
which the trappings of achievement are harder to discern than they are in
the armed forces.
Unlike Alexander, today's paladin does have new worlds to conquer.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Bradford businesses report first-quarter deterioration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST of this year's chamber of commerce quarterly surveys shows a
worsening of the recession in Bradford, West Yorkshire.
Orders and deliveries have fallen in both domestic and export markets in the
first quarter. Balance figures - the difference between the percentage of
companies reporting rises and those reporting declines - showed sharp
changes of trend.
The balance for home deliveries fell to 5 percentage points from 13 points
in the last quarter of last year, while the balance for home orders went
into reverse - minus 2 points, compared with plus 9 points.
Export deliveries were just positive at 1 percentage point, but this
compared with 19 points in the last survey. Export orders were affected even
more, the balance falling to zero from 19.
The survey covered 202 members of Bradford Chamber of Commerce, spread
mainly in textiles, engineering, chemicals, printing, packaging,
construction and freight forwarding. They employ more 16,000 people between
them.
Although 59 per cent managed to keep all their workforce employed, 20 per
cent shed labour and 21 per cent took more people on. Fourteen per cent plan
to shed staff in the second quarter and only 10 per cent to recruit.
However, 41 per cent tried to recruit, which suggests that about half could
not find the right people. The biggest shortage was in professional and
managerial staff, where 43 per cent of prospective recruiters had problems,
followed by skilled manual workers, where 28 per cent were affected.
There was little difficulty in filling clerical, unskilled and part-time
jobs.
A national drive to widen the membership of Britain's chambers of commerce
is being launched today in a direct mail campaign aimed at 80,000
businesses.
About 90,000 businesses are already affiliated members of the Association of
British Chambers of Commerce. The association hopes to increase that to
150,000 by 1994.
The campaign is sponsored by National Westminster Bank.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Vice-chairman to succeed Hayden as head of Jaguar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BILL HAYDEN, chairman and chief executive of Jaguar, the heavily
loss-making luxury car subsidiary of Ford of the US, is to retire at the end
of the month. He will be replaced by Mr Nick Scheele, previously president
of Ford of Mexico, and Jaguar vice-chairman since January 1.
Mr Scheele must implement the ambitious Jaguar new-product plan devised
after Ford's Pounds 1.6bn takeover at the end of 1989. The plan is aimed at
boosting production by the end of the decade to more than 100,000 cars a
year, four times last year's depressed level.
The product programme, which is expected to involve a capital investment of
more than Pounds 1bn through the 1990s, will focus on the development of
three new model ranges as well as the development of a new engine family.
Jaguar's plans for the 1990s include:
A revised version of its XJ6 saloon, code-named the X300, to be launched in
1994.
A replacement for the XJS coupe and convertible ranges, code-named X100, to
be launched in 1996.
The launch of a new engine family, first as a V8 - code-named AJ26 - in 1996
but later in V6 form and possibly as a V12. The company is expected to
decide later this year whether it will be made at one of its own Midlands
sites or built at a Ford engine plant.
The launch, probably in 1998, of a smaller sporty saloon, code-named the
X200, to compete with rivals such as the BMW 5-Series. Jaguar hopes that
this will enable it to more than double annual production from between
50,000 and 70,000 for the other car ranges to between 100,000 and 150,000.
Mr Scheele said the 'key challenge' facing Jaguar was to deliver the product
programme on time and within budget.
The company was still 'grappling' with the issue of the degree to which
Jaguar should use common components with Ford. He said Lexus, the Japanese
luxury car range, shared many components with Toyota.
He said Jaguar planned to raise production this year to 27,500, but 'that
assumes a recovery in the second half of the year, and at the moment the
signs are not good'.
According to Mr Hayden Jaguar's break-even point has been reduced to about
34,000 cars a year.
Mr Scheele said the company was seeking to improve productivity by about 25
per cent this year after a gain of 23 per cent in 1991. 'We have got to take
another 40 per cent out of our hours per car.'
The company is also planning to reduce its workforce by about 10 per cent or
some 800 jobs this year, after cutting employment drastically by a third in
1991 to 8,015 from 12,100 at the end of 1990.
The company has become alarmed by the fall in owner loyalty in the US, from
a traditional level of around 70 per cent to only 30 per cent last year,
said Mr Scheele.
Jaguar hopes this trend can be reversed by its progress in overcoming
earlier quality problems. Mr Scheele said quality had shown a six-fold
improvement in the past two years.
Jaguar, in loss for the past three years, suffered a record deficit of
Pounds 226m last year.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Labour considers uniting public-sector pay bodies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR leaders are giving serious consideration to transforming the way in
which public-sector pay is determined and, if elected, may establish a
permanent public-service pay advisory commission to decide pay awards.
They have also indicated that they would not abandon the current attempt to
introduce performance-related pay for 500,000 civil servants and believe
that the Civil Service unions, which are sceptical about the current plans,
would co-operate with a 'sensible' system of performance pay.
There is less enthusiasm from senior Labour officials for devolving pay in
the public sector to a more local level, something which is just starting in
the National Health Service and local government.
The public-service pay advisory commission, which would be fully independent
of the government, would supercede the existing pay review bodies which fix
pay for nearly half of the 4m to 5m public-sector employees.
Labour is committed to keeping the existing pay review bodies which now
cover, among others, doctors, nurses, teachers and the armed forces. It is
also committed to establishing a new pay-review body for university
lecturers. The commission would bring all the existing pay review bodies
under one roof and develop expertise in comparability with the private
sector - one of the key issues in public-sector pay.
The idea was floated in a 1990 Fabian Society pamphlet by Professor William
Brown and Mr Bob Rowthorn, who suggested that the body's independence could
be ensured by a governing council such as that of the conciliation service
ACAS, with some individuals being nominated by the Confederation of British
Industry and the Trades Union Congress.
A Labour government would not necessarily face immediate pressure on
public-sector pay and there are few unions calling for a return to free
collective bargaining. For those workers covered by pay-review bodies,
public-sector pay has recently been going through of a period of catching up
with the private sector. Potential militancy from unions representing
lower-paid public-sector workers should also be dampened by legislation on
the national minimum wage.
Labour officials believe, however, that the current mix of cash-limited
collective bargaining, pay formulas based on the average earnings index and
pay-review bodies is unsatisfactory and is in danger of creating a
'two-tier' system - with those groups covered by collective bargaining
getting left behind.
Even the pay-review bodies themselves, say the officials, 'produce
incredible disparities'. They are also said to be in an institutional
no-man's land, being neither part of government nor fully independent of it.
One official said: 'We may find in practice that the current mish-mash is
impossible to improve upon but it certainly has severe short-comings that we
want to examine.'
No decisions have yet been taken, but the Labour manifesto commits a Kinnock
government to seek 'fairer and more rational ways of determining
public-sector pay within clearly defined budget limits'.
Deciding who should run a public services pay advisory commission would be a
crucial issue and Labour would not want a repeat of the generous awards made
by the Clegg Commission in 1980.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Gains offset cost of cutting hours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half the cost of the recent cuts in the working week for manual
workers in engineering was absorbed by productivity improvements linked to
the hours reductions, says an academic study published today.
Wage settlements also tended to be lower to help pay for the cut in hours.
Overall, the reductions of two hours, conceded by employers of at least
500,000 manual workers, added less than 1 per cent to the manual labour
costs of the companies which took part in the survey.
That figure shows that employers fell considerably short in their target of
incurring no cost by conceding shorter weeks.
The study, by Mr Ray Richardson and Mr Marcus Rubin of the Centre for
Economic Performance at the London School of Economics, found that a
significant minority of companies, about 10 per cent, did not negotiate
productivity concessions linked to the hours deals.
However, the study found that, for some companies, the two-hour reduction in
the working week led to a fall, or at least no increase, in labour costs.
This was because the negotiations for the reductions became the occasion for
management to bargain hard for changes which improved efficiency.
This tactic was particularly successful where unions were becoming less
resistant to change. Nearly 80 per cent of managers replying to the survey
said the shorter week had resulted in earlier agreement on changes, or
agreement on changes which would otherwise not have been considered at the
time.
Among their conclusions, the authors say that 'however new and miraculous
the 1980s were, a great deal of organisational slack and inefficiency
remained in the UK engineering industry by the end of the decade. The
shorter week campaign was an occasion for a further assault.'

FT  23 MAR 92 / Little benefit to managers in demise of closed shops
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NEAR-disappearance of the closed shop after more than a decade of
Conservative government has produced neither great gains nor losses for
managers, according to a paper prepared for a conference today to be held by
the Centre for Economic Performance Industrial Relations Group.
The report suggests that many closed shops are 'sleeping dogs'. They avoid
legal problems because nobody gets sacked for not belonging to a union, but
in other ways operate much as they did in the past.
A poll commissioned by the Department of Employment in 1989 found that 2.6m
people thought they were still in closed shops. That represented a fall of
50 per cent since the high point of the closed shop at the end of the 1970s.
But, as the report points out, 2.6m is a high figure for an institution that
is meant to be unlawful.
They suggest that the 'real closed shop population' - closed shop agreements
that continue to exist in spite of it being illegal to sack someone for
leaving the union - may be 500,000.
The report concludes that the managerial indifference which marked the rise
of the closed shop in the late 1970s seems also to have attended its demise
in the 1980s.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ready for a dog fight
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neil Kinnock must be quaking. After much thought and many strategic
meetings the Conservatives have devised a cunning plan to foil his evil
designs and stop him from becoming prime minister. They have unleashed the
Dogs of Yore.
Yesterday we had the toothy snarls of Mrs Margaret Thatcher, a pensioner. In
November 1990 her presence was regarded as so damaging to the Tory cause
that she had to be put down. She was wonderful in 1979, but is she right for
1992? We also witnessed another lap in the long-distance run of a sleek if
aging greyhound, Mr Michael Heseltine. He is still well able to stand on his
hind legs, pose as Pointer indicating the Labour quarry, chase the Red Fox,
yowl and growl, and perform wondrous tricks. These may not frighten the
enemy, but they are painful reminders to Conservatives that if he had become
Top Dog Mr Kinnock would have been barked off the premises long ago.
Mr Douglas Hurd is also to be let fly to protect the wallets of us highly
paid folk from Mr Kinnock and his gang of pickpockets. Oh my wallet] Oh my
chequebook] Oh my luxury holiday for two in the villa of my choice] Doomed,
doomed, doomed. Mr Hurd has pedigree, breeding, and good Foreign Office
training. He is a classy canine. But a Dog of War? The nearest young-ish
hound to approach such a definition is Mr Kenneth Clark, a jowly bulldog. He
can be tenacious. Yet for some reason that I cannot quite understand he
frightens floating voters.
That's enough dogs. The truth is that the great Conservative cry that went
up towards the end of last week was a yelp of despair. The call was for a
tougher brand of rhetoric. To achieve this the party's more forceful
speakers were to be asked to speak forcefully. The underlying, hardly
spoken, meaning was that Tories were losing confidence in the effectiveness
of Mr John Major.
I am not so sure. His quiet, patient decency - or his new 'tough' manner -
may yet come through, if slowly. The question is, will it make any
difference? If Mr Major loses this election it will be because of wrong
strategic choices he made in November 1990, when he decided not to risk an
immediate contest, and again on several occasions last year, when he missed
further auspicious dates. He let his good chances go because, as a man made
by the Treasury, he placed his faith in the Treasury and its forecast of
better times this spring. If he is now broken, it will be by the Treasury's
hand.
This is not to say that the prime minister is a strong campaigner. He
suffered piteously under the vicious onslaught of Mr Brian Walden on London
Weekend Television yesterday. Mr Walden hit him where it hurts most - in his
carefully cultivated, and sincerely based, 'caring' image. The interview put
Mr Major on the defensive, and kept him there. He defended himself, with
good words but poor body-language, against the charge that voters 'don't
trust you on the . . . National Health Service . . . '. He recoiled from the
assertion that people want all the fruits of growth to go to public
services, and none of it to tax cuts. He was obliged to review the
unfortunate remark of Mr Norman Lamont that rising unemployment and the
recession were a 'price well worth paying' to get inflation down.
Mr Walden's techniques are well-known. Mr Major should have been coached in
counter-offensive tactics; he might have got in some positive statements
about his own party and some negative ones about the opposition. He was too
polite. The Walden steamroller flattened him. It was unfair, but if you want
to lead a great party to victory you must know how to overcome unfairness.
The opposition's superstar, Mr John Smith, is a master of this art.
Interviewed more softly by Mr Jonathan Dimbleby on the BBC than was Mr Major
by Mr Walden, the shadow chancellor easily maintained his dazzling
performance of the previous week. The principal charge against him - that
Labour was not as serious as are the Tories about bringing down inflation -
was answered in words that fall to pieces when the cold text is
deconstructed, but that stood up well as part of his powerful television
image. He easily brushed aside a silly intimation by Mr Roy Hattersley - not
one of Labour's assets - that the top rate of income tax might be raised
even further than Mr Smith's 50 per cent. He was grateful to Roy for trying
to give him a little flexibility, but 50 per cent it was, said Mr Smith.
Then the St Bernard of the Labour party continued his rounds.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Candidate finds electorate 'switching off'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
BIRMINGHAM, HALL GREEN
Conservative majority 7,621
Labour requires 8.4% swing to win.
46% of voters are middle class, 13% managerial/professional.
THE CONSERVATIVE offensive against Labour tax policies has been, in the case
of Birmingham Hall Green, rather like firing cannonballs into the desert.
The sand pays little attention.
Even Mr Andrew Hargreaves, seeking to retain the seat for the Conservatives,
would go no further than saying that 'the issue is there lurking in the
background'. At the moment, 'everything is a switch-off', he added. 'The
problem is getting the electors to focus.'
This makes the issue easier for Labour to handle, but Ms Jane Slowey, the
party's Hall Green candidate, observed that the tax issue comes and goes:
'It's not the issue it was four or five weeks ago.'
Mr David McGrath, the Liberal Democrat candidate, noted that the two main
issues in the constituency were the recession on one hand and law and order
on the other.
Hall Green has its own political agenda running parallel with the national
debate. This is a reflection of the local party balance and of the nature of
the constituency. Mr Hargreaves polled 44.9 per cent of the vote in the 1987
election. But, between them, Labour with 28 per cent and the Alliance with
27 per cent gained more votes.
'Andrew Hargreaves has a political rather than a personal following,' said
Mr Carl Chinn, the Birmingham University community historian, who lives in
the constituency. This implies that his political future depends not only on
how the anti-Conservative vote splits but also on the degree of success the
Tories have in conveying their national message.
This is a constituency of the middle classes, but not of the the best-off.
It is a constituency of upwardly mobile skilled workers who have tended
towards the Conservatives, but with a strong sprinkling of Irish people, who
are traditionally Labour voters.
While in Billesley and Brandwood there is a 50-50 split between
owner-occupied and council housing, in the Hall Green ward owner-occupation
jumps to about 80 per cent.
Unemployment levels have consistently been beneath the city average, but
have been rising.
'In any Birmingham constituency worry about cars is more crucial than tax,'
said Mr Chinn, reflecting the west Midlands preoccupation with the future of
the motor industry.
The tax issue comes forward indirectly. Concern seems to focus less on tax
levels as on obtaining the best value for each pound paid in tax.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Catholic church rounds on Moi

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S Catholic bishops yesterday delivered an unprecedented attack on the
government of President Daniel arap Moi, blaming it for the recent spate of
violence in which more than 60 people have died.
The criticism, in a pastoral letter read to congregations throughout Kenya,
reflects growing political unease, accompanied by doubts about Mr Moi's
commitment to a multi-party system. Last November western donors made new
aid to Kenya conditional on economic and political reforms.
Last Friday the government responded to the fighting by banning political
meetings. Opposition leaders claim that the government instigated the
clashes, seeking a pretext for a clampdown on dissent and postponement of
multi-party elections.
In their letter, the bishops dismiss claims that fighting in western Kenya,
mainly between Mr Moi's minority Kalenjin tribe and Luo and Luhya ethnic
groups, has been caused by land disputes or tribal rivalries.
Nor do they accept the government's suggestions that the conflict is a
result of last December's decision to lift the ban on multi-party politics.
Instead the bishops suggest that the conflict 'is all part of a wider
political strategy' involving 'well-trained arsonists and bandits' who have
been 'transported to the scenes of crime from outside the area'. The letter
adds: 'There has been no impartiality on the part of the security forces. On
the contrary, their attitude seems to imply that orders from above were
given in order to inflict injuries only on particular ethnic groups.
'It is difficult for the government to exonerate itself from the
responsibility of these violent clashes.'
The letter also criticises 'high-ranking politicians, declaring certain
zones to be exclusively for the (ruling) Kanu party'. The result is that
people have been 'forced out of their schools, jobs, houses, and even from
their land'.
The bishops express concern about the 'lack of impartiality' in radio and
television coverage, and condemn civil servants who refuse to license
opposition meetings.
There was no immediate government response to the letter, but President Moi,
addressing a meeting yesterday in Chebilat, north-western Kenya, said that
the government was concerned by the violence.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Hong Kong's securities regulator to resign
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chairman of Hong Kong's stock market regulatory body, Mr Robert Owen, is
to resign. The former merchant banker and diplomat who was brought in to set
up the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC) in 1988 will leave on May 1,
the third anniversary of the SFC's inauguration.
His departure coincides with a new phase for the Commission. After three
years of forceful action the SFC has established itself as the watchdog of a
stock exchange with a reformed governing council no longer controlled by
vested interests.
Mr Owen will be replaced by deputy chairman Mr Robert Nottle, one of the
five original executive directors and a former senior operations director of
Australia's National Companies and Securities Commission.
Three other original directors will remain, with Mr Ermanno Pascutto
becoming deputy chairman. Director of enforcement Mr Gavin Eadie is to be
replaced by the commission's legal counsel, Mr Gerard McMahon, while another
internal promotion will see Mr Michael Wu becoming the first local Chinese
member of the executive.
Mr Owen said there was sufficient continuity within the SFC to ensure there
would be no negative impact from his departure.
'The Commission is an accepted part of the scenery here. People understand
what it is all about and it gets on with its job,' said Mr Owen. But this
involved a struggle in a community where a laissez-faire ethos has long
prevailed.
The SFC has survived vocal attacks from legislative councillors and
prominent businessmen and put into effect the recommendations of Mr Ian Hay
Davison in his critical 1988 review of Hong Kong's financial markets. The
SFC went beyond the Davison recommendations in undertaking a thorough reform
of the Stock Exchange's ruling council.
'In terms of the international perception, I think it is fair to say that
the 1987 cloud has now been well and truly dispersed,' said Mr Owen.
International confidence in the exchange was shattered after its temporary
closure by the chairman, Mr Ronald Li, in the wake of the October 1987
crash. Mr Li was subsequently jailed for corruption.
Mr Davison had said 'an inside group treated the exchange as a private club
rather than a public utility for the general benefit of members, investors
and issuers'. Under the SFC reforms, the exchange's council was broadened in
order to block the influence of vested interest groups.
There has also been a large degree of ethnic tension in the dispute, with
the expatriate SFC seen as an outside aggressor which did not understand the
local market. Moves will be taken to redress the racial balance of the
commission, with Mr Nottle's eventual successor likely to be a local
Chinese.
Mr Owen said the future direction of the SFC would be towards market
development and also towards moves to protect Hong Kong's long-oppressed
minority shareholders.
'I saw myself coming here to establish an organisation, implement the
reforms and see them established with a reasonable degree of continuity. In
that sense, the timing has worked out very well,' he said.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Japanese outcry at gun attack
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN ATTEMPT to shoot a top politician has shaken the Japanese authorities out
of their complacency about security just months before a nationwide election
campaign, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
A young ultra-rightist infiltrated a provincial meeting of the ruling
Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) on Friday and fired three shots at the
powerful party vice-president, Mr Shin Kanemaru.
No-one was hurt, but one bullet flew close to Mr Kanemaru's head. 'I thought
wind or an insect was passing by me,' the 77-year-old politician said
afterwards.
The shooting in Ashikaga, north of Tokyo, has provoked an outcry in Japan,
with calls to tighten security around public figures because of the
increasing use of firearms.
Embarrassed police said that, despite past right-wing threats to Mr
Kanemaru, they were not prepared for a gun attack. All their preparation had
been aimed at foiling assaults by swords or knives.
'We were caught in a blind spot,' said the national police chief, Mr Ryoichi
Suzuki.
Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, and other government and LDP
leaders, including Mr Kanemaru, had been expected to criss-cross the country
in the next few months to try to restore their waning political fortunes
before elections in late July to replace half of the upper house of
parliament.
Mr Miyazawa's popularity rating after less than five months in office is
languishing at around 20 per cent, amid a series of bribery scandals.
Mr Tamisuke Watanuki, the LDP secretary-general, said the party would have
to reconsider senior officials' travel plans because police could not
guarantee total security.
The 24-year-old man arrested after the attack on Mr Kanemaru is a member of
a tiny group called Yukoku Seiwa-kai, Patriotic Association for Harmony and
Justice. On Saturday, police raided its Tokyo office.
Japan's fragmented and relatively small extreme right - about 980 groups
with total membership of over 120,000 - is strong on symbolic though noisy
protests.
The ultra-rightists' main charge against Mr Kanemaru is that he has taken
the lead in trying to normalise Japan's long-frozen ties with North Korea.

<TEXT>
POLITICIANS sympathetic to the armed forces won about half the seats in the
lower house of parliament in Thailand's general election yesterday, a
qualified victory which suggests they could form a coalition government this
week if they can agree on a prime minister.
Thailand's return to democracy after its 18th coup d'etat in February last
year has been characteristically hesitant, and the election campaign was
marred by widespread vote-buying and the killings of several canvassers.
Political parties often lack coherent policies and buy members of parliament
from each other for lucrative transfer fees, and few Thais were surprised
when unofficial results showed that the brand new Samakki Tham (Justice
Unity) Party had come out on top with about 78 seats in the 360-seat elected
chamber.
Samakki Tham was created by senior military officers after last year's coup
to ensure a continued role for the armed forces in politics, and its leaders
were already negotiating with other pro-military parties last night in an
attempt to form a coalition.
Although the pro-military politicians did well in the poorer, northern parts
of Thailand where vote-buying is routine, parties opposing military
intervention in politics were successful in Bangkok and in the
politically-aware southern half of the country.
Mr Chamlong Srimuang, the former mayor of Bangkok and leader of the Phalang
Dharma (Power of Buddhist Teaching) party who campaigned as 'Mr Clean', won
an estimated 32 of the 35 seats in the capital and surprised even his
supporters by winning about a dozen more seats elsewhere.
After staging the coup, the military junta gave the pro-military parties a
built-in advantage by devising a controversial new constitution which allows
the 270-seat Senate to vote with the lower house in no confidence debates.
Yesterday Gen Sunthorn Kongsompong, the junta's chairman, appointed a Senate
of which more than half the members were officers of the armed forces and
the police.
Debate last night was focusing on the identity of the prime minister to
replace the outgoing Mr Anand Panyarachun, the military appointee who won
the support of the business community for a series of economic reforms
during his one-year tenure. Political liberals and student activists are
demanding that the new premier be an elected member of parliament, while the
military commanders say they have the right to choose anyone they want.
Officials of PollWatch, a new watchdog established by Mr Anand, agreed that
vote-buying was still widespread in yesterday's election but claimed that
PollWatch's existence and the presence of more than 31,000 volunteers at
poll booths yesterday had to some extent deterred corrupt politicians.
Independent observers said campaigners had been more subtle about the way
they bribed and coerced voters, in some cases buying noodle shops and
brothels for a week at a time and providing free meals and prostitutes to
curry favour with local residents.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Chinese deficit may curb plans for growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BEIJING
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA recorded its biggest budget deficit last year, which puts severe
financial restraints on its capacity to fund the rapid economic development
called for by elder statesman Deng Xiaoping.
In a budget statement to China's annual parliament, the National People's
Congress, at the weekend, the finance minister reported an unprecedented
deficit of 21.11bn yuan (Pounds 2.8bn), 8.76bn yuan over the planned figure.
The minister, Wang Bingqiang, blamed the deficit increase on a combination
of factors, including last year's devastating floods, which led to a fall in
revenues and a 10bn yuan disaster relief bill.
Support for loss-making state enterprises was a drain, costing the central
budget more than 50bn yuan in subsidies. An additional 37bn yuan went in
compensation for price increases which are aimed at bringing grain and oil
prices more in line with the market.
Wang spoke of China's 'financial difficulties' reflecting deep structural
problems in the economy. He blamed 'poor economic performance, the
irrational pattern of distribution of income, overstaffing in government
organs and the burden of subsidies.'
Budgetary constraints will make it difficult to fund the infrastructure
needed for high speed development. They could also delay the start of
construction of the 57bn yuan Three Gorges dam on the Yangtze.
Forecasts for 1992 show a budget shortfall only marginally less than in
1991. Wang said fulfilling the targets for 1992 would be an uphill climb. A
supporter of Chen Yun, who leads the conservative opponents of the Deng
Xiaoping rapid development line, Mr Wang called for financial discipline and
strict control over expenditure.
The only exceptions to the belt-tightening are military expenditure, up 12
per cent to 37bn yuan, and education, up just over 11 per cent.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Iranian oil monopoly faces break-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NATIONAL Iranian Oil Company (NIOC), the state oil group, is to lose its
monopoly over the country's oil industry after a critical internal review
conducted by President Hashemi Rafsanjani, according to a reliable industry
newsletter published today.
Iran's eight refineries are to be spun off as separate commercial units from
NIOC, leaving the latter to concentrate on oil exploration, production and
marketing, an article in Petroleum Argus says.
The report also suggests that the future of Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh as oil
minister has been thrown into some doubt and will remain so until after
Iran's elections on April 10.
The internal review into NIOC, which has held a monopoly over all Iran's oil
operations since 1973, followed strong criticism of the state company late
last year for failing to meet domestic demand for kerosine. The company has
also been criticised for not maximising foreign exchange revenues from crude
export sales and for failing to hedge properly against last year's volatile
oil prices.
The article highlights a costly policy of placing 40m barrels of its 2.4m
b/d crude oil exports into floating storage last year, which twice helped
push down the value of Iranian crude while accruing heavy charges for the
storage vessels.
Petroleum Argus estimates that 'setbacks in crude marketing' last year cost
Iran Dollars 3bn (Pounds 1.7bn) - a quarter of the average annual income
generated by NIOC, itself 90 per cent of the country's foreign exchange
earnings.
The decision to break up NIOC control over refining will open the way for
private Iranian companies to take a bigger role in the country's petroleum
products export business.
However, the article says that NIOC will regain control of the National
Iranian Offshore Company and National Iranian Tanker Company.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Finland's central bank comes to the rescue: The country's
banks are reeling from the effects of the recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND'S banks are reeling from the worst economic blow in recent history.
Faced with heavy credit losses and debtors who have halted the interest
payments on their loans, many of the Finnish banks reported large losses for
1991 and expect this year to be just as bad.
However, a godsend came last week in the form of a Bank of Finland proposal
for a rescue package.
This is aimed at bolstering the banks' capital adequacy ratios, improving
their profitability, and restoring confidence in the troubled sector by
setting up a FM20bn (Pounds 2.54bn) government deposit guarantee fund.
Finland's financial markets flourished in the deregulated environment of the
mid-to-late 1980s. However, the Finnish economy is now suffering from a
severe recession: GNP fell by 6 per cent in 1991, unemployment has reached
10 per cent, and the number of bankruptcies soared by 70 per cent to a
record 6,138 last year.
The sharp downturn in the Finnish economy has taken its toll on the banks,
leading to a dramatic increase in non-performing loans (where no interest
has been paid for 90 days or more) and credit losses. Total credit losses
for the Finnish banks jumped from FM2.34bn in 1990 to FM7.59bn last year,
raising fears about the ability of the banks to meet the international
capital adequacy requirements in future.
The Basle accord on international bank capital adequacy sets a minimum
capital-to-assets ratio of 8 per cent which must be met by the end of 1992.
Of the 8 per cent total capital requirement, at least half must be core, or
Tier One, capital (consisting of common equity, perpetual preference shares
and retained earnings), while the rest can be non-core, or Tier Two, capital
(consisting of subordinated debt instruments, reserves and general
provisions.)
'Finnish banks on average met the capital adequacy requirements fairly
comfortably (at the end of 1991),' said Finland's working group on banking
conditions last week.
'However, there were big differences between banks, and at current balance
sheet levels, this year's losses threaten to bring the total banking
sector's capital ratio down to close to the 8 per cent minimum or in the
worst cases even below it.'
To meet the 8 per cent capital adequacy requirement banks would either have
to raise new capital or cut their loans - a move which would have serious
consequences for the economy.
The Bank of Finland announced that the government would make up to FM8bn
available to invest in banks' core (Tier One) capital. The result would be
to improve the banks' lending capacity by between FM90bn and FM110bn (or
about 25 per cent of the stock of loans).
'It is quite possible that the banks may not need to draw on this capital at
all, but the point is that at least it is there to avoid a credit crunch,'
says Mr Jyrki Laakso, head of the international department at the Finnish
Bankers' Association, who sees this measure as an important precaution.
To help banks further, the central bank said it would take steps to improve
the banks' meagre interest rate margins by raising the base rate by one
percentage point to 9.5 per cent on May 1, and increasing the rates on
low-interest loans.
It has been a sore point for Finnish banks that over half of their loans are
tied to the base rate (which has remained at 8.5 per cent since late 1989)
while their lending is funded at a much higher rate in the money market,
where three-month Helibor rates shot up to nearly 15 per cent in 1991 and
are now around 12.3 per cent.
Traditionally bankers' pleas for a higher base rate have met with stony
resistance from the parliamentary supervisory board of the central bank
which is responsible for base rate decisions.
The politicians who sit on the board have been unwilling to raise the rate
because of the impact on individuals with mortgages and personal loans.
However, while the board was sharply divided on last week's decision to
raise rates, Mr Rolf Kullberg, Bank of Finland governor, said he wanted to
see the base rate increased still further to reduce the gap between credits
tied to the base rate and those tied to market rates.
Bankers believe that as market rates fall and approach the base rate, it
will become easier to abandon the base rate altogether as a marker to loans.

MORE United Nations peacekeepers arrived at the weekend to take up positions
in war-torn regions of Croatia amid renewed fighting between Serbs and
Croats.
Croatian and Serbian news media reported fighting in eastern and central
Croatia and Dubrovnik, the Adriatic port. Each side accused the other of
violating the ceasefire brokered by the UN on January 3.
UN officials said the pace of deployment was expected to pick up over the
next week, and a force of about 14,000 peacekeepers would be in place by
April 25. Some 29 police officers from Argentina arrived on Saturday in
Belgrade, the Serbian and federal capital. A force of 29 Swedes and 29 Danes
was yesterday expected to join some 500 peacekeepers already despatched to
three UN Protected Areas in Croatia.
Meanwhile officials from the Yugoslav and Croat armies after two days of
talks brokered by the International Red Cross in Pecs, southern Hungary,
agreed at the weekend on a full exchange of prisoners of war, according to
Tanjug, the Belgrade-based news agency.

After a year of multi-party democracy, Albanians returned to the polls
yesterday for an election that could break the former communists' grip on
power, Reuter reports from Tirana.
'This day marks the end of communism and the beginning of democracy in
Albania,' said opposition leader Sali Berisha, whose inexperienced
Democratic party was trounced by the former communists in last year's polls.
Turnout was high in the capital, Tirana. But many voters delayed their
arrival at polling stations until they had queued for bread dis-tributed by
the army - a daily necessity in the chaos that followed last year's poll.
No big disturbances were reported.
The elections, in which more than 500 candidates were fighting for places in
a new 140-seat assembly, caps a year of political and social turmoil as
Europe's poorest state tries to cope with the birth-pains of democracy.
Results are expected today.
The Democratic party said one entire set of ballot slips had been stolen
from a southern village and incomplete electoral lists were causing delays
and confusion elsewhere.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE what in communist days was Korce's Palace of Culture, a line of
neatly-dressed Albanians waited to vote yesterday in the country's second
free elections in just under a year.
There was almost complete silence inside, as voters marked their ballot
slips behind a bright orange curtain and dropped them into a box sealed with
string and plasticine.
Polling seemed orderly in Korce, the largest town in southern Albania - in
contrast with last year, when voters, especially in the surrounding
villages, were physically intimidated by the security police, according to
candidates and local officials.
The Democratic party hopes to reverse last year's defeat by the Socialists,
the renamed communists, by attracting a substantial percentage of votes in
the countryside.
'Last year we won in Korce and most towns but we lost the election because
we didn't have transport to reach the villages,' says Mr Petrika Minga, the
Democrats' district chairman.
As well as owning battered cars now, Democratic party candidates have been
covering the countryside in brand new American jeeps, accompanied by
American diplomats. This helps reinforce an impression, already widespread
among Albanians, that US aid and investment will be the key to rescuing the
country from its deep economic impasse.
The Democrats say they will win about 55 per cent of the vote and an overall
majority in parliament, which will have up to 155 seats, depending on how
many parties meet the 4 per cent of the vote threshold for representation in
the chamber.
Although 11 parties are fielding candidates, the Social Democrats and the
conservative Republicans are alone among smaller groups in expecting to win
more than the odd seat. The Human Rights Committee, an umbrella for the
ethnic Greek party banned from the election, complains that several of its
candidates were illegally prevented from running.
The Socialists, who claim they will be the strongest parliamentary party,
say that because of a fiercely polarised political climate only a coalition
of politicians and technocrats from all big parties will be able to govern
the country.
But it has been under a succession of weak and quarrelsome coalition
governments that Albania has slipped into near anarchy in the past nine
months. Many local officials carry pistols to work and foreign businessmen
have been forced to hire bodyguards.
The country now depends mainly on foreign aid, provided mostly by Italy over
the winter, for basic food supplies. Industrial output is down to about 20
per cent of its levels before the Stalinist regime collapsed at the end of
1990, and seems likely to fall further, since much post-election aid will
have to be channelled into food production.
But even so, farm production will be only around 25 per cent of last year's
because disputes over land privatisation meant that virtually no cereals
were planted last autumn.
'Whoever comes to power in Albania now must be an optimist,' says Mr Ilir
Manushi, the Korce district governor.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Brussels seeks deal on export of recyclable toxic waste
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC environment ministers will today try to agree a framework for the export
of recyclable toxic waste, amid intense pressure from MEPs and environmental
lobbyists to adopt tough restrictions.
Before the environment council begins, Mr Ken Collins, the British Labour
MEP and chairman of the European parliament's influential environment
committee, will put the MEPs' case directly to Mr Carlos Borrego, the
Portuguese minister who will chair the meeting, and other ministers.
The parliament is calling for a ban on all exports of hazardous waste from
the EC from the year 2000. The Community has already banned the export of
waste to 69 developing countries in Africa, the Caribbean and Pacific (ACP).
The Commission also agrees to a total ban on the export of waste for final
disposal. But it believes EC member states should be allowed to ship
recyclable waste to countries which are members of the OECD and have
ratified the Basle convention on waste shipments.
The Commission said on Friday that political agreement was possible today,
but national officials believe the measure may be too complex to agree in a
single meeting. A meeting of technical experts is expected at the same time
in an attempt to resolve the more detailed problems.
Without the Commission's support, the parliament's powers to change the
measure are limited, but MEPs could delay or disrupt the procedure when the
directive is given a second reading.
Greenpeace, the environmental lobby group, warned last week of the dangers
of 'toxic colonialism' if the EC made any move to allow waste shipments to
third countries on the basis merely of bilateral agreements. Such an
approach could lead to developing non-ACP countries accepting waste which
they did not know how to recycle safely, said the group.

<TEXT>
THE possible sale of the missile and aircraft divisions of LTV, the large
bankrupt US steel maker, to France's Thomson-CSF should be reviewed because
of its potential impact on national and economic security, the chairman and
vice-chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee havetold President George
Bush, Nancy Dunne writes in Washington.
Similar concern was expressed in a letter to Mr Bush on March 10 from 40
senators of both parties, worried that foreign companies, backed by their
governments, might obtain advanced technology.
The sale of LTV's aircraft and missiles division to Vought, a newly formed
group jointly owned by Martin Marietta and Lockheed, could be jeopardised,
the senators said, by 'a pending higher offer' from Thomson-CSF, the French
defence electronics group, and Carlyle Group, a Washington investment
banking firm.
Although LTV and its union have accepted the Vought offer, there is concern
that a federal bankruptcy court will require LTV to accept Thomson's higher
offer.
The letter said Vought would operate as a single company, while under the
Thomson-CSF plan, the aircraft and missiles division would be broken up.

   SANTIAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE disclosure of a secret police force that spied on military officers,
trade union leaders and political opponents has seriously embarrassed
President Patricio Aylwin's government in Chile.
Mr Aylwin is being accused of emulating the dictatorial practices of his
predecessor, General Augusto Pinochet.
The spying scandal was disclosed by the Union of Independent Democrats
(UDI), a small right-wing party best known for its loyalty to the former
dictator. The scandal has allowed UDI to recapture the moral high-ground
after being taunted for failing to defend human rights during Gen Pinochet's
rule.
'This government was elected to correct the errors of the past, not to
repeat them,' Mr Jovino Novoa, UDI's president, said at the weekend.
The government has not contested the veracity of the classified documents
that fell into the hands of its opponents.
Mr Horacio Toro, chief of Investigaciones, the civilian police force, was
forced to resign on Friday. President Aylwin wrote to him saying:
'Instructions issued under your orders . . . have gravely damaged the
credibility of this government in the field of civil liberties.'
Few Chileans believe, however, that Mr Toro acted on his own initiative. UDI
has called for a parliamentary inquiry to determine who gave Mr Toro his
orders. The police chief's immediate boss is the home secretary, Mr Enrique
Krauss, who is one of President Aylwin's closest advisers.
The documents revealed by UDI gave details of instructions to a 'special
branch' of Investigaciones to report monthly on the activities of the
government's political and trade union opponents, including their family
lives.
Of particular interest was a 'Falcon Plan' to keep tabs on Gen Pinochet's
meetings with business leaders and politicians.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Clinton adds voice to calls for reform of Congress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNOR Bill Clinton of Arkansas, overwhelming favourite to be the
Democratic party's presidential nominee, yesterday added his voice to the
calls for reform in the way the US Congress does business.
But he did so in a materially different way from President George Bush's
demand that the solution lay in throwing out the Democrats from their long
control of the legislature.
Interviewed on TV, Mr Clinton agreed that Congress was too entrenched in its
way, was too subject to pressure from special interest groups, and probably
enjoyed too many perks. But the real problem, he went on, was the lack of a
real partnership between the president and Congress. The Reagan and Bush
administrations had been so intent on confrontation that they had 'let
Congress drift in an unfortunate way'.
It was, he said, typical that Mr Bush should veto, as announced on Friday,
the lastest economic reform package passed on Capitol Hill. It was a serious
attempt to deal with real economic problems, Mr Clinton said, and
inappropriate for the president to block it simply because it would have
increased income taxes on the wealthiest Americans.
In the 1980s, he said, citing a recent report from the Congressional Budget
Office, national income had been significantly redistributed in favour of
the better-off. If president, he would ensure no repetition of this.
This represents Mr Clinton's first attempt to counter the latest tactic in
the Bush strategy of declaring war on the Democrats in Congress. This is
designed to capitalise on some of the scandals engulfing the legislature,
which have in turn accentuated the mood against incumbent politicians. In
calling for Congress to mend its ways, while putting much of the blame on
the president, Mr Clinton hopes to rally the party behind him.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (5): Tax incentives attract -
Offshore companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIFTEEN years of quiet growth as an offshore centre has brought a diversity
of business to the republic of Cyprus, including multinational corporations,
banks and shipping companies.
The central bank issued a record 1,270 registration permits for offshore
enterprises in 1991, bringing the total to more than 8,000 since 1976 when
Cyprus introduced offshore incentives. While most are 'brass-plate' entities
 -often set up to hold a wealthy individual's private assets - about 900
companies operate full-fledged offices.
Pepsi-Cola, RJ Reynolds, Alico and United Distillers are among familiar
names using Cyprus as a base for their regional operations. There are almost
20 offshore banking units (OBUs), among them Barclays and Banque Nationale
de Paris, and more than 70 shipping companies, including leading ship
managers such as Columbia and Hanseatic.
Initially, Cyprus was as seen as a convenient perch for businessmen driven
out of Lebanon by civil war. Then its appeal as a comfortable base for
expatriate staff was discovered by the multinationals. In the past year,
however, the largest number of new arrivals has been from eastern Europe,
mostly companies from the breakaway Yugoslav republics or the ex-Soviet
Union.
For the sake of being close to their markets, companies are clearly prepared
to discount what sets Cyprus apart from islands like Malta and Madeira, its
nearest offshore competitors: the division of the island into Greek and
Turkish Cypriot sectors separated by a UN peacekeeping force.
'European companies probably give less weight to the Cyprus problem than the
Americans. But it's still a factor at the back of everyone's mind,' says a
banker.
However, Cyprus offers advantages such as relatively low wages and housing
costs, along with a pool of highly skilled labour; it boasts more university
graduates in proportion to the population than any other country in Europe.
Respectability is a word stressed by officials in charge of offshore
registrations. 'We're not a tax haven; we're offering tax incentives,' says
Mr Sophocles Michaelides of the central bank.
The difference, he says, lies in the controls exercised by the central bank.
All offshore companies must submit an audited financial statement every
year. Those with full-fledged offices must also produce a confidential
annual report detailing their current financial status. Audits are carried
out by local accountants, mostly trained in Britain.
Banks are examined carefully before being allowed to set up in Cyprus. The
preference is for branches or subsidiaries of 'reputable' organisations
rather than a bank seeking incorporation on the island though, once
established, the OBUs enjoy confidentiality similar to that in Luxembourg.
A new financial services bill, expected to pass in parliament later this
year, is intended to give greater protection against fraud. It will empower
Cypriot authorities to license and supervise offshore financial service
companies, seen as a potential growth area.
The other piece of legislation awaiting parliamentary approval is an
international trust bill, based on UK trust law. It will update existing
regulations on trusts established in Cyprus by non-resident investors,
basing incentives on the beneficiary's country of residence.
Tax incentives for offshore companies include paying only 4.25 per cent tax
on earnings and exemption from capital gains tax from share transfers in an
offshore company. Expatriate employees pay income tax at half the local rate
and can import new cars and household goods duty-free. Improvements in
telecommunications in the past few years have helped to attract more
offshore companies. The switch-over to digital exchanges and transmission
systems was followed at once by the introduction of cellular telephones and
paging facilities.
However, the most frequently heard complaint from offshore managers concerns
a special 20 per cent tax levied on their telecommunications expenses. It
seems unlikely to be lifted soon; the central bank says that offshore
companies must expect to contribute to maintaining the high standards of
telecommunications.
Increased anxiety about security, a consequence of the Gulf war, has
resulted in tighter controls on issuing residence permits. Owners of
'brass-plate' companies are no longer entitled to residence in Cyprus.
Foreigners working as domestic staff may be sent home after two years. Both
moves have provoked strong objections from Cypriot lawyers and accountants
who service the offshore operations.
'We get calls from annoyed expatriates whose 'au pairs' are being refused an
extension of their residence permits. It's bad for Cyprus's image,' says Mr
Michael Zampelas of Ioannou Zampelas, the local member of Coopers and
Lybrand.
For the past few years, new offshore shipping and ship management companies
have been opening in the port of Limassol at a rapid rate. This is in
response to an energetic government campaign to attract vessels to the
Cyprus registry, which is now the seventh largest in the world. More
important, about 40 per cent of the 21m-tonne Cypriot fleet is managed from
the island. Limassol can provide a broad range of maritime services.
Fees and tonnage taxes in Cyprus are considered more competitive than in the
Panama and Liberia registries, especially for newer ships. The government is
offering discounts on registering ships under 10 years old in an effort to
bring down the average age of the fleet. That is 14 years at present, and 75
per cent of Cypriot-flag vessels are more than 10 years old.
To encourage more owners of Cyprus-registered ships to establish themselves
on the island, discounts are also being offered to shipping companies using
Cypriot services and employing Cypriot crews.
The government hopes that others will follow the example of Mr Klaus
Oldendorff who moved both his fleet of 20 ships and his offices to Cyprus
from Germany four years ago. 'After some thought, I decided it would be
better to operate my ships out of Cyprus itself. It's a pleasant place to
live and, with the exception of major ship financing, you can carry out
almost all your business here,' Mr Oldendorff says.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (7): Entry may not be so rapid
 -EC membership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CYPRUS IS closer to Baghdad than to Brussels, but that is all the more
reason for Cypriots to feel strongly about joining the European Community.
Political as much as economic considerations were behind the decision by
President George Vassiliou's internationally recognised government to seek
EC membership in July 1990, on behalf of both the island's communities.
Mr Vassiliou was under strong domestic pressure to carry out his campaign
promise of two years earlier, especially since the list of countries seeking
membership was rapidly growing. Still, there was a marked lack of enthusiasm
among larger EC member-states over the timing of the application.
Moreover, Mr Rauf Denktash, leader of the self-styled Turkish Cypriot
republic in the north of the island, who was not consulted, was so annoyed
at the move that he broke off official contacts with the Greek Cypriots for
months.
It was only to be expected that the de facto partition of Cyprus after 1974,
resulting in increased economic disparity as the north stagnated while the
south maintained a growth rate comparable with countries in south-east Asia,
should loom as an almost insurmountable obstacle to accession.
An EC working group headed by Mr Abel Matutes, the commissioner for
Mediterranean affairs, is to issue a formal opinion on the Cypriot bid for
membership by the end of this year. But after the collapse last month of
President George Bush's reunification initiative, it is not even certain
whether the EC officials will be welcome in northern Cyprus.
Greek Cypriot officials like to point out that on their side of the island,
per capita income is higher than in Greece and Portugal, both EC members,
while the growth rate in the 1980s was well above the Community average,
with inflation only now slightly higher.
'If you factor in the figures for the north, the economy still compares
favourably those of Mediterranean members of EC,' says an economist who
follows developments in northern Cyprus.
A customs union agreement signed in 1987 with the EC provides for gradual
lifting of most import duties by 1998, though some manufacturing industries
will continue to be protected from the effects of European competition.
A full customs union is due to come into effect five years later. At that
time, quotas on Cypriot farm exports popular in western Europe, such as
potatoes and grapes, will be removed.
The Community has long been the biggest trading partner for internationally
recognised Cyprus, although its share of Cypriot trade overall has shown
only a slow rise since the tariff agreement was introduced in 1988.
In 1990, 52.9 per cent of imports originated in the EC, while 47.4 per cent
of exports went to Community members, mainly Britain and Greece.
Government planners say they are structuring economic policy as if Cyprus
were to join the EC later this decade. Value-added tax is to be introduced
on July 1, at a single-tier rate of 5 per cent, though it is forecast to
rise sharply in 1993. The Cyprus pound is to be unofficially pegged to the
Ecu later this year.
However, if this commitment is to be followed through, it would involve some
politically wrenching decisions over lifting exchange controls and the 9 per
cent interest rate ceiling.
The island's future as an offshore business centre, together with its
flourishing international shipping registry, would also start to look
uncertain.
On the political front, Cyprus would almost certainly have to give up its
prominent position in the non-aligned movement in order to fulfil the
obligations of European political union. That, if nothing else, could make
some of the island's well-travelled politicians think twice about supporting
a quick entry to the Community.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (8): Nibbling at the edges -
Ecology and the environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE entrance to the Avagas gorge, at the base of the Akamas peninsula in
western Cyprus, used to look like an early traveller's engraving: a quiet
pasture dotted with juniper and wild olive trees. But last month, the
bulldozers moved in, churning up the ground for cultivation.
The Akamas is a 155 sq km wilderness with an unusual variety of bird and
plant life, some of it unique to Cyprus. There are sandy beaches where the
rare green turtle lays its eggs, an aromatic pine forest and dramatic cliff
walks. Increasingly, it is becoming a refuge from the concrete
agglomerations of hotels and holiday apartments lining much of the coast.
It has escaped development so far because of its remoteness. One area is
used as a firing range by British forces from the two sovereign bases on the
island. Until recently the only other visitors were hunters and botanists.
But mass tourism has now spread to western Cyprus. Paphos, the resort
closest to the peninsula, has an international airport. Land prices have
rocketed, much to the relief of villagers who feared being left out of the
property boom elsewhere on the island.
Although the Akamas was declared a national park in 1989 in response to
pressure from a vociferous local environmental movement, little has been
done since them to ensure its protection.
'The park is being nibbled away at the edges, a banana grove here, a summer
house there. In places like the Avagas gorge it doesn't take much to upset
the ecological balance,' says Mr David Pearlman of Exalt, a Paphos travel
agency that takes small groups to explore the Akamas.
The government is under pressure from would-be developers with landholdings
in the Akamas, among them the Orthodox church and some prominent Cypriot
businessmen, to grant permits for building several luxury hotels.
The environmentalist lobby wants existing zoning regulations to be more
strictly enforced until legislation is prepared to protect the area and a
park management plan approved. They also want the British military to stop
using the Akamas for training with live ammunition.
The environmentalists have found little support around Paphos. They are
criticised by clergymen and threatened by villagers opposed to plans for
agro-tourism projects, small-scale development in traditional surroundings,
in a buffer zone at the edge of the park.
However, the European Community is backing an agro-tourism scheme which has
begun in a group of villages further inland which are unlikely to attract
mass tourism. The Laona project was launched with an Ecu100,000 (Dollars
125,000) grant plus private sector contributions. Twenty old houses are
being restored or converted for tourists looking for a taste of traditional
village life.
The success of a project to protect the green turtle, a threatened species,
testifies to what can be achieved if the Akamas is properly looked after.
Tourists are banned from Lara beach at night, the time when turtles crawl
out of the sea, dig nests in the sand and lay clutches of eggs. After 15
years of surveillance during the summer nesting season and selective raising
of hatchlings by a turtle monitoring group, the numbers have started to
increase. 'More young females are coming back to lay at Lara. It's an
encouraging sign,' says Mr Andreas Demetropoulos of the fisheries
department.
A park management study for the Akamas is to be carried out next year by the
Mediterranean Technical Assistance Programme (Metap), which is supported by
the UN and the World Wildlife Fund. Afterwards, Cyprus would be eligible for
World Bank funding for implementing it. Environmentalists worry whether it
will be possible to hold off the developers for a few more years.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (6): Contacts spur trade -
Eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GIVEN THAT, until recently, the Cyprus Communist Party (Akel) was assured of
winning one-third of the vote in any election, it is not surprising that
Greek Cypriots from all walks of life have a network of contacts in eastern
Europe.
One of the ways that Akel retained voter loyalty as the island grew
wealthier was by offering scholarships to eastern European universities to
bright offspring of its supporters. As a result, a sizeable number of Greek
Cypriots are well-placed to offer their services to local companies seeking
opportunities in the former Soviet Union and its satellites.
Some of the infrastructure is already in place. Cyprus is a shareholder in
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, though its stake
amounts to just 1 per cent. It has signed double taxation treaties with all
the eastern European countries except Poland and Albania. There are direct
flights to their capitals since Cyprus has long been a popular destination
for tourists from eastern Europe.
Several Cypriot companies are looking for service sector niches in which to
operate. 'They're prepared to invest time and energy in something that might
well be overlooked or dismissed by larger foreign companies, even though it
offers promising medium or long-term prospects,' says a foreign banker.
Over the past year, executives from Russia, Ukraine, Georgia and Kazakhstan
have been attending two-week management seminars in Nicosia, organised by
Ioannou Zampelas, the local member of Coopers and Lybrand. Most of them hold
senior jobs in medium-sized factories, struggling to make the transition
from a command system to a new economic reality. Because these enterprises
have training budgets, they are able to cover the cost of a seminar abroad,
according to Mr Nicos Nicolaides of Ioannou Zampelas.
'It's much cheaper for them to come to Cyprus than go to London or Paris.
It's also a less intimidating place for people who've never been abroad
before,' he says.
The seminars, held in English with simultaneous translation into Russian,
focus on explaining essential western business techniques, from marketing
and incentive schemes to cash flow forecasts and stock level controls.
Principles of banking, finance and insurance are also covered.
'We thought we'd mainly be doing accounting but found a much broader
approach was needed. We've grown more flexible, getting into more discussion
both in the seminars and during the socialising afterward,' says Mr Dimitri
Khenkin, the company's Russian specialist.
In the meantime, the Louis Organisation, the largest travel agency on the
island, is expanding into Russia, Poland and Bulgaria. The opening up of
eastern Europe came just as Louis, which owns a chain of 30 hotels, plus
three cruise ships and a catering and duty-free operation, was starting to
look for new business outside Cyprus.
'It's difficult for a company like ours, big here but small by international
standards, to go into western Europe. But we can make our mark in eastern
Europe,' says Mr Stelios Kiliaris, the company's financial director.
Louis has signed joint venture agreements to manage duty-free shops and
provide catering services, both at Warsaw's new international airport, and
at Vnukovo airport in Moscow. The company is also taking over management of
a 700-bed hotel complex at Sudol, near Moscow.
In Bulgaria, Louis is cashing in on local enthusiasm for all things American
by launching a fast-food restaurant in the centre of Sofia. This, it is
hoped, will be the first in a chain of hamburger outlets named Americana.
'Our total outlay in eastern Europe is not as much as you'd think ' well
under Dollars 10m,' says Mr Kiliaris.
Still, negotiating each deal proved a long drawn-out process, according to
Mr Nicos Antoniades, a Minsk-trained engineer in charge of Louis's eastern
European activities.
Also in Bulgaria, Mr Nikos Vassiliou, a Nicosia-based technical consultant
is putting together a joint venture intended to revive a plant at a large
collective farm outside Sofia that produces electricity from cow manure. The
fertiliser and bio-gas installation at Podgumar state farm, completed six
years ago at a cost of Dollars 3m, was intended to be an environmental
showpiece. But, according to Mr Vassiliou: 'It only worked for about six
months and now it's become a pollution hazard because of the huge build-up
of slurry.'
Mr Vassiliou is looking for Dollars 1.6m to cover reviving and expanding the
plant, partly from the European Community investment partners programme,
with the remainder to be raised through supplier credits and a commercial
loan.
'Opportunities are there in privatisation. With a fairly small amount of
capital you can turn around a semi-bankrupt enterprise in a short time. It
would take about six months for Podgumar to become profitable,' Mr Vassiliou
says. At the same time, Mr Vassiliou found himself running an informal
employment agency, finding Greek- and English-speaking Bulgarians for jobs
available in Cyprus in hotels and factories, the two areas where the
island's labour shortage is most sorely felt.
About 600 skilled workers are now registered with Mr Vassiliou's office.
After a government-led trip to Russia for Cypriot businessmen, he is also
receiving applications from Pontians, ethnic Greeks from the southern
republics of the former Soviet Union.
'We can offer them contracts to fill a specific vacancy, usually for a
limited period,' he says. 'If their skills fit well, it can be longer. One
of our successes was finding Bulgarian tobacco workers for the British
American Tobacco factory here.'

FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (4): Golden age still prevails
in the commercial sector - Banking

DESPITE its small size, Cyprus has one of the most efficient and
sophisticated banking systems in the world. And Cypriot-owned banks are
already outgrowing the island, looking for fresh fields abroad.
There are 12 banking institutions operating on the island, most of them
privately owned, while Cyprus is also the base for some 20 offshore banking
units.
Banking services have developed considerably in recent years. Most banks now
have fully computerised on-line systems, are connected to the Society for
Worldwide lnterbank Financial Telecommunications (Swift), offer home and
telephone banking and have modern dealing rooms for foreign exchange
deposits. There are automatic telling machines (ATMs) in the main towns.
As far as using advanced technology, Cyprus banks are abreast of many other
countries, says Mr Philip Tew, a director of Lombard NatWest Bank which
although it was incorporated in 1960, started full commercial banking
services only a year ago.
The island's location, its excellent telecommunications, air links and
highly qualified labour force, make it attractive for any international
organisation, especially if it wants to do business with the eastern
Mediterranean, the Middle East and North Africa.
But with more than 450 branches and offices in the main towns, business
centres and tourist resorts, offering all kinds of banking services, the
domestic market looks saturated. There are also some 360 co-operative credit
societies and savings banks which offer extensive services to the local
population, sometimes on easier, more attractive terms.
Even so, the 'golden age' for commercial banks still prevails in Cyprus. The
recession and bad debts provisions that hit many international banks have
not so far affected the island. According to figures provided by the central
bank, total profits of the banking sector over the period 1980-90 showed an
annual average growth of 24.4 per cent. Total assets grew from about CPounds
890m pounds to CPounds 3.5bn - an average annual growth rate of 16.6 per
cent - while deposits increased by an annual average of 16.8 per cent and
lending by about 14 per cent over the same period.
Banking officials believe business in 1992 will be buoyant, especially with
regard to tourism-related services such as hotels, restaurants, car hire and
entertainment.
The short-term outlook is good. Long-term prospects depend to a great extent
on Cyprus's aspiration to move closer to the European Community. A great
deal of adjustment would be needed to bring the relevant regulations into
line with those of the EC and this could produce a lot of stresses and
strains. Among other things, it would mean liberalisation of exchange
controls and abolition of the 9 per cent ceiling on interest rates.
Mr Michael Shadrach, local director of Barclays, says interest rates need to
be deregulated. The 9 per cent ceiling set by law is an 'anachronism'
because it does not apply anywhere else in Europe. He also says that the 7
per cent interest on deposits set by the authorities is not adhered to by
all banks and this creates unfair competition.
Even so, Barclays has expanded its operations in the past few years and now
has 48 offices with more than 500 staff. It has set up several specialised
units including a finance corporation and an insurance division.
Competition among banks is intense, but Mr Shadrach says the real problem is
'the regulations which do not allow banks a decent return.' He believes, for
example, that the minimum liquidity requirement set by the central bank
(averaging 30 per cent this year) is too high and restricts the banks'
ability to offer more credit to customers. But it is generally admitted that
in view of the absence of any other mechanism, this is the only way the
authorities can exercise monetary control over banks.
Perhaps because of these constraints, two of the leading Cypriot banks have
expanded into foreign markets, opening offices in countries with sizeable
Cypriot communities.
The Bank of Cyprus, the largest banking organisation on the island with a 45
per cent share of the market as far as commercial bank operations are
concerned, plans to set up more offices in Greece (in Piraeus this summer
and in Salonika next year) after the successful launch of its branch in
Athens a year go.
Mr Solon Triantafyllides, chairman of the group, said the bank hoped to open
a representative office in New York this summer and was thinking of turning
similar offices in Australia (Melbourne and Sydney) into fully-fledged
banking units. Canada and South Africa are included in its future plans.
Meanwhile, the Bank of Cyprus (London), with seven branches including one in
Birmingham, is further extending its services by setting up a representative
office in Manchester.
The group, with more rey than 250 branches and offices in Cyprus and a staff
of 2,000, reported a 3.5 per cent rise in profits last year while Mr
Triantafyllides confidently predicted much higher profits this year cause of
the expected tourist boom. Group assets reached CPounds 1.7bn, up 13 per
cent.
The Popular Bank, the second largest with some 150 offices and branches, is
attempting to catch up by employing an aggressive marketing policy and is
also reaching beyond the island. Founded 90 years ago, it moved to London
and Birmingham a few years ago while recently it also set up representative
offices in Australia and plans to do the same in New York.
Last December, approval was given by the Greek authorities for the setting
up of the European Popular Bank in Greece later this year. This is a joint
venture by the Cyprus Popular Bank, the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corporation (which also has a 21.6 per cent holding in the share capital of
the Cypriot bank) and a group of Cypriot and Greek businessman. The Popular
Bank, with a 51 per cent majority holding, will retain management of the new
bank. The Honkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation participates with an 11
per cent direct holding.
Mr Kikis Lazarides, the group chief executive, said the aim of the European
Popular Bank would be to expand rapidly in Greece and at later stage in
other EC countries.
The other Cypriot Bank, Hellenic, with 67 branches, is introducing new
schemes to attract domestic business and increase its share of the market.
Earlier this month it announced its 'Extra' account under which customers
with savings accounts are able to issue cheques or use a cash-card for
withdrawals while enjoying a 4 per cent interest on the minimum monthly
balance. 'We consider it a revolutionary scheme which adds to our range of
banking services,' said Mr Matios Clerides, of the bank's planning and
marketing department.
Another bank offering full services on the island is the Jordan-based Arab
Bank which moved to Cyprus in 1984 and which now has 16 branches mainly in
Nicosia and Limassol, the island's southern port city where there is also a
small Arab community.
Mr Chris Stephani, area executive, said the bank planned further expansion,
including the construction of a head office in Nicosia. He said Arab Bank
had boosted its market share through an injection of foreign exchange for
the financing of big tourist projects and other development schemes on the
island.
The local banks have set up special units to cater for the estimated 900
offshore enterprises on the island. But they complain about 'unfair
competition' from the co-operative credit societies which handle about 35
per cent of total local banking business.
The co-op institutions, which have deep roots in Cyprus, especially among
the rural population, accept deposits and offer loans to members especially
for financing of houses, agriculture, trade and industry. They are
controlled by the Co-operative Central Bank, which is also an importer and
distributor of fertilisers and other agricultural items); they do not pay
income tax and they are outside the control of the central bank. Total
deposits with the co-op societies in 1990 exceeded CPounds 900m while laons
reached CPounds 780m.
In addition, long-term housing and other property finance is provided by the
Housing Finance Corporation while medium- and long-term finance for
development projects (mainly in the industrial and tourist sectors) is
provided by the Development Bank, basically a government-owned institution
which also offers feasibility studies and acts as business consultant.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (3): Signs of overheating - The
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE unofficial indicators of prosperity in eastern Mediterranean countries -
weekend traffic jams, supermarkets filled with well-groomed shoppers and
crowded seaside restaurants - are much in evidence in Cyprus.
A heavy emphasis on consumer spending is one enduring consequence of the
upheaval in 1974 when about 180,000 Greek Cypriots were driven from the
north of the island, leaving behind hotels, factories and citrus orchards
that represented more than 60 per cent of the island's resources.
Another is the Greek Cypriot insistence on acquiring skills abroad, a
reflection both of high unemployment in the early years of rebuilding and
the sense of security derived from being able, if necessary, to earn a
living outside the island. In fact, economic recovery came swiftly in the
south, with priority given to short-term infrastructure projects financed
through foreign aid and borrowing. It took only five years for incomes to
return to pre-1974 levels.
Exports rose as new, labour-intensive manufacturing exploited demand in the
Gulf states during the oil boom, while services benefited from Beirut's
decline as a business centre. When mass tourism took off in the south, the
growth rate also soared, averaging more than 5 per cent in the late 1980s.
However, the Gulf war dealt the tourist industry a harsh blow last year.
Although bookings picked up as the season advanced, hoteliers were obliged
to accept sharply reduced prices to ensure occupancy rates that would cover
the year's costs.
Exports were also affected with a number of small plants dependent on orders
from the Gulf being forced to shut down, while port activity at Limassol, a
regional transhipment centre, slowed down.
As if this were not enough to contend with, a severe drought hit Cyprus last
winter. With little water available for irrigation despite a sustained
conservation effort, agricultural output fell by 10.1 per cent. The economy
grew by just 1.5 per cent in 1991.
Yet this appears to have been only a temporary setback, according to the
government planning bureau. Projected growth for 1992 is 7 per cent, led by
a recovery in exports and what seems likely to be a record year for tourism.
But as Cyprus heads into an election year, signs of overheating are
emerging. Inflation reached 6 per cent last year; the introduction of value
added tax this summer may bring it to 7.5 per cent this year.
While exports remained steady at CPounds 390m in 1991, imports surged by 20
per cent as consumers launched a spending spree in advance of VAT. This,
coupled with a decline in tourism earnings, transformed a current account
surplus of CPounds 40m in 1990 into a CPounds 110.8m deficit, equivalent to
3.8 per cent of GDP.
With collective wage agreements in several sectors coming up for renewal
this year, the unions will be asking for larger rises on top of index-linked
increases twice a year. Their bargaining power is enhanced by a labour
shortage which has forced employers to import short-term contract workers,
mostly from eastern Europe.
'Real increases of 3-4 per cent a year are standard now, and the unions are
a militant bunch. It will be hard to restrain demand in an election year,'
says one analyst.
The government has little room to manoeuvre, after being forced by
Parliament not only to limit VAT to a single 5 per cent rate but to postpone
its introduction for six months. In the meantime, a new tax package,
including across-the-board cuts in income tax, had already come into effect.
The resulting budget deficit amounted to 5.1 per cent of GDP, double the
previous year's figure. But given the pre-electoral commitment to spending
on high profile projects such as port and road improvements, the deficit is
unlikely to shrink much this year.
Still, whatever the imbalances in southern Cyprus, they pale into
insignificance against the problems facing the self-styled Turkish Cypriot
republic.
The collapse in 1990 of the fruit-to-electronics empire of Mr Asil Nadir, a
Cypriot by birth, cut short a brief period of optimism about the future.
About 8,000 Turkish Cypriots, some 12 per cent of the workforce, were
employed in a dozen companies he controlled in northern Cyprus, from citrus
exporting to packaging, hotels and newspaper publishing. With three-quarters
of Mr Nadir's employees now out of work, northern Cyprus again relies
heavily on aid from Turkey, amounting to more than Dollars 60m yearly. Over
the years, Turkish state banks have also financed construction of roads, two
airports and expansion at Kyrenia port. Yet per capita income in the north
is less than one-third that in internationally-recognised Cyprus and appears
to be falling further behind. No official figures are available, but growth
last year is thought to have been negative, after a 5.5 per cent rise in
1990.
While crossing the Green Line that divides Cyprus is officially forbidden,
several hundred Turkish Cypriots slip into the south daily to put in a few
hours of work on a Greek Cypriot construction site.
As in the south, tourism is the mainstay of the economy, with some 600,000
visitors from Turkey last year but only 42,000 foreign tourists. Northern
Cyprus was also hit badly by cancellations due to the Gulf crisis. This
year, a 30 per cent increase in foreign arrivals is forecast, the result of
more effective marketing in western Europe, and receipts may rise to Dollars
25m.
But sharing a currency with Turkey means that northern Cyprus imports a
Turkish inflation rate of more than 70 per cent. Index-linking of wages now
lags several months behind, adding to the gloomy mood.
With each year that passes, it becomes clearer that without a political
settlement, the economic gap between Greek and Turkish Cypriots can only
continue to widen.

THE roofless houses and rusting barbed wire around the UN checkpoint in
central Nicosia could be part of an abandoned film set. But a loitering
soldier in a blue serge cap serves as a reminder that Cyprus remains a
divided island where most Greek and Turkish Cypriots have been unable to
exchange even a greeting for almost 18 years.
The contrasts within the city underline how the two communities' paths
diverged after Turkish forces invaded the north of the island in 1974 in
response to a coup plotted in Athens which aimed at uniting Cyprus with
Greece.
Tall, white office and apartment blocks crowned with satellite dishes
overlook the UN-patrolled 'green line' on the southern side. The Greek
Cypriots, forced to rebuild their lives after abandoning the northern third
of the island, proved so successful at developing tourism, textile
manufacturing and offshore services that per capita income in the
internationally-recognised Cyprus republic compares with Spain.
The Turkish Cypriots, an 18 per cent minority in the island's population of
600,000, live quietly in what resembles a Turkish provincial town, apart
from a newish suburb housing the administration of the self-styled Turkish
Republic of Northern Cyprus, recognised only by Turkey.
The presence of almost 30,000 Turkish soldiers in the breakaway state, plus
some 50,000 settlers from mainland Turkey - brought in to cultivate farmland
left idle when the Greek Cypriots fled - reinforces the impression that
northern Cyprus is somehow an outpost of Anatolia.
Nevertheless, the Turkish Cypriots are also better off than before, thanks
to tourism and investments by Asil Nadir, the Turkish Cypriot entrepreneur
now facing fraud charges in Britain after the collapse of his
fruit-to-electronics group.
But given its lack of international respectability, northern Cyprus
generally holds little attraction for investors, making it heavily dependent
on aid from Turkey - said to have totalled more than Dollars 500m since 1974
 -and loans from Turkish banks. Wages in the north are only one quarter of
southern levels and unemployment is rising, while several thousand jobs
remain unfilled in the south.
As Greek Cypriot businessmen are starting to point out, there would be no
shortage of economic opportunity if the two communities could reunite, even
in a much looser relationship than the bi-communal system of government
which collapsed in 1963, only three years after independence from Britain.
'The pie is now big enough for both of us. We should accept that they want
to live separately from us and co-operate accordingly,' says a Greek Cypriot
financial consultant, one of a group that recently started building contacts
with Turkish Cypriot businessmen.
The politicians do not necessarily agree. Although intercommunal talks over
the years, sponsored by successive UN secretaries-general, eventually
produced the outlines of a settlement, the crucial details remain to be
resolved. The idea is that Cyprus would be reunified as a bi-zonal
federation where Greek and Turkish Cypriots could move freely, work and live
in each other's zones.
The two communities would share power in a federal government more concerned
with promoting Cypriot interests abroad than regulating domestic affairs.
Most Turkish troops would go home and compensation would be paid to
islanders who decided not to return to their pre-1974 homes.
But a considerable amount of political goodwill is needed to resolve
arguments over how much territory the Turkish Cypriots should hand back, how
many Greek Cypriots will eventually be allowed to move north again and how
often a Turkish Cypriot should serve as president of Cyprus. This goodwill
still seems to be lacking, even after US President George Bush voiced a
personal interest last summer in seeing the Cyprus problem solved, thus
providing the inspiration for a fresh UN negotiating effort.
'It is very frustrating because 90 per cent of the settlement is already
there. If the breakthrough were to happen, the UN officials could have an
agreement ready to sign in a matter of days,' says a western diplomat.
To the Greek Cypriots, and also some outside observers, the stumbling block
is Mr Rauf Denktash, leader of the breakaway state, who now demands full
political equality for the Turkish Cypriot community in a Swiss-style
federation.
'We shall never say Yes to a federation that is not based on our
sovereignty,' he says.
Mr Denktash, whose avowed priority is to safeguard his community from a
return to the days of discrimination and periodic violence at the hands of
the Greek Cypriot majority, is also criticised by the Turkish Cypriot
opposition as an autocratic leader unwilling to trade some of his personal
authority in return for a settlement.
On the other hand, President George Vassiliou, the Greek Cypriot leader
whose background as a millionaire businessman and political newcomer
initially made him more flexible, is constrained by the probability that he
will seek a second term in a presidential election to be held next year.
He now seems to favour the conventional view, backed by Greek and Greek
Cypriot politicians, that the only way forward is for President Bush to
press the Turkish government to convince Mr Denktash that the moment for a
settlement has finally arrived.
But one indication that he still feels optimistic is the preparation of a
Greek Cypriot master-plan for reuniting the two economies. 'We think it will
be possible to bring the Turkish Cypriots up to our level within two years,
without any pain,' he says.
Despite Mr Vassiliou's inability so far to bring about a solution, he will
still be the front-runner if he decides to seek re-election.
One result of a rapidly improving standard of living for Greek Cypriots over
the past four years has been to push what is known as 'the national issue'
further into the background. 'There are times when you feel it's a topic for
discussion over dinner, no longer really part of your life,' says a Greek
Cypriot engineer.
Even the politicians' insistence that a settlement must allow all Greek
Cypriots the right to return to their homes in the north seems at variance
with the views of a younger generation which is growing up in the towns of
the south without any knowledge of Turkish Cypriot community.
Mr Vassiliou, elected with the backing of the still-powerful Cyprus
communist party, Akel, has had his difficulties pushing economic reforms
through parliament as a president without a political party of his own. But
he could only be unseated next year by an alliance of the two right-wing
parties, Democratic Rally and the Democratic Party, whose ageing leaders are
associated with past political embarrassments and old-fashioned attitudes.
Their resilience since the island was effectively partitioned makes the
Greek Cypriots feel confident they will go on prospering on their own. But
Cyprus cannot be assured of long-term security or of achieving its ambition
to join the European Community until the two communities are again united.

FT  23 MAR 92 / Survey of Republic of Cyprus (2): A reputation for quality -
Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BOULI HADJIOANNOU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a season of cancelled bookings and deep price cuts, forecasts of a
record year for Cyprus tourism are being greeted with cautious relief.
The Gulf crisis interrupted a decade of steady expansion in the island's
tourist industry. Foreign visitors were flown home by tour operators worried
about rising insurance costs, while hotel occupancy rates plummeted to 25
per cent in the first few months of 1991. Staff were laid off and some
hotels closed.
'There was a misunderstanding about our geographic position. Attention
tended to focus on how close, rather than how far, we were from the
hostilities,' says Mr Andreas Nicholaou, chairman of the Cyprus Tourist
Organisation (CTO).
Although bookings recovered over the summer, reaching normal levels by
September, arrivals for the year totalled 1.32m, a 15 per cent decline from
the record number of 1.56m in 1990. Foreign exchange earnings fell from
CPounds 573m to CPounds 470m as hoteliers cut prices in an effort to cover
losses earlier in the season.
This year, however, arrivals are projected to reach 1.65m, although revenues
will rise more slowly than in the past. Prices remain close to 1991 levels,
reflecting apprehension that Cyprus would not immediately be able to recover
its share of the European market.
In fact, price stability brought such a rush of bookings in medium-priced
hotels that the CTO had to intervene to prevent overbooking. Operators in
Britain, the main market, are being reassured that anyone left without a
room will be given one in a four- or five-star hotel.
This year, too, hoteliers will be struggling to cope with a staff shortage,
the result of full employment in the south of the island. Foreign contract
workers, many from eastern European countries, are being hired as cooks,
chambermaids and restaurant staff so that as many Cypriots as possible are
available for jobs involving direct contact with visitors.
Last month, Cyprus Airways, the state carrier, launched a charter
subsidiary, Eurocypria, to which it leased two new Airbus A320s. According
to Mr Tassos Angelis, the airline's spokesman, Eurocypria has already sold
140,000 seats, its entire capacity for the season.
In southern Cyprus, tourism grew much faster during the 1980s than in the
rest of Europe, with the development of resorts along the southern and
western coast to replace those abandoned in 1974 after the Turkish invasion
of the north. The growth rate in Europe from 1980-90 averaged 3.5 per cent,
while foreign exchange earnings rose by an average 8.3 per cent. For Cyprus,
the equivalent figures were 16 and 23 per cent.
Apart from being a sun-and-sea destination, with a longer season than Greece
or much of the Turkish Aegean coast, Cyprus is held to offer better
standards of service than in other Mediterranean countries. Even Ayia Napa,
the Cyprus equivalent Benidorm, attracts a proportion of 'repeat' visitors.
Other resorts, especially Paphos, appeal to older tourists who are more
likely to return within two or three years.
Cyprus managed at the same time to acquire a reputation for quality which
the CTO is anxious to preserve. 'The 1990s will be the decade of quality
destinations. They are the ones that will survive in an increasingly
competitive world,' says Mr Nicholaou.
The CTO aims at increasing Cyprus's share of the growing international
market in incentive and conference tourism, adding more marinas to attract
yacht owners south from Greece and Turkey, and developing the special
interest market. Already, Scandinavian and central European soccer teams
hold training sessions in Cyprus. Elderly visitors from Britain or Finland,
escaping from northern European winters for longer stays, can take courses
in botany or Greek cooking.
Until now, Cyprus has not been a regular port of call for Mediterranean
cruise ships. But as local travel agencies have discovered, one profitable
way of keeping visitors entertained is to offer them short cruises to Egypt
and Israel, both within easy reach of the island.
Although an 18-month moratorium on hotel construction has ended, the
intention is to avoid a rash of new building. With 65,000 beds available,
mostly in three-star hotels, capacity is thought be adequate. In future,
priority will be given to four- or five-star hotels with a wide range of
leisure and sports facilities.
Yet if Cyprus is to focus successfully on up-market tourism, the market must
be diversified to include more French, German, Austrian and Swiss visitors.
At present, British tourists account for 49 per cent of arrivals, with
Scandinavians the next-largest category at 16 per cent. The next step being
planned by the CTO is to persuade Americans and Japanese to include Cyprus
on their European itineraries.

MR Hans-Dietrich Genscher, Germany's foreign minister, said at the weekend
he expected Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia to become full members of the
European Community this decade.
The timing would depend on the internal economic and political developments
in these countries, he said.
Noting that these countries had treaties of association with the EC, Mr
Genscher said the door must be held open for later membership of the Baltic
nations and the successor states to Yugoslavia, as well as Romania and
Bulgaria.
Commenting on progress towards European Monetary Union, he said this would
not mean the end of the D-Mark but rather the extension of German stability
to the whole EC - 'thus a Euro-Mark'.
It was important, he added, that the European central bank be sited in
Frankfurt, home of the Bundesbank, which is a symbol of currency stability.

GERMAN police said yesterday they had detained 67 people after anarchists,
many of them masked, hurled rocks and smashed car windows at an anti-racism
demonstration in the eastern city of Leipzig, Reuter reports.
Leipzig city police said 17 officers were slightly injured after 900
policemen, reinforced by paramilitary border guards, used water cannon and
truncheons on Saturday to drive the 400 anarchists away from the city
centre.
Witnesses saw several demonstrators with blood streaming down their faces
from head wounds but the police did not give any figures for the number
hurt.
A police helicopter was struck several times by fireworks hurled by the
demonstrators. Anarchists set car tyres and rubbish containers alight as
they fought behind hastily erected barricades.
Fifteen people were under investigation for illegal possession of arms and
damaging property, police said.
The riot, the biggest in the former communist east Germany since
left-wingers fought police in Halle last November, occurred after a peaceful
demonstration by around 1,000 people.
Carrying banners saying 'Foreigners in, Nazis out', they protested against
another rally in the city organised by the National Offensive, an extreme
right-wing group.
Police said they found a petrol bomb hidden in the square where the neo-Nazi
rally was to start later.
Some 300 right-wingers chanting Adolf Hitler's slogan 'One people, one
Reich, one Fuhrer' and giving the illegal Nazi salute later marched through
central Leipzig.

THE German government's campaign to persuade up to 2m ethnic Germans living
in the former Soviet Union not to emigrate received a serious setback at the
weekend.
Representatives of the so-called Volga German community called on both
Russia and Germany urgently to draw up a plan to enable all who wish to
leave to do so in three to five years.
They rejected promises by Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, to
re-create the autonomous German homeland on the Volga river as amounting to
'an effective refusal to take effective measures to recreate German
autonomy'.
The three-day congress of Volga Germans in Moscow heard an appeal by Mr
Horst Waffenschmidt, the German state secretary for internal affairs, to
accept the offer of a new homeland in Russia.
'The door to Germany is still open,' he told the congress, 'but I must say
clearly and honestly that we can only accept a limited number of
immigrants.'
He was answered bluntly by Mr Heinrich Groth, chairman of the largest
organisation of Volga Germans, called Rebirth: 'All those who want to
emigrate, must be allowed to emigrate.'
Most of the Soviet Union's ethnic Germans were deported from the Volga
region and Ukraine to Siberia and Kazakhstan by Stalin during the war. The
slim chance that, in the present chaotic situation in Russia, they might be
persuaded to resettle rather than opt for their constitutional right to
return to Germany, seems now to have been undermined by Mr Yeltsin.
Although the Russian president promised in Bonn last year to re-establish
the Volga republic, the reality seems decidedly unattractive. On a
subsequent trip to Saratov, former capital of the Volga republic, he
proposed resettling the community on the abandoned missile-testing site at
Kapustin Yar - a clear sop to local Russian fears.
The prospect of mass immigration of anything up to 2m Volga Germans, many of
whose ancestors came to Russia up to 200 years ago, is one which fills the
authorities in Bonn with alarm.
The issue of asylum seekers in Germany, arriving in the country at more than
30,000 a month, is already causing political and social problems. The German
authorities are extremely anxious not to see that immigration issue mixed up
with the sensitive question of allowing ethnic Germans to return, which is
enshrined in the constitution.
The country has seen a flood of Germans returning, initially from eastern
Europe and increasingly from the former Soviet Union. Between 1989 and 1991
there were almost 1m, although the number fell from a peak of more than
397,000 in 1990 to almost 222,000 last year.
Mr Waffenschmidt's brief is to offer substantial German government
investment wherever the emigre communities can be persuaded to stay where
they are.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Maxwell widow foots son's legal bills
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES and BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS ELIZABETH Maxwell, widow of the late Robert Maxwell, who last month
described herself as 'destitute', is the mystery benefactor helping to pay
their son Kevin's legal bills.
Her identity was disclosed in the Court of Appeal yesterday. The provisional
liquidators of Bishopsgate Investment Management, which managed the pension
funds of Maxwell companies, tried unsuccessfully to have her made 'jointly
and severally' liable with Kevin for BIM's legal costs.
Mr John Brisby, counsel for the liquidators, said Mrs Maxwell had provided
Pounds 900,000 'at the drop of a hat' to Mr Kevin Maxwell and his brother
Ian.
The costs related to Mr Kevin Maxwell's unsuccessful plea that he had a
right to remain silent in response to questions from the liquidators about
some Pounds 450m of missing pension money to avoid self-incrimination.
Lord Justice Dillon said that, according to Mrs Maxwell, around December 11,
five weeks after her husband's death, Kevin asked her for Pounds 100,000
towards his legal fees. On December 16, Kevin and Ian asked for a further
Pounds 400,000 each for legal fees. There could, the judge said, be no
objection to a mother giving her son money for legal expenses.
'Naturally, in view of the circumstances which have come to public notice
since the death of Mr Robert Maxwell, there must be some suspicion that
money in the hands of the Maxwell family may have been taken improperly by
Mr Robert Maxwell from funds or companies with which he was associated.,' he
said.
But the judge concluded that there was no evidence that the money used by
Mrs Maxwell to pay her sons' bills was derived from Bishopsgate or was not
genuinely hers.
The first part of her contribution came in the form of almost FFr1m (Pounds
100,000) and later another sum of nearly Pounds 400,000.
In a magazine interview last month, Mrs Maxwell was reported as saying: 'I
haven't salted away anything, because I never for a minute believed that
he'd leave me destitute.'
A spokeswoman for D J Freeman, the London solicitors representing Mrs
Maxwell, declined yesterday to comment on her assets.
Mrs Maxwell, 71, was born Elizabeth Meynard near Lyons. She comes from a
wealthy family which owned several silk factories in the 1930s. Her father,
who became a legal consultant, at one point specialised in uncovering fraud
in the fruit and vegetable market at Les Halles in Paris.
It is understood that she brought Paris property and others assets to the
marriage. Some of the property is occupied by Maxwell companies, but it is
not known if she retains the title to these assets.
She has also owned for several years a chateau in Montagnac-sur-Lede in the
Lot-et-Garonne region. It is estimated to be worth Pounds 3m and has a
swimming pool, outdoor whirlpool bath and helicopter pad. It has eight
bedrooms, four bathrooms and two kitchens.
She may be able to earn further money - publishers have approached her for
her memoirs. It is clear, however, that paying for her son's legal bills
will make a considerable hole in her assets.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Iraq bows to UN pressure to scrap Scud equipment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ BOWED to United Nations pressure yesterday by agreeing to destroy
manufacturing equipment related to its Scud missile programme in an effort
to defuse the threat of possible military action to enforce UN resolutions.
The move was welcomed by Mr Rolf Ekeus, director of the UN special
commission charged with eliminating Iraq's weapons of mass destruction, as
indicating a new willingness in Baghdad to comply with UN demands. He called
the Iraqi decision a 'change of policy'.
British officials said cautiously yesterday that the Iraqi agreement to
destroy the Scud equipment was 'one of the benchmarks' they were seeking as
indicating Iraq's willingness to comply with UN demands.
Mr Ekeus told a New York news conference his commission was 'satisfied there
are undertakings that the Iraqis are willing to go along with destruction
(of) capabilities' which they had not previously been willing to destroy.
The Iraqi assurances were contained in a letter handed to Mr Ekeus yesterday
by Mr Abdul Amir al-Anbari, Baghdad's ambassador to the UN.
Iraqi officials originally refused to destroy the Scud-related equipment,
which was discovered by a team of UN ballistics inspectors in the vicinity
of Baghdad last month.
The refusal prompted the UN Security Council to warn of 'serious
consequences' if Iraq did not comply fully with Gulf war ceasefire
resolutions ordering the destruction of its conventional, chemical and
nuclear weapons programmes. At the same time the US issued a series of
warnings that a further military strike might be launched against Iraq.
The message was drummed home to Mr Tariq Aziz, Iraq's deputy prime minister,
in person last week during his delegation's appearance before the UN
Security Council. It has been backed up by reports that the US had drawn up
a list of targets in Iraq for a possible bombing raid.
Yesterday's letter to the UN is the first sign that Iraq is prepared to
respond to the Security Council's warnings. In a further sign of Iraqi
acquiescence, Mr Ekeus said Baghdad had also supplied him with 'important
new information' about its ballistic and chemical weapons programmes.
He said the Iraqi letter included a claim that Baghdad had itself destroyed
hundreds of missiles not previously declared to the UN inspectors. Although
Iraq was thought to have up to 800 Scud missiles, inspectors have so far
discovered and destroyed only 62.
The letter also contained Iraqi agreement to offer 'full, final and
complete' disclosure of its weapons programmes, Mr Ekeus said. A fresh team
of UN ballistics inspectors, due to arrive in Baghdad today, will verify the
Iraqi information.
The next big test of strength will probably be on nuclear weapons-related
equipment at a plant at Al-Atheer, south of Baghdad. A further team of
nuclear inspectors is to visit the country early next month.
The International Atomic Energy Commission in Vienna is expected to make
recommendations soon on what should be destroyed in the plant, left
untouched during the Gulf war.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Bus group to run passenger service on BR trains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAGECOACH, Britain's biggest private bus operator, is to become the first
company to operate a regular passenger service on British Rail. It will
charter two carriages from InterCity on overnight trains between Scotland
and London.
The Perth-based company aims to develop a market among people who would not
normally travel by InterCity trains.
It will promote the service in Scotland and charge fares below InterCity's
standard single and return rates. The service starts with the introduction
of British Rail's summer timetable on May 10.
The two carriages, containing 115 seats and decorated in the company's
livery of white with blue, yellow and red stripes, will be attached to a
regular night train which travels from Aberdeen, Dundee and Edinburgh to
London.
Stagecoach will operate a free coach service taking passengers from
Inverness, Aviemore and Perth to join the train at Edinburgh.
InterCity says it will receive a guaranteed income from Stagecoach. The deal
means that seated accommodation on the night train from Aberdeen to London
will be retained. It was to have been dropped with the introduction of the
new timetable on May 10, leaving only sleeper accom-modation.
Stagecoach staff will travel on the trains and will serve hot meals.
Tickets for the Stagecoach service will be available from British Rail, bus
stations and travel agents.
Mr Brian Souter, chairman of Stagecoach, has said he would like to run his
own trains on InterCity tracks, although this is prohibited by existing
legislation. He said yesterday this idea was 'still a possibility for the
future'.
Stagecoach dropped its coach service between Scotland and London 2 1/2 years
ago because its reliability was impaired by traffic congestion on the
English motorways.
Mr Chris Green, managing director of InterCity, said that the deal was 'a
classic case of a joint venture between InterCity and the private sector'.
British Rail says it is the first time a private company has operated
passenger train services on a regular basis, although BR frequently charters
trains to outside organisations on a one-off basis.
Stagecoach is the most aggressive and successful of the private bus
companies which have sprung up since the bus industry was deregulated in the
1980s. It operates in many parts of Scotland and owns bus companies in
Hampshire and the north of England.
It is involved in running bus services in Malawi, Kenya and Canada, and has
a stake in a joint venture in Hong Kong for leasing buses to China. It had
sales of about Pounds 100m in 1990.

FT  21 MAR 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow edges higher in heavy
early volume
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
WITH a 'triple witching' hanging over the US stockmarket yesterday, share
prices edged slightly higher during most of the trading session, before
jumping sharply in the final half-hour, writes Nikki Tait in New York.
The upward trend persisted throughout most of the day, the market's only
modest retreat coming in a brief period after lunch. Volumes were moderately
heavy for the day although dealers suggested that a burst of business
occured when the market opened and again in the final hour's trading. Many
investors were expected to remain on the sidelines until the potentially
volatile session was over.
By the 4pm close, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 14.99 points on
the previous night's close, at 3276.39. The more broadly-based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 Index gained 1.45 points to 411.25.
However, the Nasdaq index, which measures the over-the-counter market, eased
by 1.68 points to 624.28.
On the New York Stock Exchange, advancing stocks outpaced declining ones by
a margin of approximately three to two on volume of 246.7m shares.
AT&amp;T, the large US telecommunications group, was among the most active
shares traded during the morning session. They gained  3/4 to Dollars 40 5/8
, on confirmation of a Dollars 1.4bn contract from the US Internal Revenue
Service for computer equipment and services. The contract was awarded to the
company in July, but the decision ran into controversy.
Also rising sharply were shares in Allied Signal, up Dollars 2 7/8 to
Dollars 52 1/4 . The company said it expected first quarter earnings of 85
cents a share, some 15 to 20 cents higher than analysts' had been
predicting.
Allied Signal said reasons for the better-than-expected figures lay partly
in an accelerated restructuring programme, and partly in relatively strong
sales in the automotive aftermarket. It did warn, however, that it was too
early to say whether this would be maintained throughout 1992.
A couple of US car companies enjoyed useful gains in the morning, shares in
Ford gaining  3/8 to Dollars 40 1/2 and General Motors rising  3/4 to
Dollars 39 1/8 . Only Chrysler, weakest of the 'Big Three' Detroit
manufacturers, eased back - by  1/2 to Dollars 17 7/8 . Analysts at
Painewebber, the Wall Street brokerage, were said to have raised their
earnings estimates for the industry.
Canada
TORONTO SHARE prices strayed little from yesterday"s close, leaving the
index with a slight loss on the week.
The composite index edged up 3.22 points to close at 3,469.95, off 5.84
points on the week. Volume was 29.97m shares against 28.138m the day before.
The transportation sub-group led the gainers with a 1.20 per cent climb on
index, and financial services, mining and industrial products posted smaller
gains. Energy and consumer products were off moderately.
PWA Corp, the day's most active issue, rallied 0.30 to 5 1/4 on PWA's
announcement that it was discussing a strategic partnership with American
Airlines.

by Thyssen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THYSSEN, the German steel and engineering group, expects profits to show a
further decline this financial year to September 30, 1992, Mr Heinz Kriwet,
the chief executive, told yesterday's annual meeting.
World economic conditions had become even more difficult than last year,
while west Germany was experiencing a slowdown after its longest upturn
ever, he said.
While there were signs of a pick-up in east Germany, where Thyssen last year
achieved 3 per cent of turnover, this recovery was still very patchy.
Mr Kriwet took solace in the fact that other companies in the same sectors
were doing even worse than Thyssen, which last year suffered a drop of 25
per cent in net profit to DM520m (Dollars 315m) on turnover which edged up
by 1 per cent to DM37bn. It is holding its dividend at DM10 a share.
In the first five months of 1991-1992, Thyssen's turnover was 1 per cent
higher at around DM15bn, with the order inflow 4 per cent higher. However,
Mr Kriwet said these figures had been influenced by some large orders.
Because of the short-term nature of the steel and special steels business,
as well as some of the group's trading activities, it was not possible to
give a reliable estimate of this year's profits.
But he said: 'The annual result will very probably be markedly lower than in
the past financial year.'

venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BEKAERT, the Belgian producer of steel cord and wire, believes it could
raise more than BFr15bn (Dollars 435m) through the sale of a 49 per cent
stake in its Japanese joint venture Bridgestone-Bekaert Steel Cord  - three
times the book value of the holding.
Bekaert announced yesterday that it was bowing to pressure from its other
tyre-making customers and ending its 22-year-old joint venture with
Bridgestone Corporation, the Japanese tyre manufacturer.
Bridgestone-Bekaert, which generates profit of Y5bn annually on turnover of
Y40bn, makes steel cord for rubber reinforcement and sells about 80 per cent
of its production in Japan.
Mr Willy Snaet, a Bekaert vice-president, said yesterday: 'When Bridgestone
decided to take over Firestone (the US tyre manufacturer) recently, it moved
from being local to international and the relationship we had was
jeopardising our relationship with other customers.'
'It's a sign of the problems that they have in such a concentrated
industry,' added Mr Sebastian Scotney, a Belgian market analyst with Dillon
Read of London.
Bridgestone-Bekaert will become an independent company and Bekaert's shares
will gradually be sold to new investors on the Tokyo OTC market during 1993.
Mr Snaet said the Belgian group would probably not retain a stake in the
joint venture.
The Bridgestone-Bekaert stake is valued in Bekaert's net consolidated
accounts at just over BFr5bn. Although he stressed that the value would
depend on stock market conditions, Mr Snaet estimated that given the high
price-earnings ratios on the Tokyo market, the whole company could be worth
between BFr30bn and BFr36bn.
Analysts said such estimates should be treated with caution. They also
pointed out that some of the proceeds would have to offset the unspecified
cost to Bekaert of buying its outstanding minority stake in Bekaert
Dyersburg Steel Cord - a US subsidiary which was partly owned by
Bridgestone-Bekaert - in a deal announced last October.
On Monday, Bekaert is expected to announce a net consolidated loss for 1991
following another difficult year, and may only just cover its dividend
payout with earnings.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ELSEVIER, the Dutch publisher, reported a 20 per cent rise in 1991 trading
profit and forecast a rise in both net and operating profit in 1992, writes
Ronald van de Krol in Amsterdam.
Trading profit, which does not include contributions from associated
companies or interest income, totalled Fl 466.3m (Dollars 249.3m), compared
with Fl 387.5m in 1990.
Net profit fell to Fl 384.8m from Fl 506.9m the year before, when results
were swollen by extraordinary gains from Elsevier's sale of a 33 per cent
stake in fellow Dutch publisher Wolters Kluwer. Operating profit, as earlier
predicted by the company, was up 11 per cent at Fl 380.3m.
Net turnover rose by 10.6 per cent to Fl 2.27bn.
Elsevier said it would raise its 1991 dividend by Fl 0.15 to Fl 2.25. It
forecast that net profit will grow by a minimum of 25 per cent in 1992.
The company said its purchase in 1991 of Pergamon, the UK-based scientific
publisher, from Maxwell Communication Corp was a significant factor behind
last year's profit gains.
Another major event in 1991 was the disposal of its minority
cross-shareholding with Pearson, the UK publishing and banking group which
owns the Financial Times.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Learning how to mix it
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The faltering start to Mr John Major's campaign was accidentally highlighted
in a comment after his unusually aggressive speech at the rally in
Manchester on Thursday night. According to an aide, the prime minister said
it was the first time in 16 months that he had said what he felt.
Quite apart from the admission that he had not really hit his stride until
some days into the campaign, the comment points to a fundamental change of
strategy.
An earlier plan was for Mr Major to be above the political fray in a
statesmanlike fashion, leaving the negative campaigning on Labour to those
without quite such nice smiles.
But the speech on Thursday showed that Mr Major is prepared to mix it with
the opposition.
His speech did indeed, as he was at pains to point out, cover education,
housing and the Citizen's Charter.
It dealt more passionately - and to more applause - with Labour's tax plans,
the last Labour government's continuation of a 'forelock society', and the
unfitness of Labour to govern because of its stand on defence and,
implicitly, the putative hot-headedness of its leader.
The speech acquired lift-off with Mr Major's delivery. This was enlivened by
his encounter with a jostling group of demonstrators as he tried to do a
walkabout in Bolton on Thursday afternoon. He abandoned his usual monochrome
style for a note of passion, and his normal bureaucratic turn of phrase to
denounce 'the ugly face of Labour that I hate'.
There is a clear downside to television pictures showing a leader being the
focus of a hostile protest. For someone against whom one of the main charges
is blandness, there is a brighter side as well.
And the Tory tour party is in the business of being positive, after a week
which began flatly, as the economic output figures hijacked Tuesday's
campaigning, and unemployment dominated much of Thursday's.
Among the hopeful signs is the belief that the worst of the economic
indicators have already come out.
Most hopes are pinned on the new 'bite' in Mr Major's setpiece campaigning.
The prime minister still seems nice rather than Churchillian to the few
innocent bystanders he meets on tour, but he has at least shown that being
pleasant is not incompatible with behaving and sounding as though he really
does not want Labour to win.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Paddy Ashdown, in his dashes this week across the UK, has tried to set a
distinct agenda for the Liberal Democrats. But he has yet to generate a
sense that third-party politics has regained momentum.
He has been the most accessible of the party leaders, with less to lose from
the unscripted remark and the most to gain from a confrontation that sparks
publicity - such as yesterday's with Militant extremists, amid the municipal
drabness of council flats in Liverpool.
Party managers have restricted doorstep interviews by journalists, but Mr
Ashdown has not refused to answer questions from voters - sometimes against
his aides' advice. His first rally, at a Birmingham school on Thursday, was
to an open rather than invited audience. Afterwards he admitted to wishing
for a heckler or two.
Liberal Democrats claimed early successes in raising the issues of a
televised leaders' debate and constitutional reform. However, perhaps
because of his tactics, Mr Ashdown's topics have been overshadowed in the
media by those chosen by Mr Kinnock, Mr Major and news editors.
He has adapted his programme to respond to the issue of the day. Yesterday,
for example, he linked his reaction to the inflation figures with the
subject of housing by citing appalling inner-city accommodation as the cost
of the government's struggle against price increases. But his main theme has
often been left on the floor of the television cutting room.
Mr Ashdown has set the pace for leadership tours, with a frenetic schedule
that will take him to every part of Great Britain, and to some areas more
than once. As the party's most televisual asset, he has rarely stayed in one
place for more than an hour.
His campaign style has combined characteristics of the two main leaders.
Like Mr Kinnock he has been at ease with the multitude, talking with
furrowed brow to the unemployed or elderly, or racing through shopping
precincts, hands held high, proclaiming: 'Good day, my friend.' Like Mr
Major he has sometimes preferred more intimate sessions, gathering groups of
businessmen or local activists and engaging in a brief seminar on, for
example, the uniform business rate.
Party strategists are content that the Liberal Democrats have not dipped in
the opinion polls and may have advanced a point or two. But so far it seems
unlikely that there will be much increase in the party's 22 MPs.

FT  21 MAR 92 / A hint of swagger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Neil Kinnock looks and acts like a 'dead cert' winner - just as he did in
1987.
This time, however, the Labour leader and his fiercely protective entourage
sniff triumph in the electoral breeze. They are acting accordingly.
Motorcades with security back-up, fanfares, spotlights and VIP reception
committees help create the impression that, after nine shadow years, Mr
Kinnock is emerging into the light as the man of the moment.
Hands held at holster level suggest a hint of the victor's swagger and the
matey grin which sparks fury or affection remains broad, though Mr Kinnock
is too scarred by experience to believe the battle is won.
A spontaneous, cheek-kissing intimacy still breaks out from the calculated
sobriety intended to show that here is a serious man up to serious job. His
toe-caps sparkle but you just know he prefers trainers.
The choreographers of a highly professional campaign have left very little
to chance. That means limiting the opportunities for mistakes - there were
none on the road in the first week - and maximising exposure for the party
leader on terms dictated by a team dedicated to showing Mr Kinnock's best
side.
Secrecy surrounds every step of the way, partly because of security but also
to ensure the Tories do not second-guess Labour's day-to-day campaign. There
is, however, barely concealed delight within the leader's camp at keeping
the press guessing, a game which helps create an essential aura of
importance.
The strategy can go too far. On Thursday, the pack set off for Birmingham.
Asked by a journalist on board the battle bus if she knew the day's
destination, the press officer merely replied 'yes'. The inquirer responded:
'Then you'd better tell the driver because no one's told him.'
In 1987, Labour made it clear it believed the election would be fought in
front of the masses on television and asked why it should assist a largely
hostile written press with comparatively little influence. The party had a
good point then and has a good point now.
So far, contact with unvetted voters has been strictly limited and will
remain so; when it is attempted, the public in any case risks being
flattened by a moving mountain of broadcasting technology upon which the
entire, bizarre exercise depends.

FT  21 MAR 92 / The judgments of conviction: The state of play between Tory
and Labour at the end of the first week
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Conservative tax onslaught would stop Mr Neil Kinnock in his tracks. The
judgment of one of Mr John Major's senior lieutenants was offered with as
much confident aggression as anyone could muster after a week without sleep.
The clever but incomplete arithmetic of Mr John Smith's shadow Budget had
left scope for his party to tap a rich vein of public unease about higher
taxes.
But, like others with the prime minister at Conservative Central Office
yesterday, he did not grasp the admission of weakness implicit in the
assessment. It was an acknowledgement that after the first week of
campaigning, the Conservatives have found themselves in the role of the
opposition. Behind in the polls, it is no longer enough for Mr Major to stop
Mr Kinnock. He must drive him back.
Labour has to do no more than hold its present standing in the opinion polls
to force Mr Major from Downing Street. A share of just over 40 per cent of
the vote would not give him an overall majority, but there would be no doubt
that Mr Kinnock had won the election.
That could change. The polls have been volatile. Labour's lead is at best
two points. Mr Paddy Ashdown's Liberal Democrats, sidelined by the
cross-fire, might yet emerge as a more serious rival for the votes of
disaffected Conservatives. Mr Major's offensive against Mr Smith's tax plans
has yet to permeate fully the voters' consciousness.
So Labour's strategists in Walworth Road are looking ahead to the clutch of
opinion polls tomorrow with as much anxious anticipation as those in Smith
Square.
But this week's campaign snapshots have been ones for Mr Kinnock to keep.
Gloomy output and unemployment figures did nothing to still resentment over
the government's handling of the economy. The economic indicators were
'truly awful', one cabinet minister admitted in an unguarded moment.
There were pluses, he insisted. On the doorsteps Mr Major won almost
universal praise, Mr Kinnock attracted uniform scorn. The voters feared the
opposition more than they wanted to punish the government.
The minster's Labour counterparts told a different story. After 13 years the
voters were saying that they had had enough. Recession, the poll tax and
crumbling public services had persuaded them it was time for change.
Both judgments carried conviction. But the lines of fatigue which come with
18-hour days concealed puzzled frowns on Conservative faces and cautious
confidence on Labour ones. Mr Kinnock has the look of a politician who
believes that at last he can win. Mr Major, with no experience of
opposition, has the air of one who has realised how hard he must fight not
to lose.
It was Mr Smith who gave Labour the first round. Described dolefully by one
opponent as 'a priceless asset', the shadow chancellor's mock budget was
delivered with an articulate gravitas which obscured for several days the
questions it failed to answer. Aides insisted that the package - reconciling
commitments to spend more on the welfare state with pledges not to raise
taxes for the average family - worked superbly. The skilled working classes
had been reassured and the confusion and contradictions of 1987 could now be
avoided.
Mr Major did not have a bad week. A stylish portrayal of the journey from
Brixton's Coldharbour Lane to 10 Downing Street in his first election
broadcast reinforced the image of a politician close to voters' anxieties
and aspirations.
The message on the doorsteps - grudgingly admitted by Labour MPs - was that
the prime minister is liked and trusted. He attracts little of the blame for
his party's mistakes and credit for shaving the rougher edges from
Thatcherism.
But circumstances have now forced him into a different role. His lengthy
election manifesto - designed above all to underpin the message that here
was a prime minister seeking a first term rather than a party seeking a
fourth term - was put to one side within 24 hours of its launch on
Wednesday.
The party's strategists decided that Mr Major, until now above the election
slanging match, was needed in the front line of the attack on Labour's tax
policies. So instead of spending the rest of the week setting out his own
agenda, Mr Major took on the less familiar role - and more colourful
language - of negative campaigning.
It is not a role into which he slips easily. Nor one that will necessary
appeal to a public weaned on 'that nice Mr Major'. But after this week's
opinion poll wobbles, Conservative election strategy has crystallised behind
two central themes: tax and leadership.
Those hit by Mr Smith's plan to abolish the earnings ceiling on National
Insurance contributions do not, by definition, merit Mr Major's description
of 'middle-income' earners. Fewer than 15 per cent of taxpayers earn more
than Pounds 22,000. But in the crucial marginals of London and the
south-east enough of them to make a difference to the election outcome may
earn (or aspire to earn) that amount.
So Mr Major, as he promised, will go on, and on, and on about Labour's
threat to the incomes of the upwardly mobile. He will intersperse that with
thinly veiled attacks on this rival. Mr Michael Heseltine's approach will be
less diplomatic in what is being billed as a strategy to 'shred' Labour's
tax plans and Mr Kinnock's leadership.
The Conservatives insist it will work: that neither Mr Smith's Budget nor Mr
Kinnock's character will survive the next two weeks; that Mr Major will
become the first prime minister since opinion polls began to lift support
during a campaign.
Perhaps. But Labour too has an agenda - the recession, health, education and
the poll tax - which strikes powerful chords with the voters. For all the
sound and fury over tax, these have been the issues scoring the highest
marks for 'salience' in the opinion polls. This week it has been Mr
Kinnock's 'time for change' rather than Mr Major's 'you can't trust Labour'
which has had resonance.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Leading Article: Labour's tax error
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THERE is little to separate the main parties in their overall economic
stance, the same cannot be said for personal taxation policy. Now that both
parties have published detailed budget plans, voters can choose between two
clearly diverging approaches on taxation.
Whichever party wins the election, most employees will continue to pay tax
at a marginal rate of 34 per cent: income tax at 25 per cent, plus 9 per
cent national insurance contributions (NICs). If the Conservatives are
re-elected, the top rate of tax on income and capital gains will remain at
40 per cent, at the bottom of the range for EC countries.
This structure was put in place by Mr Nigel Lawson's 1988 budget and has
created a simpler and more transparent tax system. Distortions have been
reduced by eroding the differences between the tax treatment of income and
capital gains and between corporation tax and income tax. Together with the
gradual elimination of many tax breaks, the ground has been greatly cut from
under the tax avoidance industry.
It is a pity that nothing has been done to remove the dip in marginal rates
from 34 per cent to 25 per cent at the Pounds 21,060 upper earnings limit
for NICs. And the chancellor's proposal for a new lower rate income tax band
of 20 per cent, while it may have seemed politically astute, will yield
small benefits for taxpayers on low incomes while creating an administrative
tangle. If he wants to help those on low incomes, Mr Lamont should steal
Labour's clothes and replace the 20 per cent band with higher personal
allowances.
Sharp change
However, the Conservatives deserve credit for having modernised and
streamlined the UK tax system since 1979. Labour, in contrast, would
introduce a sharp change of direction, with a significantly redistributive
programme which requires a return to much higher marginal rates. To raise
almost Pounds 5bn of additional revenue, an additional 50 per cent tax rate
would be introduced on earnings in excess of Pounds 40,000 a year, and the
NIC upper earnings limit would be removed. This effectively adds another 9
per cent tax to all earnings over the limit. For employees, there would be
three tax rates: 34 per cent on taxable income up to Pounds 23,700; 49 per
cent on taxable income between Pounds 23,700 and Pounds 36,375; and 59 per
cent on the rest.
A top rate of 59 per cent is not so very different from those charged in
comparable countries. And even in the UK, the top rate of tax was 60 per
cent until 1988. Although comparisons are difficult, it is broadly true that
for most families the higher rates would bite at lower income levels than in
Germany and France; for single people the reverse is true. For married
taxpayers the new top rate of 59 per cent would also bite earlier than in
the 1970s when Mr Denis Healey squeezed the rich. There would be far fewer
of the exemptions and tax breaks which made Mr Healey's even higher tax
rates largely fictional.
Salary inflation
The Conservatives will rightly make much of the impact of such an increase
in taxation. While there are arguments about the impact on incentives, a
higher tax regime will not encourage an enterprise culture. Salary inflation
is inevitable. And the effect of such tax rises on the budgets of the 17 per
cent of households which would face them would be very painful. It is
inconceivable that this would not have a delaying effect on economic
recovery - especially in the already depressed housing market.
The purpose of the shadow budget was to defuse what the Conservatives have
dubbed 'Labour's tax bombshell' - the fear among voters that Labour would
put up taxes across the board. By demonstrating to the majority that they
have nothing to fear from a Labour government, it may have done the trick.
But as the details sink in throughout the more affluent areas where it will
bite hardest, the increases could deny Labour victory in key marginals. The
proposals do, after all, offer a strong incentive to a quarter of voters in
London and the south-east not to vote Labour. If that happens, Mr Smith's
tax gamble will have failed, and Labour will pay the price for its
misjudgment.
Labour's strategists would be wise to think beyond such immediate electoral
considerations. There is an implicit contract between government and
taxpayers that sudden, large increases in taxation should be avoided. A
blind spot on this point led to the poll tax blunder. Labour appeared to
recognise the argument in its policy review documents, when it promised that
tax changes would be introduced in ways which did not disrupt household
budgets. Mr Kinnock still has time to fulfil that pledge. If he fails to do
this, wavering voters will conclude that he should not be the next prime
minister.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Viewers left cold by heated polemic - Paul
Cheeseright pays his second visit to the Martins, a family in the west
Midlands. When the campaign started, they had not decided who they would
vote for
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST week of the campaign has done nothing to clarify the issues and
the Martins one way or the other. If anything, the question has been made
more complicated by the heat of polemics and by the rush of contrary
promises.
But the parties' portrayal of themselves and their personalities through
television has been reaching Lyn and Tony and their son Russell, who is
voting for the first time.
The Liberal Democrats' attempt to push Mr Ashdown forward as a civilising
political influence clearly attracted Russell. 'He's the thinking man's
politician.' And Mr Major has come across just as intended: the man who
somehow understands. 'I like the man because he's been there and done it.
He's seen life on the streets,' said Russell.
Yet they like Mr Kinnock more than previously. 'Neil Kinnock has changed his
image in the last few days', said Tony. 'He got a bad press early on. He's
mellowed his attitude.'
'He's talking to you instead of at you,' noted Lyn, with implied approval of
the pitch that the party is not just Neil, but Neil heading the team.
And because the Martins want to be talked to, to be reasoned with, they are
getting pretty fed up with the hectoring of the campaign. 'Some of the
programmes that have been on the TV. Ridiculous,' snorted Tony. 'They're
just slagging each other off.'
'All one is concerned about is knocking the other one,' added Lyn, with
particular reference to the televised confrontation between Mr Roy
Hattersley and Mr Michael Howard on Central TV last Monday, with Mr Tom
McNally of the Liberal Democrats stuck in the middle.
Monday was also the day of Labour's alternative Budget. The Martins had been
dismissive of Mr Lamont's real one and they were not much more complimentary
about Mr Smith's effort. 'Both parties are doing something about the taxes,'
Lyn acknowledged. But, comparing the two, 'there wasn't a lot in it as to
how it would work out for us'.
That is largely because, with a gross income of around Pounds 20,000 between
them, Lyn and Tony are neither poor enough nor rich enough to be much
affected by tinkering with the tax of either the low-paid or the high-paid.
Russell, though, likes Labour's plan for 50 per cent tax on incomes over
Pounds 40,000. 'That is a really good idea. It helps even things out a bit.'
By Thursday, the concern of the Martins had swung back to schools, if only
because they spent the evening at a parent-teacher meeting on behalf of
Westley, 14, their second son. He goes to Lyndon School in Solihull. Lyn and
Tony are very happy with both Lyndon and St Margaret's Church of England
Primary where, Keeley, 10, their daughter goes.
This means they are ambivalent about the changes Conservative policy might
bring about. They have no problems about the core curriculum and enthuse
about spending more on education. But opting out is more difficult.
'If they did want to abolish local education authorities, they'd still have
to have a group to manage the schools which are left,' said Lyn.
All of which bore out the general point that, as Lyn said, 'each party has a
good point or a few good points.' And that led Tony to conclude, 'I think
it's going to be close.'

FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Labour tax plans 'compete with EC'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE STATISTICAL battle over rival tax regimes rests on complex and highly
contentious foundations.
Comparisons of international tax systems, and even of the British fiscal
regime at different points in history, involve assumptions about individual
and family circumstances.
The UK tax system looks simple when compared with the complicated structure
of tax and social-security contributions in France and Germany. Moreover,
internationally comparable and up-to-date figures on incomes earned or taxes
paid are hard to find.
The chart alongside is based on statistics from the Organisation for
Economic Co-operation and Development and FT calculations about the effects
of Labour's shadow Budget. The figures in the lower chart are based on the
marginal tax and social security liabilities of a single person in France,
Germany and the UK.
Labour's plan to increase marginal tax rates for high income earners would
still leave most single British tax-payers facing lower marginal tax rates
than in either Germany or France. However, under the Conservatives, the top
rate tax-payers will face substantially lower marginal tax rates than in
Britain's main European competitors.
These comparisons ignore the complications introduced by married couple and
child tax allowances. The combination of these allowances would reduce the
marginal tax rate faced by families in France and Germany compared to those
shown here.
Marginal tax rates, the amount of tax paid on each additional slice of
income earned, are usually plotted against money income. A better way to
make international comparisons of the tax burden is to show the marginal tax
rate facing each income decile from the poorest 10 per cent to the highest
10 per cent.
The top 50 per cent of single French tax-payers all currently face a higher
marginal tax rate than would confront upper income earners under Labour's
plans. Only the top 20 per cent of British tax-payers would face a higher
marginal rate than the same group in Germany under Labour's plans.
Labour's tax plans, the Tories argue, will heap a heavy proportion of the
tax burden on middle and upper income tax payers. Nearly all of the top 50
per cent of wage earners will face a higher marginal rate than at present.
Yet most single French and German upper income earners, and almost all lower
income earners in these countries, face higher marginal tax rates than would
be the case under either a Labour or a Conservative government.
The remaining charts provide a historical perspective on the current debate.
The UK, compared to France and Germany, has been relatively lightly taxed
throughout the 1980s. The total UK tax burden as a percentage of GDP was 40
per cent in 1990, marginally higher than in 1980 - the Tories' first full
year in office.
For much of the 1980s the personal income tax burden was more evenly shared
in the UK than elsewhere in Europe. In 1987, the richest 10 per cent of UK
households paid 43.4 per cent of total direct taxation comparted to 53 per
cent in Germany and 60 per cent in France.
It is clear from all these calculations that they do not support simple
political claims from either side. That is unlikely to prevent the
politicians using them in a debate which will probably remain at the centre
of the election campaign

German national pride came to the aid of Labour yesterday. Jubilant claims

Eschewing diplomatic convention an official could not resist tipping off
Walworth Road that it was 'inappropriate' to compare the two nations'
inflation rates because the figures were compiled differently. It would be
fairer, the official said to compare underlying inflation, which was running

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Belton House has finally got its silver back. When Mrs Thatcher became prime
minister, she was appalled at the poor quality of the porcelain and plate on
hand at Downing Street to service visiting world leaders. She coveted the
fabulous 18th century Brownlow silver, the pride of Belton House, an
ancestral seat close to her Grantham home.
Lord Brownlow was only too happy to oblige and loaned some of the service to
Number 10. Then, a few years later, he decided to become a tax exile and
sold up, with the National Trust acquiring both house and contents.
The trust was shy to ask Mrs Thatcher for its silver back, but once John
Major was installed in Downing Street there was no problem. He has
commissioned modern British crafted silver and was happy to return the
antiques.
The National Trust has discovered that the silver has been well used. When
the public gets to see the united collection from April 1, it will be easy
to spot the pieces off which the famous fed at No 10.

The Labour leader is down to appear in a United Nations rally at Westminster

A victorious Kinnock might have more pressing engagements on his hands. One
of his fellow speakers is scheduled to be Paddy Ashdown, who may also be
otherwise engaged - bargaining with Kinnock perhaps.
Michael Heseltine is billed to appear as well, but, unlike the others, he is

FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Sheridan does it from prison - Ballot Box
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There will not be a news conference to match that being staged on Monday by
Tommy Sheridan, the anti-poll tax campaigner standing for Glasgow Pollok.
Sheridan is holding it inside Saughton prison, Edinburgh, where he is
serving six months for breaching a court order.
The Representation of the People Act obliges the prison to give
parliamentary candidates in jail the same facilities as any other candidate,
so the TV cameras will be allowed in. Sheridan is also allowed to use a
mobile telephone and has some access to the prison fax machine to issue his
manifesto, which boasts of his record of 'standing up for the poor.' His
election agent is able to visit him in prison as often as he wants.
Sheridan is standing for Scottish Militant Labour, an offshoot of Militant,
and his backers say they are making headway in the bleak housing estates of
the safe Labour seat on the south side of Glasgow.
The 27-year-old candidate was jailed for breaching a court order banning him
from disrupting warrant sales - sales of the possessions of those who had
not paid the poll tax.
The last person to stand for parliament from prison, in 1981, was Bobby
Sands, the IRA hunger striker. Sheridan's supporters prefer the example of
John MacLean, a Red Clydesider who stood from Peterhead prison in 1918.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Tories scornful of rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANALYSTS at Conservative Central Office hit back at Labour's tax and
National Insurance blueprint yesterday with a scathing critique of the
impact of proposals laid out in the shadow Budget.
An eight-page Tory document - The Claims and the Reality - argues that those
who gain under Labour's proposals will benefit by a small amount, while many
middle-income families will lose. It says top rates of tax in other European
countries affect only those on very high incomes.
Mr Steve Webb of the Institute for Fiscal Studies said most of the Tory
claims were factual, though he added that the statistics in the document did
not give the whole picture.
The Tory paper ridicules the idea that Labour taxes would target just the
rich and suggests that many 'ordinary middle-income families' will suffer.
It quotes from the government's April 1991 New Earnings Survey figures,
which show that the proportion of the population earning over Pounds 360 per
week was 28.7 per cent in England as a whole, 38.4 per cent in the
south-east and 45.1 per cent in Greater London.
But these figures are for full-time adult working males, and do not take
women into account. The proportion of full-time working women earning over
Pounds 360 a week in Greater London, for example, is only 19.9 per cent.
Presenting the paper to a London news conference yesterday, Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, contrasted a 2p a week tax gain for most of those
who benefit from the Labour plan with 'millions of losers' who, he argued,
would pay 'through the nose.'
The Tories will press their argument in the coming weeks by illustrating the
impact of the tax proposals on individual taxpayers.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Covering up the tracks of privatisation - The
background to the Tory's change of heart over British Rail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH RAIL'S branch line to the Cornish fishing village of St Ives is a
poor advertisement for the Conservatives' record on the railways.
Granted, the 4 1/2 -mile spur off the London-Penzance main line at St Erth
scores highly on scenic merit as it rounds the bird sanctuary of Leland
Saltings to reveal a panoramic view of St Ives Bay. But the train that runs
on it is a museum piece. Comprising one rattling, rumbling, 35-year-old
railcar, it is quaintly described in BR-speak as one of its 'heritage'
trains. In anybody else's language, it is clapped out.
The once-bustling station at St Ives has been razed to make way for a car
park. There are no station staff, and the only shelter for passengers is a
rude hut - a description taken all too literally by those who have adopted
it as a public urinal.
These economies notwithstanding, the service loses money hand-over-fist. BR
will not say how much, but acknowledges that Britain's rural branch lines
rarely cover much more than a third of their costs. For the communities they
serve the fear of closure is never far away.
It is against this background that the Conservatives have backed down on
promises to privatise BR. Voters know that it is not just the branch lines
that lose money: for all BR's economies and productivity improvements, only
a handful of its busiest InterCity services turn in a profit. Talk of
privatisation is indivisible from fears that the private sector would
swiftly eliminate loss-makers.
Thus, after months of promising a white paper on BR's privatisation, the
election has obliged the Conservatives to retrench. Significantly, the
railways section of their manifesto published this week avoided any mention
of the word privatisation. Instead, it offered the rather less threatening
notion of franchising.
Under this scheme, the railways will remain in state ownership, but
private-sector operators will be allowed to run trains on BR tracks. They
will also be invited to bid for franchises to take over the operation of
existing BR services - or possibly groups of services, such as the old Great
Western Railway routes out of London Paddington.
The Conservatives emphasise that the idea is to increase the use of the
railways. Subsidies for loss-making services will continue to be provided
where necessary and 'arrangements to sustain the current national network of
services will be maintained'.
For the electorate, the promises may have come too late. Conversations with
passengers on a railway journey through the West Country suggest that the
privatisation of BR is an idea too closely associated with the Conservatives
for them to be able to shrug it off three weeks from an election.
On the 10.21 from Exeter St David's to Penzance, Mr Derek Fisher, a
self-employed photographer from Bristol, is as firmly convinced that the
Conservatives will privatise the railways as he is that it will be a
disaster. 'There would be 50 per cent less railway lines than we've got
now,' he says. 'All the branch lines would go, for a start, because people
would start looking at them from a monetary point of view.'
Mr Don Nowell, a civil engineering inspector from London, says: 'Something
has got to be done about the railways . . . but for the Conservatives to
hand them over to their friends for their personal gain is not the answer.
I'm nearly 65 now, so I remember the old days of the railways before
nationalisation, and I can tell that they were an absolute bloody shambles
compared with what we've got now.'
Sensitivities grow stronger as the train enters Cornwall. This far-flung
part of the country feels forgotten and ignored by Westminster and
Whitehall. With fishing and tin-mining long supplanted by tourism as the
area's most important industry, it sees good communications as crucial to
its economy.
The branch line to St Ives is a case in point. Its existence at this time of
year appears an absurdity. Yet in the summer the trains are packed with day
trippers.
Mrs Betty Oldbury, a retired teacher, says the railway is a lifeline for St
Ives - not just for tourists, but for local people. 'After all, we haven't
all got cars,' she says. 'People here are nervous about what the government
will do next.'
There is even greater anxiety over the Cornish main line. Passenger loadings
on the InterCity trains through the county are light outside the summer
season, and there is a strong suspicion that a profit-driven private-sector
operator would terminate trains at Plymouth, reducing the Cornish section to
branch line status.
Feelings run high on this issue. To sever the main line would be like sawing
Cornwall off and casting it adrift, say locals. Mr Peter Moore of Cornwall
County Council's surveyor's department says: 'It would cause a riot.'
Whether the fears are strong enough to influence an election is another
matter. 'Nothing that stopped the trains at Plymouth would get my vote,'
says Mr Martin Evans, a Truro solicitor. That may not be the uppermost
factor in his mind on April 9. But with three vulnerable seats to defend in
Cornwall, it is a risk the Conservatives could have done without.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Ashdown barracked by Militant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN, Liber-al Democrat leader, was jostled and barracked
yesterday by Militant sympathisers supporting Mr Terry Fields, who was
expelled from the Labour party but is defending Liverpool Broadgreen as an
independent.
Mr Ashdown - who was campaigning on housing policy in Liverpool - challenged
Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, to confront Militant.
Continuing the hectic pace he has set himself, Mr Ashdown said that bad
housing was a cost of the government's anti-inflation strategy.
'Anybody can bring inflation down by stopping the economy dead in its
tracks,' he said.
He called for councils' capital receipts to be freed in order to kickstart
the construction industry.
Mr Ashdown, who is thankful that his party has not been squeezed by Labour
or the Tories in the first week of the campaign, also called for an
independent central bank and for sterling to be moved to the narrow band of
the exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System in order to bear
down on inflation.
Later, at his official adoption meeting in his Yeovil constituency, Mr
Ashdown complained of the 'arrogance' of the Labour and Tory parties 'who
have spent these last weeks and months of their campaign not debating about
the future, but arguing about the past'.
He added: 'The Liberal Democrats are the only party in the election which
has recognised the seriousness of Britain's current situation. There is a
real danger that, under either of the two other parties, that situation
could well become catastrophic.'

SHARES that might gain from a Conservative win again dropped sharply
yesterday, while Labour gainers dropped by less than the market as a whole.
Conservative gainers - the shares of companies that might suffer from Labour
party policies - are now 6 percentage points below their announcement-day
level. Some have dropped much more: BET, the conglomerate, has fallen by 18
per cent since March 11, and National Power, the recently-privatised
generator, by 12 per cent.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Gould moves focus to poll-tax record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR opened up a new campaign battleground yesterday when it turned its
fire on the Conservatives' record on the poll tax.
At the same time Mr Bryan Gould, shadow environment secretary, unveiled the
party's 'fair rates' plans. He claimed that the average household in England
would pay Pounds 114 less under Labour than under the government's proposed
council tax.
Using the party's morning news conference to highlight the poll tax rates
for 1992-93, now being announced by local councils, Mr Neil Kinnock, Labour
leader, described the Tory party as 'the poll tax party.' He went on to
charge that Mr John Major, the prime minister, had claimed that he had been
'bounced' into backing the tax while arguing as recently as last Wednesday
that the principle behind it had been correct.
The Labour leader's attack was countered by Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, who said that Mr Kinnock's alternative 'fair rates'
plan conflicted with his claim in the 1980s that rates were the 'most unjust
of all taxes'. Mr Heseltine added that residents in Labour boroughs paid on
average Pounds 54 more than those living in Tory-controlled boroughs.
Mr Gould said that on Labour's calculations, the council tax, due to replace
the poll tax next year if the Conservatives are re-elected, would have
resulted in a bill of Pounds 504 for the average property in England had it
been in place for the 1992-93 financial year.
Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, argued that the
Pounds 114 saving - taking the average bill to Pounds 390 - would come
mainly from scrapping the single-person discounts payable under the
Conservatives' plans.
He estimated a saving of Pounds 53 from ending the discounts, plus an extra
Pounds 32 from savings in administering and collecting Labour's less complex
tax.
The other Pounds 29 would come from discarding the government's proposed
transitional relief scheme for those losing heavily from the change of tax.
'Poor widows will look on with amazement as single millionaires receive most
help under the Conservatives' proposed discounts,' said Mr Blunkett.
Labour's 'fair ates' require no system either for banding or for discounts.
The savings claimed by Labour depend on three assumptions: that the council
tax will require a register, that Labour would introduce 'fair rates'
without transitional relief, and that there would be no discounts for at
least the poorer single-person households.
Mr Heseltine has denied that the discounts would require a register. It is
also unlikely that Labour would introduce rates with no transitional relief
or rebates for single-person households. The real saving might, therefore,
be considerably less than Pounds 114.
However, Labour claims that its rebate system would be more generous for the
same cost as the government's.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Embarrassment for Lang at leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TORY campaign in Scotland suffered intense embarrassment yesterday when
Labour produced what appeared to be a letter from Mr Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary, to Mr John Major in which he spoke of using the Scottish National
party to split the Labour vote.
The letter, written on Scottish Office paper on March 3, also revealed
disagreement between Mr Lang and Mr Major over election tactics -
particularly over publication of a Scottish Office booklet.
The key passage in the letter reads: 'It is almost as important to us to
keep the SNP at bay as it is to use them to split the socialist vote.'
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, flourished the letter at a press
conference in Glasgow and said it showed that, although Mr Lang had always
claimed that preserving the union was his overriding aim, he was prepared to
gamble its future 'in a desperate attempt to contrive his political
survival'.
Mr Lang refused to comment on the letter. In it he argued for publication of
a booklet which Mr Major and Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, had
reservations about. It set out more authoritatively than before how much
money Scotland received from Westminster and how much it contributed in tax.
The booklet - prepared by Mr Lang - claimed that Scotland received
substantially higher expenditure per head than other parts of Britain, and
suggested that revenue raised in Scotland was about Pounds 4bn less than the
Pounds 22bn spent.
In the letter Mr Lang said he was 'disappointed' about Mr Major's
reservations on the booklet.
'We are engaged in a complex exercise to outflank three other parties,' he
said. 'This initiative could score against all of them.' He said it would be
difficult for Labour to discredit the booklet because it needed the
arguments to attack the SNP. The booklet would also help refute the SNP's
Budget proposals.
Mr Lang ends: 'So, with apologies for persisting on this occasion, I would
ask you to reconsider publication while there is still time.'
The booklet was published on March 9 at only a few hours notice. Membership
of the European Community would not be automatic or easy for an independent
Scotland, Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, warned yesterday.
'Scotland could not slide out of the United Kingdom on Monday and sidle into
the Community as the 13th member state on Tuesday,' he said.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: Swing seen in London marginals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR has achieved a 6 per cent swing in the crucial 21 London marginals
since 1987, according to an opinion poll published yesterday.
But the findings of the London Weekend Television Harris poll suggest that
the swing would give them only 12 of the 21 seats needed to help secure a
outright victory nationally.
The figures will, nonetheless, come as a significant boost to Labour's
London campaign, after reports last month that residual voter hostility to
perceived hard-left influence in the capital was holding back the party's
progress.
The poll, based on interviews on Tuesday and Wednesday with more than 800
voters, gave Labour 43 per cent, the Conservatives 40 per cent, the Liberal
Democrats 12 per cent, and others 6 per cent.
Labour's performance in the seven marginal outer London new towns targeted
by the party was particularly impressive, according to the poll. It
suggested there had been a 12 per cent swing in these towns since 1987
which, if accurate, would give Labour control of five of the seats. The poll
gave Labour 43 per cent, the Conservatives 41 per cent and the Liberal
Democrats 10 per cent.
The Labour party is putting in enormous campaigning efforts in London.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Election 1992: The week of the wise old owl - The triumphs
of John Smith, the shadow chancellor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS the moment when Labour's 1992 campaign revved its engines at the
start of the electoral runway and prepared for take off.
Everyone in that crowded Westminster lecture hall on Monday knew that a
single overlooked technical glitch in the shadow Budget could start the
party off with a potentially fatal belly-flop. Yet, under the scrutiny of
the sceptics, Mr John Smith's bird flew.
Seldom can an election campaign have depended quite so heavily on a single
event or the personality of a single individual. Yet with the economy, tax
and spending at the very core of the election, the shadow chancellor has
already proved an asset at least as crucial to Labour as Mr John Major is
said to be for the Tories.
This is not to say his Budget is flawless. Economists have criticised the
wisdom of its tax bands, its impact on the rich and not-so-rich and a number
of evasions in the fine print.
But the very fact that yesterday, five days after it was unveiled, the
Conservatives were promising to dedicate all their firepower - 'day after
day, on and on and on' as one campaigner put it - to discrediting its
prescriptions is a weighty tribute to its political acuity.
Alongside his frontbench colleagues, Mr Smith is a howitzer among airguns.
His stocky physique and owl-like features exude a confidence and power that
lend much-needed gravitas and morale to the entire Labour team. He is
comfortable with himself and appears wholly undaunted by the prospect of
taking on a post that has defeated so many.
Much has been written about the shadow chancellor's reassuring Scottish burr
and bank-manager demeanour. But his public image is now a critical component
in the campaign. No other member of Labour's shadow cabinet could have
delivered a shadow Budget that added to, not detracted from, Labour's
credibility.
If Mr Neil Kinnock pledges that Labour will not devalue the pound, he is
instantly doubted. If Mr Smith does so, he is at least given a serious
hearing.
When Mr Norman Lamont says Labour will put up taxes, interest rates and
inflation, and Tory posters argue 'You can't trust Labour', a camera shot of
Mr Smith's contemptuous disapproval is the Opposition's most effective
reply.
The FT-Mori poll of business attitudes this week showed that clear
majorities believed a Labour government would raise interest rates, devalue
the pound and put a brake on investment. Yet Mr Smith out-polled Mr Lamont
by 46 points to 39 points as likely to make the better chancellor.
That conundrum is hard to explain. One merchant banker suggested yesterday
that while some dislike Mr Smith's vocal championing of such
redistributionist policies as a national minimum wage, there is a conviction
in the City that he is, as Mrs Thatcher said of Mr Mikhail Gorbachev, 'a man
we can do business with'. There is less confidence, however, in the company
he keeps.
The MP for Monklands East has had plenty of time to hone his act. He has
been deployed, not just on the City's prawn cocktail circuit of boardroom
lunches, but in Europe, Japan and the US.
This week his lawyer's at radio and television audiences. In his Panorama
debate with Mr Lamont, he was widely credited with looking more convincing.
On party election broadcasts and throughout the campaign, he will be
systematically used to promote Labour's image as a government-in-waiting.
If Mr Kinnock fails to cross the threshold of 10 Downing Street, there is no
question that his shadow chancellor will run for and, barring unforeseen
disaster, win the Labour leadership. Though an old-fashioned rightwinger,
his genuine indignation at poverty and his lack of 'side' has won him strong
support even on the hard left. As Mr Ken Livingstone said earlier this year
in the ultimate tribute to Mr Smith's political skill: 'The thing about John
is he has no real enemies.'

FT  21 MAR 92 / Barred Lloyd's syndicates hope to reopen soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS OF two synd-icates at the Lloyd's insurance market which were
ordered to stop trading this week are hopeful that they will be back in
business soon.
Syndicate 65, which has a capacity, or capital base, of Pounds 38m, and the
smaller 640, with a capital base of Pounds 4m, were ordered on Thursday not
to place or accept new business.
Syndicate 65 is one of the biggest marine syndicates at Lloyd's, but has
lost support from members' agents - who funnel Names on to syndicates - over
the past two years.
The Lloyd's decision was made as a result of the financial difficulties of
the Chester agency, which manages both syndicates. The agency manages both
syndicates.
Since October Chester has been supported by another agency, Hayter
Brockbank, which will now lead efforts to find new agents for the
syndicates. Hayter agreed an option to buy the Chester agency, but has
indicated that it now believes the syndicates would benefit from completely
new management.
Mr George Stevens, managing director, says that although neither syndicate
has particular problems they would not fit easily alongside Hayter's other
syndicates.
Among other considerations, added Mr Stevens, Chester syndicates have
different information systems.
Chester has also experienced difficulties in buying errors-and-omissions
insurance - which covers the agency managers against losses arising from
unintentional errors or omissions by their employees.
Premium rates for such cover - also provided by Lloyd's syndicates - have
risen in the wake of a large payout by underwriters after the settlement in
the Outhwaite case last month.
Pulbrook Underwriting Management, a subsidiary of the Merrett Group,
announced that it is to merge syndicates 731 and 1038. The successor
syndicate 1038 will have a capacity of about Pounds 25m.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Retailers face charges over fruit juice labels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Ministry of Agriculture is to prosecute 11 food companies for alleged
misleading labelling of orange juices.
The companies, which include big grocery retailers such as J. Sainsbury,
Tesco, Safeway and Asda, are alleged to have sold juices described as
'unsweetened' which, the ministry found last year, contained levels of corn
syrup or beet sugar above the prescribed levels. Most of the companies have
said they will contest the allegations.
At the time of the testing, Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, said: 'It
should not be assumed from these test results that the retailers and traders
of the various products tested were aware that the products offered were not
consistent with the labelling.'
The ministry said yesterday that the action was being taken under the
provisions of the Trade Descriptions Act and the Food Safety Act, although
it had previously stressed that there was no safety risk from adulteration.
In its survey last year, the ministry found that only five of the 21 brands
it tested consisted of pure orange juice as was claimed on the packaging.
Some of the juices tested contained 'pulpwash', which is produced by
processing orange husks.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Councillors cluster round government honeypot: How a city is
preparing its claim for funds to redevelop part of its centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of Leicester is racing for a place at a government honeypot called
City Challenge Two. The city's council, community groups, charities,
educational institutions and business leaders are talking about what will go
into a 5,000-word document appealing for Pounds 37.5m, spread over five
years, out of that pot.
Leicester is one of a possible total of 57 competitors for Urban Programme
funds from the environment department programme to revive rundown areas. But
only 20 can win.
Mr Michael Heseltine, environment secretary, has taken Pounds 150m a year
out of his departmental budget for urban renewal and will make those funds
available to the councils which can produce the best schemes concentrated on
specified geographical areas and involving all sections of the local
communities.
This is City Challenge, the first round of which took place last year on an
experimental basis. It is the government's main innovation in urban policy.
In spite of reservations about the competitive nature of City Challenge,
local authorities have responded energetically. What is happening in
Leicester is being mirrored up and down the country.
Leicester City Council, in fact, was irritated that it had not been invited
to take part in the first City Challenge. Shortly after his appointment as
the council's chief executive, Mr Imtiaz Farookhi seized the opportunity of
a visit last summer by Mr Heseltine for a quiet word. He won an informal
undertaking that Leicester could compete in City Challenge Two. Work on the
bid for funds started last August.
There was little discussion about the area of the city to be the subject of
the City Challenge bid. It was about 500 acres of inner Leicester based on
Bede Island. Work on the area had already been done: plans for redevelopment
had been discussed during the late 1980s with British Urban Developments, a
consortium of contracting companies which is now defunct.
'It is not the most deprived area of the city, but in terms of matching
problems and potential, it is likely to be the most effective (for City
Challenge),' said Ms Sue Sanford, co-ordinator of the bid.
The area around Bede Island is a jumble. In the middle is Leicester
Polytechnic, which is squeezed for space, and anxious to develop its campus
and improve its student housing. Leicester University is on the eastern
edge. There are three scrapyards with their attendant environmental
problems. There is a canalised river running through it - 'a potential
tourist route, but nobody stops on it,' said Ms Sanford. Traffic is also a
continuing difficulty.
About 10,000 people live in the area. Unemployment has risen to about 15 per
cent and many of those who do have jobs are on low pay. There is a host of
small employers. Ethnic minorities make up about 25 per cent of the local
population, slightly below the city's average of 30 per cent.
Having defined the area, the next step was to set up an organisation which
could draw up a development plan.
'We knew it had to be a partnership, so we made contact with the voluntary
sector, the university, the poly, the heath authority and so on,' Ms Sanford
said. A steering group was established and had its first meeting last
October.
'It has taken longer to get local employers on board,' Ms Sanford said. The
main reason was of the number of small employers, but the contacts were made
through the Chamber of Commerce and the Association of Asian Businessmen.
The 40 voluntary groups active in the area formed their own consortium, and
quickly produced a blueprint of the overall needs of the area.
The steering group was slimmed down to form a co-ordinating group consisting
of the city council's leader and chief executive, the leader of the county
council and representatives from the Chamber of Commerce, the private sector
and the voluntary groups, with others called in when needed.
By last November, the co-ordinating group was calling for proposals from the
community.
From the 300 proposals which arrived, and from the comments which emerged at
public meetings held in January and earlier this month, themes and concerns
about Bede Island began to emerge. They included housing, traffic, the
environment, better play and child-care facilities, more jobs, better
training facilities, a higher level of health care and crime prevention.
Now the pressure is to decide what goes into the 5,000 words which will
outline the Leicester City Challenge proposal. The final document will have
to list aims, means and costs.
There will be some large property projects, probably including, for example,
new science parks close to the educational institutions and a new football
ground for Leicester City.
There will also be many smaller projects in an attempt to answer the
concerns already voiced in the community.
Time is running out. The final bid has to be at the Department of
Environment by 5pm on April 22, shortly after the general election.
Leicester will do the work at Bede Island, even if does not win a place at
the honeypot. The work will just take longer.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Virgin Atlantic starts libel case against BA
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONG dogfight between Virgin Atlantic Airways and British Airways
intensified yesterday with Virgin's decision to start a libel action in the
High Court against BA and its chairman, Lord King.
The libel action comes a week after Virgin announced it was taking legal
action in the US against an alleged 'dirty tricks' campaign by BA against
its smaller UK rival.
Mr Richard Branson, Virgin chairman, said he was now starting legal
proceedings in the UK because of BA's comments - in a newsletter, letters
and a press release - on Virgin's allegations of 'unacceptable business
practices' by BA.
'The manner in which BA and Lord King have attacked both Virgin Atlantic and
myself, by dismissing Virgin's claims as fabrications, leaves me no choice
but to proceed this way,' Mr Branson said. Virgin said writs were in the
process of being served.
Mr Branson has accused BA of attempting to undermine his airline through a
smear campaign and by refusing to co-operate on engineering maintenance for
his aircraft.
He warned that he would take legal action if he did not receive an apology
from BA, assurances from the bigger carrier to halt its alleged 'dirty
tricks' campaign and the dismissal of Mr Brian Basham, a public relations
consultant allegedly involved in the campaign.
BA has repeatedly rejected Mr Branson's charges and has described his
decision to take legal action in the US as a publicity stunt.
Mr Branson said yesterday that he had done 'everything I can' to avoid two
British airlines appearing in court against each other.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Barclays to implement offer
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK is to implement a pay deal for 70,000 employees averaging
slightly more than 3 per cent - the lowest among the big four in recent
years - in spite of union opposition, Michael Smith writes.
The implementation of the increase on Monday signals a tougher line by the
banks on pay and conditions.
The Barclays pay package will be implemented in spite of a ballot concluded
yesterday by Bifu, the financial services union, which showed a majority of
members in favour of industrial action.
Members of the Barclays Group Staff Union have voted against the pay offer
and are being consulted by their leaders on whether they want to vote on
industrial action.
In spite of the union votes, it is extremely unlikely that there will be
industrial action. Bifu agreed that the ballot majority was small.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Banks rebuff protests on credit cards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS yesterday rounded on retailers for complaining about increased charges
for processing credit-card payments. They challenged the retailers to stop
taking credit cards if they were dissatisfied with the terms on offer.
The Credit Card Research Group, a lobby group set up by the banks, said
retailers' complaints were unreasonable. It claimed that they had come after
three years in which charges had fallen by a third, saving Pounds 200m.
'They (the retailers) have squeezed the card companies so hard that they are
now losing significant amounts of money on processing card transactions for
the retailer,' said Ms Elizabeth Phillips, director of the group.
'Retailers have the option of refusing to take cards,' she added. 'But they
should think carefully before doing so. There are many advantages to the
retailer in taking cards.'
She challenged the retailers to say whether or not they had passed on to
their customers the benefits of price cuts in credit card charges over the
last three years. 'There is no justification for them passing on the
increases to their customers now,' she said.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Jobs to be cut in mail sorting
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POST OFFICE confirmed yesterday that its Royal Mail subsidiary expected
to shed about a third of the 45,000 jobs in letter-sorting over the next few
years as a result of a Pounds 250m investment programme.
Machinery is being introduced which will be able to read handwritten post
codes rather than just typed addresses as at present. That will help Royal
Mail deal with an expected 18 per cent growth in volume over the next five
years and improve the quality of the service.
Royal Mail stressed that the job losses in sorting, estimated at 15,000,
would not require compulsory redundancies and that some staff will transfer
to other parts of its operations, which will expand.
The Union of Communication Workers, the main Post Office union, said it was
surprised about the numbers of jobs that might be shed but said it knew
about the technology plans. It also pointed to a national agreement on new
technology which commits the Post Office to consulting the union and
avoiding compulsory redundancies.
Mr Alan Johnson, UCW general-secretary elect, said he hoped the introduction
of new technology would cut the number of staff who have to work a six-day
week.

FT  21 MAR 92 / NHS wins first no-strike agreement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LISA WOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST no-strike agree-ment in the National Health Service was signed
yesterday by several unions and Homewood Trust, one of the first wave of new
hospital and community services trusts, Lisa Wood writes.
The agreement with three unions, the Royal College of Nursing and the
British Medical Association introduces a joint commitment to binding
pendulum arbitration in the event of a failure to agree. This is a system in
which an arbitrator accepts either side's final offer. The deal also
introduces procedures to exclude strikes.
Homewood employs 1,000 staff in mental health and services for handicapped
people in north-west Surrey.
Mr Steven Weeks, a senior researcher at the Cohse health service union, said
the arrangement might spread to other trusts, although Cohsewas yet to be
convinced of the merits of binding pendulum arbitration.
The union's view is that the agreement is not technically a no-strike deal,
but the effect will be to make strikes extremely unlikely.
The agreement is one of several radical new arrangements over pay and
conditions being introduced by the new NHS trusts. For staff recruited since
the trusts were established the trusts are able to opt out of nationally
agreed Whitley terms and conditions for staff as well as pay-review
settlements.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Police investigate pension scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRAUD SQUAD detectives are trying to trace about Pounds 1m missing from the
pension scheme of Peak Design, the collapsed Derbyshire furniture
manufacture.
Derbyshire police said yesterday that the investigation had been launched
after a complaint from Bradstock Trustee Services, the independent trustees
of the scheme.
The Derbyshire fraud squad investigation centres on pension fund assets of
between Pounds 900,000 and Pounds 1m which the trustees have been unable to
trace. The detectives are trying to contact the company's chairman, Mr Ted
Hunter.
Peak Design went into receivership on January 24. Halifax Property Services
said yesterday that before then they had been asked by Mr Hunter to handle
the sale of his home which is valued at Pounds 595,000. The home was vacated
earlier this month.
Bradstock said that since March 2 it had taken control of assets worth just
over Pounds 100,000, but that assets of 'around Pounds 1m are missing'.
Mr Tim Culverstone, a director of Bradstock, said the records were not
complete, but about Pounds 980,000 appeared to be missing including:
Pounds 50,000 in purchases of shares in the company which were now
worthless.
A Pounds 330,000 loan to the company plus interest which now seemed unlikely
to be repaid.
A Pounds 300,000 loan to another pension scheme involving Mr Hunter.
Pounds 300,000 spent buying property on the south coast from Weybridge
Consultants, a company which was controlled by Mr Hunter.
Mr Culverstone said a company search by the solicitors Evershed Wells &amp; Hind
on behalf of the independent trustees revealed that the south coast
properties had recently been transferred to Wynston Investments, registered
in Gibraltar. The address of that company, 28 Irish Town, Gibraltar, is that
of a firm of lawyers, Triay &amp; Triay.
Mr Giles Orton of Evershed said his firm was still investigating possible
links between Mr Hunter and the Gibraltar company and 'may have to sort out
who owns the property.'
Mr Culverstone said he was 'very concerned' about the position of the 83
members of the pension scheme.
Peak Design closed its plant at Alfreton, Derbyshire, last month with the
loss of 106 jobs.
Touche Ross, administrative receivers for the company, said last night that
since the pension scheme had been terminated in April 1990 beneficiaries had
been engaged in discussions with the company on what they claimed was money
owing to them.
Touche Ross confirmed that Mr Hunter was one of two former trustees of the
company.

FT  21 MAR 92 / NatWest changes Arrow case lawyers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL WESTMINSTER Bank has appointed new solicitors to act for it during
the latest Department of Trade and Industry inquiry into the Blue Arrow
affair, the bank disclosed yesterday.
The move was made because partners with Wilde Sapte, the law firm which has
advised NatWest over Blue Arrow until now, are expecting to be called to
give evidence to the inspectors.
Mr Malcolm Glover, a Wilde Sapte senior partner, yesterday confirmed that he
expected to be called to give evidence to the inspectors.
The latest DTI inquiry is investigating the roles played in the scandal by
the management of NatWest, rather than individuals in County NatWest, its
investment banking subsidiary - the subject of the first inquiry.
Mr Glover and Wilde Sapte acted for NatWest throughout both the first
inquiry and the recent trial which ended in four advisers being convicted of
conspiracy to defraud.
The court heard how the firm played a leading part in supplying documents to
the first DTI inquiry. During the trial, defence lawyers found documents
with handwritten additions by senior NatWest executives which had not been
submitted to the inspectors.
The secretary to the first inquiry, Mr Simon Morris, told the court he was
surprised that one document, on which Mr Tom Frost, the NatWest chief
executive had written, had not been submitted to the inspectors.
NatWest will now be represented in the second inquiry by Allen &amp; Overy. The
bank said: 'NatWest and Wilde Sapte have agreed that as Wilde Sapte partners
are expected to be giving evidence to the DTI inspectors, NatWest should be
advised by another law firm not connected with this inquiry.'
Nevertheless, lawyers from Wilde Sapte will continue to work with Allen &amp;
Overy to ensure full co-operation with the inquiry, the bank added.

FT  21 MAR 92 / BCCI executive in court today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first Bank of Credit and Commerce International executive to be charged
in England with criminal offences will appear in court in London today.
Mr Imran Mohammed Ahmad Iman, former BCCI account manager, will appear
before City of London magistrates charged with two offences of conspiracy
involving Dollars 179.4m. The Serious Fraud Office said last night that Mr
Iman, from Edgware, north London, had been arrested earlier yesterday.
The first charge alleges that between January 1 1986 and December 31 1990 Mr
Iman conspired with Mr Agha Hasan Abedi, Mr Swaleh Naqvi and other members
of BCCI's senior management to falsify the accounting records of BCCI
(Overseas) by causing management fees and other charges totalling about
Dollars 74.4m to be levied on certain loan accounts 'when to (his) knowledge
the borrowers of those loans had been held harmless for all such fees,
interest and charges by the bank'.
The second charge alleges that between November 30 1987 and September 28
1990, Mr Iman conspired with Mr Abedi, Mr Naqvi, Dr Ghaith R. Pharoan and
others to conceal loan guarantees amounting to Dollars 105m required by
BCCI's auditors for audit purposes.
Mr Iman is the second man to be charged in England in connection with BCCI.
Last month Mr Mohammed Abdul Baqi, a former managing director of Attock Oil,
a group based in London, was charged with conspiracy. He is accused of
conspiring with Mr Basheer Chowdry, BCCI's former UK regional general
manager, and other members of BCCI senior management to supply false
information to BCCI auditors showing that Attock Oil owed BCCI more than
Dollars 76m. Mr Baqi has been released on bail and is due in court again on
May 16.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Dearer petrol helps to keep inflation at 4.1%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INFLATION stayed stubbornly unchanged at 4.1 per cent in February,
disappointing government hopes that it would drop to 4 per cent.
However, an increase in the German inflation rate to 4.3 per cent in
February means that Britain's annual inflation rate fell below Germany's for
the first time since 1967.
The end of heavy discounting in the January sales caused prices in certain
groups of the retail prices index to bounce back last month, and that left
the annual rate unchanged. Figures from the Central Statistical Office
showed that the index rose from 135.6 in January to 136.3 in February, based
on a weighting of 100 in January 1987. This represented a rise of 0.5 per
cent.
In spite of the month-on-month increase, the UK inflation rate remained
below the EC average of 4.6 per cent in January, and below the 4.3 per cent
average of ERM countries.
After a sharp drop in clothing and footwear prices in January because of
heavy discounting in the sales, the rate of inflation for this component of
the RPI rose 1.3 per cent last month after a fall of 5.1 per cent in
January.
Higher petrol prices boosted the motoring expenditure component 0.7 per cent
on the month, although it was also affected by some increases in second-hand
car prices and spare parts. The higher petrol prices, against a drop in
prices a year ago, contributed to keeping the underlying rate of inflation,
which excludes mortgage payments, stable at 5.6 per cent.
Leisure-services prices registered an annual rate of 11.3 per cent,
unchanged on the previous month. The month-on-month increase was 0.1 per
cent.
Food prices rose 0.5 per cent last month, but there was a sharp drop in
seasonal food price inflation, reflecting the mild winter. The rate of
seasonal food price inflation dropped to 0.1 per cent last month from 3.3
per cent in January.
A monthly increase of 0.9 per cent in household-goods prices reflected some
recovery from January's record price reductions. There was no change in the
cost of household services.
While the year-on-year rate of increase in the RPI could come down to below
4 per cent in March as the recent reduction in mortgage interest rates takes
effect, April could be a different story.
The increases announced in the Budget earlier this month in excise duty on
alcohol, tobacco, petrol and car road tax could combine to push the index
up.

THE KENYAN government yesterday banned political rallies in an effort to
curb tribal fighting, which has killed more than 70 people this year.
The ban, a serious setback to Kenya's transition to a multi-party democracy,
will alarm aid donors who last November linked future assistance to economic
reform and civil rights.
The opposition said clashes between President Daniel arap Moi's Kalenjin
clan, and Luo and Luhya tribes, had been encouraged by the government, as
pretext to delaying an election.

MICKEY MOUSE is to return to China after a two-year absence - courtesy of
the recently negotiated bilateral agreement with the US over intellectual
property rights.
Disney products had a run of success in China before 1989, the year of the
crackdown on dissidents in Beijing's Tiananmen Square. A television show
used to attract 300m viewers a week, according to Mr John Feenie, executive
vice president for Disney Consumer Products, Asia Pacific.
But the company decided to pull out when it felt that counterfeiting of
Disney products had become endemic.
Now, with the Chinese economy booming and a certain amount of protection
from 'piracy', Disney has issued a product franchise to a Hong Kong company
that will unleash Mickey and friends on what is expected to be a highly
receptive market.
Mr Feenie said Disney's theme park division was watching developments in
China but there was no immediate plan to bring Disneyland into the Communist
country.
He said Disney products would be sold initially through 20 exclusive Disney
sales counters in five mainland cities, with the start-up planned for
children's day, June 1.
This will coincide with the launch of a Disney magazine, and Disney
television should return to Chinese screens before the end of the year.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Gadaffi 'ready to hand Lockerbie suspects to UN'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and Britain were sceptical last night of a report that Libya was
prepared 'in principle' to hand over to the United Nations two men accused
of masterminding the bombing of a Pan Am aircraft over Lockerbie.
The report surfaced as Libya's North African neighbours, headed by Egypt,
Morocco and Tunisia, engaged in a flurry of meetings to try to head off UN
Security Council moves to impose sanctions against Libya, including an arms
and civil aviation embargo.
In Tunis, an unidentified North African diplomat was quoted as saying that
Arab states were 'intensively working' on a solution and that Libya had
agreed in principle to surrender the two accused Libyan agents to the UN
secretary-general.
But British and US officials suggested that Libya might be seeking to win
time before an eventual vote on a proposed Security Council resolution
calling for sanctions - expected early next week.
Britain and the US have demanded, backed by UN resolution 731, that Libya
hand over the two men - Mr Abdul Basit Ali Magrahi and Mr Lamin Khalifa
Fahima - for trial in either the US or Scotland. France has also demanded
that Libya surrender four men suspected of bombing a UTA flight over Niger
in 1989.
US officials said Libya's unconditional surrender of the two men would
suffice to forestall a vote on the UN resolution.
Other western officials said the move might ease but not entirely remove
pressure on Libya, since Tripoli, under the terms of resolution 731, should
still hand over the men linked to the UTA bombing and disassociate itself
from all acts of terrorism.
Colonel Muammer Gadaffi's regime has wriggled uncomfortably under the
pressure from the US, Britain and France. It has proposed a string of
solutions short of western demands while stockpiling vital goods and
shifting billions of dollars of overseas assets in case of sanctions.
Anxiety among Libya's neighbours that Col Gadaffi's regime might be fatally
destabilised by external pressure has prompted a concerted attempt to broker
a solution, led by Egypt.
In its scramble for a way out, Libya yesterday despatched a senior envoy to
Riyadh to meet Prince Saud al-Faisal, Saudi foreign minister, while Major
Khoueldi Hamidi, a Libyan defence official, held two sessions of talks with
King Hassan of Morocco on Thursday.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government has given its blessing to attempts to re-open a
bankrupt shipyard near Marseilles, attracting opposition allegations of
underhand electioneering tactics ahead of tomorrow's regional poll.
The yard, at La Ciotat, is an historic industrial symbol in the
Provence-Alpes-Cote d'Azur region, where the extreme right-wing National
Front has had a big lead in opinion polls, ahead of conservatives and Mr
Bernard Tapie, the flamboyant businessman backed by the Socialists.
The district or departmental authority has just bought La Ciotat's assets
from Banque Worms, a nationalised bank which took them over two years after
Nordmed, the former operator, went into liquidation in 1987.
The local authority has been keen to re-open the yard with Lexmar, the
Swedish shipbuilder, ever since its demise, but it was only earlier this
week that a formerly sceptical government gave its go-ahead for
negotiations.
This followed an announcement by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the finance minister,
that he was prepared to give a 'helping hand' to attempts to refloat the
yard, so long as no state aid was expected.
Lexmar was yesterday preparing a rescue package, with local investors, to
offer to the departmental authority. Previously, the government had resisted
rescue attempts on the grounds that the yard could never become competitive.
Any rescue attempt would have to get agreement from the European Commission,
which allowed the French government to pay out FFr2bn (Pounds 206m) of
redundancy aid on condition that the yard was taken out of production. But
French officials say the restriction was only for five years, until March
1993.

   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday appealed to Tatars to vote 'no' in a
referendum on independence from the Russian Federation, saying the poll
could unleash violence and threaten the course of reforms in Russia.
He warned Tatars to remember that 'every political mistake bears a concrete
price'.
It was time to draw the lessons of inter-ethnic strife over the last few
years in the former Soviet Union, he said on television on the eve of the
poll in the autonomous republic west of Moscow. He said a vote for
independence would set Tatars and Russians within Tatarstan against one
another.
The Russian parliament meanwhile resorted to 'divide and rule' tactics to
try to tackle rebellion from another semi-independent enclave which is
threatening to break away. Meeting in closed session, it approved a
resolution splitting up Chechen-Ingushetia, another former autonomous
republic whose leaders want independence.
The resolution provides for the carving out over the next two years of a new
republic called Ingushetia from the territory of Chechen-Ingushetia. The
move is likely to provoke a fierce reaction from Chechen-Ingushetia's
President Jokhar Dudayev, who has renamed the republic Chechnya to assert
the domination of the Chechen nation.
Tatarstan meanwhile pressed ahead with its referendum, defying a call by the
Russian parliament that Tatarstan make the poll comply with Russia's
constitution.
The expected pro-independence vote could encourage others among the 20
autonomous republics to rebel. The territories were created by the
Bolsheviks to give an illusion of self-determination for various ethnic
groups and maintain 'divide and rule'. Although the leaders of 18 of them
this month initialled a draft federal treaty keeping them within the Russian
Federation, hopes of it being ratified are fading.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Thunder of battle as Washington's giants lock horns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WASHINGTON ushered in the spring equinox yesterday with predictable and
choreographed rolls of political thunder - as President George Bush and the
Democratic leadership in Congress squared off over how best to revitalise
the US economy and thus win the hearts, minds and votes of the country.
Mr Bush, speaking in the White House to invited supporters, declared he
would veto the Dollars 77.5bn (Pounds 45.4bn) economic recovery tax bill
finalised overnight by two Democratic grandees and passed only hours before
by both houses of Congress. Its great fault, he said, was that it included
some tax increases.
He then announced he would ask Congress to stop funding 68 projects and
programmes, worth Dollars 3.6bn, that he considered examples of 'pork
barrel' profligacy. They include such vital items as research into asparagus
yields and the prickly pear, as well as maintenance of gondolas in Idaho.
Some, Mr Bush said, 'would be funny if they weren't serious.'
Even the White House concedes there is some doubt over whether the
president's authority, using a never-used provision in the 1974 Budget Act,
extends to requiring Congress to vote on specific items of spending. He
seems to be trying a variation of the 'line item veto' used in many states.
But the political point was to throw down the gauntlet to Congress.
Just in case the message had not been received by the Democrats, he
proclaimed: 'The bottom line is that we all need a new Congress.' He again
threw his support behind the populist right-wing movement to limit the
number of terms a Congressman or Senator may serve.
It was known in advance the president would veto the economic recovery tax
bill and it passed both houses by margins much less than needed to override
a veto. Still, Mr Dan Rostenkowski, chairman of the House ways and means
committee and co-author of the bill along with Senator Lloyd Bentsen, said:
'We have met the president's challenge.'
In his State of the Union message at the end of January, Mr Bush had called
on Congress to act by March 20. The bill in fact incorporates many of his
proposals, but in pursuing fiscal neutrality it finances tax credits for
middle classes by an increase, from 31 to 36 per cent, in the top marginal
rate of tax paid by individuals earning more than Dollars 115,000 (Pounds
67,400) a year.
Last month, in a Damascene conversion, Mr Bush confessed he had been
grievously wrong in dropping his 1988 election pledge never to raise taxes.
Yesterday's veto lived up to that promise.
It also brought on his head equally predictable Democratic denunciations. Mr
Thomas Foley, speaker of the house, said the president's speech 'is the most
partisan I have ever heard coming in the guise of a presidential address.'
Mr George Mitchell, Senate majority leader, chipped in: 'He should act like
a president, not like a panicky candidate for re-election.'
Mr Bush's strategy is perfectly clear. He wishes to re-establish his
credentials as a leader who will not raise taxes, even on the wealthy, and
will cut spending; the Democrats in Congress, in contrast, become the 'tax
and spend' party, a tag which has hurt Democratic presidential candidates in
the last three elections.
He also knows that Congress, engulfed in a series of scandals, is not the
national flavour of the month. One poll yesterday found public confidence in
Congress at an historic low of under 20 per cent, about half Mr Bush's
rating.
The Democrat-run Congress, therefore, is an inviting interim target for Mr
Bush before he locks horns with his probable Democratic opponent, Governor
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, in the presidential election proper.

THE Serb-controlled Yugoslav army and the republic of Croatia, until
recently at war, have joined forces to produce weapons for export, writes
Laura Silber in Belgrade.
Djuro Djakovic, a weapons factory in Croatia, will honour a Dollars 300m
two-year contract for delivery of 200 M-84 tanks to Kuwait. The Yugoslav
federal office which oversees arms sales said the outbreak of war had
prevented Yugoslavia from fulfilling the contract.
Croatia will get Dollars 300,000 of the Dollars 1.5m price of each tank.
Factories from all Yugoslav republics contribute parts for the M-84s.
General Antun Tus, chief of staff of Croat forces, admitted it may 'sound
paradoxical that warring countries are in this joint business of production
and export of weapons to a third country'. But he insisted there was no
danger because the tanks were entirely under Croatian control.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RESTRUCTURING of the German Bundesbank, to reduce the influence of the
federal states in its ruling council, passed a key hurdle yesterday in the
Bundestag.
The lower house of the Germany parliament agreed to cut the number of
separate 'state central banks' from 11 to nine, instead of raising the
number to 16 to accommodate all the new states in the former East Germany.
The move, backed by the government and Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank
president, is being pushed through in spite of opposition from most of the
states.
It is intended to prevent the German central bank from becoming unwieldy and
from being dominated by potentially maverick state central bankers against
the views of its full-time directors.
In recent months state representatives have twice come into conflict with Mr
Schlesinger and his full-time colleagues: in pushing through a half-point
rise in interest rates when the Bundesbank president favoured a
quarter-point; and in bringing reservations about European monetary union
into the open.
It now seems a deal will have to be negotiated in a conciliation committee
between the Bundestag, in which the government has a majority, and the
Bundesrat, which represents the 16 states, now with a Social Democrat
majority.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Old enemies agree to surveillance flights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATO allies and countries of the former Soviet bloc reached an Open Skies
agreement in Vienna yesterday, allowing them to fly unarmed surveillance
aircraft over each other's territory.
The accord, reached six months after the revival of negotiations, means that
a treaty can be signed by foreign ministers at the Conference on Security
and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE) in Helsinki on Tuesday.
The pact is due to be initialled today by representatives of 24 countries
including Russia, Ukraine and Belarus. Other new republics as well as
European countries outside Nato and the former Warsaw Pact will be able to
join later.
Russia and representatives from the nine-nation Western European Union are
due to meet in Moscow next week to discuss the possible use of
jointly-funded aircraft to carry out Open Skies flights.
Initially, surveillance will be by cameras and radar, with infra-red sensors
used only by bilateral agreement, but this restriction will be lifted after
three years. Each country will have a quota of flights.
Data from the flights will be available to all signatories, although payment
arrangements have still to be settled.
President Bush launched the Open Skies initiative in May 1989, taking up a
proposal first put forward by President Eisenhower in 1955. But talks ran
aground a year later over restrictions sought by Moscow. They resumed last
September. Moscow dropped its insistence on territorial limits and the right
to overfly US bases in other regions. In exchange, it obtained the right for
any signatory to provide its own aircraft for surveillance missions.

THE SHARPENING tension between Russia and Ukraine burst into the open last
night at the end of a meeting in Kiev of the leaders of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS).
President Leonid Kravchuk of Ukraine, the summit's host, was openly and
bitterly caustic towards Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, before
hundreds of journalists at a final press conference.
Declaring none of the 23 agreements signed had any real importance and
Ukraine had signed only one minor technical document among the military
treaties, Mr Kravchuk said while he held the Russian people in high esteem,
'I forbear from commenting on Russian leaders.'
Accusing Mr Yeltsin of being ironic in speaking earlier of a 'constructive
attitude' at the summit, Mr Kravchuk matched his irony by saying Russia's
attitude had pleased him, 'because I now understand we will never agree to a
division of the assets of the former Soviet Union.'
At the summit Mr Yeltsin brusquely dismissed Ukraine's proposal to discuss
splitting up all former Soviet property, including foreign embassies and
reserves of the former Soviet state bank, Gosbank.
In contrast to bland statements by Mr Yeltsin and other presidents that the
CIS was essential and vigorously alive, Mr Kravchuk said: 'If the situation
does not improve, the commonwealth is doomed.' Later, senior Ukrainian
officials said they believed the next scheduled CIS session in Tashkent
would be its last.
Mr Kravchuk as good as called his Russian counterpart a liar. He said he had
not phoned Mr Yeltsin earlier this week to promise to return tactical
nuclear missiles, as the Russian leader claimed - and, turning to Mr Yeltsin
on the podium at the press conference, he said: 'Boris Nikolaevich (Yeltsin)
can confirm that.' Mr Yeltsin made no response.
Earlier, Mr Kravchuk confirmed that Ukraine had ceased to send tactical
nuclear missiles to Russia. No more would be sent until guarantees had been
given that they would be destroyed under international supervision.
Western military and diplomatic observers at the meeting said Mr Kravchuk's
call for international supervision might strike a sympathetic chord in the
west, which is concerned about proliferation of nuclear states.
Ominously, the Ukrainian president said Russia could not be blamed for
acting according to its own interests - and 'we must learn to do the same,
we must act in the interests of our people and will not be swayed from
this.'
The one positive agreement appeared to be a resolution to create a CIS
peacekeeping force for use in national and ethnic conflicts, as in the
disputed territory of Nagorno-Karabakh and the Trans Dnestr region of
Moldova.
Mr Seitkazy Mataev, spokesman for President Nursultan Nazarbayev of
Kazakhastan, said that after an hour of 'heated discussions' the presidents
had agreed to create a force that would intervene once there was a ceasefire
and on the invitation of at least one side. But the force would have no
military role.
Ukraine and Russia now seem set for a further dangerous escalation of
tension, with none of the outstanding disagreements between them - over
splitting up property, maintenance of borders and division of the Black Sea
Fleet - even discussed, let alone settled.
About 33,000 St Petersburg students and a large number of pensioners will
each get Rbs150 out of funds from the sale of EC food delivered to the city,
writes Andrew Hill in Brussels. The European Commission said about Ecu80m
(Pounds 57m) of nearly Ecu200m of food aid to St Petersburg and Moscow had
been delivered.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Kohl aims to break Gatt impasse in Bush talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany will meet President George Bush today for
talks which the German government hopes will help to break the logjam in the
stalled Gatt negotiations on liberalisation of trade, writes Quentin Peel.
The two leaders are also expected to discuss the state of the world economy
and the consequences of the collapse of the Soviet Union in their talks at
Camp David, the president's weekend retreat.
Mr Kohl is flying to the US under heavy domestic pressure to use his good
offices to broker a deal on the Gatt talks between his two closest allies -
the US and France. German industry this week issued a renewed warning that
failure of the trade talks could tip the world economy into outright
recession.
At the same time he is politically committed to protect German farmers,
amongsthe most heavily subsidised in the European Community, and he is
extremely anxious not to be seen to isolate France, the major agricultural
exporter in the Community.
The government spokesman, Mr Dieter Vogel, insisted yesterday that Mr Kohl
was not seeking to negotiate in Washington, and was not stepping outside the
common EC negotiating position in the trade talks. These talks are bogged
down in disagreement on the extent of long-term income support for European
farmers and on proposed quantity restrictions on future EC farm exports.
But he confirmed that the Chancellor saw the possibility of a trade-off,
with the US accepting a freeze on its sales of cereal substitutes to the EC,
while the Community would agree to quantity restrictions on its own exports.
In a statement issued on Wednesday, the German government said it was still
fighting for the interests of German farmers, while accepting that EC
surplus farm production must be reduced through logical policies and price
cuts. The Gatt round must ensure the basis for future farm policy, including
building in income support for farmers and adequate protection from imports.
'This external protection is nevertheless not possible without a
satisfactory agreement on the quantity of future subsidised EC farm exports
and of so-called cereal substitutes,' Mr Vogel said.
The German federation of industry (BDI), the country's main business lobby,
stepped up its pressure on the Chancellor with a presentation concluding
that success in the Gatt talks was critical both for the world economy and
for Germany.
Mr Heinrich Weiss, BDI president, said the negative effects for Germany of a
failure would be greater than for any other country, with one in every three
German jobs dependent on exports.
'A policy which risks failure of the Gatt negotiations because of the
controversial special protection for EC agriculture would endanger both
national and international well-being,' he said.

collapse after government refuses to concede 9.5 per cent demand

<TEXT>
PAY TALKS for more than 2.6m German public sector workers collapsed
yesterday after the government and federal states refused to improve their
3.5 per cent pay offer.
The government immediately appealed for arbitration to head off strike
action.
Unions representing 2.3m public sector workers, 240,000 postal workers and
110,000 railway workers, all declared a formal failure of the negotiations
after two days of often bitter and stormy talks in Stuttgart.
But their plan to call an immediate strike ballot was foiled by the
government move to go to arbitration, which imposes a compulsory cooling-off
period of up to six weeks. Nevertheless, the prospect of a big public sector
strike in Germany is still real.
'The two sides are still worlds apart, between what the employers are
offering and what the trade unions are demanding,' said a representative of
the local authorities, the third tier of employers involved below the
central government and the states.
Mrs Monika Wulf-Mathies, leader of the OTV public sector union, said the
government's 3.5 per cent offer was a 'declaration of war.' The unions are
seeking 9.5 per cent, plus extra holiday pay.
The government's hard line reflects anxiety about extraordinary pressures on
the public purse stemming from German unification costs and the signals that
a high pay award would give for other sectors, including key engineering
workers.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl this week approved an increase in pensions of only
2.7 per cent, well below the current 4.2 per cent annual inflation rate, to
a storm of criticism.
Behind him he has the grim determination of the Bundesbank to stifle the
threat of inflation by tightly controlling money supply and keeping
short-term interest rates at a record level.
Public sector wages have been resolved in arbitration twice before in the
past decade, but the two sides appear more firmly entrenched than in recent
years. However, neither side really wants all-out conflict, aware that the
German economy is in danger of tipping into recession and that the cost of
massive transfers from the west German economy to the east is still rising.
West German industry had the world's highest labour costs last year for the
third consecutive year, according to a study yesterday, Reuter reports from
Bonn.
The Institute of German Economy (IW), financed by German industry, said
labour costs in west German industry in 1991 were DM40.48 (Pounds 14.17 at
current exchange rates) an hour, DM1.65 (about 58 pence) higher than in
Switzerland. The Swiss had the highest labour costs from 1986 to 1988; the
Germans since.
Portugal had the lowest industrial labour costs among 20 countries surveyed
by the IW. Hourly labour costs there last year were DM7.88 (Pounds 2.76),
below the DM11.14 (Pounds 3.90) paid in Greece, the next cheapest.
The strength of the D-Mark and rising costs of social welfare were the main
reasons for the high German levels.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Life group suspends agents for retraining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WINDSOR LIFE, a life assurance company, has 'voluntarily suspended' its 350
sales agents after a compliance review by Lautro, the industry's
self-regulatory body.
A spokesman for Windsor Life, based in Telford, Shropshire, said the agents
had been suspended on Thursday. They would not be allowed to write new
business until they had been retrained and adequate testing procedures had
been put in place.
'It is a request, not a disciplinary proceeding,' he said. The spokesman
acknowledged, however, that if sales had not ceased, the regulator was
likely to have taken action.
'The issue is about weakness in compliance,' the spokesman said. It is not
clear how long the suspension would last. 'The company wants to make sure
they get it right,' he said. It may be weeks before the sales force will be
allowed to seek new business.
Lautro declined to comment on its talks with Windsor Life, which is wholly
owned by New York Life, the US's fourth largest insurance company. It is
believed, however, to have conducted a regularly scheduled compliance review
in December and discovered that sales agents did not know enough about the
design or cost of their own products, among other things.
Failure to train sales agents properly goes to the heart of regulators'
concerns about what is known as mis-selling: inducing consumers to purchase
insurance policies which are inappropriate for their needs. Such policies
are too frequently cancelled in the first few years of their life, causing
consumers to lose a large portion of premiums paid.
Sales agents who do not know enough about each client's circumstances or the
costs and features of the products they recommend cannot meet regulatory
requirements to offer 'best advice' and are likely to mis-sell.
Lautro has only twice before sought a voluntary cessation of sales by a life
insurance company and only once, just over a month ago, suspended a life
insurance company's sales force for failure to comply with its rules.
The sales agents involved are all either directly employed by Windsor Life
or are 'tied agents' who work for an independent agency selling Windsor
products exclusively. The spokesman said sales agents receive no salary, and
are paid only by commissions earned on each policy sold.
Windsor Life sells unit-linked policies. In 1991, its new business rose 22
per cent to Pounds 4m. As of December 31, it had Pounds 130m under
management, but it has since bought Gresham Life, which had Pounds 490m
under management.

FT  21 MAR 92 / The Texas king who would be president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY time Mr Ross Perot, the Texas businessman, appears on US television,
viewers ring in to ask him to run for president.
If he decides to do so, as an independent, he will not have to worry about
the factor that caused Mr Paul Tsongas to drop out of the Democratic race
this week - lack of money.
Mr Perot, who sold his EDS computer services empire to General Motors for
Dollars 2.5bn (Pounds 1.44bn) in 1984 and owns a large slice of his native
Texas, is one of the wealthiest men in the US. He could easily finance a
presidential bid out of petty cash.
This week he virtually launched his campaign with a speech on what he sees
as wrong with the US government.
Scores of volunteers are busily gathering signatures to get his name on the
ballot in all 50 states - a condition Mr Perot has imposed before formally
declaring his candidacy.
Mr Perot's appeal is largely based on his well-burnished image as a rare
combination of boy scout and business leader, on the assumption that he
could do for the US what he did for EDS.
However, to the average voter, his best-known achievement is the rescue of
two EDS employees from an Iranian jail - an episode glamourised in 'Wings of
Eagles', by Ken Follett, the British novelist.
As a candidate, he would combine this reputation for derring-do with an
intriguing blend of political standpoints.
There would be a little of Mr Tsongas's call for sacrifices to tackle the
country's economic problems; a little of Mr Jerry Brown, the former Governor
of California, with his attack on the political contributors who finance
electoral campaigns; and a little of Governor Mario Cuomo of New York, whose
public musings over whether or not to run for president kept the US
entertained last autumn.
The public may not be so appreciative when it discovers he wants to
eliminate the federal budget deficit by raising taxes - and improving tax
collection - and slashing spending.
The core of Mr Perot's message is that the American people are owners of
their country and must take responsibility as if they were shareholders.
He also proposes a constitutional amendment barring Congress from raising
taxes or voting on its own pay rises. Such measures would have to be decided
by referendum.
However, Mr Perot is used to wielding unrestrained power as chief executive,
and would find the constitutional limitations of the presidency extremely
constricting.
Some commentators believe there is a possibility, though a remote one, that
Mr Perot could come to symbolise the 'real change' option to many voters,
siphoning votes away not only from President Bush but also from Governor
Bill Clinton of Arkansas, the likely Democratic nominee. 'There has been no
time in modern American history more ripe for a candidate to run for the
White House against both parties,' wrote Mr Charles Cook, a Washington
political analyst, in Roll Call, Congress's village newspaper.
All the same, the odds are heavy that Mr Perot will find candidacy too
constraining a role and discover some pressing reason to withdraw.
He has not yet made it clear if as president he would ban beards and
moustaches in the civil service, as he did at EDS.
As one former EDS employee put it: 'He'll never run for president - he's
already king.'

FT  21 MAR 92 / Major spearheads Tory drive to regain initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, ALISON SMITH and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BLITZ of personal appearances by the prime minister signalled the start
yesterday of an all-out Conservative drive to regain the initiative after a
week that saw Labour take the offensive in the general election campaign.
Labour seized on yesterday's unchanged inflation rate of 4.1 per cent to
renew its charge that the government is doing nothing to promote recovery.
Meanwhile, Mr John Major led an onslaught on Labour's shadow budget.
His combative language displayed a fresh aggression that contrasted markedly
with his affable and conciliatory prime ministerial image.
In a speech last night in his Huntingdon constituency, he referred to a
hardline socialism 'brewing and bubbling' under the surface in a party
offering a 'dismal, destructive and divisive vision of Britain'.
Mr Neil Kinnock, speaking on a campaign tour of Cardiff, described the
inflation figures as 'a very grave disappointment' for the government which
was 'suppressing inflation by devastating the economy'. The Labour leader
said: 'They are certainly not curing it and they are not effectively
controlling it.'
Mr Paddy Ashdown, the Liberal Democrat leader, echoed similar charges, but
Mr Major brushed aside the criticism. Welcoming the figures as 'excellent
news', he denied that economists had expected a fall and said that for the
first time in a quarter of a century Britain had a lower inflation rate than
Germany. He spelt out his determination for Britain to achieve zero
inflation. 'No other party will set that target; no other party cares so
much. But it is the only long-term way to proper peace of mind for the
pensioner; and the only long-term way to stable, permanent jobs.' The clash
over inflation came as Tory campaign managers planned to use the weekend to
reverse what is widely perceived as a narrow Labour opinion poll lead.
Party strategists said they had always expected it would take some time for
charges that Labour will raise taxes to pay off in the opinion polls.
In the interim, cabinet ministers were laying down a barrage of attacks on
Labour's shadow budget. The prime minister and Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, both rounded on the proposals as a gratuitous assault on middle
income earners.
Mr Major warned that the increased income tax and National Insurance
contributions would create a country 'where people have no incentive, no
hope, no choice and no future'. He said: 'We will push this argument day
after day after day after day because it is a damaging recipe for Britain.'
he said.
Today, the Tories are expected to publish a revised costing of Labour's
policies, based on its manifesto promises. It is expected to prove the
pre-cursor to a repetition of the 'tax bombshell' charge that Mr Kinnock
must raise income tax to pay for his programme.
The theme will be taken up this weekend by Mr Michael Heseltine, the
environment secretary, in speeches and by Mr Major in speeches and
television interviews.
The February inflation figures - the lowest rate since October last year -
disappointed some expectations of a drop to 4 per cent. Prices in some
components of the retail prices index - particularly clothing and footwear
and household goods - bounced back after record discounts in January's
sales.
Higher petrol prices also kept the inflation rate up despite a sharp drop in
seasonal food price inflation.
A Harris poll of seats in the capital carried out for London Weekend
Television, shows Labour three points ahead of the Tories.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Olympia &amp; York banks to meet over debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and RICHARD WATERS AND VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS to Olympia &amp; York, the world's biggest property developer, are
preparing for talks to consider the secretive group's debts estimated to be
at least CDollars 10bn (Pounds 4.8bn).
Banks from around the world are expected to be called to a meeting within
weeks to seek a way to support the transatlantic property group built up by
the Canadian Reichmann brothers.
O&amp;Y, whose flagship developments include the World Financial Centre in New
York and Canary Wharf in London, has seen its income squeezed by the
continuing recession in North America and Britain. Falling property values
have made banks increasingly nervous.
The group's debts are a closely guarded secret but Canadian real estate
analysts estimate its debt at between CDollars 10bn and CDollars 20bn.
A decision to call the meeting lies with the group's main bankers, Canadian
Imperial Bank of Commerce (CIBC) and Citibank of the US. Others are
expecting a formal invitation to attend.
Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's president, is a director of CIBC, but the bank
declined yesterday to comment on any aspect of its business dealings with
O&amp;Y.
An O&amp;Y spokesman said: 'There are ongoing discussions with individual
banks.' He said no meeting had taken place or been scheduled but would not
comment further.
Any restructuring of O&amp;Y's debt by the group's bankers would amount to one
of the largest financial operations of its kind in recent years.
A comparable operation was the USDollars 8bn debt restruct-uring of Mr
Rupert Murdoch's media empire in early 1991.
One banker said of the group's cash squeeze: 'It has been taking a lot of
money at a time when the businesses are not generating cash. Also, there's
no new money to pay today's bills.'
He added that bankers are not content to rely only on the group's various
properties as securities for their loans. 'It's fine to own a piece of real
estate, but it's not cash.' O&amp;Y is already understood to have arranged a
loan with a number of its bankers to replace two short-term financing
arrangements totalling CDollars 800m.
The company has already refinanced about CDollars 380m, and is now in talks
with the banks to replace the rest with more stable, longer-term loans.
O&amp;Y's problems are due in large part to the resources it has been forced to
devote to the Pounds 1.3bn Canary Wharf project in the London Docklands,
Europe's largest office project.
The company was successful at signing up tenants before the completion of
the first phase of 4.4m sq ft but, in the past 18 months, as the recession
in the UK has deepened, the rate of lettings has slowed sharply. Forty per
cent of the existing space remains unlet.
A further 6m sq ft are due to be completed by 1997 although it is unclear
whether the whole project will be finished.
This week the company withdrew a Pounds 215m financing package to attract
private investors into Canary Wharf.
The company is also under pressure in North America, where it is fighting to
keep some of its tenants in cities which have sharply increased vacancy
rates.

FT  21 MAR 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: All you need is doves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME journalists are paid good money to position themselves at the centre of
affairs. News-sleuths or feature-hounds, they are expected to be where it is
happening, to know what is happening, and to file copy that gleams with
immediacy.
Then there are the rest of us, a band small in number - journalists such as
me (still paid good money, very often better) who are supposed to hang back
a bit, fossick at the margins, sleuth in dark corners, ask original
questions, ponder and dwell, mull things over, make unexpected journeys, fly
in small aircraft, throw frequent but fetching tantrums and filter all we
see and hear through the silk-fine mesh of our experience and intellect.
It takes all sorts.
This week, for example, I have been nowhere near the hustings, in Britain or
America. Nothing so predictable. My game is far deeper, my quarry more
obscure. For reasons I cannot go into (journalism is a jungle: brutish and
predatory), I was briefly in Miami; then briefly in San Juan; then briefly
in St Maarten, then briefly somewhere else. Now I am in Miami again. Or
somewhere remarkably like it.
Rush, rush; scurry, scurry. But I have had odd moments to myself, most of
which I have spent delving into a collection of the writings of E B White:
wise and witty pieces, most of them quite short, published in The New Yorker
between 1927 and 1976.
The man I have to thank for introducing me to E B White is the FT books
editor, who stopped by my desk recently, said he had a present for me and
handed me the volume. Then he went to lunch.
E B White is brilliant. On March 26 1955, for example, a piece by him -
'Stock Market Zigzags' - appeared in The New Yorker. It was very short, so I
can quote it almost in full, for its pertinence has not dimmed.
'We don't fully subscribe to the bald statement that confidence in this
country's economy can be lost in a day', White started. 'There are tangible
assets that are not easily wiped out - the soil, the climate, the industrial
vigor, the immense spirit of a people who won freedom through revolutionary
zeal and are still willing to work for it. And there are intangibles that
give the economy fertility and vitality.
'The stock market, which is a sort of horse track without the horses, does
not deserve its wide reputation as a barometer. It sometimes sows the
hurricane, instead of reporting the breeze. It is naturally flighty . . .
But what the market does symbolise, in its nervous way, is the health-giving
flexibility of capitalism - the trait that keeps our economy delicately
balanced but that makes it a far better servant of the people than the
state-driven economies that have hardly any elasticity at all.'
So far so good. But then White got to the point.
'The other day', he continued, 'in San Diego, the American economy even
adjusted to springtime: work was halted on a Dollars 7m building programme
to give a dove time to hatch her eggs. Our confidence in a society that
observes this sentimental ritual and practices this fiscal folly cannot be
toppled in a day. To talk of peace is not enough; we must hatch the eggs of
the dove.'
And that was it. A pearl, an emerald. Or so I thought at first, as the
orange glow of sunset streaked the horizon and pelicans wheeled.
But then I thought: what a beautiful sleight-of-hand. Magician-like, White
achieves his purpose - a toot for capitalism - by implying that the eggs of
the dove are safer if threatened by a capitalistic building programme than
if threatened by a state-driven one.
Which is nonsense. So far as I know, there is no particular evidence to
indicate that market-driven economies, or democracies, are better at
protecting the environment, or other species, than state-driven ones.
As a matter of fact, the worst abuses seem to occur when foreign-owned
enterprises of a capitalistic nature work hand-in-glove with the corrupt
servants of socialist, or centralist, regimes. To see that this is so, all
you need do is read Dale Peterson's The Deluge and the Ark, an account of
the pressures and deprivations facing many of the world's 180 species of
primate.
Worldwide, people now consume around 4bn cubic yards of wood annually,
enough to build a solid wooden highway to the moon. This is not good for the
primates, many of whose habitats are so threatened by the antics of loggers
and governments everywhere, and of every political tint, that almost half
are declining towards extinction.
My thought for the day: beware of stylish journalism. It can lure you into
the swamp.
