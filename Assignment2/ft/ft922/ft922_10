FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Falling glass prices hit Pilkington
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the glass-maker, is still struggling with glass prices 25 per
cent lower than two years ago in Europe and the US and 38 per cent in
Australia.
Even after slashing the second interim dividend to 3.07p (7.57p), the group
is taking Pounds 20.1m from reserves (Pounds 62.6m in the previous year) to
pay the 6p (10.5p) total. The near halving of pre-tax profits, from Pounds
151.6m to Pounds 77m, was at the bottom end of expectations.
The group took Pounds 23.1m exceptional redundancy and reorganisation costs
in the year and suffered another Pounds 13.9m charge when a US customer went
bankrupt.
Group turnover was barely lower at Pounds 2.6bn, and operating profits fell
12 per cent to Pounds 182.5m. These included a Pounds 15.2m (Pounds 9m)
profit on the sale of investments and Pounds 41.2m of profits from
businesses since sold or closed.
Net interest charges rose from Pounds 56.9m to Pounds 68.5m, giving interest
cover of 2.7 times. Mr Andrew Robb, finance director, said he was not happy
with this cover.
The tax rate was high at 54.5 per cent, mainly because of UK advance
corporation tax. Minorities took Pounds 25.5m (Pounds 22.9m) and there were
extraordinary profits, largely on the sale of businesses, of Pounds 17.7m
(costs Pounds 48.5m). Earnings per share before exceptional items were 5.5p
(8.6p) and after these costs were 1.2p (8.6p).
The group would have suffered a cash outflow but for Pounds 229.5m raised
from the sale of businesses. Net debt fell from Pounds 703m to Pounds 659m
over the year, 56 per cent (59 per cent) of shareholders' funds.
European glass operating profits fell from Pounds 127.8m to Pounds 67.4m,
with the UK and Nordic areas particularly badly hit, although German profits
were also lower. In North America profits improved slightly to Pounds 10.8m
(Pounds 9m) thanks to cost cuts. South American profits rose offsetting
falls in South Africa and Australia, leaving profits for the rest of the
world at Pounds 60.4m (Pounds 60.8m).
Poor flat glass profits were to some extent made up by improvements
elsewhere. The insulation business returned to profit making Pounds 1m (loss
Pounds 4.6m). Visioncare, the US spectacle and contact lens business made
Pounds 21.5m (Pounds 9.6m). Other businesses lost Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 10.3m)
and licensing income fell from Pounds 26.1m to Pounds 22.6m.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Oxford Instruments shares tumble on 29%
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Oxford Instruments underperformed a declining market by tumbling
10 per cent to 229p, as the advanced instrumentation company revealed a
sharper-than-expected 29 per cent fall in profits.
The pre-tax return of Pounds 8.6m for the year to March 29, struck on sales
5 per cent lower at Pounds 103.3m, was about Pounds 1m lower than analysts
had expected. Losses estimated at about Pounds 3m at three subsidiaries were
believed to have been responsible.
Mr Peter Williams, chairman and chief executive, held out little hope for an
improvement in the current year, saying that new orders were about 17 per
cent down to Pounds 95m on the previous year. He added, however, that the
decline appeared to have bottomed out and two of the three subsidiaries were
expected to return to the black this year.
The dividend is raised to 2.9p for a total of 4.3p (4.15p). Earnings per
share fell to 14.7p (16.8p).
The good news came from Oxford's joint venture with Siemens in magnetic body
scanners, which increased its profits contribution by 44 per cent to Pounds
5.1m. This was due to an increased share of a market which was largely
static, Mr Williams said.
Profits were also helped by the Pounds 1.2m tax benefit on the release of
provisions relating to asset disposals in 1991. The tax charge fell from
Pounds 3.99m to Pounds 1.45m.
Mr Williams stressed the continuing importance of research to Oxford
Instruments. The group spent Pounds 8.1m on research and development,
roughly equivalent to last year.
COMMENT
Oxford enjoys a roller coaster relationship with City sentiments: sometimes
up, sometimes down. Yesterday's results sent it hurtling towards earth. For
a start, Oxford's great hope, the synchrotron, may be working very well but
it has no orders for new ones; and the longer it has to wait for an an
economic upturn, the more chance competitors have to catch up. Furthermore,
the lead times are long and the semiconductor market is still flat on its
back. On the brighter side, the cash position is very strong and a lot of
work has been done to rein in costs without damaging research. Also, Oxford
enjoys a healthy lead in some interesting technical areas. But any recovery
will long term. Forecasts are for Pounds 8.5m, with a prospective p/e of
about 20 times. This is not a company for amateurs and certainly not for
short-termers.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Ratners sells Watches of Switzerland for
Pounds 23.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RATNERS GROUP, the struggling jewellery business, has sold its Watches of
Switzerland chain for Pounds 23.2m cash, helping to ease its strained
working capital position.
The buyer is Asprey, the luxury goods group centred on its flagship
jewellery store in London's Bond Street but which also includes Garrard, the
Crown Jewellers, and Mappin &amp; Webb.
Watches of Switzerland, which operated as an upmarket stand-alone business
within the Ratners portfolio, has experienced tough trading and saw pre-tax
profits fall from Pounds 2.69m to Pounds 887,000 last year on sales of
Pounds 21.7m. At February 1, it had net assets of Pounds 19.2m.
The chain has 25 stores throughout the UK and will help Asprey's strategic
aim of broadening its geographic coverage. It was brought into Ratners with
the acquisition of the H Samuel business in 1986.
Mr Jim McAdam, Ratners chairman, said he had achieved a 'fair price' for the
chain - although it is believed to have been far less than the company was
originally seeking.
Ratners will retain its interest in Watches of Switzerland's headquarters in
Aylesbury and may be able to benefit from recovery of past years'
corporation tax taking the value of the deal to Pounds 24m.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Welsh Water rises to Pounds 138m - Pledge
to limit price rises below regulator's target
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELSH WATER yesterday became the first of the ten privatised water and
sewerage companies to pledge to raise prices by less than already allowed by
Ofwat, the water regulator, until 1995.
The company said it would limit price increases to 5 per cent above the rate
of inflation, unless the situation changed 'exceptionally.'
The original price cap, set during the 1989 privatisation, was 6.5 per cent
above inflation until Ofwat's review in 1995.
All the water companies have agreed to limit price increases this year,
often in response to Ofwat pressure, but Welsh Water is the first to extend
its pledge.
Mr John Elfed Jones, chairman, said the new cap was a reward for customers.
Ofwat welcomed the move. 'It will help consumers' pockets,' the regulator
said.
But the decision was poorly received on the stock market, where the shares
fell 16p to 451p. SG Warburg, the broker, estimated that the price cap would
reduce profits by Pounds 4m-Pounds 5m a year.
Pre-tax profits increased 8 per cent from Pounds 128m to Pounds 138m in the
year to March 31.
Turnover increased 17 per cent to Pounds 342m (Pounds 293m), mainly due to
average price rises of 16.2 per cent. Prices are set to rise a further 9.3
per cent this year.
At the interim stage, Welsh profits rose 7 per cent to Pounds 78m (Pounds
72.7m)
Net interest income fell from Pounds 33.2m to Pounds 18.2m due to increased
capital investment of Pounds 189m. Earnings per share rose to 88.4p (82.2p).
The proposed final dividend of 14.27p (13p) raises the total for the year to
21.4p (19.5p).
The company's non-regulated businesses, which were developed aggressively
following privatisation, performed poorly. There was a Pounds 600,000
trading loss from an environmental services associate, and a Pounds 300,000
loss on its disposal.
Hamdden, its hotel and leisure group, had a 'disappointing' year.
Dividend income of Pounds 3.5m was earned from the 15 per cent stake in
South Wales Electricity. The electricity company regards the stake as
unwelcome and is refusing to discuss possible joint ventures.
COMMENT
Will Welsh's price cap be enough to pre-empt the regulator, or is it simply
further proof of how generously the company's K allowance was set? Certainly
the regulator may decide that if Welsh can forego 1.5 per cent price rises
voluntarily, it can do without at least that much again without causing any
damage. Equally worrying was Welsh's insistence that its diversification
policy has been 'cautious' when most in the City would describe it as
anything but. If Welsh is merely paying lip-service to the regulator, so be
it. But if the company has really changed its mind about the non-core
business, some of the premium accorded in expectation of higher, non-core
growth must now be reviewed. Forecast profits for this year of Pounds 144m
put the shares on 4.9 times, with a yield of 6.5. But until such questions
are answered, and the re-jigged management is up and running, Welsh may
continue to see selling pressure.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Buoyant British Land rises 7.4%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Ritblat, chairman of British Land, yesterday called the turn in the
UK property market. 'For the first time since 1989 we think we have now seen
the worst,' he said.
His remarks accompanied the announcement of a 7.4 per cent rise in profits
from Pounds 31.0m to Pounds 33.3m for the year to March 31. Net assets per
share fell 18 per cent from 401p to 329p.
Mr Ritblat, a veteran of the 1974 property crash when British Land's share
price dropped to 3.5p, said this property slump was 'far more serious' than
that of the early 1970s.
However, he said he thought that investors in good quality property were
beginning to come back to the market, even though it would take several
years for rental values to improve.
'Markets may be flat and difficult, but we believe that they will respond to
a selectively improving trend,' he said.
Mr Ritblat said he did not expect further write-downs in his portfolio this
year. He hoped that writing down book values by 60 per cent over three years
in the City of London, the worst-affected investment market, had 'removed
any further downside from the equation'.
British Land's Pounds 2bn portfolio fell by 10.48 per cent with a 31 per
cent drop in the value of its City of London property, a 22 per cent fall in
the rest of London, a 7 per cent rise in provincial property and a 1 per
cent fall in its overseas properties.
The overall yield on the property moved up from 7.2 per cent to 8.1 per
cent.
The general decline in property values was partly offset by new purchases,
which were valued at more than cost.
British Land has spent about Pounds 900m on property during the downturn.
Last year it bought Pounds 230m of property and sold property worth Pounds
100m.
Gross rents rose by 30.6 per cent to Pounds 127m. The company's gearing has
risen from 72 per cent to 98 per cent, treating convertible capital bonds as
equity.
Earnings per share rose from 10.8p to 12.5p. A final dividend of 4.28p was
declared, making a total of 6.35p (against 5.75p last time). British Land's
share price rose 10p to 214p.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Sotheby's chairman to sell 8m shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alfred Taubman, chairman of Sotheby's Holdings, is to sell 8m of his
shares in the auction house. The sale is expected to raise Dollars 100m
(Pounds 55m).
Mr Max M. Fisher, vice chairman, and the Martinique Hotel Inc, are to offer
between them another 2m shares.
Mr Taubman will retain around 14m shares in Sotheby's and voting control.
There was no trading in Sotheby's shares in New York yesterday but on
Wednesday they closed at Dollars 12 3/4 . It is expected that when the offer
goes out at the end of the month the price will be around this figure.
Two million of the Class A shares, which have limited voting rights, will be
offered outside the US and Canada.
Mr Taubman, who paid Pounds 80m for Sotheby's in 1983, sold around 2.6m
shares in 1988 at Dollars 18 a share, raising Dollars 47m.
He has written to Sotheby's employees saying that his commitment to, and
confidence in, Sotheby's remains unimpaired and that he expects to continue
as chairman for some time.
Sotheby's is currently recuperating from the recession in the art market. In
the first quarter of 1992, it incurred a loss of Dollars 5.2m, but this is
always its weakest time of the year. In 1991 it made a pre-tax profit of
Dollars 21.5m, against Dollars 154.5m in the previous year, but it believes
that the worst is now over.
It has long been rumoured that Mr Taubman, a Detroit property developer with
a large interest in shopping centres, was wearying of his investment in
Sotheby's.
He helped to widen the demand for art, particularly for Impressionist and
modern pictures, which experienced a dramatic rise, and fall, in values.
He also enjoyed the social prestige which came from owning the world's
largest auction house.
But the collapse of the Impressionist market in 1989 badly affected
Sotheby's turnover and profits. It is now concentrating on connoisseur
markets, such as Old Master pictures, furniture, and silver, rather than on
speculative modern art.
Mr Taubman has also been affected by the fall in property values in the US.
One of his achievements was to obtain planning permission to build
apartments above Sotheby's auction rooms in Manhattan's York Avenue. These
plans have been postponed.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Kalon in hostile bid for paints rival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KALON GROUP, the West Yorkshire-based paint manufacturer, yesterday launched
a hostile Pounds 106.1m bid for Manders (Holdings), the Wolverhampton
paints, inks and property group.
The eight-for-three all-paper offer values each ordinary Manders share at
about 288p. Manders' shares closed up 54p at 291p while Kalon's fell 2 1/2 p
to 108p.
Mr Mike Hennessy, Kalon managing director, said the offer price represented
a 24 per cent premium to the Manders closing price on Wednesday June 10.
He said Manders was an 'underperforming manufacturing business', though it
also owned the Mander Centre, worth Pounds 57.5m, in Wolverhampton. The
combination of Manders' activities had been 'unsuccessful'. Since 1987 it
had spent more than Pounds 23m on acquisitions, but 1991 pre-tax profits at
Pounds 6.04m compared with Pounds 6.12 in 1988. Manders' shareholders had
suffered, he said. The offer would allow them to benefit from Kalon's
management strengths.
Mr Roy Amos, Manders chairman, said the news of yesterday's bid had 'come
out of the blue', adding that the last contact between the two rivals had
been five years ago when Manders had bid for Kalon.
He described Kalon's move as 'opportunistic' in the light of the current
strength of its share price. The 'unsolicited' offer undervalued Manders,
which was in a 'major transitional period'. He added that the bid was 'not
in anyone's interest, not the employees, not the customers, not the
shareholders'.
Kalon said the two groups had complementary paints businesses, and expected
the enlarged group to have turnover of Pounds 200m. Mr Hennessy envisaged
closing one of the enlarged group's four factories - Windeck in Bingley -
and reducing the combined workforce by 20 per cent.
Kalon was formed in 1985 by the merger of Leyland Paint &amp; Wallpaper with a
private paint company and brought in Mr Hennessy in 1988 to oversee its
reorganisation. In 1988 pre-tax profits were Pounds 3.72m; in 1991 they were
Pounds 9.2m, a growth rate of 36 per cent a year. Over the past four years
Kalon's share price has risen 140 per cent relative to the FT-A All-Share
Index.

FT  12 JUN 92 / S&amp;P cuts Barclays credit rating and reviews NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DETERIORATION in the balance sheet strength of Barclays and National
Westminster, the UK's two largest banks, has led to a further decline in
their credit quality, according to Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating
agency.
S&amp;P yesterday downgraded the rating of Barclays by one notch from AA+ to AA.
It is now two notches below the top triple-A credit rating which it lost
last year.
NatWest has been placed under review for possible downgrade from AA+, a
process which usually leads to a cut in rating. The rating outlook for Royal
Bank of Scotland has also been changed from stable to negative.
Mr Barry Hancock, analyst at S&amp;P in London, said: 'Our decision reflects
structural changes in the balance sheet condition of the banks and in the
operating environment.' In particular, Barclays and NatWest have not raised
risk capital from the equity market in recent years and have not generated
capital from retained earnings, he said. Instead, both have issued
'quasi-equity' instruments in the capital markets. Last year NatWest issued
Pounds 140m preference shares in the UK and raised Dollars 250m preference
capital in the US.
Preference shares count as capital under the Basle Accord on international
bank capital adequacy and EC banking regulations which set minimum
capital-to-assets ratios. However, credit rating agencies do not regard
preference shares as pure equity capital.
According to S&amp;P, Barclays' ratio of risk capital - which includes ordinary
shares, reserves and minority interests but excludes property revaluation
reserves - to assets has fallen from 7.78 per cent in 1988 to 5.77 per cent
in 1991. NatWest's ratio has fallen from 7.73 per cent to 6.17 per cent over
the same period.
S&amp;P was the first of the big agencies to lower the credit ratings of the two
UK clearers from the top triple-A level. It downgraded NatWest in August
1990 and Barclays in February last year. Moody's, its US rival, downgraded
Barclays from triple-A last month. Moody's said yesterday that it had no
plans to review the ratings of either bank.
IBCA, the UK rating agency, looked at the ratings of both banks last month
but left them unchanged at AA+.

FT  12 JUN 92 / EC should relinquish powers to member states, says Brittan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission should propose handing certain centralised powers
back to European Community member-states to demonstrate that the commission
is not 'a body wanting power for its own sake', Sir Leon Brittan,
commissioner for competition, said yesterday.
Trying to stem the tide against the Maastricht treaty, Sir Leon suggested
that he and his fellow members on the EC executive should ask the Council of
Ministers to repeal legislation 'where it has gone too far or has achieved
its original purpose and is no longer needed'.
Last week's Danish referendum rejecting the treaty has led to growing
scepticism about European union and highlighted particularly the question of
how much power should be vested in community institutions.
However, Sir Leon, who was speaking in Florence, had only two pieces of
legislation to propose for possible repeal.
He suggested that EC norms on drinking water had served their purpose by
'raising consciousness and acting as a catalyst' and could now be handed
over to national parliaments to supervise and maybe amend.
He also questioned whether the common EC passports were necessary.
The speech was the first time a commissioner has gone beyond urging
legislative self-restraint on Brussels to propose a repeal of redundant EC
laws and rules.
The speech also shows the increasing feeling in Brussels, as well as in
Britain - which takes over the Council of Ministers' presidency from
Portugal next month - that the only way to save the Maastricht treaty may be
by emphasising 'subsidiarity', or states' rights.
In the run-up to the Danish referendum, Mr Jacques Delors, commission
president, had been casting around in the environmental field for a way of
proving his belief in subsidiarity. But he failed to come up with a solid
proposal in time to influence Danish opinion.
Sir Leon said that he was responding to the widespread feeling that the
community was a one-way-street, constantly funnelling power towards the
centre.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Perot faces moment of truth: Little old lady upsets apple
cart of the master of folksy aphorisms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOMENTS OF political truth do not often happen on sunny Thursday mornings in
June, but there is no reason why they should not. One may have happened to
Mr Ross Perot just after eight east coast time yesterday.
The prospective independent candidate for the White House had breezed
through the first hour on Today, NBC TV's breakfast time show, taking calls
from the public and some questions from Katie Couric, the presenter.
He had happily agreed to blast away for an extra hour, intent on upsetting
the establishment apple cart.
Then an obviously elderly woman asked a seemingly innocuous question: Mr
Perot did not really want to take away social security benefits from retired
people with incomes of more than Dollars 60,000 a year, did he?
The Perot response was, to put it mildly, involved. It began with an
accusation that the Bush administration was maligning him, it digressed into
a discussion he had had four years ago with 'a prominent national economist'
about 1988 figures which now needed updated computerised number crunching.
It wandered into the fact that he was wealthy enough himself not to need
social security, it invoked the spirit of hope in the musical Annie, and it
said old people were always making sacrifices for the young.
At the end of which, the little old lady, asked by a bemused Ms Couric if
she was satisfied, bravely said: 'I don't think he really answered the
question.'
This set Mr Perot off again on the same tack. 'If people say 'I've got mine
and the heck with you' then we're all sunk.'
But his eyes had narrowed and he did not look pleased that someone who was
not a professional journalist had dared to demur from what he had himself
proclaimed to be the self-evident truth.
Talk-and-celebrity show app-earances are now de rigueur for political
candidates. Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas is doing it all the time and
this week the White House confirmed that President George Bush had agreed to
appear on two such programmes, one with his wife, Barbara, when he returns
from Rio.
Mr Perot is a master of the folksy aphorism and yesterday's performance was
stuffed with them. The balanced budget amendment now before Congress 'is an
excuse not to do anything'. And again: 'We throw away more money than we
print right now.'
Mr Bush, he said, sent delegations to Iraq before the Gulf war 'to burp,
diaper and pamper Saddam Hussein'. National health care reform was 'like
buying a new car - you check it out'.
But glints of real policy also shine through the soundbites and one clear
element of Mr Perot's is going to be to blame pernicious foreigners for many
of America's domestic ills.
Thus, borrowing from the well-known anti-Japanese polemicist, Mr Pat Choate,
he squarely put the blame for the plight of American dairy farmers on
foreign interests. His words yesterday bear quoting at length.
'Make it illegal for foreign nations, foreign companies, foreign
individuals, to lobby the US Congress or to get money directly or indirectly
in any way, and make it illegal for former government officials to cash in
by making Dollars 25,000 or Dollars 30,000 a month lobbying for foreign
countries,' he said.
Americans like this sort of language, more, at present, than Mr Bush's
contradictions and Mr Clinton's finely measured wordiness. But like the
little old lady worried about her social security, not everybody yet
understands - or agrees with - Ross Perot.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Help sought in tracing Maxwell funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANTS trying to trace the assets of the late Robert Maxwell yesterday
called on the government to put diplomatic pressure on Liechtenstein and
Switzerland to help unlock information held in secretive foreign trusts.
Mr Peter Phillips, a partner with accountancy firm Buchler Phillips and
receiver to Mr Maxwell's personal estate, said he needed high-level support
to identify funds held in more than a dozen trusts in several countries.
Mr Phillips, who has traced up to Pounds 10m of Mr Maxwell's assets, said:
'Now the government has started using words like crime and fraud in relation
to the Maxwell case, it should come out of its shell and offer help to
groups trying to recover assets.'
His views reflect the concerns of others searching for assets stolen from
pensioners and creditors to the Maxwell empire who have found their work
blocked by regulations to maintain secrecy.
They believe that substantial assets may have been either channelled
through, or be currently placed in, offshore trusts which are refusing to
co-operate.
Mr Neil Cooper, the partner at accountancy firm Robson Rhodes who is
liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management - manager and trustee of the
Maxwell pension funds - said he had been offered no assistance from the
government in his search.
'We need jurisdictions overseas to recognise the special nature of this
case, in which we are tracing stolen assets,' he said. 'That sets it aside
from the normal secrecy and privacy conditions by which these countries
operate.'
He said investigators had no sense of the total value of assets which may
have been held in offshore trusts, and had not been able to see their
accounts or interview their directors.
Other accountants attempting to trace assets include partners at Arthur
Andersen, administrators to more than 400 companies in the private Maxwell
business empire.
The government said it would provide help to those tracing Maxwell assets
through a special unit, the creation of which Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, announced in the Commons on Monday.
The Department of Social Security said it would hold discussions with anyone
able to assist in returning stolen assets either in the UK or abroad.
It saw no need to involve the Foreign Office in diplomatic discussions. The
unit is expected to be operating within a few days, and is currently
assembling civil servants and private sector employees to work in it.
The appointment of a chairman drawn from the private sector with financial
experience is expected to be announced early next week.
Mr Cooper said: 'We wait to see if the government is prepared to extend the
channels being proposed to put pressure on banks and institutions to other
institutions and to other states. We would welcome any assistance that could
be given.'
The assets identified by Mr Phillips includes about Pounds 3m from a
Frankfurt office building sold earlier this year and traced to a bank
account in France.

Thinking caps on, please, on behalf of Ukraine. As if creating an
independent country for the first time in three centuries and dealing with
the wreckage left by 70 years of communism were not enough, the young nation
is still struggling to cope with the effect of history's worst nuclear
accident.
In its desperation, the government has turned to a novel approach. It has
announced an international public competition for ways to prevent the
unreliable cement sarcaphagus which covers the melted-down Chernobyl
reactor, from cracking and releasing another deadly cloud of radiation.
Any reader who can work out a solution is invited to submit it to the
Ministry for Chernobyl, No 1 Lesia Ukrainka Square, Kiev, Ukraine. Alas, in
its haste to inform the world of the competition, the government has so far
neglected to specify the prize.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Observer: Exit of kin
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is rare to find family companies where the family knows when to quit. But
Kalon, which has just made a hostile bid for fellow paint-maker Manders, is
one such.
Leslie Silver, who founded the company in 1947, packed his bags a few months
ago, sold the family's 47 per cent stake and went off to enjoy his
retirement chairing the board of Leeds United. His son and various
sons-in-law, who might have enjoyed running their inheritance, had already
stepped down from the board and handed over to professional managers.
The handover is all the more remarkable because, before Silver's exit, the
company had no non-executive directors, and had to turn to Sir Adrian
Cadbury's quango Proned to find Silver's replacement, Roger Boissier.
'I never wanted to create a dynasty', says Silver who, now 67, started the
business with a Pounds 250 gratuity on leaving the Royal Air Force. He
remains faithful to his old firm, describing the bid for Manders as 'a
sensible and logical marriage'. But then he can afford to be generous now he
has sold almost all of his Kalon shares.
Despite the obvious loyalty of many Kalon shareholders, the speed with which
the new team wants to celebrate the Silver family's departure by issuing
huge amounts of paper, may well ring an alarm bell or two.

If so, and they're wondering why, the answer may lie in a 'very special

Meanwhile, not even the Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty on
monetary union has slowed the momentum behind the bids from cities across
Europe to house the European Central Bank. With public relations machines
from Edinburgh to Barcelona in overdrive, the mere fact that the ECB might
never happen has failed to hold back the campaigns.
For instance, Sir Brian Jenkins, Lord Mayor of London, has just set off on
yet another trip, this time to convince the Spanish and the Belgians that
his city is the most serious contender. Only last month he was in Paris
talking to its mayor Jacques Chirac in pursuit of the City's Pounds 1.5m
drive to capture the ECB.
Oddly enough, the mayor of Frankfurt is heading for London the week after
next - could his trip be in any way related? After all, the Bundesbank has
just rented the top 15 floors of Frankfurt's Messeturm, Europe's tallest
building. It would make a fine address for a central bank.
Perhaps England's Old Lady should follow suit by speculatively taking the
odd cubic mile of Canary Wharf.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Observer: Exceptions to the rule
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At a time like this, publishers surely ought to be trampling over one
another for the story of the heir to the throne's romantic liaison with his
former housekeeper.
Not so, however, when the heir concerned is the pretender to the throne of
France, Henri, Count of Paris. There apparently isn't much of a market
either for revelations about the private lives of the royalty of other
continental countries.
Take the Netherlands, for instance, where the liveliest such issue is the
health of Prince Claus, the German-born husband of Queen Beatrix. Although
he has lately resumed his official duties, he went to hospital in 1991 for a
recurrence of the depression for which he was treated in a Swiss clinic in
the early 1980s. He also has a mild form of Parkinson's disease.
Then again, Sweden's King Carl-Gustav is known to suffer from dyslexia. But
despite being married to the popular Queen Silvia, also German-born and a
graduate of the Munich interpreters' school, he is scarcely a hot topic, not
least because his duties these days do not even extend to opening
parliament.
Nevertheless the Dutch and the Swedish royals are controversial figures by
comparison with their counterparts in Germany, which hasn't had a monarch
since the abdication of Kaiser Wilhelm after the First World War. The last
time the Kaiser's heirs caught public attention was four years ago, when one
of his great-nephews shot himself near an Austrian lake after finding his
wife dead from a drugs overdose.
All of which raises the question of whether, regardless of the Danes,
creeping Euro-harmonisation will eventually threaten the British royal
family with similar obscurity - and, if so, how the House of Windsor would
look on the prospect of dropping not just out of the headlines, but out of
the news altogether.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Arts: A Better Day - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was a good idea to write a musical about Keir Hardie and to stage it at
the old socialist stronghold of the Theatre Royal, Stratford East. Not only
was he the founder of the Independent Labour Party, he won a famous
by-election in what was then the local constituency of West Ham South in
1892. There was also a romantic side to him, notably his love affair with
Sylvia Pankhurst, the suffragette, and indeed with several Fabian ladies.
All the ingredients for a boisterous, irreverent, participatory performance
are there. The author is Sheila Yeger, whose writing we have learned to
admire not least from her recent Self-Portrait, a play about the artist,
Gwen John. The director is Annie Casteldine, who is up among the top. Do not
be put off by the piece being commissioned by Nalgo; there could be worse
things for a trade union to do than getting into theatre.
Yet the trouble is that A Better Day does not quite come off - or at least
not yet. One is reminded of Professor Dahrendorf's remark about Edward
Heath's manifesto 'A Better Tomorrow'; what he really meant was a better
yesterday. It would be pleasant to report that the shortcomings on the first
night were due to the performance being too slow, which it was. However,
there may be a deeper reason, which is that socialism is neither funny nor
self-confident any more: it's dead. I never expected to sit through a
rendering of 'Jerusalem' in this theatre with the audience scarcely having
the enthusiasm to join in.
That is at the end of the first act. The second act, which is generally much
better, has a performance of 'The Red Flag' which, whatever you may think of
the words, has a pretty stirring tune. It comes across like a dirge.
Some lines in the text bear out the interpretation that few people, even in
Stratford East, are prepared to cheer for socialism any more. Keir Hardie
condemns the idea of a Lib-Lab pact, which was as much talked about at the
start of the 20th century as it is towards the end. There is no applause for
his advice that socialists should have nothing to do with it; only what I
took to be a thoughtful silence.
A Better Day has its lacunae. One of the lines is 'When in doubt, sing'. In
the absence of sustained dialogue, that could be the guiding principle of
the piece. Stratford East has always been good at that sort of thing. And
when Elizabeth Mansfield as Sylvia Pankhurst leads her cohorts in 'If you
wont't give the vote to the ladies, there'll be no more kisses for you', the
old place is back at its best. The show is worth seeing for Ms Mansfield
alone, as well as the nostalgia.
Hardie died in 1915. Obviously he had a way with women. One of his girl
friends, Agnes Hughes - played here by Shona Morris - claims in her diaries
that she had a communication with him through a medium in 1945. She said he
expressed his doubts that the newly elected Labour government would stick to
the guidelines of the Sermon on the Mount. One awaits with fascination a new
biography of Hardie by Caroline Benn to be published this summer. Meanwhile,
don't overlook Stratford East.

Peter Walker, the former Conservative cabinet minister and now a life peer,
has added the chairmanship of Cornhill Insurance to his list of boardroom
responsibilities, reviving an insurance connection which stretches back to
the early 1950's.
Walker made his debut in the City as an insurance broker, forming Walker
Young, which was one of the building blocks of the Slater Walker empire.
The appointment combines Walker's long experience in insurance with his
pronounced pro-European sympathies. Germany's Allianz, Europe's biggest
insurance company, took over Cornhill in 1986.
Walker, who will head a seven-man German-style supervisory board, takes over
from Cecil Burrows, 70, who has been with Cornhill since 1938 and chairman
since 1988.
The new chairman is not promising any fireworks at this stage - but some
steady expansion could clearly be on the cards.
Since 1986 Cornhill's share of the UK general insurance market has remained
stubbornly low at around 3 per cent. The formidable German company is not
normally content to play a minor role.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
if not necessarily cosy - world, it should be no surprise that Paul Luke,
formerly economic adviser at Chartered WestLB, has turned up at Morgan
Grenfell working for Rick Haller. The two know each other from consortium
bank Libra.
The puzzle is rather that Luke did not come earlier. For when Libra was
wound up in 1990, most of its LDC debt-trading operation, under Haller,
moved to Morgan Grenfell.
Luke, however, considered joining Morgan 'the easy option' and decided to
'sever the umbilical cord', moving to the Standard Chartered/WestLB joint
venture. There he fitted into another team which had left Libra in 1987.
Two years after Libra's demise, Luke becomes a director and head of research
and investment strategy at Morgan Grenfell Debt Arbitrage and Trading
(MGDAT). Although Chartered WestLB has not failed to make its mark in the
LDC field, MGDAT has done a lot better - contributing healthy profits last
year in contrast to some of Morgan Grenfell's more traditional parts.
MGDAT is now ranked fourth in the world after three big American banks. Its
turnover for the first five months of 1992 was more than Dollars 22bn,
compared with Dollars 15.9bn for the whole of 1991 at Chartered WestLB, says
Luke.
As a 'self-confessed professional Welshman', Luke expects his old employer
to be concerned principally that it has lost the captain of its newly formed
rugby team, the Chartered WestLBeasts.
Chartered WestLB's new economic adviser is Peter West, who joins from the
United Nations Commission for Latin America and the Caribbean after a varied
career specialising in Latin America. 'He has on-the-ground experience which
Paul did not,' says managing director Peter Sargeant.

Bob Beeston, new chief executive at engineering group FKI, has reorganised
the management structure and brought in two of his former colleagues from
BTR, the industrial conglomerate. At the same time, Alan Baxter, a main
board director primarily responsible for the UK operation, has announced his
resignation. A reorganisation into five main divisions centred around
products and markets, rather than geography, meant Baxter could not be
offered a job of the same status, the company said. His departure represents
a weakening of ex-GEC links at the top of FKI. Both Baxter and Norman
Scoular, the previous chief executive of FKI, came from GEC.
The new divisional heads, none of whom joins the main board, include two of
Beeston's former colleagues from BTR valves. Robert Sook will head material
handling and Bill McClure comes in as group controller under the finance
director. They will bring 'some of the discipline on profit planning that we
had at BTR', Beeston said yesterday.
The other new divisional heads are: Joe Withers, hardware; Richard Jones,
automotive; James Beckett, engineering; Barry Jameson, process control.
Steven Jones is director of corporate planning.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Kingfisher retailing conglomerate appears to be girding its loins for
overseas expansion by yesterday appointing one of its leading retailers to
the post of international development director.
He is Jim Hodkinson, 48, a dynamic, straight-talking executive who helped
develop B&amp;Q into a strong market leader in the DIY field.
For several years, Kingfisher has been investigating the possibilities of
expansion in mainland Europe, in the electrical retailing and DIY markets in
particular, but has so far been frustrated through lack of suitable
acquisition opportunities.
'We have been looking at Europe in our spare time so to speak and we did not
think that was sufficient to drive the process,' the company said yesterday.
Hodkinson will relinquish the post of deputy chairman and chief executive at
B&amp;Q to take up the new post but will remain on the company's board as a
non-executive director. His new job notwithstanding, he still intends to
fulfil a long-held desire to retire at 50 and spend the considerable wealth
he has amassed in a varied business career.
His move neatly solves the succession question at B&amp;Q as it makes room for
Alan Smith, currently managing director of Superdrug, to take on the top
role. Smith will temporarily be replaced at Superdrug by Woolworth's
property director Roger Jones until a full-time successor is found.

FT  12 JUN 92 / The Property Market: Doing it the Coin Street way
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
London's least conventional property development occupies one of the
capital's most promising sites: a sweeping bend of the Thames with
magnificent views stretching from Parliament to St Paul's.
Tucked in between the towering offices of IPC and Sea Containers House on
one side and the grey hulk of the Royal National Theatre on the other, is a
complex comprising a park, low-rise housing, off-beat craft shops and
restaurants.
Its centrepiece is a South Bank landmark, a tower with intricate motifs
spelling out the word Oxo - a reminder of the days when the tower was a
distribution centre for meats products including Oxo. Beneath the motif
flaps a banner with the words: 'GLC working for London. Welcome to Coin
Street. Homes and Jobs. A community victory.'
This relic of the long-gone Greater London Council fluttering atop an
apparently derelict building continues to attract attention from developers
jealously eyeing what is undoubtedly one of London's best sites.
For sure, the 5.5 hectare site is accustomed to attracting attention. In the
late 1980s, it was the subject of a controversial and bitterly-fought
planning battle.
After two public inquiries, property developers Greycoat, which wanted to
build 1m square ft of office space on the site, threw in the towel in 1984.
The site was then sold by the GLC to a co-operative of community builders -
the Coin Street Community Builders (CSCB) - for Pounds 1m, perhaps half its
value, just days before the Tory government acted to curb spending by the
GLC before its eventual abolition soon after. Instead of office blocks, the
new owners let it be known that the site would be used for parks, affordable
housing and workshops
Nearly a decade on, Coin Street and its relationship with the rest of the
South Bank is at a turning point. Stamford Wharf, the building that bears
the Oxo tower, is to be redeveloped.
By autumn 1993, Coin Street Community Builders hope to turn Stamford Wharf
into a complex of cafes, restaurants, performance and exhibition spaces,
rented housing and craft workshops. The developers hope to produce a
genuinely mixed-use development for Stamford Wharf, ensuring that the
vitality of the area does not ebb away in the evenings and at weekends.
The Coin Street developers say they have secured the necessary Pounds 20m of
funds from a mix of public and private sources and contracts have already
been put out to tender. If the scheme does proceed to plan, it will be be a
notable achievement in an area where other regeneration plans - the South
Bank arts centre for instance - are on hold, victims of the recession.
The aim of all developments in the area has been to enhance the South Bank,
for long the poor relation of the north side of the Thames. The siting of
County Hall and later, the Festival of Britain, on the South Bank were
previous attempts to correct the imbalance.
Indeed, Coin Street was originally mooted to reverse the area's declining
residential population, which shrank from 50,000 in the 1930s to 5,000 by
the 1970s, the consequence of floods, bombing, the disbandment of wharfs and
relocation of industry.
Coin Street has been the subject of planning arguments since the early 1970s
when Heron Corporation proposed building Europe's tallest hotel on the site.
A combination of developers' ambition and neighbouring councils' high rates
and insistence on socially desirable but financially unviable schemes
blighted the area for years.
Local residents set up in 1977 the Coin Street Action Group, having earlier
established a housing association to make available low cost housing. CSCB
decided from the outset to develop the site in phases. Instead of hiding the
development sites behind corrugated iron, it put the land into temporary use
as parks and car parks. The most imaginative temporary project is Gabriel's
Wharf, where the developers erected garages, painted a backdrop of mock
Georgian facades and installed craft workshops.
Work on redeveloping Stamford Wharf is due to start in the summer.
Thereafter, a plot of land near Waterloo has been earmarked for housing and
an exhibition centre.
Clearly the action group - which includes printers, pensioners, a docker, a
deliveryman and a telephonist - is doing it its own way. 'Coin Street: There
is another way . . . ' is CSCB's slogan - a reference to the character, mix
and management of the developments.
To bring the 'alternative' nature of the project home, the riverside park
has been renamed after one of the area's doughtiest campaigners against
office development. 'London needs another office block like it needs another
plague,' reads a poster in the community group's headquarters.
Yet the community group's opposition to the development of more offices in
London, which it argued passionately in the public inquiries of the early
1980s, is misguided. Contrary to CSCB's predictions, an acute shortage of
modern offices arose in London in the mid-1980s.
However, the virtues of the Coin Street scheme are only too apparent.
Plastering London with office blocks has been shown to make little sense.
Mr Iain Tuckett, Coin Street's company secretary, says the Coin Street
experience shows that there is huge scope for community groups to determine
the kind development they want in their area. 'The private market will do
what is most profitable, that is its job. The public sector will fill in the
worst gaps. There is a huge middle area,' he says.
He maintains that the Coin Street activists, far from being woolly-headed
idealists, have succeeded where others failed. 'No one else could persuade
local authorities, government and banks to chip in. The public and private
sector could not do it for 30 years,' he says.
But the notion that Coin Street is blazing a trail that could be widely
followed is probably wrong. The area had extraordinary advantages. With GLC
backing, the group was able to buy the site cheaply, covering its interest
costs from income from the car parks to the back of the South Bank.
As well as providing comfort for its bankers, this income has allowed the
group to subsidise its housing programme. Also, proximity to one of the most
famous art complexes in Europe gives a huge boost to local shops and
restaurants.
Yet despite its alternative image Coin Street's approach has more in common
with other developers than might be expected. Mr Tuckett says that the
experience of two inquiries and constant surveillance of developers' plans
taught CSCB some of the tricks of a developer's trade.
Certainly the absence of the profit motive creates an important difference
between Coin Street and other developers, says Mr Tuckett. But a profit-free
environment hardly makes the Coin Street developers a soft touch, says Mr
Tuckett. 'We are commercial; we have to be commercial,' he adds.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: 'Red route' network to be widened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday announced plans for a 300-mile network of 'red
routes' for London, designed to improve traffic flow in the capital.
Mr Steve Norris, junior transport minister, told the Commons of proposals
for the schemes after 18-month pilot projects in north and east London.
The announcement could pave the way for similar plans in other cities, with
Birmingham, Belfast, Hull and Leeds studying the capital's trials. Edinburgh
is also understood to be interested.
Red routes, officially known as priority routes, curb stopping by vehicles
to allow easy passage for through traffic. Restricted areas are shown by
prominent red kerbside markings and 'no stopping' lines.
Fears that businesses will suffer through the extension of the red route
network were discounted by Mr Norris.
His view was strongly disputed by Labour MPs representing constituencies in
north and east London, and questioned by Mr Peter Brooke, Tory MP for City
of London and Westminster south and a former cabinet minister.
Mr Norris insisted that there was 'no demonstrable link whatever' between
red routes and reduction in business for local shops and other
establishments.
Mr Brooke said: 'The perception of my constituency is very much in the
opposite direction.' He called for an assurance that, if necessary,
amendments would be made to the roads designated as red routes.
Mr Norris promised that 'if the department is wrong it will change its
mind'.
He accused some Labour critics of persisting with tactics that had been
employed during the general election, when the issue of red routes was used
'as a stick to beat Conservative candidates'.
Highlighting the benefits he said had been revealed by the pilot scheme, Mr
Norris added that overall journey times had improved by 25 per cent, while
road casualties fell by more than 200 in 1991 - a fall of some 36 per cent
compared with 12 per cent in London as a whole.
Mr Norris stressed that the journey times of buses had been cut by more than
10 per cent and their reliability improved by a third, resulting in wider
use of them.
Dealing with the traffic problems in the centre of London, he explained that
initially the designated red route would be virtually confined to the inner
ring road, roughly encompassing the area around the main railway stations.
As traffic using Tower Bridge, which formed part of the inner ring road, was
subject to a weight restriction a route via London Bridge would also be
designated.
Mr Norris said the main objectives in the centre of London were to help the
movement of buses and local commercial traffic rather than to serve
longer-distance movements.
He expected the first of the new red routes to be in operation by the end of
next year.
Road traffic increased by 1 per cent in the first quarter of this year
compared with the same period of 1991, according to figures issued yesterday
by the Department of Transport. However, the increase was mainly due to the
leap-year quarter being one day longer.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hospital delays are attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT came under fierce attack in the Commons yesterday for failing
to live up to its past commitments regarding hospital waiting lists.
Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, seized on provisional figures
showing a 25 per cent April increase in those waiting more than two years
for treatment to accuse the government of failing to keep a promise made
'purely for electoral purposes'.
Figures released by the health department showed that the number of people
waiting for hospital operations rose from 1,600 in March to 1,999 at the end
of April.
The patients' charter guaranteed that after April 1 nobody would wait longer
than two years, Mr Hattersley said. 'Did the government ever really mean it,
or was that just pre-election propaganda?'
He asked: 'What do you say to those citizens who . . now find they have had
to wait for more than two years because the government failed to keep its
promise that it made purely for electoral purposes?'
Mr Newton pointed to the 'huge improvement' that had been delivered in the
months leading up to April. 'To regard a reduction in the number of patients
waiting over two years from over 50,000 to less than 2,000 in a year is
hardly a failure of ambition.'
The former social security secretary admitted, however, that the 'small
increase' in queues registered during April was 'obviously a disappointment'
and promised the situation was being addressed.

NORTHERN Ireland's political leaders yesterday held an intensive series of
meetings without any resolution of the problems which have deadlocked the
inter-party talks on the province's political future.
After nine hours of negotiations in Belfast, a brief statement said only
that further meetings would be held today.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, has been exploring if, or
when, talks might move to the second 'strand' - involving the Irish
government. So far discussions have been only on possible systems of
devolution for Northern Ireland.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Science to get 'higher profile'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A WHITE PAPER setting out the government's proposals for giving a higher
profile to science and technology in Britain will be published in the early
part of next year, Mr William Waldegrave, minister for public service and
science, told the Commons last night.
In his first speech since being given responsibility for the newly created
office of science and technology he acknowledged the need for an improved
performance in translating invention into innovation where it really counted
 -in the market place.
Mr Jeremy Bray, from Labour's front bench, urged him to ensure that the
white paper dealt with policy aims as well as organisation.
Ms Anne Campbell, Labour MP for Cambridge, highlighted the growing loss of
scientists to Britain. She said the proportion of Fellows of the Royal
Society living in the US had increased from 4 per cent in the early 1960s,
to 13 per cent in 1984, 20 per cent in 1991 and an estimated 30 per cent in
1992.
'This shows how the scientific community is expressing its frustration with
the funding mechanisms and the lack of resources here,' she said.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour row on votes for shadow team
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SPATE of claims and counter-claims about past practices in shadow cabinet
elections broke out in the Labour party yesterday as a move developed to
change the voting arrangements for next month's shadow cabinet elections.
Mr Ron Davies, MP for Caerphilly, said that there was a very clear
suggestion that on some occasions the ballot box had been opened and votes
counted before the close of the poll.
'Now if that happens and you have knowledge of the placing of candidates and
you also have in your possession a number of ballot papers, then obviously
you are well placed to affect in a very clear and a very direct way the
outcome of the election,' he said on BBC Radio.
Mr Bryan Gould, a shadow cabinet member and contender for the Labour
leadership, said yesterday that there were sufficient grounds for an inquiry
into the claims.
He said that he had never taken part in deals or been involved in such
activity, but that anyone who had been involved in shadow cabinet elections
in recent years, would know 'that blank ballot papers are in the possession
of some campaign managers'.
Mr Ray Powell, a senior Labour whip, said that on previous occasions some
MPs had given him blank ballot papers so that he could exercise proxy votes
on their behalf, but that these had to be used to support their chosen
candidates.
He vigorously denied that there was any need for an inquiry, and added: 'For
anybody to suggest or imply that any member of parliament would give licence
to any other MP to use his discretion as to how he should vote or she should
vote is absolutely ridiculous.'
Mr Jeff Rooker, MP for Perry Bar, has written to shadow cabinet members
urging that forthcoming party elections are scrutinised by an outside body.
The matter is likely to be raised at a meeting of the parliamentary party
next week or the week after.
But the official party line was that when substantial allegations were made,
they would be examined by the shadow cabinet and officers of the
parliamentary party.
While some in the official camp were accusing their colleagues of raising
the issue in order to gain publicity for their own shadow cabinet election
chances, there is also some concern among MPs that senior frontbenchers who
are supporting Mr Gould in the leadership contest should not find themselves
unfairly penalised.
The shadow cabinet elections overlap with the leadership elections:
nominations close on 16 July - just two days before the leadership vote -
but the ballot does not close until 23 July.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Unit costs variations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR'S survey indicated wide variations in the unit costs of providing
Youth Training and Employment Training across England and Wales.
The figures appeared to show that in Suffolk, for example, a YT place cost
Pounds 65.15 a week, while in South Glamorgan it cost Pounds 34.19.
Tecs pointed to technical reasons for the variations, as well as differences
in local requirements. Mr Mike Bax, chief executive of Suffolk Tec, said his
was one of 11 areas involved in the government's pilot training credits
scheme, and extra money allocated for the pilot had been incorporated within
unit costs.
Department of Employment officials also suggested that some Tecs may have
excluded 25 per cent bonuses related to qualifications achieved by trainees.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Power sell-off 'a success'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE privatisation of National Power and PowerGen, the electricity
generators, was yesterday declared a success by the National Audit office,
the public-spending watchdog.
Sir John Bourn, head of the office, told parliament that in spite of having
to float the two companies during a period of market uncertainty due to the
Gulf crisis, the Department of Energy had 'introduced a number of
innovations'.
The two companies, created out of the former Central Electricity Generating
Board, were floated in March last year. The report said the department had
largely achieved its aims of maximising net proceeds, increasing individual
share ownership and achieving a modest share premium.
The office praised the department's handling of the offer, particularly the
practice of obtaining indications of likely demand from institutions at
various prices. Taxpayers had also shared in the benefits of an upward
movement in the market during the offer period, thanks to a back-end tender,
where a proportion of shares were earmarked for offer to the highest bidders
among overseas and institutional investors after the offer period. This
raised an additional Pounds 44.5m.
However, it said incentives offered to individuals may have represented
'less value for money' than in the earlier sale of the regional electricity
companies. The incentives, estimated to have cost Pounds 40.9m, were of the
same level as those in the previous sale, but had played a more limited
role.

<TEXT>
SIR MICHAEL CHECKLAND, director-general of the BBC, and Sir Peter Gregson,
permanent secretary at the Department of Trade and Industry, will be among
witnesses called by the all-party public accounts committee in the weeks
leading up to parliament's summer recess.
The reconvened public-spending watchdog, which will again operate under the
chairmanship of Mr Robert Sheldon, Labour MP for Ashton-under-Lyne and a
former Treasury minister, recommences hearings next Monday.
New members of the committee include Mr Denzil Davies, a former Labour
defence spokesman.
It is thought that an early task for Mr Sheldon will be to question
officials to determine whether any parts of a National Audit Office report
into the so-called Yamamah arms contract between the UK and Saudi Arabia can
be made public.
Sir Michael will be called to answer questions about the BBC World Service,
which was urged to improve its efficiency by a recent report from the
National Audit Office. Sir Peter will be asked about the privatisation of
the regional electricity boards.
The committee begins its hearings against a background of discontent among
many MPs about delays in the reactivation of the select committee system.
Mr Jack Cunningham, shadow Commons leader, yesterday insisted there should
be a select committee to cover 'each department of state', and in particular
a committee to scrutinise Scottish affairs.
If the government would meet these demands, there was 'no reason why they
cannot be established very very quickly,' he said.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Blair claims survey shows cuts in
training provision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DIANE SUMMERS, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO 60,000 school-leavers could find themselves without Youth Training
scheme places in the coming months in spite of government guarantees that
all young people would be provided for, the Labour party claimed yesterday .
A survey of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils carried out by Labour
showed that, in real terms, the YT budget was being cut by Pounds 50m or 7
per cent in the current year, said Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment
secretary.
In addition, the budget for Employment Training for adults was being cut by
Pounds 65m, or over 15 per cent, even though unemployment was continuing to
rise, he said.
Mr Blair challenged the government to 'confirm or deny' the figures and to
explain why ministers 'have consistently denied that cuts are taking place
and that waiting lists exist, when the evidence that we have uncovered
proves precisely the opposite'.
Mr Patrick McLoughlin, employment minister, said the guarantee of YT
provision was being met 'broadly speaking' and that funding this year was
also 'broadly in line' with last year's allocations, in spite of more young
people staying on at school.
The government would discuss with individual Tecs any problems about funding
or meeting the guarantee, said Mr McLoughlin. He added that some waiting
lists were largely administrative because some courses started only at
particular times of the year.
Sixty out of the 82 Tecs replied to Labour's survey. London Tecs are still
negotiating over funding.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Classicists rue decline of role in industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLD rivalries between arts and science students resurfaced at the Oxford
Union last night as captains of industry debated their relative merits.
The motion before the house was that the British economy was better served
by science graduates than arts graduates.
Sir Anthony Cleaver, chairman of IBM UK and a former Oxford classicist, told
the chamber that arts graduates were vital to British industry.
Ms Judith Hann, a presenter of the BBC's Tomorrow's World, complained that
her employer was run by woolly-minded arts graduates incapable of analytical
thought. Her husband, an arts graduate in a senior BBC post , was sitting on
the opposition benches.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, TSB chairman and another classicist, remarked with
some regret that he and Sir Anthony were probably the last generation in
which classicists would lead so much of British industry.
Figures from the Oxford careers service indicate that the days of Oxbridge
graduates of any discipline leading British industry may be numbered. Last
year, the proportion of Oxford graduates going into manufacturing was the
lowest since the second world war, at less than 5 per cent.
Graduates themselves seem to have decided that degree discipline is
irrelevant and the subsequent professional training is what matters:
accountancy and law are now the favourite careers.

FT  12 JUN 92 / CBI reports 'slow, gradual recovery'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR SOME months, econo-mists have been wondering what sort of recovery
Britain can expect so long as the housing market remains depressed.
Yesterday's distributive trade survey from the Confederation of British
Industry provides part of the answer: retail and wholesale turnover is
rising but at a slow rate and at an uneven pace among sectors.
The CBI's survey of 242 companies in the retail trade and 142 wholesalers,
carried out between May 19 and June 3, shows that the Tory election victory
has failed to trigger a consumer boom. The short post-election boost to
high-street sales has been replaced by a 'slow, gradual recovery' according
to Mr Nigel Whittaker, chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel.
In the motor trade, where the CBI polled 76 companies, there is no sign that
the Budget incentives for car buyers or the election result have had any
significant effect on demand. Motor traders reported that sales in May were
down marginally on a year ago and were very poor for the time of the year.
The poor state of the housing market was reflected last month in a sharp
fall in sales of furniture, carpets and durable household goods compared
with May last year. The survey found that none of the retailers selling
household textiles, furniture and carpets thought business was 'good for the
time of the year' last month. Some 10 per cent thought trade was 'average'
while 90 per cent thought it was 'poor'.
By contrast, several retail sectors benefited from good weather in May.
Sales of clothing and footwear moved ahead after two months of decline.
There was a sharp improvement in confidence among footwear retailers: 59 per
cent said trade was 'good for the time of year' against 30 per cent who said
it was poor. This resulted in a positive balance of 29 per cent of footwear
retailers happy with May's trading against negative balances of 89 per cent
and 73 per cent in March and April respectively.
Chemists' shops fared better than most other retailers. Sixty-six per cent
reported higher sales volumes last month than a year before, while a
positive balance of 46 per cent thought trade was good. Grocers also
reported higher sales than a year ago, but the rate of increase had slowed
since April.
Retailers and wholesalers expect increased sales this month, although
retailers say that sales are heavily dependent on promotional activity.
The survey contains some rather more upbeat news about the future. Every
quarter the CBI asks its panel whether they expect the overall business
situation to improve, remain stable or deteriorate in the next three months.
Among retailers, the latest survey shows the sharpest improvement in
confidence since August 1988, with 36 per cent expecting an improvement in
trade against 6 per cent predicting a deterioration.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Truck and van sales down 7.7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES OF commercial veh-icles in the UK fell 7.7 per cent last month
compared with May last year.
Demand for new commercial vehicles has fallen for 32 months in succession,
and sales last month were 50.5 per cent lower than in May 1989.
Sales of new commercial vehicles fell last month to 16,024 from 17,358 a
year ago and 32,393 in May 1989, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders said.
In the first five months of this year, registrations of new commercial
vehicles were 86,331, 10.8 per cent lower than a year before.
Last month sales of medium vans, the sector led by the Ford Transit, rose
3.5 per cent year-on-year, but this was overshadowed by a further fall of
13.7 per cent in light-van sales, and a further drop of 14.4 per cent in
truck sales (above 3.5 tonnes gross vehicle weight).
Truck sales in the first five months of the year at 12,520 were 60.8 per
cent lower than in the corresponding period of 1989.
However, some commercial vehicle makers have increased their sales in spite
of the recession. In the small-van sector Vauxhall has seen a year-on-year
increase of 5.9 per cent in sales, boosting its share of the sector market
to 33.8 per cent from 27.9 per cent in May last year.
In the medium-van sector Leyland DAF and Volkswagen have increased their
sales by 12.3 per cent and 14.1 per cent respectively in spite of a drop of
9.7 per cent in the sector.
Renault's fortunes have deteriorated sharply with its UK sales of trucks
over 3.5 tonnes plunging by 40.7 per cent in the first five months. However,
Volvo truck sales have risen.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Car chiefs seek more DTI help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS and KEVIN DONE, MOTOR INDUSTRY CORRESPONDENT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CAR industry leaders, increas-ingly concerned at the absence of any clear
revival in the UK's long-depressed market for new cars, are to seek further
government support next Tuesday at their first meeting with Mr Michael
Heseltine, trade and industry secretary.
They are also expected to air their irritation over confusion created by
conflicting UK and EC reports on price differentials on new cars within
Europe.
They will also use the meeting to oppose proposals in the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission report on car prices that the government should promote
competition by lifting the 'voluntary restraints' that have restricted
Japanese-built cars to 11 per cent of the UK market since the mid 1970s.
The industry group will comprise the chief executives of Ford, Vauxhall,
Rover and Peugeot, and Mr Colin Hope, president of the Society of Motor
Manufacturers and Traders.
They will meet Mr Heseltine against the background of statistics showing
that a 9.1 per cent sales upturn in April was not sustained. Last month's
sales were up only 1.4 per cent on a year-on-year basis, leaving the
year-to-date total 5.3 per cent lower than the equivalent, severely
depressed 1991 period.
The gloom was underlined by statistics released yesterday which show that
output fell last month by 6 per cent - the second successive monthly fall -
under the impact of a steep decline in output for export markets.
Mr Ian McAllister, Ford of Britain chairman, said that the expected
post-election sales upturn 'patently has not materialised'. He warned that
unless there was a marked recovery in August - the month of the new
registration prefix which normally accounts for more than 20 per cent of
annual sales - this year's market could be as small as 1.5m, some 35 per
cent below the 1989 record of 2.3m.
The industry delegation is likely to press Mr Heseltine to complete the
abolition of special car tax - it was cut to 5 per cent from 10 per cent in
the Budget - and take a more sympathetic view of company cars in his
taxation review.
Statistics from the society and the Central Office of Information showed car
output dropping last month to 105,332 from 111,996 in May last year.
Production for the domestic market rose by 16 per cent to 65,432, but this
was overshadowed by a 28.3 per cent fall in output for export.
Car production in the first five months, at 557,552, was 2.1 per cent lower
than a year before.
Commercial-vehicle output is maintaining the pace of recovery established in
the past six months, however, helped by new ranges of small vans from Ford
and Vauxhall.
Commercial-vehicle production last month increased year-on-year by 30.3 per
cent to 22,101. It was boosted by higher output for the domestic and export
markets. Output of commercial vehicles in the first five months, at 111,486,
was 19.8 per cent higher than in the corresponding period a year before. In
spite of this improvement output was still nearly 26 per cent below the
level of the first five months of 1989.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Warning on Glaxo drug for migraine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IMIGRAN, the Glaxo migraine treatment thought to have potential sales of
Dollars 1bn a year, is possibly dangerous in patients with certain heart
conditions, according to the Committee on Safety of Medicines.
The committee, which advises the Department of Health, warned doctors that
it had received 34 reports of patients who suffered pain or chest tightness
after being injected with the drug. Glaxo's shares fell 27p in a weak market
to close at 711p.
In the latest issue of Current Problems, its occasional newsletter, the
committee said studies had shown that Imigran might cause constriction of
the coronary arteries. It called on all doctors to report adverse reactions
to the drug.
The warning comes after a letter last month in the British Medical Journal
described heart problems in two patients after being given Imigran. An
average of 15,000 prescriptions a month had been recorded since the
medicine's launch in September. The company started marketing an oral
version in the UK this month.
Glaxo said yesterday that clinical trials had demonstrated that the drug
could have adverse side effects in a small minority of patients. The number
of adverse reactions reported by British doctors was not greater than
expected. The company said it had received similar reports from other
countries, although these had not been in large numbers.
Imigran constricts the brain's blood vessels, but there are fears it may act
systemically throughout the body and could affect the heart.
Imigran's sales during the last half year were only Pounds 13m, but it is
described as one of Glaxo's three potential 'blockbusters' - defined as
capable of generating Dollars 1bn (Pounds 545m) of sales a year.
One US analyst has estimated that Imigran's sales could reach Dollars 10bn a
year by the end of the decade. Others have scaled back their predictions,
but view it as important for the company's future.
Imigran is available in 18 countries but its high price has caused
controversy. France refused to licence it because of its high price and
safety fears.
Glaxo claims there is no alternative effective treatment for migraine.
British pharmaceuticals exports increased by 29 per cent during the first
three months of the year to Pounds 698m, the Association of the British
Pharmaceutical Industry said yesterday.

FT  12 JUN 92 / NHS to rule on 'gagging'
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GUIDELINES are to be drawn up by the Department of Health over 'whistle
blowing' by NHS staff worried about possible malpractice or poor patient
care.
The guidance, expected to be issued later this year, will make clear how NHS
employees can speak out about their worries.
Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, is expected to give details of the
move in a speech to NHS managers today.
NHS staff have claimed their contracts prevent them from going public about
poor conditions. Two months ago, Mrs Bottomley refused nurses' demands to
outlaw 'gagging clauses' which are being introduced in NHS trust contracts.
She told the Royal College of Nursing annual congress that staff had a duty
of confidentiality. Nurses should not go running to the press. Any concern
about possible malpractice should be reported to their managers first, she
said.
It is understood Mrs Bottomley has accepted there is a 'serious problem' and
that guidance is needed on the issue.
Mr Duncan Nichol, NHS chief executive, yesterday told health chiefs to
abandon 'macho' bully-boy sackings and to seek alternatives to dismissals.
His order follows a spate of firings of middle-ranking managers which, he
said, created a climate of 'fear and despair' in the health service.
Mr Nichol told the Institute of Health Service Managers at its conference in
Bournemouth: 'In my book, there is no place for the 'clear the desk
tomorrow' syndrome.' Staff must be treated 'fairly and with dignity'.
NHS reforms placed new emphasis on performance appraisal and increased
pressure on managers to meet targets, he said. This was no excuse for
sacking low performers when more suitable posts could be found for them.
Mr Nichol said the problem had become 'more widespread' in the last 12
months. It was not confined to any one region but was seen right across the
health service.
A hotline set up by the institute for staff anxious about their future was
now receiving four times as many calls as a few months ago.

FT  12 JUN 92 / First round of MPs' campaign seen as a success
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPS YESTERDAY welcomed the first signs of major contributions to help the
Maxwell pensioners. While the moves may relieve some of the immediate
pressure, the government will face a renewed debate on its own
responsibility when the self-critical report by the Investment Management
Regulatory Organisation on the affair is published.
That report is expected shortly - almost certainly before the next meeting
of the 100-strong all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the
Maxwell pensioners, which is likely to re-assemble in about a month. The
report will reinforce the pressure on the government to contribute to
longer-term help for the pensioners.
Mr Richard Page, the group's Tory co-chairman, said he hoped the moves had
'set the trend we hope others will quickly follow'. Mr Tony Newton, leader
of the House, hailed the reports of the possible contribution as a
'substantial vindication of the effective package' of measures to help the
pensioners announced by Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, on
Monday.
The first round of the campaign at Westminster on behalf of the pensioners
has been a victory for backbenchers that has left the front benches looking
slightly flat-footed.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, did increase the
pressure on the government that began with Monday's lobby of parliament by
Maxwell pensioners, by arranging a debate for Tuesday. However, he became a
victim of his own success, as Mr Lilley's statement did enough of what the
campaign had been seeking to keep the government and its backbenchers on the
same side. The adoption of the measures - as urged by the all-party group -
seemed more a tribute to the campaign, which held its first meeting less
than two months ago, than to Mr Lilley.
Even MPs who were publicly grateful said privately that Mr Lilley could have
engineered a larger headline figure for the temporary grants. But above all
they said that the announcement should have come noticeably before Monday's
lobby as it was inevitably seen as a response.
With the government's need to ensure the credibility of occupational pension
schemes; and a strong report from the cross-party social security committee
in the last parliament, the campaign started with good prospects.
The Labour co-chairman of the group was Mr Frank Field who led the social
security committee in the previous parliament and is widely respected for
his knowledge of this area. Mr Page has kept a lower profile, but has shown
considerable skill as a Westminster fixer.
He contributed to the campaign's success by realistically pitching the first
demands at a 'drip feed' of money for the pension schemes and other measures
that ministers could bring themselves to accept at a time when writing a
taxpayers' cheque for much of the bill was still unthinkable for the
government.
The campaigning MPs will have to decide whether the unthinkable should
become their aim.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Failed bid for leading role in Hollywood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT Maxwell apparently dreamed of becoming a Hollywood mogul and in 1990
made an unsuccessful Dollars 500m bid for Orion Pictures, the now-bankrupt
studio best known for releasing Woody Allen's films.
According to a former investment bank adviser to Maxwell, the late media
tycoon asked Wertheim Schroder, the New York investment bank partly owned by
Schroder of the UK, to forward the bid to Mr John Kluge, chairman of
Metromedia, the company that owned 70 per cent of Orion. Wertheim Schroder
has confirmed that it acted as Maxwell's emissary to explore prospects of a
bid of about Dollars 500m for Orion.
A spokesperson for Mr Kluge confirmed Maxwell's interest in Orion, but
called the discussions 'preliminary' and said they did not result in a firm
offer.
Last December, a year after the Maxwell bid, Orion filed for protection from
creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.
Entertainment industry analysts say that had Maxwell succeeded in capturing
Orion, the Hollywood company would probably have been forced into bankruptcy
anyway, or would now be in the hands of the court-appointed UK
administrators of the Maxwell empire.
Wertheim Schroder, which handled the Orion matter on a contingency basis,
was not paid any fees by Maxwell. The investment bank did receive a payment
for its 1990 advice on the sale of Maxwell printing companies to Quebecor,
the Canadian printing and publishing group.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Price-fixing deals on milk ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES, Consumer Industries Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEVEN leading dairy companies have given assurances to the Office of Fair
Trading that they will not engage in restrictive practices to fix the price
of doorstep milk or collude in tendering for milk supplies.
This is believed to be the first time the OFT has sought voluntary
undertakings from companies instead of referring them to the Restrictive
Practices Court. The OFT said it wanted to avoid court proceedings because
of the large costs involved.
OFT inquiries begun in the early 1980s uncovered more than 150 illegal
price-fixing agreements. The OFT said all the agreements had been terminated
at least three years ago.
The companies giving undertakings are Clifford Foods, Co-operative Wholesale
Society, Co-operative Retail Services, Dale Farm Dairy Group, Healds
Dairies, Unigate Dairies and William Stevenson.
Similar undertakings are being negotiated with Associated Dairies and the
National Dairymen's Association, a trade group.
The OFT said the undertakings did not imply admission of wrongdoing because
many agreements were made by subsidiaries before acquisition.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Failed company's pension fund cash used to back loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT Pounds 2m belonging to the pension fund of Burlington International,
the footwear manufacturer which went into receivership in March with debts
estimated at Pounds 10m, was used as collateral for a loan to the company
from a branch of Barclays Bank some months before it failed.
Law Debenture Corporation, appointed as independent trustee for the pension
fund, is looking into transactions of more than Pounds 11m between the
company and its pension fund which began in December 1989.
The collateral enabled Burlington to obtain an increased overdraft at
Barclays Bank and was intended to generate a fee for the pension scheme. The
former trustees for the pension scheme agreed to the transaction, according
to Law Debenture Corporation.
However, Law Debenture Corporation believes the market value of the
Burlington buildings and land purchased by the pension scheme in December
1989 is now about half of the Pounds 6.2m paid.
Also, the value of Burlington machinery, purchased by the pension scheme for
Pounds 1.5m, may now be only Pounds 300,000, Law Debenture Corporation said.
The pension scheme also loaned a further Pounds 1.5m to the company last
year which has not been repaid.
Law Debenture said it believed the pension scheme, which had assets of
Pounds 35m when it was last valued, may still have enough funds to meet its
obligations.
Separately, it emerged yesterday that cooker manufacturer Belling, which is
now in receivership, sold one of its subsidiaries to its pension scheme for
Pounds 5.5m just six months ago. Law Debenture Corporation, which is also an
independent trustee to the Belling scheme, said the investment accounted for
more than a quarter of the scheme's Pounds 25m assets.
However, Law Debenture believes that there will be sufficient assets to meet
all the liabilities because the scheme's accounts for last year showed a
surplus.
Law Debenture said it believes the subsidiary may now be worth 'somewhat
less' than was paid for it because its single biggest customer was Belling
itself, which accounted for between 10 per cent and 15 per cent of its total
sales.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Anger at suggestion of 'moral obligation'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, ANDREW JACK and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS and professional advisers to the Maxwell empire yesterday reacted with
indignation to the suggestion that they have a moral obligation to help
pensioners.
However the National Association of Pension Funds, the industry trade
association, said yesterday that it will be the first to contribute to the
government's voluntary trust fund to aid the Maxwell pensioners with a
donation of Pounds 120,000 - a fraction of the hundreds of millions of
pounds that the pension funds will require.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, announced on Monday the setting
up of the voluntary trust into which financial institutions that had
'profited handsomely' from dealings with Maxwell companies 'might feel some
moral obligation' to contribute.
Ministers have been privately suggesting for months that both the pensions
industry and the City financial institutions which had dealings with the
late Robert Maxwell might help replace the pensioners' stolen funds.
But the Financial Times yesterday contacted many of the institutions that
did business with the Maxwell empire and found only one which said it would
contribute to a voluntary fund - National Westminster Bank, which holds
shares claimed by the pension funds.
The chief executive of one large City bank said: 'It is out of the question
that City institutions should dig in their pockets to help the pensioners.
It is not our responsibility. The government has already damaged the
reputation of the City internationally by suggesting there should be a
begging bowl to help the pensioners.' He said that it was unlikely that any
voluntary scheme to raise money from the City would work.
Some City institutions regard the plight of the Maxwell pensioners as a
problem which should be solved by the pensions industry. However the
association has made clear that its members will not pick up the tab for the
whole of the deficit.
Mr Paddy Linekar, chief executive of M&amp;G Group, the fund managers, and
chairman of the Institutional Fund Managers Association, said the
association's view was that, while there was great sympathy for the
pensioners' plight, it was up to individual members to decide whether to
contribute. 'But speaking from M&amp;G's point of view, we wouldn't touch
Maxwell with a barge-pole, and it seems a bit rich to ask us to cough up
money.'
Professional advisers to the Maxwell company pension schemes reacted with
equal outrage at the suggestion that they aid pensioners. One adviser to the
Maxwell pension schemes said: 'What about asking the people who clean the
toilets at the Maxwell companies to contribute? After all, they benefited
too. We were no different than they are.'

FT  12 JUN 92 / NatWest had doubts on shares: Bank asked Kevin Maxwell for
pledges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank accepted shares offered to it by Mr Kevin Maxwell
even though it had doubts about whether they were properly his to give, it
emerged yesterday.
Maxwell pensioners, whose shares and funds were looted by Robert Maxwell,
will be concerned that the UK bank did not act on these doubts by refusing
the shares.
The shares in question are a Pounds 20m holding in Teva, an Israeli
pharmaceutical company. The Maxwell pension funds claim the shares belong to
them.
NatWest received the shares as security for a Dollars 27.3m loan that it
made to Robert Maxwell Group, a Maxwell private company, two days after
Robert Maxwell's death. The bank noticed that the name of Bishopsgate
Investment Management, the trustee for the pension funds, was on the
document transferring ownership of the shares.
So it pointed out to Mr Kevin Maxwell that BIM appeared to be the owner of
the shares. Mr Maxwell insisted that BIM was holding the shares in trust for
RMG.
Nonetheless, NatWest appears not to have been satisfied by his explanation.
Because of its uncertainty about the ownership of the Teva shares, NatWest
insisted that both BIM and RMG should produce mortgage documents pledging
the shares to NatWest.
Mr Kevin Maxwell signed both for BIM and for RMG. Both documents also
contain the signature of one other director of BIM and RMG respectively.
NatWest has said that it took the mortgage of the shares in 'good faith'. It
has pointed out that the shares are now being claimed both by the
administrator of RMG and by the pension funds.
It has therefore applied to the High Court to give directions as to the
ownership of the Teva shares.
NatWest said that if the court ruled that the shares were pension fund
assets - and were not properly at the disposal of RMG - it would return the
shares to the pension funds.
The pension funds claim that Pounds 217m of their resources are held by
banks which lent money to the Maxwell private companies.

SIR DONALD NICHOLLS, the vice-chancellor, will rule in the High Court today
on whether the Pounds 930m settlement negotiated by liquidators of the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International can go ahead.
Touche Ross, the liquidator, is asking Sir Donald to give the go-ahead for
the deal to be offered to creditors. The deal, which is estimated to give
creditors a return of 30 per cent to 40 per cent, involves the injection of
about Pounds 930m by the Abu Dhabi authorities - the bank's majority
shareholders.
Abu Dhabi yesterday said it had lowered the level of acceptances necessary
for the scheme to go ahead from Dollars 7bn of creditors to Dollars 4.75bn.
The creditors are likely to seek international government help to make good
their losses if the judgment today goes against them.
The package also needs approval from courts in Luxembourg and the Cayman
Islands at hearings later this month.

INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer,
has extended to continental Europe its battle against companies that it
claims are counterfeiting vital components of its large computer systems.
Yesterday it started proceedings against Phoenix International (Computers),
UK-based subsidiary of Phoenix Computer Associates of the US. It alleges
that Phoenix, a computer brokerage based in Surrey, sold memory cards -
printed circuit boards bearing memory chips - as genuine IBM products, when
they had, in fact, been reworked by a third party.
The action follows similar moves in the US against Phoenix's parent and four
other US companies. They are Comdisco, one of the world's largest computer
leasing companies, and three engineering and broking companies  - Datanon,
Allen-Myland and BSM Corporation.
Neither the managing director nor the finance director of Phoenix was
available for comment yesterday.
The issue of 'altered memory' is contentious in the computer industry
because of the large market for used IBM mainframe computers.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US yesterday stepped up its diplomatic offensive in Rio de Janeiro,
ahead of President George Bush's arrival at the summit, which reaches its
climax today.
While Mr Bush repeated in Washington that he would not sign one of the
summit's central treaties, on biological diversity, US summit delegates
sought to improve their image in Rio, where the US has been largely
isolated.
There remain critical problems to be resolved at the summit before more than
100 heads of government arrive. Germany and Brazil were last night
co-ordinating negotiations in an attempt to bridge differences on finance
and forests. Delegates were hopeful of an agreement on finance, but a pact
on a set of non-binding forest principles was in disarray as the first heads
of government, including Mr John Major, UK prime minister, arrived.
Forests have proved the most contentious issue of the summit and 17 hours of
negotiations appeared only to have widened north-south differences. Mr Kamal
Nath, forestry minister of India - the most obstructive country on agreeing
the declaration - described the position as 'a stalemate'.
After German and US-led ministerial meetings throughout the day, there was
new optimism that agreement might be reached on most points of the forest
principles, with the enticement of increased aid apparently being offered
and a softening of the position of Malaysia, which had taken a hard line.
Mr Celso Lafer, Brazil's foreign minister, said: 'The expectation is that we
can wrap everything up by the end of the day so that we have time for
documents to be processed, translated and distributed by Sunday.'
US administration officials, meanwhile, kept up attacks on the environmental
records of other countries which they say have unfairly criticised the US.
They singled out the high number of threatened German fish, mammal and bird
species, as well as the level of imports of tropical woods into Japan and
the European Community.
Mr William Reilly, administrator of the US Environment Protection Agency,
announced measures to strengthen the conference's treaties. The US wanted a
'prompt start' on the climate change convention to limit greenhouse gases.
This included quick ratification, stricter monitoring of power station
emissions, and a detailed national action plan to reduce greenhouse gases.
Mr Bush vowed as he left for Rio yesterday he would stand firm in his
refusal to sign the summit convention on biological diversity.
With the UK having agreed to sign the convention, aimed at protecting global
species, the US is likely to be the only big country holding out against it.
But Mr Bush said the convention contained provisions that had nothing to do
with bio-diversity and which could hinder US economic growth.

FT  12 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Critics doubt Japanese motives - Tokyo's
readiness to help clean up the Third World, says David Lascelles, is partly
self-interest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RUMOUR raced through the hall of delegates at the summit this week: Japan
had pledged Dollars 100bn (Pounds 55bn) in environmental aid to the Third
World.
It was quickly denied by the Japanese office in Rio. But the fact that
people were prepared to believe in such a staggering sum was no surprise,
for Japan has taken a high profile there, and everyone expects it to back
this with an offer of hard cash.
Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, who is in Rio, says Japan
intends to act as 'a bridge' between countries to help make a success of the
conference.
Tokyo's message has caused a stir because Japan seldom seeks a lead role in
global matters. Yet here is clearly an issue for which it is eminently
suited. It has made an impressive job of cleaning up its own industrial
mess, and it now has the money and technology to transfer that experience to
poorer countries.
Even so, summit participants are treating Japan's initiatives with caution
because its motives are not clear. It is easy to find reasons why Japan sees
its interests threatened by growing concern about the environment. As the
world's largest importer of resources, it is vulnerable to measures taken by
other countries to protect their natural wealth.
Also, though Japan has instituted tough internal controls to clean up its
own land, air and water, it has yet to back its professed concern for the
environment with measures to curb its appetite for imported raw materials.
Tropical timber and whales are the issues that stir most controversy.
Organisations such as Greenpeace and Friends of the Earth operate in Japan,
but on a tiny scale by western standards, and their campaigns have drawn
little public response. Japan's clean-up has come through administrative
measures rather than pressure which adds to foreign suspicions that the real
driving force behind Japan's environmental diplomacy is its national, and
particularly its big business, interests.
Not that there is a shortage of high-minded motives. Dr Shuzo Nishioka,
director of the Centre for Global Environmental Research in Tsukuba, north
of Tokyo, says: 'People here get nervous when they hear others say that
Japan has succeeded economically, but that it is not contributing to the
world. Countries which get to the peak of their era give the world
something: France gave notions of freedom, the US gave the mass-production
system. The global environment is a good issue for us to tackle.'
The real question is whether Japan is willing to make a sacrifice, in
particular to reduce the ravages its industry makes on the raw materials of
other countries. As Mr Yu Tanaka of Kiki, an environmental group, points
out, Japan's imports weigh seven times as much as its exports. The
difference is either consumed domestically or goes to waste.
Like many critics, he maintains that Japan has cleaned up its industries
only by relocating the worst of them abroad. This accusation is not always
convincing. Last year, however, a bill that would have extended domestic
environmental regulations to the overseas plants of Japanese companies was
dropped by parliament, under pressure from industry. Instead, Keidanren,
industry's powerful trade group, has tried to head off environmental
regulation by taking a leading role in setting standards itself.
In 1989, Japan took its first big step towards tackling the environmental
problems of other countries by allocating a specific sum for them in its
Official Development Assistance (ODA) programme. This was Y300bn (Pounds
1.29bn) over three years. In fact, the money was spent in only two years,
and Japan is expected to announce the next stage of the programme in Rio.
But even this initiative has attracted controversy. Green groups say much of
the money is being spent to sustain Japan's sources of raw materials in
other countries by, for example, building access roads, or by teaching
countries to grow even more trees for Japanese loggers to cut down. This
accusation is denied by the Japan International Co-operation Agency, which
administers much of the ODA programme.
Japan's interest in greenery is also obviously linked to promoting exports
of anti-pollution technology. However, poorer countries hope Japan will give
it away rather than sell it, posing a further test of Japan's seriousness
about the environment.
What critics are looking for in Rio is a commitment by Japan to reduce its
call on world resources. Rather than spend aid money on Malaysian forest
management, it should be trying to reduce timber imports. If it really wants
to help other countries it should raise its ODA budget from the present
level of 0.31 per cent of GNP.
On the other hand, Japan has made enough progress in cleaning up its own
environment and boosting industrial efficiency to allow it to ask other
industrial countries to match it before they criticise.

<TEXT>
President George Bush, his eyes watering, was forced to flee a crowded city
square yesterday when riot police fired tear gas to break up a protest
against his 1989 invasion of Panama, Reuter reports from Panama City.
Pandemonium broke out at Plaza Porras, forcing Mr Bush and his wife Barbara
to flee to the safety of their limousine as security men, crouched and
weapons drawn, guarded their exit.
Mr Bush had been scheduled to deliver a speech saluting Panama's return to
democracy in his first visit to the country since US troops invaded in
December 1989 and toppled strongman Manuel Noriega.
Several hundred demonstrators, kept a block away from the square by a line
of riot police, hurled rocks and bottles. Riot police responded quickly by
firing tear gas canisters but the wind blew fumes over the crowd of several
thousand.
Panicked, they surged towards the platform, apparently to escape the noxious
fumes. The gas wafted over the platform where the Bushes and Panamanian
President Guillermo Endara were seated.
US officials said Mr Bush did not suffer injury. He was later seen with
reddened, swollen eyes.
Mr Bush had stopped in Panama for a four-hour visit and later left for the
Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.

FT  12 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Flower power draws delegates
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There seems to be more under way in Rio than environmental discussions.
Demand for the single roses being sold by Mr Chen Wen Yii of China is
running at 1,200 a day. Mr Chen's service, at a few thousand cruizeros
(about Pounds 1), enables summit romantics to send a rose to someone inside
the conference centre. A label is attached on which the admirer's name and
number is written, presumably with the hope of arranging a date. Delegates
are obviously finding the need for some light relief from such matters as
discussion on atmosphere and International Development Assistance.
The late nights in the frantic race to resolve the planet's problems are
taking their toll. Wednesday's proceedings broke up at 5am, and the previous
night went on to 4am.
Some delegates are no longer bothering to return to their hotels. Red eyes
and unshaven chins are the order of the day.
Help is at hand for delegates who cannot take the pace, in the form of an
environmentally sound Amazonian drug sold on the mezzanine floor of the
conference centre. Guarana, sold in powder or capsule form, is made from a
'sustainably cultivated' Amazonian berry, and is guaranteed to revitalise
flagging delegates over the next 72 hours of meetings. Described by one
delegate as 'like injecting pure caffeine', one pill is the equivalent of
eight cups of strong coffee. Many Brazilians swear by it and Rio residents
samba their way through the week-long Carnival with its aid.
Guarana's lack of side effects has apparently also made it a hit in London
nightclubs. Its green credentials make it most suitable for surviving the
final days of the Earth Summit.
A world record for the hotel business may have been set by the Copacabana
Palace, a magnificent belle epoque pile on the Rio seafront. Last night it
provided shelter for no fewer than 16 heads of state or government, and it
announced the fact by flying their flags along the first-floor balcony.
Its guests included the leaders of China, Jordan, Czechoslovakia, Chile and
Belarus, as well as Britain's John Major, who slipped in at 1am. The hotel's
grand entrance is constantly awash with limousines and police cars with
flashing lights, though the atmosphere inside is surprisingly relaxed.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Optimism after 10 years of agony: Argentina is still pained
by its defeat in the Falklands conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN YEARS ago on Sunday, Argentina endured the worst moment in its history
as its humiliated armed forces surrendered to British troops in the Falkland
Islands.
As the islanders celebrate the event this weekend in the company of former
British prime minister Margaret Thatcher, Argentina is still agonising over
the defeat.
Despite this, for the first time in years, there is a sense of hope and
optimism in the air in Buenos Aires.
Argentina has changed since it sent its forces to recover the islands and
now is enjoying a period of unprecedented political freedom and economic
growth.
In many ways, yesterday's defeat and today's relative prosperity are closely
linked. Defeat not only broke the power of the military and restored
civilian rule, it also eroded the power of other groups such as the church,
big business and trade unions that had blocked reforms for decades.
Hyperinflation in 1989 hastened the end of the corrupt, inefficient
state-dominated economy.
When he took office in 1989, President Carlos Menem was forced to introduce
what has become one of the world's most radical and most successful free
market reforms. Today, Argentina has low inflation, rapid economic expansion
and growing international prestige. The economy is set to grow 6 per cent
this year and inflation should fall to below 20 per cent from 84 per cent in
1991.
Growth, stability and respectability, as well as overarching objectives in
their own right, are also part of the strategy to win control of the
Falklands. Recovering the Falklands remains a national aspiration that no
government can ignore. Only last week, Mr Menem repeated earlier statements
that Argentina would peacefully establish sovereignty over the islands 'by
the year 2000'.
Argentine diplomats argue that as their country becomes a respected member
of the international community by creating a stable, prosperous and
democratic system open to international trade and investment, the Falklands'
rejection of ties with Argentina - culminating in full integration - will
therefore appear increasingly unreasonable.
The architect of Mr Menem's foreign and economic policies is Mr Domingo
Cavallo. He became foreign minister in 1989, when he established Argentina's
pro-western foreign policy. In 1991 he became economy minister, creating a
convertible currency and bringing much-needed energy and coherence to Mr
Menem's flagging reforms.
Argentina not only restored diplomatic relations with London in 1990. It has
submitted to American pressure to scrap the controversial Condor II
ballistic missile project and abandoned exports of sensitive missile and
nuclear technologies. It has applied for membership of the 24-member
industrial-nation Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development and
rarely misses an opportunity to join in United Nations peace-keeping
missions.
In return, it has won crucial backing from the US and other G7 countries in
the International Monetary Fund and World Bank.
Talks with London over the Falklands have moved on from sterile bickering
over sovereignty to mundane, but more productive discussions over fishing
rights and oil exploration regimes. Meanwhile, both sides have simply agreed
to disagree over the underlying issue of sovereignty.
Mr Guido di Tella, the foreign minister, has even gone so far as accepting
the importance of recognising the islanders' rights, rather than their
interests - an important distinction which demonstrates an Argentine
willingness to compromise.
Another important strand in the intertwining economic and foreign policies
is Argentina's courtship of British trade and investment. Britain's exports
are set to double this year from about Pounds 70m in 1991, while Argentine
exports should remain stable at about Pounds 140m. Bilateral trade is still
to reach the level at which it stood in 1981: Pounds 298.1m.
Officials want to attract UK investment in Argentina's aggressive
privatisation programme. Furthermore, privatised utility companies are
expected to invest heavily in upgrading the collapsing infrastructure,
making Argentina a promising market for everything from railway equipment to
power generators.
Buenos Aires believes growing British exports and investments will help
reduce the Falklanders' suspicions of all things Argentine. They also hope
UK companies with business in Argentina could counteract the highly
effective anti-Argentine Falklands lobby in Whitehall and Westminster.
However, the potential for expanding trade is limited by the lack of British
government export insurance cover. British officials say coverage will only
be resumed once Argentina establishes a track record in honouring
international financial commitments.
That will be easier than persuading London to change its policy of defending
the Falklanders' right to self determination. And the islanders remain as
resolutely anti-Argentine as ever.
Furthermore, Argentina still faces problems that will inevitably encourage
suspicion of its opponents in the British parliament.
The economy may be booming on the back of consumer demand, but Argentina's
industry is still a long way from being internationally competitive.
In spite of 10 years of democracy, congress is weak and, like the judiciary,
dominated by an all-powerful presidency.
Mr Menem himself is permanently dogged by corruption scandals. He cares
little for institutional reform, except for pushing hard for a
constitutional amendment which would allow him to stand for re-election.
An economic reverse, such as an upsurge in inflation, could have dangerous
political side effects. Equally, a political upset, such as another scandal
or complications arising from Mr Menem's campaign to amend the constitution,
could destabilise the economy.
The Argentine belief that its commendable policies will bring it any closer
to winning the Falkland Islands in the foreseeable future may thus prove to
be a delusion.

THE US Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has charged the three leading US
makers of infant formula with a range of improper business practices,
including price fixing and the rigging of bids for government contracts in
Puerto Rico.
Two of the manufacturers - Bristol-Myers Squibb and American Home Products -
have denied the allegations, but agreed to settle.
Abbott Laboratories, the pharmaceuticals company that has the largest share
of the US infant-formula market, has refused to settle and yesterday pledged
to contest the charges 'vigorously'.
The charges stem from an FTC investigation that began two years ago.
The Illinois-based Abbott, which has about 50 per cent of the US
infant-formula market of Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 820m) in annual sales, was
charged with price fixing and bid rigging in Puerto Rico and with conspiring
with the other companies to refrain from advertising directly to consumers
in the mass media.

MEMBERS of the former Soviet bloc are present in Rio in large numbers - not
only do they have appalling environmental problems, they also see the
occasion as an opportunity to assert their new-found independence.
Many of the erstwhile Soviet republics have come: the Baltic states,
Belarus, Ukraine, the Caucasian states and the Russian federation. The
former Yugoslav republics of Slovenia and Croatia - as well as Montenegro -
are here too. All have agreed to sign all the conference documents.
Their message has been that they accept their environments are in a mess and
are acting on it. Many have made clear they are not trying to wrest money
from the rich industrial nations which might otherwise go to help developing
countries deal with global environment problems.
However, the former Soviet bloc states have secured the inclusion in
conference documents of a reference to the problems of countries 'in
transition to market economies', which may qualify them for extra access to
financial and technological help.
Mr Jacques Attali, president of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development, gave the conference a sombre warning: 'If, in the transition to
democracy and the market economy system, all these countries do is copy
imported western models they will repeat the mistakes already committed in
the west, which is in no position to give lessons to anyone where the
environment is concerned.'

FT  12 JUN 92 / House rejects US balanced budget move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US House of Represen- tatives last night rejected the proposed
constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget by the 1998 fiscal
year.
After two days of political debate, drama and intrigue, including another
last-minute pitch for the amendment by President George Bush, the House
voted by 280 votes to 153 in favour of the motion, ten votes short of the
required two-thirds majority of the 435-member chamber.
Under US procedures, a constitutional amendment may become law if passed by
two-thirds majorities of both House and Senate and ratified by
three-quarters of the legislatures of the 50 states. If it falls at the
first hurdle, in this case the House, the Senate deliberation, which was to
have been next week, becomes moot.
Mr Bush had delayed his departure for the Earth Summit in Rio yesterday
morning for last-minute lobbying for the amendment. He has never submitted a
balanced budget as president and his conversion to the cause in recent weeks
has generally been considered electorally motivated.
His two rivals for the presidency, Governor Bill Clinton and Mr Ross Perot,
both oppose the balanced budget amendment. Mr Perot called it yesterday 'an
excuse not to do anything'. Its rejection will not help the president's
faltering political standing.
Nevertheless, it was the feeling of many in a beleaguered Congress that
public disaffection would only be addressed by extreme measures designed to
attack the Dollars 400bn budget deficit and the approximately Dollars 4
trillion (million million) national debt.
The key motion was sponsored by Congressman Charles Stenholm, a conservative
Democratic from Texas and the parallel motion in the Senate by Mr Paul
Simon, the Illinois liberal Democrat.
In the event, in the final vote last night the Democratic congressmen split
115-150 against the amendment, while all but two of the 166 Republicans
voting supported it.
Mr Stenholm's proposal would have required a balanced budget by fiscal 1998,
and thereafter, unless three-fifths of both houses of congress voted in
favour of a deficit. The amendment could be waived if the US was at war.
The case for the amendment was that the country was squandering the future
of its children. Much was made of the fact that Thomas Jefferson had first
advocated a balanced budget amendment two centuries ago.
Congressman Billy Tauzin, a Louisiana Democrat, calculated that each child
born today inherited a Dollars 16,000 mortgage as his or her share of the
national debt. Congressman Joseph Kennedy, the Massachusetts Democrat,
proclaimed that 'if our generation cannot get it together, let's have an
amendment that does'.
While Mr Kennedy and Congressman Jim Moody, a Democrat from Wisconsin,
warned that national indebtedness was 'mortgaging America to foreigners'.
The mostly Democratic opposition was marshalled by Mr Leon Panetta, the
Californian chairman of the budget committee. Mr Charles Schumer from New
York said that if it was 'absurd' to have amendments abolishing crime and
Aids, which it was, then the 'new panacea' to balance the budget was equally
absurd. Congressman Mike Synar, Democrat from Oklahoma, likened it 'to
putting garlic in the window to ward off vampires'.

RISING wholesale prices in the US last month have reopened the possibility
that inflation will revive, and have helped to dampen expectations of
further cuts in interest rates.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said producer prices rose 0.4 per cent last
month, the sharpest rise in the past 18 months. The rise took the
year-on-year wholesale inflation rate from 0.9 per cent in April to 1.1 per
cent in May.
While this is still a low increase, it sounds a note of caution to those who
have been urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further in order
to help along the faltering US recovery.
Advocates of a reduction in interest rates might otherwise have drawn
encouragement from the disappointingly weak retail sales last month.
The Commerce Department said its advance estimates put May retail sales at
Dollars 158.8bn (Pounds 87.2bn), just 0.2 per cent higher than April's
figure of Dollars 158.5bn - itself revised down from an earlier and more
optimistic estimate.

FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: EC sees signs of hope in farm row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS, DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RENEWED attempts by the European Community and US to secure a breakthrough
in the stalled Uruguay Round of world trade liberalisation talks are under
way, on the basis of the so-called 'new ideas' brought into play following
last month's reform of the Community's farm subsidies regime.
Some Brussels officials detect a new willingness in Washington to settle the
farm subsidies row, in anticipation of problems the US will have in winning
an agreement on services and market access, the two other most troublesome
areas of the Uruguay Round.
Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, will take up the talks when he
comes to Brussels next week.
Nevertheless, the EC and US remain stuck in apparently close but until now
irreconcilable positions on farm subsidies.
On the central US demand that the EC cut its volume of subsidised food
exports by 24 per cent, Washington is immovable, a senior Commission
official says. Mr Frans Andriessen, the external affairs commissioner, is
understood to have offered a 20 per cent cut, with 5 per cent swings within
sectors, so that, for instance, in cereals, the EC could export more wheat
if it exported less barley.
But the most the US appears willing to accept is to extend the cuts -
applicable pro rata to all products - over seven to eight years, instead of
the six years stipulated by the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt).
The US also wants to set in concrete the 15 per cent 'set-aside' (taking
land out of production) in the EC's recent farm regime reform. This
set-aside is the condition for farmers receiving compensation payments for
big price cuts, and is one of two ways the Community intends to rein in
overproduction.
The US would allow these direct payments as non-trade distorting subsidies,
officials say, provided overall domestic subsidy was cut by 20 per cent. Mr
Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner, has demanded that payments
linked to production restraint should be totally exempt and open-ended.
Senior officials say, however, that the the US is moving towards a big
concession on the EC's demand for a so-called 'peace clause', whereby it
would desist from unilateral trade sanctions such as the punitive tariffs it
is now threatening on EC food exports. This, they say, would take the form
of an undertaking to pursue future disputes through Gatt procedures - not
the case in the current dispute sparked by the EC's oilseeds regime.
The Irish agriculture minister, Mr Joe Walsh, yesterday called the US
ambassador in Dublin to his office 'for clarification' over Washington's
threat to impose punitive tariffs on a 'hitlist' of Dollars 2bn of EC food
exports, if the EC does not reform its oilseed subsidy regime, writes Tim
Coone in Dublin.
More than 10 per cent of the penalties would fall on Irish exports, a highly
disproportionate amount given Ireland's small contribution to EC oilseed
production and given that its population is just 1 per cent of the EC.
Meanwhile, Mr Ray MacSharry, the EC agriculture commissioner (right), said
the US would suffer much more in a trade war with the EC as it had a trade
surplus with Europe. 'The US and EC should look for peace in international
trade and not trade wars,' he added. The punitive tariffs would be
particularly damaging for Ireland's dairy processing industry, and for
specialised liqueurs, using cream, which feature prominently on the
'hitlist'.

FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: US political sands shift under Nafta -
Prospects for the free trade deal are no longer so certain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST weeks ago, the prospects for the North American free trade agreement
seemed assured.
The proposed pact between the US, Canada and Mexico had the support of the
Republican establishment, of Governor Bill Clinton, the prospective
Democratic nominee, of the powerful Texas Democrats on Capitol Hill and most
of the Democratic leadership in Congress.
But the outpouring of public disaffection for 'politics as usual' has pushed
to the forefront of many polls in the US election campaign Mr Ross Perot,
the Texas billionaire. His campaign for the presidency is stressing jobs,
and he has said a Nafta pact would send jobs to Mexico.
The White House has taken its own polls and remains convinced that President
Bush's support for Nafta is a winning issue. Although many working class
Hispanic Americans believe Nafta would cost jobs, the Latino business
organisations cautiously support the pact.
Under the tightly constrained fast-track procedure - which forces Congress
to vote on a trade pact without amendment - it is too late to get Nafta
approved by Congress this year. Between retirements and election defeats,
one-quarter to a one-third of the House could change, and no one can foresee
the prevailing sentiment on trade issues.
The president is expected to stage a high profile initialing of the
agreement at the most politically opportune time.
Politically sophisticated trade lobbyists, like Mr Harry Freeman, executive
director of the MTN Coalition, believes the Democrats will use Nafta as a
weapon against the president, arguing that he wants to divert jobs to
Mexico.
A centrepiece of the opposition will be a letter from the president to the
Congress in May 1991, in which he committed himself to action on
environmental issues, labour rights and worker adjustment assistance.
'Whatever the administration sends to Capitol Hill with Nafta, or if they
don't send a complete package in these three areas, the Congressional
Democrats will seize upon the deficiency - real or alleged, it doesn't
matter,' said Mr Freeman.
Governor Clinton is also likely to deem the pact the 'wrong kind of Nafta'.
The environment/farm/ labour coalition opposed to the Nafta has prepared its
ground well in the House. It now has 200 signatories to a resolution,
introduced by Congressman Henry Waxman and majority leader Richard Gephardt,
which warns that they will not support a Nafta that does not have strong
environment or food safety provisions. Fifty-seven of the 200 signatories
voted for the president's fast-track authority and now may be moving over on
the issue.
'There are millions more people who 'get' the Nafta now,' said Ms Lori
Wallach of Ralph Nader's Public Citizen. 'They have been contacted by their
local churches, labour unions, farm groups, environmental or consumer
organisations. There is a new awareness of its costs and that has come back
to their representatives in Washington.'
In the Senate, Nafta is threatened by a resolution introduced by Senator Don
Riegle, which would permit Congress to amend the agreement in five areas.
'If the Riegle resolution gets through,' said one business lobbyist, 'we
might as well kiss Nafta goodbye.'

FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Russia to lease first western airliners in
Dollars 400m Airbus deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AIRBUS Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, is expected to deliver
the first western-built aircraft to Russia next week, after arranging lease
financing to support the sale of the five A310 wide-body airliners worth
about Dollars 400m (Pounds 220m).
The aircraft will be delivered to Russian International Airlines, a new
carrier formed to operate the five Airbus airliners on long-distance
services from Moscow to the Far East, Mr Adam Brown, Airbus director of
planning, said. The new carrier is a subsidiary of Aeroflot, the former
Soviet carrier now undergoing change following creation of the Commonwealth
of Independent States.
Airbus has agreed to assume the financial risks of the leasing arrangements
to enable the delivery of the A310s to go ahead after all the national
export credit agencies declined to support the deal. Aeroflot originally
signed a purchase agreement for the five airliners in 1990 for delivery
starting January this year. But the political situation in the former Soviet
Union made financing the sale extremely difficult.
Mr Brown said Airbus had now received 'full support' from the Russian
government, clearing the way for the consortium to arrange lease financing
'on reasonable terms'. The first A310 is expected to be delivered next
Monday and the remaining four by the end of July. Two aircraft have been
sitting at Airbus headquarters in Toulouse, south-west France, waiting for
the financing to be completed.
Aeroflot had intended to use its first western-built airliners to operate
Moscow to New York services. Airbus has also entered into a number of
co-operation agreements with the CIS aerospace industry. These include:
An agreement with the Russia Institute of Aviation Materials (VIAM) to test
light-weight lithium-bearing aluminium alloys which could eventually be used
more extensively on the new Airbus A330/340 wide-body airliner family;
A contract with the Russian-British joint venture Heavylift Volga-Dnepr to
lease large Antonov AN-124 cargo aircraft to transport equipment between the
various Airbus plants in Europe;
Use of wind-testing facilities near Moscow.
Though no serious discussions have started, Mr Brown said Airbus was
interested in co-operating on joint production of aircraft with CIS
manufacturers aimed mainly at the new aircraft requirements of the CIS. He
suggested the European Bank of Reconstruction and Development could help
finance such a venture.
However, he said there was unlikely to be any significant growth in air
traffic in the CIS before the turn of the century. 'In the short and medium
term, traffic within the region is likely to decline as the bulk of the
population devotes its limited economic resources to satisfy needs for basic
consumer commodities before turning to air travel,' he said.

<TEXT>
ISRAEL yesterday eased restrictions on citizens holding foreign exchange
accounts and investing in futures and foreign securities, the latest move in
a gradual relaxation of exchange and capital market controls designed to
generate growth and investment.
The announcement by the Bank of Israel came two days after the US ambassador
in Israel issued a strong appeal to Israeli leaders contesting the June 23
election to formulate urgent reforms of the government-dominated economy to
jolt it out of stagnation.
The Bank of Israel itself has been urging more rapid liberalisation. But the
ruling Likud party and opposition Labour leaders have offered few policy
proposals despite evidence that the economy is stalling under the burden of
mass immigration from the former Soviet Union. Unemployment last month
reached a record 11.5 per cent.
The Bank of Israel said that from July 1, individuals could for the first
time hold unlimited foreign currency accounts (although restrictions on
buying foreign currency with shekels will remain) and buy foreign securities
(although corporations will still be forbidden to). Individuals and
companies could invest in futures.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING Denmark's spanner in the Maastricht Treaty's works, there is no
doubt that the Euro-melody of the month is 'subsidiarity,' and that European
Commission and national officials are vying to see who can sing the best
descant. But not everybody gets the tune right.
Subsidiarity means the Community should keep out of decisions better taken
at a national or regional level. So magic a word is it that the incoming UK
presidency of the EC suggests spelling out what it means in a bid to help
resolve the treaty crisis.
In Strasbourg on Wednesday, Commission president Jacques Delors pinned his
colours to the subsidiarity mast, and no Commission official will discuss
cod quotas or capital adequacy without detailed exegesis of this purported
recipe for reconciling European people with European Union.
In Luxembourg on Tuesday, for instance, a somnolent meeting of EC fisheries
ministers jerked into life, when they were told they had agreed that 'in
general' member states would be responsible for ensuring their fishermen did
not cheat on quotas. 'In general'-ism is out; the Vikings are erasing weasel
words from the Euro-record.
Yesterday, transport commissioner Karel Van Miert announced new plans to
integrate Europe's transport systems, a key component of Maastricht.
His presentation was,with ostentatious genuflections to subsidiarity, part
of the now daily spectacle of Brussels pulling in its horns.
'What I do want to say is that no decision has been taken to carry out this
work,' he said.
'That is up to the national authorities. What we are supplying is the
framework.'
Or: 'If you want to go ahead with motorways, would you please take into
account this framework, which will be of benefit to the whole Community.'
It was all going well, saying please and all, until one ecologically-correct
questioner asked whether sponsoring motorways wasn't a slap in the face to
the Rio Earth Summit.
Mr Van Miert patiently explained that the poorer, 'cohesion' countries - the
southern states and Ireland - could not reasonably be denied their wish for
German-style motorways.
'It would be unfair to cohesion countries like Denmark ..' the commissioner
went on: 'Sorry, sorry,' he stuttered to tumultuous laughter; 'a slip of the
tongue.'
Quite.

<TEXT>
A SECOND round of talks between the newly elected Czech and Slovak leaders
on the future of the Czechoslovak federation ended in deadlock last night,
bringing closer the possibility of a formal split between the two republics.
After nine hours of talks, Mr Vaclav Klaus, Czech winner in the poll,
admitted no agreement had been reached with Mr Valdimir Meciar, his Slovak
counterpart. 'We haven't made any progress, not a single step forward, and
the Slovak side continues to refuse our deadline for forming a federal
government,' he said.
Mr Klaus has urged that a new federal government be formed before July 5,
when the re-election of President Vaclav Havel is due in the federal
parliament. This re-election is likely in itself to cause a Czech-Slovak
clash. Mr Meciar has refused to support Mr Havel's candidacy, while the
Czechs have said they will not accept another candidate.
But the Slovak delegation said it could not commit itself to a deadline on
forming a new federal structure. So far, it has agreed only to a temporary
federal government until a referendum on independence is held in Slovakia
towards the end of the year.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for French ratification of the Maastricht treaty strengthened
sharply yesterday when a Gaullist attempt to reject it outright was defeated
in the Senate by a comfortable margin.
All 91 Gaullist senators, as well as all 16 Communist senators, voted to
throw out the Maastricht treaty without further debate, but their motion was
defeated by 196 votes to 120. Detailed voting on the necessary revision of
the French constitution will now resume in the Senate next Tuesday.
The Senate vote is particularly encouraging for the government, because it
indicates that there is still a clear parliamentary majority in favour of
the Maastricht treaty, despite the destabilising effects of the No vote in
the recent Danish referendum.
Following last month's vote in the National Assembly, yesterday's
preliminary vote in the Senate indicates that the government can probably
count on the various majorities it requires for revising the French
constitution.
Before ratification proper, which is scheduled to take place in the autumn
in a popular referendum, the National Assembly and the Senate are both
required to revise the Constitution, first in separate votes and then in a
joint sitting of the two houses of parliament.
The joint sitting of the two houses, in a so-called Congress, requires a
three-fifths majority for final revision of the constitution. Yesterday's
Senate vote of 196 in favour of Maastricht, coupled with last month's
National Assembly vote of 398 in favour, give a combined total which is
comfortably over the required three-fifths threshold.
At the same time, the Senate vote shows that the Maastricht debate is
continuing to deepen the split between the Gaullists and their normal
allies.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Bishops say Maastricht is for life: The Catholic church's
view of Ireland's referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRELAND'S Catholic church this week fired the first barrage from its moral
artillery in the country's referendum on the European's Community's
Maastricht treaty to be held next Thursday: it brushed aside the economic
and political issues of the proposed accord on closer economic and political
union and homed straight in on abortion.
A million copies of a four-page statement by the Catholic Bishop's
Conference, entitled The Maastricht Referendum and Some of its Implications,
said: 'The substantive and fundamental issue is the right to life of the
unborn child . . . .
'We are firmly of the view that the opportunity must be given to the Irish
people to restore the constitutional guarantee of the right to life of the
child in the womb. It is our view that the only effective way of doing this
is by a new pro-life amendment (to the Irish Constitution). If the
Maastricht Treaty is approved however, there must be a degree of uncertainty
concerning the effectiveness of such an amendment,' say the bishops.
Their reasoning is that despite the 1983 right-to-life constitutional
amendment, which was designed to make watertight Ireland's ban on abortion
the recent supreme court ruling concerning a 14-year-old rape victim, which
permitted her to travel to the UK for an abortion, also established that
abortion was legally permissible in Ireland in certain circumstances. Ten
years of crusading by the Church and the anti-abortion lobby were thus
undone by that ruling and has thrust abortion to the forefront of the
Maastricht debate.
The bishops' statement says rejection of the treaty would also leave the
abortion issue unresolved and that voters are therefore faced with a
dilemma. They themselves must decide which result will give greater
guarantees of protection for the unborn.
The Yes camp immediately interpreted this as meaning that the abortion issue
was thereby effectively sidelined in the debate. The anti-abortion lobby
says the bishops' arguments justify a No vote.
In effect, the church hierarchy has opted not to position itself publicly on
the treaty but has provided the ammunition for the moral shock troops of
organisations such as the Pro-Life Campaign, the Society for the Protection
of the Unborn Child and the Youth Defence Organisation to campaign for a
'No' vote. All three are identified in the public's eye with the Catholic
Church.
Individual priests around the country have also been advising their
congregations to vote against the treaty. According to a church spokesman:
'Priests are citizens as everyone else and as such are entitled to their
opinions, but in the main will be expected to remain within the limits of
the Bishops' statement.'
Mr Bertie Ahern, the Irish finance minister, yesterday criticised his
British counterpart, Mr Norman Lamont, over the disagreement this week
between EC finance ministers on the Delors II budget package, writes Tim
Coone.
He said: 'I understand the arguments of those countries that want to see
greater transparency in the use of EC funds, and Germany's problems over the
reunification process. But I have less sympathy and understanding for
Britain's position in opposing the increases in the EC budget .. I don't
think Mr Lamont believes in the idea .. that a wealthier community and an
expansion of trade will be more readily achieved by a redistribution of
resources between member states'.
The Irish government's campaign for a Yes vote in the referendum has been
set back by the EC ministers' rejection of the Delors package, which
provides for increased funds for Ireland.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Kenneth Clarke, the British home secretary, yesterday urged his EC
counterparts not to make a crisis out of the UK's refusal to remove frontier
checks on EC citizens.
The European Commission last month levelled the threat of legal action at
Britain and any other EC member which did not abolish all controls by
January 1.
But Mr Clarke told fellow-interior ministers at a two-day meeting in Lisbon
they should not elevate the border controls issue into a 'legal battle' -
especially at a time when the Danish vote against Maastricht had raised much
larger problems for the Community.
'I don't believe you can create the European Community on the basis of
legalisms,' he said after yesterday's session on immigration.
Britain is alone in actively wanting to retain controls, arguing that they
are essential if non-EC travellers are to be properly monitored. Other
countries such as Denmark and Ireland also have difficulties because of
existing passport unions with the Nordic states and the UK.
After talking yesterday to Mr Martin Bangemann, the EC's internal market
commissioner, Mr Clarke said he thought the issue would be resolved through
political discussions during the British presidency which begins next month.
However, he did not say how a compromise might be reached, and reiterated
that Britain did not see January 1 as a firm deadline for lifting controls.
'We don't think we are under any obligation about lifting border controls,
but we are quite happy to minimise inconvenience for EC travellers,' he
said. 'We are not going to compromise our system of immigration controls.'
Only Greece, Portugal and Luxembourg seem to back the Commission's legal
approach wholeheartedly. Most other countries recognise there are practical
difficulties in applying the Brussels' hard-line interpretation of the 1986
Single European Act, which defines the internal market as 'an area without
internal frontiers'.
Portugal - which holds the EC presidency - was yesterday trying to persuade
Spain to sign a convention strengthening the Community's external frontier.
The Spanish have been blocking the convention for more than a year because
of the continuing dispute with the UK over how Gibraltar should be treated.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
HOME, James. And don't bother to come back tomorrow.
More than 1,000 uniformed drivers are looking for work in London alone,
according to Britain's leading domestic staff agencies. Demand for
chauffeurs has collapsed to a five-year low as companies and private
individuals cut spending, and there is no sign of an upturn this year.
During the mid-1980s, demand for chauffeurs outstripped supply and top
drivers could command salaries of Pounds 30,000. Since then hundreds of
drivers have been made redundant and salaries have fallen by up to 60 per
cent.
'Company chairmen say the chauffeur is always the first to go,' said Mrs May
Prosser, director of the Beauchamp Bureau. The agency has 200 unemployed
chauffeurs on its books, including the late Mr Robert Maxwell's two drivers.
It found work for only four chauffeurs last year.
Another agency, Hyde Park International, has 575 drivers looking for work
and director Ms Jenny Harrison said: 'We're not placing any at all.'
Masseys, Britain's oldest domestic staff agency, has told chauffeurs not to
register. 'We've got no jobs for them and we haven't seen any increase in
demand,' said Mr Richard Hewitt, managing director.
The All England Club is offering a brief respite to the downturn by
advertising for 216 drivers to ferry players to the Wimbledon tennis
championships later this month. More than 1,000 have applied for two-week
contracts, including two former drivers from Buckingham Palace.
Some ministerial drivers may also be looking for work following the
government's decision to explore contracting out of departmental services.
The Welsh Office yesterday confirmed it was looking at cost savings on the
two chauffeur-driven cars kept in Cardiff. But the Department of the
Environment says the 145 drivers employed by Whitehall are unlikely to be
privatised.
Mr Eric James, a London-based chauffeur, is gloomy about job competition. He
has been unemployed since the Gulf war when his Kuwaiti employers decided
they could no longer afford a personal driver for their Jaguar XJS, BMW and
Mercedes. 'Everyone is cutting back and I don't expect to get any work in
the near future,' he said. 'Chauffeurs are being driven off the road.'

FT  12 JUN 92 / Major steps back from row in Commons on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday appeared to betray its growing fears over the
strength of MPs' opposition to Maastricht by indicating that any Commons
vote on the treaty would be avoided until at least the autumn.
Amid an increasing acceptance, in private, by cabinet ministers that the
government would lose a Commons vote on Maastricht at this stage, it emerged
that Mr John Major's hint last week of a general debate before the summer
recess was unlikely to be fulfilled.
Ministers admit that next week's Irish referendum, the Lisbon European
Community summit later this month and the French plebiscite in September may
lead to a substantial change in the government's position. So far it has
urged ratification of the treaty without renegotiation but rejection by
another country could wreck that strategy.
In spite of Mr Major's talk last night of 'overwhelming support' among
Tories for his position, the government's reluctance to provoke a
confrontation will be portrayed by Tory and Labour MPs opposed to the treaty
as a retreat. It will fuel speculation that ministers will eventually admit
that the Danish referendum result requires renegotiation, if not the
dropping, of the treaty.
A bill to ratify Maastricht will not return to the Commons until October,
possibly later. However, ministers said the government's position was
consistent with Mr Major's line of awaiting events.
'The way forward in the wake of what has happened is something which cannot
be determined by one government. It depends on 12 governments,' a cabinet
minister said.
After a week of feverish speculation at Westminster - not helped by the
absence overseas of Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary  - the
unease over Maastricht at every level of the Tory party has become more
apparent. Senior Tories said Mr Major would have to exert his authority over
the party on his return. Tory Euro-sceptics, in the government and on the
backbenches, are preparing to mount strong opposition to the treaty.
Mr Bryan Gould, a challenger for Labour's leadership, said the government
was in danger of 'sitting like frightened rabbits waiting for the onrush of
events without having anything to say about what should be done'.
In the Commons, Mr Tony Newton, leader of the House, responded to barbed
questions from Tory Euro-sceptics by emphasising the importance Mr Major
attaches to subsidiarity - the principle by which decisions are taken at the
lowest appropriate level of government.
Mr John Biffen, a former cabinet minister, added to government embarrassment
by calling for the blocking of Mr Jacques Delors' reappointment as European
Commission president.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Pilkington cuts dividend and sees no pick-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PILKINGTON, the glass maker, slashed its dividend yesterday and warned that
it could not see any sign of a recovery in trading conditions. The dividend
cut was the first since Pilkington went public in 1970. Sir Antony
Pilkington, chairman, said that trading conditions 'have been the worst
anyone can remember'.
Pilkington's main customers are the building and automotive industries; both
important indicators of the economy's health.
Sir Antony said that in neither the UK nor in the US could he see 'the
mechanism to start a recovery'. His comments contributed to the fall in the
stock market. Pilkington shares fell 3p to 129p, but have fallen from 164p
in early May as the City began to anticipate a dividend cut and BTR, which
once bid for Pilkington, sold its 4.1 per cent stake.
'There is unprecedented uncertainty about the timing, nature and strength of
recovery,' Sir Antony said.
Pilkington incurred a pre-tax loss in its UK business in the year to March
31. Overall, group pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 151.6m to Pounds 77m,
after exceptional costs of Pounds 37m.
In December, Pilkington maintained its first interim dividend at 2.93p. It
hoped to hold the second payment at 7.57p. Yesterday, however, it was cut to
3.07p. That gives a total of 6p for the year; a 43 per cent reduction, even
then not covered by earnings per share of 5.5p before the exceptional costs.
This is the third year of falling profits at Pilkington. In 1988-89 pre-tax
profits were Pounds 325m. Until now the group has continued to pay the
dividend set in 1990, even though the 1990-91 earnings were not sufficient
to cover the cost.
Sir Antony said that normally the cyclical nature of the group's business
meant it would pay an uncovered dividend in difficult years, adding that
'there is a limit to the time we can pay a severely uncovered dividend'.
Chancellor Norman Lamont yesterday played down the significance of critical
remarks attributed to Sir Antony, writes David Owen. Mr Lamont said Sir
Antony, who was reported to have accused the chancellor of 'killing'
domestic industry, had assured him he wholly supported government policy.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Fears grow over UK recovery: CBI says retail sales have
failed to sustain post-election strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS grew yesterday that the UK's recovery from recession will be slow and
uninspiring after a Confederation of British Industry survey showed that
retail sales had failed to sustain their post-election strength.
The CBI's distributive trades survey for May showed that retail sales
increased compared with May last year, but the gain was modest and less than
expected. Wholesale turnover was more buoyant, but increased optimism in
this sector was offset by gloom among motor traders.
The picture of a lacklustre economy was reinforced by news of a 5.95 per
cent annual decline in UK car output last month because of a sharp fall in
export production. The reports helped depress share prices in London, where
the FT-SE 100 index closed down 22 points at 2,614.1.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, the chairman of the CBI's distributive trades panel,
said retail sales volumes had risen on a year-by-year basis in nine out of
the past 10 monthly surveys. But the recovery was slow and gradual. 'It
looks as if the improvement in trade is more moderate than that seen at the
start of the year.'
Among economists, the survey increased concern that UK economic growth this
year will fall short of the 1 per cent gain forecast by Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, in his March Budget.
Independent economists have been revising down their forecasts since last
month's first-quarter provisional gross domestic product figures showed the
UK was still in recession. They have warned that the economy could shrink
for the second year running or show growth close to zero unless consumption
revives strongly this year.
The CBI found that 45 per cent of retailers polled reported an increase in
sales last month against 31 per cent who experienced a decline. The
resulting positive balance - which indicates the trend - was 14 per cent
compared with 20 per cent in April and lower than expected by retailers.
CBI economists said the survey's results suggested that retail sales were
currently growing at an annual rate of only 1 per cent in volume terms.
While sales of clothing, footwear and chemists' goods rose in May, the
survey suggested that Britain's weak housing market was continuing to
depress demand. Sales of furniture, carpets and electrical and other
household goods fell last month compared with the previous year. MFI, the
furnishing group, reported that trading had been flat since April.
The CBI survey, however, contained some good news:
Shop prices are rising more slowly than at any time since the survey started
in 1983.
Retailers are more optimistic about future trading than at any time since
August 1988.
Distributors as a whole intend to spend more on investment over the next 12
months for the first time since August 1989, reflecting plans among
wholesalers in particular to increase capital spending significantly.
The rate of job losses in retailing slowed in May, while wholesalers
increased employment. compared with a year ago.

FT  12 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy deals in Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Midland Bank takeover saga was taken a step further yesterday when
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking was believed to have purchased two large blocks
of Midland stock.
Dealers said that the two blocks, one of 9m shares and another 7.9m, were
recorded on the Seaq ticker as having traded at 420 1/4 p and 422p.
James Capel, the leading UK agency broker owned by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai
Banking, was said to have bought the shares on behalf of the Hong Kong bank.
Hongkong Banking recently said it held a 17.74 per cent stake in Midland.
It was said in the market that the 17m shares represented the last of the
arbitrageurs, who had bought Midland stock in the hope that the takeover
battle between Hongkong Banking and Lloyds developing, selling their stock.
There were also hints that the stock had come from the Kuwait Investment
Office which sold the major part of a 10.5 per cent stake in Midland at the
end of April.
Midland shares dipped 6 to 422p, after 420p, after details of the share
purchases became known. Turnover in Midland reached 42m.
Glaxo setback
County NatWest, the securities house, appeared to be largely responsible for
a bout of hefty selling pressure on Glaxo shares which fell sharply to close
a net 27 off at 711p on exceptionally heavy turnover of 8.2m shares.
County's pharmaceuticals team published a research note suggesting that the
UK Committee on Safety of Medicines has received a number of adverse drug
reaction reports, associating the usage of Imigran, Glaxo's new migraine
drug, with chest pain.
The County analysts said that even if Imigran was to prove a commercial
disappointment, Glaxo's size and flexibility in expenditure growth rate
would limit the impact on earnings growth. 'Any marked underperformance from
this development could leave the shares at very attractive levels,' County
said.
Airways firmer
The view that the price war between international airlines on some US routes
would not hurt British Airways substantially helped the shares buck the
market trend.
The shares ended 7 up at 275p, having been higher on turnover of 7.8m, after
the company was reported to have assured City analysts in a series of phone
calls that its most lucrative route, between London and New York, was as yet
unaffected by the new transatlantic price war which started earlier this
week. The effect on routes where the price war has already started was said
to be negligible
The shares lost ground earlier in the week as US airlines announced they
were cutting the ticket prices on several routes from the US to Europe. But
Mr Christopher Will at Lehman Brothers said: 'The important thing is that
fares are not being cut between JFK and Heathrow which is the really
profitable route.'
Welsh Water shares substantially underperformed the rest of the water issues
after its preliminary figures revealed disappointing results, especially
from the company's diversification away from its core water business. By the
close Welsh Water shares were 16 lower at 451p.
Mr Robert Miller-Bakewell, water company specialist at County NatWest,
described the shares as a straight sell and warned of a below average
dividend increase for the current year.
Bank shares were unsettled by news that Standard &amp; Poor's (S &amp; P) had
downgraded its long term debt ratings for Barclays, NatWest and Royal Bank
of Scotland. S &amp; P said it had shifted its ratings because of the prolonged
recession and its impact on the banks' balance sheets.
Barclays dropped 5 to 349p, NatWest the same amount to 338p and Royal Bank
eased a shade to 197p.
Smith New Court's excellent figures - profits surged from Pounds 7.6m to
Pounds 18.4m on the back of its involvement in numerous big market deals
including Hanson's purchase of a 2.8 per cent stake in ICI - saw the shares
edge up 2 to 130p.
British Land provided some relief for a battered property sector. The shares
rose 10 to 214p after the company announced a 7.4 per cent rise in profits
to Pounds 33.3m, and a 10.4 per cent higher dividend of 6.35p.
Troubled jewellery chain Ratners gained  3/4 to 14 1/4 p, on turnover of
2.4m shares, after announcing the sale of its Watches of Switzerland
subsidiary to unlisted securities company Asprey, down 2 at 263p.
Fears that lower prices will be required to encourage consumer spending hit
some leading high street stores. The CBI's monthly survey of the
distributive trades showed sales slowed in May, while there is also concern
about the impact of a price war in the DIY sector. Kingfisher, the B&amp;Q
holding company, slipped 5 to 515p.
Devenish lost 12 to 269p, but according to analysts is still likely to
receive a bid from Boddington, unchanged at 181p, when the Northern brewer
is free to renew its offer in about a week's time, after last year's failed
takeover attempt.
Turnover in British Steel soared to 19m following two big trades in the
course of the session. A block of 7.4m was done at 70 1/2 p, while another
9m went through at 71.1p. The company's broker UBS Phillips &amp; Drew were said
to have had a big seller of stock. The shares retreated 3 to 73p.
Wednesday's meeting and dinner at Hoare Govett, which was addressed by the
new chairman of British Aerospace left investors concerned about the outlook
for the company. The main worries centre on the future of the regional
aircraft division, which could force the company to make substantial
provisions. This led to fears for the company's profits and dividend. The
shares responded by falling 13 to 319p, on turnover of 2.7m.
Mr Brian Newman at Henderson Crosthwaite said: 'The proposed merger between
Fokker and DASA will leave BAe's regional aircraft division loss-making and
isolated. This is the major strategic issue which the new management team
need to resolve.'
Oxford Instruments dropped 25 to 229p following the figures. Blick, on the
other hand, jumped 16 to 414p in the wake of the 32 per cent profits
improvement.
The Kalon bid for Manders saw the latter's shares spiral upwards to close 54
firmer at 291p and the former ease 2 1/2 to 108p.
Hints that ECC, formerly English China Clays, had indicated to a number of
analysts that their forecasts were too high, prompted a flurry of selling
which left the shares 13 weaker at 533p.

FT  12 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further losses as trading increases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAVIEST day's trading in London equities since just after the
re-election of the Conservative government early in April saw the FT-SE
Index shed a further 22 points yesterday, bringing the 2,600 mark into
closer perspective.
Disappointing reports on the domestic economy finally took second place to
worries over Wall Street following the latest data on US retail sales and
producer prices. Concern over the outlook for UK equities was also fuelled
by reports of increased political tensions at Westminster regarding the
Maastricht treaty.
Nervousness in the market was heightened as a series of very large share
deals moved across the trading screens. At least two substantial trading
programmes were reported, the first worth nearly Pounds 100m in two-way
activity, and the second about Pounds 30m, also matched between buy and sell
orders.
There was very heavy business in Midland Bank shares as many arbitrageurs
decided to bite the bullet and take losses on the large holdings built up
when it still seemed possible that a counter-bid by Lloyds Bank might force
higher bid terms from Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking. There were reports of
substantial losses by some securities houses. Traders also had to grapple
with increased activity in British Steel, British Airways and Glaxo.
focused itself around the prospects for the next expiry of the stock index
future contract in the middle of this month. Futures expiries have
traditionally created presures on share prices as the big securities houses
struggle to balance their positions in futures contracts and the underlying
blue chip shares.
Traders believe that large bull positions built up in futures in the weeks
following the general election could make the expiry settlement difficult.
Although the market made little further move in the second half of the
session, there was hardly any recovery in the FT-SE Index which closed 22
points down at 2,614.1. The mood was gloomy, and several strategists
forecast that the Footsie 2,600 mark could come under pressure if Wall
Street, showing a fall of 15 Dow points in London trading hours, continued
to give way.
Store and retail stocks gave ground after the latest survey of distributive
trades by the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) had indicated a
slowdown in retail sales in May, reversing the post-election uptick.
Most of the fund management core stocks came under pressure, with ICI,
Glaxo, Reuters and Wellcome all recording sharp falls. The building and
construction sector suffered a further setback as equity analysts digested
the latest developments at Regalian, one of Britain's best-known property
groups, where the accounts were qualified by the auditors in view of the
'very considerable uncertainty' affecting property markets.
By the end of the day, the stock market was sounding somewhat demoralised,
and was beset by renewed hints that a large rights issue might be pending.

FT  12 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures retreated on the back of the overnight falls on Wall
street, though turnover was greatly improved on recent levels, writes Joel
Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE started the session at around the 2,640 level
and immediately saw selling activity which sent it falling to 2,623 by 10am,
and helped send the underlying cash market lower.
The poor distributive sales survey from the CBI only served to increased the
downward pressure on June, but nerves steadied mid session and a bout of
sideways trading followed thereafter. However the poor opening on Wall
Street once again led dealers to sell the contract, though a feeling that
earlier falls had been overdone helped June recover towards the close of the
market. June closed at 2,629, down 20 on the previous session but around 10
points above its estimated fair value premium of about 6. Notably, the
contract spent much of the session at a premium to fair value. Turnover was
a healthy 10,025 contracts.
The turnover in the traded options also saw a big improvement on recent
levels. A total of 37,662 contracts had changed hands by the close. The
FT-SE option traded 19,715 lots. Glaxo was the busiest stock option with a
day's total of 1,838.

FT  12 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Bourses fall on extended
weakness in US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EXTENDED weakness of Wall Street, and further worries over Maastricht
left bourses generally weak yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS lost another 1 per cent as the CAC-40 closed down 24.89 at 1,928.84 in
good turnover of FFr3bn.
News that St Gobain was not planning a capital increase failed to filter
into the market before the close, and the shares finished down FFr12.00 at
FFr554.00.
Michelin had a poor day, off FFr7.60 at FFr207.40, having earlier touched
FFr204. Some analysts said that this may have been due to the poor
performance of Goodyear's stock in the US overnight.
The dropping of Eurotunnel from the FT-100 index in the UK depressed the
stock, which closed FFr1.50 lower at FFr34.20, with the warrants 5 centimes
down at 23 centimes. Meanwhile the theme park operator, Euro Disney, had a
slightly better day, gaining 20 centimes to FFr114.20.
Schneider was again hard hit, losing FFr16.00 to FFr666.00, with the
authorities saying that the recent sharp fall in the shares was to be
investigated; and Casino's acquisition of therival stores group, Rallye,
continued to weigh on sentiment as its shares dipped FFr7.80 to FFr157.90.
Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez was one of the few stocks to buck the trend,
gaining FFr6.00 to FFr543.00 following positive remarks at its annual
meeting and news that it was to sell its stake in Havas.
FRANKFURT drifted lower again, the DAX ending down 7.95 at 1,781.81 after a
0.84 decline to 710.99 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume rose to DM5.3bn from
DM4.9bn.
Big losers on the day included Lufthansa, Karstadt and MAN, down DM4.50 to
DM125.50, DM15.50 to DM623.50 and DM4.80 to DM395 respectively. Karstadt
produced the main news, including lower profits, flat DVFA earnings and
optimism on 1992 prospects, but this came to nothing as Deutsche Bank's
research unit lowered its earnings expectations for the retailer.
Lufthansa has been weak on the North Atlantic airfare price war and MAN,
said dealers, was a victim of the futures market. Meanwhile, the flurry in
Continental ended again, the tyremaker's shares falling DM5.50 to DM272.50.
MILAN suffered further embarassment as its computer-based trading system, on
which 35 issues are listed, was turned off for the rest of the week by the
regulator, Consob, following repeated breakdowns in the past few days.
Activity was further disturbed by a partial power failure, which switched
off the automatic price transmission system. The Comit index fell another
3.70 to 477.37.
ZURICH was led down by financials again, the SMI index of leading shares
losing 19.2 at 1,868.8, but the pharmaceuticals group, Roche, stood out
against the trend with its bearers steady at SFr4,750 and its certificates
only SFr10 lower at SFr3,310, ahead of a meeting with analysts today.
Mr Mark Tracey of Goldman Sachs said that the broker had put Roche
certficates on its recommended list, liking a 1992 p/e of 15.7 against an
estimated eps growth rate of 20 per cent per annum over the next five years.
Mr Tracey says that Roche has the new products to give it double-digit
volume growth prospects,and scope for an improvement in profit margins.
STOCKHOLM's banks recovered by 1.4 per cent as the Affarsvarlden General
index fell another 6.3 to 953.5. Handelsbanken, whose results are due next
week, rose SKr2 to SKr52.50.
The forestry group, SCA, closed SKr2 lower at SKr113 on profits lower than
expected. However, the real estate and building sector was the main loser
with a drop of 3 per cent.
OSLO saw various degrees of disappointment in the results from the insurer,
Uni Storebrand, the holding company, Orkla, and the shipping company,
Bergesen, which fell NKr2 to NKr45.50, NKr2.50 to NKr160.50, and NKr1.50 to
NKr106 respectively as the all share index closed 2.32 lower at 437.86.
COPENHAGEN hit a new low for the year, writes Hilary Barnes, the all share
index falling 2.60 to 325.29. The index has lost 6.5 per cent since
Denmark's referendum last week. Dealers said that banks led the fall
yesterday, because of the steady drop in bond prices. However, gloom over
insurers after UNI Storebrand's bad first-period results sector pushed down
Baltica, which fell DKr55 to DKr525; and Hafnia, an earlier target for Uni's
pan-Nordic ambitions, fell another DKr5 to DKr115.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency index closed 0.8 lower at 129.6. Over-capacity in
aluminium saw Hoogovens and Hunter Douglas both registering falls, of Fl
1.10 and 20 cents respectively to Fl 57.10 and Fl 68.80. A large sale of
Philips stock by a foreign investor left the shares 50 cents down at Fl
37.70, while KLM weakened 60 cents to Fl 39.30 as the transatlantic price
war begins to bite.

FT  12 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Madrid stumbles but keeps its head -
Spain's austerity package has spurred the recent market rally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR Spaniards, who do not eat Danish bacon because their own jamon serrano
is infinitely superior and who prefer their fried dough churros to any
sophisticated Danish pastry, it was a shock to be tripped up by a country
they knew little about and cared less.
Worse still was learning that the Danes, with their prosperous,
well-balanced economy, had rejected the Maastricht treaty whose convergence
criteria Spain, both deficit and inflation-prone, was making extraordinary
efforts to meet.
The mix of surprise and injured pride sent the the Spanish markets into a
tailspin last week. Denmark's 'no' to Maastricht all but wiped out a May
rally which had raised Madrid's general index by more than 10 points and
pushed it past the psychologically important 260 barrier.
Some brokers believed that the rally would continue and that the index's
high this year - 266.5 at the end of February - was within reach. Then,
after last week's referendum, they were like players on a football field
where an unseen hand had moved the goalposts. The index closed 2.07 down
yesterday at 249.27.
Foreigners did not think much of the domestic pitch either, and hammered the
Spanish bond market, so depressing the 10-year bond to December 1991 levels.
But there are some who are managing to keep their heads while all about them
are seemingly losing theirs. 'The market is reacting with a quasi-panic
which is quite out of proportion,' says Mr Juan Cueto, head of research at
Gestemar, Banco de Progreso's broking arm.
'Whether there is a (Maastricht) treaty or not, Spain's economy will
continue to converge with those of northern Europe,' says Mr Michael Hyman,
the chief investment officer of GH Asset Management in London. 'Spain is,
without a doubt, one of the most attractive investments in the EC.'
Such upbeat perceptions owe a great deal to the austerity programme,
appropriately known as the Plan de Convergencia, that the government has
drawn up and has vowed to adhere to. Last month, it stuck to its guns on
austerity when it endured a half-day general strike called by the unions
against proposed cuts in unemployment benefit, which are central to the
programme.
It was precisely this doggedness, together with the fact that the protest
strike was only supported by some 34 per cent of workers, that spurred the
May market rally. If the government manages to maintain its determined
battle against inflation and public spending then, it is claimed, much of
the havoc wrought upon the markets could be repaired.
Such thinking assumes that the economy is on course for recovery and that
the government will deliver. This is more important now than ever because
analysts are no longer looking at a Spain which is being cheered on by
pan-EC convergence fever, but one which might well be left to its own
devices.
The government had hoped to lower the fiscal deficit this year but, after
reviewing spending during the first quarter, the Bank of Spain warned that
the deficit could instead rise by half a point to stand at 5 per cent of GDP
by December. '1992 is going to be a write-off as far as deficit reductions
are concerned,' says Mr Jaime de Pinies, chief of research at the Banco
Santander de Negocios.
Mr Diego Prado, a partner at Carnegie Espana, believes that virtually the
sole chance of a positive signal which might spark life into the domestic
market lies with the 1992 budget. Although this will not be unveiled
formally until October, its main outline is normally leaked ahead of the
parliamentary recess at the end of July.
In the absence of such signals, there are brokers such as Mr Ramiro Mato,
chief executive of Argentaria Capital, the equities division of the public
sector financial services group, who believe that there will now be a
possibly prolonged lull in the market, punctuated by the odd rally.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CAUTIOUSNESS prevailed ahead of today's futures and options expiry, and
share prices fluctuated within a narrow range in low volume, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 33.82 to 17,709.05 after a high of 17,885.69 and a
low of 17,648.94. Volume fell to 230m shares from 270m.
Advances led declines by 461 to 444 with 192 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks fell 1.70 to 1,345.54 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.28 to 1056.87.
According to the Tokyo Stock Exchange, arbitrage cash positions against the
June futures fell for four consecutive weeks to Y379bn as of Wednesday. The
amount is significantly lower than the position of Y640bn held against March
contracts a week before expiry, and most market participants were optimistic
about the unwinding process.
Mr Yasuo Ueki at Nikko Securities said: 'Even if the index declines, it will
only be temporary, since institutions have indicated interest in buying at
cheaper levels.'
However, some traders maintained a cautious stance. 'Although the balance of
cash positions has become small, unwinding amid the low liquidity on the
cash market could cause ugly results,' said Mr Steve Claussen at SBCI
Securities.
Some institutional investors joined short-term trading of speculative theme
stocks by dealers. Meiji Milk Products, the most active issue of the day,
rose Y26 to Y1,020 and Morinaga Milk advanced Y36 to the year's high of
Y904.
Environmental stocks were also higher, with Chiyoda, the plant engineer, up
Y70 to Y1,900 and Japan Storage Battery advancing Y50 to Y1,130.
Nippon Formula Feed, the livestock feedstuff manufacturer, rose Y50 to
Y1,130.
Nippon Express, the parcel delivery company, rose Y17 to Y734 on buying by
foreign investors. Nippon Express posted a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits for the last fiscal year, and expects a modest rise in profits this
year.
Banking issues were lower, with trust banks posting sharp falls. Trust banks
face deteriorating loan portfolios and a decline in margin fees due to the
fall in the stock and real estate markets. Moody's Investment Service, the
US credit agency, this week lowered debt ratings of four of the seven trust
banks. Mitsui Trust and Banking fell Y28 to a year's low of Y740, while
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking fell Y21 to Y888.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined 57.89 to 20,541.80 in volume of 14.9m
shares.
Roundup
SINGAPORE, Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta were all closed for public holidays
yesterday, while Bombay closed its doors again to facilitate settlement
work.
BANGKOK soared in heavy turnover of Bt11.6bn, the SET index gaining 49.85,
or 7.3 per cent to 737.23 on the reappointment of Anand Panyarachun as prime
minister, with many shares closing up at their 10 per cent ceiling limits.
MANILA stayed strong on the sentiment which has lifted the composite index
to new highs, the latest yesterday, since last month's presidential
election. The composite index rose 7.61 to 1,580.95 ahead of today's
Independence Day holiday.
SEOUL extended Wednesday's minor rebound from Tuesday's 1992 low, the
composite index closing 7.63 higher at 570.50 in volume up from Won207bn to
Won270bn. Share prices were lifted by technical factors and improved
sentiment.
Senior markets were less sanguine, HONG KONG closing sharply lower on
weakness on Wall Street, and profit-taking, while AUSTRALIA hit its lowest
close for six weeks, with banks leading the way down.
Renewed weakness in HSBC, parent of the Hongkong Bank, dragged down the Hang
Seng index which closed 90.96 lower at 5,826.54. Rumours of possible rights
issues by Cheung Kong or affiliate Hutchison Whampoa also hit the market.
HSBC fell HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 44.25, Cheung Kong by 30 cents to
HKDollars 25.50 and Hutchison by 40 cents to HKDollars 18.60.
Australian brokers said that dividend stripping of banking stocks boosted
volumes to a total of 127.2m shares worth ADollars 397.8m. The banking
sector fell 34.6, or 1.65 per cent to 2,058.3.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips on poor sales data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The dollar slid sharply against the D-Mark in late European trading
yesterday after poor inflation and retail sales data exacerbated dealers'
worries about the scope of the US economic recovery, writes James Blitz.
The dollar slipped nearly two pfennigs to DM1.5755 after May's retail sales
figures showed a rise of just 0.2 per cent. A 0.7 per cent rise had been
expected. The producer price index for May was also disappointing for dollar
holders, showing an overall rise of 0.4 per cent when the market was
expecting a 0.3 per cent rise.
Although the dollar recovered later on, it closed in London at DM1.5790
compared to a previous close of DM1.5930. 'Economic fundamentals are still
underpinning the dollar in the longer term,' said Mr Michael Feeny of
Sumitomo Bank in London. 'But if you are buying the dollar, you still have
to account for the huge cost of carry because of low US interest rates.'
The D-Mark's gains against the dollar were mirrored in Europe after Mr Theo
Waigel, the German finance Minister, reiterated Germany's criticisms of the
terms for European monetary union (Emu). He told a German newspaper that the
plan to increase the European community budget by one third by 1997 was
'unacceptable,' and this boosted the D-Mark against most European
currencies.
This was compounded by other indications that European Monetary convergence
is in difficulty. Germany's federal states threatened to reject the
Maastricht treaty; Britain's newspapers carried stories that Mr John Major's
commitment to Emu has weakened considerably; and France's senate seriously
complicated its government's efforts to hasten ratification of the treaty,
by adopting an amendment aimed at restricting EC legislation.
That last factor ensured that the French franc was the biggest loser of the
day, closing at FFr3.3690 to the D-Mark compared to a previous close of
FFr3.3670. Sterling also lost ground again to the D-Mark, closing at
DM2.9150 from a previous finish of DM2.9220. It was also bottom of the
European Monetary System grid once again.
The Italian lira ended weaker again at Lira756.40 to the D-Mark from a
previous finish of Lira755.8. The Bank of Spain tried to stem the peseta's
losses by intervening to buy its currency in the morning at Pta63.04. It's
success was only limited. The peseta ended the day at Pta63.09 to the D-Mark
from a previous close of Pta62.91.
The yen rose against the dollar after Mr David Mulford, the US Treasury
Undersecretary, said that the yen's recent rise had been 'appropriate.' The
dollar closed at Y126.80 from a previous close of Y127.50.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Short rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT rates in the sterling cash market were slightly softer yesterday after
the Bank of England forecast a shortage of only Pounds 100m in its morning
operations.
The overnight rate dropped to 9 1/2 per cent from yesterday's close of
around 10 per cent, after the Bank announced the small shortage. It later
dropped further to a low of 8 1/2 per cent, but closed at 9 1/4 per cent.
1-month sterling libor ended at 9 7/8 per cent from a previous close of 9
15/16 per cent. Everything from 2-month to 3-month sterling libor ended down
 1/16 per cent at 9 15/16 per cent on the day.
Traders said that the softening of rates was due to purely technical
factors. However, the market appears to have shrugged off the temptation to
be bearish about base rates after sterling dropped nearly 3/4 of a pfennig
on the foreign exchange markets.
One discount house dealer said he was surprised that longer term rates for
sterling libor were softer following sterling's losses. Another trader said
that the market was so dead yesterday that it would have been hard for any
factor to move it significantly one way or the other.
The market's attention is now focused on the big shortages that will arise
in the next fortnight as the second quarter comes to an end. Yesterday,
traders were positioning themselves for the much tighter credit conditions
expected next week. 1-week and 2-week money was keenly bid, and short-dated
paper was sold with the aim of buying it back in due course at higher rates.
The market waited until the afternoon to take out the shortage. The Bank
purchased Pounds 22m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 100m
of Band-2 bank bills also at 9 7/8 per cent.
Sterling futures were mostly unchanged. The September contract closed at
90.23, up one tick. This reflects the market's view that 3-month sterling
libor in September will be at 9.77 per cent. December sterling ended the day
unchanged at 90.48, reflecting the view that 3-month libor will be at 9.52
per cent by the end of the year.
Some traders still see these figures as rather bearish over base rates, with
the market barely discounting a  1/2 per cent cut between now and the end of
the year.

Robusta COFFEE prices closed weaker in London, while arabicas were down at
midday in New York. The market will probably test life-of-contract lows, one
New York trader said - 'There is no reason right now for prices to go up'.
Technically, the market is in a downtrend and there is no fresh supportive
fundamental news until the ICO meeting in London on June 22. London
September COCOA hit a new 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 531 a tonne, but
recovered some of the loss by the close. Dealers said the prospect of
further sales by the Ivory Coast - on holiday yesterday - continued to weigh
on sentiment. ZINC prices rallied form earlier 2 1/2 -month lows by the
close on the LME. Continued technical tightness kept the premium for cash
metal over three-month at Dollars 172 a tonne. PLATINUM'S brief rally met
resistance at Dollars 370 a troy ounce on the London bullion market. Earlier
speculative US commission house buying on Nymex triggered buy stops after
weak US retail sales data helped to revive speculation of a US interest rate
cut. The white metal was fixed at Dollars 370 in the afternoon, up just over
Dollars 2 from the morning fix, before it slipped back in the face of
initial upward resistance, London dealers said.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Paribas rating maintained

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PARIBAS, one of France's leading investment banks, has emerged unscathed
from a review by Moody's, the international credit rating agency, which has
decided against downgrading the rating on its long-term debt after a
six-month review.
Moody's, which put Paribas under surveillance pending a possible downgrade
in January, yesterday announced it had decided to maintain the bank's
long-term rating at Aa2.
The review coincided with a difficult period for Paribas which recently
disclosed it had gone into the red for the first time in its history in
1991, with a net loss of FFr184m - due to a steep increase rise in
provisions.
Standard &amp; Poor's, another leading US credit rating agency, announced in
April it was downgrading Paribas from AA to AA minus.
However, Moody's decided against a downgrading because it believed 'the
deterioration of its asset quality and profitability will be limited in time
and will not threaten the bank's strong business franchise or its good
financial fundamentals'.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Bonds: French deal meets firm demand despite
heavy supply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DESPITE heavy supply and a slightly weaker market, a FFr2bn nine-year deal
for Caisse Nationale des Autoroutes, the French motorway financing agency,
met firm demand.
Dealers said that the 9 per cent bonds were considered reasonably priced to
yield 35 basis points above the comparable French government bond, with
demand concentrated among overseas investors.
Domestic investors remain rather more worried amount the political
uncertainty in the wake of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty last
week.
In addition to the CNA deal, Caisse Centrale de Cooperation Economique
(CCCE) launched a FFr1bn deal in the domestic market. Elsewhere, the market
was dominated by a number of Latin American deals.
Lehman Brothers launched an innovative bond issue backed by the revenue from
a Mexican toll-road. MCTTR-TRIPS (Toll Revenue Indexed Participation
Securities for the Mexico City - Toluca Toll Road) is the first of a series
of deals in the privatisation of Mexico's road infrastructure.
Three more principal roads are expected to be financed in the same way.
The development of Mexico's infrastructure has in the past been financed
solely by the Mexican government.
The Dollars 207m deal, issued in the form of global depositary units, will
be used to repay a government grant.
The bonds, which have an average life of seven-years, will be priced later
today to yield 11.15 per cent to 11.40 per cent.
Elsewhere, Merrill Lynch structured a Dollars 100m repackaging of Bonex
floating rate notes through special purpose vehicle, Argentina Bonex 1989
Trust. The fixed-rate seven-year bonds are priced to yield just over 11 per
cent.
Autolatina Brasil launched a Dollars 100m five-year deal via ABN Amro, which
had not been priced by the end of trading yesterday.
Societe Generale has launched an issue of 5m call warrants on the shares of
Northern Foods, the UK food company.
The warrants give the holders the right to buy shares at 615p per share, a
premium of 17.3 per cent.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: GPA deal creates new source
of funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE first securitisation of aircraft leases by GPA, the Irish leasing
company, yesterday has created a new source of funding for the ailing
airline industry.
The Dollars 521m issue, arranged by Citibank, is backed by 14 aircraft
purchased by GPA and leased to airlines including British Midland Airways,
Philippine Airlines and Spanair.
'It opens up a new investor base for the financing of aircraft in the 1990s,
in an industry which is projecting significant financing needs', said Mr
Andrew Pisker, a managing director of Lehman Brothers, joint lead manager of
the transaction.
According to Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency, the funding costs of new
aircraft over the next 20 years will amount to around Dollars 850bn.
The airline industry has been particularly hard hit by economic recession.
Many have been unprofitable and have seen their credit ratings dip
dramatically. Banks have also been tightening their belts so their
traditional source of financing through bank loans has dried up.
Japanese investment in aircraft leases, fuelled by tax benefits, has also
tailed off as tax advantages have disappeared.
The GPA deal is made up of five tranches: two public offerings consisting of
Dollars 208.4m fixed-rate bonds and Dollars 104.2m floating-rate notes; a
Dollars 70.4m private placement; and two tranches of subordinated debt.
The bonds have been rated AA by S&amp;P. The rating is based on the rental flow
from the carriers, over Dollars 8m in security deposits, the security of the
aircraft and an additional Dollars 78m loan from Citibank and Credit
Lyonnais.
The deal is expected to be imitated by airline companies, although the
diversification of aircraft achieved in the GPA pool will be difficult for
some to achieve. GPA, whose public offer of 85m shares closes on June 16, is
expected to develop a programme for the securitisation of lease pools.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Italian bond dealers demand
delivery ruling
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MILAN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOND dealers in Italy yesterday demanded an urgent clarification of the
rules on settlement procedures following differences that emerged this week
with some foreign counterparties over delivery.
'I have spent most of the past two days arguing with foreign customers about
this', said one angry dealer in Milan yesterday. 'Reimbursement is not
enough'.
However, Italian traders contacted universally criticised houses which,
according to some London-based dealers, have refused to recognise, on the
grounds of late delivery, trades conducted during last week's turbulent
markets.
'Milan may have different settlement rules than the Eurobond market, but a
trade is a trade', said one dealer.
The Italian government bond market has a three-day delivery period, unlike
the seven-day period for Eurobonds. Moreover, the Italian system does not
allow for bond borrowing, leaving Italian intermediaries highly exposed when
foreign clients have been late to deliver paper.
'We had to replace the bonds our clients couldn't deliver, which was both
difficult and expensive'. noted one trader. 'If they're trading in Italian
paper, they should know what the rules are.'
Many foreign banks plunged into the Italian market last week on account of
the appealing spreads that emerged between the cash and futures markets,
selling short in the cash market in the hope of buying back later. Italian
traders involved were holding urgent talks with foreign clients over ways to
resolve the disagreements. A few said they would be pressing for some form
of token penalty on clients which failed to deliver bonds in time as well as
the reimbursement of expenses.
The International Securities Market Association (ISMA), is seeking to
resolve the issue, while the Bank of Italy stated its strong disapproval of
late delivery.
Meanwhile, several London-based banks said they accepted demands for
additional payments where they had failed to deliver, but would not accept
claims that trades had failed.
Disagreement over settlement procedures has been highlighted due to the high
number of trades which were not completed due to turbulent market conditions
last week, as the market fell several points following the result of the
Danish referendum on Maastricht.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Tightening of controls on
Japanese non-banks delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROTRACTED parliamentary debate over Japanese peace-keeping personnel
has delayed the passage of amendments tightening the Ministry of Finance's
control over Japan's non-banking financial sector.
Non-banks, meaning consumer credit, leasing and housing finance companies,
have become the Japanese financial establishment's favourite scapegoat for
the rampant lending for stock and land speculation in the late 1980s.
In wanting to be seen to be tackling speculation, the Finance Ministry, with
broad support from Japanese politicians, has proposed revisions of the Loan
Business Law that will force the non-bank institutions to provide more
information about their business activities.
By pushing for the changes, the ministry is extending its authority over a
sector which has been the responsibility of the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (Miti), as non-banks such as leasing companies are in
Japan more closely identified with industry.
Miti does not oppose these amendments, which may be presented to parliament
today, depending on the fate of the peacekeeping debate, but it is concerned
that increasingly tough controls will strangle the companies' important
industrial role.
The non-banks are concerned by the vague wording of the proposed amendments.
For example, it is proposed that the Finance Ministry exercise greater
authority over the institutions' loans related to 'stocks, etcetera'.
'We are very worried about that etcetera,' said Nippon Shinpan, the
country's largest consumer credit company. 'A lot depends on how they
interpret etcetera. We are watching very closely.'
Mr Tsutomu Hata, the finance minister, argues that non-bank lending has
grown 'quite quickly' over the past few years, and 'we need rules to ensure
their credibility'.
From last March, the ministry was empowered to gather information on
non-banks' property loan exposure, and the planned revisions will allow it
to demand details about other types of loans and about large customers.
Part of the concern of companies such as Nippon Shinpan is that the ministry
will continue to crack down on so-called 'non-banks', while taking a softer
line on the bank non-banks, the affiliates of commercial banks which were
particularly active speculative lenders during the late 1980s.
Leading Japanese banks have links to hundreds of these non-banks, and the
Finance Ministry is keen to play down their problem loans as it was
responsible for their behaviour and because it wants to ease fears about the
health of the banking system.
The non-banks independent of banks fear that the ministry is using
parliamentary concern about collapsing stock and land prices to fulfil a
long-held ambition to restrict their activities. However, the ministry
insists a tightening of control is a necessary result of the non-banks'
larger lending role.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Threat to Bond Corp
reconstruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN Consolidated Investments (Acil) yesterday withdrew from the
management committee overseeing the financial reconstruction of Bond
Corporation Holdings, formerly run by Mr Alan Bond, the bankrupt
entrepreneur. The withdrawal, announced in a statement to the Australian
Stock Exchange, could cause the collapse of the reconstruction, and force
Bond Corp to put its few remaining assets into liquidation.
It follows an earlier decision by Acil to stop working capital payments of
up to ADollars 1m a month, provided for under a scheme of arrangement worked
out last year between Bond Corp and its creditors.
However, officials said Bond Corp might be capable of financing its
scaled-down operations from other sources, allowing it to continue the
reconstruction without the co-operation of Acil.
Acil, formerly Mr Robert Holmes a Court's Bell Resources, is Bond Corp's
largest secured creditor. It would emerge with about 11 per cent of the
group's capital under a scheme of arrangement worked out last year.
Acil is believed to be in dispute with Bond Corp management over the group's
use of its working capital payments, and the repayment of Bond Corp's debt
to Acil of about ADollars 168m (USDollars 128.20m).
Most of Bond Corp's assets have been sold to pay debts. The group retains
small shareholdings in BSkyB, the UK satellite television operator, and G.
Heilemann, the US brewery. It also owns land in Australia.
Separately, Acil announced the cancellation of a proposed ADollars 220m
flotation of the Bass Strait oil royalties owned by Weeks Petroleum, a
wholly-owned subsidiary company.
Mr Colin Henson, executive director, said the acquisition of Acil by
Rossington Holdings, a bidding vehicle controlled by Sir Ron Brierley, had
'changed the assumptions on which the float was to proceed'.
Rossington, jointly-owned by Brierley Investments of New Zealand and GPG,
Sir Ron's quoted UK company, owns 85 per cent of Acil following a protracted
takeover battle.
Rossington made no secret of its opposition to the float of Weeks'
royalties, which it claimed were being disposed of too cheaply. At one
stage, Rossington took court action to delay the despatch of the offer
documents.
Mr Bond, who was jailed for two and a half years last month for breaches of
company law, is expected to remain in Royal Perth Hospital for several days
for tests to determine the cause of chest pains.
His condition was said to be stable. The state's supreme court is expected
to rule today on an application for bail pending an appeal against
conviction and sentence.
In Sydney, the federal court granted an order to Mr Robert Ramsay, trustee
of Mr Bond's bankrupt estate, freezing the assets of Mr Bond's ADollars 2.7m
pension fund.
The order restrains the trustees of the fund from dealing with the assets
other than in an administrative way until the court decides who is entitled
to them. Mr Ramsay claims the assets belong to Mr Bond's creditors.

Hardie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAMES Hardie Industries, the Australian building products group, yesterday
announced a 92 per cent reduction in net profit, to ADollars 5.9m (USDollars
4.5m), for the year to the end of March. Sales were ahead 4.6 per cent to
ADollars 1.3bn.
The reduction in net profit was caused by an abnormal loss of ADollars 73m
following a decision to write down the value of intangible assets and the
group's investment portfolio.
Mr David Say, managing director, said the writedown followed plant closures
caused by rationalisation, and the introduction of a revised accounting
standard on the valuation of assets.
CSR, the building products and sugar group, recently announced a net loss of
ADollars 385m after writing down plant, equipment, goodwill and trademarks
by ADollars 558m to comply with the revised standard.
The abnormal loss at James Hardie was dominated by a ADollars 57m provision
against the cost of closing three fibre cement plants in Australia. The
group also wrote off ADollars 37m against a US cement plant, ADollars 15m
against intangible assets, and ADollars 19m to bring investments into line
with market values.
The write-offs were partly offset by a ADollars 56m abnormal gain from the
sale of James Hardie's 45 per cent shareholding in Spicers Paper late last
year.
The board cut the final dividend by 25 per cent to 6 cents, partly franked,
making a total dividend for the year of 12 cents, compared with 17 cents the
previous year.
Mr Say said the group would restore the dividend as soon as profits
improved. However, there were only patchy signs of recovery, and the outlook
for the current year was unclear.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: Sony breaks silence on Mini Disc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SONY, the Japanese electronics group, is gearing up its marketing and
publicity campaign for the introduction of its Mini Disc, an 8cm recordable
compact disc which it hopes will capture the portable music market, valued
at well over Dollars 10bn.
After a prolonged silence, which aroused speculation that the Mini Disc was
facing technical difficulties, Sony has recently been demonstrating its
product throughout world markets. It wants to dispel ideas that Mini Disc is
being overshadowed by a rival product, the digital compact cassette (DCC),
to be launched by Philips later this year.
'Product development is progressing on schedule,' Sony said at a Europe-wide
demonstration in Salzburg this week. 'We now have the facts and can start
talking.'
A crucial technology which Sony demonstrated at Salzburg was the recording
capability of Mini Disc, which had been of particular interest among
industry-watchers.
Prototype models of the Mini Disc player shown included a gold radio
cassette boom box model, a lightweight playback-only Mini Disc Walkman, and
a slightly heavier recordable Walkman.
Sony said the hardware, planned for introduction in Europe by Christmas,
would be priced at below DM1,000 (Dollars 625) for playback-only models, and
25 per cent more for a portable record/playback unit.
It plans to ship 1m hardware units in the first year of production, with
250,000 allotted for Europe.
Pre-recorded discs, of which there will be an initial 300 titles, are
expected to cost about the same price as Compact Discs, while blank discs
will be priced at around DM15.
Three of Sony's own production facilities in Japan, the US and Europe are
ready to produce a total of 1.5m discs worldwide within the year.
Breaking the silence about the Mini Disc should go some way in dispelling
rumours that Sony's new product was plagued by a difficult technology, and a
format that was too different and too small to appeal to either consumers or
retailers.
The group has addressed the problem of the size - which would have forced
retailers to invest in completely new racks for display - by fitting the 7cm
by 8cm discs into a case as big as, and shaped like, a cassette tape case.
However, Sony, whose Mini Disc will be competing with DCC, a digital audio
cassette to be launched by Philips and its licensees, still has some
catching up to do in marketing and publicity.
Its Dutch rival, which has shown a previously-unknown zeal for marketing the
product, has already won widespread industry support from hardware
manufacturers and recording companies.
Sony, by contrast, has lagged behind Philips in winning industry support.
There have been signs of resistance within the software industry to a
product that they worry could kill CD sales.
Recording companies to have signed up to release music on Mini Disc format
include Sony Music Entertainment and EMI. Negotiations are still continuing
with Warner Music Group, a division of Time Warner. Polygram, which is 80
per cent-owned by Philips, has no plans yet to release on Mini Disc.
Sony, which has been set back recently, first with the failure of Betacom,
its VCR format, and then with digital audio tape, is nevertheless confident
that consumers, if not record companies, will vote for its technology.
Sony believes the main reason cassette tape sales have fallen is because of
their lack of random access, which Mini Disc has but DCC, being a tape, does
not.
'DCC is not the right product to address the demands of consumers,' it says.
And once consumers show their preference for Mini Disc, record companies
will not be able to dictate what medium their artists record on.

sharply

<TEXT>
SCA, Sweden's second-largest forestry company, yesterday announced a sharp
drop in profits (after financial items) for the first four months of the
year, to SKr204m (Dollars 35.47m) from SKr1.10bn for the same period of
1991. Net sales dropped to SKr10.60bn from SKr11.52bn.
Mr Martin Lof, chief executive, forecast profit (after financial items) for
the whole of 1992 would be between SKr400m and SKr500m. This compares with a
profit of SKr1.22bn for last year.
SCA has been able to cushion the full impact of the recession in the pulp
and paper industry through its extensive restructuring programme, designed
to produce savings of SKr1bn. The company estimated that there had been
savings of SKr365m in the first four months of this year.
The company has a much more diversified range of products than other Swedish
forestry groups. This, however, has not stopped the fierce price war in the
industry and the continuing weak demand from affecting its sales of paper
and pulp products.
Operating profit for the packaging business fell in the first four months by
21 per cent, to SKr161m from SKr203m. It made an actual loss of SKr94m in
its graphic paper division compared with a SKr106m profit last time.
SCA's operating profit in forest and timber activities dropped 27 per cent,
to SKr100m from SKr159m. By contrast, there was a 7 per cent improvement in
its operating profit for hygiene products, to SKr252m from SKr235m, due to
higher volumes and improved production efficiency.
Mr Lof said SCA's recovery depended on the pace of the business revival in
the US and Europe. He said there were some welcome signs of an upturn in the
US packaging industry, with a particularly sharp improvement in volume in
the corrugated liner sector.

CIRCLE K, the Arizona-based convenience store chain, has signed a definitive
agreement for the sale of its business to CK Acquisitions, an investor group
led by Bahrain-based Investcorp.
The price tag, however, is only Dollars 375m, compared with Dollars 425m
envisaged under a preliminary accord three months ago.
Circle K filed for bankruptcy protection over two years ago, and the deal is
subject to approvals from both the bankruptcy court and the company's
creditors.
The preliminary agreement was opposed by the official bondholders' committee
at Circle K, although three other creditor groups have already said that
they support the revised deal.
Circle K operates some 3,400 convenience stores in 32 states.
Investcorp and its partners, meanwhile, have built up significant retail
interests in the US - most notably, acquiring Saks Fifth Avenue, the
department store chain, from Britain's BAT Industries.
Child World, the ailing toy retailer which is also operating under the
protection of Chapter 11 of the US bankruptcy code, has petitioned the
courts for permission to liquidate stocks and close remaining stores.
The company said it was in talks with Lionel Corporation about merging the
two companies' businesses, but that in the absence of an agreement, it
expects to initiate going-out-of-business sales 'within a short period of
time'.
A bankruptcy court hearing has been set for June 15.

LYONNAISE des Eaux Dumez, the French water utility-to- construction group,
yesterday forecast a 20 per cent profits recovery for the current year and
said more asset sales were on the way.
Mr Jerome Monod, chairman, said that the group expected to achieve the
earnings improvement despite the continuing poor climate in building and
construction.
Net profits last year fell to FFr1.17bn (Dollars 218.3m) from FFr1.4bn in
1990.
Mr Monod said the group was planning to sell a 2 per cent stake in Havas,
the French media group, next month and its remaining 1.9 per cent in Havas
some time in the next year.
The group was also planning to sell United Westburne, its lossmaking
Canadian building materials subsidiary, but not before 1993, by when United
Westburne should be breaking even.
The group made a FFr1.87bn profit from asset sales last year, in line with
its policy of focusing on its main businesses and curbing debts.
Mr Jean-Louis Beffa, chairman of Saint Gobain, the glass and pipe-making
group, yesterday forecast that net profits this year would exceed last
year's FFr2.5bn.
The US economy showed clear signs of recovery and sales in Germany were
holding up well, he told a shareholders' meeting.

WANG Laboratories, the US office computer company, has filed suit against
the US subsidiaries of Mitsubishi Electric and NMB Semiconductor, both of
Japan, charging that they are selling products that infringe Wang patents.
Wang claims Mitsubishi and NMB used its patented single in-line memory
module (SIMM) technology without license. A SIMM is a holder for multiple
memory chips that plugs into a computer circuit board to add memory
capacity. The devices are widely used in personal computers.
The suits are the latest move in an aggressive patent enforcement effort by
Wang. Last August, Wang won a similar case against NEC and Toshiba.
The US court awarded Wang damages of Dollars 3.3m and ordered the two
companies to halt manufacturing and sale of SIMMs in the US.
Since then, Wang has reached licensing agreements with over 30 US and
foreign companies.

<TEXT>
CONAGRA, the diversified US food group, expected earnings per share to show
only a small advance for the year ended May 31.
It predicted that earnings for the 12 months would be about Dollars 1.50 a
share, compared with Dollars 1.42 in 1990-91. Earnings for the final quarter
would probably be static at around 43 cents.
Some parts of ConAgra's business have faced tough operating conditions in
recent months. Its consumer frozen foods business has been embroiled in a
price-war, with ConAgra's Healthy Choice brand coming under intense pressure
from other manufacturers of reduced calorie frozen dinners, like Nestle and
Heinz.
On the cattle feed front, ConAgra said there was a return to profits 'a few
months ago', but it acknowledged that chicken products, like cattle feed,
experienced a cyclical downturn in 1991-92. It suggested results here could
improve 'meaningfully' in the new financial year, if industry supply was not
excessive.
ConAgra said 1992-93 earnings should rise 'significantly' in the last nine
months, after a flat first quarter.

approval of contraceptive
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
UPJOHN, the US drugs company, has applied to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in the hopes of getting approval to market an
injectable contraceptive product in the US.
The company said it would seek approval a second time to market the drug
Depo-Provera as a contraceptive.
In the 1970s, the FDA declined to give the green light for the drug's
marketing as a contraceptive because of questions about its safety. A board
of public inquiry, later asked by Upjohn to review the FDA decision, ruled
against the company in 1984.
The key concern at the FDA was data from an Upjohn study suggesting
Depo-Provera caused breast cancer in beagles. The FDA has since decided the
beagle dog was not an appropriate animal model for predicting cancer effects
in humans.
The drug is, however, already on the US market for use in treating kidney
and endometrial cancers. Analysts estimate its US sales at Dollars 108m,
while revenues from non-US markets, where the drug is sold in some 90
countries as a contraceptive and as an anti-cancer product, are estimated at
an additional Dollars 74m. More than 30m women in 60 countries are
understood to use the drug as a contraceptive.
Although Upjohn has not conducted any new studies of the drug since
withdrawing its last application, it has told the FDA a study by the World
Health Organisation concluded the use of Depo-Provera as a contraceptive did
not constitute a health risk.
Mr Melvin Goodes, chairman of Warner Lambert, the US pharmaceutical and
consumer products group, expects second-quarter 1992 net earnings per share
to rise by 13 per cent year-on-year, suggesting a net profit of about
Dollars 175m. Earnings per share would be about Dollars 1.30, against
Dollars 1.15 in the same period of 1991.
Mr Goodes said the rise would place Warner-Lambert on track to improve
full-year 1992 earnings by about 15 per cent. But full-year comparison is
only appropriate when comparing 1991 earnings before a Dollars 544m
accounting adjustment, and other restructuring charges. Net income in 1991
was only Dollars 34.8m after all charges were taken.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSLER, the US car-maker, is to appeal a federal jury's decision to fine
it Dollars 11.3m for infringing inventor Mr Robert Kearns' patent for
intermittment wipers, Reuter reports from Detroit.
'We believe the amount of the verdict is unreasonable and excessive, and far
exceeds any possible value of the Kearns' patents,' Chrysler said.
'Chrysler developed and patented its own intermittent windscreen wiper
system, which we believed and continue to believe did not infringe Mr
Kearns' patents.'
Mr Kearns, 64, won the patent case against Chrysler last December. A federal
jury found that Chrysler infringed on four patents for intermittment wiper
systems designed by Mr Kearns.
However, in the latest decision, the jury ruled Chrysler's infringement was
not wilful and ordered the company to pay Mr Kearns Dollars 0.90 for every
vehicle sold with the wiper system between May 1977 and August 1988.
According to court documents, Chrysler sold 12,564,107 vehicles during that
period.
Mr Kearns said he was seeking anywhere from Dollars 3 to nearly Dollars 30
per car, or Dollars 37.7m to Dollars 377m in damages. Had the jury found
Chrysler's actions wilful, US District Court Judge Avern Cohen could have
awarded Mr Kearns triple damages.
Mr Kearns, a former engineering professor, said he would also file an appeal
with the US Circuit Court of Appeals in Detroit to seek an extension of his
patents, which expired in 1988.

officers in finance arm
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS yesterday carried out a shake-up of the management of its
finance arm, including replacing the president and chief financial officer,
over an alleged Dollars 400m loan fraud.
The scandal centres on Mr John McNamara, a car dealer on Long Island, New
York, who last week pleaded not guilty to racketeering and fraud charges
involving the alleged diversion of more than Dollars 400m of loans from
General Motors Acceptance Corporation, the group's finance subsidiary, to
his personal investments.
GM said yesterday an internal investigation had uncovered no criminal
activity or self-dealing by any employee of GMAC, the group's largest profit
centre, producing net income of Dollars 1.3bn last year.
It announced a tightening of its credit procedures and management changes
with early retirement and 'special assignments' or other new jobs for six
senior GMAC officials.
Mr William Lovejoy, GMAC's president and chief operating officer, who is
replaced by Mr John Rines, 44, previously general manager of GM's service
parts operation. Mr George Fenner, chief financial officer, is replaced by
Mr John Finnegan, 43, previously a GM assistant treasurer.
The company said 'appropriate' disciplinary action was being taken against
other executive employees and staff at the GMAC branch office in New York
which serviced Mr McNamara's account.
Mr Robert O'Connell, the chairman of GMAC, has only been in his job since
May 1, when his predecessor, Mr John Edman, retired. Mr O'Connell was ousted
as chief financial officer to GM in a boardroom coup last April.
GM said its inquiry had not revealed systemic problems with GMAC's operating
and control procedures in its 'core business functions'. However, the
subsidiary would be expanding these procedures, particularly those involving
unusual financings and large credit exposures.
The prosecution claimed that Mr McNamara, whose car dealing family had a
43-year relationship with GM, borrowed billions in short-term loans from
GMAC between January 1985 and December 1991 to finance recreational vehicles
exported to Cyprus.
However, the vehicles did not exist and Mr McNamara allegedly repaid his old
loans with ever-increasing new ones, while siphoning off money for his own
use.

INTERNATIONALE Nederlanden Group (ING), the Dutch banking and insurance
company, said first-quarter net profit rose by 8.8 per cent to Fl 358m
(Dollars 200m), on turnover up 8 per cent at Fl 12.5bn.
The pre-tax profits of the group's insurance activities rose by 8.5 per cent
to Fl 228m, outstripping a 4.5 per cent increase to Fl 255m at NMB Postbank,
ING's banking arm.
Strong growth in international lending helped ING's total loan portfolio
expand by 3.1 per cent to Fl 130.4bn in the first quarter compared with the
quarter to December 31 1991. Although growth in the important domestic
lending sector was limited to less than 1 per cent, foreign lending rose by
13.1 per cent.
Fortis, the Belgian-Dutch insurance group, reported a 17.8 per cent rise in
first-quarter net profit to Ecu73.3m (Dollars 56.93m) with all main sectors
except car insurance posting higher results.
Operating profit grew more slowly, rising by 10.6 per cent to Ecu72.0m.
Revenues were up 22.9 per cent at Ecu2.3bn.
The rise in net profit was aided by a sharp increase in capital gains to
Ecu28.6m from Ecu17.0m. The company, formed in 1990 through the merger of
Amev, the Dutch insurer, and its Belgian counterpart Groupe AG, said
full-year capital gains may not reach the 1990 and 1991 levels.

UNI STOREBRAND, Norway's leading private insurance company, suffered a sharp
fall in profits in the first four months of the year to NKr26m (Dollars
4.17m) from NKr437m for the same period of 1991, it said yesterday.
The decline is partly due to the costs of trying to create a pan-Nordic
insurance conglomerate over the past seven months after buying 8 per cent of
Skandia, Sweden's leading insurance company.
Uni said it had lost NKr178m on the investment, including a NKr27m writedown
of shares that Uni also acquired in the Danish insurance group, Baltica, as
part of its pan-Nordic design.
The attempt to create a Nordic insurance giant has yet to be resolved. Uni
said it was holding further discussions with Skandia.
On top of its problems over Skandia, Uni said its profit decline was also
due to NKr123m paid out in insurance premiums for damage caused by the
hurricane which hit Norway's north-west coast last January, as well as a
NKr90m increase in allocations for personal injuries and a lower profit from
the company's investment portfolio.
But Uni said that the results laid the foundation for 'a substantial
improvement later in the year.'
Its life assurance company made a profit of NKr800m for the first four
months, with an increase of 20 per cent in premium income for life
assurance.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH stock market regulators have opened an inquiry into dealings in the
shares of Schneider, the electrical engineering and construction group.
The share prices of Schneider and its separately-quoted subsidiaries and
holding group fell steeply this week, ahead of a shareholders' meeting at
which Mr Didier Pineau-Valencienne, chairman, cut his profits forecast for
this year.
Schneider had earlier told a meeting of financial analysts that profits
would rise to about FFr400m (Dollars 73.93m) this year, instead of an
estimated FFr650m. This compares with a net profit of FFr275m last year, and
FFr923.9m in 1990. The readjustment reflects lower-than-expected earnings
from Merlin Gerin, an electrical equipment subsidiary, due to its customers'
caution over making internal investments.
The Commission des Operations de Bourse, the stock exchange watchdog, said
it was studying the way in which Schneider released this information as well
as the trade in the shares. Schneider's share price stood at FFr670
yesterday afternoon, 12.2 per cent down on the price on Tuesday, the day of
the analysts' meeting.
Analysts' interest in Schneider is intense, as the group is undergoing fast
change.

<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS expects the development of Air Russia, its new Moscow-based
joint airline venture, to cost up to Dollars 900m, Sir Colin Marshall, BA
chief executive, said yesterday.
The overall investment to set up the airline would include Dollars 100m in
equity, another Dollars 100m in construction costs for a new terminal at
Moscow's Domodedovo airport, and the balance in working capital and aircraft
funding.
BA will hold a 31 per cent stake in the venture with the remaining 69 per
cent held by Russian partners, including the international commercial
division of Aeroflot, the Domodedovo division of Aeroflot, and the Russian
Republican Innovation Fund.
Sir Colin, speaking at an FT aerospace conference in Berlin, said Air Russia
was expected to start operations in 1994, or possibly earlier.
The new venture would create about 1,000 jobs with no more than between 30
to 40 expatriate managers and training personnel, he added.
The airline plans to initially operate a fleet of seven jet aircraft, with
the Boeing 767 the most likely candidate.
Sir Colin said the project had survived the political turmoil following the
break-up of the Soviet Union last year.
The joint venture's newly-constituted board held its first meeting last
January in Moscow.
BA and its Russian partners plan to turn the proposed new terminal at
Domodedovo airport into the base of a new international East-West airline
hub.
The new airline would operate a network of flights from Moscow to western
Europe and North America and another to destinations in the Far East.
Sir Colin said the biggest current problem facing the new venture was a
regulatory one with the new airline requiring its operating licence and
specific route licences.

FT  12 JUN 92 / International Company News: In defence of voting
restrictions - The business of exploiting German company law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO-SAXON merchant banks are making a living in Germany defending what -
on their home patch - would be indefensible.
They are helping the management of large German companies fend off would-be
predators with the help of mechanisms which restrict shareholders' voting
rights.
Morgan Grenfell, the London-based merchant banking subsidiary of Deutsche
Bank, Germany's largest bank, is advising Continental, the German tyre
company, on how to defend itself against Pirelli as the Italian company
tries to remove voting restrictions at its German rival.
S. G. Warburg, another London-based investment bank, is advising the
Vorstand - management board - of Aachener und Munchener Beteiligungs (AMB),
one of Germany's largest insurance groups, on how best to deal with the
unwelcome attentions of Assurances Generales de France (AGF), the French
state-owned insurer.
Although AGF has built up a stake of over 25 per cent in the German group,
its voting rights are limited to just 8 per cent due to an arcane part of
German corporate law which allows the AMB Vorstand to decide whether
shareholders are entitled to vote. The Vorstand's decision not to register
AGF's 17 per cent block of shares was upheld last month by the Regional
Court of Aachen.
The battle over the restrictions at Continental will come to a head at a
shareholders' meeting on July 3, when, for the second year running, Pirelli
will attempt to remove a rule which restricts voting rights in the German
company to 5 per cent, no matter how big a shareholder's stake.
In March last year, Pirelli won a similar vote. However, the outcome of that
meeting was recently overturned by a Hanover court and the Italian company
has decided to launch a second challenge.
The rule is naturally irksome to Pirelli, as it owns 5 per cent of
Continental and has options over another 34 per cent. Merger talks between
the two companies broke down in December after 18 acrimonious months. It is
thought Pirelli would like to sell its shares for as much as possible, and
that the holding would be worth more without the voting restrictions.
Continental is not alone in having such a restriction, or
Stimmrechtsbeschrankung as it is known in Germany. A study conducted last
year by Bank Julius Bar, a Swiss bank, showed that at least 17 large German
companies have such a rule in place. Among these are Deutsche Bank;
Mannesmann, the engineering company; and BASF and Bayer, two of Germany's
big three chemicals groups.
The restrictions at AMB are different in that they leave it entirely to the
management to decide who should have a vote.
The other type of voting restrictions were granted to German companies by
their shareholders in the early to mid-1970s. The purpose was explicitly to
prevent Middle Eastern countries using the proceeds of high oil prices to
buy up German industry.
Some feel, however, that these restrictions are anachronistic. They are seen
as a way of making sure that German company directors lead comfortable
lives, undisturbed by the threat of takeover.
Morgan Grenfell and Warburg deny the rules being exploited by their clients
are primarily a management protection device.
'It is a method of preventing someone acquiring creeping control of the
company without having to pay a proper premium,' argues Mr Piers von Simson
of Warburg, referring to the so-called vinkulierte Namensaktien, special
shares whose votes can only be entered on the share register at management's
discretion.
Morgan Grenfell bases its defence on the argument that the restrictions are
in the interest of minority share-holders.
'The major problem with the German system from a minority shareholder's
point of view,' says Mr Jeremy Lucas of Morgan Grenfell, 'is that there are
no rules obliging a predator to extend an offer to all shareholders.
Minority shareholders are thus exposed to the danger of having an
undesirable and unworkable transaction forced on them by a 40 per cent
shareholder.'
These arguments are rejected by Pirelli and, more recently, Germany's
largest small shareholder organisation. 'Voting right restrictions in
general negatively influence the value of shares,' Pirelli said, and are
'therefore detrimental to the interests of all shareholders'.
The Dusseldorf-based Deutsche Schutzvereinigung fur Wertpapierbesitz (DSW),
with 10,000 small shareholder members, last week published an open letter to
the Continental Vorstand, arguing that restrictions acted against the
interest of minority shareholders. Shareholder ought to have votes in line
with their economic interest in a company.
The Julius Bar study says the best way to prevent an unwelcome takeover
comes not from voting restrictions, but from good business performance and
communications.
In the spirit of this, a few insurance companies have shed their vinkulierte
Namensaktien. In the meantime, however, German companies and their advisers
are making the most of these defences.
Mr Wolf-Dieter Baumgartl, chief executive of Aachener und Munchner
Beteiligungs, yesterday challenged Assurances Generales de France (AGF)  -
the big French state-owned insurance company which has amassed a 25 per
cent-plus stake in AMB - to come to the negotiating table.
He said that despite a war of words between the two companies, AMB was more
than willing to enter talks if the French company were ready to present
concrete proposals for co-operation.
However, AGF was not interested in real co-operation; instead it was engaged
in an 'increasingly open takeover attempt' designed to give AGF access to
the German insurance market, he said.
Under these circumstances, it was appropriate for the AMB management board
not to register voting rights attached to a large portion of the AGF stake.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CATER ALLEN Holdings, the discount house and financial services group,
reported profits up from Pounds 7.92m to Pounds 8.13m after tax and rebate
in the year to April 30.
The result was helped by the elimination of losses in gilt-edged securities
which the company pulled out of at the end of the previous period after
losses of Pounds 2.7m.
At the end of the year capital and disclosed reserves increased to Pounds
70.6m.
The discount house maintained profitable trading, particularly in
certificates of deposit, the Jersey and stock lending businesses had again
done well while Barclays Cater Allen, the new joint venture specialising in
international stock lending, came into profit before the year end.
However, the businesses at Lloyd's turned in a loss of Pounds 473,000,
against profits of Pounds 1.92m, when a flat result had been expected. There
were also losses in financial futures broking amounting to Pounds 88,000,
against profits of Pounds 65,000.
Cater did not expect an improvement at Lloyd's this year. In financial
broking the company expected to return to profit this year.
The proposed final dividend is raised to 20p making a total of 26p (25p).

OSBORNE &amp; LITTLE, the wallpaper and furnishing fabrics group, reported
pre-tax profits down by Pounds 37,000 to Pounds 855,000 in the year to March

Sir Peter Osborne, chairman, said turnover was slightly up at Pounds 19.1m
(Pounds 18.6m), with an increase in the second six months eliminating the
decrease in the first half.
However, the net operating profit margin had been affected by higher
distribution costs and an increase in royalties payable due to the
continuing growth in sales of the Nina Campbell brand.
Interest charges fell by Pounds 135,000 to Pounds 525,000. Gearing was
reduced from 153 per cent to 118 per cent.
Sir Peter said costs continued to be rigorously monitored and this had
resulted in lower stock levels.
Sir Peter said turnover for the first two months of the current year was
level with last year, and the group could only wait patiently for signs of
recovery.
Earnings per share came out at 7.83p (7.9p). The final dividend is
maintained at 2.35p for a same-again total of 4.35p.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bertam to purchase three more plantations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BERTAM Holdings has announced further acquisitions in line with its policy
of investing in plantation and development land in Malaysia, with a view to
participation in further schemes with Malaysian partners.
It has conditionally agreed to buy Sungkai Estates and Rembia Rubber from
Rowe Evans Investments for Pounds 4.27m cash, and Lendu Rubber Estates from
Lendu Holdings for some Pounds 1.37m cash.
Rowe Evans will use the proceeds to reduce borrowings and focus operations
and expansion in Indonesia, while Lendu intends to focus on agricultural
projects in Australia, particularly in relation to the 81 per cent
investment in Gubbagunyah, southern Queensland.
As Rowe Evans holds 33.65 per cent of Bertam, shareholder approval will be
needed; also the three acquisitions are conditional upon completion of the
disposal of 2,000 acres of Bertam to its joint venture company, expected by
the end of October.
For the time being all three estates will continue to be operated as
plantations. But Bertam intends to exploit the industrial development
potential of Rembia and Lendu, subject to relevant local regulatory
consents.
All three companies also announced results for 1991. Helped chiefly by the
firmer palm oil market, Bertam lifted pre-tax profit to Pounds 1m (Pounds
810,000) on turnover of Pounds 1.24m (Pounds 1.11m). Earnings per share were
3.09p (2.62p) and the dividend is 2.5p (2p).
Also resulting mainly from the oil palm market, Rowe Evans produced sales of
Pounds 3.93m (Pounds 3.49m) and pre-tax profit of Pounds 1.48m (Pounds
1.35m). Earnings per share slipped to 1.85p (2.05p) but the dividend is
again 1p.
There were recovery signs in wool and wheat markets for Lendu. Its turnover
rose to Pounds 525,000 (Pounds 408,000) and its pre-tax deficit was cut to
Pounds 65,000 (Pounds 138,000). Losses per share came to 0.39p (1.08p) and
the dividend is held at 0.3p.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In a year of reorganisation, pre-tax profits of James Cropper, the
Cumbria-based papermaking company, declined by Pounds 416,000.
After an exceptional charge of Pounds 131,000 relating to reorganisation
costs, pre-tax profits for the 12 months to end-March were Pounds 1.06m -
down from Pounds 1.5m. Turnover grew from Pounds 39.4m to Pounds 40.3m.
The financing costs of the new paper machine installed last year and an
increase in bad debts led to the decline.
Earnings fell to 8.6p (15p) and a final dividend of 2.025p raises the total
to 3p (2.9p).

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitions provide impetus for 33%
improvement at Blick
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLICK continued to buck recessionary trends in the six months to March 31,
lifting pre-tax profits by 33 per cent from Pounds 2.76m to Pounds 3.67m on
turnover ahead 37 per cent to Pounds 14.7m.
Mr Ian Scott-Gall, managing director of this clocking-in equipment and radio
pager supply company, said that most of the profits advance was
acquisition-led.
In May 1991 Blick added communal television and radio distribution and
controlled entry security systems to its businesses with the Pounds 8.26m
acquisition of Telefusion from Granada. And on April 29, it bought a
portfolio of rental contracts from GPT, which is jointly owned by GEC and
Siemens, for Pounds 3.8m cash.
Improved gross margins and tight cost controls had helped profits, said Mr
Alan Elliot, chairman, though lower interest rates reduced interest
receivable to Pounds 242,000 (Pounds 336,000).
Mr Scott-Gall said that the group was able to weather the economic downturn
because even though little new business had been won or few equipment sales
made, the maintainance and service side of the business had kicked in.
Telefusion had helped customer base income grow by 72 per cent and at the
period-end gross rentals receivable under contract had risen 30 per cent to
Pounds 67.5m (Pounds 51.9m).
Cash balances at March 31 - after the January/February invoicing period -
were up at Pounds 9.9m (Pounds 7.4m), boosted by the Pounds 3.7m share
placing in March.
Mr Scott-Gall described Blick's cash as part war chest - 'We're putting our
buying boots on again' - part cushion, part reinvestment capital and part
working capital.
The interim dividend is lifted 15 per cent to 3p, payable from earnings of
11.52p (9.49p) per share.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Salvesen pulls out of German distribution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIAN Salvesen, the distribution, manufacturing and specialist hire
group, yesterday reported a small increase to Pounds 67.2m in annual pre-tax
profit and announced the closure of most of its German distribution
businesses.
That operation lost nearly Pounds 1m in the year to March 31, compared with
a Pounds 1.4m profit previously.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 19.9m was included for closing warehouses
and redundancies to end a contract with Langnese Iglo, a frozen food
subsidiary of Unilever. This followed a Pounds 13m write-down of the assets
in the previous year's accounts.
Mr Chris Masters, chief executive, said the German distribution market was
the most unsophisticated in Europe. It was highly fragmented and lacked
purpose-built distribution centres.
The Pounds 67.2m pre-tax profit figure, compared with Pounds 66.6m in
1990-91, followed multiplied interest costs of Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 1.2m).
Net debt rose to Pounds 80.8m (Pounds 62.5m), gearing of 35 per cent, after
Pounds 100m of capital spending and acquisitions - this would fall below
Pounds 70m this year, Mr Masters said.
Distribution, which accounted for more than half the group's Pounds 484.3m
(Pounds 422.7m) turnover, increased trading profit by 20 per cent to Pounds
30.9m (Pounds 25.7m).
The German distribution operation was separated out as a discontinued
activity.
Specialist hire, notably the Aggreko generator and air conditioning rental
business, also grew strongly to Pounds 27m (Pounds 22.3m) trading profit on
sales of Pounds 111.7m (Pounds 82.4m).
In manufacturing, a small improvement in food processing, offset by a
decline at Salvesen brick left trading profit Pounds 1.5m lower at Pounds
16.6m.
Earnings per share rose to 17p (16.6p). A final dividend of 4.1p raises the
total to 7p (6.6p).
COMMENT
Although the German exit has proved expensive - albeit mostly below the
line, Salvesen gained credit for grasping what is hopefully the last of its
big nettles. None of the businesses that remains should get any worse - not
even bricks which has been a good damage limitation exercise - and some
should improve. Aggreko, in particular, has made the analysts smile because
of the entrepreneurial way the business has been taken from a UK/Netherlands
base to the US and Pacific rim. Distribution has great defensive qualities
and the French problem seems temporary. Lower capital spending should reduce
the flattening effect of interest costs. The one plus unlikely to be
repeated is a Pounds 1m exchange rate gain. A pre-tax profit forecast of
Pounds 73m gives a prospective multiple of 15 to 16. Its switch from food to
the higher-rated business services sector may generate some interest,
although the near doubling of the share price since August 1990 leaves
little scope for improvement.

charge. Earnings per share came to 14.3p (9.84p) and the interim dividend is
up 50 per cent to 3p.
Caravan manufacturing contributed Pounds 1.41m (Pounds 955,000) to profit,
reflecting increased share of the caravan holiday home market and improved
efficiency.
Pretty Legs Hosiery produced Pounds 530,000 (Pounds 392,000). Sales in the

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Fresh progress at Barbour Index
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Despite continuing difficult conditions in the construction industry,
Barbour Index, the specialist information supplier, reported growth in
annual turnover, profits and earnings.
Pre-tax profits for the 12 months to April 30 amounted to Pounds 3.7m
(Pounds 3.42m), from turnover of Pounds 11.9m (Pounds 10.9m).
The problems of the construction industry - the company's main market -
meant that microfile services to architects and planners were particularly
hard hit, although this had been more than offset by new services launched
for civil and structural engineers.
The relatively new health and safety microfiles showed substantial income
and profit growth with a renewal rate exceeding 90 per cent.
Three new services are due to be launched this year.
A proposed final dividend of 4.85p brings the total to 7.25p (6.6p), covered
twice by earnings of 14.8p (13.8p) per share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DRUMMOND Group finished the year to March 31 with a pre-tax profit of Pounds
1.14m, in line with the rights issue forecast made in January.
In the previous year there was a loss of Pounds 379,000 after exceptional
charges of Pounds 882,000.
Mr Stefan Simmonds, chairman, said despite a further year of recession
considerable progress was made in the development of the group.
It was now a broadly based inter-related fabric manufacturing group,
operating through five divisions.
All divisions contributed to a near doubling of the operating profit to
Pounds 2.03m, and there was continued improvement in the second half
performance. An increase in sales of 37 per cent to Pounds 48.4m primarily
stemmed from acquisitions made over the last 18 months.
Earnings per share came to 4.59p (losses 11.17p). The final dividend is
0.75p for a total of 1.5p, against 1p previously and 2.35p in 1990-91.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Strong northern performance restricts
Watson &amp; Philip fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WATSON &amp; Philip, the food wholesale and retail group which last year took
over Amalgamated Foods, yesterday announced a 1 per cent decline in interim
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.17m to Pounds 4.14m, in the 27 weeks to May
1.
The result was buoyed by a strong performance from Scotland and the north of
England. 'Between the north/south there has been a definite divide,' said Mr
Ian Macpherson, chairman. 'Every one of the northern businesses increased
profits and turnover, while I cannot say that about every one of the
southern businesses.'
Mr Macpherson added, however, that the group was beginning to see signs of
an upturn - albeit patchy - in the southern businesses.
The interim dividend is raised to 4.2p (4p). Earnings per share, depressed
by the 17.8m new shares following last year's rights issue and AF purchase,
fell from 9.3p to 8.2p.
Turnover rose by 9 per cent to Pounds 240.4m. Mr Macpherson said retail
margins had come under pressure, while the average spend in the group's 100
local convenience stores had fallen from Pounds 2.60 to Pounds 2.40.
Customers were cutting back on higher margin items, he added. 'People
continue to buy the same amount of cigarettes, but Johnny isn't getting his
crisps any more,' he stated.
The growing incidence of theft, which had risen as a proportion from 1 per
cent of retail sales to 1.5 per cent, sliced an estimated Pounds 465,000
from profits.
The trading contribution from retail services and stores fell from Pounds
3.1m to Pounds 2.8m.
Cash and carry increased profits by Pounds 342,000 to Pounds 1.43m,
following the closure of two 'unproductive' depots. Mr Macpherson warned,
however, that the improvement was not likely to be repeated in the second
half, with many customers affected by recession.
Margins in the catering business had actually strengthened because of a
greater proportion of W&amp;P's own brand sales. However, profits tumbled from
Pounds 266,000 to Pounds 53,000, after the Pounds 600,000 costs of expanding
this division.

The exceptional charge of Pounds 306,000 related to the departure of Mr

At the halfway stage the deficit was Pounds 251,000, compared with a profit

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Johnson Matthey static at Pounds 66m -
Rapid growth in EC catalytic converter market helps maintain profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JOHNSON MATTHEY, the precious metals company, yesterday surprised the market
with a small increase in profits as the European catalytic converter market
began to grow rapidly.
The company's rationalisation programme, which stripped Pounds 13m of costs
out last year, also helped pre-tax profits to rise from Pounds 66.1m to
Pounds 66.3m on sales marginally higher at Pounds 1.73bn.
Earnings per share rose 0.1p to 24p, but the company said that because of
the strong balance sheet and good prospects, it would pay a final dividend
of 6.65p, giving a total of 9.65p, up 4.3 per cent on the year.
Mr Richard Wakeling, chief executive, said that recession would have hit the
company much harder without the rationalisation programme, which was fully
provided for and had almost finished after two years.
Despite poor auto sales in the US and Europe, the catalytic systems division
increased operating profits by 28 per cent to Pounds 22.5m and is now the
largest contributor in the group.
Demand from European car makers in the last quarter was particularly strong
in the run up to the 1993 European Community emissions legislation that will
affect all cars.
The European market, where only 50 per cent of new cars are currently fitted
with catalytic converters, doubled last year and would almost double again
during Johnson Matthey's current financial year, Mr Wakeling said.
Furthermore, Johnson Matthey had increased its market share to about 35 per
cent.
Profits in the colour and print division rose 41 per cent to Pounds 11.1m,
as benefits of a rationalisation programme fed through rapidly. But precious
metals fell 23 per cent, as the prices of platinum and rhodium fell 13 per
cent and 24 per cent respectively during the year.
Likewise profits in the materials technology division fell 11 per cent to
Pounds 17.7m, with much of that profit coming from the biomedical area.
The company continued to reduce the amount of precious metal work in
progress, thereby releasing an exceptional gain of Pounds 6.4m, more than
covering the Pounds 5m exceptional cost of redundancies and rationalisation.
It also took a Pounds 4.4m extraordinary profit on the sale of 25 per cent
of Tanaka Matthey in Japan and a Pounds 4.8m extraordinary profit as a tax
credit on payments it made to Johnson Matthey Bankers seven years ago.
COMMENT
Finally Johnson Matthey is beginning to mine the rich seam deriving from
European Community vehicle emission controls. The sudden increase in
European demand for catalytic converters combines with JM's increasing
market share to suggest that growth and cash flow from this division could
be exciting over the next couple of years. Such rosy prospects are less
apparent elsewhere in the group. Colour and print, though more efficient, is
relatively mature and unlikely to change the group's direction; precious
metals continue to dance like a puppet in tune with the platinum price; and
with the exception of biomedical products, the materials technology division
is still in need of management attention. Catalytic converters will,
therefore, do the bulk of the work for shareholders and should help produce
pre-tax profits of Pounds 72m this year, or 26p of earnings, and a
prospective multiple at a justifiable 16.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Banks give NHL approval to restructure
Pounds 540m of debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL HOME Loans, the mortgage lender and financial services group which
recently came close to collapse, has won approval from its banks for the
restructuring of loans amounting to Pounds 540m.
The group is also preparing to renegotiate the terms of its international
bond issues with bond holders.
NHL's bank lenders agreed to give the company a 90-day waiver on its loans
last February after it emerged that the troubled mortgage lender was in
danger of breaching a 'material adverse change' covenant on its loans.
The 59 banks involved have now agreed to extend the maturity of NHL's debt
and turn the four existing loans into one large facility, lead managed by JP
Morgan.
'The pricing on the loan will have increased somewhat' said Mr Jonathan
Perry, chairman of NHL, but declined to provide further details of the
margins over the London interbank offered rate, or the fees. The
restructured debt will mature on December 31 1995.
The new facility replaces four separate loans: a Pounds 176m loan which fell
due earlier this month; a Pounds 231m loan which matures in February 1993; a
Dollars 90m loan which matures in June 1993; and a Dollars 135m letter of
credit which matures next month.
NHL's difficulties stem from the weakness in the housing market and from the
problems of National Mortgage Bank, a sister company.
Last July, a group of 10 banks agreed to put up a Pounds 200m cash life-boat
for NHL after local authorities began pulling deposits out of National
Mortgage Bank in the wake of the BCCI collapse.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cask ale boost as Eldridge Pope makes
Pounds 71,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GRAHAM DELLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELDRIDGE POPE, the Dorset-based brewer and wine shipper, yesterday took
another step towards full recovery with a return to the black at the interim
stage.
This USM-traded group, which incurred substantial losses on its hotel and
computing activities in 1990, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 71,000 for
the half-year to March 31, against losses last time of Pounds 118,000 which
took in a Pounds 320,000 interest provision against the Realstream computing
business.
The outcome was struck after an exceptional Pounds 77,000 (Pounds 130,000),
being its half share of losses on the Highcliff Hotel, Bournemouth, which
were partly offset by property sales surplus, and after an 18 per cent
reduction in interest charges.
Turnover rose to Pounds 20.2m (Pounds 18.2m) leading to a 20 per cent
advance to Pounds 1.24m in operating profits.
Mr Christopher Pope, chairman, said that the group's brands had performed
well with cask ales well to the fore with a 14 per cent sales upturn, mainly
from Hardy Country Bitter, reflecting wider free trade and wholesale
distribution. Wine sales advanced by 6 per cent in a difficult market, he
said.
After a nil tax charge, reflecting reliefs and allowances for the period
under review and previous years, earnings per 50p share emerged at 0.34p
(losses of 0.56p).
The interim dividend is raised 50 per cent to 1.31p (0.875p).
Mr Pope said the board intended to pay a gradually increasing proportion of
the total distribution at the final stage to reflect the seasonal flow of
profits and cash.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: National Grid meets forecasts with 32% rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL GRID Holding, the transmission company owned jointly by the English
and Welsh regional electricity companies, yesterday fulfilled expectations
to report a 32 per cent increase in profits.
Current cost pre-tax profits for the year to end-March rose from Pounds
237.8m to Pounds 314.5m on turnover which increased 15 per cent to Pounds
1.32bn.
The 12 regional electricity companies each own between 5.4 and 12.5 per cent
of National Grid Holding, which owns the National Grid Company. They will
receive total dividends of Pounds 117m, an increase of 12 per cent.
Mr David Jefferies, chairman, said revenues were boosted by the recovery of
a Pounds 47.6m shortfall in allocated transmission revenue in the previous
year in accordance with the price control formula operated by Offer, the
industry regulator.
However, operating costs had risen as the result of higher depreciation
charges, following the decision to replace some fixed assets before they had
completed their technical lives, and additional provisions arising from
reorganisation and restructuring of the business.
Capital expenditure increased by almost Pounds 90m to Pounds 363.1m, and was
expected to remain at a similar level over the next few years.
Net interest charges were Pounds 60.9m (Pounds 79m). Gearing fell from 63
per cent to 42 per cent.
Mr Jefferies said it was 'both significant and pleasing' that non-regulated
businesses, including generation, accounted for almost 20 per cent of
profits, up from 13 per cent the previous year.
Some savings had been achieved by a net reduction of 634 in the workforce,
to below 5,900. Staffing in the core transmission business was likely to
fall by another 10 per cent over the next two or three years.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Gascoigne sale nets Pounds 5.5m for Spurs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOTTENHAM HOTSPUR, the north London football club controlled by Mr Alan
Sugar and Mr Terry Venables, has received nearly Pounds 6m after completing
the sale of Paul Gascoigne to Lazio of Italy.
After paying about Pounds 300,000 to Newcastle United, Gascoigne's former
club, and other expenses, Tottenham will gain Pounds 5.5m.
This will give it net cash for the first time for some years. Debt peaked at
about Pounds 15m and the previous biggest con-tribution to its reduction was
a Pounds 7m rights issue announced in December and underwritten by Mr Sugar,
the chairman, who also heads Amstrad, the consumer electronics group.
Mr Colin Sandy, finance director, said the net cash achievement followed
expenditure of about Pounds 2.5m on players. However, a further Pounds 2m
remained to be paid in stages.
Apart from the Gascoigne sale, Tottenham's 1992-93 profits will benefit from
a new Pounds 1.9m three-year sponsorship contract with Holsten, the German
lager company. This roughly doubles the previous contract figure.
The Premier League's proposed television deal with BSkyB, the satellite
broadcaster, should bring in Pounds 1.5m, much more than the previous figure
for Football League matches. Amstrad distributes satellite dishes and Mr
Sugar has been a leading advocate of the BSkyB deal.
A further fillip will be provided by a 'duel' between Tottenham and Lazio.
Tottenham said yesterday that Mr Venables, chief executive, was negotiating
the television rights for the home and away games. TV fees and gate money
could total Pounds 500,000.
Tottenham returned to profit in the six months to November 30 with Pounds
810,000 pre-tax in a period that included most of the close season. Results
for the year to May 31 are expected to be announced in September.

MORLAND, the Thames Valley-based brewer fighting a hostile Pounds 104m bid,
yesterday attacked predator Greene King's investment record and marketing
strategy.
Sir Humphrey Prideaux, Morland chairman, also promised a forecast of pre-tax
profits, earnings per share and dividends for the year to September 1992.
Morland's advisers said the offer, which Greene King, the east Anglia-based
brewer, has made final, undervalued the company. 'A business of Morland's
quality deserves a much higher price than is on the table. They have closed
the door at far too low a level.'
Morland said that Greene King had lost large amounts of money investing in
leisure activities.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Scapa rises despite setbacks in UK and
North America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCAPA GROUP, the manufacturer of specialist products for the printing and
paper industries, yesterday announced a 5.6 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits, from Pounds 42.3m to Pounds 44.7m, in the year to March 31.
Mr David Dunn, finance director, said the increase came despite recession in
its main markets of the UK and North America. But Scapa was helped by
favourable exchange rate movements and contributions from new acquisitions.
Turnover increased 3.2 per cent to Pounds 300.2m (Pounds 290.9). Sales and
operating profits held firm in North America. But in the UK, where the
company is more exposed to the recession-hit automotive and chemical
industries, operating profits fell to Pounds 9.39m (Pounds 14.6m).
At the interim stage, Scapa increased pre-tax profits 2.5 per cent to Pounds
20.3m (Pounds 19.8m).
Net interest costs were Pounds 1.8m, down from Pounds 6.1m, helped by the
proceeds of last year's Pounds 55.6m rights issue. Net borrowings fell to
Pounds 44.3m (Pounds 57m) and gearing dropped to 22 per cent (31 per cent).
There was an extraordinary loss of Pounds 112,000 (profit Pounds 10.5m),
mainly due to business closures.
Earnings per share fell to 13.2p (15.2p), reflecting the higher number of
shares in issue after the rights issue.
The company is recommending a final dividend of 3.84p (3.65p) to make a
total of 5.36p (5.1p), a 5 per cent increase.
Mr Dunn said turnover in Europe should grow strongly this year following the
acquisition of Scandiafelt in Sweden, which was only completed in January.
In a full year, this company should add about Pounds 35m to sales, he said.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession continued to hit John Tams Group, the USM-traded earthenware
and bone china manufacturer. Over the 12 months to end-March, profits
slipped from Pounds 2.88m to Pounds 1.64m on turnover down just 3 per cent
at Pounds 19.8m.
Volumes were broadly maintained but margins were sacrificed, said Mr Gerald
Tams, chairman. Nevertheless, the outcome masked an improved second-half
performance, particularly in bone china.
The company acquired Royal Grafton just before the year-end, a move that
'opens new markets for us' Mr Tams said. It should add sales of some Pounds
3m in the current year.
Earnings per share fell to 4.92p (8.34p); a final dividend of 2.41p holds
the total at 4p.

FT  12 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Smith New Court doubles on strong equity
turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUOYANT TURNOVER in the UK equity market allowed Smith New Court, one of
London's leading marketmakers, to more than double profits last year.
Pre-tax profits for the year to April 24 amounted to Pounds 18.4m (Pounds
7.6m). Earnings per share advanced sharply to 23.4p (4.1p) basic and 16.6p
(8.8p) fully diluted. A proposed final dividend of 3.5p brings the total for
the year to 4.5p (3.5p).
Mr Michael Marks, chief executive, said the distribution reflected the
policy of paying 'a gently rising dividend' against the background of a
cyclical equity market.
After dividend payments of Pounds 5.4m (Pounds 5.1m), the group transferred
Pounds 5.7m (Pounds 2.7m) to reserves. Total reserves now stand at Pounds
11m.
The return on equity was about 20 per cent last year, against an average of
10 per cent for Stock Exchange member firms. Analysts estimated that Smith
takes about 20 per cent of UK equity marketmaking and 9 per cent of agency
broking business.
In 1991, return on equity was only 8 per cent, depressed by the low level of
equity market turnover around the time of the Gulf war. In 1990 the group
returned 13 per cent on equity.
An exceptional charge of Pounds 1.9m was taken to cover the cost of closing
the equity broking business in Australia which had operated for five years.
The group has no immediate plans to open new offices or close existing
operations.
Mr Marks said: 'A significant European presence is clearly needed in the
longer term and the client base will drive us towards this. Although I do
not rule out an acquisition in this area, we are more likely to grow
organically.'
The results excluded Pounds 10.7m paid by Citibank in March following a US
court ruling in favour of Smith over its purchase of shares in Ferranti
International Signal in 1989. Citibank has appealed against the award.
Mr Marks said Smith intended to 'vigorously defend the appeal', although the
process could take over a year. If a favourable ruling on the appeal is
achieved, the Pounds 10.7m plus interest will be taken into the profit and
loss account.

FT  12 JUN 92 / A slow sprint to the market: Why one survived where others
failed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When MFI's managers decided to buy the company out from an unhappy merger
with Asda the food retailer, in November 1987, they thought they were
leaving the starting blocks for a two-year sprint to the stock market.
By early 1989, talk was of a Pounds 1bn float that autumn which would give
investors in the Pounds 718m buy-out - including the directors and managers
 -a rapid and racy return. The 350 managers who had each invested between
Pounds 200 and Pounds 80,000 would share up to 26.25 per cent of the group's
equity if the flotation target was met.
But by late spring of 1989 sales growth was slowing, profit margins
slipping. Something was going wrong. By July MFI admitted it was missing its
profit targets. And in August the group agreed a refinancing with its
bankers involving a Pounds 35m rights issue and a deferral of Pounds 60m of
debt repayments.
The experience demonstrates that combining the high operational gearing of a
furniture retailer with the financial gearing of a buy-out can rapidly turn
from success to disaster.
MFI's survival when others, notably Lowndes Queensway, failed is a mark of
the management's efforts. There is wide acclaim for the team, headed by Mr
Derek Hunt, which has stuck together through thick and thin.
Mr Paul Deacon, retail analyst at Goldman Sachs, says: 'MFI is one of
Britain's outstanding retailers, and it all comes down to the management.'
Unlike Lowndes Queensway, the MFI team had run the group for some years
before the buy-out. Even so Mr Hunt readily admits that running a business
with Pounds 500m of debt through the worst recession since the 1930s has
taught him some lessons.
When the fall in sales first hit the group in 1989 it tried cutting its
prices, but soon found that did no good. People had just stopped buying.
After that gross margins were put up again and have been held throughout the
recession.
It also dawned on the group that the old system where stock was held in the
shop and customers took it away - on a roof rack borrowed from MFI if
necessary - could be replaced by an efficient delivery system so long as
customers could be assured of a delivery date.
Computer systems linking the shops to the factory and warehouse made that
possible, and also meant stocks could be slashed. Stocks have fallen from
Pounds 106.5m at the 1989 year-end to Pounds 69.6m in the latest balance
sheet.
'MFI is a very different animal from the one it was in 1987,' Mr Hunt says.
In spite of the recession it is a 'stronger, better organised business'.
Although the debt burden has pushed the group into losses, at the trading
level it has made profits through the recession.
In the four-and-a-half years since the buy-out, MFI has paid Pounds 260m in
interest and invested Pounds 250m. With its debt reduced from Pounds 500m to
Pounds 100m via the float, the group will immediately see a sharp rise in
pre-tax profits.
That should be followed, analysts hope, by a reversal of the gearing effect
which cut profits so savagely in the recession. A small improvement in sales
should bring a big rise in profits.
The managers who backed the buy-out have seen their original incentives
vanish. A new plan was agreed with the shareholders before serious work on
the flotation began. Under this scheme the managers will share an Pounds 11m
bonus. Good, but nothing like the original bonanza.

FT  12 JUN 92 / MFI publishes pathfinder prospectus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MFI, the furniture retailer which in 1987 was the subject of the largest
management buy-out then seen, yesterday published the pathfinder prospectus
for its planned reflotation.
It also reported results for the year to end-April. These showed trading
profits up 51.6 per cent to Pounds 73.7m and pre-tax profits of Pounds 8.8m
compared with losses of Pounds 24.2m. Sales rose by 3.8 per cent to Pounds
644.4m.
Had the float taken place before the year began, pre-tax profits would have
been Pounds 67.1m and earnings per share 7.5p. The prospectus promised a
progressive dividend policy.
It said 'the first half of 1992 has seen conflicting signs of a recovery in
consumer confidence'. The post-Christmas sales were strong.
In March and April sales rose more slowly, but since then they have been
broadly in line with the previous year.
The float, expected to value the group at about Pounds 750m compared with
the Pounds 718m buy-out, will raise Pounds 564m for the company, before
expenses.
The group will still have Pounds 100m of debt after the float, close to the
pro-forma Pounds 107.2m of shareholders' funds.
Some of the buy-out backers will sell their shares. Asda, the food retailer
from which the buy-out was made, is expected to sell the 25 per cent stake
it has held since then.
MFI has 11.4 per cent of the Pounds 5.15bn UK furniture market, making it
the leader in a fragmented industry. Its factories produce 60 per cent of
what it sells.
Under an incentive arrangement, Mr Derek Hunt, chairman and chief executive,
will receive Pounds 1.3m, six other directors will receive Pounds 1m each,
and one, Mr Trevor Tellett who joined the board in 1989, will get Pounds
215,000.
The directors have signed three-year service contracts, dated July 1.
Mr Hunt's salary will be Pounds 275,000 a year.
The issue will be priced on July 2, with applications closing on July 10,
and dealings starting on July 17. The basis of allocations will be announced
on July 16.
A quarter of the issue will be sold through a public offer, with 10 per cent
sold through financial intermediaries and the rest placed with institutions,
some in continental Europe.
County NatWest is sponsoring the issue and the brokers are Rowe &amp; Pitman and
Smith New Court.

<TEXT>
Pilkington's first dividend cut in its 22-year history as a public company
is a bleak comment on the outlook for its markets. It is hard to see when
the cut will restored. Profits this year may be no higher than last, even
without the burden of exceptionals. In that case, the dividend will again be
uncovered by earnings. Again, too, it looks like being paid not out of
operating cash flow but from disposals. It is in cruel contrast with
Pilkington's proud record of long-term investment that even a cut payment
has to be funded by the partial dissolution of the company. At yesterday's
129p, the shares are on 23 times historic earnings before exceptionals and
yield only 6.2 per cent. There seems nothing to stop them falling further.

FT  12 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Generators
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt unwittingly, the National Audit Office's report on the
privatisation of the electricity generators is as revealing as its narrow
conclusions are uncontroversial. It is difficult to dispute that the sale
mechanisms adopted by the Department of Energy were a success. In
particular, the institutional book-building process increased the sale
proceeds for taxpayers by several hundred million pounds. That helped offset
costs of Pounds 80m. Taxpayers did rather less well on the issue of the
companies' assets. While Pounds 110m of property was transferred out of the
generators to Nuclear Power, they were left with roughly Pounds 300m of
surplus property whose value was adjusted down by Pounds 74m ahead of the
sale. Those assets can be sold without penalty at the end of the decade.
Ahead of the sale, both generators successfully disputed the government's
profit and dividend forecasts. Had the government view prevailed, the
proceeds on a full sale might have been Pounds 350m higher. In the event,
the government lacked confidence in its ability to obtain a fair price.
Hence its decision to sell only 60 per cent of the shares. In view of the
subsequent rise in power prices, that was just as well.
Perhaps most importantly, the report recalls that the companies began by
demanding that they be sold with cash on their balance sheets, notionally to
pay for cleaning up their power station emissions. After 'prolonged
negotiations,' PowerGen capitulated completely and National Power accepted
Pounds 480m of debt, a figure within Pounds 50m of the government's original
position. The report neglects to mention the reason why the companies
reluctantly rolled over: during the dispute, minds were concentrated by the
suggestion that PowerGen would be sold to Hanson. Taxpayers have one less
reason to resent the latter's consummate avoidance of UK liabilities.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Ritblat may not have called the turn before in so many words. But
the Pounds 900m he has splashed out on properties since 1989 is an
indication that the British Land chairman had been expecting at least a
modest market recovery by now. Whether or not he was right yesterday to
predict that the worst is over, the important thing for shareholders is that
the company is well positioned to wait.
For one thing the profit and loss account looks in reasonable order, with
interest covered 1.3 times by net rents. There is, moreover, a Pounds 75m
unrealised surplus on trading properties to keep profits moving ahead in the
event of any tenant mishaps. The balance sheet, admittedly, is looking
stretched by the company's past standards with a gearing ratio of around 130
per cent if the convertible capital bonds are treated as borrowing. It is a
bit rich to exclude these for the purposes of calculating the ratio, then
point out that each 1 per cent increase in gross assets translates into a
2.6 per cent rise in net assets. That said, while British Land will not want
to push gearing higher than 150 per cent, it has ample facilities in place
and can always raise cash from disposals.
The question is how much further the net asset value has to fall. Its
overall 8.1 per cent running portfolio yield may be a full point lower than
Land Securities' and Great Portland's, but some would argue that this can be
explained by over-renting. British Land, moreover, looks to have written
down its City properties pretty savagely since 1989 by comparison with its
peers. At 215p the shares are not expensive, even assuming another modest
hit this year.

FT  12 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Everything flat at MFI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
As luck would have it, MFI's red herring prospectus coincided yesterday with
the May survey from the Confederation of British Industry, confirming that
the post-election boomlet in retail spending has indeed fizzled out.
According to the survey, furniture sales are down significantly from last
year. According to MFI, it is not quite as bad as that: sales growth is
merely non-existent, having been strong from Christmas to end-February and
weaker in March and April. Plainly, investors in the flotation are going to
have to take a good deal on trust.
But if they hold shares in the UK retail sector, they are taking a lot on
trust already. The average multiple for the sector is 18.4 times historic
earnings. Individual prices run from a conservative 14 times for Kingfisher
to a dotty 31 times for Next. It appears that however disillusioned
investors are with the outlook for consumer spending, they dare not be out
of the most obvious recovery sector. MFI on say 18 times earnings might be
overvalued, but no more so than the sector as a whole.
The case for a sector rating is familiar. On the one hand, MFI's business is
inherently volatile. On the other, a business which survived the last three
years with a crippling burden of debt can survive anything. There are the
usual caveats about a buy-out, such as the extent to which it was starved of
investment in the lean years. But it is claimed that capital expenditure in
the foreseeable future will not exceed depreciation and will be modest in
relation to cash flow.
A sector rating would imply a price of 138p and a value for the business of
Pounds 800m. That may not quite be attainable. But the flotation has only to
make a gross Pounds 564m to repay debt, giving a floor price of 97p on 13
times earnings. Anything beyond that is gravy for the management and its
backers, in the form of cash or of retained equity. Even in today's retail
climate, that leaves enough room for haggling to get the issue away.

<TEXT>
Sir, Your article 'Barlow Rand eyes Spanish target' (April 24), states that,
according to analysts, the decrease in sales of Spain's Caterpillar
distributor is mainly due to Komatsu's under-pricing policy in Spain.
The increase in Komatsu's sales in Spain in recent years is due not to
strategic price reduction, but to the quality of the product, service to
customers and a big marketing effort. We believe that to survive in the
earth moving equipment sector the highest quality of product and service
must be offered to customers.

FT  12 JUN 92 / The appliance of science in New York and London:
Disenchantment with the biotechnology sector has not stopped UK companies
coming to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The first in a wave of British biotechnology companies are trying to
transform their success in science to success in the stock market. Cantab
Pharmaceuticals of Cambridge and British Biotechnology of Oxford are now
under the investors' microscope, with traditional 'road shows' ahead of
their flotation.
Cantab has chosen a US quotation on Nasdaq, the over-the-counter share
market on which many American biotech stocks are traded. British Biotech is
hedging its bets with an international share offer, involving a listing on
the London Stock Exchange and on Nasdaq.
The whole UK biotech sector - comprising about 70 unquoted companies founded
over the past decade or so - is watching to see whether the pair can succeed
in spite of Wall Street's current disenchantment with biotechnology.
Investors in the US have grown impatient with the sector, as promised
returns from start-up companies have not yet materialised.
At least a dozen UK biotech companies will need to raise money through
public share offerings over the next two years, says Mr Louis Da Gama,
executive director of the UK BioIndustry Association. The fear is that they
may have missed the fund-raising opportunity taken by about 40 American
biotech companies, which have made initial public offerings over the past 18
months.
At the beginning of this year Cantab would have had little trouble
convincing US investors to put Dollars 20m into the company, which is
developing drugs to treat human immune system disorders. But having digested
an estimated Dollars 3bn in new shares from biotech companies over the past
year and absorbed unexpected bad news from some star performers, investors
are rapidly becoming disillusioned.
Since January, biotech stocks have fallen sharply relative to the market as
confidence has fallen. All new issues planned for this summer have been
shelved - except Cantab and British Biotech. Cantab put its sale on hold for
three weeks and then decided to go ahead, counting on its novelty value and
the strengths of its scientific links with Cambridge University to make the
flotation a success.
Dr Paul Haycock, Cantab chief executive, says the potential investors whom
he met in New York 'are interested in our access to a pool of excellence in
British science which is relatively unexploited compared to the US academic
world'.
British Biotech does not share this undiluted optimism, and has responded to
Wall Street's change of mood by 'shifting the emphasis more towards London
and away from the US', says Mr James Noble, finance director. The company
expects to raise at least Pounds 30m from the flotation.
Mr Noble points out that British Biotech, which has already raised Pounds
73m from four private share placements since 1986, has a longer track record
than most US biotechnology companies. It already has two drugs undergoing
early clinical trials and a third due to begin clinical testing in August.
'If we had been a US company we would probably have floated three years
ago,' he says.
The main reason why biotech companies need to go public is that they can
raise more money - for research and development - than is normally possible
with private placements. There is also pressure from the venture capital
funds, which finance companies in their early stages and want some of their
investment back.
'We eventually have to look for a position where liquidity is available,'
says Mr Jeremy Curnock Cook, director of Rothschild Asset Management, who
advises Biotechnology Investments Limited, the largest UK-based fund.
London Stock Exchange rules do not make it easy for biotech companies to
come to market. None can fulfil the requirement that a company seeking a
full quotation must have five years in profit.
The exchange does allow for exceptions. Eurotunnel, for example, not only
had no profits record but there was no prospect of profits until 2000. The
exchange invoked a rule that allows a flotation if it is satisfied that
potential investors have enough information on which to base a decision.
Although this arrangement has been applied to British Biotech and could be
applied to others, stock exchange officials are drawing up special rules to
make it easier for a biotech company to come to market. They are concerned
that UK companies such as Xenova, Agricultural Genetics and Pharmaceutical
Proteins will follow Cantab across the Atlantic when they need funds. Even
if biotech is out of fashion in New York, the Vancouver, Toronto and
Montreal exchanges in Canada are interested in listing UK companies, says Mr
Da Gama.
There are precedents for special listing rules in property and mineral
exploration, both of which require heavy investment before a return is
likely. However, it will take many months, maybe years, for London's new
biotech rules to come into effect. In the interim individual companies will
have to go through the laborious process of convincing the exchange of their
soundness.
Exchange rules are not the only reason why biotech has been absent from
London. Dr Haycock of Cantab says 'at the moment the US offers a vibrant,
dynamic market for biotechnology companies. It is an experienced market, for
example in terms of the number of analysts following the sector.' Cantab
will list in London 'when the market is more receptive to companies like
ours'.
US investors have been dazzled by the range of biotech companies on offer, a
few of which have become startling successes. Most notable is Amgen, which
will see sales this year close to Dollars 1bn, a 50-fold growth in seven
years.
There have also been some serious disappointments, such as the announcement
in April that the US Food and Drug Administration was not after all ready to
approve Centocor's much publicised antibody treatment for bacterial sepsis.
That setback not only demolished Centocor shares (now trading at Dollars 14
compared with a high of Dollars 59.75 in January) but also accelerated the
decline in the whole biotech sector.
While US investors have ridden a roller-coaster, UK biotech companies have
been conspicuous by their failure to generate excitement. Celltech, for
instance, the oldest and largest UK biotechnology company, made impressive
technical achievements during the 1980s - particularly in the large-scale
production of antibodies - but its commercial development was poorly
focused. As an uninspiring flagship for the UK industry, Celltech educated
fund managers out of the sector.
However, a restructuring in 1990-91, accompanied by new management, has
transformed Celltech's prospects. It is now a research-oriented
bio-pharmaceutical company, concentrating on three areas: immunity,
inflammation and oncology (cancer).
Celltech is burning cash more slowly than most other biotech companies -
partly because it has an income of Pounds 12m a year from manufacturing
antibodies for the pharmaceutical industry. Dr Peter Fellner, chief
executive, says it does not expect to float on the London stock exchange
until late 1993. It will then be looking to raise some Pounds 50m.
By then biotech could be fashionable in London. 'Things are going to change
suddenly after British Biotechnology,' said an industry observer. 'It will
place biotechnology in the spotlight in the UK.'

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, John Authers's interesting article on school fees funding ('Hard
arithmetic of school fees', June 6) attempts to assess value for money in
choosing a school and mentions several factors relevant to a school's
performance, including teaching quality and resources.
But he omits the most important: how academically selective a school is in
its pupil intake. That is unfortunate, since it leads him to make largely
spurious comparisons between highly selective day schools and boarding
schools, most of which have a broader intake.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Letter: Banks too 'trigger happy' about investigating
smaller companies in difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL PROUDLOCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, There appears to be an increasing tendency for banks to call for
investigative accountants' reports on smaller business customers with
trading difficulties. While, in some cases, this might be seen as prudent
banking practice, it gives cause for a number of concerns.
The first is that banks appear to be doing this as a matter of everyday
routine, rather than regarding it as an exceptional step. This is surprising
since, in many cases, the bank has been in a close relationship with the
business for a number of years and will already be very familiar with its
financial position. In such cases, an accountant's report will add very
little.
Next, these reports are generally undertaken by the insolvency
practitioners, who have a clear conflict of interest. If their report
suggests receivership as the only logical step to be taken by the banks, it
is standard practice for that same firm to be appointed as receiver.
Third, preparation of the report diverts the company's management just at
the time when it is most needed in the day-to-day running of the business.
Finally, the cost of these reports is borne by the customer, who is given no
chance to negotiate. In a number of recent instances which I have seen, the
charges levied seem to be out of all proportion to the workload involved.
This practice is becoming a source of increasing bitterness in the already
strained relationship between small businesses and their banks. To ease
this, a more constructive attitude needs to be taken by the banks and
accountancy firms themselves.
Banks should become less 'trigger happy' in calling for these reports. If
they feel they do not know enough about the businesses to which they are
lending money, they could perhaps spend a little more of their own time
getting to know their customers.
When reports are necessary, investigative accountants should be barred from
acting as receivers to the businesses they investigate. Finally, banks
should involve their customers in the negotiation of the fees for these
reports. After all, it is their money which is being spent.

(5)
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DONALD B BUTCHER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The eagerness with which the president of the Institute of Chartered
Accountants sets out the five actions which his institute intends to take as
a result of the Cadbury report (Letters, June 8) may have something to do
with the fact that four of them will no doubt lead directly to increased
fees for his members.
Your columns are remarkably empty of comments from shareholders, who will
pay for the additional auditing, as to what action they might take. This is
not surprising. First because Cadbury seems largely to have turned a blind
eye to the tiresome fact that somebody has to perform the ownership role and
second because action which shareholders take has to be paid for by
themselves. This is not the case for the other actors in this drama.
Private shareholders do intend to act. Some are in the process of forming
the UK Private Shareholders' Association.

Sir, Surely an attempt to repair the fractured interface between owners and
managers of businesses by interposing an additional layer (of non-executive
directors) must fail.
Two additions to company law may bridge the gap:
The remuneration of each executive director must be approved each year at
the annual general meeting;
Dividends may only be paid out of current cash earnings.
These would certainly ensure good attendance at AGMs and create awareness as
a first step to governance.

   From Mr EDMOND JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Owen Green and Sir Ronald Grierson (Letters, June 10) have rejected
the Cadbury report, but it is inevitably a curate's egg and corporate
governance a compromise.
Sir Owen describes 'ownership' of companies as 'novel, untested and
inappropriate'. But the basis of capitalism is a working system of ownership
rights, or we are nothing. Such privileges carry a positive ethic of duties
towards caring - eg, monitoring progress, voting on resolutions.
It is because institutional investors neglect these duties that calls for
non-executive directors are made.
Sir Owen is dead right on non-executive directors. The concept has an
oxymoronic ring, like 'lady mud-wrestlers'. But he cannot imply that
executive directors need no outside checks. Recent salary and share option
abuse, corporate over-stretch and collapse, all cry out for active
shareholder monitoring.
Sir Ronald knocks 'the absurdities of the Cadbury report', yet there are
nuggets in its veins that merit thought.

<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Owen Green has nailed the central weakness in the Cadbury report.
The introduction of any formula which may lead to a 'them and us' atmosphere
in the board room is to be deplored. Such a proposal, apart from the
dangerous risk of wasting time, also may result in damaging the vital link
between the executive and non-executive - that of trust.
If Sir Adrian Cadbury is concerned lest members of a board become united or,
heaven forbid, even friends, then he may take comfort from the fact that
most of us are more likely to seek to avoid letting down our friends than
our enemies.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Owen Green criticises the Cadbury Committee (Personal View, June 9)
for being long on accountability but short on drive and efficiency. In fact,
while greater accountability can and should enhance the performance of a
company, the Cadbury report actually fails to offer the reforms needed to
promote such accountability in practice.
Shareholders who attend company meetings know full well that these occasions
do not make any important decisions. Boards make little attempt to open the
company up to scrutiny, while chairmen's answers to questions are usually
highly subjective, suitably anodyne and anecdotal. As long as this absence
of scrutiny continues, criminal and unethical activity will flourish.
Sadly Cadbury does not go far enough and will only 'paper over the cracks'.
Simply asking shareholders to submit questions in advance will only add to
board control over the general meeting. Only a formal mechanism for allowing
shareholders to place resolutions, as in the US, can offer hope for changing
the climate so that they will believe they can monitor effectively. David

FT  12 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Chip trade war
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US is supposed to be in favour of the market economy and hostile to
'Japan Incorporated'. Judged, however, by the US-Japanese agreement on trade
in semi-conductors, the US is, in fact, against the market economy, but in
support of Japan Incorporated.
Naturally, that is not how the US-Japanese agreement to raise the share of
foreign companies in the Japanese chip market to 20 per cent is explained.
But how, other than as a violation of market principles, should pressure on
Japanese companies to respond to a political fiat be described? And how
might such an agreement be implemented, other than via a purchasing cartel
amongst Japanese semi-conductor users?
The US seems to want the Japanese economy to become the kind of centralised,
cartelised economy that many Americans complain it already is. But it is
not. The long term relationships characteristic of the Japanese economy are
not the exploitative cartels US industrialists complain they are. They are
often a sensible market response in an uncertain world.
The US-Japanese semi-conductor agreement, by contrast, does demand
cartelisation, if not outright economic planning. Nor is this merely a
crafty ploy to undermine Japanese economic strength. It is rather a way for
US industry to offset its own weaknesses.
The inevitable failure of an agreement whose fulfilment cannot be guaranteed
within a competitive economy increases complaints about Japanese bad faith,
thereby augmenting the tensions it is supposed to lower. The lesson of US
frustration with this accord is not that it should be implemented with
greater vigour; it is that the agreement should never have been made in the
first place.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Bark from the Tory pups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Danes, bless them, have put the fun back in British politics. One
account of last week's cabinet meeting concerns a junior minister at the
foreign office, Mr Douglas Hogg. He read out a paper that affirmed the
government's intention to proceed with ratification of the Maastricht
Treaty, when the time seems ripe. When he had finished, it is said, he
muttered darkly that he did not believe a word of it. This has been written
up in some of the newspapers as both a dastardly attack on the absent
foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd, and a daring charge by a supposed
centre-forward of the anti-Maastricht brigade, the self-same Mr Hogg.
Other accounts, from several of the grown-up ministers present, have it that
when a low-status outsider comes into the cabinet room he or she usually
sits in the most conspicuous seat, and reads from a departmentally prepared
brief. This sounds a bit like a child creeping shyly downstairs to a posh
dinner party, bearing an important telephone message. In Downing Street the
appearance of a comic junior like Mr Hogg can be an occasion of some
jollity. 'Hoggy,' one minister said, 'was just being Hoggy.' He was, I have
been trebly assured, simply adding a characteristic throwaway line. It helps
if you picture him in pyjamas and dressing gown, pouting slightly.
That pantomime was followed by this week's startling news that the secretary
for social security, Mr Peter Lilley, had publicly stated that he supported
the government's policy on Europe. He also supported Mr John Major. We were
simultaneously informed that Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the
Treasury, agreed with Mr Lilley. Always mindful of duty I thereupon asked a
number of other ministers whether they too planned to issue statements in
support of the prime minister. The light-hearted nature of the inquiry
seemed difficult for them to grasp. 'What - me?' was the common reply. 'My
loyalty has never been doubted.' Did that mean that Mr Lilley's was? 'No.'
What did it mean? 'It means,' said one senior minister, 'that inexperienced
puppies sometimes have to be slapped down.'
I would not describe either Mr Lilley or Mr Portillo thus. Both are known to
be strongly opposed to an accretion of power by a centralised Brussels
bureaucracy, but I have no reason to believe that either of them has been
disloyal. Neither seems to have had the slightest intention of resigning
from the government. What would they resign for? The cabinet does not
disagree with them. Neither Mr Major nor Mr Hurd has argued in favour of a
European superstate. The prime minister and the foreign secretary both
insist that the Maastricht Treaty represents a victory for the proponents of
free co-operation by national governments. Neither would contemplate putting
the bill to ratify it back before the Commons until it is certain that it
will get through.
The tricky question before Mr Major is: will that day ever come? The answer
depends on events beyond his control. If the Irish vote Maastricht down next
Thursday that will be the end of it. If they vote in favour we will await
the French referendum in the autumn. If they say yes, it is back to the
Danes. Meanwhile the bill will remain on the shelf. The prime minister, who
hugely enjoys the game of day-to-day politics, is not about to risk a
head-on clash with his own party, not if he knows he will lose.
All of this has enlivened the Conservatives' little Englanders, xenophobes,
anti-Europeans, unreconciled members of the Thatcherite Old Right, and Mr
Kenneth Baker. They put out scurrilous stories. They inspire mischievous
articles. They make unhelpful remarks. Long-winded and learned theses about
the biggest split among Conservatives since the last biggest split appear
almost daily. The cacophony is sufficient to wake the dead, although not
yet, it appears, the Labour party. There are faint stirrings, but the party
of Mr Neil Kinnock, soon to be that of Mr John Smith, has not yet
appreciated that these are promising times for an opposition.
The summer is therefore likely to belong to the Tory anti-Europeans. They
appear to believe that the Danes cut the rope, that the British Isles can
float away free from the European mainland. They have enjoyed many another
summer, until the logic of history and geography has obliged one government
or another to participate in whatever the continentals have been up to at
the time. The prime minister is aware of this. It is worth noting that at
the Earth Summit in Rio he has signed up along with the other Europeans. He
has not followed the United States in its opposition to the treaty on
biodiversity, as his predecessor might have done. Britain is of Europe and
cannot help but fall in with arrangements that suit others as well as
itself. Meanwhile we can enjoy the spectacle of the Tories at play. Some of
the lads can be rough, but they are always good for a laugh.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Southern discomfort: The industrialised and developing
worlds have failed again to find a basis for co-operation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Earth Summit, now drawing to its close, has a definite whiff of the
1970s about it. That, no doubt, is why the US is so visibly uncomfortable
there.
The 1970s was not a good decade for America. East-west issues became fuzzy
and north-south issues became sharp, with the US repeatedly cast as the
villain in the UN, while its European allies tended to criticise American
policy and suck up to Arab oil producers.
In the 1980s, America did much better, at least in its own eyes. First, the
east-west conflict resumed centre stage, with the US inevitably leading the
western side. Then the west emerged as clear victor. The glory of this
achievement carried over into the early 1990s. The Gulf war established the
US as incontestably the world's leading military power, and the driving
force of a revived United Nations. Some American commentators proclaimed the
arrival of a 'unipolar moment', in which international order would be
assured by the projection of American power.
That triumphalism has proved shortlived. Few Americans today seem to feel
that their country is uniquely successful or powerful. They are much more
preoccupied with economic, social and financial problems at home, and above
all with a perceived failure of their political leaders and the system that
produces them. How else can one explain the extraordinary popularity of Mr
Ross Perot, a man who deliberately eschews political platforms and bases his
appeal precisely on being unconnected with the established system?
But, as in the 1970s, their anxiety about their own failures and apparent
decline coincides with a reaction against their influence in the rest of the
world, and especially among the governments of the south who feel their
fragile sovereignty threatened by the combination of American power with the
appeal of America's individualist ideology. Even those with reasonable
democratic credentials, such as India, Malaysia and most Latin American
countries, feel distinctly nervous at the suggestion, widely canvassed in
the US and Europe since the end of the Gulf war, that humanitarian or human
rights considerations can override national sovereignty.
Few of today's southern regimes feel any ideological affinity with
communism. But many do regret the demise of the Soviet bloc which at least,
from their point of view, provided an element of balance in the
international system: a check on the otherwise unchallenged power of the US.
That, of course, is the biggest difference between the 1970s and the 1990s.
In the 1970s southern resentment against the US was egged on and supported
by the Soviet bloc. Today the south feels that it is on its own.
Not that 'the south' is a homogeneous political bloc, such as 'the east'
used to be. It has no common ideology beyond, at most, a general sense of
grievance about its inequality with the north. Nor are southern states
linked by any effective system of alliances. Many of them regard each other,
rather than the north, as their most dangerous adversaries. Even in its
heyday the Non-aligned Movement was never very cohesive, and today it is
rendered meaningless by the fact that there is no longer any alignment to
repudiate.
The Group of 77, which in the 1970s formulated the demands collectively
known as the 'new international economic order', was rather more successful;
and its reappearance is what gives the Earth Summit such a marked 1970s
flavour. Yet it no longer has the same impact, because the etatiste approach
with which it is associated has largely gone out of fashion, even within the
south. Almost all southern governments are now trying to apply 'northern'
economic policies on the domestic level, and many of them openly aspire to
join the north rather than beat it (although one should not forget that in
the 1970s Iran, for one, had precisely that ambition).
Above all, most southern states now accept that the global balance of power
offers them little or no hope of extracting significant concessions from the
north through confrontation. In the 1970s the oil crisis gave Third World
governments an increase in borrowing and bargaining power. It was widely
imagined that the cartel tactics of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries could be imitated by producers of other raw materials. But today
oil is as cheap in real terms as it has ever been, and other raw materials
have followed it more closely on the way down than on the way up.
Can the north's new-found interest in the global environment, and especially
in the preservation of natural resources such as the tropical rain forests
located in the south, provide an alternative basis for a bargain? That, in
essence, was the idea behind the Earth Summit, as its full title, UN
Conference on Environment and Development, suggests. Northern governments
accepted that the south could not be expected to take ecological demands
seriously unless its own agenda of economic development was addressed.
Tropical countries thought at last they had got something the north wanted,
and would be willing to pay for. As the Malaysian primary industries
minister, Lim Keng Yaik, says: 'I'm poor and need my forests to get on in
life, so if you want them you must pay - and give me technology and
investment.'
Yet it is clear now that no real bargain has been struck in Rio. Tropical
countries are not prepared to accept a legally binding forest convention,
seeing it as too great a sacrifice of sovereignty; and northern countries
are not prepared to pay anything much. Partly this is because of divisions
within each side. European countries, unlike the US, have signed the treaty
on biodiversity and have made it clear that they favour tougher limits on CO
emissions than the US is willing to accept. On the southern side oil
producers are sharply divided from other developing countries on the
proposed carbon tax and reduction of CO emissions.
Perhaps, if in the next few years the evidence for rapid global warming gets
more conclusive, the north will become more willing to pay for environmental
protection and a bargain will after all become possible. Yet it seems more
likely that the notion of a north-south bargain is in itself (to borrow a
phrase from US President George Bush) 'fundamentally flawed'. A bargain
implies a relationship of equality: each side has something to offer, and
something to expect. But the essence of the north-south relationship is
inequality. What differentiates the south from the north, in so far as the
categories mean anything, is precisely its lack of bargaining power.
Apart from oil and forests, what other assets might give the south the
leverage it needs to drive a bargain? Or, to put it another way, what else
about the south worries the north? The list is not difficult to compile:
weapons proliferation, terrorism, drugs, humanitarianism and sheer numbers.
The north worries that a southern state may acquire and use a nuclear
weapon, or fire a long-range missile at a northern country. It fears its
airliners may be blown up, or its citizens taken hostage. The north worries
about the cultivation and export of narcotic substances and dislikes the
thought of large numbers of human beings dying of hunger or being tortured,
massacred and driven from their homes. And the north also worries at the
thought that by 2025 industrialised countries will contain only 15 per cent
of a world population of 8bn people (whereas in 1950 they were 20 per cent
of 2.5bn).
'This growth,' according to former German chancellor Mr Helmut Schmidt,
'will inevitably lead to enormous mass migrations and therefore it will lead
to armed conflicts and it will lead to wars.' Exactly how this would happen
is not clear, but the spectre of ever more hungry faces pressed against the
window of the industrial world and looking in clearly disturbs the repose of
the privileged few who are looking out.
The trouble with all these issues, from the south's point of view, is that
they are problems for the south itself before they hit the north. Weapons
acquired by southern states are most likely to be used against other
southern states. Terrorism and narco-violence are already endemic in many
southern countries. Obviously famine, torture and massacre in the south are
worse for those directly affected than for those only troubled in their
distant consciences. And it is in the south that the burden of
overpopulation and mass migration, combined with and perpetuated by poverty,
is chiefly felt. If southern countries seek to frighten the north by
aggravating or refusing to solve these problems they are effectively
threatening to commit suicide.
Moreover, as they see it, most of these problems are the north's fault. The
north long ago destroyed its own deciduous forests. The north consumes far
more than its share of non-renewable resources, and is the main source of
industrial pollution. If southern farmers grow narcotic crops, and southern
cartels grow rich and powerful by exporting them, it is because the north
provides a ready market for those products while erecting barriers against
so many others. The north is also the main supplier of weapons and weapons
technology, whether conventional or unconventional. Northern colonialism can
even be blamed for some of the conflicts in the south which fuel both the
arms race and terrorism.
And the more southern countries seek to escalate these issues in the hope of
driving a bargain, the greater the risk that northern countries, and
especially the US, will resort to military action in an attempt to impose
solutions. Panama and the Gulf war could be prototypes for a series of
police actions to deal with Third World proliferators, drug barons and other
trouble-makers. Although no one really gains from such conflicts, it is
clear that the southern states on the receiving end are the ones that suffer
most.
If more constructive action is eventually taken to deal with these
north-south issues, it is unlikely to result from any crude bargain, but
only from each side deciding it is in its own interest to do something about
them, rather than sit back and blame the other for not doing enough. Of the
two, the north should be better placed to reach a set of conscious policy
choices, being by definition the richer, stronger and more sophisticated,
and also the more culturally homogeneous. Yet, looking at the present mood
of the US, one would hardly think so.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Leading Article: A case for police investigation
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A SYSTEM of grants and expenditure controls which fails to encourage the
efficient management of resources. Blurred lines of accountability. A
mismatch between financial and management responsibilities. The Audit
Commission's charge list offers ample justification for Mr Kenneth Clarke's
two reviews into the UK police, the second of which was announced on
Wednesday when the Home Secretary addressed the chief police officers'
conference.
As with other managerial reforms of public services, the driving force
behind the government's reviews will be economy and efficiency. The cost of
policing, which has risen almost 75 per cent in real terms since 1979, will
be a target for the Treasury in a tough public expenditure round.
But the issue of effectiveness is also central for a government which claims
law and order as its strong suit. Money has been poured into police
manpower, pay, support services and equipment in the 1980s. Yet levels of
recorded crime have doubled while the proportion cleared up has fallen.
Worse, public confidence in the police has declined, partly because of
well-publicised miscarriages of justice, partly because the service is not
seen as user-friendly. Without a relationship of trust, the flow of
information from the public dries up, depriving the police of a vital
resource in preventing crime and catching criminals.
In seeking to tackle these issues, Mr Clarke is pushing at a door which, if
not wide open, is at least ajar. Many senior police officers have recognised
the failings of the old ways and the need to rebuild public trust. Greater
flexibility in staffing and working patterns are being introduced. The most
go-ahead forces (now restyled police services) have adopted devolution of
management, policing by objectives and customer service initiatives well in
advance of the Citizen's Charter. Though they have yet to make an impact on
crime levels, there is evidence that these steps have begun to restore
confidence in the police.
However, intractable issues remain to be tackled by the Home Secretary's
reviews. The rank-based career structure has produced top-heavy management,
in which the best police officers are encouraged to become administrators.
Perverse incentives built into the financing system encourage the
recruitment of extra officers but discourage the substitution of cheaper
civilians where they can do the same job.
And there is a real problem of accountability in the present structure with
many police forces accountable either to joint boards or - in the case of
the Metropolitan Police - only to the Home Secretary. If the Local
Government Commission creates unitary local authorities based on smaller
districts rather than larger counties, the link between police authorities
and elected local politicians will be further attenuated.
Mr Clarke is well-placed to deal with such challenges. He has already pushed
through far-reaching reforms of the health and education services, in the
teeth of opposition from the professionals. In this instance, he has
attempted to carry along the police, with skilful speeches to the annual
conferences of the chief officers and the rank and file. Their co-operation
will be essential to the success of the solutions which his reviews devise,
and he is wise to take steps to keep them onside.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The EC-US soyabean war
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
US FRUSTRATION with the EC's behaviour over oilseed imports is
understandable. But it cannot justify the decision to retaliate by imposing
punitive tariffs on Dollars 1bn of farm imports from the EC, about a quarter
of the EC's farm trade with the US. Unpredictable political forces are at
play both in the US (the Perot factor) and in Europe (the Denmark factor).
Retaliation could even scupper hopes of progress in the Uruguay Round of
talks on world trade liberalisation and lead to escalation into wider trade
conflict.
The dispute over oilseeds has deep roots. In the 1970s the EC introduced a
system of subsidies that encouraged oilseed production, thereby undermining
a 1962 commitment to give soyabeans and soyameal from the US duty-free
access into EC markets.
Since 1987 the US has twice had its complaints upheld by dispute settlement
panels of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). EC efforts at
reform have satisfied neither the US nor, more significantly, the
international trading community.
Both impatient and cynical over EC delays, the US announced a month ago that
if the EC failed to reform its oilseeds regime, punitive tariffs would be
imposed on Dollars 1bn of EC farm exports. This it was entitled to do under
the Gatt.
Irrevocably weakened
EC officials argue that the US irrevocably weakened its position in the EC
when it embargoed soya exports in the mid-1970s during a domestic shortage.
This created concerns in Europe about security of supply and opened the gate
to Latin American producers. The US has been losing market share to such
low-cost producers ever since, a development that has nothing to do with the
new EC subsidy regime, argue EC officials.
Nevertheless, last week the EC responded to the pressure. Though continuing
to dispute the rulings, the EC agreed to compensate US exporters in
settlement of the dispute - an option open to the EC under Gatt rules, which
removes Gatt backing for US retaliation.
Clever ploy
EC officials presumably saw this as a clever ploy, but they may have failed
to reckon with 'the Perot factor' in the US. President Bush has won praise
from the soyabean lobby in the US for playing hardball with the EC. This is
important for him as he prepares to enter a three-man race for the
presidency, behind Ross Perot in many polls, and desperately needing to hold
on to the Republican base in Midwest farm states.
The danger is that President Bush will press ahead with unilateral
retaliation, disregarding the fact that he no longer has a Gatt sanction for
doing so. The EC would find it hard to resist a counter-attack. There would
then be little prospect of further progress towards a settlement of the
US-EC farm trade dispute that blocks successful conclusion of the Uruguay
Round.
Both sides have to move with great care, since far more is at stake than
soyabeans. The US has the discretion to play the dispute long. President
Bush can pause for up to 210 days before he imposes punitive tariffs. He
should do so.
Equally, the EC must now move swiftly in drawing up its compensation list.
The danger of conflict can also be defused by skilful choice of the goods on
the list: the more it comforts the US farm lobby, the better. And, should
the US now retaliate, the EC should hold back on counter-retaliation and,
instead, work even harder to settle the issue within the Uruguay Round.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Arts: Dejavu - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over 25 years on, John Osborne has done it again. Dejavu is not Look
Back in Anger, but it has every claim to become the most talked about play
in London. The only reservation apart from the length - a good three hours -
and the uncertainty about how to bring it to an end is whether you need to
know the earlier piece in order to enjoy the latter. My guess is that Dejavu
just about stands in its own right.
Osborne has forgotten nothing since the height of his powers. A quarter of a
century later, Jimmy Porter and Cliff are still there, relatively affluent
and with Jimmy tending to be known as JP. But instead of Alison, Jimmy's
wife, there is now Alison, his daughter, and instead of Helena, his wife's
friend, there is now Helena, the friend of his daughter. The rest of the
plot is much the same, right down to the use of the ironing board and the
switch of allegiance.
Apart from the sheer pleasure of seeing Look Back revisited, there are two
fundamental reasons why this production by Tony Palmer works so well. One is
that Osborne at his best is such a brilliant stage-writer: the words and the
allusions come tumbling out, joke after joke. The other is that this Jimmy
Porter - the ageing John Osborne in all but name - is played by the youngish
actor, Peter Egan.
This is crucial to the success. It means that even when JP is at his most
cantankerous and bilious, he still has a youthful charm. The danger of
playing him like a stereotype - angry young man turned reactionary fogey -
has been avoided. Although Egan appears to get through enormous quantities
of red wine and champagne in the course of the show, it never seems that it
is wholly the drink that is talking. This is Porter Senior reflecting on
Porter Junior: curiously enough he tends to the conclusion that the
generation of the 1950s had it better.
Jimmy looks younger than Cliff (Gareth Thomas), as perhaps he always was at
heart. What they still have in common, however, is the ability to turn on a
double act. The two man cabaret show is at the heart of their performance.
Where Osborne scores, just as he did in Look Back and also in The
Entertainer, is in mixing the corniest of old music hall jokes with the most
literary.
Some of the awfullest old lines are repeated, like 'my feet hurt' - 'why not
try washing your socks?' Then we are off with 'Auntie Wordsworth'. Osborne's
language is steeped in Shakespeare. Remember that team of comics, Jock and
Day, who stood tiptoe on the misty mountain top? This mock-literary stuff is
the preferred home of Jimmy and Cliff. They were, as one of them says in
Dejavu, camp before anyone knew what it meant.
There are also the Osborne swipes at fashionable trends. JP has become a
wine snob, and uses the language to dismiss the Nicaragua '89. In the
Osborne world there is now an A level in joined-up writing; for GCSEs you do
Elton John since nobody has heard of TS Eliot. The local shopping precinct
is called after Winnie Mandela. But the style is not repetitive because the
jokes are so infinitely varied.
There is a lot more besides. The Sunday papers are back: Osborne claims not
unfairly to have invented the category 'posh'. The bears and squirrels of
Look Back now appear regularly in the Valentine's Day messages in The Times.
If the earlier work was seminal, this is an essential catch-up.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Arts: The Master and Margarita
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is a theatrical version of Mikhail Bulgakov's novel, which in recent
years has swept literary Europe in many translations. Not long ago Andrew
Clements reported here on York Holler's operatic version, and it is not the
only one; the book seems to capture imaginations wholesale. Though The
Master and Margarita was Bulgakov's magnum opus, it was published only in
1966-67, a good quarter-century after his death.
The book is a long, wildly imaginative affair; what the Four Corners Theatre
Company offer at Hammersmith is tidy and concise, but seems to encapsulate
the peculiar charm and fantasy of the novel. 'Seems': having only dipped
into its pages, I can't answer for the faithfulness of David Graham-Young's
adaptation - but it stands beautifully on its own funny little feet. Though
we can guess that a thousand fanciful details must have been trimmed away,
the 17 scenes of the 'play' - more like a tale partly narrated, partly
illustrated in quirky vignettes - gleam with character.
While her writer-lover, 'The Master', languishes in an asylum, Margarita
encounters the Devil in Moscow. He is probably a real Devil, but quaintly
decadent, and he manipulates events as much toward benign ends as perverse
ones. Through him the characters of The Master's unfinished novel about
Pontius Pilate enter the action, and other mock-historical personages;
meanwhile Margarita places her fate in his hands, and he leads it through
curious byways to a metaphysical happy ending.
There are a lot of people involved, and the eight Four Corners actors play
them all with resourceful flair. Except with preconceptions from the
original Bulgakov, one could hardly imagine them more neatly realised, even
the least of them. Despite some cool murders and an accidental decapitation
everybody preserves an air of composed innocence, the better to set off the
magical strangeness of what goes on.
As adaptor and director, Graham-Young has ensured that not one line or move
fails to make an intuitive point. The prevailingly mild tone of the
proceedings is broken just once to brilliant effect, by a necrophilic,
Poe-flavoured ball in the Devil's apartments (gleefully choreographed by
Lynn Seymour to the waltz from Khachaturian's Masquerade). The effect of the
whole is pungent, delicate and elusive, engaging and oddly satisfying.

concerts

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Opera Festival - no longer 'International' in the umbrella title,
though still notably and imaginatively international in its concerns - is
again unfolding before the city's eyes and ears. It lasts until July 4, and
offers 25 different events in 12 different venues.
Many of these comprise adventurously out-of-the-way small-ensemble events in
theatres like The Place and the Riverside. Tuesday's opening concert had,
however, a distinctly old-fashioned air. It was a Grand Vocal Concert by two
leading singers, who offered a succession of items from the bel canto
repertory on the large stage and in the un-intimate acoustics of the
Barbican Hall. The hamfisted ineptitude of their pianist, who regularly fell
behind the beat as she struggled to turn the pages of her music, transported
one in a time-capsule back to the days when Voice Was All and laughably
unmusical accompaniments could be tolerated as being meant to go unnoticed.
Was such a display mounted for educational reasons, a sort of enacted
tableau of historical authenticity? If so it was a particular slight to the
tenor, Raul Gimenez, who (as he has shown in Royal Opera revivals of Rossini
and Donizetti operas) is a marvellously graceful and elegant singer of this
music, a stylist of the first order deserving of matchingly stylish support.
Even through the pianist's wrack and fog one could enjoy and admire his
softly moulded, sweetly coloured tones, the pliant delicacy of his phrasing,
his readiness to spin out both recitative and aria in such numbers as the
beautifully tender tenor romance from Rossini's Pietra del paragone.
The soprano - who came together with the tenor only in a single duet, from
Lucia, at concert's end - was 'historical' in a slightly less fastidious
fashion. Sumi Jo, recently Offenbach's Olympia, Donizetti's Adina and
Bellini's Elvira at Covent Garden, has a deliciously pearly instrument,
light and pure (though on this occasion a touch of edge marred its highest
notes). But she sounded here more like a teacher's best pupil than an
independent, fully formed artist; a feeling of carefully - mechanically? -
learned routine made itself felt in number after number, song or aria as may
be. Her pert singing of 'Una voce poco fa' added to the effect at once
comical and faintly depressing of the whole concert.
As winner of the 1991 Donatella Flick Conducting Competition, young
Constantine got to conduct the London Philharmonic on Tuesday. He has been
studying in St. Petersburg, and chose an all-Russian programme - to which
was added, late in the day, a Verdi scena for Montserrat Caballe. If the
quality of her mature soprano now rarely suggests a Desdemona, she made her
own mark by stately authority and grandly sculpted phrasing.
Constantine treated Verdi's extraordinary wind-writing in the Otello music
with loving care. For the pianist Nikolai Demidenko he honed Rakhmaninov's
orchestra in the 'Paganini' Rhapsody to a bright gleam, and made an alert
partner to his dazzling soloist. Not only is Demidenko a phenomenal
technician, but in this work he graded his attack to the music of the moment
with faultless instinct: here chords like axe-blows, there the pearliest
filigree - and everywhere, an exact grasp of the various relations in which
Rakhmaninov's piano here stands to the band.
About Tchaikovsky's Fantasy-Overture 'Romeo and Juliet' and Prokofiev's
Symphony no. 5, Constantine had his own definite ideas: never eccentric,
once in a while too overtly insistent. His platform-manner was assured and
direct. 'Romeo and Juliet' had been prepared with passionate care, as if to
rescue it from routine pop-status; indeed, he forced us to listen with
unusual attention, but achieved no great illusion of spontaneous flow.
In that piece, with its many repetitions, dwelling with unwonted, drawn-out
fervour on ultra-familiar passages was bound to sound self-conscious.
Something like that happened with the first movement of the Prokofiev too,
much of it taken (arguably) just under tempo: the result was magniloquent
and heavy, with none of the lithe spring that should carry it forward. The
rackety scherzo and the Adagio, convincingly quicker than usual, were much
better judged, and the Finale drove to a fine whooping close.
In all the main works there were small problems of balance. A grossly
prominent tuba regularly threatened to swallow its colleagues; over-eager
horns and light drums distracted the ear from the main musical burden; the
upper strings' pizzicati had too little Prokofievian sting to make
themselves felt. But definiteness of intention is a great thing, and
Constantine's shaping of the music was never short of it: this intelligent,
well-schooled conductor should mature fast.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Arts: Polish treasure - Fine art
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When young J-L. David was asked in 1780 by a rich, young Polish noble for a
portrait, he produced a masterpiece which marked him out as the equal of any
artist in Europe. 'Count Stanislaus Potocki' is a vast painting, no less
than three metres high, an achievement in the mould of Velasquez or Van
Dyck. Unquestionably, it is the jewel of an otherwise less than sparkling
exhibition, Treasures of a Polish King, which is now at the Dulwich Picture
Gallery.
Unless you caught Count Potocki's portrait at the great David show in Paris
in 1989, it is definitely worth trying to catch this appealing picture.
David's inspiration was to reinterpret the pomp and circumstance of the
equestrian portrait with its overtones of antique grandeur, for a
fashionable world which had also come to value effects of studied
informality.
With doffed hat the count courteously greets us, his audience. Every inch
the horseman, he sits rock-steady and needs barely to hold the reins, even
though his mount is clearly disconcerted by the dog (is it a Dalmatian?)
barking beneath its nose. The only touch of red in the canvas is on the
dog's collar, placed there to draw attention to the artist's signature. What
the photograph cannot convey is the gaiety of the colours. Yellow and white
predominate, with eye-catching turquoise for the count's silk sash, his
saddle, and the ribbons charmingly twined around his horse's ears and tail.
Normally, this portrait hangs in the Wilanow Museum in Warsaw, which the
cultivated Potocki himself founded. The exhibition itself is part of a
two-way traffic between Poland and the UK: thirty paintings, among them some
of Dulwich's most desirable, are now displayed in Warsaw. The idea for the
double-exhibition is a nice one, to commemorate the cultural ambitions of a
visionary Polish ruler, Stanislaus II Augustus.
The Dulwich connection comes about because he had two agents in England,
Noel Desenfans and Francis Bourgois, who put together a collection of
paintings for his beloved project, a national museum in Warsaw. It took them
five years and they lost their shirts on the venture; the king's abdication
in 1795 meant the collection stayed in England. It was bequeathed to Dulwich
College and in 1811, Sir John Soane's famous gallery was opened as the first
public art gallery in the land.
Adam Zamoyski's catalogue essay on Stanislav is a triumph, well worth Pounds
6.95. It evokes with real poignancy the rise and fall of this most attaching
of Enlightenment rulers. Never go to bed with a Russian, might be the moral
of his story. From being the adored lover of Catherine the Great, Stanislaus
became a Russian poodle forced to watch first the partition, and then the
extinction, of his country.
One day no doubt there will be a grand exhibition about Stanislaus, who
achieved things of enduring importance for Poland's self-image. However,
such a show lies in the future. With the exception of the David portrait,
the Dulwich show is distinctly low-key, and in my book a display of
embroidered sashes did nothing to cheer it up.
Admittedly, this is a chance to see a notable portrait by Mengs of Sir
Charles Hanbury Williams, the king's cultural guru, also two important views
by Bellotto, one of which was used for the reconstruction of Warsaw after
the Second World War, and a currently de-attributed Rembrandt portrait.
A paltry group of architectural drawings do not go far to convey Stanislav's
ambitions to build in a way which would symbolise the monarchy's, and
Poland's, resurgence. He imported Neo-Classicism into the royal palaces. It
is a pity there is only one drawing by the most distinguished of
Stanislaus's foreign proteges; Victor Louis, architect for Port-Royal in
Paris and the Grand Theatre in Bordeaux.
Not only budgetary problems but political difficulties dogged Stanislaus's
building ambitions. Here again, it is Zamoyski's contribution which is
memorable. It appears that among the king's many difficulties was the
existence of a wondrously daft 16th-century doctrine; Sarmatism.
The Polish nobility believed it was descended from the Sarmatians, a
barbarian tribe from the Black Sea who swept into Poland in the 6th century.
This pleasing doctrine took firm root - small wonder since it taught that
because the Polish peasantry were Slavs they were, quite literally, a race
apart from their masters.
Sarmatic sympathisers liked their architecture 'extravagant and fantastic'.
Perhaps it was to appease them that Merlini's delightfully silly elevation
for an Academy of Sciences married a pseudo-medieval crenellated tower to an
immense classical facade. I found this one of the more memorable things in
the exhibition; sad that Merlini was never able to build his hybrid.

Admit it, you have been thinking all week 'What we need is a music quiz with
really interesting guests such as Lucie Skeaping, Reg Presley and Kate
Copstick' haven't you? Well tonight your dream comes true: all three turn up
for The Music Game (8.30 C4). What more could anyone ask? Fridays will never
be the same again. Comedy freaks will have to tape the excellent American
series Cheers, though this is of course a repeat, at 9.00 (C4) while
watching the last in the present series of Rory Bremner on BBC1. When he
ends at 9.30 you replay the Cheers tape which takes you through to 10.00 and
the start of the topical quiz Have I Got News For You (BBC2), now
established as one of the week's funniest programmes. At 10.30 when that
ends you switch to C4 in time for the start of Clive Anderson Talks Back, a
chat show where the guests have more chance than with Dame Edna, but the
chairman takes a far more active part than, say, Michael Aspel.
Joel Bennett's Survival Special (8.00 ITV) makes the case for better
treatment of grizzly bears of which, it seems, there are 30,000 left in
Alaska and only 1,000 in all the rest of the USA.

Until quite recently hard disk drives were not only big, bulky and heavy,
but also sensitive to shocks which made them unsuitable for many hand-held
electronic devices.
Now Hewlett-Packard has introduced a shock-resistant mini hard disk, dubbed
the HP Kittyhawk Personal Storage Module (PSM). The Kittyhawk is a 1.3-inch
hard disk drive capable of storing 21 Mbytes of data in a device the size of
a matchbox.
Aimed at mobile applications like palmtop computers, electronic instruments,
communications and imaging devices, the PSM can withstand an operating shock
of 100g. Today's 1.8-inch and 2.5-inch disk drives can only handle shocks of
between 10g and 20g.
The drive incorporates an integrated circuit based on the same technology
used in cars to sense collisions and trigger air bags. As a result the PSM
can sense and brace for a shock before it occurs, keeping data safe.
The device will compete with solid-state technology storage devices like
flash memory, but cost only about a fifth as much. Hewlett-Packard: US, 208

Memory chips produced early in the next century will be able to store more
than 4bn bits of information - that's 250 times greater in storage capacity
than today's biggest chips.
The sweeping pace of miniaturisation, along with reductions in the cost of
computer power, has led IBM research scientists in Yorktown Heights, New
York, to build the world's smallest transistor.
Using electron-beam nanolithography fabrication techniques the chip's active
area measures just 1/75,000th of the cross section of a human hair.
Previously, the smallest transistor in existence was 20 times larger in

FT  12 JUN 92 / Technology: Wide-eyed at the view: A new type of television
is taking shape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you've just bought a new television set with a 36-inch square screen to
show off to the neighbours, you're out of luck. Consumer electronics
manufacturers say that the latest hot product is wide-screen TV. As the name
implies, it offers pictures that are much wider than deep.
Many European manufacturers, and the Japanese in their home market, have
introduced wide-screen TVs in the hope that the premium prices which the new
technology commands will boost their profits.
'This is the biggest step for television since colour was introduced,' says
Timo Ellila, TV product group manager of Nokia, the Finnish electronics
group.
Consumers, however, are being told that wide-screen TVs are desirable not
only because they are eye-catching and different, but because they are more
natural. 'Humans have a horizontally-oriented field of vision,' says
Philips, the Dutch electronics manufacturer.
Gravity also plays a part. Because it holds us to the surface of the Earth,
everyday activities usually take place along a horizontal plane.
Wide-screen makers also believe the shape of the screen will appeal to
viewers who enjoy the cinema, where the screens are generally wider than
high. They claim this type of screen offers more involvement for the
audience.
Whether or not wide-screen TV is really more natural or dynamic, there are
advantages to a wider format. For example, the wide screen is better suited
to transmitting films on to television. Given that films make up as much as
70 per cent of television output at peak periods, this is no small
advantage.
Television has had a roughly square-shaped screen for as long as it has been
in the home. The screen aspect ratio - the relationship between the width
and the height of the picture - has been 4:3. In other words, the screen
width of a conventional set is only 33 per cent more than its height.
By creating an aspect ratio of 16:9, wide-screen TV can be more faithful to
the original film. The wider aspect means that the width of the screen is
nearly 80 per cent greater than the height. The 16:9 ratio was chosen
because this is the most commonly used aspect in the cinema, according to
Philips.
The new technology will operate on the D2-Mac standard for satellite
broadcasts agreed by the EC. The standard is an interim stage in the move
towards full HDTV. It gives clearer pictures than the conventional Pal
standard used in Europe but is inferior to HDTV.
The main difference between D2-Mac and Pal is that while Pal transmits
colour, brightness and sound signals simultaneously from the broadcasting
centre to the TV set, the Mac system - both D2-Mac and HD-Mac for full
high-definition TV - transmits them sequentially.
The simultaneous broadcast of colour and brightness can cause complicated
patterns, such as tartans and checks, to become distorted. Mac broadcasts
overcome the interaction of these signals by transmitting them
consecutively, which provides clearer pictures. It does so by using advanced
digital technology called 'time division multiplexing'.
Wide-screen TV pictures also have more picture elements, or pixels, which
make them brighter and sharper. While today's TV pictures have 120,000
pixels, wide-screen TV pictures broadcast in D2-Mac will have about 180,000
pixels, or 50 per cent more. HDTV, meanwhile, will have about 700,000
pixels. Sound on D2-Mac broadcasts is digital, and the system is capable of
carrying eight soundtracks for every channel. This allows for multi-language
translations.
Manufacturers are confident that the wide-screen format will eventually
become the norm. The problem is that few programmes on TV are made to suit
the wide screen. In continental Europe there are about 10 channels
transmitting programmes in wide-screen style.
In the UK, BSkyB, the satellite broadcasting company, has been working on a
test wide-screen channel but has yet to announce when it will start
transmitting in the new format. Despite the spread of satellite TV most
viewers in Europe still receive conventional broadcasts, which use the Pal
system.
The Commission is committed to providing funds to encourage broadcasters to
switch over to D2-Mac. In the meantime, those who are eager to test the new
technology can buy a wide-screen TV and watch conventional 4:3 programmes.
Since the transmission will not fill the entire screen, black bars - which
now often appear when a film is broadcast on TV - will fill the sides of the
screen which are not used up.
To overcome the problem, manufacturers have introduced a 'movie expand'
feature which widens the picture until it fills the screen. This has
drawbacks too because it chops off part of the top and bottom of the
picture.
Another problem is that the wide format is only impressive if viewed on a
large screen. Manufacturers say they are unlikely to bring out sets below 24
inches in size, which means they will remain at the high end of the market.
Wide is beautiful not only on the screen but for amateur photographs as
well, judging from the popularity of cameras that shoot pictures several
times wider than are high.
Although first introduced about three years ago by Kodak as a disposable
camera, the wide-angle cameras have become so popular in Japan that
manufacturers have introduced compact cameras made specifically to take only
wide-angle pictures. Canon, Minolta, Olympus allhave their version of
wide-angle compact cameras, which are known in Japan as Panorama cameras.
The cameras use conventional 35mm film but the trick is to use a wide angle
lens and a masked film. Instead of filling up the whole film, a photograph
taken with a panorama camera uses just the centre half of the film by
masking parts of the top and bottom sections. Although a roll of 36 shots
will produce all 36 pictures the resultant negative will be smaller than a
conventional one.
The negatives are then printed on a wide photographiformat. But since they
need to be enlarged considerably the end product is fairly grainy.
Panorama cameras have become such a hit in Japan that camera manufacturers
have had to produce panorama adaptors that fit on to normal cameras to give
the same effect, says Jonathan Brandon at Canon UK. 'It looks very
impressive for landscapes.'

FT  12 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Debtors can claim for BCCI set-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MS FASHIONS LTD AND OTHERS v BANK OF CREDIT AND COMMERCE INTERNATIONAL SA
Court of Appeal (Lord Justice Woolf and Lord Justice Scott):
May 22 1992
JOINT DEBTORS under a charge to an insolvent company in liquidation can
proceed against it to ascertain whether the set-off of mutual debts as
between one of their number and the company under the Insolvency Rules is
effective to reduce their joint net liability.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by prospective
plaintiffs, MS Fashions Ltd, MS Fashions (Wholesale) Ltd and Mr Mohammed
Sarwar, from Mr Justice Millett's ex parte decision refusing them leave to
bring proceedings against the prospective defendants, Bank of Credit and
Commerce International SA and joint administrative receivers of the
companies appointed by BCCI under a debenture.
An appeal against the judge's refusal to restrain the receivers from
continuing in control of the companies' affairs and assets was dismissed.
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT said that since 1980 the two companies had been customers
of BCCI and had borrowing and overdraft facilities.
BCCI had taken security. Each company gave a debenture to BCCI, and
cross-guaranteed the other's debt.
In addition, security for the companies' debts was given by Mr Sarwar and
his brother by a charge of property in Leeds.
Under the charge the two companies and Mr Sarwar and his brother, defined
together as 'the principal debtor', covenanted with BCCI to pay 'all moneys
and liabilities . . . due, owing or incurred' by them to BCCI.
The effect was to render each of the four parties included within 'the
principal debtor' jointly liable for the monies and liabilities.
Mr Sarwar had some Pounds 300,000 on deposit with BCCI.
Under a letter of charge dated December 9 1985 he charged the sums standing
to his credit with payment of the companies' indebtedness to BCCI.
On July 5 1991 a provisional winding-up order was made against BCCI. On
November 12 it made demands for payment of the sums owed by the two
companies.
It demanded Pounds 135,981 against MS Fashions and Pounds 433,964 against
Wholesale. It demanded against each company the sum for which demand had
been made against the other company.
It demanded also that Mr Sarwar and his brother paid each of those amounts.
So there was a comprehensive demand against each of the potential debtors
for the total indebtedness owed by the two companies.
The effect of those demands was to transform what might previously have been
only a contingent debt into a present debt.
On January 14 1992 a winding-up order was made against BCCI.
BCCI was heavily insolvent. Those to whom it owed money could expect only a
dividend.
There was no defence available to the companies or Mr Sarwar in answer to
their obligation to pay the total Pounds 569,945 odd demanded by BCCI, save
under rule 4.90 of the Insolvency Rules 1986.
Rule 4.90 provided that where, before a company went into liquidation, there
had been mutual debts between it and a creditor claiming to prove in the
liquidation, 'the sums due from one party shall be set off against the sums
due from the other'.
Mr Driscoll for Mr Sarwar contended that the set-off operated as at date of
winding-up.
He said the effect of rule 4.90 was to diminish the debt owed by Mr Sarwar
to BCCI from the initial figure (Pounds 600,000 as a round sum) leaving him
as a debtor to BCCI in the net amount of Pounds 300,000.
It was contended that Pounds 300,000 was the only sum he owed to BCCI and
which the companies owed to BCCI.
On that footing the companies and Mr Sarwar desired to discharge the
indebtedness and redeem the debentures.
Mr Pascoe for BCCI contended that it was not open to the companies to take
advantage of the set-off.
It was not disputed that the effect of rule 4.90 was to reduce Mr Sarwar's
indebtedness but, it was said, the two companies remained indebted in the
full amount.
If that was so, BCCI was entitled to claim the full Pounds 600,000 from the
companies and then became accountable to Mr Sarwar for the Pounds 300,000.
But Mr Sarwar's recovery in respect of that sum would be limited to the
dividends payable in the liquidation.
Those contentions treated the operation of rule 4.90 as if it were a matter
of election by BCCI whether or not to invoke the set-off. BCCI could not be
required, it was said, to set off the Pounds 300,000 against the debt owed
by the companies.
That was the view that attracted Mr Justice Millett.
He said release or discharge of a surety did not discharge the principal
debtor, and it followed that BCCI could if it wished release the guarantee
and still enforce its security in full, notwithstanding that it had already
demanded payment from Mr Sarwar.
He said BCCI was not bound to release the surety. It might proceed in any
order it chose. It might enforce its security against the principal debtor
before seeking to enforce the guarantee for the balance, if any.
It was correct that release of a surety did not discharge a principal
debtor. Nothing but payment did that. Also, BCCI could, if it wished,
release the guarantee and still enforce its security against the companies.
But that was not the point.
It was plain enough that payment by the surety not only released the surety,
but also discharged or reduced the principal debtor's liability to the
creditor.
The set-off effect of rule 4.90 in reducing Mr Sarwar's liability
corresponded to payment of a corresponding amount made by Mr Sarwar to BCCI.
If that was the right analysis, operation of the set-off reduced to Pounds
300,000 the debt for which both the principal debtors, and the surety, Mr
Sarwar, were liable to BCCI.
Rule 4.90 could not properly operate unless it operated in reduction of the
debt owing to BCCI for which, at date of liquidation, the principal debtors
and the sureties were all liable.
If it did so operate, all that was left for BCCI whether against the
principal debtors or the sureties, was the balance of the original debt.
Leave should be granted to Mr Sarwar and the companies, to seek a
declaration that the amount of the debt which they owed BCCI had been
reduced by operation of rule 4.90 to the extent of the sum standing to Mr
Sarwar's credit in his deposit account with BCCI at the date BCCI went into
liquidation.
If on the hearing of the application BCCI or the receivers thought of other
arguments or found other authorities which invalidated the present
conclusions, it was open to them to employ them. His Lordship simply dealt
with the matter for the purpose of leave and on the basis of conclusions
which seemed at the moment to be impelling.
With regard to the application for an injunction to restrain the receivers
from acting in the receivership, though the court had not seen the
debentures under which they were appointed, it was common ground that even
if on the set-off point the companies and Mr Sarwar were correct, they owed
Pounds 300,000 to BCCI.
They had not paid. There could therefore be no challenge to the validity of
the receivers' appointment. The security held by BCCI entitled it, following
the demand for payment and in the absence of payment, to appoint receivers.
It was well-established that unless a mortgagor debtor had tendered the sum
owing to the mortgagee creditor, the mortgagee creditor remained entitled to
exercise whatever remedies the security provided.
The appeal against Mr Justice Millett's refusal of the injunction was
dismissed. the appeal against his refusal of leave to bring proceedings was
allowed.
LORD JUSTICE WOOLF gave a concurring judgment.
For Mr Sarwar and the companies: Michael Driscoll QC and Francis Tregear
(Zaiwalla &amp; Co).
For BCCI: Martin Pascoe (Lovell White Durrant).
For the receivers: David Marks (Dibb Lupton Broomhead &amp; Prior).

FT  12 JUN 92 / Management: When friendship proves to be all one way - How
to get more out of alliances with Japanese companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For virtually a decade, western companies have been hell-bent on making
'strategic alliances' with Japanese companies, often with ones which are
their rivals. For almost as long, they have been warned repeatedly by
consultants and academics that they are putting themselves at a potentially
lethal competitive disadvantage by allowing the Japanese to extract more
value from the relationship than they do themselves.
A few companies have paid heed. In the US, electronics manufacturers have
taken various steps to learn more from their Japanese partners; Motorola did
an unusually well-constructed deal with Toshiba in 1987 which benefited its
semiconductor memory business.
At the same time, these companies have protected their own core competences
 -such as Motorola's skill in microprocessor technology - more effectively
than in the past from being annexed by their Japanese partners. In Europe
there are signs that Philips has learned the same lesson.
But far too many western companies still see alliances in defensive terms -
merely as a way of filling short-term gaps in their product range.
Far too few emulate the Japanese in seeing them as an opportunity to extract
technology, marketing skills, or other kinds of learning from their partner.
The continuing gulf between attitudes to alliances among Japanese and most
western companies was all too evident from several papers presented this
week at an international academic conference on the globalisation of
Japanese enterprises.
Held at the Manchester Business School and organised by the North West
Centre for Japanese Studies, the conference was attended by a large audience
of leading Japanese, American and European academics, as well as business
executives.
There were few issues on which there was a consensus. But they did agree
that one of the west's fundamental problems is that learning from outsiders
is far less deeply rooted in western society and business than in Japan.
Hence the importance of the concept of 'organisational learning' which is
now sweeping American and European industry.
The point was put most forcefully by a professor from Auburn University,
Alabama. He declared that American companies quite simply fail to perceive
alliances as a form of learning. 'We don't understand the importance of the
technology we give up. Hence the generally one-way flow of it to the
Japanese.'
His comments were reinforced by a controversial study of electronics
industry alliances undertaken by a Manchester School of Management academic,
Fred Burton, together with a colleague from the University of Boston.
They looked at 208 alliances forged between 1978 and 1987 by seven top
Japanese companies, and concluded that the relationships were not working to
the advantage of western companies.
Not only was there very little east-west transfer of technology (as distinct
from components or products), but the Japanese companies were reluctant to
encourage such a flow.
As a result, complained Burton, western companies were becoming increasingly
dependent on the Japanese.
The latter, on the other hand, were reducing their dependence on western
partners, either by absorbing their skills, or by concluding temporary
alliances with several of them at once.
Given the emotive nature of the subject matter, it was fortunate that a
paper by a team of Japanese, rather than western, researchers gave the
conference the most searching exposition of the way Japanese companies use
alliances for what the academics called 'inter-organisational learning'.
They also redressed the balance somewhat by pointing to a handful of
alliances, especially in the semiconductor industry, where the benefits do
seem to be reciprocal. In particular, technology transfer is flowing at
least partly in the reverse direction, from Japan to the west.
In information technology, and especially in semiconductors, Japanese
companies see alliances as a way not only to make up for a company's lack of
technology, but also to help accelerate the development of whole new
industries, the researchers reported.
Outlining various levels of inter-organisational learning, they christened
one type 'strategic'. But one researcher said revealingly that this could
also be termed 'value appropriation' from the alliance to its parent
partners (or, presumably, to just one of them).
Even more important, the researchers added, is the experience of 'learning
how to learn' which companies can gain through alliances.
The daunting nature of their message for the west was pretty clear from
their brief verbal presentation at the conference. But anyone still in doubt
needed only to look at the penultimate paragraph of their written paper. It
read thus.
'The following words in (an) interview with an NEC director . . . pointed
out a new direction of alliances as inter-organisational learning:
'Alliances with AT&amp;T have led to large technological effects through
co-development with Bell Laboratories. Overlying the technological effects,
however, the most important effect that we could learn was how Bell
implements its research'.'
Quite so. It may already be too late to be worth saying this, but far more
western companies need to go out and do likewise.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Management: Grounds for optimism stir in Hungary - The
experience of one US consumer products group in eastern Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Robert Combee took over as head of Compack, Hungary's largest coffee
and tea company, he was ready for almost anything. But nothing had prepared
him for adventures in the skin trade. Hidden in Compack's balance sheet and
stored all over Hungary were huge piles of rotting animal skins.
They had been imported from Russia, apparently with some assistance from the
KGB, by the company's former accountants, who had hoped to make a quick
profit by turning them into fertiliser.
'There were thousands of tons of the things, and they stank like hell,'
Combee says. After the failure of several ingenious attempts to smuggle the
putrefying hides back into Russia, he eventually off-loaded them in Romania
and the Ukraine.
The bizarre and the unexpected have become routine for the fast-talking
47-year-old Dutchman since he arrived at Compack 15 months ago, shortly
after the company was acquired by Sara Lee, the US consumer products group.
His exploits, shared with seven expatriate colleagues of various
nationalities, are a vivid case study of the experiences - good and bad -
which can await western companies acquiring in central Europe.
Compack is a rare example of a central European company with a strong brand
identity. It also has a willing and hard-working staff of 1,300. In most
other respects, however, its business has had to be re-built from scratch.
'Things like job descriptions didn't exist, and there was no wage
structure,' says Combee. 'Though people in Hungary study marketing, what
counts is experience, and nobody here has it.'
Among the assets inherited from the past were large stocks of surplus tea
from Vietnam - the result of an earlier barter deal - and a vast tea-drying
machine. 'It was unbelievably complex and big enough to serve half of
Europe,' Combee says.
After clearing these out, he set about recruiting salesmen. Advertisements
were placed in the newspapers, but because the concept of selling was almost
wholly unknown in Hungary, they drew a very mixed response. Eventually a
40-member sales and merchandising team was assembled, many of them existing
Compack employees.
The next challenge was training. Since Combee speaks no Hungarian, his first
idea was to hire English-speaking local academics and get a western
specialist to teach them how to train.
But advertisements attracted only two candidates. 'The younger of them was
aged 85 and they both had Karl Marx University printed on their cards,' he
recalls.
Trainers were eventually found and today, Compack's fledgling sales force is
out on the streets in smart new vans. What they lack in experience, they
make up for in enthusiasm: one saleswoman who had difficulty meeting her
quota got her husband to help out at weekends.
Compack has also had to train its retail customers. Merchandising experts
have been drafted in from Douwe Egberts, Sara Lee's Dutch coffee subsidiary,
to instruct shopkeepers in basic techniques such as shelf management, stock
control and modern financial accounting.
Simultaneously, the company's product range is being re-launched, backed by
a television advertising campaign. Packaging has been re-designed to
incorporate the name of Douwe Egberts while retaining Compack's Omnia brand
name and its familiar coffee bean symbol.
The introduction of western marketing techniques has not gone altogether
smoothly, however. Compack's attempts to sell direct to retailers and to
increase prices have led to bruising confrontations with the Fuszerts, the
state-owned wholesalers which still control much of the grocery trade.
Combee hopes the problems will diminish as Hungary's growing numbers of
supermarkets set up their own warehouses and distribution systems.
However, the biggest headache has been a sharp fall in domestic coffee
sales, about 40 per cent of which have been replaced by smuggled imports.
These have been encouraged by a steep rise in duties and taxes which today
account for half the retail price of coffee in Hungary, making it among the
most expensive in Europe.
Compack recently secured a small reduction in taxes. However, with coffee
sales still in the doldrums, the company has been forced to make up the lost
revenues by expanding its other businesses.
In less than a year, it has launched and re-packaged about 50 items,
including new brands of tea, insecticides, a range of baby care products and
spices and mixes. 'I don't think you can find any western company which
introduced so many new products in such a short time,' says Combee. The new
lines, mostly imported from other Sara Lee subsidiaries, may be produced in
Hungary in future.
sales of about Ft1bn (Pounds 6.9m). Combee, who previously worked for
Heineken, the Dutch brewery, will not disclose profit figures. But he says
returns on investment are higher than at Heineken, though still below Sara
Lee's standards.
The focus now is on improving Compack's operating efficiency. Two of its six
factories have been closed, and the remaining plants are being reorganised
and automated.
Accounting systems are being modernised and an outside consultant is drawing
up formal job descriptions and wage structures.
One of the most positive surprises was the advanced state of Compack's
computing systems when it was acquired. Prevented by western export controls
from buying modern mainframe machines, the company's staff developed highly
sophisticated information systems based on personal computers.
But despite all this technical wizardry, Compack's productivity remains
handicapped by heavy over-manning at its head office in Budapest, which
employs more than 350 people. Combee says the numbers must fall
dramatically, though he aims to phase cuts in gradually to soften the impact
on morale.
For all the ups and downs of the past 15 months, he has no regrets. 'Why did
I do a job like this? It's the adventure. When I go into supermarkets and
see all those products which are my babies, I get very excited.'
However, what he calls the 'skins problem' and other unedifying discoveries
about Compack's affairs have left him decidedly cautious about further
acquisitions: 'If we saw an opportunity here which looked attractive, we
would think twice. Given our experience, we would be a lot more careful.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WIDE VARIATIONS in the unit costs of providing Youth Training and Employment
Training across England and Wales were indicated by a Labour party survey of
Training and Enterprise Councils, disclosed yesterday, Diane Summers writes.
The figures appeared to show that in Suffolk, for example, a YT place cost
Pounds 65.15 a week, while in South Glamorgan it cost Pounds 34.19.
The Department of Employment has been concerned in previous years about
these large differences in the cost of provision. Mr Patrick McLoughlin,
employment minister, said yesterday that these variations had in the past
'suggested we were paying some too much'. However, the department had
'negotiated hard' on unit prices this year.
Tecs themselves pointed to technical reasons for the variations, as well as
differences in local requirements. Mr Mike Bax, chief executive of Suffolk
Tec, said his was one of 11 areas involved in the government's pilot
training credits scheme, and extra money allocated for the pilot had been
incorporated within unit costs.
High travel costs in the large area covered by his Tec and a doubling of
unemployment over the past year had also pushed up costs, he said.
Department of Employment officials also suggested that some Tecs may have
excluded 25 per cent bonuses related to qualifications achieved by trainees.
Mr John Forsdyke, chief executive of Kent Tec, said his unit costs for YT
were nearer Pounds 50 when the bonus was added in, rather than the Pounds
36.59 shown for Kent in Labour's survey.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Limited Scottish growth predicted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND is likely to have relatively low rates of economic growth over the
next four years as North Sea oil output declines and the defence equipment
industry contracts.
This is the conclusion of a study of the Scottish economy by Mackay
Consultants, economic consultants based in northern Scotland.
The study says Scotland's gross domestic product fell last year in real
terms by 1.8 per cent to Pounds 44.4bn, which includes Pounds 5bn from
Scotland's share of UK oil and gas production.
If offshore oil and gas production is excluded from Scotland's GDP, as it is
in official figures, the study's GDP estimates are roughly in line with
those of the government. Excluding oil and gas, Mackay expects Scotland's
GDP to grow by 0.7 per cent in real terms this year, 2.4 per cent next year,
2.6 per cent in 1994 and 2.3 per cent in 1995.
If falling output of oil and gas is included, the expected growth in real
terms is 0.6 per cent this year, 1.8 per cent next year, 2.2 per cent in
1994 and 1.8 per cent in 1995. The consultants say their growth forecasts
for Scotland are below most forecasts for the UK economy over the same
period. They say offshore oil output will fall by 6.7 per cent over the
1991-95 period and spending on defence by 12 per cent.

CREDITORS of BCCI are likely to seek international government help to make
good their losses if the judgment to be given in the High Court today goes
against them.
The plan is being developed alongside a more aggressive stance being taken
by creditors over the past few days. They have been accused in the court
hearing of making their criticisms of the settlement 'too little, too late'.
The eight-strong creditors' committee argues that the Pounds 930m
compensation offer negotiated by Touche Ross, BCCI's liquidators, with the
government of Abu Dhabi, the majority shareholder, is insufficient.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Ruling today on BCCI pay-off
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DONALD NICHOLLS, the vice-chancellor, will rule in the High Court today
on whether the Pounds 930m settlement negotiated by liquidators of the
collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International can go ahead.
Touche Ross, the liquidators, are asking Sir Donald to give the go-ahead for
the deal to be offered to creditors.
The deal, which is estimated to give creditors a return of 30 per cent to 40
per cent, involves the injection of about Pounds 930m by the Abu Dhabi
authorities - the bank's majority shareholders.
The liquidators say that, if the deal was rejected, the only alternative
would be costly and risky litigation lasting to the end of the century.
A 7-1 majority of the BCCI UK creditors' committee has already voted to
recommend rejection and is opposing the liquidator's application for the
court to sanction the agreements.
The committee wants an amount equal to the Pounds 2.2bn promised by Abu
Dhabi in its unsuccessful attempt to persuade banking regulators not to
withdraw BCCI's banking licences last July. Some overseas creditors outside
the committee have given it their support.
Former bank staff are pressing for a four-month adjournment to give time for
the conclusions of the Bingham inquiry into the BCCI affair to be taken into
consid eration.
The liquidators argue that the deal offers creditors the only realistic
prospect of any worthwhile return this century.
In order to go ahead the package also needs approval from courts in
Luxembourg and the Cayman Islands at hearings later this month.

FT  12 JUN 92 / SFO defeats threat to powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office has defeated a High Court ruling that threatened to
limit its investigatory powers.
In an important judgment on the 'right to silence', five law Lords yesterday
upheld the SFO's claim that it has the legal right to continue questioning a
suspect about an offence after he or she is charged with it.
The Lords examined the exceptional powers, given to the SFO by parliament,
that remove from people questioned the right to silence.
The SFO had appealed against a ruling last November on a challenge to its
powers by Mr Wallace Duncan Smith, chairman of Wallace Smith Trust, who has
been charged with fraud involving at least Pounds 97m.
After Mr Smith had been charged and cautioned by the police that he was not
obliged to say anything, he was required by the SFO to answer questions
under section 2 of the 1987 Criminal Justice Act.
The section empowers the SFO to compel a person under investigation to
answer questions or produce documents, under penalty of up to six months in
jail, and/or a fine.
The High Court granted Mr Smith a declaration that before questioning a
person about an offence with which he has been charged the SFO must inform
him that he is not obliged to answer.
Yesterday Lord Mustill said Mr Smith had argued that an SFO investigation,
and therefore its compulsory powers, ended when a person was charged. That
proposition was impossible to sustain, Lord Mustill added. The act gave the
SFO the power to question about 'any matter relevant to the investigation'
and it was unreal to suggest that once a person had been charged there could
no longer be any such relevant matter.
Mr Smith had then argued that the 1987 act must be understood to preserve
the right to silence. But Lord Mustill said statutory interference with that
right was almost as old as the right itself.
The caution the police had to give was not directly linked to the right but
was a development relating to the admissibility of confessions, and once
that was recognised Mr Smith's argument fell away.
The appeal was not concerned with the admissibility at trial of responses to
SFO questions, or with ensuring the responses were voluntary, so there was
no reason to force on the act a qualification with which it had nothing to
do.
Mr George Staple, SFO director, said later that the judgment represented an
important clarification of the SFO's section 2 powers. 'It will enable us to
exercise these powers more widely than we have in the past due to the
uncertainty in the law.'
The whole issue of the right to silence is among the subjects being
considered by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice, which is due to
report next spring.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEO-CLASSICAL bureau plat made by Jean-Francois Leleu in Paris in the
early 1770s sold for Pounds 1.21m at Christie's in London yesterday.
It was part of the collection of Barbara Johnson, who married into the
American baby-powder family. She is selling some furniture to raise money
for commercial projects in her native Poland. In 1981 at Christie's she paid
Pounds 330,000 for the bureau, which carried an estimate yesterday of Pounds
750,000.
The furniture auction underlined the international demand for top-quality
items and raised Pounds 5.67m, with 18 per cent unsold. The Ashburton
cabinet, made by Pietro Piffetti, cabinet maker to the kings of Sardinia,
around 1765, sold for Pounds 770,000. It had been in the Ashburton family
since the mid 19th century but was only recently identified as the work of
the Italian master.
Another important piece from an English stately home, a Louis XV lacquer
commode, which had been at Luton Hoo, Bedfordshire, sold for Pounds 660,000.
A pair of tables stamped MA, the initials of Marie Antoinette, made Pounds
57,200. They were the work of Jean-Georges Robierscky and were probably
supplied to Marie Antoinette in the months after the start of the French
Revolution in 1789.
A Faberge imperial Easter egg, commissioned by Tsar Nicholas II for his wife
Tsarina Alexandra in 1905 to celebrate the birth of his heir, Alexei, sold
for Dollars 3.095m (Pounds 1.74m) at Sotheby's in New York on Wednesday. It
set an auction record for a Faberge egg.
In all, 54 imperial eggs were produced by the workshop of the St Petersburg
jeweller in the 30 years after 1885, but this is only the fifth to appear at
auction in the past 50 years. The last was sold in 1985 to Malcolm Forbes of
Forbes Magazine for Dollars 1.76m. The Forbes collection was one of the
largest of Faberge eggs and there was concern at Sotheby's that his death
last year had removed the biggest enthusiast. But an anonymous buyer has
filled the gap. The price was spot on the Sotheby's estimate.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE privatisation of National Power and PowerGen, the electricity
generators, was yesterday declared a success by the National Audit office,
the public-spending watchdog.
Sir John Bourn, head of the office, said in a report to parliament that in
spite of having to float the two companies during a period of market
uncertainty because of the Gulf crisis, the Department of Energy had
'introduced a number of innovations'.
The two companies, created out of the former Central Electricity Generating
Board, were floated in March last year. The report said the department had
largely achieved its aims of maximising net proceeds, increasing individual
share ownership and achieving a modest share premium.
The office praised the department's handling of the offer, particularly the
practice of obtaining indications of likely demand from institutions at
various prices. Taxpayers had also shared in the benefits of an upward
movement in the market during the offer period, thanks to a back-end tender,
where a proportion of shares were earmarked for offer to the highest bidders
among overseas and institutional investors after the close of the offer
period. This raised additional proceeds of Pounds 44.5m.
However, it said incentives offered to individuals may have represented
'less value for money' than in the earlier sale of the regional electricity
companies. The incentives, estimated to have cost Pounds 40.9m, were of the
same level as those in the previous sale, but had played a more limited
role.

FT  12 JUN 92 / IBM alleges counterfeiting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines, the world's largest computer manufacturer,
has extended to Europe its battle against companies that it claims are
counterfeiting vital components of its large computer systems.
Yesterday it started proceedings against Phoenix International (Computers),
the UK-based subsidiary of Phoenix Computer Associates of the US. It alleges
that Phoenix, a Surrey-based computer brokerage, sold memory cards - printed
circuit boards bearing memory chips - as genuine IBM products, when they
had, in fact, been reworked by a third party.
The action against Phoenix in the UK follows similar moves over the past few
months in the US against its parent and four other US companies. They are
Comdisco, one of the world's largest computer leasing companies, and three
engineering and broking companies - Datanon, Allen-Myland and BSM
Corporation.
IBM's claims against Phoenix allege trademark infringement and passing off
reworked memory cards as genuine. It is seeking an injunction, compensation
and costs.
Neither the managing director nor the finance director of Phoenix was
available for comment yesterday.
The issue of 'altered memory' is contentious in the computer industry
because of the large market for used IBM mainframe computers. This is worth
about Dollars 10bn (Pounds 5.4bn) in Europe alone.
Machines with altered memory cards can have lower values than those with
genuine IBM parts because of fears that substitute parts will be less
reliable and that IBM will refuse to service the computer.
IBM is offering, for a fee, to exchange other boards for guaranteed IBM
components.
The computer leasing industry, which depends on the ready availability of
used machines, has claimed that IBM is using the issue of altered memories
to control the second-hand market.
Mr Nick Temple, IBM (UK) chief executive yesterday denied such suggestions.
'We do not want to profit from this business but to help people out of their
difficulties,' he said.

FT  12 JUN 92 / The Ferranti Saga: Group sells its soul to save a shadow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FERRANTI International is a shadow of its former self. It has struggled on
since 1989 by selling bits of itself - including parts that were its pride
and soul.
Disposals, together with cuts in its remaining activities, have reduced it
to about 5,000 employees, less than a quarter of the workforce when the
International Signal and Control scandal broke. Turnover, which was then
about Pounds 1bn, is expected to have dropped to below Pounds 400m for the
year ended March 31. Ferranti shares, which in 1989 reached 113 1/2 p, have
traded this year in a range between 3 1/2 p and 13p.
Mr Eugene Anderson, the former Johnson Matthey chief executive who took over
as chairman in February 1990, is still trying to turn the company around. It
continues to make losses, although analysts expect 1991-1992 figures to
improve on the previous year's operating loss of Pounds 84m. The company's
debt, which in 1990-1991 was cut by almost two-thirds to less than Pounds
100m, is also expected to show a reduction.
Two years ago Ferranti obtained Pounds 47m from shareholders in an
underwritten rights issue. The next year it won Pounds 40m from auditors
Peat Marwick in settlement of a legal action arising out of its merger, in
1987, with ISC.
But principally it has had to resort to selling its assets - including, in
March 1990, its Edinburgh-based defence systems division, to its arch-rival
GEC.
In the division were Ferranti's airborne radar operations, dating back to
the Second World War and now including the project leadership for the radar
to equip the European Fighter Aircraft, along with other top Ferranti
defence products, from inertial navigation systems to night-vision goggles.
After contesting the Pounds 270m it paid in the deal, GEC has since also
taken over the missile-making activity which was a focus of Ferranti's
recent ambitions - based on one large and secretive contract, inherited from
ISC, to develop a sophisticated range of air-launched weapons for the United
Arab Emirates.
Other disposals include Ferranti's Italian offshoot and a half-share in its
naval sonar business, now a joint venture with Thomson-CSF. This has since
suffered a further setback with cancellation of one of its main projects for
Royal Navy diesel-electric submarines.
Ferranti's civil side - including industrial control systems for clients
such as oil companies and power generators and computer-based systems for
airports and emergency services - has increased proportionately, from about
25 per cent to 40 per cent of sales.
The Ferranti name also lives on in GEC Ferranti Defence Systems in
Edinburgh, although it is wholly owned by GEC. It remains the area's largest
manufacturing employer, but numbers have shrunk 30 per cent since Ferranti's
time to 4,800. A more rigorous regime is now in place.
'People still look at it as the old Ferranti firm,' says one senior manager.
'But it isn't any more.'

<TEXT>
IN two weeks a bespectacled 62-year-old former entrepreneur and local church
leader from the Amish farm country of southeastern Pennsylvania will
surrender at the gates of a minimum security prison and begin a 15-year
sentence.
Nearly three years after the discovery of an international arms trafficking
and financial fraud that crippled Ferranti, Mr James Guerin, the former
deputy chairman of the UK group, is finally going to jail. He was sentenced
on Wednesday evening by a US judge.
For Ferranti, Mr Guerin's incarceration is the end of a long nightmare that
saw the once proud defence company reduced to the role of a bit player in
the international arms market. For Britain, one of the main pillars of its
defence industry has crumbled.
For South Africa, which according to US prosecutors secretly offered asylum
to Mr Guerin and three other executives, the Ferranti affair is an acute
embarrassment. Relations between Pretoria and Washington have been further
strained by South Africa's refusal to respond to the US indictment of its
state-owned Armscorp, a weapons maker involved in the Guerin crimes.
For the US government, which permitted an adviser to President George Bush
to plead for clemency for Mr Guerin and to confirm his claims that he worked
with the Central Intelligence Agency in the 1970s, the sentence may come as
a relief.
The sentence cannot, of course, make good Ferranti's losses, stemming from
Dollars 1.14bn (Pounds 620m) of fraudulent arms contracts and Dollars 950m
of money laundering by International Signal &amp; Control (ISC), the
Pennsylvania company Mr Guerin sold to Ferranti for Dollars 670m in 1987.
The company estimates it lost Dollars 500m - including lost turnover and
overpayment for ISC. The loss to shareholders is hard to quantify.
Nor can the jail term alter the fact - according to US investigators - that
some of the US missile testing equipment and anti-aircraft radar systems
shipped illegally by Mr Guerin were ultimately used by Iraq against allied
forces during the Gulf war.
While the bulk of the fraud was perpetrated in the 1980s, it is ironic that
Mr Guerin used a New York dummy company, called Gamma, that US officials
acknowledge was set up in the 1970s in co-operation with the CIA and the
National Security Agency, the US electronic surveillance agency.
Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, chairman of President Bush's foreign intelligence
advisory board and a paid member of the proxy board of a Ferranti US
subsidiary that carries out classified government work, said on Mr Guerin's
behalf that he worked with Mr Guerin between 1975 and 1978. This work
involved the shipment by ISC - through Gamma - of military communications
equipment to South Africa which helped the CIA track South Africa's nuclear
weapons capability and monitor Soviet activities in the region.
US officials note that in a matter of such importance the CIA director would
have been well aware of Mr Guerin's activities. The CIA director during the
period of the most intense co-operation with Mr Guerin was Mr George Bush.
The CIA thus gave Mr Guerin the tools that, he claims, he later used without
official Washington approval.
Admiral Inman has termed Mr Guerin a patriot. But this week Mr Robert
Goldman, the chief US prosecutor, replied that Mr Guerin was merely 'a
self-annointed patriot'.
It remains unclear, however, why - as US law enforcement officials have
confirmed - the CIA did nothing to halt illegal ISC shipments to South
Africa between 1984 and 1989, despite the fact that the agency was
debriefing some of Mr Guerin's colleagues at the time.
The CIA has declined to comment, except to argue that it always co-operates
with the Department of Justice on matters relating to possible violations of
US law.
Investigators on both sides of the Atlantic were astounded at the
breathtaking scale of the financial fraud, which involved the creation of
hundreds of fake contract notes and invoices. Front companies were created,
including 38 Panamanian entities controlling 51 Swiss bank accounts.
From about 1981 ISC began fraudulently to inflate its sales and profits. By
the time its fraud was discovered in 1989 its operations were masking
Dollars 1.1bn of fictitious contracts. Ferranti has stated that as a result
its payment of Dollars 670m to acquire ISC was far too high.
Mr Guerin apparently exploited the gentlemanly approach of ISC's auditors
who were escorted on pre-arranged site visits to inspect inventory, or were
often simply lied to.
One senior investigator said: 'It was just like the betting operation
created in the film The Sting. There was one office in Greece which was a
hive of activity when it was visited by auditors. Two weeks later it was
empty. The whole charade had been created for the auditors' benefit.'
Some of the biggest fraud involved fake contracts with Pakistan, such as
Dollars 512.9m arranged under the codename KP. To persuade auditors of its
authenticity, Mr Guerin recruited Mr Talat Masood, a Pakistani general and
chairman of the Pakistan Ordnance Factory Board, to confirm the existence of
contracts.
Now Mr Guerin is on his way to prison. Yet several issues remain unresolved.
What will happen to the handful of other former Ferranti-ISC executives
facing sentencing? They have told prosecutors they thought they were
carrying out CIA-approved work and had reason to believe Mr Guerin's claims
of Washington sponsorship since they were debriefed by the CIA during the
1980s. The prosecutors say this is irrelevant.
Mr Guerin may be indicted again, this time in Florida, where US prosecutors
are finding links with Mr Carlos Cardoen, the Chilean arms maker who was
Iraq's biggest supplier of cluster bombs and factories. In the mid-1980s ISC
cluster bomb technology was transferred illegally to Mr Cardoen in Santiago.
A continuing Philadelphia investigation concerns bribes allegedly paid by Mr
Guerin to agents in Pakistan and in the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
In London, the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) has wound down its investigation
into the Ferranti affair. The UK end of the probe will remain technically
open until Mr Guerin's accomplices in the fraud are sentenced later this
year. But the possibility of any UK charges arising out of the scandal is
thought to be unlikely.

<TEXT>
RISING wholesale prices in the US last month have reopened the possibility
that inflation will revive, and have helped to dampen expectations of
further cuts in interest rates.
The Bureau of Labor Statistics said producer prices rose 0.4 per cent last
month, the sharpest rise in the past 18 months. The rise took the
year-on-year wholesale inflation rate from 0.9 per cent in April to 1.1 per
cent in May.
While this is still a low increase, it sounds a note of caution to those who
have been urging the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates further in order
to help along the faltering US recovery.
Advocates of a reduction in interest rates might otherwise have drawn
encouragement from the disappointingly weak level of retail sales last
month.
The Commerce Department said its advance estimates put May retail sales at
Dollars 158.8bn (Pounds 87.2bn), just 0.2 per cent higher than April's
Dollars 158.5bn - itself revised down from an earlier estimate.
Economists have been expecting indicators of consumption such as retail
sales to show slower growth in the second quarter than in the first, but
they had still hoped for a more robust performance than yesterday's
statistics indicate.
Some analysts, however, commented that the apparent surge in producer prices
presented little threat of a rise in inflation.
They pointed out that much of the rise could be attributed to increases last
month of 3 per cent in civilian aircraft prices and 7.3 per cent in tobacco
products.
But others noted that May's statistics showed the core inflation rate,
excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose to 2.8 per cent year on
year, after months of stability at 2.4 per cent.

FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Gatt warns Canada on growing US ties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING concentration of Canada's trade with the US reveals the risks as
well as advantages for Canada of the free trade pact between the two
countries, a Gatt report warns. The report on Canadian trade policies,
discussed by Gatt's governing council yesterday, says the US/Canada free
trade agreement (FTA) has boosted intra-industry trade, promoted investment,
encouraged new employment and abolished many protective rules. But it has
shown weaknesses in Canadian industry, a large chunk made up of small and
inefficient companies.
In the past two years, the US recession has hit Canada's manufacturing
strongholds, including the car industry, and contributed to bilateral trade
frictions, the report notes. In 1990, 72 per cent of Canada's trade was with
the US. The need to avoid over-reliance on US trade had underpinned Canada's
involvement in Gatt and the Uruguay Round. Canada sought a strengthened Gatt
framework to provide 'an external anchor' for regional integration, and to
ensure balance between participants.
Canada's recession had been aggravated by developments on world markets for
its traditional exports, including grains, timber and minerals. Canada's
grain farmers had been devastated by the US-EC subsidies war. Canadian
producers had been hit by the entry into world markets of metals exports
from the former Soviet Union and Eastern Europe, and world over-capacity in
forestry industries.
Gatt members yesterday welcomed Canadian moves to more trade liberalisation,
but criticised aspects of policy. They stressed the need for the FTA and the
future North American Free Trade Agreement to be trade-creating and
consistent with Gatt principles, noting that, in contrast to its push for a
more open trade regime for grains, Canada was trying to keep import curbs
for less competitive farm sectors.

FT  12 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Warning to Bonn on EFA decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE German aerospace industry is pressing for a decision this month on
Germany's participation in the four-nation Pounds 20bn European Fighter
Aircraft (EFA) project amid growing signs that Bonn could further delay a
decision on whether to pull out.
Mr Karl Dersch, president of the German aerospace industries association and
a member of the Deutsche Aerospace board, warned yesterday at a Financial
Times conference in Berlin of the dire consequences for German industry of a
withdrawal from EFA.
Criticising the political pressures threatening German participation in the
programme, he said: 'The European aerospace industry cannot live with a
policy driven constantly by election schedules and party politics in the
member countries, resulting in short-term and short-sighted populistic
ad-hoc decisions.'
He warned Germany could face 'another 1945 when all our scientists went away
either to the US or to Russia' if the country's aerospace industry did not
participate in EFA.
The lack of far-sighted policies risked not only destroying the defence
technology competence of an EC member country but also 'the entire structure
of European security and defence co-operation,' he said.
Deutsche Aerospace, part of the Daimler-Benz car group, has said it would
have to close at least two of its 14 domestic plants if Germany withdrew
from the EFA. Withdrawal would also threaten up to 10,000 jobs at Deutsche
Aerospace and another 10,000 jobs at German suppliers.
Mr Dersch and officials of the Dutch Fokker aircraft group said merger
negotiations between Fokker and Deutsche Aerospace were advancing.
Deutsche Aerospace, with Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy, is
bidding for 51 per cent of Fokker.

THAILAND'S business community and foreign investors yesterday welcomed the
surprise reappointment of Mr Anand Panyarachun, a businessmen and former
diplomat, as interim prime minister, but warned that the military were not
yet a spent force in Thai politics.
After weeks of gloom and uncertainty, the stock market rose 7.3 per cent on
the news, with the SET index rising 49.85 points to close at 737.23. Volume
was an exceptionally high Baht 11.56bn (Pounds 248m).
'The Anand move will certainly buy time,' said a foreign executive of one
multinational company.
Mr Olarn Chaipravat, senior executive vice-president of Siam Commercial
Bank, said he was 'extremely delighted. Now the country's economy will
survive'.
Mr Anand, who ran the country between the coup d'etat in February 1991 and
elections in March is expected to appoint a cabinet of technocrats and use
his four months in office before new elections to push through much-needed
infrastructure projects to relieve congestion in Thailand's transport and
communications networks.
General Suchinda Kraprayoon, the previous prime minister, was forced to
resign nearly three weeks ago after troops had killed dozens of
pro-democracy demonstrators, and the military establishment was further
humiliated when their latest candidate for the job, Air Chief Marshal
Somboon Rahong, was passed over in favour of Mr Anand at the last minute on
Wednesday as he was preparing to celebrate his elevation to the
premier-ship.
Few Thais believe that the armed forces would dare to intervene before the
new elections because Mr Anand's appointment was seen to be supported by
King Bhumipol Adulyadej, the influential constitutional monarch.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Iranian mullahs see first rumblings of discontent: The
country's citizens are still searching for the economic fruits of the
revolution
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRAVELLING west of Tehran on a featureless plain towards the Holy City of
Qom one's eye is caught by a huge gold-domed structure. On the roadside, as
you draw closer, battered signs extol the virtues of Iran's revolution and
the privilege of martyrdom.
'We shall stand firm until the last breath and last drop of blood, until we
erect the world of Allah,' reads one, among several, blood-drenched sayings
of Ayatollah Khomeini on display outside a large concrete and metal
structure like an aircraft hangar.
This is the shrine of Iran's late spiritual leader. With kebab shops near
its entrance, it is a place so tawdry and aspiritual that it is hard to
accept that it commemorates one of the more significant figures of the late
20th century. A young man who had come to pay his respects had a point when
he muttered: 'The old man deserved better than this.' On this, the third
anniversary of Khomeini's death, Iran stands uncertainly on the threshold of
a new era under the rule of President Hashemi Rafsanjani, known as a
liberaliser and risk-taker; but the new order seems fragile and so, too,
does a Tehran spring in which political constraints have been loosened.
Four-days of rioting last month in the holy city of Mashhad in the
north-east were a sign of serious disaffection, and followed disturbances in
other centres such as Shiraz, Arak and Tabriz. Not surprisingly, the
troubles have drawn calls for a tightening up.
In Mashhad rioters burned down the city hall, the main library and assaulted
revolutionary guards, the foot soldiers of the revolution, killing nine.
Ostensibly, the riots followed attempts to clear away shanty settlements
that have grown up around Iranian cities since the revolution, but it seems
there were deeper causes.
While the authorities, predictably, blamed 'foreigners, enemy agents and
opponents of the Islamic revolution,' and also hinted that hardliners routed
by supporters of Mr Rafsanjani in recent parliamentary elections had been
stirring up trouble, the disturbances were probably due more to deep-seated
anger over economic deprivation.
Judging by attitudes in the narrow streets of South Tehran, home to small
traders and the less well-off, the regime's popularity could hardly be
lower. Asked to comment on the fruits of the revolution, a shopkeeper named
Ali said it had 'brought nothing but corruption, the destruction of morale
especially among the young and widespread drug-taking.
'During the Shah's time,' he went on, drawing on a hubble-bubble pipe in a
small back-lane coffee house, 'policemen did provide a minimum of security.
Corruption did stop at a certain level. Now policemen come into my shop and
take goods on credit, but they never pay me. I have no reason to be
optimistic,' he added.
No conversation with an Iranian these days strays far from economic
concerns. The poor are becoming poorer, and the middle class, with the
exception of the privileged few, is being squeezed by soaring prices.
Salaries are barely sufficient to 'put bread on the table,' as one
longstanding acquaintance put it, and few can survive without working two or
even three jobs.
In his modern office, an elegantly-dressed Iranian businessman, speaking
almost perfectly accented English, noted down figures on a scratch pad which
showed, he said, Iran's truly desperate straits.
Earnings this year from oil, which accounts for about 90 per cent of
exports, will amount to about Dollars 12bn (Pounds 6.55bn) against estimated
requirements of about Dollars 30bn to keep Iran ticking over, let alone
taking care of the huge costs of reconstruction following the war with Iraq.
When the Shah left, Iran's population was 34m. Now it has nearly doubled.
Financing needs then were about Dollars 20bn.
'Frankly, we are in very bad shape,' the businessman declared. 'There is a
lack of foreign exchange. Financially, this is going to be a very bad year.
Fourteen years ago we had Dollars 28bn in reserves, we had diplomatic
relations with the entire world, our warehouses were full and our factories
were operating properly with new machinery.
'Now, there is no sign of the Dollars 28bn, 4m people have fled Iran, our
warehouses are empty and our factories are broken down. Morale is extremely
low, and there is bribery at all levels,' he said.
'There is no alternative to the rule of the mullahs,' he added. 'But the
only way out of the mess is for the government to be honest with the people
of Iran about the economic crisis, to release political prisoners, and to
give clemency to Iranians who return.'
Last month's troubles in Mashhad and other towns across Iran would seem to
carry a warning for President Rafsanjani: that unless he acts fast to deal
with the country's economic malaise he runs the risk of seeing his reform
efforts engulfed by popular unrest.
Iran has executed four people and condemned five more to death for rioting
in the southern city of Shiraz in a fierce crackdown on opponents of the
Islamic Republic, according to Irna, the Iranian news agency, Reuter
reports.  Irna did not say when the executions took place but its report
followed the hanging on Wednesday of four men who were convicted of taking
part in riots in the north-eastern holy city of Mashhad last month.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Japan's May trade surplus up 89% on previous year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S trade surplus continued to surge in May, rising 89 per cent from a
year earlier to Dollars 7.9bn (Pounds 4.3bn), and including the largest
year-on-year growth in the politically-sensitive US surplus since 1986.
The announcement of the surplus, which rose in seasonally adjusted terms
from Dollars 6.9bn in April to Dollars 9.7bn in May, follows hard on the
release of a controversial report condemning the US and European Community
for their unfair trade policies.
Japanese government officials indicated yesterday that they expect the rise
in the surplus to prompt renewed demands from other leading industrialised
nations for a commitment to stimulate the domestic economy.
A slowing of domestic demand and stirrings of recovery in foreign markets
led to a sharp 13.3 per cent fall in imports to Dollars 17.6bn and a 4.1 per
cent rise in exports to Dollars 25.5bn. The 51 per cent increase on the
year-earlier surplus was the largest since March 1986.
The decline in imports reflected weaker industrial demand for raw materials
and a slowing of consumer purchases of luxury goods.
Exports to the US rose 3.3 per cent to Dollars 7bn and imports from there
were down 16 per cent at Dollars 4.1bn, with the largest falls in imports of
raw materials, chemicals, metals and semiconductor equipment.
The country's trade with China continues to expand rapidly, with exports up
21.8 per cent and imports from China 12.6 per cent higher.
The finance ministry, which has consistently blamed the surging surplus on
'special factors', conceded yesterday that the slowing of the domestic
economy had blunted demand for imports, while external demand for Japanese
goods remained strong.
For example, car exports were 10.4 per cent higher, car components, most
destined for Japanese-run plants, were up 10.3 per cent, semiconductor
equipment showed a 10.7 per cent rise, in sharp contrast to the 18.4 per
cent fall in imports in semiconductor parts.
Stefan Wagstyl adds: A controversial bill to allow Japanese troops to serve
on United Nations peace-keeping missions yesterday completed another stage
of its turbulent passage through the Diet.
Amid protests from opposition parties, it was approved by a committee of the
Diet's lower house and referred to a full session of the chamber which will
be held today. The ruling Liberal Democratic Party hopes to take a vote as
early as today but the opposition social democratic and communist parties
have pledged to delay proceedings through filibustering.

FT  12 JUN 92 / Workers of the world unite with managers: The post-Soviet
industrial order
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FIRST visible sign of economic change in Russia has been the addition to
the cabinet in the past two weeks of three figures all drawn from the Soviet
industrial past. None comes with the label of rank conservative tied round
his neck.
However, they are all from 'industry': and the economic radicals around Mr
Yegor Gaidar - until this month the sole first deputy prime minister - have
in the first part of this year seen the industrial lobby as precisely the
force they must break. Now, far from being broken, that force is in the
cabinet.
One, Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, a former plant manager and deputy chairman of
parliament, has been put into the cabinet as a first deputy prime minister,
equal in status to Mr Gaidar; another, Mr Georgy Khizha, a former St
Petersburg defence plant manager and city adviser, is now a deputy premier;
the third, Mr Victor Chernomyrdin is now head of the vital energy sector -
and was the Soviet gas minister.
Mr Shumeiko is an often-professed supporter of reform, and Mr Khizha worked
with Mr Anatoly Chubais, the privatisation minister, on privatisation in St
Petersburg. The three ministers' presence there is proof of industry's
success in counter-attacking against the charge Mr Gaidar led against them.
At first demoralised by the effects of the price rises, the curbing of
credit and raising of interest rates, industry has since March used its
economic and political strength to increasingly good effect.
It has in Mr Arkady Volsky, the chairman of the Russian Union of
Industrialists and Entrepreneurs, the most adroit political survivor in
Russia - a man who, starting from a base as communist party secretary in
Moscow's Likhachev car plant, was able to turn himself from an adviser under
Andropov to a senior counsellor under Gorbachev, and most recently to a
post-Soviet industrial baron.
Mr Volsky has for the past three months steadily opposed the market
liberalism of the Gaidar government (while all the time performing his
continued attachment to reform in general) - claiming in an interview with
the trade union newspaper Rabochaya Tribuna on March 31 that production was
on the verge of unstoppable decline and hinting that - were policies not to
change - workers and managers together could paralyse the country with
industrial action. In the last two weeks, Mr Volsky and his colleagues have
formed a new political party, called 'Renewal' dedicated to the support of a
strong state and a viable industry - a further fragmentation of the
political scene, but likely to be the powerful fragment.
A union between managers and workers against the government well expresses
the realities of the post-Soviet industrial order. There is as yet no real
differentiation of interest: at the top, Mr Volsky can and does team up with
the trade union leadership to make vague but real threats: at plant level,
managers see themselves as slightly better paid members of the work
collective, with no experience of firing workers and no desire to do so. The
reaction of the managers to macroeconomic reform has not been to adapt at
the micro level by raising efficiency, cutting prices and staff. On the
contrary, encouraged by Mr Volsky and other influential leaders, it is to
blame the government for the nature of the reform, and to do nothing.
For these people, production has been and remains everything: they make
little distinction between tanks and pocket calculators. Yet, as Professor
Jeffrey Sachs, the government's main economic adviser, said on Monday: 'This
remains the great fallacy of socialist thinking; the idea that sheer
material output is all that counts. The services which make up 50 per cent
of the advanced countries' economies don't even get a mention.'
Mr Gaidar and his team are on Professor Sachs' side of the argument: indeed,
Mr Gaidar told Izvestia last week that he would not save bankrupt
enterprises from deserved oblivion. But even before he welcomed his new
colleagues to the cabinet table, he had been forced to make concessions.
An extra Rbs200bn has been promised to industry, and Rbs120bn to the oil
sector.
Energy prices will not be freed for some time, perhaps not this year.
Taxes are set to be lowered in the latter half of the year.
Money printing is being speeded up to meet the demand - backed by threats of
industrial action - from workers to be paid.
Privatisation has suffered long delays, most recently at the hands of
deputies who refuse to pass laws allowing privatisation and bankruptcies.
There is an argument, now being hopefully rehearsed by the international
financial community in Moscow, which puts an optimistic gloss on all of
this. It holds that the new ministers will soon see the unreality of their
early calls for tax cuts and extra credits: that Mr Gaidar remains the boss
under a still-committed president; and that Mr Georgy Matiukhin, the central
bank chairman whose resignation was rejected by parliament last week, has by
being confirmed in office strengthened the bank's position on high interest
rates and tight credit.
Against this, there is the view that holds that the salient opened up in the
cabinet by the industrialists have blunted the reform edge and that now, the
best that can be hoped for is a series of half measures.
No-one, not the most dedicated expert, has been able to discover what the
budget deficit is: they do not even know if the government knows. Thus, says
one: 'It could be any figure between nought and 20 per cent of GNP.' Most
Russians are convinced of the pessimistic option: the foreign experts here,
looking for the silver in the lining, try to believe the first. Neither can
know - for the main players themselves are locked in a struggle whose
outcome is of the first importance, but is unforeseeable.

SERBIAN irregulars yesterday finally allowed a United Nations convoy to
enter the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo in a move which could lead to
talks on the re-opening the airport and a resumption of food supplies to the
starving inhabitants.
The convoy left Belgrade, the Serbian capital, on Wednesday morning. But
that night it was forced to take refuge in a barracks on the outskirts of
the city after Serb forces prevented UN officials based in Sarajevo from
escorting it into the centre.
'Now that it (the convoy) has arrived, we have to try to demilitarise the
region around the airport which is held by Serb irregulars,' a senior UN
official said yesterday. He added that it would be 'extremely difficult' to
achieve this.
UN officials said there was a lull in the fighting around most of the city.
'But it can flare up at any time. We just have to keep talking and keep
negotiating so as to feed the starving people of Sarajevo,' a UN official
said. The arrival of the convoy coincided with fighting in Mostar, the
capital of Hercegovina, western Bosnia, where forces from Croatia yesterday
forced out Serb irregulars.
Zagreb and Belgrade radio reports confirmed that Croatian forces were
consolidating their grip on this swathe of territory.

PRESIDENT George Bush, saying that 'we're not the world's policeman',
yesterday sought to discourage speculation that the US was actively planning
military intervention in Yugoslavia.
In impromptu remarks before leaving for the Rio earth summit, Mr Bush said:
'We will do what we should do, but I'm not going into the fact of using US
troops.'
Expressing concern about the situation in Yugoslavia, he promised 'to
safeguard human life' and to work closely with the UN.
Yesterday the Washington Post had reported that the administration was now
reluctantly considering options whereby American troops could be used to
assist in humanitarian operations.
There has been some groundswell of support in Congress for action to stop
the slaughter. Senator Richard Lugar, the Indiana Republican, warned on
Wednesday that the time had come to 'draw the line' with respect to Serbia's
territorial ambitions, if necessary through co-ordinated military action by
the UN and/or Nato.

PROSPECTS for quick agreement on the formation of Italy's 51st post-war
government faded yesterday when it was announced that President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro would need more consultations with political leaders, writes Robert
Graham in Rome.
Mr Scalfaro began consultations last Thursday, hoping to be in a position to
ask someone to form a government by the end of this week. However, he has
found the parties in an unprecedented state of disarray, with none of their
leaders offering guidelines acceptable to others.
The president has to nominate a politician capable of mustering a
parliamentary majority in the unprecedented fragmentation of the legislature
following the April 5 general elections. Political commentators yesterday
said the field of potential candidates for the premiership remained wide
open.

<TEXT>
THE German government and the 16 federal states have reached virtual
deadlock in their negotiations to change the German constitution and clear
the way for ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.
The country which was the prime mover behind the drive for European
political union and for a single currency is now itself facing uncertainty
and long delays in its own ratification process, leading participants in the
negotiations said yesterday.
The issue at stake is how far the states will be given an effective veto
over any future transfer of sovereignty to the European Community, and how
far they will be given co-decision-making rights with the Bonn government on
EC legislation.
The demands of the 16 Lander have caused horror among other EC states,
fearing for a new level of prevarication and complication in EC
decision-making. They are also being resisted by the German Foreign Office
and the foreign policy establishment.
The fear is that no agreement will be reached in the negotiations before the
summer break, thus delaying the ratification process for the Maastricht
treaty. That in turn would give further opportunities for the
anti-Maastricht lobby to exploit an increasingly sceptical public opinion.
Mr Florian Gerster, European affairs minister for the Rhineland Palatinate,
said yesterday that the 16 states were in close agreement on their strategy,
and warned that if the government did not make further concessions, then the
whole ratification process for the EC treaty in Germany would be called into
question.
The main public concern over the EC treaty is the prospect of losing the
D-Mark in favour of a single European currency. On that issue the 16 states
are demanding that the steps to economic and monetary union (Emu) should not
be automatic.
However their main concern is to win more control over EC policies from the
central government, to compensate them for what they see as a steady drain
in their federal responsibilities in recent years.
The next opportunity for an agreement will be the meeting of the
constitutional committee of the Bundestag and Bundesrat, the two houses of
the German parliament, on June 25.
A working group bringing together the federal government and representatives
of the 16 states, has abandoned efforts to bridge the gap between them.
One of the main problems is that the government side cannot agree on a
common line.

<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS expects the development of Air Russia, its new Moscow-based
joint airline venture, to cost up to Dollars 900m, Sir Colin Marshall, BA
chief executive, disclosed yesterday.
The overall investment to set up the new airline would include Dollars 100m
in equity, another Dollars 100m in new terminal construction costs at
Moscow's Domodedovo airport, and the balance in working capital and aircraft
funding.
BA will hold a 31 per cent stake in the venture with the remaining 69 per
cent held by Russian partners including the international commercial
division of Aeroflot, the Domodedovo division of Aeroflot and the Russian
Republican Innovation Fund.
Sir Colin, speaking at an FT aerospace conference in Berlin, said that Air
Russia was expected to start operations in 1994 or possibly even earlier.
The new venture would create about 1,000 jobs.
The airline plans initially to operate a fleet of seven jet aircraft with
the Boeing 767 the most likely candidate.
Sir Colin said the project had survived the political turmoil following the
break-up of the Soviet Union last year. The joint venture's newly
constituted board held its first meeting last January in Moscow.
'I do not suppose that throughout the complex and colourful history of air
transport has an airline company been formed against a more extraordinary
background,' Sir Colin said.
BA and its Russian partners plan to make the proposed new terminal at
Domodedovo airport the base of an international east-west airline hub.
The new airline would operate flights from Moscow to western Europe, North
America and Asia. It could also eventually operate domestic routes in the
Commonwealth of Independent States.
Sir Colin said the biggest problem facing the venture was regulation.
'Russia and the other CIS states must regard the re-establishment of a sound
and stable organisational structure for civil aviation a priority,' Sir
Colin said.
This would require the devolution of Aeroflot, the former Soviet carrier,
and the creation of a comprehensive regulatory framework to encourage growth
and development.

MR JOHN MAJOR, UK prime minister, will be pledging British financial and
political support for action agreed at the Earth Summit here today.
He will state to the plenary session Britain's aid contribution to Third
World countries to help them overcome their global environmental problems.
He will also sign the bio-diversity treaty, which is one of the key
documents emanating from the conference.
Mr Major will use his 36 hours in Rio for bilateral meetings with other
political leaders. These include President Daniel arap Moi of Kenya, Mr
Albert Reynolds, the Irish prime minister and Li Peng, the Chinese prime
minister, with whom he will discuss Hong Kong.
Mr Major said the summit demonstrated two things: 'The importance of the
occasion and the fact that so many nations are prepared to come together,
often swallowing their own domestic national interests, to try and reach an
agreement on matters of importance to the environment.'
Mr Major, who has pledged to sign all the summit conventions, said he
understood reservations expressed by the US, which has been criticised for
refusing to accept a commitment to binding targets for development.
'I realise that some people would like to go further. But this conference is
quite unique, 100 nations here seeking to reach agreement. It was never
going to be easy.'

<TEXT>
MR Oskar Lafontaine, deputy leader of Germany's opposition Social Democrats
(SPD) and premier of the Saarland, yesterday survived a vote of no
confidence in his state parliament by 29 votes to 21.
He had rejected charges of self-enrichment, for claiming a full pension as
former mayor of Saarbrucken from the age of 42, on top of his ministerial
salary, as a 'dirty smear campaign.'
The Saarland assembly split on straight party lines, with all the SPD
members backing their leader, but the affair has left Mr Lafontaine, who was
candidate for German chancellor in 1990, with his national reputation in
tatters.
The other result has been an upsurge in public interest in all the perks,
pensions and privileges of their politicians, and calls for an independent
inquiry into salaries in the Bundestag in Bonn.

THE Paris government yesterday voiced concern over US resistance to the

group, by Thomson-CSF, the French state controlled defence electronics
company, writes William Dawkins in Paris.
Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, said he hoped that US desires to
protect strategic military independence would not be used 'as a pretext to
hamper an operation of industrial value for the companies concerned and for
the American economy'. This is the first official sign of French anxiety
over a potential irritant to relations with the US. A New York bankruptcy
court two months ago accepted a Dollars 450m for LTV's missiles and aircraft
divisions from Thomson-CSF and the Carlyle Group, a US merchant bank.
Later, the committee of foreign investment in the US opened an inquiry on
the security implications, after the deal was criticised in Congress.

<TEXT>
PROSPECTS for quick agreement on the formation of Italy's 51st post-war
government faded yesterday when it was announced that President Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro would need more consultations with political leaders.
Mr Scalfaro began consultations last Thursday, hoping to be in a position to
ask someone to form a government by the end of this week. However, he has
found the parties in an unprecedented state of disarray, with none of their
leaders offering mutually acceptable guidelines.
The president has to nominate a politician capable of mustering a majority
in the fragmented legislature left by the April 5 elections. The field of
potential candidates for the premiership remains wide open. The most
controversial choice tested by the new president was that of Mr Bettino
Craxi, the Socialist leader. Mr Craxi was prime minister from 1983-87 and is
recognised as a skilful politician.
With his image seriously damaged by his known friendship with key figures in
the Milan corruption scandal, all the parties were cool about the idea of Mr
Craxi leading the next government - including his supposed allies, the
Christian Democrats.
The two parties fought the April elections on the same platform, proposing a
renewal of the outgoing coalition with their minor allies, the Liberals and
Social Democrats. Mr Craxi still believes this coalition possible on the
basis of a narrow parliamentary majority with 48 per cent of the vote. The
Christian Democrats are less than enthusiastic and sufficient numbers of the
party are willing to sabotage such a deal if attempted.
As demonstrated in the recent parliamentary vote for the new president,
broad alliances have to be sought looking beyond the outgoing four-party
coalition. The next government to be credible requires broad-based support.

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Auditors qualify accounts of
Regalian Properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE uncertain future of the UK property market has prompted auditors to
qualify the accounts of Regalian Properties, one of the best-known UK-quoted
property companies.
Ernst &amp; Young, the auditors, qualified the accounts because of 'the very
considerable uncertainty that continues to affect the property markets and
the difficulty of placing valuations on potential development sites,'
together with the uncertain timing of property sales and risk of a breach of
bank covenants.
Regalian's fate is likely to be shared by many other property developers
this year, in the view of Mr Eugene Bannon, an Ernst &amp; Young partner. 'It
will not be unusual to find qualification on uncertainty of value,' he
warned.
'We are required to get supporting evidence (for valuations). In a stagnant
or bombed-out market, it is very difficult to get that evidence,' he said.
Mr David Goldstone, chairman of Regalian, said he believed that auditors'
caution concerning property accounts had been heightened by the recent
difficulties of Olympia &amp; York, Speyhawk, Mountleigh and Heron. The problems
in valuing property were highlighted last week when Heron's portfolio was
valued at Pounds 1bn, Pounds 300m less than a valuation a month earlier.
Regalian, which announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 26.8m (Dollars 48.77m)
for the year to March 31 and passed its final dividend, made provisions of
Pounds 32.9m against its portfolio.
A block of luxury flats in Kensington Palace Gardens and a development site
at Paddington, both in London, are the chief sources of uncertainty.
Although Kensington Palace Gardens is now valued at about half the asking
price of Pounds 120m a year ago, the unusual nature of the building makes it
difficult to value. The auditors also queried the timing of Regalian's
planned development in Paddington, still valued at Pounds 23m.
A provision of Pounds 5m was taken against a Pounds 10m development site at
Heron Quay in London's Docklands, which has been mothballed because of the
insolvency of Olympia &amp; York, its partner.
Mr Goldstone's son Lee, who has worked at Regalian for 12 years, has left
because of the constraints on new development over the next four years.
Regalian's net asset per share fell from 146.8p to 104.8p. At its year-end,
it had gross debt of Pounds 130.1m and net assets of Pounds 122.7m. The loss
per share was 19.74p, compared with last year's earnings of 8.02p. The share
price fell from 22p to 15p.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION of the Dollars 1.6bn (Pounds 870m) Chandra Asri olefin
(petrochemical) plant in West Java may be delayed by uncertainty over the
security of a Dollars 550m line of credit from state-owned Bank Bumi Daya
(BBD).
The Indonesian government has said BBD's irrevocable letter of credit must
not be drawn down, but bankers close to the project say contractors,
including Japan's Toyo Engineering, may have to call on the facility.
Uncertainty over the facility is adding to delays finalising the remaining
finance, about half the project's total cost, required for the project's
completion. Bankers say committed finance includes BBD's credit and a
further Dollars 212m of loans drawn down as equity for the project.
Last October the government said Chandra Asri was being postponed until
after 1995, although BBD's letter of credit had already been signed and
purchase orders made. The decision was part of a government move to cap
state finance for large projects prompted by Indonesia's growing
international debt.
The project was first announced in March, 1991, and backers include the
Bimantara Group run by President Suharto's second son, and Mr Prajogo
Pangestu, a prominent Indonesian businessman.
Last April, the government gave the project the go-ahead on condition that
its cost was reduced to Dollars 1.6bn from Dollars 2.25bn, and that it
proceeded under full foreign ownership using offshore finance.
The government said the project's connection with the BBD had to end, and
its credit viewed as bridging finance.
However, 'the text of the (BBD) letter of credit has not been altered,' said
one banker. Instead, shareholders have undertaken to government to raise
alternative finance if BBD's facility is called on.
This undertaking, however, 'does not alter BBD's (legal) obligation to pay
up,' the banker stressed.
In mid-1991, Toyo Engineering placed purchase orders and some large items,
including turbines, have been supplied. Toyo Engineering may soon have to
call on BBD's letter of credit, say bankers, and would have to pay almost
the full amount to suppliers if equipment cancellations are made.
'The question, of course, is whether the shareholders have any money' to
fulfil their undertaking, said a banker.
The Bimantara Group had a turnover last year estimated at Rupiah 2,200bn
(Dollars 1,075m) but industry officials say other projects in which it is a
shareholder have been delayed by lack of finance.
If the shareholders fail to arrange alternative finance, BBD will be obliged
to pay, or breach the loan's covenant.
The government plans to make state banks into limited liability companies,
but bankers say failure to pay would be tantamount to breaking a sovereign
guarantee.
Although the government has said it will not fund the Chandra Asri project,
bankers say it will wish to protect Indonesia's reputation of meeting
international obligations.

overhaul the army

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin yesterday appointed army commanders to top positions
in the new Russian defence ministry and called for effective borders with
the Baltic republics in an attempt to stop western spies from infiltrating
Russia.
In a move going some way to restoring the land forces to their traditionally
dominant role, Colonel-General Viktor Dubynin, former commander of Soviet
armed forces in Poland, became first deputy defence minister and chief of
staff. Colonel-General Valery Mironov, commander of Russian forces in the
Baltics, will be deputy minister responsible for personnel and training. The
two other new deputy ministers are Colonel-General Vladimir Toporov, until
now the commander of the Moscow military district, and General Georgy
Kondratiev, who has been in charge of the Turkestan military district which
covers all of Central Asia.
Since key army commanders supported the abortive August coup against
President Mikhail Gorbachev, the army's influence has been curtailed with
the air force supplying the Commonwealth defence minister, Marshal Yevgeny
Shaposhnikov. The Russian defence minister, General Pavel Grachev is a
former paratrooper.
Apart from loyalty to President Yeltsin and their contacts in politically
sensitive areas such as the Moscow military district, another trait of the
new men is their relative youthfulness, with most in their late 40s.
Illustrating his difficult balancing act in pushing through unpopular
economic reforms and keeping conservative forces happy, President Yeltsin
told a meeting of top military men that there was no alternative to recent
price rises but promised officers an 80 per cent pay increase.
Speaking ahead of a trip to the US next week, during which both sides hope
to conclude fresh cuts in long-range nuclear weapons, he also accused
Washington of seeking unilateral advantage over Russia in current arms
negotiations. Mr Yeltsin assured the top brass that he would resist US
attempts to dictate nuclear arms cuts that would strip Moscow of its
multiple-warhead, land-based missiles, the heart of its force, but leave
Washington with potent sea-launched systems.
'If such a decision is taken, the United States would find itself in a more
advantageous position,' he told the gathering at the white marble 'Russian
Pentagon'. The existing accord would force the US to cut its arsenal from
12,000 to about 10,000 nuclear warheads and the ex-Soviet states to slash
their arsenals from about 10,000 warheads to 8,000.
Both sides are seeking further reductions, with Washington proposing a 4,700
ceiling and Moscow advocating 2,500.
He also said in an interview that he had ordered a tightening of borders
with the Baltics because their lax entry formalities allowed foreign agents
access to Russia. He also said Russia needed a proper border with Azerbaijan
because it had introduced 'visa-free entry from Iran and Turkey'.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Slovaks rule out talks with Havel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PRAGUE, BASLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospects for successful talks on the future of the Czechoslovak
federation faltered again yesterday as the Slovak nationalists ruled out a
meeting with the Czechoslovak president, Mr Vaclav Havel.
Mr Vladimir Meciar, the newly-elected leader in the Slovak republic and his
Czech counterpart, Mr Vaclav Klaus, were to meet President Havel today in
Prague to continue their attempts to agree on a reduced federal state which
would bind the Czech and Slovak republics together. They will instead meet
without the president.
Mr Havel's presidential re-election could become the biggest stumbling bloc
in negotiating a federal structure. Mr Meciar has pledged to bloc the
re-election of Mr Havel in the federal parliament after the latter called on
voters not to support candidates with 'dictatorial tendencies'. But the
Czech side has refused to back down on its support for the president, with
Mr Klaus saying it was 'the basis for any further negotiations'.
A first meeting between Mr Meciar and Mr Klaus on Monday night only revealed
the extend to which both men disagree over the future of the country, with
Mr Klaus unambiguously rejecting the Slovak demands for some sort of
economic and defence union.
Mr Klaus, however, called for the quick formation of a government before
July 5 when the presidential election is due in the federal parliament. But
Mr Meciar told reporters this scenario was highly unlikely.
According to Mr Meciar, any federal structure would be temporary until a
referendum on independence is held in Slovakia, possibly by the end of the
year. He also said that a referendum should be initiated by the Slovak
parliament and not the federal parliament as the law currently stipulates.
The new Slovak parliament is likely to take a series of measures violating
federal law. Mr Meciar, together with Mr Peter Weiss, leader of the renamed
communist party in Slovakia which came out second in last weekend's
elections, said they would immediately abolish in the republic the federal
law which forbids former high-ranking communist officials and secret police
agents from holding public office for five years.
Mr Meciar is believed by his opponents to have removed, in his short spell
as Slovak interior minister after the revolution, any incriminating evidence
on his relations to the hated secret police.
The break-up of Czechoslovakia would probably lead to a significant
renegotiation of at least the trade elements of the country's association
agreement with the European Community, according to a senior Czechoslovak
official, writes Ian Rodger in Basle.
'One party to the agreement would no longer exist so we would have to
negotiate separate agreements or else find some modus vivendi,' Mr Zdenek
Drabek, of the federal economics ministry, said. Mr Drabek was attending a
conference on problems in eastern Europe, sponsored by the Institute for
East-West Studies.

THE accident on Tuesday at the coalmine in Ukraine, which has claimed at
least 55 lives, threatens to spark protests against the deteriorating
economic conditions in Ukraine by the well-organised Russified miners from
the eastern regions of the country.
The accident, a methane gas fire, was at the Sukhodolska Skhidnia mine in
Luhansk, the easternmost region of Ukraine. By late yesterday afternoon
rescue workers had recovered 55 bodies and expected to find more buried in
the deep mine shafts.
Before the accident the miners of the Donbas region had planned to picket
the Ukrainian parliament in Kiev and the disaster is likely to add to their
anger.
Mr Yuri Bolderov, a dynamic union leader, said that next week the miners
would push their demands for greater regional economic autonomy, higher
wages, and the removal of the conservative prime minister, Mr Vitold Fokin.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Romania emerges from a long winter: The economic situation
is improving despite political setbacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VIRGINIA MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE International Monetary Fund's decision last month to grant Romania a
stand-by credit of Dollars 500m and World Bank agreement on a Dollars 400m
loan for 1992-3 are proof that the country's economic situation is
improving, even while it continues to struggle with the issue of electoral
legislation.
Romania has stabilised considerably since September when three days of
miner-led riots in Bucharest toppled Mr Petre Roman's reformist government.
In contrast, this winter was marked by an absence of unrest with few work
stoppages or popular protests, despite the further erosion of living
standards experienced by most Romanians.
Romania has also begun to receive more support from the outside world, after
two years of diplomatic isolation. Last month, talks began for Romania's
associate membership of the European Community, while the country has
recently signed bilateral treaties with Germany, Greece and several former
Soviet republics.
Above all, US-Romanian relations have improved, culminating in last month's
visit by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, the most senior
US official to visit Romania since early 1990.
But perhaps the greatest reason for increased optimism is that the
government, led since October by Mr Theodor Stolojan, an economist, has
begun to tackle economic reform once more. In recent weeks, the government
has unveiled a new economic strategy, drawn up with the help of the IMF,
which withheld its final tranche of credit last year.
The immediate goal is to stabilise the economy which is performing at below
65 per cent of 1989 levels. More specifically, the new strategy aims to halt
the decline in production; control inflation which has averaged more than 14
per cent per month so far this year; and build up the country's gold and
hard currency reserves, currently at a little below Dollars 1bn, ahead of
next winter's fuel imports which this year cost the country around Dollars
500m per month.
So far, the government appears to be putting its strategy into practice,
albeit slowly. In the past month the national bank has raised interest rates
from 28 per cent to 80 per cent, ended restrictions on companies' hard
currency holdings and begun to devalue the leu, the national currency.
However, while Romania's position has undoubtedly improved, any optimism is
tempered by a look to the immediate future. Rising unemployment is liable to
increase social tensions. As the government admits, its anti-inflationary
policies will at least double unemployment to more than 1m, or around 12 per
cent of the workforce, by the end of the year. For many Romanians, with
average real incomes already reduced by more than 30 per cent since 1989,
the months ahead will be even more difficult.
In the meantime, the political outlook is discouraging. A dispute between
the government and parliament over the timing of general elections (which
should have been held before May 20) resulted this week in a parliamentary
rejection of electoral legislation. Romania is now unlikely to hold
elections before October. The decision comes as a blow to Mr Stolojan, a
non-partisan, caretaker prime minister, who has won support for his economic
policies but has been unable to convince an increasingly divided parliament
of the need for electoral legislation.
Until elections take place, there is unlikely to be a significant upturn in
foreign investment, which on March 31 had only reached Dollars 188m in the
period since January 1990. Nor are donor countries expected to pay up
pledged credits and aid of more than Dollars 2bn for 1992, money the country
desperately needs to undertake further reform.
At the same time, parliament's in-fighting has held up legislation critical
for reform. The country is still without an adequate bankruptcy law or
legislation to re-establish a stock exchange, while delays in passing new
foreign investment regulations are holding up an important exploration deal
involving four western oil companies.
Meanwhile, Mr Stolojan, who is not expected to stay in politics,
courageously soldiers on. He says he is implementing his strategy ahead of
the elections because it represents the only course of action available.
But the questions remain. Future governments, faced with one of eastern
Europe's weakest economies and high unemployment, may not have the strength
to continue what he has started.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Lithuania averts political crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VILNIUS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE government of Mr Gediminas Vagnorius, the Lithuanian prime minister,
narrowly survived a vote on his resignation on Tuesday night and will now
continue to govern until elections timed for the autumn.
Mr Vagnorius has claimed that the bitterly-divided parliament has prevented
the passing of urgent laws and has been unable to agree a new constitution
for the country.
At the same time, the failure of Mr Vytautas Landsbergis, the chairman of
the Lithuanian Supreme Council, to get support in a referendum last month
for the reintroduction of the office of president has weakened his authority
and that of the right-wing government which he appointed.
Ministers said yesterday that no decision could be made on the presidency or
on the constitution for some months. At least four versions of a
constitution are now drawn up, with their authors being split between
options which call for a strong presidency - favoured by Mr Landsbergis -
and those which call for a strong parliament, favoured by the opposition
groups on the left.
Mr Algirdas Saudargas, the foreign minister, said that 'we have no stable
majority in parliament but the left-wing is also divided. They don't really
want to govern, so we will carry on'.
Lithuania, like Estonia and Latvia has so far been unable to persuade the
Russian government to agree to its demands to withdraw the 35,000 Russian -
formerly Soviet - troops from its territory. A meeting between Mr
Landsbergis and Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, in Moscow at the
weekend ended only with a vague promise from Mr Yeltsin to speed up their
withdrawal. However, General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister,
has said that the troops will not be fully withdrawn until 1999.
The politics-weary Lithuanians are being asked to vote again on Sunday on
whether or not they wish the Russian army to leave the country - a move
aimed at putting further pressure on the Russian government, and also at
convincing the west to give further support to the demand for withdrawal.
However, the vote is widely seen as unnecessary and potentially damaging if
there is a large abstention.
Economic reform has proceeded rapidly in Lithuania, with 50-60 per cent of
flats and many small businesses and shops privatised, and with a claimed
48,000 farms transferred from state to private hands.
Meanwhile, the planned introduction of a stock market on July 1 is likely to
be delayed by two months
The introduction of the new unit of currency, the Lit, has been delayed and
will not happen until the end of the year. An economic programme is now
being discussed with the IMF, with further negotiations timed for next week.
Mr Vytenis Aleshkaitis, the minister for foreign economic relations and the
main economic reformer in the government, said yesterday: 'We need a period
of stability urgently in order to introduce the new currency and to cope
with the economic shocks associated with it.
'But I think that the direction of policy is now so clear that any
government will have to continue our policies.'

<TEXT>
ANGRY French farmers yesterday stepped up their demonstrations against
agriculture policy reform in the European Community.
Protests were recorded in at least seven areas - from Nantes, where market
gardeners dumped several tons of vegetables on the streets, to Rennes, where
shallot growers ransacked a local agriculture ministry office, and Toulouse,
where farmers continued to man road blocks for a second day. In the
Eure-et-Loire district, south-west of Paris, tractor drivers staged an
operation escargot (go-slow), causing many traffic jams.
Mr Louis Mermez, agriculture minister, yesterday met farm organisations to
study how to implement the reforms, and said the government was ready to
hold a parliamentary debate on agriculture.
France's RPR Gaullist party accused the ruling Socialists of 'deception' and
of betraying farmers' interests in the recent agreement on EC farm policy
reform.
Mr Raymond Lacombe, president of the FNSEA, the main farmers' union, tried
to cool the temperature yesterday by reminding farmers that they could only
influence the detail, but not the basic direction, of EC farm reform.
However, a vocal minority of French farmers is resolutely against against
the principle of a decline in guaranteed prices and a shift towards direct
income aid, as envisaged in the reforms. They are represented by Rural
Coordination, an extreme splinter group, which yesterday called on its
members to toughen their protests. Rural Coordination was formed late last
year, in protest against the perceived ineffectiveness of a large
demonstration by the two mainstream unions, the FNSEA and the CNJA, in
Paris.
The movement, made up of discontented FNSEA and CNJA members, wants an
increase in farm prices and the complete abandonment of the EC reforms. The
two unions believe this is unrealistic.

THE European Commission agreed yesterday that Germany could continue to ban
the toxic chemical PCP on environmental grounds even though European
Community rules allow limited use, Commission officials said, Reuter reports
from Strasbourg.
It is the first time the Commission has exempted an EC country from applying
legislation designed to create a single market. It decided that Germany
could opt out under an article of the Treaty of Rome allowing governments to
impose national rules on grounds of environmental protection.
Germany requested the exemption after the EC adopted legislation last year
restricting the marketing and use of pentachlorophenol - a wood and textiles
preservative.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR US Senator yesterday warned that military action might be needed to
curb Serbia's territorial ambitions, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican from Indiana, urged the Bush
administration to take the lead in getting the United Nations and Nato to
bring about 'a stern enforcement' of a ceasefire in Yugoslavia and, failing
all else, to be ready to use force against the regime in Belgrade.
'The time for drawing the line has come,' he said. 'The UN should authorise
nation states to use force. Nato should draw up plans for a comprehensive
use of force as thorough as that formulated for air, sea and ground forces
in Desert Storm.'
'A final demand,' he went on, 'should be made for a ceasefire followed by
diplomatic resolution of claims and boundaries, with the UN or Nato, in some
combination, providing peacekeeping forces.' If Serbia did not yield, he
said, 'it should face sufficient military force to ensure its certain and
swift defeat.'
Senator Lugar's intervention is an attempt to break the logjam of US
political indifference to events in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The Senate foreign
relations committee is to take public discussion further today in special
hearings.

WOOL Prices at auction sales last week were looking a little shaky, and the
British Wool Marketing Board lowered its reserves by about five per cent
without leading to any improvement in the clearance to the trade. This week
Australia opened more definitely easier and prices for a wide range of wools
were down in the 10-15 Australian cents a kg range. With the season now
having only a couple of weeks to run, and official forecasts indicating a
higher clip than first expected this season and next, price prospects are
being adjusted downwards. The AWC market indicator closed 9 cents down at
577 cents a kg.

FT  11 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Nordic insurer masterplan turns sour -
Uni's ambitious merger scheme has come painfully unhinged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Three of the most prominent Scandinavian insurers - Skandia, the region's
biggest, Uni Storebrand of Norway and Hafnia of Denmark - have seen dramatic
share price declines following an unsuccessful bid by the ambitious Uni to
lead a merger between them.
With premium rates rising and options elsewhere in the Scandinavian
financial sector unattractive, the insurers could be worth buying for their
recovery potential. Would-be buyers, however, are urged to be cautious.
When Sweden's SE Banken sold its 28.2 per cent share in Skandia last
November, Uni joined forces with Hafnia to accumulate a 47.7 per cent
Skandia stake, and said that it intended to build a Nordic insurer big
enough to compete in the newly liberalised European market.
The effort has been blocked by Skandia's management and shareholders - which
are protected by a voting structure skewed to protect the interests of small
shareholders who own the majority of the equity - and the effort has now run
into the sand, leaving both Uni and Hafnia substantially out of pocket.
Both companies borrowed to fund their Skandia holdings, now worth more than
50 per cent less than at the time of purchase last year.
A subsequent resolution of the dispute would have involved Uni exchanging
its stake for Skandia's non-US reinsurance interests and Skandia taking over
control of Hafnia. This collapsed largely because of nationalist inspired
opposition from Hafnia's Danish pension fund owners.
The result is a stand-off and continuing uncertainty. Skandia was trading
yesterday at SKr109 (down more than 50 per cent on its price nine months
ago); Uni Storebrand is languishing at NKr53, while Hafnia has seen over 75
per cent of its equity capitalisation disappear in the past 12 months.
Few analysts are interested in the heavily indebted Hafnia which, in
addition to its loss-making stake in Skandia, also owns over 30 per cent of
its rival, Baltica; but Uni and Skandia excite some interest.
Mr Tim Dawson of Merrill Lynch, is an enthusiast of both Uni and Skandia,
which he says are 'reasonably cheap on fundamentals. It is difficult to see
the downside. Any further price falls and the visible value would just start
screaming at you.'
Mr Angus Runciman of BNP Securities favours Skandia. With the takeover
threat defeated and its potential predators humbled, he says, the Swedish
company is now free to pursue a conservative strategy, focusing on the
expansion of its less volatile life assurance business and a steady
reduction in its cost base.
The company has a strong solvency margin of around 75 per cent, and although
earnings have slumped - partially as a result of losses from Scandinavian
credit insurance and non-life insurance losses in the UK - a return to
profits is on the cards in 1993 and 1994.
Nonetheless, it remains heavily exposed to property values, with over 60 per
cent of its 'solvency assets' tied up in Swedish real estate. Mr Bob Yates,
of brokers Fox Pitt Kelton, reckons that property could decline further this
year, and further dent the company's underlying asset base.
Mr Yates agrees that the shares are around the floor but does not expect the
recovery in earnings to be sufficient to provide support for the price until
1994. In the meantime he is concerned by the overhang of the Uni and Hafnia
holdings.
If a scheme could be found which would place the whole of the stock
overhang, then at present price levels the share would represent reasonable
value, says Mr Yates. 'If not, the stock could dribble out in bits and
pieces and this could act as a brake.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Fall in April consumer demand
weakens Dow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
TRADING on US markets retained its negative bias yesterday as share prices
fell sharply for the second consecutive day, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 26.70 at 3,343.22.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 2.82 at
407.24, while the Nasdaq composite fell 4.09 to 569.71. Turnover on the NYSE
was 208m shares.
Although no new economic figures were out, the announcement late on Tuesday
of a 6.3 per cent drop in April consumer borrowing unsettled sentiment. The
unexpected decline was the largest monthly drop since 1980. Any weakness in
consumer demand could threaten the economic recovery, so the borrowing data
added to investors' worries about the outlook for an economy that is already
performing below expectations.
Among individual stocks, Northern Telecom fell Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 36
5/8 in active trading after the company warned that its second quarter
earnings would be below market expectations, and that its revenues may even
be lower than a year ago.
International Paper, which fell on Tuesday after a Salomon sector downgrade,
recovered with a gain of Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 66 3/8 after another
broking house, Oppenheimer, added the stock to its short-term buy list, and
predicted that the shares would trade in a range of Dollars 72 to Dollars 75
over the next three to six months.
Stocks of securities companies fell amid concern that interest rates may
have bottomed and that equity prices may be heading for a sizeable
correction. Both factors would hurt the sector's earnings, which have been
running at record levels for the past 12 months. Among the losers were
Salomon, down Dollars  7/8 at Dollars 31 3/4 , Merrill Lynch, down Dollars
5/8 at Dollars 44 3/4 , Morgan Stanley, Dollars 1 7/8 lower at Dollars 48
7/8, and PaineWebber, Dollars  3/4 weaker at Dollars 19 1/4 .
General Instrument returned to the market. The company's initial public
offering of 22m shares was made at a price of Dollars 15 a share. At the
close the stock was at Dollars 15 on turnover of 2m shares. Universal Foods
eased Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 28 7/8 after warning that 'very difficult
times' in the French fry business would probably result in revenues for the
current fiscal year coming in below Dollars 900m.
On the Nasdaq market, comments from Technology Solutions that a write-off
for receivables and contracts this year would not affect net income failed
to impress the market, which sold the stock down Dollars 5 1/2 to Dollars 14
1/2 .
Canada
TORONTO prices closed lower in moderate trading. According to preliminary
figures, the TSE composite index fell 17.46 points, or 0.52 per cent, to
3,368.63. Declines led advances by 318 to 236, volume fell to 24.9m shares
from 35.9m shares previously, and trading value was CDollars 359.7m against
CDollars 397.3m.

release

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR the second consecutive day, a reluctance to trade actively ahead of
important economic figures left US Treasury markets becalmed yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  7/32 at
101 1/8 , yielding 7.895 per cent. The two-year note was also slightly
weaker, down  1/32 at 100 1/16 , yielding 5.074 per cent.
Treasury prices were actually firmer overnight in foreign markets, but as
soon as New York opened they began to give ground.
A prediction late on Tuesday by Mr Robert Black, president of the Richmond
Federal Reserve, that the US economy could sustain a 3 per cent growth rate,
contributed to yesterday's modest declines.
The dominant trend in the market was an unwillingness to take large
positions ahead of today's economic data. The consensus of forecasts is for
a 0.3 per cent rise in May producer prices and a 0.7 per cent rise in May
retail sales.
If the inflation number is significantly better and the retail sales much
worse than the consensus, then the chances of another Fed interest rate cut
will improve. Few market participants, however, are expecting any surprises
from the data.
In the credit markets, the Fed arranged Dollars 2bn in customer repurchase
agreements to add reserves to the system and push the Fed funds rate lower.
At the time of the intervention Fed funds were trading at 3 5/8 per cent,
and by midday remained stuck at that level, slightly below the Fed's target
of 3 3/4 per cent.
Analysts said the customer repos were not an attempt by the Fed to ease
monetary policy.
DOMESTIC buying interest helped to support the UK government bond market
with long-dated issues closing about  1/8 of a point higher on the day.
The gilt market traded in a narrow range, opening on a weak note but gaining
strength from the firmness of the pound. The Liffe futures contract opened
at 97.24, trading between 97.21-97.30 and ending the day at the top of its
range. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 115 15/16 to
116 1/16 to yield 9.32 per cent.
However, traders said gains at the far end of the maturity range were held
in check by concerns about future supply. The Bank of England announced last
week that it would sell stock in the 2007-2012 maturity range at its auction
on June 24.
Yesterday, dealers said the rise in the 9 per cent gilt due 2012 (which is
considered a possible auction stock) was limited by concern about supply in
this area, with the issue rising only  1/32 to 99 7/8 .
The Bank is due to announce the auction stock next Tuesday.
THE German government bond slipped back during the day following the
weakness of the Deutschemark in the foreign exchange markets.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 88.37 and drifted down to a low of
88.16 before regaining some of its lost ground to end at around 88.30.
Traders said they saw some profit-taking following the bund market's recent
rally in the wake of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty.
Last week's referendum result shook the European government bond markets and
prompted investors and dealers to switch out of the higher-yielding bond
markets into the D-Mark bloc.
JAPANESE government bonds opened on a depressed note, due to the combination
of a weaker yen and the overnight fall in the US Treasury market, but picked
up to close slightly higher on the day.
Dealers said buying interest was stronger for short-dated issues than for
longer maturities.
The benchmark No 129 issue traded in a narrow range, opening with a yield of
5.53 per cent and ending the day at 5.51 per cent.
'The market is sidelined, awaiting fresh factors,' said one trader, adding
that many of the participants are awaiting the Bank of Japan's quarterly
'Tankan' report tomorrow.

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Mobil tests demand for sterling paper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIRMER demand for sterling bonds was tested yesterday by a Pounds 110m
seven-year deal for Mobil North Sea Oil. The deal was considered
aggressively priced to yield 30 basis points more than the comparable gilt
issue. Deutsche Bank Capital Markets won the mandate to arrange the issue,
after the borrower took bids from a range of banks.
Eurosterling bonds are trading at historically tight levels. The World
Bank's 10 per cent Eurobonds 1999 are yielding 23 basis points less than the
comparable gilt. Deutsche Bank said the pricing was reasonable compared with
BP's 9 1/2 per cent Eurobonds due 1998 which are trading at a spread of 32
basis points over the curve, since BP is considered a weaker credit than
Mobil.
Nevertheless, a 30 basis point spread was considered over-ambitious by some
dealers. 'We did sell bonds, but could not have got rid of a large chunk,'
said one trader.
The deal was quoted at 99.40, fractionally above its fixed reoffer price.
Dealers have reported that the Eurosterling bond market has been a
beneficiary, to some degree, of the malaise in some other European bond
markets. Although the sterling bond market lost some ground after the Danes
rejected the Maastricht Treaty, it has held up relatively well, and is one
of the higher-yielding European markets still considered relatively secure.
Dealers report some funds put aside for the Ecu bond market have been used
to buy sterling Eurobonds.
In the French franc sector, two new issues emerged on the back of firmer
market conditions. Credit Local de France added FFr1bn to its recent issue
of 15-year zero-coupon bonds, while Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer
Francais, the national railway, issued FFr3bn bonds, split between domestic
and international investors.
A further French franc deal is expected to add to already heavy supply in
the sector this week when Caisse Nationale des Autoroutes, the motorway
financing agency, taps the market today. CNA is believed to be preparing a
FFr2bn nine-year deal, having cancelled plans to issue in Ecu.

Maastricht, Berlin, Paris and Moscow, Mr Marcel Cockaerts, chairman, said:
'We want to grow in concentric circles (around Belgium).'
The bank wants to build a network of subsidiaries in neighbouring countries
and a presence in other countries if warranted.
The new policy is already reflected in the balance sheet: at the end of
March, 47.1 per cent of non-consolidated assets were foreign, up from 43 per
cent a year ago and 38 per cent in 1987.
'In volume, foreign transactions are now as important as domestic ones,' Mr
Cockaerts said.

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: A share of Brazilian equity
action - Life is becoming easier for foreign investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S macroeconomic changes are moving slowly by the standards of some of
its Latin American neighbours - but capital market reforms, particularly for
equities, are accelerating fast.
Foreign institutional investors can trade directly in Brazilian equities; a
25 per cent tax on stock profits has been eliminated for foreigners;
institutional investors from abroad but registered in Brazil can trade
currency and gold futures, and invest up to 25 per cent of their portfolios
in domestic fixed-rate debt.
As a result, from a modest base, foreign portfolio investment in Brazil has
begun to rocket. During the first four months of 1992, some Dollars 2.3bn
entered the country, with Dollars 1.4bn going into equities. This compares
with Dollars 1.5bn in the whole of last year, of which Dollars 760m was in
shares. In 1990, overall foreign investment was Dollars 688m, and in 1989,
Dollars 333m.
The road to reform can be traced to Mr Ary Oswaldo Mattos Filho, who in 1990
assumed the top spot at the CVM, Brazil's regulatory watchdog. He moved the
commission out of its old headquarters in the financial backwater of Rio de
Janeiro and relocated in Brasilia, the political capital. He then outlined
proposals for change in a January 1991 blueprint.
Mr Mattos Filho implemented many of the plan's 50 points before leaving the
CVM. Mr Roberto Faldini replaced him in March. Coincidentally or not, the
last significant changes in capital market regulations were announced in
January, when the definition of foreign institutions permitted to invest in
Brazil was widened.
Mr Faldini seems more cautious than his predecessor. A former official of
Abrasca, the association of public companies, and a director of Metal Leve,
the car parts manufacturer, he is considered more sympathetic to company
owners and management.
On taking office at the CVM, he voiced his opposition to Mr Mattos Filho's
proposal to force Brazilian companies to issue higher proportions of voting
stock. Owners of Brazilian companies generally prefer to offer non-voting
shares, leaving stockholders few options for influencing policy.
This is encouraged by a requirement that Brazilian pension funds hold at
least 25 per cent of their portfolios in equities, providing a captive
market for non-voting stock in the narrow Brazilian bourses.
Many companies argue they do not offer voting shares because the secondary
market is too small. Mr Mattos Filho, however, believed liquidity was
lacking precisely because companies offer so few voting shares. Mr Faldini
is opposed to plans, laid down by the former CVM chief, aimed at breaking
this vicious circle through regulatory reform.
Mr Alvaro A. Vidigal, president of the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa),
which accounts for 70 per cent of the country's trading, advocates
eliminating the pension fund investment floor but letting companies
determine the mix of their offerings.
Since the terrain was opened to foreign institutions last year, reformers
have been calling for an invitation to individuals from abroad. Mr Vidigal
favours the immediate introduction of these investors.
Mr Faldini publicly defends a gradual approach, first including citizens
from Brazil's partners in the proposed Mercosur common market: Argentina,
Paraguay and Uruguay. That move is expected later this year, when the final
touches are put on an agreement that will give investors from Mercosur
countries equal footing with native citizens in each of the four countries.
First, however, negotiators must resolve the issue of capital gains tax,
which exists in Brazil, for instance, but not in Argentina.
Meanwhile, Bovespa wants to guarantee greater openness. One step has been to
adopt electronic trading. It is also strengthening self-regulation.
In May, its administrative council upheld an earlier ruling to punish
directors and market operators of Banco Garantia, who were charged with
selling stocks at below market price to bring down the exchange's Ibovespa
index. The offending shares were primarily those of Telebras, the
state-controlled telecommunications company that accounts for over half of
trading.
The individuals were suspended for one year and fined Dollars 25,000 each,
the maximum by law. Bovespa is now investigating Garantia (as opposed to
individual directors and employees), and may bring charges against the bank.

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Procordia privatisation
advisers appointed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SWEDISH government will today announce the appointment of Enskilda
Securities of Sweden, Goldman Sachs of the US, and SG Warburg of the UK as
the financial advisers for the SKr18bn (Dollars 3.13bn) privatisation of
Procordia, the Swedish pharmaceutical and food group.
Procordia is due to be privatised this autumn as part of the Swedish
centre-right government's substantial privatisation programme. Up to half
the offering will be made available to international investors.
The state and Volvo, the automotive group and largest industrial company in
the country, each owns 42.7 per cent of the voting shares in Procordia.
Earlier this year, Volvo announced plans to merge with Procordia, but its
proposal was rejected by the Swedish government.
The state's stake in Procordia is valued at about SKr18bn at current market
prices. Some bankers have expressed doubts over whether it will be able to
sell it all in one tranche, given that the Swedish stock market has seen new
equity issuance of between SKr10 and SKr12bn a year in recent years.
However, the state is understood to be eager to sell its shareholding in one
big privatisation.
Up to 50 per cent of the shares will be made available to international
equity investors, with Goldman Sachs and SG Warburg acting as joint global
co-ordinators for the offering. Enskilda will be responsible for the Nordic
region.
Goldman Sachs will manage the US tranche, SG Warburg will manage the UK
tranche, and the rest of the offering in Europe and Asia will be split
between the three houses.
Volvo and the state recently agreed to a share exchange whereby Volvo would
increase its voting stake from 42.7 to 45 per cent ahead of the
privatisation.

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: FDA to reconsider Upjohn
injectable contraceptive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UPJOHN, the US drugs company, has applied to the Food and Drug
Administration (FDA) in the hopes of getting approval to market an
injectable contraceptive product in the US.
The company said it would seek approval a second time to market the drug
Depo-Provera as a contraceptive.
In the 1970s, the FDA declined to give the green light for the drug's
marketing as a contraceptive because of questions about its safety. A board
of public inquiry, later asked by Upjohn to review the FDA decision, ruled
against the company in 1984.
The key concern at the FDA was data from an Upjohn study suggesting
Depo-Provera caused breast cancer in beagles. The FDA has since decided the
beagle dog is not an appropriate animal model for predicting cancer effects
in humans.
The drug is, however, already on the US market for use in treating kidney
and endometrial cancers. Analysts estimate its US sales at about Dollars
108m, while the revenues from non-US markets, where the drug is sold in some
90 countries as a contraceptive and as an anti-cancer product, are estimated
at an additional Dollars 74m.
More than 30m women in 60 countries are understood to use the drug as a
contraceptive.
Although Upjohn has not conducted any new studies of the drug since
withdrawing its last application, the company has told the FDA that a study
by the World Health Organisation concluded the use of Depo-Provera as a
contraceptive did not constitute a health risk.
In a separate development, the chairman of Warner Lambert, the US
pharmaceutical and consumer products group, yesterday said he expected the
company's second-quarter 1992 net earnings per share to rise by 13 per cent
year-on-year, suggesting a net profit of about Dollars 175m.
The second-quarter 1992 earnings per share would be about Dollars 1.30,
against Dollars 1.15 in the same period of 1991.
Mr Melvin Goodes said the quarterly earnings rise would place Warner-Lambert
on track to improve full-year 1992 earnings by about 15 per cent.
The full-year comparison, however, is only appropriate when comparing the
company's 1991 earnings before a Dollars 544m accounting adjustment, and
other restructuring charges. Warner-Lambert actually recorded 1991 net
income of only Dollars 34.8m after all charges were taken.
Mr Goodes said the company's second-quarter sales rise would exceed the 8
per cent increase of the first three months of 1992, when sales totalled
Dollars 1.3bn. That would suggest a sales rise of about 13 per cent, to
Dollars 1.4bn, compared with the second quarter of last year.
Warner-Lambert's chairman said second-quarter sales gains were
across-the-board, with both the drug and consumer divisions showing
strength.
Wall Street seemed unmoved by Warner-Lambert's forecast; the share price
declined by Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 59 1/8 .

<TEXT>
WANG Laboratories, the US office computer company, has filed suit against
the US subsidiaries of Mitsubishi Electric and NMB Semiconductor, both of
Japan, charging that the companies are selling products that infringe Wang
patents.
Wang claims Mitsubishi and NMB used its patented single in-line memory
module (SIMM) technology without license. A SIMM is a holder for multiple
memory chips that plugs into a computer circuit board to add memory
capacity. The devices are widely used in personal computers.
The suits are the latest move in an aggressive patent enforcement effort by
Wang. Last August, Wang won a similar case against NEC and Toshiba. The US
court awarded Wang damages of Dollars 3.3m and ordered the two companies to
halt manufacturing and sale of SIMMs in the US.
Since then, Wang has reached licensing agreements with over 30 US and
foreign companies. These include several companies named in a trade
complaint alleging unfair trade based upon patent infringement.
Yesterday, Wang said it had withdrawn the trade complaint because all the
companies named have since licensed the technology, with the exception of
NMB and and Mitsubishi.

<TEXT>
PARAMOUNT Commun-ications, the publishing and entertainment group, continued
its earnings recovery in the second quarter of its financial year, which
ended on April 30.
The company made a net profit of Dollars 28.3m, or 23 cents per share, in
the three-month period, compared with a loss of Dollars 55m, or 47 cents a
share, in the corresponding period of 1991.
Mr Martin Davis, the Paramount chairman, said yesterday that the company was
'well on the road to a substantial year-to-year improvement in results.'
He added that the entertainment division, which includes the Hollywood-based
Paramount Pictures film and television programme studio, had generated
Dollars 91.7m of operating income in the quarter, compared with a Dollars
40.6m loss a year ago.
Paramount's publishing operations, which traditionally record the bulk of
revenues and income in the second half of the year, suffered a Dollars 25.3m
loss in the second quarter, slightly less than the Dollars 29.2m loss in the
equivalent 1991 period.
For the first six months of fiscal 1992 Paramount earned Dollars 46.7m, or
39 cents a share, against a loss of Dollars 62.3m, or 53 cents per share, in
the first half of last year.
Paramount's total revenues for the second quarter of fiscal 1992 were
Dollars 927.9m, compared with Dollars 868.1m a year ago.
Revenues for the first six months were Dollars 2bn, against Dollars 1.77bn
in the same period of 1991.
Mr Davis noted that in addition to the strong performance of Paramount's
Hollywood operation, the second-quarter results also benefited from gains in
the company's broadcast television holdings and from sharply higher
operating income from Madison Square Garden, the New York sports and
entertainment venue.
Wall Street reacted indifferently to the Paramount profits recovery, and the
share price was marked down Dollars 1 at Dollars 45 1/4 at the close
yesterday.

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: NEC sets its sights on the 21st
century - The Japanese group refuses to be blown off course by recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is something almost quaintly old-fashioned in the optimism of Mr
Tadahiro Sekimoto, the white-haired, bespectacled president of NEC.
NEC, with Y3,774bn (Dollars 29.5bn) in sales last year, dominates the
Japanese personal computer market and is the world's biggest maker of
semiconductors.
Mr Sekimoto is exuberant about the future, even though his company just
reported a 61.7 per cent decline in consolidated pre-tax profits in the year
to the end of March.
NEC's share price has dropped 10 per cent in the past month; over 25 per
cent since the start of the year.
Capital spending this year is being cut by 19 per cent.
Semiconductor prices have fallen and NEC is losing money in its home
appliance division - Y28.87bn last year, which is a painfully large amount
next to total pre-tax profits of Y51.44bn.
Some of NEC's competitors are talking about the need to lower expectations
on future growth, to work for higher quality profits, and to narrow the
focus of research and development.
For Mr Sekimoto, however, the recession in the electronics industry is
merely a bump on the road, to be navigated and forgotten as it recedes
quickly in the rear-view mirror.
'Our Japanese-style management is not affected by the immediate results; we
are not that short-sighted.
'We are looking at least five years ahead, sometimes 10 years ahead,' he
says.
This is perhaps the expected response from a man who has been at the helm of
a leading Japanese company for 12 years, and as vice-chairman of the
Keidanren, the leading business federation, is in effect a certified board
member of Japan Inc.
There may, however, be more behind Mr Sekimoto's show of optimism than mere
bravura and ritual adherence to the sacred canons of Japanese management.
Mr Steve Myers, analyst at Jardine Flemming, says: 'In the domestic market,
NEC's performance in the past year has been exceptionally impressive.'
After growing at 20 per cent a year for five years, sales of personal
computers in Japan last year declined by 8 per cent.
Yet NEC sales grew by 3 per cent to 1.35m units. As a result, its share of
unit sales in the Japanese market has risen to 60 per cent from the roughly
50 per cent share it has enjoyed in recent years.
NEC's proprietary computer operating system is becoming ever more entrenched
as the de facto Japanese standard, even though it is incompatible with any
other operating system in the world and in spite of efforts to unseat it.
IBM has attempted to create an alternative, DOS/V, a Japanese variant of
Microsoft's MS-DOS, capable of running Japanese language programmes and any
software written for IBM computers worldwide.
NEC's customers, however, appear satisfied with the hardware, software and
service they are receiving from their traditional supplier, or at least not
dissatisfied enough to switch vendors.
In part because of NEC's domination of the PC market in Japan, Mr Sekimoto
argues NEC is well set for the era of 'downsizing' - the move away from
large mainframe computers to smaller, yet powerful workstations and PCs -
that has shaken the computer giants such as IBM.
While this may be true, in fact downsizing is only an expected trend in
Japan. Mainframe sales in Japan grew last year, and NEC won 18 per cent of
the market, with sales of 1,448 units and a 26 per cent growth in revenues.
In total, NEC's sales of computers and electronic equipment grew by 11 per
cent last year to Y1,949bn.
But NEC did encounter problems in semiconductors.
In the mid-1980s NEC reduced its dependence on the price-volatile dynamic
random access memory chips, which account for 25 production of chip
production.
This helped to insulate NEC from the initial downturn in the market last
year, which was concentrated in Dram chips, but was little help when the
entire market turned soft.
NEC's external sales of electronic devices, mainly semiconductors, fell by
4.9 per cent last year to Y617bn, although, after including chips for
internal use, production increased 2.7 per cent to Y946bn.
Semiconductors sales, however, are highly cyclical and the Electronic
Industries Association of Japan has forecast continuing growth in the market
for electronic devices at about 6 per cent a year.
Mr Sekimoto says that NEC should be able to beat the average rate of
increase.
Sales of communication equipment were also down by 3.7 per cent to
Y1,001.6bn, but this, too, is an area of expected high growth, even if NEC
loses market share in a domestic market where competition is increasing.
Perhaps the only genuine blight on the accounts is NEC's Y193.2bn operating
costs on Y164.4bn of sales in home electronics, which consists of VCRs,
satellite dishes and the like.
Mr Sekimoto speaks glowingly of the prospects of using NEC technology in
high-definition television.
Yet NEC's persistence in the highly competitive arena of consumer
electronics, where it is a marginal player without an established brand
name, appears more than anything to be a tribute to the difficulty Japanese
companies have quitting a business.
Mr Myers commented that there was a significant misallocation of engineering
resources.
It is plain that in spite of much talk in Japan about the need for
structural change in industry with the end of an era of rapid growth, Mr
Sekimoto is not about to let NEC be blown off course by the recession.
NEC is, of course, making concessions to the recession, including the cut in
capital spending to Y210bn, mainly in the semiconductor business. This will
help reduce future depreciation charges, which have swollen 30 per cent in
three years to Y222.5bn last year.
Recruitment is being cut this year by 14 per cent to 1,200.
Even so, NEC is increasing research and development spending this year by 3
per cent to Y310bn, and Mr Sekimoto has no plans to overhaul the company's
wide-ranging scientific and technical programmes.
He says: 'Our growth rate depends on the success or failure of our
development of new technology.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Sage to restructure and sell
non-core assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAGE group, the South African financial services, life assurance and
property organisation, has announced a major restructuring.
Mr Louis Shill, founder and chairman of Sage, said the deal would increase
the marketability of shares, enhance the expansion of core businesses and
strengthen the capital base by combining the group's three segments into
one.
In terms of the deal, Sage Financial Services (SFS) will cease to be a Sage
subsidiary, acquire Sage Holdings and the non group-held Sage Property
Holdings (SPH) shares. SFS will change its name to Sage Group, which will
then have two divisions - property and finance, and life assurance.
Mr Shill also said Sage planned to dispose of non-core interests which would
raise at least R300m (Dollars 106.7m). This would help reduce group gearing
from its current level of 55 per cent to negligible levels.
The new group will have assets on the balance sheet of R3.2bn. This puts it
in the second league of South African life companies. It does, however, have
some important strategic investments, notably a 21 per cent holding in
Universa, the company which holds 25 per cent of ABSA, South Africa's
largest banking group; and a 26 per cent holding in Rand Merchant Bank
Holdings.
The terms of the restructuring are that 270 new SFS ordinary shares will be
issued for every 100 ordinary shares held in Sage, and 55.6 new SFS shares
for every 100 ordinary shares held in SPH.
In the year to March, Sage Holdings lifted attributable earnings to R28.4m
from R23.6m. Earnings per share rose 14.5 per cent to 118.07 cents and the
dividend roseto 70 from 60 cents a share.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN Telecom shares fell sharply yesterday after the Canadian-based
telephone equipment-maker painted a gloomy picture of its second-quarter
prospects.
The company's share price plunged 7 per cent on the Toronto Stock Exchange
yesterday morning to CDollars 43 but then firmed slightly to close at
CDollars 43 3/4 . The shares reached an all-time high of CDollars 57.50 as
recently as last January.
Dr Paul Stern, Nortel's chairman and normally an inveterate optimist, warned
institutional investors in New York yesterday that the second-quarter's
financial performance was likely to be 'below expectations.'
Revenues are now expected to be below the USDollars 2.1bn posted in the
second quarter of 1991. Besides the effects of the recession, Dr Stern said
some business in the US has been deferred pending the award of modernisation
contracts.
Revenues will also drop by about 5 per cent as a result of the sale of some
businesses which were acquired as part of Nortel's purchase of STC, the UK
telecommunications group, in March 1991. These units were included in
second-quarter 1991 earnings.
Dr Stern expressed confidence, however, that growth would resume in the
second half, thanks to the recovery of deferred business, a strong order
book, and the elimination of distortions caused by the STC divestments.
Nortel has reported unbroken improvements in quarterly earnings for more
than three years.
But the STC acquisition has accounted for much of the recent rise. STC has
been integrated into Nortel's European operations, and the company says it
is unable to calculate the UK company's precise contribution.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Domestic Appli-ances (GDA), the Anglo-American maker of white goods,
is about to join a European partnership with the leading French and Spanish
suppliers of household appliances.
GDA, which is owned jointly by GEC of the UK and General Electric of the US,
said it would shortly join Temfa, an 18-month-old partnership of Thomson
Electromenager (TEM) of France and Fagor, the leading Spanish white goods
group.
The partnership aims to pool purchasing of jointly-used components, to share
research ideas and technology, and to give its members the opportunity to
sell each others' products under their own individual brand names.
While this is only a limited alliance, it unites the third-largest domestic
appliance group in Europe after Electrolux of Sweden and Bosch-Siemens of
Germany.
GDA's main brands are Hotpoint, Creda, Jackons and Cannon. TEM, a subsidiary
of the state-owned Thomson electronics group, sells as Brandt, Thermor,
Thomson and Vedette among others.
Fagor sells under its own name, as well as White Westinghouse, Edesa and
Aspes.
All three companies are leaders in their countries and have teamed up to
achieve the greatest economies of scale which are possible within the
continued fragmentation of regional tastes in the European white goods
market.
This is 'a response to the growing segmentation of the white goods market,
which in contrast to brown goods (audio-visual equipment) differs sharply
from one continent to another, even from one region to another,' said Mr
Henri Lagarde, the chairman of TEM.
The partnership is set up under European Community law as a European
economic interest grouping, a simple structure designed to encourage
cross-border alliances, but which does not include industrial joint
ventures.
Mr Bruce Enders, GDA's managing director, hoped the deal would allow his
group to enlarge its product range by sourcing from its partners, as well as
to sell some of its own products to the continental European partners for
sale under their brand names.
This is the latest stage in TEM's campaign to strengthen its product range,
following a joint venture to make microwave ovens with Toshiba, the Japanese
electronics group in 1989; the formation of Temfa in 1990; and a joint
venture last year to make electric ovens and hobs with De Dietrich, one of
France's last independent producers of home appliances.

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Tapie in dispute over disposal
price
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BERNARD Tapie Finances (BTF), the holding company of Mr Bernard Tapie, the
controversial businessman who recently resigned from the French cabinet
because of a fraud case, yesterday suffered another blow when a dispute
flared up over a disposal.
Lugdunum Finance, which has agreed to buy the La Vie Claire chain of health
food shops from BTF, is now arguing over the price of the deal. BTP claims
that the price was set at FFr110m (Dollars 20.5m), whereas Lugdunum says it
was set at just FFr100m.
BTF, which last week announced it had fallen from net profits of FFr47.97m
in 1990 to a loss of FFr294.9m in 1991, is taking legal action to try to
recover the remaining money.
La Vie Claire is one of several businesses that BTF is selling to raise
capital to cut debts incurred in its acquisition of the Adidas sporting
goods group two years ago. BTF, which later this month is to make the final
FFr730m payment on its Adidas loans, recently put its Testut-Terraillon
weighing machine business on the market.
The financial problems of BTF have intensified speculation that Mr Tapie,
who resigned as minister of urban affairs after only two months in the post,
may be forced to cede control of Adidas.

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Nestle pays FFr480m for Suez
stake

<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food group facing the threat of opposition from the
European Commission in its attempt to complete the takeover of Perrier
mineral water, is paying FFr480m (Dollars 90.5m) to buy 1.5m shares in Suez,
the French industrial and financial group.
Nestle, which formed a joint venture with Banque Indosuez, the Suez banking
subsidiary, to stage the Perrier bid, is buying the shares from Exor, the
French property company that controls Perrier. Exor, after fighting fiercely
against Nestle's FFr15.46bn bid, finally agreed to support it.
Nestle which last week disclosed that European Community anti-cartel
investigators were challenging its bid for Perrier, paid FFr320 a share for
the Suez stake yesterday. Exor, which is controlled by IFINT, an investment
vehicle for Italy's Agnelli family, originally owned a 2.3 per cent stake in
Suez, which is a 10 per cent shareholder in Exor.
Under the terms of the settlement of the Perrier battle, Nestle agreed to
buy part of Exor's stake in Suez. Credit Agricole, the French bank which is
one of Exor's minority shareholders and which came to the fore in the early
stages of the Perrier battle when it objected to IFINT's original partial
bid for Exor, had earlier bought some of Exor's shares in Suez.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Danka Business Systems rises 25%
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Danka Business Systems, which distributes office equipment throughout the
eastern US through its operating subsidiary based in Florida, lifted pre-tax
profits by 25 per cent, from Pounds 9.35m to Pounds 11.7m, in the year to
March 31.
Mr Mark Vaughan-Lee, chairman, said Danka's performance had been
significantly better than most of its competitors, enabling the group to
increase market share.
During the second half the group acquired three distribution companies and a
fourth was bought in May. All would be fully integrated into its branch
network which now totalled 84 outlets. The group is investigating the
possibility of acquiring distribution operations in Europe.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 115m (Pounds 93.8m), generating operating
profits of Pounds 13.2m (Pounds 10.8m). Earnings per share came through at
29.3p (23.1p) and a final dividend of 2.5p is recommended for a 3.75p (3p)
total. There was an extraordinary charge of Pounds 922,000 (Pounds 2.23m).

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Oriflame back on track with Pounds 8.89m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Oriflame International, the direct sales cosmetics group, yesterday reported
a return to sales and profits growth and said that the acquisition of the
ACO skin care brand in Sweden, along with expansion in eastern Europe made
for an encouraging outlook.
The year to March 31 saw sales rise by 17 per cent to Pounds 64.7m (Pounds
55.2m) and operating profit jump 74 per cent to Pounds 7.6m (Pounds 4.36m).
Financial income declined to Pounds 632,000 (Pounds 3.16m), but despite this
the rise at the pre-tax level was 47 per cent at Pounds 8.89m (Pounds
6.05m). The favourable comparison was due to an exceptional item of Pounds
2m carried last year.
Despite recession in its main markets the company managed to raise sales by
7 per cent in Scandinavia and by 10 per cent in the UK.
The final dividend is maintained at 8p for an unchanged total of 12p on
earnings per share of 15.7p (10.3p). The shares rose 6p to 170p.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Mansfield advances to Pounds 11m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MANSFIELD Brewery lifted pre-tax profits by almost 37 per cent, from Pounds
8.04m to Pounds 11m, over the 12 months to March 28.
Property disposals contributed Pounds 407,000, against just Pounds 25,000,
but interest charges jumped to Pounds 6.12m (Pounds 4.48m) reflecting the
group's capital expenditure programme.
Profits at the operating level, after charging Pounds 1.2m against free
trade debts and loans, advanced some 34 per cent to Pounds 16.7m (Pounds
12.5m). The trading margin improved from 7.4 per cent to 9.3 per cent.
Mr Geoffrey Kent, chairman, said total draught beer sales rose 2.8 per cent,
while the group improved its share of the regional market, estimated to have
fallen by 4.6 per cent.
He attributed the volume increase to the purchase of new pubs - Mansfield's
estate expanded by 22 per cent to 453 houses by the year-end and another 6
have been acquired since then - and improved sales to the wholesale trade.
In contrast, free trade sales volumes were marginally lower while tied trade
showed an underlying decline of 4.4 per cent on a like-for-like basis.
The expansion of the pub estate led to borrowings rising Pounds 16.5m to
Pounds 59.8m - equal to gearing of almost 44 per cent at the year-end.
Turnover totalled Pounds 114m (Pounds 108m). A proposed final dividend of
9.6p brings the total for the year to 13.6p (12.1p), covered 3.6 times by
earnings of 48.6p (38.6p) per share.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Refocused Amersham at Pounds 21m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMERSHAM International, the health science group which has refocused its
activities on radioactive products, increased pre-tax profit by 34 per cent
to Pounds 20.7m in the year to March 31.
The previous year's pre-tax figure was reduced from Pounds 16.5m to Pounds
15.5m to provide for the burying of radioactive waste, which has been stored
since dumping at sea was banned in 1983. The provision also knocked Pounds
9.6m off net assets.
Turnover improved to Pounds 273.5m (Pounds 242.4m) and operating profit to
Pounds 23.5m (Pounds 19.7m). Interest costs were cut to Pounds 2.8m (Pounds
4.2m) as net debt came down from Pounds 41.1m to Pounds 700,000 following
the final Pounds 47m of Eastman Kodak's payment for the clinical reagents
division.
Mr Kirk Stevenson, finance director, said the operating profit from clinical
reagents fell from Pounds 9.4m to Pounds 6.4m as income switched towards a
royalties stream rather than a divisional contribution.
Ongoing businesses increased profit by 42 per cent to Pounds 23.9m (Pounds
16.8m), after a Pounds 3.3m rise in R and D spending to Pounds 13.7m. The
figures benefited from Pounds 1.9m of exchange rate gains.
Life sciences, which serves academic institutions and the research
departments of pharmaceuticals companies, made by far the biggest profit
contribution of Pounds 20.9m, up 26 per cent, on sales of Pounds 92.7m
(Pounds 80.7m). This partly reflected recovery from a poor fourth quarter of
the previous year.
Mr Bill Castell, chief executive, said there had been substantial growth in
North America and a focus on margins. It was pushing further into the
pharmaceuticals sector.
Healthcare remained the laggard with a profit contribution of only Pounds
100,000 (loss of Pounds 1.8m) on Pounds 83.8m turnover, up 33 per cent. This
included a full year of Medi-Physics, a US radiopharmaceuticals com-pany
which had been brought back into profit in the second half. Price
competition con-tinued to depress the generic market.
Ceretec, a brain imaging product, increased sales from Pounds 10m to Pounds
14m. New products would include Metastron, for prostatic cancer, and Myoview
to trace blood flow through the heart.
The industrial quality and safety assurance division improved its profit
contribution by 24 per cent to Pounds 4.6m on Pounds 36.2m sales.
Earnings per share went up 44 per cent to 23.7p (16.5p). A final dividend of
8.8p makes a total of 12.5p (11.8p).
COMMENT
The newish management at Amersham has gained considerable credit for
refocusing the business and restoring strong earnings growth - hence the 15p
share price rise to 479p. Life science should continue to drive profits
forward, although the most room for improvement clearly lies in healthcare.
Lower interest costs should help offset a further fall in the contribution
from clinical reagents. A pre-tax forecast of Pounds 24m gives a prospective
p/e of more than 17. The share price has virtually doubled since November
1990 as the group has shed some problems and re-established its growth
credentials. There seems little scope for short-term improvement, although
it is still at a small discount to the health and household sector.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: HSBC eligible for FT-SE 100
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FT-SE 100 Index steering committee yesterday considered the eligibility
and timing of HSBC Holdings becoming a constituent of the FT-SE 100 and
agreed that all shares of HSBC Holdings would be eligible for inclusion in
the Index from the date on which the final offer for Midland Bank became
unconditional in all respects.
In arriving at its decision, the committee took into account that:
1) HSBC Holdings is UK incorporated.
2) HSBC Holdings has made a public commitment that the enlarged company will
become UK tax-resident from January 1 1993.
3) It would cause unnecessary confusion and disruption to exclude shares in
HSBC Holdings following the final offer becoming unconditional in all
respects, given that Midland Bank was presently a constituent of the Index
and would need to be removed but not replaced by the enlarged HSBC Holdings
until January 1993.
The Committee reserves the right to remove HSBC Holdings from the Index
should the company not become UK tax-resident, as planned.
FT-A All-Share Index
The Joint Index Committee of the Institute and Faculty of Actuaries has
agreed that HSBC Holdings will join the FT-Actuaries All-Share Index from
the date the final offer for Midland Bank becomes unconditional in all
respects.
The committee reserves the right to remove HSBC Holdings from the Index
should the company not become UK tax-resident as planned.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Australian underwriting losses cut CE Heath
profits by Pounds 6.5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CE HEATH, the insurance group, reported pre-tax profits sharply lower at
Pounds 19.1m compared with Pounds 25.6m, for the year ended March 31 1992,
hit by underwriting losses run up by an Australian subsidiary.
However, before exceptional items the profit rose to Pounds 31.5m (Pounds
28.8m), largely as a result of strong growth in insurance broking with
turnover rising to Pounds 101.6m (Pounds 77.5m) - topping the Pounds 100m
mark for the first time in the group's history.
A final dividend of 18.375p is declared, giving an unchanged total of
25.875p.
The losses, which emerged in the form of an exceptional item of Pounds
12.4m, resulted from a discontinued line of aviation reinsurance business
formerly underwritten by the group's Australian underwriting operation, CE
Heath International Holdings, whose flotation was announced in March.
Insurance broking profits were up to Pounds 18.6m (Pounds 16.1m),
underwriting profits down to Pounds 12.8m (Pounds 14.8m) and computer
services higher at Pounds 5m (Pounds 3.8m). Investment income was lower at
Pounds 13.5m (Pounds 14.3m).
Income at the group's computer services division is up to Pounds 39.2m
(Pounds 34.1m).
On an underlying basis brokerage income increased by 13 per cent while
expenses were up 9 per cent.
Brokerage expenses increased to Pounds 97.7m (Pounds 76.8m).
Heath has now virtually completed its withdrawal from the higher risk and
more volatile world of insurance underwriting, marking an end to a process
of corporate restructuring started in 1986.
After the flotation of CE Heath International Holdings in Australia, Heath
reduced its own shareholding from 90 per cent to 46 per cent.
A separate underwriting subsidiary, the Bermuda-based Pinnacle was disposed
of last year.
COMMENT
Yesterday's exceptional item shows that Heath has not completely left behind
its difficulties of the mid-1980s, which is one of the reasons why the
market reacted unenthusiastically to the results, marking the shares down 5p
to 397p.
Another is that dividend cover, even on the assumption that profits over the
next 12 months climb to Pounds 28m, will remain tight for the foreseeable
future. Profits of that level would produce earnings per share of about 23p,
leaving the group on a prospective p/e of more than 17.
At first glance it might seem demanding, but the results also show the group
is now a long way from the crisis-ridden days, when its senior broking staff
were rushing for the exits. Heath is now much more focused on its core
broking activities, with a balanced spread of business stretching from more
stable but low-margin UK retail, to more exciting and bigger margin
wholesale business, such as the group's Latin American operations which
showed impressive growth last year.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Racal confirms October deadline for Chubb float
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Ernest Harrison, Racal Electronics chairman, yesterday set an October
deadline for the demerger of Racal Chubb, its security division.
Shares in the floated Chubb, which yesterday reported a 20 per cent jump in
operating profits last year, will be distributed to Racal shareholders after
details are published in September.
The demerger will follow a similar pattern to last year's successful
distribution of Racal's stake in Vodafone, the cellular telephone network
operator, a move Sir Ernest initiated after what he said was the market's
consistent undervaluation of Racal's non-Vodafone businesses.
Confirmation of the demerger came as Racal reported annual pre-tax profits
of Pounds 55.6m, up from a loss of Pounds 21.8m last year and comfortably
ahead of a forecast it made at the height of its successful defence against
a hostile bid from Williams Holdings last winter.
Racal not only reported sharply higher profits at Chubb, but also almost
halved debt to Pounds 121m after strong cash flow in its operations and a
tightening of controls on working capital.
This debt will be split between Chubb and the Racal rump ahead of the
demerger and is among details being worked out with the company's advisers.
Sir Ernest will become chairman of the quoted Chubb while Mr David Peacock
will remain chief executive.
The Pounds 55.6m pre-tax profit was achieved on sales of Pounds 1.61bn, up
only 3.6 per cent on 1990-91. They were struck after exceptional items of
Pounds 29.76m relating to reorganisation and redundancy costs.
More controversially, Racal made an extraordinary charge of Pounds 53.83m,
about Pounds 22.4m relating to the cost of demerging Vodafone and defending
the Williams bid.
About Pounds 18m, however, related to a provision for the disposal and
closures in 1992-93 of loss-making overseas businesses. Application of a new
accounting standard, now in a draft form and likely to come into force next
year, might have included some of these costs above the line.
A further Pounds 12.17m relating to the businesses which will be sold or
closed was written back through reserves to shareholders' funds.
The extent to which Racal's debt fell during the year surprised analysts,
and led to a sharp increase in forecasts for profits this year of more than
Pounds 100m. Racal's share price rose 4.5p to 69.5p.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Doubt caston future of 'multiple directors'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NON-EXECUTIVE directors would no longer be able to serve on more than one
board because of greater obligations suggested in recent proposals, Sir
Adrian Cadbury said yesterday.
'The days of the multiple director are over,' said Sir Adrian, chairman of
the corporate governance committee which last week proposed that
non-executives be given greater responsibilities. As a result, he said, a
presence on more than one board will cause strains on time and efficiency.
Sir Adrian, speaking at a Confederation of British Industry conference on
corporate governance, said his committee's proposals meant that far more
individuals would have to serve as non-executives than at present.
'The current network system (of selecting non-executives) draws on the
narrow pool. That must be changed and we must look to non-traditional
sources for non-executives,' he said.
The Cadbury Committee on Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance
recommended a voluntary code of practice for boards of directors,
accountants and auditors.
It urged that audit committees be composed solely of non-executives, that
non-executives should have no financial, or personal interest in the company
and that they be allowed to solicit independent advice on board decisions at
company expense.
The committee, initiated by the accountancy profession and the Stock
Exchange, is backed by the Department of Trade and Industry and the Bank of
England.
Separately, the government signalled yesterday that if the voluntary code
urged by the committee appeared to be having little effect, it would
consider regulations.
'If a sufficiently strong case for further action were to emerge, taking
into account the wider issues which the Department (of Trade and Industry)
has to consider, the government would not be true to its past record if it
did not take action,' he said.

FT  11 JUN 92 / US drops key Rio objection: Declaration enshrines good
environmental practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US smoothed the way to the climax of the Earth Summit last night by
removing its objections to one of the pivotal documents under negotiation -
the Rio Declaration of environmental principles.
The shift came only 24 hours before President George Bush is due to arrive
in Rio de Janeiro to face what is likely to be a hostile reception from
environmental activists.
In Washington, White House officials, while confirming their backing for the
declaration, said that the US was still seeking 'improvements in the
language of a section or two' of the declaration.
Mr Marlin Fitzwater, the White House spokesman, promised an 'aggressive'
speech from President Bush before his departure from Washington, setting out
'the hard truths about environmental protection that we believe should be
pointed out'.
In Rio, Mr William Reilly, the administrator of the US Environment
Protection Agency and leader of the US delegation, said that US concerns
about parts of the declaration had been 'accommodated' by other summit
participants.
That would not involve changing any of the language, which is the result of
hundreds of hours of painstaking negotiation.
Although the declaration is not a document which participants will sign, the
summit's achievements would have been significantly weakened if the US had
remained on record with its objections.
The principles take the form of a Ten Commandments of good environmental
practice, though they also address other issues such as poverty, women's
rights, and sovereign control of natural resources. The US had taken
particular exception to a reference to the 'right to development', which it
said could mean putting economic growth above human rights.
Mr Reilly also said that Mr Bush will personally sign the treaty on climate
change, one of the two legally binding documents agreed. The US still
refuses to sign the other treaty, on biological diversity.
'Things have moved well here today,' he said. 'We expect most issues to be
wrapped up tomorrow.'
World leaders gather today for two days of summit talks and formal
ceremonies before the 12-day conference reaches its climax with a 'round
table' of world leaders on Saturday evening.
Activists complain that many agreements have been so watered down as to have
little meaning. Negotiations were still continuing last night on forest
conservation and environmental aid for Third World countries.

FT  11 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Capital adequacy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It took EC finance ministers until well into Wednesday morning to agree a
deal on the so-called Capital Adequacy Directive (CAD) on capital standards
for securities houses. But the grounds for disagreement were so many that
the compromise negotiated by Portugal represents a significant step forward.
The threat to London's broking and underwriting houses appears to have
dissolved, principally because brokers will have a 10-day window in which to
place large deals without additional capital requirements. All the same, the
market will want reassurance on how quickly capital must be allocated once
the window closes. The liquidity of London's stock borrowing market has been
preserved. Perhaps equally important to Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, no
other centre has emerged with a notably stronger hand.
As to the broader picture, the Commission believes the stalled investment
services directive should now gain new impetus. Arguably, it is too early to
draw that conclusion. Until it is clear how the CAD will work, the most that
can be said is that it represents a useful precedent. Given that Spain and
Belgium were reportedly reluctant to the last, even that has its limits.
Several technical issues are yet to be resolved. It could take several years
before each country has agreed standards in place. The CAD will be reviewed
after three years, when it will be judged alongside standards proclaimed by
the Basle committee and the securities industry's own lobby. That leaves
plenty of scope for changes. It also leaves open the ironic possibility that
the UK will introduce harsher capital requirements of its own.

FT  11 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Northern Foods
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Northern demonstrated yesterday why its shares have outperformed the food
manufacturing sector by 27 per cent over the last 12 months. A 20 per cent
jump in profits and 17 per cent earnings advance in tough market conditions
 -albeit helped by a two-month contribution from Express and Eden Vale and
Pounds 36m of balance sheet provisions - fully vindicates its strategy of
sticking to dairies, fresh products, and quality supermarket outlets.
A measure of the company's class is last year's ability to finance internal
investment from operating cash flows. The hectic pace of capital spending
will continue in the current period, which should see further double digit
earnings growth on the enlarged capital despite a higher depreciation charge
and interest bill. Express and Eden Vale are likely to yield Pounds 10m to
Pounds 15m of savings by the end of the year, though it will be 1993 and
1994 before the benefits of the current rationalisation programme really
show through.
Notwithstanding the company's insistence that the Milk Marketing Board
shake-up will be good news longer term, the transition to a more liberal
market for milk supply could be tricky for the whole sector. That said, one
would back Northern's management over others to rise to the challenge, which
is one good reason why its prospective earnings multiple is 2.5 points
higher than Unigate's.

FT  11 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Racal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Ernest Harrison was evidently displaying unusual modesty last December
when he forecast profits of Pounds 50m for Racal Electronics in 1991-92.
Thanks particularly to a squeeze on working capital, the actual outturn was
Pounds 6m higher than expected and debt has fallen by nearly half to Pounds
121m. As if that was not enough to justify an 8 per cent leap in the shares
to 69p yesterday, a firm timetable has emerged for the Chubb demerger
promised in the defence against the Williams bid.
It would be rash, however, to assume that the shares have a long way further
to run. Racal is already trading nearly 30 per cent above the initial value
of the Williams bid, and more than 10p above the level where Williams
finally unloaded the stake it acquired. The historic multiple of 30 is
slightly more than twice that of the sector as a whole.
Racal has shown with Vodafone that demerger can unlock value both at the
time of announcement and on implementation. Some expectations on that score
must already be in the price. So apparently is a bid premium for a demerged
Chubb. The real question remains the more basic one of how much scope exists
for further growth. Racal's markets are not expanding. Margins in the
security division were already running at 10 per cent in the second half.
There is a possibility that Chubb, like Vodafone before it, may emerge
pretty fully valued.
Since the demerger, Racal has outperformed Vodafone by 50 per cent. There is
far greater scope for margin improvement on the electronics side than in the
security business which is now due to be spun off. But Racal must find a way
of increasing sales as well as margins in this division, if its shareholders
are to reap the maximum reward.

FT  11 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Qualifying assets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market has long been taking property company asset values with a
pinch of salt. But yesterday's announcement that the auditors Ernst &amp; Young
intend to qualify Regalian's report and accounts is nevertheless welcome for
bringing the issue out into the open.
No doubt the firm's decision owes something to the self-interest of the
accountancy profession. Investors have been getting increasingly litigious
of late - and not just on the far side of the Atlantic. So when a board of
directors that its assets are worth 105p per share and the market is only
prepared to pay 22p (or 15p by yesterday's close) it is understandable that
discretion should prevail.
Valuation, of course, has always been an inexact science and never more so
than in current market conditions. The problem in the Regalian case is not
just that there are few deals against which to measure the company's
estimates, but the fact that the valuations have been carried out by the
directors themselves.
This is perfectly acceptable under accounting standards as they stand, but
there is surely now a case for making independent valuations compulsory.
Without this, further qualifications are inevitable, something which
housebuilders and retailers as well as other property companies may care to
ponder.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Rifkind warns Germany not to quit Euro fighter project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Malcolm Rifkind, the defence secretary, said yesterday that he still
hoped to persuade Germany not to leave the Pounds 20bn European Fighter
Aircraft project and warned that withdrawal would be 'very damaging to
Germany's credibility as a reliable partner'.
In an interview with the Financial Times, he said there was 'very
considerable scope' for cost savings in the project, up to now involving the
UK, Germany, Italy and Spain.
Senior UK and German officials are due to meet in London today to advance
discussions about ways of reducing the cost of producing the aircraft, now
in the late stages of development.
Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, who has made clear his opposition
to continued German participation, is expected to discuss the project with
Mr Rifkind during a ministerial meeting of the Western European Union, a
nine-nation defence grouping, in Germany next Friday. Mr Ruhe is due for
further talks in London on July 6.
Mr Rifkind said that although Mr Ruhe had stated his own 'personal
recommendation', the German government had not yet reached a decision.
He issued a severe warning of the political implications if Bonn did
withdraw, referring to the recent arguments within the EC and Nato about
plans for European defence.
'I don't think it is possible for the German government on the one hand to
speak robustly about the desirability of a European defence dimension and
European co-operation, and at the same time consider withdrawing from the
single most important example of European defence collaboration at the
present time,' he said.
He said he understood Bonn's predicament in the face of parliamentary
pressure against the approval of funds for pressing ahead with the
programme. It would however be 'unfortunate' to consider withdrawing from a
20-year project 'simply on the basis of an immediate short-term
parliamentary handling problem'.
An effort was needed within the next few weeks to identify potential savings
so that decisions may be taken.
Mr Rifkind said he was encouraged by 'growing representations' within
Germany in favour of the project, including those from industry and the CSU,
the Bavarian party in the governing coalition.
He said Germany would face costs if it backed out but this would depend on
the manner of its withdrawal.
A decision to withdraw now would be premature, he added. There was no need
for the partners to commit themselves on production of the aircraft until
'sometime in 1993'.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Ex-Ferranti deputy chairman given 15-year jail sentence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and TOM FLANNERY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, PHILADELPHIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR James Guerin, former deputy chairman of the Ferranti group who was at the
centre of a Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 600m) arms contract scandal, was last
night sentenced in Philadelphia to a reduced prison term of 15 years because
he had co-operated with the government since his indictment.
Mr Guerin, 62, who was sentenced on charges of defrauding Ferranti of
Dollars 1.1bn, laundering a total of Dollars 950m of funds and illegally
exporting military technologies to South Africa and Iraq, had previously
admitted guilt as part of a plea bargain.
In theory, the prison term, which begins in two weeks, totals 46 years on
eight separate charges, of which the money laundering count amounts to 15
years. The remaining 31 years of prison for the other seven charges are all
three- and five-year terms considered 'concurrent' with the total 15 years
in jail.
Mr Guerin's lawyer, in his closing arguments to Judge Louis Bechtle in
Philadelphia, cited a recent letter by Admiral Bobby Ray Inman seeking
clemency for Mr Guerin. Admiral Inman is a top intelligence adviser to
President George Bush and a member of the proxy board of a Ferranti US
subsidiary.
He described Mr Guerin as a patriot in the letter, referring to work on US
intelligence missions in the 1970s.
Mr Robert Goldman, the chief US prosecutor in the case, responded to the
citation of Admiral Inman's letter by calling Mr Guerin 'a self-anointed
patriot'.
Mr Jim Shinehouse, president of Ferranti's US operations, said: 'We have no
comment on the outcome of these proceedings. We will continue to co-operate
with federal authorities in their pursuit of others involved in illegal
activity and we hope all related matters can be brought to a speedy
conclusion.'
Mr Guerin, who will be under house arrest with an electronic bracelet to
monitor his movements for the next two weeks, will then be placed in a
minimum security prison.

Remember the fuss about John Major's clapped-out plane which shuttled him

Tudjman's sense of importance of a republic which is the size of Wales,
reached new heights when the United Nations, rather reluctantly, decided to
add Croatia's membership to the UN. Slovenia, and war-torn
Bosnia-Hercegovina, joined at the same time.
While his neighbour from Slovenia Milan Kucan simply purchased a return

his besieged capital Sarajevo because it was too dangerous to leave,
Tudjman's response was different.
He promptly spent Dollars 18m on a new plane.

One questioner reminded chairman Maurice Saatchi that, on being asked last
year about the truth of newspaper reports that Saatchi was again going to
work for the Conservatives in the election, he had just fallen back on the
old cliche about not believing everything that you read in the press.
'I now see in the newspapers that Saatchi is going to work for Ross Perot in
his bid to become US president. Is that true?', asked the questioner.
With scarcely a pause for breath, Maurice Saatchi said: 'I am afraid the
reply is the same this year, too.'

Back in 1986, during the infamous Westland row, he lost his job and the

President Heseltine has not chosen sides, it would be surprising if he was

The bubbling 42-year-old Frenchman will not for the moment be launching
himself into politics. He's joining the defence and space division of
France's Matra group, as senior vice president, when he vacates the IISS
post in October. The former diplomat and defence ministry adviser had a

this will be a more senior job.
What will he be in charge of at Matra? Why, strategy, of course.

Psst . . .fancy owning the Greenwich meridian? A three-year lease on the
world's most famous line is being offered by the Old Royal Observatory in
London's Greenwich Park, at Pounds 150,000 per annum.
Besides being a snip compared with the Jubilee line extension, the meridian
isn't entirely imaginary. At least a few yards thereof are marked on the
ground for tourists to straddle and be photographed with one foot in the
western hemisphere and the other in the eastern. The hope is that some
company might like to get its name in the picture by becoming the line's
official sponsor, so helping to re-develop Greenwich's 'museum of time'.
The plan is to have nine galleries housing astronomical instruments and the
like, some dating back beyond the observatory's foundation by Charles II in
1675, according to project chief Stephen Deuchar. 'The work will cost Pounds
600,000. So we thought, since Accurist is now sponsoring British Telecom's
speaking clock, why not the meridian?'
Well, perhaps so, Observer said. But whatever next - put Greenwich Mean Time
itself on the market?
'How much a second d'you think we could get for it?', answered Deuchar.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Economic Viewpoint: Emu - time to go back to evolutionary
approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Obviously Bruges Group supporters cheered the result of the Danish
referendum, because they dislike 'Europe', or fixed exchange rates, or
supranational bodies, or any combination of these.
But it might be worth explaining why I should have given at least two
cheers, as someone who favours an eventual European currency, and has no
hang-up over a European political authority, so long as its functions are
confined to currency, external and internal law and order, and the other
classical functions of a limited federal government. Central European
countries would have no difficulty in participating in a minimalist
federation of this kind.
The best account I can give of my attitude is by recalling an occasion when
a Euro enthusiast was asked about a remark of Ludwig Erhard, then German
chancellor. Having made sure that the Chatham House rules of non-attribution
were being observed, the Eurocrat said: 'I was talking about serious
politicians.' The Danish referendum is a victory for those of us who are not
serious politicians in the bureaucratic, institution-building sense.
It would nevertheless be difficult for me to vote 'no' in a UK referendum on
Maastricht, partly because of my support for an eventual common currency,
and partly because most of the objectionable features in Community practice
 -such as interference in working hours and conditions of employment or
Commission 'environmental' directives on road and rail projects - are
justified by their promoters with reference to the original Treaty of Rome
or the small print of the Single European Act. Maastricht, by comparison, is
harmless. The prime minister himself defends it in terms of what it omits.
It is not worth the career of a single cabinet minister.
Having said this, the Danish result is a still a tonic for those of us who
are much keener on the exchange rate mechanism (ERM) than economic and
monetary union (Emu). For the latter, as put forward from Brussels and
Paris, was always accompanied by proposals for vast regional and structural
funds to build cathedrals in the desert and a 'social dimension', which was
anti-social and job-destroying. These plans have received a setback this
week as a direct result of the Danish referendum.
With the automatic Maastricht timetable now in trouble, it is clear that the
best way to a single European currency is through a strengthening of the
ERM. There was, indeed, once a British Treasury which warned that
'administratively imposed changes would inevitably fail to foresee future
developments'.
On the other hand, the paper argued, the strengthening of the internal
market and 'convergence on price and exchange rate stability' would lead to
rarer realignments, and smaller fluctuations within the ERM bands. With
minimal exchange rate uncertainty, and reduced costs of switching between
currencies, all Community currencies would become effectively
interchangeable; and the system 'could evolve into one of fixed exchange
rates'.
I am citing a British government paper entitled An Evolutionary Approach to
Economic and Monetary Union, published in November 1989. The paper was
conceived in Nigel Lawson's Treasury, but published when John Major had
taken over as chancellor. It was thus an orphan.
The earlier chancellor had been attracted by Friedrich Hayek's notion of
competing currencies, but competing within their ERM bands. John
Odling-Smee, who headed the team of officials then in charge, came however
to the conclusion that, except during Latin-American type hyperinflation,
most people would stick for most transactions to the currency with which
they were familiar. His idea was competing monetary policies in which the
country with the greatest non-inflationary credibility would have the lowest
interest rates. But there was room for the two ideas jostling side by side.
What sticks in my memory, however, is the contemptuous way with which the
idea in any guise was shrugged off by the continental establishment. Jacques
Delors and Karl Otto Pohl, then head of the Bundesbank, joined together in
scoffing at choice among currencies. (A short train ride to Geneva or
Salzburg would have shown them how this choice was exercised in their own
backyards.) A European monetary union, they both averred, had to have a
single currency, and that was that. In so doing they both exaggerated the
importance of legal tender laws and overlooked the extent to which a new
European unit would have to earn its place rather than be imposed by fiat or
treaty.
The scoffing was also to be heard in the UK. Sir Michael Butler, former
British representative in Brussels, dismissed the Treasury paper because it
did not involve a new institution and did not require an amendment to the
Rome Treaty. His enthusiasm for the hard Ecu (invented not by him but by
Paul Richards, an economist and a director of Samuel Montagu) derived mainly
from the fact that it did require an institution which Britain could propose
at an international conference and thus remain at the top table.
I always found, however, that the hard Ecu, treated as a serious economic
proposal, involved excessively long claims of hypothetical reasoning to form
an easy judgment upon; and it would only be confusing to revive it now.
The evolutionary route to monetary union was always the one most likely to
work. It may now become the only one. So far the Danish referendum has given
only a tiny jolt to the credibility of the ERM. Sterling has lost only a
small proportion of the gains which it received after John Major's surprise
election victory. The French franc has also fallen by a couple of centimes
against the D-Mark. Sterling and franc bonds have similarly suffered a
minuscule blow. The big jump has been in Italian bond yields, deservedly so
given that Italian participation in Emu would have flown in the face of
financial reality. ('In contrast to the British, we wanted the Germans to
sort out our financial affairs,' said an Italian friend.)
But there is a problem. The French willingness to bear the apparent
sacrifices of sticking to an unchanging D-Mark parity was linked to the goal
of a political Europe in which France would have a much greater say. Even in
the UK early advocates of ERM membership saw it as a way of imposing
monetarism by the external backdoor on the Tory 'wets'. A Big Idea is still
needed, in default of the Maastricht ambitions, to hold European currencies
together.
There is such a big idea, but it would require a Gladstone to give it
demagogic appeal. It is that of limited government based on the rule of law
and sound money, and with as much power as possible being exercised by the
people at the grass roots. So long as the idea is called 'subsidiarity' and
remains in Eurospeak, it will not be powerful enough to withstand the
demagogues and interventionists who still hanker after devaluations.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Doubts about Mr Delors
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WEEK that has passed since the narrow rejection of the Maastricht Treaty
by the Danish people has generated far more heat than light. This was
inevitable. But light there has been, nonetheless. It seems clear, first,
that the European Community cannot make progress without ratifying something
not too different from the Maastricht Treaty; second, that some
modifications to, or reinterpretation of, that treaty may be needed; and,
third, that securing the necessary ratification will be difficult.
In so delicate a situation, many might wish for a cessation of normal
business, while the EC grapples with its internal crisis. The EC has no such
luxury. Two pieces of business, in particular, are so interlinked with hopes
of ratification that they must be confronted head on. These are the futures,
respectively, of the EC budget and of Mr Jacques Delors.
Mr Delors has been the principal protagonist of 'more Europe' since his
appointment in 1984. A far-sighted, yet practical visionary, nobody, be he
devoted friend or enraged foe, can fail to respect his clarity and his
courage. But he has made enemies, partly because of his zeal for the cause,
but also because of the way he has lectured ministers and heads of
government as if they were children.
He has lost none of his outspokenness. Yesterday in his speech to the
European Parliament he chided the finance ministers of the richer EC nations
for their failure to accept the fiscal implications of the Maastricht
commitment. 'There cannot be political union,' he opined, 'if it is not
founded on a bloc which is economically and socially unified and coherent.'
Debatable view
The economics of this view are debatable. An economic and monetary union can
be combined with huge discrepancies in standards of living, provided
differences in productivity are reflected in wages. But the politics are
rather different. Poorer countries on the periphery of Europe insist that a
political union implies a commitment to narrowing of income differences.
They also insist that the pain of inflationary convergence and lower fiscal
deficits needs to be eased if their still fragile polities are to survive
the strain.
They are quite probably right. It is, in any case, difficult to accept that
the budget increase Mr Delors is proposing, from a ceiling of 1.2 per cent
of the EC's gross national product to one of 1.37 per cent, can be a serious
obstacle. Having swallowed the camel of economic and monetary union, the
finance ministers are straining at gnats.
Flood of directives
As so often before, Mr Delors is doing little more than pointing out the
logical consequences of the governments' own purposes. The same applies, as
he noted, to the flood of directives, most of which have been necessitated
by the single market programme. Even where the EC has most irritated
particular member states - over fiscal harmonisation, for example, or the
social charter - it has done so only as the mouthpiece for other
governments.
Even if Mr Delors has done little more than try to put the agreed goal of
European union into practice, his reappointment for a further two-year term
is not necessarily wise. The problem now facing the EC is how to secure
ratification of a treaty that the Danes have already rejected. Failure to
secure a treaty at all would be disastrous for the EC's credibility. But
reopening the treaty would take a great deal of time and might fail
altogether.
The most plausible strategy for getting over the present quagmire rests on
making the notion of 'subsidiarity' more credible. The British are not alone
in objecting to the way the Commission probes into the 'nooks and crannies'
of national life. German officials are saying the same thing, partly to
bring the Danes back into the fold.
Mr Delors speaks the same language. He told the Parliament that he wants to
make the EC more open and accountable, to secure extension of respect for
national diversity and to clear up the debate about sovereignty. This is,
indeed, the right way forward. The question is whether Mr Delors, a man
inescapably, however unfairly, identified with the aggrandisement of
Brussels, can convince the parliaments and peoples of Europe of this
apparently new direction. Mr Delors' arguments are, as always, worth
listening to. The question governments must ask is for how long he can
remain the best person in the EC to express them.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Arts: Dejavu - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Just over 25 years on, John Osborne has done it again. Dejavu is not Look
Back in Anger, nor is it meant to be, but it has every claim to become the
most talked about play in London. The only reservation apart from the length
 -a good three hours - and the uncertainty about how to bring it to an end
is whether you need to know the earlier piece in order to enjoy the latter.
My guess is that Dejavu just about stands in its own right, though a
thorough grounding in Look Back would help the appreciation immeasurably.
Osborne has forgotten nothing since the height of his powers. A quarter of a
century later, Jimmy Porter and Cliff are still there, relatively affluent
now and with Jimmy tending to be known as JP. The change is that instead of
Alison, Jimmy's wife, there is now Alison, his daughter, and instead of
Helena, his wife's friend, there is now Helena, the friend of his daughter.
The rest of the plot, if you remember it, is much the same right down to the
use of the ironing board and the switch of allegiance.
Apart from the sheer pleasure of seeing Look Back revisited, there are two
fundamental reasons why this production by Tony Palmer works so well. One is
that Osborne at his best is such a brilliant stage-writer: the words and the
allusions come tumbling out, joke after joke. The other is that this Jimmy
Porter - the ageing John Osborne in all but name - is played by the youngish
actor, Peter Egan.
The decision to go for Egan in the end rather than some older hand like
Peter O'Toole is crucial to the success. It means that even when JP is at
his most cantankerous and bilious, he still has a youthful charm. The danger
of playing him like a stereotype - angry young man turned reactionary fogey
 -has been avoided. Although Egan appears to get through enormous quantities
of red wine and champagne in the course of the show, it never seems that it
is wholly the drink that is talking. This is Porter Senior reflecting on
Porter Junior: curiously enough he tends to the conclusion that the
generation of the 1950s had it better.
Jimmy looks younger than Cliff (Gareth Thomas), as perhaps he always was at
heart. What the pair of them still have in common, however, is the ability
to turn on a double act. The two man cabaret show is at the heart of their
performance. Where Osborne scores, just as he did in Look Back and also in
The Entertainer, is in mixing the corniest of old music hall jokes with the
most literary.
Some of the awfullest old lines are repeated, like 'my feet hurt' - 'why not
try washing your socks?' Then we are off with 'Auntie Wordsworth'. Osborne's
language is steeped in Shakespeare virtually every other line. Remember that
team of comics, Jock and Day, who stood tiptoe on the misty mountain top?
This mock-literary stuff is the preferred home of Jimmy and Cliff. They
were, as one of them says in Dejavu, camp before anyone knew what it meant.
There are also the Osborne swipes at fashionable trends. JP has become a
wine snob, and uses the language to dismiss the Nicaragua '89. In the
Osborne world there is now an A level in joined-up writing; for GCSEs you do
Elton John since nobody has heard of T S Eliot. The local shopping precinct
is called after Winnie Mandela. But the style is not repetitive because the
jokes are so infinitely varied.
There is a lot more besides. The Sunday papers are back: Osborne claims not
unfairly to have invented the category 'posh'. The bears and squirrels of
Look Back now appear regularly in the Valentine's Day messages in The Times.
If the earlier work was seminal, this is an essential catch-up.

JOHNNY SUEDE (15) Lumiere, MGM Oxford St, Gate
DOUBLE X (15) Local Release
STRAIGHT TALK (PG) Odeon West End
THE BEAST (18) ICA
Johnny Suede, a writing and directing debut by cameraman-playwright Tom
DiCillo, who photographed Stranger Than Paradise and penned the one-man play
on which this new film is based, is an example of 'sort of' cinema. It is
sort of wonderful and sort of weird. And it is sort of about this
sultry-looking innocent (Brad Pitt) who loves suede shoes and rock music,
who models himself on Ricky Nelson - complete with well-oiled quiff - and
who cannot make up his mind about love. Should he choose beautiful,
disturbed Darlette (Alison Moir), who lives with the neighbourhood sadist,
or sensible, forthright Yvonne (Catherine Keener), who teaches him how to
find stimulating parts of the female anatomy?
Johnny, for most of the time, can find scarcely anything. Except for a pair
of magical suede shoes which fall from a night sky onto the roof of a
telephone booth and become his Oz-like talisman. Johnny lives in a moody,
noir-ish city not unlike New York. (Actually it is New York but unnamed.)
And he drifts, drifts, drifts, from day to day.
This is deeply charming film. It has a sleepy wit and a blissful line in
tell-tale decor: strawberries and flamingos for dinky Darlette, no-nonsense
hard angles for Yvonne, damp walls and a fridge containing one mouldering
carrot for Johnny. In addition Brad Pitt, the young hoodlum from Thelma And
Louise, plays the sweet, dim, pompadoured hero with a charisma that reminds
me - indeed has reminded everyone to judge by the American press quotes - of
James Dean.
The spirit of this film is simultaneously nostalgic and 1990s. The
pop-historical reference points are rock 'n' roll and 1950s teenage
dandyism. But the narrative technique is modern. Wandering stories which
appear to be no stories at all have been embraced by Jim Jarmusch, Gus Van
Sant, Hal Hartley and Aki Kaurismaki, and their films represent the
healthiest crisis cinema has experienced for decades.
Johnny Suede is at times more mannerism than meaning, but it still has a
bravura aimlessness. When most about 'nothing' - Johnny earning a few
daytime cents as a painter-decorator, Johnny daydreaming of an audience of
screaming girl fans as he stands on stage crooning about the beauty of
suede, Johnny musing malapropistically about girls ('That's the way I'm
handling this one, strictly Plutonic') - it is about everything. It is about
the way we live, moving in and out of consciousness, feeding our fantasies,
dreaming dreams, and making career plans that seldom leave the drawing-board
except to dive straight into the waste-paper bin.
Tom DiCillo's movie won the Golden Leopard for best film at last year's
Locarno Film Festival. Stuck in a one-lake Swiss town you might have voted
for it yourself - and suspected your vote was one for desperation. But what
seems at times to be last-gasp mannerist minimalism, fin de siecle style,
seems at others like a brave fluidity made for the next millennium. Johnny
Suede is minor in key but messianic in import.
There have been several rumoured sightings of Norman Wisdom over the 25
years since he retired from movie comedy. But some believe, like myself,
that they are apocryphal; that the man who bestrode 1950s British cinema
with his bicycle cap, ill-fitting jacket and braying pathos was put in a
time capsule long ago together with Muffin the Mule and Lonnie Donegan.
Now he has been taken out again, and hooray. I enjoyed him in Double X, a
colourfully appalling thriller in which Norman plays a runaway
scientist-inventor pursued by the criminal mob he invented things for. Just
what he invented is obscure. Perhaps it was the rabid-ferret hair dye and
stage Irish accent sported by Bernard Hill or the Michael Gambon
impersonation kit deployed by Mr Ward.
This cheerful rubbish was directed by Shani Grewel. No one seems to have any
idea what he or she is doing - she being Gemma Craven as gangland's answer
to Shanghai Lily - except for our Norman. He just carries on happily,
gasping, giggling, groaning, where The Bulldog Breed and A Stitch In Time
left off. Two decades in a time capsule teach one the wisdom of serenely,
stoically doing one's own thing.
'Sometimes you gotta get out and honk your own horn' says Dolly Parton as an
agony aunt in Straight Talk. Playing Chicago's riposte to Claire Rayner, she
hurls motherly advice over the airwaves after stumbling into WNDY Radio as a
prospective switchboard girl and being mistaken for the new phone-in hostess
who fails to turns up. (Why? We are never told.)
Meanwhile, in another part of the movie, a plausible romantic lead has
failed to turn up and the part goes to fidgety, semi-crazed James Woods of
Salvador. He and Miss Parton bill and coo at each other over that surging
outcrop known as Miss P's bosom, Woods playing a reporter out to expose her
imposture. Will she be exposed? Or will he fall for the impostress?
This is Hollywood at its most amiably confused. There are enough loose ends
in the film to harness up a team of chariots. Why, for instance, is the
subplot infatuation with our heroine of radio producer Griffin Dunne not
resolved? Dunne is the funniest thing here: executive stress written into
every twitch of the hand, every palpitation of that boil-in-the-bag face.
But he is fast marginalised by writers Craig Bolotin and Patricia Resnick
and director Barnet Kellman, who know where the money is. In a film starring
Dolly Parton, a competition-destroying landmark, what chance does a mere
good actor have to feature in the scenery?
At the ICA you may catch a new, uncut print of Walerian Borowczyk's The
Beast (La Bete). This is the film that had a thousand Aunt Ednas calling for
intensive care when it appeared in the mid-1970s. It is the tale of two
beautiful heiresses wrestling with two well-equipped monsters in two
different centuries (18th and 20th). L'erotisme fou, painted with the bright
unshockable wit that this Polish-born director brought to Blanche and
Immoral Tales.
Elsewhere in the cinemas the rewards are for those who search. My customary
advice in the silly season, which has now arrived in Britain with all its
luggage, is to indulge in Creative Filmgoing. A visit to the movies is not
contingent upon the week's new releases. Repertory cinemas abound, from
London's ICA, Electric Cinema and National Film Theatre to the regional film
theatres across the land.
Nor is multiple-choice programming confined to the art-house sector. The
boldest recent initiative has been that of the Prince Charles cinema where
for Pounds 1.20 per ticket - astonishing but true - you can choose among 20
new or classic films shown within a single week: The Prince Of Tides, Cyrano
De Bergerac, Apocalypse Now, Father Of The Bride, Bugsy . . .

FT  11 JUN 92 / Arts: Pond Life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALASTAIR MACAULAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'This is the best summer of my life - I wish I had it all on videocassette.'
With these words Pond Life, a new play by Richard Cameron, begins. The seven
characters are just kids, and their talk is just kids' talk. The first scene
gets nowhere slowly, and the play seems a drab example of garden-shed
theatre - except that it hardly seems to be a play. Then the tone changes
with successive scenes, and the play becomes absorbing, funny and moving -
except that it hardly seems to be a play.
Pond Life, a play about adolescence, is extraordinarily real, and it is
beautifully heightened by a young cast who are mainly still of school age.
(From the programmes biographies; 'Isobel was a member of the Actors'
Workshop in Halifax, and is currently sitting her A levels . . . She has the
option of working at the National Theatre of Namibia, before applying to
Drama School.') You don't expect teenage actors to be able to catch the
minor and major pangs of teenage existence as vividly as this. That they do
must be thanks to superb direction from Simon Usher. Anthony Lamble's
designs miraculously create four large and contrasting locales out of the
tiny Bush stage.
The play exists on some surprising cusp between The Three Sisters and The
Secret Diary of Adrian Mole. A critic's job is to report; but to describe
most of what goes on here would be to break its spell. Five of the seven
characters are interested in fishing: hence the title. You see one slightly
retarded girl, Pogo, going through an astonishing mad scene, you see
bullying and flirtation and heartbreak, and yet the climax occurs when three
characters catch a carp.
Pogo, by far the hardest role, is the only part which makes you aware of
acting. Though Joanna Robinson catches the fluctuations and pace of the
character's behaviour with perfect naturalness, she slightly overdoes the
wide-eyed ingenuousness and high white voice of innocence. Other players
include Lyndon Davies, remembered as a child actor in The Singing Detective
on TV and as two young Plantagenet princes with the RSC in 1988-89; here he
is a Yorkshire scamp fascinated by all the usual things - girls, boys,
masturbation, teasing and, yes, fishing.
Joe Duttine achieves the plays's most hilarious moment on his first
entrance. A pretty young thug with a tattoo and an earring, he comes in
sourly with his girlfriend, lies down importantly on some concrete - and
then says 'Think I'm gonna get me 'air cut.' The play leaves you wanting to
know more about him and Cassie (Isobel Raine). They are the two who are so
caught up in important adult things that they don't have time for fishing;
and you come to feel that is their loss. As Trevor, the chief fisherman and
most adult character, Richard Standing is moving in the play's simplest
moments.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Arts: Dark Elegies - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Ballet du Rhin broke the run of its charming Fille mal gardee on Tuesday
and Wednesday with a triple bill of more modern works. I wish the programme
had allowed us a more flattering view of the troupe, but after showing that
the company could deal well with a masterpiece (Dark Elegies), we were faced
with a gadarene rush into fatuity and unflattering choreography in stagings
by Claude Brumachon and Oscar Araiz.
Antony Tudor made Dark Elegies in 1937, and it was a prophetic work.
Mahler's Kindertotenlieder were to become terribly apt in the war years, and
to our shame, they are still more pertinent today. Tudor's language turns a
community's agonies into ritual that never dulls the pain of parental loss,
and the Ballet du Rhin interpretation has the austerity, the avoidance of
overt sentiment, that Tudor demanded in performance of his work. I think
that Dark Elegies would strike most terribly home were its soloists to be
great dancers who sternly repressed their feelings but we cannot hope for
such casting, and the present artists' simplicity, their sense of
responsibility to the text, is pleasingly honest. If the text itself differs
from the old Ballet Rambert version we knew for many years, it yet remains
the most powerful expression of grief that dance has yet given us, and the
Ballet du Rhin do not betray it.
Just what Claude Brumachon's Hawk's Lament' expresses I could not fathom.
Three women in long dresses leaned backwards and postured. Four men, in
revealingly tattered garb, entwined themselves. An attractive score by
Christopher Zurfluh made mediaeval noises. The stage was not over-lit. There
were frenetic slappings and brief, anxious gestures. Nothing else happened -
neither well-organised dance nor discernibly rational activity. The curtain
fell. Swift ingestion of alcohol is the only cure.
Not even alcohol, though, could numb the awfulness of Oscar Araiz' version
of The Carnival of the Animals. How it is possible to stage Saint-Saens'
witty, charming, infinitely felicitous score without a single atom of its
many virtues rubbing off on to the dance, I do not know, but Mr Araiz has
succeeded. He is aided and abetted by a witless barrage of rhymed couplets
that introduce each animal, spoken on Tuesday with great good humour by
Adrian Edmondson, who deserved danger-money for having to memorise so much
bad verse. Mr Edmondson was also the most entertaining mover on stage, the
choreography for the large cast condemning them to actions foolish,
inordinately dull.
The Ballet du Rhin continues at Sadler's Wells with its version of La Fille
mal gardee until June 13. The visit is made possible by the Association
Francaise d'Action Artistique and the Opera du Rhin.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Japan loses its yen
for Paris - Why Europe's luxury goods makers are having a tough time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There was a time in the late 1980s when Japanese tourists were buying so
many quilted leather bags at the Chanel shop on Rue Cambon in Paris that
Chanel was forced to 'ration' them to three per person. Unabashed, the
Japanese lurked outside, bribing passers-by to buy more bags for them.
Chanel is not the only European company to have benefited from the Japanese
lust for western luxury goods. In the 1980s, Japan emerged as the fastest
growing market for European fashion, perfume and cosmetics, thanks to the
apparently insatiable appetite of Japanese consumers for Hermes scarves,
Louis Vuitton luggage and Gianni Versace clothes.
Japan's recent economic problems - tumbling corporate profits, plunging
share prices and the precarious property market - present a depressing
scenario for Europe's fashion and beauty groups. The economic squeeze has
already affected their sales in Japan itself and to Japanese tourists in
other countries. The Europeans are now anxiously trying to assess the
long-term impact on one of their most important markets.
The catalysts for Japan's emergence as an important source of sales for
European fashion and beauty brands were economic growth and the increasingly
cosmopolitan attitude of Japanese consumers who were travelling more widely
and becoming more receptive to western trends.
These influences were accentuated by the frenetic growth of Japan's property
and stock markets. This created a new group of nouveau riche consumers,
happy to spend their new-found profits on Cartier jewels and Gucci shoes.
The property boom also priced the established middle classes out of the
housing market. Young couples were forced to postpone purchasing their own
homes, leaving them with more to spend on themselves.
Clarins, the French skincare company, sells more each year from a single
counter at the Isetan department store in the Shinjuku area of Tokyo than in
some of the smaller European countries. Paul Smith, the London menswear
designer, depends on Japan for nearly two-thirds of his turnover.
LVMH, the French luxury goods group behind Louis Vuitton, makes more than a
quarter of its sales in Japan. And Japanese tourists account for a fifth of
the sales of some products, such as perfume, at the Printemps department
store in Paris. 'Japan is incredibly important in sales terms,' says
Susannah Hardy, luxury goods analyst at Bacot Allain Warburg in Paris. 'It
is even more important in terms of profits because the margins on products
sold there are so high.'
Times have changed. The boom in the property and stock markets fizzled out
two years ago. The first products to suffer were the most expensive  - the
Impressionist paintings and opulent jewels. Cartier, one of the most
prestigious Paris jewellers, saw its Japanese sales slip by 12 per cent last
year.
Until recently, more mundane luxuries, French perfumes and Italian designer
clothes, were unaffected. But the recent run of Japan's economic problems
has depressed consumer confidence. Sales in department stores, the main
outlets for European fashion and beauty products, fell by 2 per cent in
April compared with the same month last year. The Japanese have also cut
back on international travel, thereby reducing 'souvenir' sales to tourists.
'It is too soon to say what will happen,' says Philippe Vadon, president of
the Japanese subsidiary of L'Oreal, the French cosmetics group. 'So far, all
we have seen is a slowdown in the extraordinary rate of growth, experienced
in the late 1980s. Remember, in Japan last year, our Lancome brand grew by
30 per cent.'
Serge Rosinoer, chief executive of Clarins, agrees. Clarins' Japanese sales
rose by 20 per cent in the first quarter of this year, compared with the 30
per cent Rosinoer would have expected had the economy been healthier.
So far, the slowdown has not been too severe. Moreover, the strength of the
yen in the first quarter has helped to offset any reduction in growth.
However, the Japanese slowdown comes at a time when European fashion and
beauty groups are already under pressure in other markets, notably the US.
There is also concern that the situation in Japan will deteriorate. The
worst scenario would be a repetition of 1974-75 when the economy sank into
recession, savings ratios rose and consumer spending collapsed. 'In the
past, the Japanese have responded to recession by saving more and spending
less,' says Claude Meyer, chief economist at Bank of Tokyo in Paris. 'We
just don't know yet whether that will happen again this time.'
These problems are aggravated by the changes in Japanese consumption
patterns. Even before the economic squeeze, the Japanese were becoming more
discerning in their choice of western goods. The old era, when wealthy
consumers seemed willing to buy just about anything with a glitzy European
label, has ended.
'The Japanese are now more mature, discriminating consumers,' says Peter
Wallis, a specialist in luxury goods at SRU, the London-based management
consultancy. 'They have travelled more widely and are more knowledgeable
about what they are buying. They want a wider choice and they want quality.'
Louis Vuitton's experience bears this out. It began in Japan by selling its
signature luggage with 'LV' initials stamped all over the leather. Its range
has now widened and the fastest-growing line in Japan is the more discreet
cuir epi collection. 'The Japanese are looking for quality and price,' says
Emmanuel Prat, president of LVMH in Japan. 'Image is not enough any more.'
In theory, this may make it more difficult for European companies to sell to
Japan. Wallis suspects it will certainly make life more difficult for less
prestigious brands which may be squeezed out of the market.
Meanwhile the established players are waiting to see whether the Japanese
economy worsens. Their problem is that there is little they can do to
mitigate the situation. Most accept that Japan is a complex market,
demanding long-term commitment. They are reluctant to jeopardise their
investment in research and distribution by adopting the conventional,
counter-recessionary tactics - price-cutting, accelerating product launches
or reducing promotional budgets - they might employ in other countries.
'We are talking about a very, very important market,' says Rosinoer. 'We
cannot run the risk of damaging our position by adopting short-term
strategies. Whatever happens, we will sit it out because we are in Japan for
the long-term.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Putting customers in
the picture - Kodak is projecting a new image
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kodak has the kind of marketing problem most companies would envy - a brand
name that is so well known that it overshadows all of its products.
When people hear the Kodak name, they think of photography, as they have
done for more than a century. Kodak has one of the strongest brand names in
the world along with Coca-Cola and Sony. That is great when Kodak is selling
camera film, but not so good when it wants to be taken seriously as a
supplier of high-tech office equipment.
Kodak is up against competitors like Xerox, with a brand name synonymous
with photo-copiers, and Canon, the Japanese group. Among 'business decision
makers', only one in five associates Kodak with photo-copying while three
out of four link the Rank Xerox name to office copying equipment. Similar
figures emerge for Kodak's other office equipment products, which range from
digital cameras and document scanners to optical disk storage systems and
high volume colour copier-duplicators.
Kodak's commercial customers consistently give its products - most of which
have high price tags - good marks for reliability and service, but the
problem is that existing customers are few in number.
Kodak's executives acknowledge the brand image problem. The company's
traditional photographic market is under attack from other competitors like
Japan's Fuji Film, making the move into office equipment all the more
important.
Mike Mansell, head of Kodak Office Imaging in the UK, says that although
most business people have personal experience of Kodak's photographic
products, those who influence decisions 'do not really associate Kodak with
the business environment'.
Mansell believes that some of Kodak's consumer advertising, like last year's
campaign featuring disposable cameras, 'may be seen as relatively flippant'
by business customers.
In the past, Kodak has tried 'umbrella' advertising to emphasise the broad
range of its businesses and overcome this commercial credibility gap.
However, the group recognises that it faces a marketing challenge and not
just an advertising problem: a radical response was needed.
First, Kodak has redefined its core business around the 'imaging' banner - a
concept that links traditional photography and the digital technologies
which dominate the office equipment market. By doing this, Kodak hopes its
brand name will become linked to the imaging expertise it employs in
scanners, optical disks and printers, and not just in consumer photography.
As a first step, Mansell says that Kodak must change its internal image,
'the one we have of ourselves,' and project the new image consistently.
Second, the group structure has been reorganised into three divisions -
imaging, which includes both photographic products and business equipment,
chemicals and health. One aim has been to shorten lines of communication,
ensuring that functions such as research and development, marketing and
customer service are better co-ordinated.
The reorganisation is also meant to simplify the management of customer
accounts and encourage sales representatives to listen more closely to
customers' needs.
The formation of Kodak Office Imaging, for example, brought together
businesses which previously operated as distinct units, sometimes even in
competition with each other. Now customer databases, long acknowledged as
one of the most powerful marketing tools, have been merged and only one
Kodak sales rep will call on customers in future instead of two. Mansell
says the new structure has already resulted in 'some enormous new (sales)
opportunities', although he adds that it will take time to change customer
perceptions.
Time is not on Kodak's side. The company is under pres- sure to sort out its
marketing quickly in order to halt a succession of poor results including a
19 per cent drop in 1992 first quarter net earnings.
The success of this latest reorganisation, the fifth since 1983, and Kodak's
attempts to develop its commercial brand image, will be critical to its
future. Mansell says Kodak will not be 'throwing money at advertising'.
Instead it is attempting to deal with the technical problems its customers
are facing. 'It is going to take a great deal of effort and commitment on
our part, but if we don't do it, we will be losing a great opportunity.'

IT MAY not look like a chicken, or even taste like a chicken, but in one
crucial respect - its thermal characteristics - it acts like a chicken.
Nestling discreetly among the chilled foods in Marks &amp; Spencer's in-store
refrigerators is a new breed of poultry that will never reach the nation's
dinner plates but is a classic example of how food hygiene - and
productivity demands - are driving equipment development.
The so-called Plastic Chicken, developed by M&amp;S in partnership with Elm, a
Scottish-based electronics company, was designed partly with the new UK food
safety regulations in mind, which will require chilled food to be kept at 5
deg C. But M&amp;S increasingly wants to hold chilled food at as low a
temperature as possible without freezing it, to incorporate an ever-wider
range of fresh food into its dishes.
In the past, says Nick Holloway, M&amp;S senior food technologist, monitoring
fridge temperatures involved time-consuming reading of thermometers placed
in various positions on the refrigerator shelves. These, however, measure
the temperature of the air rather than that of the product. M&amp;S wanted to go
direct to the product temperature for greater accuracy.
The solution was the Plastic Chicken, which incorporates a partially
insulated and damped temperature probe replicating the temperature
characteristics of a chicken or, with adjustments, a range of other chilled
foods.
The battery-operated chicken takes a temperature reading every minute, then
puts an average temperature into its memory every 15 minutes up to a maximum
of 10 days, or a maximum of six months if less frequent readings are taken.
If the temperature exceeds preset limits, the Chicken alarm lights
discreetly - no clucking.
Data from the first generation Plastic Chickens, which will be in all 280
M&amp;S stores by the end of July, are transferred by infra-red beam to a
hand-held reader unit held up to three feet away.
But M&amp;S has now hit on the idea of putting mini-transmitters in each chicken
linked to a receiving station in the store's food office, further increasing
the cost savings on collecting temperature data and improving vigilance.
The radio system can be retrofitted to the original Plastic Chickens, says
Holloway, and will probably be introduced next year. It gives 'battery hens'
a whole new meaning.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Technology: New recipes for cleanliness - The food industry
is discovering ways to ensure its equipment stays spick and span
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Take a beer from your fridge on a sticky day this summer and the chances are
that condensation will quickly form on the bottle. It is an effect that may
be harmless in the home but causes serious problems for the brewers.
At the Stella Artois brewery in Leuven, the Belgian equivalent of
Burton-on-Trent, they know all about condensation. Stella's light beers have
to be stored at low temperatures for several weeks before bottling, and
condensation quickly forms on storage vessels, pipework and cold wall
surfaces when ambient air - particularly on humid summer days - infiltrates
the buildings.
Condensation, combined with high humidity, provides ideal conditions for
mould and bacteria to grow, and frequent cleaning simply introduces more
water that exacerbates the problem. In 1978 Stella sought a solution through
installing dehumidifiers, but these weren't up to the job, and also used a
process that caused corrosion.
Now the Belgian brewer believes it has the problem licked with powerful
dehumidifiers that recirculate the air after passing it through a desiccant
rotor. The equipment, made by Swedish-owned Munters, removes excess moisture
from the air and prevents condensation.
'There are several similar situations in the UK, but also a need to make
companies aware of the possible solutions,' says Tim O'Brien, UK managing
director of Munters. 'Across the whole of the food industry, they are only
just starting to pick this up.'
Hygiene is a sensitive issue in the food and drink industry. Few producers
want to talk about a persistent problem or potential hazard until it is
ironed out. Perfection is not attainable, as recent Salmonella and Listeria
incidents have shown, but technology is making further improvements
possible.
Health scares have forced food producers and their suppliers, whether of
equipment or raw materials, to accept - sometimes reluctantly - that hygiene
is higher up the public agenda for food than it has been in the industry's
own priorities, where over the past 20 years issues such as productivity and
efficiency have held sway.
For food and drink equipment suppliers, this creates both an opportunity to
develop new techniques where solving a hygiene problem is the major issue,
but also a challenge to redesign equipment that, in hygiene terms, is now
past its sell-by date.
Solving hygiene problems has long been important for the food industry,
although primarily as a means to an end - greater productivity. More
recently, equipment suppliers and customers have realised that combinations
of mechanical equipment, control systems and packaging technologies can be
used to create a marketing opportunity through overcoming a hygiene
obstacle.
Marks &amp; Spencer, for example, has developed a New Zealand chilled lamb
business to replace chilled English lamb in the winter when eating quality
becomes too variable. Apart from careful selection of the carcasses, the
business relies crucially on computerised systems to control temperatures on
the 35-40 day voyage from New Zealand, says Martin van Zwanenberg, M&amp;S
divisional director for foods.
However, it is the production processes between shipping of the raw
materials and delivery of the finished product to the shops where hygiene is
most important. But the challenges are less understandable to the layman and
often more difficult for the industry to solve.
As food manufacturing equipment has become bigger and more complex, the
processes used are increasingly akin to those of a chemical plant and less
like a scaled-up version of a kitchen. The combination of nutrients, water
and heat in a continuous production process creates a 'fertile atmosphere'
for bacteria, according to Terry Tamplin, marketing manager at APV Baker.
Over the past 20 years, in response to customers' needs to keep expensive
capital equipment running longer, UK-based APV and the other big equipment
suppliers such as Sweden's Alfa-Laval have installed clean-in-place (CIP)
systems. Now, few large food producers would even look at equipment that
cannot be cleaned in place, or where parts that do have to be removed for
cleaning cannot be re-assembled quickly.
In this environment, hygiene problems occur when even high-pressure CIP
fails to work, often because of poor hygienic design of equipment.
The 1990 Richmond Report on the Microbiological Safety of Food quoted cases
where poor design had caused food poisoning incidents. Even the fastidious
M&amp;S was hit by a Salmonella outbreak on vol-au-vents 10 years ago when
chicken built up in a processing machine that incorporated CIP.
Incidents like that are prompting a big co-operative effort by customers and
equipment suppliers to emphasise design for cleaning - without losing out on
efficiency and productivity.
Nooks and crannies where food can collect are being designed out, says
Tamplin, and stainless steel used increasingly for ease of cleaning. Valves
 -notoriously difficult to clean, says van Zwanenberg - are being used only
when absolutely necessary.
Increasingly, equipment is being totally redesigned, principally for hygiene
reasons. At Hoyer, Alfa-Laval's ice-cream equipment subsidiary, the latest
Straightline extrusion machine is designed with sloping surfaces, no
overlaps where ice cream can collect, and a freezing tunnel built like a
stainless steel tank with invisible welds.
The extruders have to be removed for cleaning but can be reassembled
quickly, says John Weaver, marketing manager. 'The aim is to make it as easy
as possible, so that the operators don't cut corners.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / Accountancy Column: Annual fee income rankings - growth
rates sharply down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY CRITICISE it, they disdain it, they publicly dismiss it. But privately
all the accountancy firms eagerly await the release of the annual fee income
rankings, keen as they are to see their own position and to crunch the
numbers of their competitors.
This year more than any in recent memory, the data warrant close attention
for the picture they paint of the impact of recession. Gloomy trends emerge
from the numbers and changes in staff and partner employment, revenues from
clients, and the other limited information reluctantly handed out by the
firms.
The Financial Times' table of the largest 25 firms reveals a year of
enormous change, with growth rates sharply down from the late 1980s, some
figures in absolute decline, and several changes in the rankings of the
different firms.
Four of the top 25 accounting practices reported an absolute decline in fee
income this year, and only four managed to achieve the double-digit growth
which was typical even last year. Most have struggled to keep up with
inflation.
Between them, the firms closed at least 18 branch offices around the country
over the past year, and cut more than 3,400 professional jobs, and nearly
100 partners. These figures disguise larger numbers of job losses, which
have been off-set by other people who have been hired.
One of the biggest surprises is Coopers &amp; Lybrand. It remains the largest
firm by fee income, but fell to Pounds 577m. The firm dropped Deloitte from
the end of its name at the start of the month, but the legacy of its merger
with Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells in 1990 lives on in the figures.
The firm readjusted the Pounds 588m it quoted last year down to Pounds 580m,
arguing that it over-estimated the income it would receive from the
Deloitte's side of the business. That still means it has declined by 0.52
per cent.
The largest drop came from Chantrey Vellacott, in which the fee income fell
by 4.55 per cent. BDO Binder Hamlyn also fell sharply, down by 4.43 per
cent, while Neville Russell declined by 1.18 per cent.
Seven of the top 20 firms changed position in the FT's league table,
compared with their ratings last year. BDO Binder Hamlyn, and Grant Thornton
 -the two firms just below the 'big six' - have switched places. So have
Stoy Hayward with Moores Rowland; and Neville Russell with Moore Stephens.
MacIntyre Hudson, which refused to provide any information this year, has
dropped off the list entirely. It has almost certainly seen a substantial
drop in fee income after its City of London practice de-merged last year.
Two exceptions to the generally gloomy trend are Arthur Andersen and Touche
Ross. Andersen grew by 23 per cent, a large proportion of which can be
attributed to the highly successful consulting division. But the firm also
boasts the best growth rates for both the accounting and insolvency
divisions among the large firms.
Touche Ross also bucked the trend with fee growth of 15.72 per cent. That
includes substantial contributions from referral work from its international
partnership - which includes former Deloitte practices - along with European
consulting and the liquidation of the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
Among the smaller firms, Levy Gee also performed extremely well, with growth
up by 10.71 per cent. That reflects the firm's particular strength in
insolvency, which contributed 40 per cent of income this year.
As always, the figures come with substantial provisos. It is difficult to
analyse the break-down within the four quoted divisions - accountancy,
audit, tax and insolvency - because work is often distributed differently
between the categories by different firms.
Not all the year-ends correspond, and some are estimates to help make
comparisons rather than the year-ends used by the firms. None of the figures
are audited.
At least two firms adopt the questionable practice of including their
associate firms around the country. Others have made adjustments to previous
years' data, and several have added in contributions from offices in the
Channel Islands and the Isle of Man which were excluded in the past.
'I really think it is high time that outsiders were allowed to come in and
inspect the books of the firms,' says Mr Hugh Aldous, national managing
partner of Robson Rhodes, who pours scorn on their reliability.
Other partners, especially those in firms with falling growth rates, argue
that profitability is far more important than income. But unless they
provide this information, they must expect speculation about their financial
health to continue.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour plays downdivisions on
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR yesterday disguised its internal divisions over the Maastricht treaty
by keeping open all its options if the government tries to press ahead with
ratification.
After an at times heated debate at the weekly meeting of the parliamentary
party, MPs voted by an overwhelming show of hands to remit three diverging
proposals on strategy, allowing the shadow cabinet to prepare a new position
for presentation next week.
While the vote risked Conservative charges that Labour is as undecided as
the government on how to react to the Danish referendum result, it served to
maintain an appearance of party unity.
The compromise was widely seen as a short-term tactical victory for the
party leadership, which had initially responded to a demand from Mr Tony
Benn for a British referendum by tabling an ambiguous amendment.
Its wording, drawn up by Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary,
argued that while the Maastricht text fell far short of Labour's official
European Community policy on a number of issues, it also embraced many of
its goals.
Rather than indicating a clear strategy, the shadow cabinet's line merely
insisted that it would be 'improper' for parliament to continue the
ratification process until the Community had decided a clear way forward.
In consequence, the leadership's amendment fell a long way short of an
alternative amendment tabled by Mr Peter Hain, the Tribunite MP for Neath.
His proposal, reportedly attracting growing support from many quarters in
the party, criticised the Maastricht accord for its narrowly monetarist
criteria for economic and monetary union and called for outright Labour
opposition to ratification.
Urging support for the leadership's amendment, Mr Neil Kinnock, the party
leader, praised Mr Hain's goals and in an implicit rebuke for Mr Benn argued
that 'the days for semi-detachment' over Europe were over.
He went on to warn that parliamentary realities, including the possibility
that the Maastricht bill will not be resubmitted, meant it was important not
to 'tie the hands of the future leadership', to be elected on July 18.
When Mr David Blunkett, campaign manager for Mr Bryan Gould's leadership
challenge, argued for the remission of all three proposals he won
overwhelming support, although Mr Benn refused to withdraw his referendum
scheme.
Mr Benn insisted after the meeting that his efforts to win party support for
a plebiscite had had 'a good start' and would build before the party
conference.
Mr Hain claimed that while the parliamentary party clearly opposed the
referendum option, it was equally sceptical about the leadership's cautious
tactics. Praising the meeting's outcome as a 'unity position', he
nonetheless argued that the momentum was now gathering behind his stance of
firm opposition to the treaty terms.
Radical Labour party members were pro-European but opposed to a 'bankers'
vision' of Europe, he said.
In Strasbourg this week, Mr John Smith, now all but certain to be the next
Labour leader, appeared to be giving some ground to Mr Gould's position by
emphasising the need for more democratic accountability in the EC.
While repeating his own firm support for Labour's qualified backing for the
Maastricht accord, he also made clear that it should pursue with its sister
socialist parties an economic strategy 'based on sustainable growth and the
highest possible levels of employment.'
Nonetheless, Labour is clearly tiptoeing towards a position where it can
make common cause with the Tory rebels and vote comfortably against the
government without drawing charges of political opportunism. The aim is to
maximise Conservative unease without putting its own unity at risk in the
process.

</HEADLINE>

THE government raised the prospect of a reduction in the rate of corporation
tax to 20 per cent for small companies yesterday, following its policy of
aligning the levy with the standard rate of income tax.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said such a move
might be possible, under questioning from Mr Chris Smith, a Labour
frontbench Treasury spokesman.
Mr Smith had asked for an indication of the government's future plans on
corporation tax, since it appeared to be its intention to expand the 20p
income tax band introduced in the last budget until it became effectively
the standard rate.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Review of 'cosy' travel facility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME MPs are not taking kindly to the prospect of having their travel
arrangements made by a German-owned tour operator.
It emerged yesterday that the all-party Commons administration committee is
likely to review 'as an early priority' an arrangement whereby the Palace of
Westminster's transport office has been operated exclusively since 1985 by
Thomas Cook.
The travel company was bought from Midland Bank last week for Pounds 200m by
LTU, Germany's third-biggest package tour operator.
Mr Brian Wilson, Labour MP for Cunninghame North, whose written question led
to the statement that a review was on the cards, said the takeover had
prompted the timing of his question. 'It does seem a cosy arrangement,' he
said.
According to Mr Alan Beith, the Liberal Democrat MP who answered on behalf
of the House of Commons Commission in charge of administration, the original
four-year agreement with Thomas Cook had been extended indefinitely, with
the recommendation that the arrangement be 'fully reviewed' within 12 months
of the start of the present parliament. It was expected that the
administration committee would be 'invited to initiate that review as an
early priority'.
Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend East and a prominent Euro-sceptic,
said it was vital that the contract should be placed immediately for public
tender. 'There is always the possibility that a British-owned firm might be
successful,' he said.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Straw softens hostility to
grant-maintained schools
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A marked post-election shift in education policy, the Labour party
significantly softened its hostility to opted-out schools yesterday and
raised the possibility of local referenda to determine the future shape of
education provision.
Mr Jack Straw, shadow education secretary, described opting out as 'an
essentially anarchic process', but warned that Labour should 'not appear to
be placed in a hostile position' to parents making decisions about the best
future for their children.
Labour used its first education policy statement since the election to call
on local education authorities to adopt an evenhanded approach in their
dealings with grant-maintained schools.
The party reiterated its opposition to opting out, saying it would reduce
parental choice, disrupt management and result in the reintroduction of
'selection by the back door'.
It advised local education authorities (LEAs) to summon conferences of head
teachers 'urgently' to discuss 'whether an approach can be agreed with all
schools in their area'.
Labour opposed moves in some LEAs for secondary schools to opt out as a
group, emphasising its commitment to changing the role of the LEA from that
of provider 'to that of facilitator and enabler for the consumers - parents,
students and pupils'.
Labour envisages a new contract between education authorities and schools,
by which councils would provide services - such as transport and in-service
training - on a contractual basis to a 'mixed economy' of church, opted-out,
and independent schools in their area.
'The elected member will become less a manager of services and much more an
advocate for the community,' the party says.
Only 240 of the 25,000 schools in England and Wales are grant-maintained,
but with the future of opting-out assured, a rapid increase in parental
ballots on opting out is expected.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, welcomed Labour's 'capitulation' over
opting-out. 'It has been persuaded by thousands of parents, teachers and
school governors voting with their feet and taking their schools out of the
stranglehold of local education authority control,' he said.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Boundary commission test looms for
Kinnock
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NEIL KINNOCK and the Labour leadership face a backbench revolt over their
plans not to oppose the first stage of the boundary commission legislation
in next Monday's debate.
Last night the shadow cabinet agreed the party should not vote against the
bill next week, but should make its points through amendments at the
committee stage.
The bill sets new statutory deadlines for completing reviews of boundaries
and introduces more frequent studies. That would change constituency
boundaries before the next general election, a move expected to benefit the
Conservatives.
The Labour frontbench argument for not opposing the measure next week is
that there have to be boundary reviews because it is undeniable that the
population has moved. The Opposition's task is to ensure that the
legislation prevents the government from manipulating the process.
Backbench rebels are planning to force a vote on Monday, and may try to
carry out guerrilla tactics in the bill's later stages. Because it counts as
a constitutional measure, the convention is that the government would not
curtail debate, and that the bill would take up the time of the Commons
itself instead of being considered by a committee.
The move comes against a background of discontent from Labour spokesmen and
backbenchers that Opposition parliamentary tactics have not yet proved
particularly effective against the reduced Tory majority of 21.
Some MPs also recall angrily that Labour gave a relatively easy run to the
bill three years ago which extended the voting rights of expatriates.
Labour's estimates put the effect of the boundary commission reports between
a net gain for the party of four seats and a net loss of ten.
Mr John Prescott, a shadow cabinet member and a contender for Labour's
deputy leadership, said: 'Gerrymandering is an ugly word for a very ugly and
anti-democratic manipulation of people's right to a fair election.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / Clarke signals further review of police service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH CLARKE, home secretary, yesterday sketched out the framework of a
further examination of the police service only three weeks after announcing
a review of police career structures and pay issues.
The new study will cover a number of funding and structural issues.
Mr Clarke told the Association of Chief Police Officers conference in
Eastbourne, East Sussex, that the review - to be completed by next May  -
would go 'beyond narrow adjustments to existing structure and pay
arrangements' and examine officers' responsibilities, careers and
performance. But, added Mr Clarke, 'funding and wider structural issues'
must also be addressed. He was studying those and was likely to produce
proposals in due course.
Mr Clarke said after his speech that he had wanted to signal that matters of
funding and structure were on the agenda.
The forthcoming review of local government may affect the structure of
police authorities, whose boundaries often coincide with those of counties.
On funding, chief constables would like to be released from what they regard
as unduly rigid government control.
Mr Clarke told the conference that he attached great importance to changes
taking place in police management structure. Stripping out intermediate
levels of command and focusing on single, local management structures would
provide strong and visible leadership.
He said: 'I want to see well defined autonomy for local police chiefs and
proper support arrangements, including delegated budgets. This means shorter
chains of command in the service and a fresh look at many traditional posts.
It means new working arrangements for constables, sergeants and supervisory
ranks.'
However, Mr Clarke said, improving service quality alone would not increase
public confidence in the police and criminal justice system, which had been
damaged by a series of miscarriages of justice. There must never be
cover-ups and the police must accept valid criticism.
He warned that 'to a public which feels beset by and often fearful of
prevailing levels of crime', discretion was a vital ingredient in police
work.
'As many in the service learned years ago, discretion and tact rather than a
heavy-handed approach can work wonders on public confidence,' he said.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Tougher penalties sought for polluters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOUGHER penalties for industries that cause water pollution were proposed
yesterday by the Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution to help reverse
a 10-year decline in river quality in England and Wales.
It said in a report on freshwater quality, published yesterday, that the
improvement in river water between 1958 and 1980 had been followed by a
decade of deterioration.
It suggested that polluters - such as sewage treatment plants, industry and
farmers - should be charged according to the volume and polluting
characteristics of discharges, with the income used for pollution prevention
and research, and grants for pollution abatement.
In present National Rivers Authority schemes, polluters pay the cost of
monitoring to ensure they meet agreed discharge levels. They also pay
penalties for breaching them.
The commission's proposed charges would initially be set to raise similar
amounts to the authority's scheme - about Pounds 25m a year - but would be
progressively increased.
Lord Lewis the commission chairman, called for less reliance to be placed on
the ability of rivers to assimilate waste. Instead, technology should be
improved and public attitudes changed so that discharges of effluents into
rivers could be progressively reduced.
Among the report's 108 recommendations were a change in the way river
quality is monitored, focusing on the presence of plants and animals and a
range of pollutants, instead of just three chemicals as at present.
Reduction of phosphate discharges and action to reduce acid rain were also
urged.
Friends of the Earth, the environmental campaign group, said the report was
a 'litany of government neglect and mismanagement of Britain's lakes and
rivers'. It 'revisited problems that should have been tackled years ago'.
Other findings of the report were:
There is no national monitoring programme for groundwaters, which are often
'extensively' polluted by industrial solvents.
Rivers, lakes and reservoirs in most of central and southern England suffer
from high levels of phosphate, causing excessive growth of surface plants
and algae, which damages wildlife and causes difficulty for water users.
Acid rain is making rivers in some parts of Scotland, northern England and
Wales so acidic they are almost devoid of fish.
In 1990, one in eight sewage works was still not operating within its
discharge consents.
Pesticide pollution remains high, a factor sometimes reflected in drinking
water. In London, a six-month survey in 1989-90 found two thirds of samples
with pesticides above EC limits.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Minority targets for law firms 'unrealistic'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOLICITORS' firms in England and Wales are to be asked by the Law Society to
adopt targets for the number of ethnic minority lawyers they employ.
The general view among large City law firms yesterday was that the targets
were unrealistic. Firms with fewer than five fee earners (lawyers and legal
executives) will be excluded from strict compliance with the targets but are
to be asked to use all reasonable efforts to adopt the target set for small
firms.
Small firms - those with between five and 10 fee earners - are to be asked
to employ at least one fee earner from the ethnic minorities.
Medium-sized firms - 11 to 50 fee earners - have been set a target of one
ethnic minority trainee plus one other ethnic minority fee earner.
Firms with more than 50 fee earners are to be asked to take 10 per cent of
their trainees and 5 per cent of their other fee earners from the ethnic
minorities.
Although the targets are not mandatory, the society plans to enforce them
through the back door. From September, all firms wishing to take on trainees
will have to be licensed by the society. A condition of those licences will
be that firms comply with the society's policies.
Mr David Rance, personnel director of Freshfields, said the aim was
'laudable but totally impractical'.
Mr Charles Dodson, recruitment partner at Lovell White Durrant, said he
thought the targets might not be as drastic as they sounded. Most firms had
not collated statistics on the ethnic background of their employees in the
past and so had no idea how difficult it would be to comply.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Blacks feel squeeze at work / A look at how ethnic
minorities have slipped back in the jobs market during recession
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SURVEY of leading companies shows that only five of Ford Motor's 407
senior British managers are from ethnic minorities. At J. Sainsbury, with
97,000 employees, ethnic minorities account for 2 per cent of the
management.
Those figures may look unimpressive, but records of many other companies are
worse. At least Ford and Sainsbury answered the question - many
organisations taking part in the survey declined to break down their
employees and managers by ethnic origin.
'Even the largest employers do not take the steps necessary to ensure
equality of opportunity in their employment practices,' writes Dr Wilfred
Wood, bishop of Croydon, in a foreword to the survey report by the
Ecumenical Committee for Corporate Responsibility.
He should know. As a black bishop, Dr Wood is as unusual in the church
hierarchy as black people are among senior managers, high court judges,
vice-chancellors and the upper ranks of almost every walk of British public
life.
Britain's young blacks have depressingly few high-level role models to
aspire to. Not that they spend much time discussing the lack of black
bankers and bishops: they are more likely to be concerned with immediate job
prospects.
The Commission for Racial Equality's annual report yesterday drew attention
to the damage the recession is doing to attempts to increase ethnic minority
recruitment and promotion rates.
The commission had begun to hope that the combination of an expanding
economy and a declining number of young people in the population would
reduce the employment imbalance suffered by ethnic minorities. Unemployment
rates - double those of the white rate until the mid 1980s - declined to
about 60 per cent by the late 1980s. The gap is now widening again.
Research for the commission shows that 8 per cent of university students
come from ethnic minorities - broadly their proportion among young people as
a whole - while 16 per cent of the 1990 intake to polytechnics and colleges
was from ethnic minorities. But as the recession hits graduate recruitment,
there is a danger of black graduates' becoming another disillusioned group.
The commission's report on its work over the past year shows that Britain's
ethnic minorities face continuing difficulties in finding jobs and gaining
promotion.
An investigation into the hotel industry showed people from ethnic
minorities over-represented in unskilled jobs such as cleaning and portering
and under-represented in managerial and supervisory posts.
A study of lecturer appointments in Leicestershire further education
colleges found that only 1.2 per cent of lecturers came from Asian and
Afro-Caribbean backgrounds, although ethnic minorities constitute 11 per
cent of the county's population.
The commission is seeking talks with the government on promoting equal
opportunities policies through awarding of public contracts. Limited
opportunities for doing that already exist - local authorities can, under
the 1988 Local Government Act, question contractors, but many fail to do so.
The commission hopes that the government may eventually extend the positive
promotion of equal opportunity - the principle behind Northern Ireland's
Fair Employment Act - to race relations.
'We need to concentrate on outcomes and focus on the positive steps people
and organisations can take to improve equal opportunities,' says Ms Mary
Coussey, director of the commission's employment division.
Aside from the recession, some investigations suggest that straightforward
racism often remains a barrier to finding a job.
A study of young people in Liverpool, published by Liverpool University's
sociology and social policy department earlier this year, concluded that
young blacks were not obtaining equal rewards in the labour market when they
had the same qualifications as whites.
'There can be no doubt whatsoever that racism reduces blacks' chances in
Britain's labour markets,' the report concluded. The labour market, it
argued, was at the root of the black community's disadvantage, with those
young black people who had achieved in education 'mostly being pushed back'.
That, the report said, was taking place against a background where many
leading employers proclaimed the cause of equal opportunities but in reality
treated it as little more than a public-relations exercise.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Warning by race equality chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE emergence of neo-fascists in continental Europe, the racist posturing of
presidential aspirants in the US and the horrific events in Yugoslavia will
only add to the insecurity felt by Britain's ethnic minority community, Mr
Michael Day, chairman of the Commission for Racial Equality, said yesterday.
Mr Day said in the commission's annual report that ethnic minorities could
never feel totally secure when they witnessed oppression on racial grounds
elsewhere. Racial minorities in Britain saw how the stance of more liberal
politicians was adjusted to 'take account of the pressures from a Le Pen'.
It had caused alarm, Mr Day said, when 'the language of 'swamping' began to
seep back into the debate on refugees and asylum seekers in the apparent
need to placate those holding more racist views'.
Progress towards equality of opportunity for all in Britain was 'too slow
and too grudging', but the way in which institutions such as the police, the
churches, the law, health, education and housing were prepared to review
practices was encouraging.
There was general support for outlawing the most blatant and offensive
expressions of racism, but objections were raised 'the nearer we get to
challenging the vested interests of those in privileged positions'.
The commission was, Mr Day said, disappointed that an opportunity had been
missed to use the Citizen's Charter to give an explicit lead on ethnic
monitoring.
Policies of privatisation and devolved responsibility had reduced
opportunities for influence.
'As hospitals assume trust status, schools become locally managed,
vocational and enterprise training becomes the responsibility of Tecs
(training and enterprise councils) and Lecs (Scotland's local enterprise
companies), local-authority and central government services are contracted
out, what external authority is there to ensure they continue to be equal
opportunity employers?'

FT  11 JUN 92 / Government is accused over Hess records
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENSITIVE information about the abortive peace mission by Rudolf Hess,
Hitler's deputy, to the UK in 1941 is still being witheld by the government,
it was claimed yesterday.
That was in spite of the release yesterday of official records about Hess's
mysterious arrival in Renfrewshire and his subsequent captivity. The issuing
of documents was part of the government's efforts to reduce enduring
official secrecy over Hess's flight to the UK.
The documents included an apparent suicide note addressed to his family in
Germany a month after his arrival. The letter, together with a similar
message to Hitler, was written in June 1941 while Hess was being
interrogated by government and intelligence officials at Mytchett Place near
Aldershot.
Hess's letter to his family - in which he wrote despairingly, 'As I am
forced to end my life' - was confirmed yesterday by his son Mr Wolf-Rudiger
Hess.
The scrawled letters to Hitler and to his family - addressed as 'My Dear
All' - were referred to in a biography of Hess by Mr Peter Padfield that was
published last year. But Mr Padfield confirmed yesterday that this was the
first time the letters themselves and their content had come to light.
The four pages of letters were the only new documents brought to light in
yesterday's release of about 900 pages of microfilmed documents on the Hess
case by the Public Records Office. Other records published yesterday had
already been known to historians for several years, having been released
through other channels.
Mr John Costello, a former television producer who has pioneered research
into Hess's story using Soviet and US archives, complained that the
government was still withholding sensitive material.
Mr Costello said it was 'ludicrous' that information was coming out from the
files of both the US and the former Soviet Union that was still unavailable
in Britain.
Mr Padfield produced evidence in his book, Hess - Flight for the Fuhrer,
that Hess had been the victim of an elaborate decoy plot by British
intelligence. A 'double-cross' team had lured Hess to Britain by nurturing
his hopes of agreeing a deal with supporters of appeasement in the British
establishment.
Of yesterday's documents, Mr Padfield said: 'What is interesting is what is
not there.' He said he was 'quite convinced' that details of the MI6 plot
against Hess were contained in intelligence files separate from the UK
Foreign Office files now being opened to the public. The MI6 files would
remain secret after all the remaining Foreign Office files on Hess were due
to be released in the next few weeks, Mr Padfield said.
Mr Hess junior, speaking from near Munich, maintained his claims that his
father, who died in Spandau fortress in Berlin in 1987, was murdered by the
British authorities.
He called for full disclosure of the circumstances of his father's flight to
Britain. 'This would please the family as well as the historians,' he said.
'If it seems as if the British government is hiding something, this is
negative for Britain.'

THE BAR'S procedures for handling complaints against barristers were
criticised yesterday by the Legal Services Ombudsman for lack of

Mr Michael Barnes said in his first annual report that the Bar's procedures
were primarily disciplinary and often left complainants feeling they had
become minor players in the profession's internal disciplinary proceedings.
The Bar's professional conduct committee, which dealt with most complaints

<TEXT>
A GLOOMY assessment of the immediate future for local government was given
yesterday by Mr Howard Davies, outgoing chairman of the Audit Commission,
the local authority watchdog, Andrew Adonis writes.
Writing in the latest issue of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities
News, Mr Davies declares that in the wake of the poll tax debacle 'the
fiscal foundations of local government (are) too feeble to carry the weight
of service expenditure piled upon them.'
'Increasingly, councils are finding themselves in the position of agents,
administering government-designed programmes with relatively little
discretion to vary their content to suit local circumstances. That process
may well have further to go.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / Council swaps cases resume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FRESH attempt is being made to bring cases to court in order to establish
legal guidelines for resolving about 200 outstanding actions between banks
and local authorities arising out of the interest rates swaps debacle.
The House of Lords ruled in January last year that all swaps deals were
invalid because they had been outside councils' legal powers.
It left 80 banks facing losses of about Pounds 560m on swap transactions
with 130 councils. Their only recourse was to try to recover about a quarter
of their losses by suing councils for restitution of funds earned by writing
swap contracts.
Yesterday the High Court judge in charge of the litigation named another set
of lead cases to replace the original six, all of which have been settled
out of court.
Mr Justice Hirst said the outstanding litigation involved several dozen
banks and a greater number of local authorities. By far the most important
issue in all cases was whether the banks' claims for restitution were
legally sound.
He selected a claim by SG Warburg against Birmingham City Council, involving
more than Pounds 5m, as the principal leader on restitution, setting January
11 as the hearing date.
If that case is settled out of court, the lead role will be taken by
Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale, claiming Pounds 1.145m from the London
Borough of Islington, and Kleinwort Benson v Sandwell, in the West Midlands,
in which the claim is for more than Pounds 360,000.
The second main legal issue concerns intermediation - where a local
authority acted as an intermediary between a bank and another council.
Lead case on that issue will be Morgan Grenfell's Pounds 2m claim against
Welwyn Hatfield District Council.
The second-tier cases will be three actions by Chemical Bank against Welwyn
Hatfield, Sandwell and the London Borough of Richmond, involving claims of
Pounds 3m, Pounds 7m and Pounds 3.7m respectively, and claims by Kleinwort
Benson (nearly Pounds 1.6m) and Morgan Grenfell (Pounds 700,000) against
South Tyneside council.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Rover car output falls sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROVER car output fell heavily in the first quarter of this year, but UK
national output figures were boosted by higher production at Nissan and
small gains by Vauxhall and Ford.
Overall UK car output in the first three months of the year fell by 0.8 per
cent to 343,318 from 346,163 in the corresponding period a year ago,
according the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Rover car production fell by 14.4 per cent to 94,937, while output of the
Land Rover division's Range Rover and Discovery vehicles declined by 19.2
per cent to 9,346.
Rover slipped into fourth place in the new car sales league after being
overtaken for the first time by the Peugeot group of France, which includes
Citroen.
Rover car sales in the first three months were 32.1 per cent lower than in
the same period a year ago, compared with a fall of 11.1 per cent in the
overall UK new car market. Its market share fell to only 12.0 per cent from
15.7 per cent a year earlier.
It experienced a recovery in May, but for the first five months its sales
were still 20.9 per cent lower than a year before, although it regained
third place behind Ford and Vauxhall.
Output of Rover's ageing Maestro and Montego models was more than halved in
the first quarter, while production of its most popular Rover 200/400 range
declined by 16 per cent.
Among the loss-making UK specialist carmakers, Group Lotus, a subsidiary of
General Motors of the US, and Rolls-Royce Motor Cars, a subsidiary of
Vickers, the UK engineering group, continued to suffer a severe drop in
output.
THE number of vehicles in Britain rose by 0.6 per cent last year compared
with a rise of 2.6 per cent in 1990, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and
Traders said yesterday. The number of cars on the road rose 0.96 per cent to
22.7m, but the number of other vehicles fell - lorries by 9.4 per cent,
buses by 1.6 per cent, and motorcycles by 6.4 per cent.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Helicopter service bids referred
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the bids to take over British International Helicopters Ltd (BIHL),
Robert Maxwell's helicopter company now in administration, were yesterday
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Daniel Green writes.
Arthur Andersen, administrators of Maxwell's private companies, said the
decision would 'add to the uncertainty surrounding BIHL's future' and would
'have an adverse impact on the company's creditors.' The MMC has until
September 9 to make its ruling.
The referred bids, by Bond Helicopters and Bristow Helicopters, both UK
companies, would if successful reduce from three to two the number of
competitors in the North Sea helicopter services business.
If Bristow won control of BIHL's assets, it would have about 75 per cent of
the market, while if Bond won it would have nearly half.
It is understood that both the Office of Fair Trading and oil companies
operating in the North Sea objected to the bids.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Industrial action vote at Smiths

<TEXT>
UNIONS at Smiths Crisps are balloting on industrial action after the
company's decision to abandon national bargaining and all national union
agreements in favour of plant-level pay and agreements.
Mr Brian Revell, an official of the TGWU general union, said the decision
reflected the 'anti-union instincts' of Pepsico Food International, the US
food group which bought Smiths three years ago. He said it was probably the
prelude to derecognition of unions by the company.
Mr Tim Raven, operations director of Smiths Crisps, denied any plan to
derecognise unions but hinted that it might become an issue if the unions
disrupted the attempt to decentralise bargaining.
The other unions at Smiths - the GMB and Usdaw - are also holding a ballot.
The result will be known on June 19.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Auditing rules to be tightened
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACCOUNTANCY FIRMS will be forbidden from auditing the accounts of companies
for which they have valued brands, pension funds, property and other assets
under draft ethical rules released yesterday by their professional bodies.
The action was widely welcomed in submissions from accountancy firms and
other bodies received in advance of the guidelines, which were issued by the
chartered accountants joint ethics committee.
The committee represents the three Institutes of Chartered Accountants - in
England and Wales, in Scotland and in Ireland.
The guidelines state that a firm should not audit any valuation of a
significant size performed by the same firm or an associated practice where
the valuation would be incorporated into the accounts as either the firm's
or the directors' valuation.
Among firms likely to be affected is Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which conducted
brand valuation for companies includ-ing Mirror Group Newspapers while
acting as auditors.
Another draft guideline issued yesterday states that firms should refuse to
give a second opinion on contentious accounting issues to a company audited
by another firm, unless they are in full possession of the information on
the subject held by the auditor.
The guidelines follow identification by the ethics committee of a number of
instances of 'opinion shopping', by which companies have undermined the
authority of their auditors by going elsewhere for a more sympathetic ruling
from another accountancy firm not familiar with the issues involved.
Both sets of guidelines will now go before the councils of the three
institutes, and if accepted they should come into force by late December.
The ethics committee also yesterday launched a discussion paper on
'predatory pricing' by which firms under competitive pressure offer to
conduct audit work at substantially discounted rates. The practice has
raised doubts about the quality of auditing provided. It has drawn up three
possible options, ranging from leaving pricing decisions to the free market
to forbidding firms from bidding at below the direct labour costs of the
professionals employed on the contract.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Increase in business failures continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS failures continued to increase in the first three months of this
year, according to figures published yesterday by Trade Indemnity, the
credit insurance group, Bethan Hutton writes.
The group warned that any significant improvement in the rate of failures
would lag well behind any upturn in the economy.
Failures notified to the group rose to 2,074 in the first quarter, up 10 per
cent from the last quarter of last year.
The north was worst hit, with a 33 per cent rise in the first quarter. Also
badly affected were the south-west, the Yorkshire and Humberside area, and
the west Midlands.
The rate of increase in failures is slackening in some areas, notably
Scotland, where the number of failures fell compared with the previous three
months.

FT  11 JUN 92 / More jobs likely to be shed at BAe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE is ex-pected today to announce a further 700 redundancies
in its Dynamics missile division.
Most of the redundancies - about 450 jobs - will be at Stevenage,
Hertfordshire.
The news comes only a week after BAe announced 640 job losses at its
Stevenage space systems facility. The expected measure will bring to almost
6,000 the number of job reductions announced by leading UK defence
contractors since the start of the year.
It is likely to meet hostile reaction from unions after hopes for the
Dynamics division's future were boosted by the award in March of a Pounds
570m Ministry of Defence contract for new air-to-air missiles.
The division had already announced that it was cutting 450 jobs, bringing
its total workforce down to about 6,000. The reductions are largely among
engineering employees.
In addition to the cuts at Stevenage about 150 jobs are expected to go at
BAe's missile manufacturing plant at Lostock, near Bolton, and more than 100
at Bristol.
BAe warned this year that 10,000 jobs would be shed in the group over two
years after preliminary 1991 results showing a pre-tax loss of Pounds 81m.
Mr Tim Webb, national officer of the MSF general technical union, said the
cuts would be 'yet another blow to the reputation of British Aerospace as
Britain's leading manufacturer'.
Meanwhile, unions representing MoD civilian personnel yesterday pressed Mr
Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, for a share of defence budget savings to
be paid to staff affected by government cuts.
About 20,000 staff are due to leave under the Options for Change programme.
Over-60s will be compulsorily retired, and 14,000 headquarters staff are to
be relocated outside London.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Cadbury backed by Bank chief
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBIN Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, warned yesterday
of 'a danger of too much analysis and not enough action' in the wake of the
Cadbury committee's report on corporate governance.
He said at a conference about the report, organised by the Confederation of
British Industry, that efforts by the accountancy profession and the
proposals of the committee should together 'go some way to solve the problem
that I have recently drawn attention to - the cases where accounts had
failed to give a full or accurate picture of a company's true position'.
He said it was important for the committee's proposals to be put into
practice. 'People will begin to assume that because they have thought a
little about corporate governance and understand the central principles
clearly, that is all that needs to happen.'
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said at the conference that
the committee had been correct in proposing a voluntary code of practice for
directors, accountants and auditors. He welcomed the Cadbury committee's
recommendation that the operation of the code should be examined in two
years.
'If the sponsors felt that the code needed to be streng-thened I would
expect them to . . . put forward proposals on how the government could
help,' Mr Hamilton added.
Yesterday's conference heard that a survey of fund managers and auditors by
Burson-Marsteller, the public relations company, found that a majority of
both groups felt the recommendations did not go far enough.
The survey said most of the 22 leading fund managers and auditors
interviewed had felt members of the committee had been unwilling to produce
a report that upset corporate directors.
In particular, most shareholders doubted whether the voluntary nature of the
code would be effective - the survey found that enforcement was the issue
that most divided respondents.
The proposed means of ensuring compliance with the code is that, to qualify
for a new Stock Exchange listing, companies will have to disclose the extent
to which they comply with the code, and give reasons for any failure to do
so.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, chairman of the Stock Exchange and a member of the
Cadbury committee, speaking at the conference, said the compliance mechanism
would be effective. Shareholders would be encouraged to take managements to
task for poor board structures, forcing companies to comply with the code.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Stoy agrees to merge with Finnie: Enlarged accountancy firm
will have 176 partners and directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOY HAYWARD, the UK's 11th-largest accountancy firm by fee income, is to
merge with Finnie &amp; Co, the 20th-largest firm, and auditors to the Body
Shop.
The new firm - to be called Stoy Hayward - will have 176 partners and
directors, 1,300 professional staff and an annual fee income of more than
Pounds 82m, making it the 10th-largest firm under present rankings.
Mr Adrian Martin, managing partner at Stoy Hayward, said the merger was
agreed for strategic reasons and did not reflect any financial weaknesses in
either firm.
He said Stoy Hayward had been considering ways to strengthen its network in
the south-east since the mid 1980s as part of its expansion of its London
office. No professional staff and only a handful of support staff would lose
their jobs as a result, he said. But - in common with other practices -
neither firm had been re-placing staff who have left in recent months, said
Mr Martin.
Mr Geoff Warren, senior partner of Finnie, will become the seventh member of
Stoy's management executive, and four of Finnie's partners will join the
seven Stoy partners on its partnership council, which sets general
principles for the firm.
Mr Warren said Finnie's partners decided to begin looking for a merger
partner late last summer to strengthen the firm's presence outside the
south-east and to provide additional expertise in some practice areas.
Stoy Hayward was the only firm in which he was seriously interested, he
added, because the two firms had complementary needs and cultures.
Finnie's nine existing offices in the south-east will become Stoy Hayward
offices 'in association with Finnie &amp; Co' while its central London head
office will move into Stoy's headquarters. Its Glasgow office will merge
with Stoy's office there, while its other branches in the Isle of Man and
Sheffield will become associate offices of Stoy Hayward. Only its small
branch in Beverley, Humberside, will remain an independent firm.
No money will change hands as part of the deal, and negotiations over the
past few months have centred on how to structure profit-sharing between the
two sets of partners.
Profit-sharing will continue to reflect the different contributions of the
two firms until a new partnership remuneration agreement is drafted in two
years.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Bank of Scotland bows out of refinancing package
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR executives of Mirror Group Newspapers have been told that Bank of
Scotland has decided not to go ahead with providing Pounds 30m towards a
refinancing package.
The Bank of Scotland has been banker to the Glasgow-based Scottish Daily
Record and Sunday Mail newspapers for nearly a century. It is understood
that the Daily Record may now consider moving its account to another bank.
Bank of Scotland is one of a consortium of banks negotiating a medium-term
package to provide MGN with greater stability while decisions over its
future are taken. The package is believed to involve a facility of Pounds
250m for two years.
It is particularly important for the Record because new colour presses are
already in Glasgow, but there is insufficient money to install them.
MGN was told that the reason for Bank of Scotland's decision was 'financial
prudence'. Bank of Scotland said last night: 'The bank has not withdrawn
from the consortium, nor has it reduced the limits (of the Scottish Daily
Record).'
National Westminster, the senior consortium bank, has been reallocating the
Pounds 30m among other member banks and it is believed that most of it has
been placed. The refinancing of MGN is not thought to have been jeopardised.
The company is expected to go ahead with the publication of its accounts
later this month. That will be followed soon after by a relisting of its
shares.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Court to settle Maxwell claim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Westminster Bank yesterday asked the High Court to settle the
dispute over the ownership of shares in Teva, an Israeli pharmaceutical
company, which are held by the bank as security and are claimed both by the
Maxwell pension funds and by the administrator of Robert Maxwell Group, one
of the Maxwell private companies.
NatWest said if the court decided that beneficial ownership of the shares
never passed from the funds managed by Bishopsgate Investment Management to
RMG, then it was prepared to relinquish the security and return the shares
to the pension funds.
If, however, the court ruled that title in the shares passed from BIM and
the common investment fund to RMG before being mortgaged to the bank in
return for a loan, then it would not return them, because it was a 'bona
fide purchaser for value without notice'.
The 25m Teva shares, with a value of just less than Pounds 20m, were
mortgaged to NatWest as security for a new loan of Dollars 27.3m on November
7 last year after a Maxwell request for new money to meet interest payments
due on the MCC 'jumbo facility' used to fund the purchase of Macmillan.
The bank said the mortgage was taken in good faith after receiving written
assurances that they were beneficially owned by RMG. NatWest asked questions
before accepting the mortgage because the certificates were in the name of
BIM. It then took a mortgage in the same form from BIM as a guarantee for
the RMG mortgage.
NatWest said yesterday it was only on December 5, when the Maxwell private
companies went into administration, that it was notified by the pension fund
managers that the shares might be trust assets.
It asked the court to determine the issue because the RMG administrators
indicated the shares should not be surrendered to the detriment of other RMG
creditors.

Earlier yesterday, Mr Major, who was en route to Rio de Janeiro for the
Earth Summit, visited the Cusiana oilfields with President Cesar Gaviria of
Colombia to see British Petroleum's biggest find in 25 years. The premier
said he had no doubt that the development of the Cusiana reserves would have
a dramatic and beneficial effect on Colombia's economy.
Mr Major said Britain planned to 'enhance' its anti-drug effort with

FT  11 JUN 92 / Cuba opens doors wide to foreign investment: Damian Fraser
takes a business trip to Havana
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Cuban government yesterday stepped up its latest and most visible
attempt to attract foreign capital, to shore up the island's battered
economy.
About 125 potential foreign investors arrived in Havana to be awarded
celebrity status by the government, and a rare meeting with President Fidel
Castro. They included officials from subsidiaries of Eastman Kodak, ICI,
Philip Morris, American Express and Procter &amp; Gamble, and a large number of
US lawyers, some of whom were said to be representing camera-shy
Cuban-Americans.
Eighty of the participants were from the US, although US law forbids them to
invest in Cuba. One delegate suggested the Cubans were unwittingly making
arrangements for life after President Castro. 'We can't invest now, but we
need to be ready in case Fidel goes,' one US visitor added.
The visitors were to meet the foreign trade minister, the national bank
president and senior officials from their respective sectors.
The investors had been briefed on Tuesday by other government officials at
the Mexican resort of Cancun, as part of the conference on investment in
Cuba organised by Euromoney magazine.
The clear message was that almost all foreign investment was welcome, and
that rules to limit foreign ownership to 49 per cent of an enterprise could
be partially lifted. 'It is,' said Mr Oscar Alfonso Montalvan, of the state
committee for economic co-operation, 'a socialist opening for a capitalist
world.'
Cuba claims to have received about Dollars 400m-Dollars 500m (Pounds
217m-Pounds 271m) in foreign investment last year, mainly in big hotels
built by, among others, the Spanish company Grupo Sol.
Mr Ernesto Melendez Bach, of the economic co-operation committee, said that
due to this, Cuba would attract 1m tourists in 1995, up from 500,000 this
year and 250,000 in 1988. He said that the typical foreign tourism developer
in Cuba recovered his investment in 3 1/2 years.
Mr Melendez and other officials said Cuba was open to investment in oil
exploration, nickel, capital goods, textiles and agriculture, and could
refine oil for foreigners.
The government says it has given individual state enterprises authority to
make most of the decisions in their sector, in an attempt to ease
bureaucracy in foreign investment.
Mr Orlando Hernandez Gui-llen, commercial director at the foreign trade
ministry, claimed that, for example, approval to set up a textile factory in
Cuba would take a mere 25-30 days.
Mr Raul Amado Blanco, Bank of Cuba vice-president, said Cuba would consider
debt-equity swaps to attract foreign capital, although he emphasised that
fresh money would have to be part of any such arrangement. Cuba is in
default on some Dollars 6.5bn of its foreign debt. Mr Blanco said there were
'possibilities for fruitful dialogue' with banks on the debt, but there
remained an impasse between Cuba and its official creditors.
Foreign investment is now seen as the last hope for Cuba, whose gross
domestic product dropped by 25-30 per cent last year after the collapse of
trade with the former Soviet Union.
The potential foreign investors seemed unsure what to make of Cuba's
overtures. One fund manager enthused: 'Cuba is following the China model. We
could easily have closed-end investment trusts with joint ventures with
Cuban partners that would trade in non-American stockmarkets.'
A time-share tourism developer from Miami was not so sure: 'Right now, all
we have heard is that they want our money. But what about legal certainty?
Can they buy you out when they want?'

FT  11 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Saudi Arabian minister warns on carbon tax
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Hisham Nazer, the Saudi Arabian oil minister, warned yesterday against
the introduction of a carbon tax, arguing that 'it could lead to a state of
disturbance in the world oil market'.
Addressing a plenary session at the summit, he said oil was already heavily
taxed and a further charge would affect investment and energy production.
His speech came after Dr Subroto, head of Opec, had criticised the focusing
of international attention on fossil fuels and CO emissions. He complained
that the EC's proposed carbon tax would lead to a transfer of resources from
developing to developed countries.
Mr Nazer also called for increasing research on global warming 'to remove
scientific doubts which still surround the question of climate change',
adding it was 'unacceptable to propagate the use of certain means of energy,
such as nuclear energy, under cover of dealing with an environmental
question' which is still in doubt.

sponsorship - Diary
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE centrepiece of the Riocentro is a 20-foot red and white sculpture
entitled Paradise Regained, made entirely of recycled aluminium. But the
monument has proved something of a headache. British sculptress Edwina
Sandys made it at the invitation of the UN Development Programme, and the
hope was that some kindly sponsor would foot the bill.
That has not happened, and Ms Sandys is now about Dollars 75,000 (Pounds
41,200) out of pocket. She is still hoping to find a commercial backer so
that the piece can stay in Rio as a memento.
*****
Summit participants are taking great national pride in the decor of their
negotiating cubicles. The FT prize for the most imaginatively decorated
office goes to Senegal, with its elegantly arranged swathes of colourful
batik. The Japanese box is, of course, the biggest and best-equipped. The
Malaysians do a good line in exotic flowers and have the best coffee. The
delegation from Botswana has an impressive array of tropical plants and the
slickest public relations machine.
A special award goes to the British as the most organised party; there is
always someone available for a briefing, even if the receptionist is rather
ferocious.
The Saudis have strung carpets on the walls along with pictures of King
Fahd. A picture of Saddam Hussein dominates the Iraqi box. The Chinese have
covered their cubicle with uninspiring information posters. The Brazilians
are commended for their friendliness and constant supply of coffee.
The booby prize goes to the US, which rents a tiny undecorated box which
would fit 20 times into the Japanese cubicle. American delegates prefer to
spend time and hold briefings in the Sheraton hotel, 15 miles away.
*****
They call her the Dragon Lady: Ting Wen Liam. She is officially Malaysia's
ambassador to the UN Food and Agricultural Organisation in Rome, but she has
been leading her country's side in summit negotiations on the forest
agreement - with considerable effect. She had the job of fending off
attempts to establish an international treaty on forests. As one of the
world's largest exporters of tropical hardwoods, Malaysia does not want its
logging subjected to outside controls.
There are signs that the diminutive and tough-talking Ms Ting is succeeding,
for the summit might well drop plans for a treaty in favour of a loose
declaration of forest principles, which many people would reject as
meaningless.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Danger of UPI closure tomorrow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By OUR FOREIGN STAFF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED Press International, the loss-ridden news agency, last night was in
danger of closure tomorrow, the Rev Pat Robertson, a US television
evangelist who once had presidential ambitions, having decided not to
proceed with his Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.2m) takeover.
He had told a Washington news conference yesterday that a review of UPI's
finances and operations showed 'its economics just don't seem to make
sense'. He said he might bid for one or two of the company's assets,
including possibly its name, later in the day.
Last night, the agency stated that it would cease operations at the end of
tomorrow if additional funds were not found. Lawyers for UPI said the agency
was negotiating with other potential buyers, but the company president
conceded that it faced an uphill battle.
Mr Robertson, who runs the Christian Broadcasting Network, emerged as the
only bidder for all of UPI at a bankruptcy hearing last month. He was given
30 days to inspect its books, during which time he has been paying the 500
staff still working at the agency.
Advisers had told him he would have to spend about Dollars 31m on UPI over
the next 18 months to make it notionally viable, but with no guarantee of
commercial success. He noted wryly that his broadcasting company had
recently dropped UPI's service in favour of Associated Press.

FT  11 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Bush to confront realities of Rio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS HE packed his bags before flying to Rio de Janeiro today US President
George Bush might have been forgiven a moment of doubt over whether he made
the right choice in finally deciding to attend the Earth Summit.
By threatening to stay away, Mr Bush was able to force concessions from
other nations on the climate change convention, which is due to be signed at
the meeting.
In the last few days, however, the US has appeared more isolated than ever,
facing mounting criticism not only from the developing world but from its
industrialised allies for emasculating the climate convention and for
refusing to sign a biodiversity convention to which even the UK,
Washington's staunchest friend on these issues, had swallowed its
objections.
Even a short stopover in Panama has gone awry, after a US soldier was shot
and killed during a student demonstration on the eve of Mr Bush's visit. The
killing appears likely to upstage any attempt to remind US voters that it
was Mr Bush who freed Panama from General Manuel Noriega, its former
military dictator.
US officials tried to take the offensive this week to pave the way for Mr
Bush's arrival in Rio. They claimed the US record on the environment was far
better than those of many of its critics, and attacked Japan and Germany for
bowing to a 'guilty developed world logic'.
One senior US negotiator assailed both developing and developed countries
for cynically putting rhetoric ahead of action, and claimed one European
diplomat had told him his country would sign the Rio conventions because it
did not take them seriously.
'These countries need a shot across the bow. They are taking a
holier-than-thou attitude when they have records nowhere near as good as
ours,' he said.
There is an element of truth to this claim. The US spends nearly Dollars
130bn (Pounds 71.4bn) a year on pollution control, or about 2 per cent of
gross domestic product - substantially more than most other developed
countries.
The US has also achieved considerable reductions in pollutant emissions.
Lead emissions, for example, have been curbed from 163,600 tons in 1970 to
just 2,200 tons in 1990, while carbon monoxide emissions have been nearly
halved over the same period.
But the US, with its high living standards and profligate energy
consumption, still contributes more to global pollution, both per capita and
in absolute terms, than other countries.
Details of environmental policy have been largely eclipsed domestically by a
black and white perception of the conflict between the environment and
employment - a perception heightened both by the persistent sluggishness of
the US economy and the imminent US election.
Mr William Reilly, administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency and
the US's chief delegate to the Rio conference, has often been a lonely
advocate within the Bush administration of environmental protection.
In recent months, however, his position has come under sustained attack,
especially from the Council on Competitiveness, a pro-business committee
chaired by Vice-President Dan Quayle that works behind the scenes to
influence administration policies and regulations.
This battle came to a head last week with the leaking of a memorandum in
which Mr Reilly sought backing for a final attempt to change the
biodiversity treaty in such a way that the US could sign it.

FT  11 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Convention on forests causes high emotions
 -Deep divisions over how to conserve the world's dwindling tree cover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE most emotional conflict at the Earth Summit has been over the world's
dwindling forests. Before the conference, plans for a forest convention had
to be dropped and last-minute negotiations were still under way yesterday on
a set of 'forest principles' for conservation and management.
Even if agreement is reached, environmentalists complain that this would not
be binding and would not halt de-forestation.
Also, there seems unlikely to be any commitment to a future convention.
The crux of the debate is tropical forests and a sharp difference in how
they are viewed by north and south.
Industrialised nations tend to see them in environmental terms as a trove of
biodiversity and greenhouse gas 'sinks' that absorb carbon dioxide and thus
reduce global warming.
Developing countries tend to see them in economic terms as a trove of
resources, such as a free source of fuel, valuable tropical woods and
potential farmland.
Malaysia, which has led resistance by the Group of 77 developing countries
to a convention, argues that, if the forests are so important, then the
north must pay to preserve them, pointing out that the first world has
already destroyed most of its forests.
With plans to log up to 50 per cent of its forests by the end of the decade,
Malaysia is hardly disinterested.
Mr Lim Keng Yaik, its primary industries minister, says: 'This is the first
time in any multilateral negotiations I've seen the poor south being asked
to support the rich north. Well, I'm poor and need my forests to get on in
life so, if you want them, you must pay - and give me technology and
investment'.
In the Rio negotiations themselves, India is taking the hardest line, while
officials from Brazil, which has the world's largest forest, insist they
will only agree to a convention if it includes other areas such as temperate
forests, deserts, marine estuaries, mountains and savannahs.
All OECD countries and Russia favour a strong declaration on forests, with a
commitment to a future convention, but the US delegation is leading the
charge. It is anxious to show its green credentials in at least one area and
so have at least one document for President George Bush to sign when he
arrives today.
Mr William Reilly, head of the Environmental Protection Agency, says: 'The
principal priority of the US at this conference is in better management and
conservation of the world's forests.'
Last week, Mr Bush announced a Dollars 150m annual grant for forests, and
the US moved to curb clear-cutting in its own forests, but the initiative
was interpreted as a distraction from its refusal to sign the biodiversity
treaty.
Environmentalists even say that US support on forests is proving a liability
because of its status as the villain of the summit.
Environmentalists want the issue resolved urgently because forest cover has
been reduced by a third from its original extent.
Over the last four decades, de-forestation has accelerated sharply,
especially in developing countries, which have 60 per cent of remaining
world forest cover.
Tropical forests are disappearing at the rate of 17m hectares a year,
according to FAO statistics. This not only adds to global warming, soil
erosion and flooding, but, because 50-75 per cent of all species of plants
and animals live in tropical rainforests and most are yet to be identified,
this means species are being lost even before being identified by humanity.
Developing countries are furious at the attempt to describe forests as a
'common global heritage.' Mr Jeff Sirmon of the US Forestry Service insists:
'Forests must be saved for the good of the planet.'
But Mr Lim protests: 'That's just a way of saying - what's mine is mine and
what's yours is mine too. If it's common heritage, then pay for it, just as
I have to pay for oil and biotechnology.'
Third world nations also argue that they have more pressing priorities, such
as present poverty, and see any attempt at international monitoring as an
infringement of sovereignty.
There is backing for this from northern forest groups, which issued a
statement to the summit, saying that Canada and Brazil are comparable in
size yet Brazil has protected more than 9 per cent of its forest, compared
to less than 3 per cent in Canada, and points out that the average US
citizen uses 300 kg paper a year while, on the African continent, the
average is less than one.
So contentious is the issue that, until this week, it seemed that even the
forest principles would not be agreed to.
With 10 per cent of the world's forest and a 25 per cent share in the
Dollars 100bn world timber trade, Canada has been playing a vital mediating
role.
Mr Jag Maini from the Canadian environment ministry, explains: 'For us,
forests have both an economic and environmental role because Canadian
forestry represents a Dollars 55bn industry and 800,000 jobs.'
Disagreement remains on the issue of trade and the ability of countries to
take unilateral action, such as boycotts of timber products, as well as
commitment to a future convention.
But environmental groups say that, even if signed, the principles are too
weak because they are not binding, set no date to halt de-forestation, and
fail to address root causes of de-forestation such as poverty and terms of
trade.
Mr Robert Buschbacher of the World Wide Fund for Nature says: 'The
declaration is weaker than some existing international agreements. It is a
huge missed opportunity to protect the world's forests.'
Mr Maini is less pessimistic: 'It's a very complicated issue and the forest
principles are at least a start. I see them like the Ten Commandments - we
all lie and cheat a little but they've played an essential role in
establishing social order.'

MR Victor Polay Campos, leader of Peru's second-largest guerrilla group, has
been captured in a Lima suburb. His arrest is a much-needed boost for the
anti-terrorist police and a relief for the government, which this week
introduced a night-time traffic curfew in the capital following stepped-up
terrorist activity.
Mr Polay is head of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA), a
pro-Cuban group which has operated in Peru since the mid-1980s. It has
periodically vied with the hard-line Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path)
for domination of areas of Peru's coca-rich northern jungle. The group was
particularly active in Lima during the Gulf war, attacking US-affiliated
installations and businesses.
Mr Polay was first captured in 1989 but escaped in July 1990.

AN international court of arbitration yesterday ended a 25-year-old dispute
between France and Canada over territorial waters claimed by the tiny French
Atlantic Ocean islands of Saint-Pierre and Miquelon, Reuter reports from New
York.
The court, in a 3-to-2 vote, ruled that the islands, off the coast of
Newfoundland and Nova Scotia, have fishing rights up to 24 miles (40km) off
their shores. They were also given a narrow 10.5-mile corridor that
stretches 200 miles into the Atlantic. France had claimed fishing rights
extending 200 miles from both islands. Canada had offered just a 12-mile
limit.
A drilling moratorium in the disputed zone, agreed by both countries in
1967, will be lifted shortly, allowing Canada to award contracts to oil
companies.
The two islands were ceded to France in 1773 by Canada as a haven for French
fishermen.

<TEXT>
KHMER Rouge guerrillas have told the United Nations they will refuse to
co-operate fully with a UN plan to bring democracy to Cambodia, throwing the
peace process into doubt three days before the country's various armies are
due to start regrouping their forces and handing over their weapons.
'This constitutes a clear breach of the (October 1991) Paris agreement, and
is therefore extremely unacceptable,' Mr Yasushi Akashi, head of the UN
Transitional Authority, (Untac) said yesterday.
The Khmer Rouge murdered 1m Cambodians during its rule over the country
between 1975 and the Vietnamese invasion of 1978.
Khmer Rouge leaders claim that they cannot co-operate fully with the UN
until they are sure that there are no Vietnamese troops left in Cambodia.
UN officials and various governments have appealed to China and Thailand,
the main backers of the Khmer Rouge, to persuade them to co-operate with the
UN plan, which is supposed to lead to elections in less than a year.
Mr Akashi said the cantonment of forces would proceed as scheduled from June
13, although it would begin only in selected areas to avoid endangering the
security of the other three factions. At least one of the factions said it
could not regroup its forces unless the Khmer Rouge did likewise.
Mr Gareth Evans, the Australian foreign minister, described The Khmer Rouge
letter yesterday as 'brinksmanship' and 'more in the nature of huff and puff
than a very real threat to the process'.
Reuter adds from Moscow: Russia yesterday condemned the Khmer Rouge for
obstructing UN peace efforts. 'The Khmer Rouge continue to pursue the policy
of violating the ceasefire, enlarging the territory under their control,
turning down constructive co-operation with the UN. . . ,' a Foreign
Ministry spokesman said.

<TEXT>
PAPUA New Guinea (PNG) yesterday warned foreign governments and
environmental organisations to stay out of a controversy over the impact of
mining on its river systems and coastal waters.
The warning followed revelations that Mr Paul Keating, the Australian Prime
Minister, delivered a letter during an official visit in April which
criticised environmental standards at the Ok Tedi copper and gold mine.
The mine has been strongly criticised by local politicians in PNG's remote
western province, close to the border with Indonesian Irian Jaya. The
provincial government has threatened to close the mine, but has not yet
carried out its threat.
Ok Tedi Mining (OTML), the company which operates the mine, claims any
environmental damage which has occurred is outweighed by the economic
benefit to PNG of substantial gold and copper production.
OTML is owned by BHP, (30 per cent), the PNG government (20 per cent) and a
group of smaller shareholders. The mine is operated under an environmental
agreement between OTML and the central government.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANAND Panyarachun, a respected businessman and former diplomat, was
re-appointed as prime minister of Thailand last night by a surprise edict
from the royal palace which paves the way for new elections.
The appointment is likely to provide at least a temporary solution to the
country's two-month political crisis, which culminated in the shooting of 49
pro-democracy demonstrators by troops last month and the resignation of Gen
Suchinda Kraprayoon, the previous premier.
'I understand that my main duty will be to organise the elections,' Mr Anand
said last night. He said that he would probably dissolve the existing
parliament in two or three weeks, and that his government would last a total
of about four months.
He said he would attempt to repair the damage done to the economy by the
violence, although it would take time to restore the vulnerable tourism
industry. 'The economic fundamentals are still strong, so it will not take
us very long to improve the local economy,' Mr Anand said.
The proposed delay in the dissolution of parliament will allow time for
military leaders to testify next week before a committee of MPs
investigating the violence.
Yesterday parliament gave final approval to constitutional amendments
demanded by the opposition and the demonstrators, including a provision that
the premiership be restricted to elected members of parliament. Mr Anand has
not been elected and the amendments will become law as soon as they are
printed in the royal gazette.
Opposition politicians want to reduce permanently the influence of the
military in politics, but they fear that new elections will not necessarily
overturn the pro-military majority in parliament. Vote-buying is common in
rural areas.
Mr Anand said Mr Arthit Urairat, the speaker of parliament, telephoned him
at 5.30pm Bangkok time yesterday and asked him to be prime minister to break
a political deadlock: the governing coalition of pro-military parties were
backing a candidate unacceptable to the Thai people, while the opposition
was supporting an acceptable candidate but did not have enough seats.
In a statement released later, Mr Arthit said Thailand was facing a crisis
and the appointment of a poorly chosen prime minister 'is a decision which
could lead to violence and catastrophe'. He said his solution would return
sovereignty to the people. 'I have carefully considered the situation,' he
said. 'For all parties to compromise and for democracy to prosper I propose
Anand Panyarachun.' It was unclear whether the surprise appointment had been
initiated by the speaker or the king.
Shortly before the announcement Air Chief Marshal Somboon Rahong, the
controversial pro-military candidate whose appointment could have led to
renewed demonstrations, told reporters that he would be the new prime
minister.
A celebration party was even being prepared at his house. Air Chief Marshal
Somboon, however, said after hearing of Mr Anand's appointment that he was
relieved that a burden had been lifted from his shoulders. 'I am really
happy,' he said.
Mr Anand won praise from foreign investors and local businessmen for
economic reforms and a drive against corruption in his year-long tenure as
prime minister between the military coup d'etat of February 1991 and the
elections in March this year.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Libya's press assails Gadaffi over Arab ties: A new twist in
Libyan policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LIBYA'S official press has launched unprecedented criticism of Colonel
Muammer Gadaffi's relations with fellow-Arabs, and in an extraordinary twist
has called for better relations with the US.
For the first time since he came to power in a 1969 bloodless coup, the
idiosyncratic Col Gadaffi has been upbraided in the official Al Jamhariya or
'State of the Masses' newspaper - mouthpiece of the regime.
'We say to you, you are free, go alone to your Arabism and your Islamic
links. As for us, we have America. It is much better for us to co-operate
with America than with all the Arabs because we have realised that our own
interests are above all else,' the Libyan news agency, JANA, quoted the
paper as saying.
Libya-watchers believe that the criticism may have been orchestrated to
provide Col Gadaffi with room for manoeuvre on the eve of a meeting this
weekend of Libya's General People's Congress, or parliament.
Col Gadaffi has said repeatedly that it would be up to the parliament to
decide whether to yield to either the US or Britain two Libyans accused of
the 1988 bombing of an American airliner over Lockerbie in Scotland in which
271 people perished.
Calls for the Libyan leader to distance himself from his brother-Arabs may
also reflect intense disappointment at the decision of Arab regimes to fall
into line with United Nations sanctions.
In April, following Libya's refusal to hand over the two men accused of the
Lockerbie bombing, the UN Security Council implemented a sanctions package
which included a suspension of air links and a thinning of Libyan diplomatic
personnel abroad. The Arabs complied with the air embargo.
Col Gadaffi, who expressed great admiration for the late Egyptian leader
Gamal Abdel Nasser, has put Arab unity at the centre of his ideology, and
has frequently proposed union with surrounding countries.
It is unclear whether the Al Jamhariya commentary might herald a change in
policy, but its criticism of the Arabs was unambiguous. It charged them with
having shunned Libya and laughing at it while taking part in a 'murder by
instalments' through UN sanctions.
'We ask you what benefit did we get from our Arabism, with the Arabs asking
you to hand over our sons to the enemy and to obey Western demands and
decisions,' the paper said.
'. . . We ask you: why do Arab workers benefit from Libyan oil. . . the
Libyan oil should go to American workers if they benefit us or if we benefit
from them. . . this is better than Arabism and Islam.'
Libya is also being pressed to co-operate in investigations into the 1989
downing of a French UTA flight on its way from Brazzaville to Paris, in
which all 171 passengers and crew were killed. France wants to question four
Libyans in connection with the UTA bombing, including Col Gadaffi's
brother-in-law.
JANA also reported on Tuesday that it had been taken over by 'revolutionary
forces', and that the agency's director had been dismissed. A commentary
accused the previous management of purveying disinformation and attempting
to 'ridicule the people in the guise of slogans on Arabism and Islam.'
'Henceforth JANA will be managed by the conscious revolutionary forces which
know their interests and those of the Libyans,' the JANA statement said.

ALGERIA has freed 2,000 suspected Moslem activists from detention centres in
the Sahara desert to mark the feast of Eid al-Adha, officials said
yesterday, Reuter reports from Algiers.
About 1,200 people have been freed from the centres since March 21, out of
the 7,448 detained under a state of emergency declared on February 9,
official figures show. The official news agency APS said there would be
further releases. Human rights groups have demanded the closure of the
desert detention centres.
Suspected Moslem activists were rounded up after riots blamed on the Islamic
Salvation Front (FIS), which was poised to take power in a general election
cancelled in January and has since been banned by court order.
Meanwhile, Mr Mohammed Boudiaf, head of state, appealed to Algerians to join
his Patriotic Rally - a new movement which excludes Moslem radical groups
and which the authorities hope will undermine their support. Mr Boudiaf
dismissed calls from two leading political parties, the Socialist Forces
Front and National Liberation Front, to replace the government with one of
national unity.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Israel's politicians seek out the immigrant vote / A look at
how candidates in the coming election are targeting newcomers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAELI politicians campaigning for the general election on June 23 have
taken to stopping in a gigantic caravan park which sprang up a year ago just
outside the southern city of Beersheva, on the edge of the Negev desert.
More than 1,000 mobile homes stand in the sand at Nahal Beqa, forming a huge
staging post for some of the 400,000 immigrants who have arrived in Israel
over the past three years.
Since it opened last August, Nahal Beqa has become home to some 5,000
newcomers from the Soviet Union and about one thousand 'black Jews' from
Ethiopia - interspersed by a few hundred Israeli university students
strategically placed to forestall any clashes between people from such
diverse cultures.
What new citizens of Nehal Beqa - many of whom have a vote - want to hear
from politicians is what they will do to create employment that will get
them out of their immigrant ghetto into permanent housing and launched on
the new lives they are seeking in Israel. 'Jobs - that is the most important
thing to them,' says Mr Adi Habad, site manager.
The impact of immigration has sharpened the issue of the economy in a
country where election campaigns tend to be dominated by the big political
issues of the Arab-Israeli conflict.
With unemployment at record levels and little sign of improvement, the
opposition Labour Party has put economic policy high on its list of attacks
on the record of the ruling Likud party.
This is not just to attract votes among the immigrants themselves, among
whom unemployment is running at 40 per cent. Many of Likud's core voters in
lower-income 'Sephardi,' or oriental Jewish, communities have also been
feeling the pinch.
Beersheva is a prime example. Some 20,000 immigrants have boosted the
population from 113,000 to 135,000 in less than three years. Some 25 per
cent of the veteran population are of Moroccan extraction, many living in
poor neighbourhoods. Increased public services and construction activity
have added to employment, but Beersheva has been hampered by industrial
stagnation and cuts in big local companies such as Makhteshim Chemicals, an
offshoot of the trade union-owned Koor Industries.
In the 1988 election, Likud took 43 per cent of the vote in Beersheva to
Labour's 28 per cent. Local Labour campaigners, who are stressing economic
themes, are aiming for 35 per cent this time, a figure they say would imply
a Labour victory nationwide.
How bad is the state of the economy? Some indicators look pretty healthy.
Growth last year was about 6 per cent. Employment grew. So did investment
and business profitability and productivity. But these mask an underlying
picture in which fast population growth has meant negligible per capita
growth. According to the Bank of Israel, half of 1991 growth was due to a
construction boom which is now over.
'In other industries there are as yet no signs that sustainable growth is
about to set in,' the bank said. Exports shrank last year, an ominous
development for a sector supposed to be the engine of long-term growth.
Workforce growth outpaced job creation, leaving unemployment now at a record
11.6 per cent. Inflation hovers above 15 per cent. In early 1992, the bank
detected a decline in investment and economic activity.
Above all, it said, the government did 'too little and too hesitantly' to
invest heavily in infrastructure cut heavy taxes and government spending and
institute reforms such as privatisation of the big state-owned industrial
sector and the banks - which in turn are big industrial owners in Israel.
Labour - having shed its ideological commitment to socialism - now calls for
all these prescriptions to be implemented. It says there must be a
're-ordering of priorities' - stressing that the hundreds of millions of
dollars spent by the Likud on Jewish settlements in the occupied territories
could be redirected to investment in places such as Beersheva.
But the Likud, still proclaiming itself the party of liberal economics
despite its poor record, has a point when it calls into question Labour's
new-found market message. Mr Shalom Peri, Labour's campaign manager in
Beersheva, makes no bones about what he is promising to voters who have lost
their jobs in recent years. 'People know the government must come with
public investment. The Negev area will never develop through the free
economy.'
Many Russian immigrants are justifiably cynical about both parties,
regarding them as captives of the system and their own vested interests.
They see Likud as being obsessed with the occupied territories and Labour
still tied to the powerful Histadrut trade union federation which has
resisted economic reform.
'It is absolutely chaotic. There is no serious progress to absorb the
immigrants,' says Mr Vladimir Gontar, formerly a laser technology expert in
the Soviet Union now working at Beersheva's Ben Gurion University of the
Negev.
'Not the Likud, nor Labour has a serious programme for a new society based
on the new brains which have come here, and that is perhaps the feeling of
all the Russians,' says Mr Gontar.
Meanwhile, in a severe embarrassment to the government, the message has got
back to Jews still living in the former Soviet territories, many of whom
have judged that economic prospects in Israel are no better than at home.
Russian immigration has slumped from 20,000 a month at the peak to less than
4,000 in May.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK launches a final sortie: Britain is anxious to dissuade
Germany from quitting the European Fighter Aircraft project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S defence ministry is mounting a last-ditch effort to keep Germany
in the four-nation European Fighter Aircraft project by arguing that it can
be produced more cheaply than Bonn estimates.
At the same time, it is preparing the ground for a German withdrawal from
the Pounds 20bn project, which could be followed by a similar move by Spain.
This would leave Britain and Italy to carry out the remainder of the
programme, now near the end of an Pounds 8bn development phase. Initial
contacts have been made with other European countries that might join in the
production phase to ensure EFA's viability.
Spain, which delayed before joining the development programme four years
ago, is understood to have assured Britain it will stay in the project as
long as Germany does, and will not quit unless the price of the aircraft
increases. If Germany does withdraw, however, some increase in costs to the
other partners appears inevitable.
The odds on Bonn pulling out from the sophisticated fighter, widely seen in
Germany as exceeding the country's needs in a transformed east-west climate,
have increased sharply since the industrial partners tabled production
proposals in April. Initial British calculations were that German withdrawal
might increase the EFA's price to the UK by 7 per cent. If Spain backed out,
too, the increase would be 12 per cent. However, officials now indicate that
the extra cost might be smaller.
Negotiations are under way with the two German-based industry consortia  -
the airframe grouping Eurofighter (British Aerospace, MBB of Germany, Alenia
of Italy and Casa of Spain) and the engine team Eurojet (Rolls-Royce, MTU of
Germany, Fiat and the Spanish company ITP) - to bring down production costs.
A decision to set up production - at a cost of some Pounds 3.5bn between the
four countries - was initially due to be made this year, but UK officials
say it is not now required before mid-1993. The decision requires a
commitment by the partners on how many aircraft they intend to buy, but
actual production orders would not be placed until 1995, enabling producers
to meet the 1998 target for starting deliveries. The UK says Germany could
push back its delivery schedule to ease costs in the initial years.
Bonn has a more pressing timetable, however, because it needs Bundestag
approval to allocate money next year for tooling-up. Industry has already
offered to cut its price by 5 per cent and UK officials expect further
reductions.
The original proposal gave the Germans what they call a 'system price' of
DM133.9m (Pounds 46m) per aircraft - an accounting concept used by the
German military which, say British officials, nobody else recognises. It
includes what in the UK is known a 'unit production price' - the price of
each aircraft as it comes off the assembly line, plus a share of the
production investment cost - with 35 per cent added on to cover logistics
support, and value-added tax.
Britain says the logistical support allowance is too high for an aircraft
designed to be cheaper to operate and maintain than current-generation
aircraft. It is understood to be aiming for a unit production cost of about
Pounds 28m-Pounds 29m. With initial support costs this would come to about
Pounds 36m.
The UK believes costs can be cut by reorganising the production plan. The
partner countries could be assured of high-technology work without
automatically sharing in each major element such as flight controls. Final
assembly lines, instead of one in each country, would be reduced to two at
most: one at BAe in Lancashire, another either in Bavaria or Italy.
If Germany pulls out, more work would go to the UK. British officials reckon
this would save costs because British wages are lower than Germany's. But
the saving would be unlikely to compensate for the extra burden of
production investment, shared between fewer partners. Any add-on cost would
be likely to force down the numbers of aircraft the remaining partners buy.
The RAF wants 250 aircraft as originally planned, but the UK Treasury can be
expected to block any extra spending. The other partners have already
reduced their declared plans - Germany to 200, Italy to 130 and Spain to 87,
making a total of 667. This is 13 per cent down on the original programme.
None of the plans is secure. The project needs a production run of at least
350-400 aircraft. Below that, say officials, it will cease to be competitive
with the alternatives.
The UK argues strongly that there is 'no cheaper aircraft with acceptable
performance'. Among the main options, the McDonnell Douglas F-15, the
top-of-the-range US fighter, would be costlier; its planned successor, the
Lockheed-Boeing-General Dynamics F-22, even more so; McDonnell Douglas's
F/A-18 is judged less capable than EFA and, the way Britain does its sums on
aircraft costs, no cheaper.
The industrial stakes are high. Government and industry officials estimate
EFA production, under present plans, would sustain 60,000 jobs in Europe,
including 20,000 in the UK, and an equivalent number among indirect
suppliers.

A UNITED Nations convoy was attacked in Sarajevo yesterday while on its way

Sarajevo radio said one man was injured in the attack on the peace-keeping

outskirts of the city after a day-long drive from Belgrade through
Bosnia-Hercegovina's war zone.
The officers, led by senior peace-keeper General Lewis Mackenzie, hope to
arrange the removal of all anti-aircraft weapons held by Serb irregulars
surrounding the airport and oversee their withdrawal from the immediate
vicinity to allow the transport of supplies for thousands of hungry
residents.
UN officials stressed that the operation 'was highly dangerous' since it
depended on all sides honouring a ceasefire.
'Ceasefires come and go, but we have to keep trying,' said Mr Cedric
Thornberry, the UN's chief negotiator.
The officials also warned that they did not have the means to provide air
cover for the UN troops.
The 1,000 troops, which will be drawn from Canada's Royal 22nd regiment,
will be equipped with 80 armoured personnel carriers to safeguard the flow
of humanitarian relief supplies through the airport into Sarajevo.
In Washington yesterday, a senior US senator warned that military action
might be needed to curb Serbia's territorial ambitions. 'The time for
drawing the line has come,' said Senator Richard Lugar, a Republican from
Indiana.
'The UN should authorise nation states to use force. Nato should draw up
plans for a comprehensive use of force as thorough as that formulated for
air, sea and ground forces in Desert Storm,' he added.
Senator Lugar's intervention is an attempt to end US political indifference
to events in Bosnia-Hercegovina.

FT  11 JUN 92 / European airlines cut fares from US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN airlines yesterday cut their ticket prices between Europe and the
US in response to a transatlantic price war which broke out among US air
carriers earlier this week.
Lufthansa, the German state airline, Swissair and British Airways cut prices
on flights from the US to match those made earlier this week by Delta,
American Airlines, United Airlines and others.
KLM, the Dutch airline, said it was were reviewing its pricing policy.
This is latest round in the fight for market share on the world's most
competitive long-haul route. It was initiated on Monday by the third biggest
US carrier, Delta Airlines, whose larger rivals, United Airlines and
American Airlines, quickly followed suit. Continental Airlines has also
matched most of the lower fares.
The reductions are on higher-priced tickets, including first and business
class. Lufthansa's New York-Frankfurt business class return ticket is
Dollars 772 cheaper at Dollars 2,000 (Pounds 1,098.9).
These are for the summer season only, so travel must start by September 30
and finish by October 14. Transatlantic traffic has been healthy in recent
weeks, especially by comparison with slack domestic US demand. But the
growth in traffic between the US and Europe has been largely leisure
travellers buying cut-price tickets. The Delta move was intended to
stimulate business traffic.
US carriers have been price-cutting heavily on domestic US routes since
April, when American Airlines cut business fares and created a simplified
ticket structure on its domestic routes. The price war has come at a time
when air travel is beginning to pick up after a slump induced by the
recession and the Gulf war. Six of the world's top 10 airlines have lost
money over the past two years and with price cuts now have little hope of
returning to profit this year.
The price war triggered by Delta caught its competitors by surprise.
'We're puzzled and totally perplexed by Delta's move because advance
bookings to Europe have been very strong,' said United on Tuesday. Delta cut
fares by up to 45 per cent on business, first-class and full-price economy
ticket.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Britain and EC close to deal for 48 hour working week: UK
would get 10 years to implement directive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK and its EC partners are close to agreeing plans to limit the working
week to 48 hours, breaking a two-year deadlock on one of the most
controversial pieces of community legislation.
The British government has fiercely resisted conceding a ceiling on working
hours. According to senior European Commission officials all 12 would accept
a 48-hour working week under the compromise, but Britain would be given an
additional 7-year implementation grace period.
European Commission officials say the deal has particular significance
because of the crisis of confidence caused by the Danish rejection of the
Maastricht treaty which has put in jeopardy the European Union project.
If agreed, the working time deal would translate Maastricht's agreement to
disagree on social policy into law for the first time. At Maastricht, the 11
put their more ambitious social policy aims into a protocol to the treaty,
leaving the UK subject only to existing social provisions.
These sorts of 'variable geometry' or 'Europe ala carte' deals - whereby
member states can sign up to EC policies which suit them - are anathema to
integrationists who see in them the fragmentation of the Community and
dilution of its force.
But after the Danish rejection, and with Ireland's June 18 referendum
looming, events could move swiftly in favour of a variable speed Europe.
According to senior European Commission officials, all 12 would accept a
48-hour working week under the compromise. But the UK would in effect get 10
years to implement it: the maximum three years for a directive to come into
law plus a seven year transition.
Crucially, the directive would allow those workers willing to work more than
48 hours to do so - the main UK demand. But those workers unwilling to
exceed the prescribed limit would have the protection of the law.
To enforce this, employers would have to keep records of of both categories
of workers, and make these available to national health and safety
authorities, whose job it would be to ensure there was no discrimination.
This basis for compromise followed German representations designed to ensure
the UK was not isolated in the Council of Ministers on June 24 in
Luxembourg, just ahead of the June 26-27 Lisbon summit. It was Germany which
prevented the issue going to a vote on April 30, to allow the
newly-appointed Mrs Gillian Shephard, the UK employment secretary, a 'grace
period'.
Following the Danish referendum result, however, negotiations gathered pace,
Commission officials say, and now centre on today's meeting between Mrs
Shephard and her French counterpart, Ms Martine Aubry, who is one of the
authors of the EC's Social Charter.
If agreement is reached, it would be sealed at a social affairs EC
ministerial meeting on the eve of the Lisbon summit of EC heads of
government, which will be dominated by the Maastricht treaty crisis.
Some thorny problems remain, such as whether working time agreements should
be negotiated at industry level, as the majority of member states want, or
at plant level, as the UK insists.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Major denies cabinet split on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major moved yesterday to quell reports of damaging splits within the
cabinet over the Maastricht treaty.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary and one of the most Euro-sceptic
cabinet ministers, last night released a statement denying he was at odds
with the prime minister over Maastricht.
Speaking in Bogota, Columbia, the prime minister said: 'There is no cabinet
crisis and there is no difference of view whatever among any members of the
cabinet.'
Ministers acknowledged privately, however, that the government is under
pressure from Tory MPs, even in more pro-Europe sections of the party, to
look for greater revisions than it has been prepared to contemplate.
As Labour MPs yesterday voted to keep their options open over tactics on the
Maastricht bill, some Conservatives said the government would be defeated if
the Commons voted on the treaty before the summer recess.
With Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, in France until Friday and Mr Major
in South America, speculation at Westminster of government rifts and
possible resignations has grown - centred on reports that Mr Lilley and Mr
Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, attended a meeting of
Tory Euro-sceptics last week.
Conservative business managers were yesterday warning of 'black propaganda'
by the most radical of Euro-sceptics who, they said, were keen to talk up
the government's dilemma.
So far, the government has hinted at only limited flexibility, in order to
overcome the Danish referendum result. It argues that a renegotiation would
not be to Britain's advantage and could wreck the government's ambitions for
its presidency, which begins on July 1. 'It would be folly to throw away the
gains we have in that treaty rather than building on those gains for the
future,' Mr Major said.
But ministers stressed that the government was playing a waiting game,
pending the outcome of at least the Irish referendum next week and the
Lisbon EC summit at the end of the month. 'All of us are trying to use as
cautious language as possible', one said.
The Foreign Office has already hinted that Britain may try to add an
addendum to the Maastricht treaty reinforcing the principle by which
decisions are made at the lowest appropriate level of government.
Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, underlined his scepticism
about fast moves towards European union, when he said on BBC radio that: 'We
don't want to see ever more resources being taken from individual countries
and appropriated to the centre. . . We want a looser and a broader Europe.'
European finance ministers agreed public opinion could not be ignored, Mr
Lamont said.
In his statement, Mr Lilley said the deal negotiated by the prime minister
at Maastricht 'gives us a good opportunity to shape Europe in the way we
want'.
Meanwhile, a meeting of the Labour parliamentary party yesterday suggested
growing support for rejecting Maastricht among Labour MPs - although the
party leadership succeeded in presenting the party as unified by postponing
a vote until next week at the earliest.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Delors calls for more open EC to head off critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Commission president, Mr Jacques Delors, yesterday called for a
more open, less complicated European Community as an antidote to growing
scepticism about European union.
He was speaking at the first sitting of the European parliament since Danish
voters rejected the Maastricht treaty in a referendum last week.
Mr Delors blamed growing scepticism about closer European union on the EC's
failure to explain itself to a wider public.
Mr Delors is clearly worried about the gathering criticism of the Commission
and the community. In his address on the proposed EC budget - which has come
under attack from member states - he emphasised how much Ireland benefited
from EC funding.
The Irish referendum on Maastricht takes place next week and polls published
yesterday indicated increased opposition to the treaty.
Members of the European parliament glimpsed the impact of the Danes'
implicit criticism of the Commission president's style when Mr Delors
reacted angrily to accusations that he wanted to 'sideline' the community's
smaller member-states.
'That is totally false, totally wrong,' said Mr Delors, unexpectedly
interrupting the emergency debate on the Danish referendum to respond to
specific accusations levelled at him by Ms Nel van Dijk, a Dutch Green MEP.
'I protest very strongly and I think if you say something like that you have
to come along with supporting evidence,' he said.
Rumours that Mr Delors favoured giving more executive power for the
Commission and large member-states in an enlarged community damaged the
pro-EC cause in Denmark in the weeks before the referendum.
Mr Delors had opened the debate on the Danish vote with a calm speech,
tinged with contrition, laying out his views on the impact of, and reasons
for, the Danish vote.
He reasserted his view that the process of ratification of the treaty in the
other 11 member states should continue.
But he added that clarity of legislation, transparency of decision-making
and a particular emphasis on 'subsidiarity' - the devolution of powers to
the most appropriate authority - should be the hallmarks of Community
institutions and governments.
In Paris, however, Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the Belgian prime minister,
described as 'rather worrying' a UK plan to explore the possibility of
limiting the Commission's powers to intervene in national affairs. Mr
Dehaene said his view was shared by French President Francois Mitter-rand.
Mr Delors said that after January 1 1993, the target date for the
implementation of the single European market, the volume of
Commission-generated legislation was bound to diminish. 'We mustn't, for
fear of being unemployed, make new laws just for the fun of it,' he said.
The parliament voted by a large majority to urge member states to continue
the ratification process 'without delay.'
Mr Jean-Pierre Cot, leader of the socialist group in the parliament,
rejected the option of reopening negotiations on the treaty.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Maxwells' MCC share purchasing involvement documented
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOCUMENTS which show for the first time that both Mr Robert Maxwell and his
son Kevin were intimately involved in substantial purchases of shares in
Maxwell Communication Corporation, one of their own public companies, have
been obtained by the Financial Times.
Meanwhile, a director of a secretive Swiss trust, Mr Werner Rechsteiner, has
broken his silence and has admitted that transfers of MCC shares to his
trust, which are at the centre of an investigation by the Serious Fraud
Office, were made on the instructions of Robert Maxwell.
This is the first time that Mr Rechsteiner has given details of the
relationship between his mysterious trust, Yakosa Finanzierungs, and the
Maxwell family.
The FT has also obtained a letter and has seen a corroborating fax which
shows that Mr Kevin Maxwell was intimately involved in the purchase of 9m
shares by Yakosa and a further 16m shares by Servex, another Swiss Trust.
The MCC purchases by Yakosa and Servex are the object of an investigation by
the SFO into an alleged illegal scheme to support the MCC share price.
The SFO is also investigating whether Mr Robert Maxwell or Mr Kevin Maxwell
breached the Companies Act by failing to disclose the purchases of the
shares by the Swiss trusts.
If either had a financial interest in the Swiss trusts, the purchases should
have been disclosed under company law, because they were both directors of
MCC.
The documents demonstrate that Bishopsgate Investment Trust, a private UK
company controlled by the Maxwell family, provided Pounds 55.33m on behalf
of the two Swiss trusts so that they could pay for the MCC shares.
Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, acted as broker to the deals.
Goldman's lawyers are convinced that it acted properly.
Mr Rechsteiner yesterday broke the silence he has maintained since Robert
Maxwell's death in November on the subject of his relationship with the
Maxwell family. He said MCC share purchases had been 'going on for some
time' through Yakosa. He denied that the shares were bought for Yakosa's
'own account'. He said the shares were bought for other 'foundations' and
then 'held for a certain time.'
He also stressed that ownership of the MCC shares no longer rested with
Robert Maxwell once they had been received by Yakosa: 'Yakosa is owned by
the Maxwell Foundation,' he said.
Mr Rechsteiner refused to say who controlled the Maxwell Foundation, which
is based in Liechtenstein, but said it was neither Robert nor Kevin Maxwell.
The FT has however obtained documents showing that Mr Kevin Maxwell was
closely involved in the process of paying for 25m MCC shares on behalf of
two Swiss trusts, Yakosa and Servex.
On May 29 last year, Mr Kevin Maxwell sent a fax to Mr Larry Wood, an
executive director of Goldman Sachs, telling him that two parcels of 12.5m
MCC shares each would be bought by the Swiss trusts with Pounds 55.33m
provided by BIT, a Maxwell private company. The fax, signed by Mr Maxwell,
said that the funds would be remitted to Goldman Sachs 'by Bishopsgate
Investment Trust PLC from its account at National Westminter Bank plc, 41
Lothbury'. Two other faxes sent by Mr Kevin Maxwell to Mr Wood on the same
day show that the former was equally involved in the other end of the
transaction, the sale of the 25m shares.
The Swiss trusts bought the shares, using Goldman as broker, from two
Maxwell pension funds, Maxwell Communication Pension Trustee (Works Scheme)
and Mirror Group Newspaper Pension Trustee (Works Scheme).
Each pension fund sold 12.5m shares at a price of 219.78p a share, or Pounds
27.47m in total. At 6.29pm on May 29, Mr Maxwell sent the two other faxes to
Mr Wood on behalf of the two pension funds.
As a director of MGPT and as a trustee of MCCPT, he told Mr Wood to pay each
pension fund what it was owed to the NatWest account of BIT, which Mr
Maxwell described as 'nominee' for the two pension funds.
In other words, he told Mr Wood that the shares were being bought for the
Swiss trusts with funds provided by BIT and that these funds should then be
sent by Goldman back to BIT.
In the event, on May 31, Goldman received the Pounds 55.3m by wire transfer
in its account at Barclays. Goldman then levied its commission and expenses
on the deal of Pounds 385,000 and wired the remainder back to BIT's NatWest
account.

<TEXT>
A bomb explosion damaged shops close to the House of Commons shortly before
midnight last night, but Scotland Yard said there were no casualties. The
area, around Victoria Street, was sealed off and the Anti-terrorist Squad
called in.
Police said the blast, which followed a phone warning to the BBC, was caused
by a 'very small device' of high explosive placed in a litter bin. There was
only superficial damage to windows.
Labour MP Max Madden, leaving the Commons after a debate on renewing
emergency powers in Northern Ireland, was within 40 yards of the blast. 'It
was quite a loud explosion,' he said.
It was hoped Victoria Street would be open for the morning rush hour.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (7): The competitive
edge - Stock exchanges are locked in battle
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LONDON-based representative of one of the biggest US stock exchanges says
that many of the UK and continental companies he visits are amazed to learn
that there are competing stock exchanges in the US.
Most countries in Europe and south-east Asia have just one stock exchange,
perhaps backed up by a few regional exchanges that service local business
communities. In the US, however, competition among exchanges has never been
more intense than today.
The New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) and the American Stock Exchange (ASE),
headquartered in downtown Manhattan, are the oldest forums for trading
equities in the US. Over the decades, they have been supplemented by
regional exchanges, such as the Pacific Stock Exchange in San Francisco.
In the last two decades, however, the floor-based exchanges have seen their
position undermined. The NYSE has lost large chunks of its market share in
the past decade.
In 1981 more than 75 per cent of the trading in all US stocks was handled by
the NYSE. By last year, that share had dropped to not much more than half,
with overseas markets (mostly London), the regional exchanges, the Nasdaq
electronic market run by the National Association of Securities Dealers
(NASD), and various off-exchange trading systems stealing the rest.
The NYSE's share has been eroded because the nature of securities trading in
the US is changing as technological development and increasing emphasis on
cutting transaction costs refocuses attitudes to stock markets.
The NYSE's main rival is Nasdaq. Unlike the NYSE, which relies on customer
order flow to establish prices, Nasdaq is a dealer-driven market where
market-makers list prices on computer screens at which they are willing to
buy and sell stocks.
Because dealers can trade NYSE-listed stocks on Nasdaq, the NYSE has lost
business to the electronic market. Investors (or their brokers) have a
choice between trading NYSE stocks on the Big Board with its order-driven
pricing mechanism and floor-based trading system, or doing business via
marketmakers on Nasdaq, which claims to execute trades faster and at a lower
cost.
Over the years, a growing number has chosen the Nasdaq route. In 1981, less
than 1 per cent of all trades in NYSE stocks was conducted on Nasdaq. Last
year, that figure had jumped to almost 10 per cent.
Nasdaq is not alone in fighting for NYSE business. Bernard Madoff Investment
Securities, a New York-based Nasdaq dealing firm, has used computer
technology and trading know-how to build a profitable business persuading
broking firms to route their customers' buy and sell orders through its
automated trading system.
Madoff offers a form of refund to broking firms that direct business its
way. In effect, the company pays brokers for any business they bring in.
This way of attracting order flow is used by the regional US exchanges,
which also compete for NYSE business. The Pacific and the Midwest Stock
Exchange have also moved from eliminating commissions on order execution to
pay brokers to bypass the Big Board.
While over-the-counter systems like Nasdaq and Madoff represent what is
known as the 'third market' (the NYSE and the ASE are the 'first market',
and the regional exchanges the 'second market'), the development of
computerised off-exchange trading systems over the past decade has created
extra competition - a 'fourth market'.
The fourth market systems dispense with dealer intermediaries altogether,
providing institutions with an electronic forum where they can deal directly
with each other.
The best known of these crossing networks are Instinet, run by Reuters,
POSIT, which is owned by West Coast broking house Jeffries, and Spaworks, a
trading system set up by a former Kidder Peabody trader, that now operates
under the name of the Arizona Stock Exchange.
All three allow institutional users to post buy and sell orders on screen,
with orders matched and executed electronically by the system's computers at
the end of specified trading sessions.
The fourth market systems are popular with investors. They are cheaper for
big institutions than trading through an NYSE specialist and offer a greater
degree of anonymity.
Both third and fourth markets have their flaws, however. They lack
liquidity, especially at times of crisis. Complaints were made after the
1987 October crash that some marketmakers on Nasdaq's computer system did
not answer telephone calls because they were reluctant to trade in the
middle of a chaotic market. (The NASD now says a marketmaker will always be
available to trade a stock, no matter what the market condition.)
As a result, the spreads between buy and sell prices on third market
networks or fourth market systems are likely to be wider, which means
investors get a worse deal than on floor-based exchanges.
The crossing networks, meanwhile, have been criticised for their lack of
speed in trade execution. Because of the way the systems are set up,
investors' orders are filled only if there are similar-sized and priced
orders on the other side of the transaction, and only then at one of the
various crossing sessions. If investors want to react quickly to news, they
have to go back to the OTC markets or big exchanges.
There is a final element of competition - the fight for listings between the
NYSE, the ASE and Nasdaq. Generally, Nasdaq is known as the market for
small, fast-growth companies seeking their first quotation. The ASE
specialises in mid-capitalisation, solid-growth stocks, while the NYSE is
seen as the market most companies aspire to be listed on when they grow big
enough.
That hierarchy, however, is being challenged. Nasdaq has persuaded some
well-known big companies not to upgrade to the NYSE. Thus, Apple and
Microsoft stick to Nasdaq because of its long association with hi-tech
companies.
The ASE is fighting for Nasdaq's turf by offering a listing for very small
companies, an incubator market known as the Emerging Companies Market. The
NYSE, which still attracts the bulk of the big new listings, has focused its
attention on attracting foreign companies. But its ambitions to be the first
true global exchange are blocked by strict US reporting regulations which
dissuade many big foreign corporations from seeking a US listing.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (8): Move to ease
securities rules / Examining the role of asset-backed debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN ZAGOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A RECENT proposal by the Securities and Exchange Commission, the US
securities watchdog agency, to loosen the rules governing the issuance of
asset-backed securities may prove a welcome boost to the industry in what
promises otherwise to be a static year.
The SEC proposal would exempt issuers of the debt from provisions of the
Investment Company Act of 1940 which regulates mutual funds in the US,
thereby opening the field to a wider range of asset categories so long as
they remain within the bounds of structured transactions and receive one of
the top two investment grades from a rating agency.
At present, home mortgage-backed and auto-loan backed bonds are exempt from
the mutual fund regulations, but junk bonds, backed by more general loans
and some forms of credit-card receivables, are still subject to the mutual
fund rules. The result is a cumbersome process where issuers must apply for
an exemption to the mutual fund rules for each issue.
The SEC's proposal, which is likely to stimulate volume and broaden the
market, comes at a time when growth in asset-backed issuances has slowed to
a virtual crawl after several boom years. The total amount of asset-backed
debt issued, excluding mortgage-backed securities, stood at only Dollars
1.23bn in 1985. Between 1989 and 1990 the amount nearly doubled to Dollars
40.08bn, but grew only 17 per cent to Dollars 46.97bn in 1991 and is
expected to remain fairly static in the coming year at about Dollars 50bn.
Mortgage-backed securities, by far the biggest sector of the asset-backed
securities business, saw volume nearly triple in the first quarter of this
year to Dollars 101bn, thanks to a sharp drop in long-term interest rates
which spurred a wave of mortgage-refinancing. Volume, however, is expected
to taper off as long-term interest rates pick up. Players expect continued
growth in commercial and multi-family deals from the Resolution Trust
Corporation and other sources, however, through the year.
In the credit card-backed securities arena, traditionally the most important
component of the (non-mortgage) asset-backed securities business, volume
slowed in the first quarter of this year and the pace is not expected to
pick up significantly during 1992.
Mr Jack Ross, director and co-head of Merrill Lynch's Asset Backed
Securities group, the biggest on Wall Street followed by First Boston, cites
a number of factors behind the slowdown in supply.
Credit card volume is down for three reasons, according to Mr Ross.
'Firstly, the banks are faring better and have the equity market available
to shore up capital. Secondly, we haven't seen as many credit card
asset-backed deals come due this year, so refinancing volume is not great.
And thirdly, with the recession portfolios are shrinking rather than
growing, so there are fewer assets to securitise.'
Indeed, one of the most important factors in the asset-backed market's
growth during 1990-91 was the relative illiquidity of US banks, when many
had trouble meeting capital standards and turned to off-balance sheet
financing.
One of the biggest areas of activity in the past year was in auto
receivables-backed securities. In addition, new areas to securitise have
also helped shore up volume, such as leases, trade receivables and
commercial loans. Mr Ross says: 'In the auto sector not only have we seen
consumer loans or retail paper securitised, we are now seeing wholesale
paper being securitised with a structure similar to credit card-backed
deals.'
In spite of the fall in credit card business, participants are still
enthusiastic, in part because spreads are tightening. 'Re-offer spreads are
at the tightest levels they have ever been,' says Mr Ross.
Merrill recently did a Dollars 500m MBNA credit card deal priced at a spread
of 55 basis points over the treasury's five-year note. The issue was able to
command an impressive spread partly because of the strength of the MBNA
name, since the Delaware-based business is one of the top US credit-card
issuers.
In addition, Mr Ross believes investors have been impressed by the ability
of credit-card backed portfolios, in general, to withstand increased
consumer losses during the recession. 'They're not getting the downgrades or
early calls so investors are willing to buy at tighter levels,' he says.
Also contributing to the tighter spreads is the renewed strength of the
corporate market. 'Our spreads move in sympathy with the corporate market as
we are a corporate bond alternative,' says Mr Ross.
The improvement in spreads is all the sweeter because of the comparison with
a difficult fourth quarter last year, when spreads started to widen amid
fears that pending legislation to cap credit card interest rates at 14 per
cent would threaten the future of this part of the market. But the proposed
legislation came to nothing and some of the major issuers, including
Citibank and American Express, have now tiered their portfolios, bringing
down the rates for better borrowers.
With the market now maturing, last year asset-backed securities accounted
for 25 per cent of the corporate bond market. And while they may not be able
to command a similar share of the market this year, they have now become
almost as mainstream as general debt or equity financing in the capital
markets arena.
'The asset mix may change from year to year,' says Mr Ross, 'but
asset-backed securities have proved themselves as a product that is here to
stay.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (6): A shrinking share
of a larger pie / A look at the prospects for the country's futures industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US futures industry, once a magical beanstock of growth and a honey-pot
for risk-craving traders, is facing a far less dazzlingly profitable
maturity.
Fast-paced growth is now the province of newer, overseas exchanges. And as
US futures markets have become larger and more liquid and competition has
increased for client business, the bid-ask spreads that make trader's
profits have slimmed and so have the fees for client transactions.
A consensus has grown that the days of fat windfalls, turning ex-taxi driver
traders into overnight millionaires, are over in the US. Simply winning
returns better than the Standard &amp; Poor's 500 is regarded as success these
days.
But, if it has lost a bit of its rude gleam, the US industry has benefited
at the same time. It has made progress in shedding its poor image as a crap
shoot and establishing futures as a legitimate part of virtually every large
investor's portfolio.
Moreover, it still has a number of innovative tricks up its sleeve. For
instance, Chicago, with the world's two largest exchanges, the Chicago Board
of Trade and the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, has been home to the greatest
innovations in the industry - the creation of financial contracts based on
US government bonds (the most actively traded futures in the world), stock
indices and currencies - and remains the best laboratory for new concepts in
futures.
This year, for example, the CBOT is launching insurance futures and hopes to
start a new pollution permits contract next year.
Whatever the fate of those contracts, the US is likely to continue to be the
centre of futures innovation because 'you need big markets to initiate new
products,' says Mr Jack Wing, chief executive officer of Chicago Corp, a
large futures brokerage.
Nevertheless, the US futures industry is vexed that its worldwide market
share has continued to shrink as new foreign exchanges have mushroomed.
Although it thoroughly dominated futures trading around the globe a decade
ago, it claimed just 53.2 per cent of total volume last year.
The American industry as a whole has not enjoyed double digit annual growth
since 1987, when trading volume shot up 24.2 per cent. 'It's a mature
business here and we're not going to see growth like the 1980s,' says Mr
John Damgard, president of the US Futures Industry Association.
According to the FIA's figures, last year for the first time since 1968,
America's 11 exchanges suffered a decline in trading. Volume fell in 1991 by
4.93 per cent.
By comparison, futures trading volume at the Marche a Terme International de
France (Matif) grew last year by 32 per cent, at the London International
Financial Futures Exchange (Liffe) by 13 per cent and at the Osaka
Securities Exchange by 47 per cent.
A renewed upswing of 15 per cent in trading volume on American exchanges
from January to April this year promises to deliver at least single-digit
annual growth again. But the long-term trend of a smaller piece of a much
larger international futures pie, given the proliferation of futures
exchanges, is unlikely to be reversed.
While the exchanges themselves are most hurt by the diminished market share,
large US-based futures traders welcome the overseas markets. They are
willing to trade anywhere and the new markets offer them more diversity of
product and trading environments that are less restrictive than the US.
For the moment, most products on foreign exchanges are not competing head to
head with those on US exchanges. They tend to be indigenous, with a firmer
local than global market, though an internationalisation has already begun
to occur in Europe and could hasten as the Community's integration
progresses. Thus, for instance, Liffe has contracts on both the Italian and
German governments' bonds and trades the US government bond as well.
One remedy to boost volume for the US exchanges is the advent of
round-the-clock trading, which they will pioneer with the electronic system
known as Globex. Long-awaited, and with its start postponed successively for
three years, Globex is due to be launched on June 25. Developed jointly by
the Chicago Mercantile Exchange, the CBOT and Reuters, the system could mean
that those contracts it lists will benefit in trading volume from giving
off-hour access to traders around the globe.
So far, select products from the two Chicago exchanges and Matif, Globex's
only international partner exchange, are to be listed. This year, the CME's
currency, Eurodollar and one-month Libor contracts and the CBOT's Treasury
bond and two-, five- and 10-year treasury notes contracts will be listed,
followed by Matif's 10-year Notional bond, seven-year Ecu interest rate,
three-month Pibor rate and CAC-40 stock index contracts.
Four New York exchanges have agreed in principle to join the system, though
final approval of their affiliation is still being worked out.
Beyond bringing a rise in volume, the Globex system is also widely
considered a possible harbinger of the industry's likely electronic future.
Though many exchanges, even some of the newest, believe firmly in open
outcry pit trading as the best, most efficient style, screen trading seems
to be exerting a strong undertow on this orthodoxy.
The shape of the markets over this decade will also continue to be deeply
affected by the entry of large institutional players. Since the early 1980s,
this trend has been gathering steam. Every large Wall Street investment bank
and stock brokerage now has a futures arm of some sort.
Just as mutual funds have come to play a major role in the stock markets,
managed futures funds, currently holding an estimated Dollars 21bn, are
increasingly important in futures markets. Futures have become very much a
professionals market, with retail business accounting for only an estimated
3 per cent of trading.
Many in the industry who have come out of the equities business have a
strong sense of deja vu. Mr Wing, for example, says: 'One is struck by the
similarities.' This in itself is testimony to how mainstream the futures
business has become. One veteran futures hand, pining for the salad days,
recently complained that big institutional traders 'have gotten a taste of
being part of the establishment and now they're a stuffy, co-opted
conservative bunch.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (9): Steady stream of
smaller deals - Mergers and Acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TAKEOVER ACTIVITY in the US is sharply lower than in the boom days of the
late-1980s, and has changed substantially in character, with relatively few
blockbuster deals but a steady stream of much smaller acquisitions and
disposals.
In 1991, deals worth Dollars 116.7bn were completed in the US, down sharply
from the Dollars 169.4bn of 1990 and the Dollars 263.8bn record reached in
1988.
The main reason for the drop is the much less favourable financing climate.
Junk bonds, the main weapon used to fund bids in the 1980s, have fallen from
grace, while the problems of the banking sector mean that borrowing from
this quarter to fund takeovers is not very easy.
The corporate raiders - financiers backed by junk bonds - who made much of
the running during the takeover boom are now largely discredited, while
recession has made many corporations concentrate more on the efficient
running of their existing operations than indulge in takeovers.
Some large takeovers are still being done, but they tend to have particular
characteristics:
They are agreed, rather than unfriendly. There has not been a large hostile
bid in the US for almost a year.
They tend to be within a sector, rather than across sectoral boundaries, and
have a strong industrial logic. They are particularly concentrated in three
sectors going through major restructuring - banking, defence and
telecommunications.
They tend to involve more equity, relative to debt, than deals done in the
1980s, and many of them involve pure swaps of shares in one company for
those of another. A recent example is the proposed takeover of Centel, a
large Chicago-based local telecommunications company by Sprint, a
long-distance carrier, which involves a highly controversial share exchange
pitched well below what many analysts think the company is worth.
The bid activity is largely domestic. It involves relatively few large US
bids for foreign companies and only the occasional foreign bid in the US.
British, French and Japanese companies were extremely active in the US
takeover market in the late 1980s and the French remained so right up until
last year. But now this has slowed to a trickle as their domestic economies
have turned down and, in the case of Japan, as they have seen many
disappointing results from acquired US operations.
However, there remains a reasonably lively takeover market in relatively
small companies - both within the US and across national boundaries. While
the value of US deals dropped 31 per cent last year, the number fell by only
19 per cent and at 3,268 was well above the 2,752 recorded in 1988, when the
value of bids peaked.
Many companies, moreover, now seem more interested in entering joint
ventures, or acquiring a minority stake in a business, than taking on the
risks of a full bid straight away.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (4): The vulture
investors make money out of bankruptcies / A look at the growth in the use
of Chapter 11 protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BIDS ARE out; bankruptcies and restructurings are in. That may be a crude
oversimplication of the shift in business trends between the 1980s and
1990s, but it carries a large measure of truth.
For the US investment community - from bankers to lawyers - this sea-change
has meant a substantial reallocation of resources. M&amp;A departments have been
scaled down, while restructuring teams have been built up. Arbitrage
activities have been reduced, while 'vulture funds' (which invest in
distressed securities or bankrutpcy claims) have been either expanded or
launched. And so on.
All of which reflects a bankruptcy process which is substantially different
from that generally pertaining in the UK. One of the US's more endearing
philosophical commitments is to 'the right to a new life' - an axiom which
dates back to the Pilgrim Fathers. In the narrow context of corporate
affairs, this has evolved into the 1978 US Bankruptcy Code and its 'Chapter
11' process.
Very broadly, this allows a company to file for court protection from its
creditors. Assuming the courts agree, the company's assets cannot then be
seized; the debtor is allowed to suspend certain interest and debt
repayments and to cancel certain contracts; legal suits against the debtor
can be pursued only as claims through the bankruptcy court.
Once Chapter 11 protection is operative, the debtor and its creditors - who
usually form a 'committee' to represent often-disparate interests  - try to
agree on a restructuring plan. This may involve the sale of assets, creating
a cash pool which can be used to pay claims, at least in part. But creditors
are usually offered some interest in the ongoing business as well.
Reasons for the growth in the usage of Chapter 11 are largely self-evident -
the recessionary climate and the large amounts of debt taken on by many US
corporations during the 1980s. To a lesser extent, some companies have found
the ability to abrogate contracts useful and others - such as Manville -
have filed in the face of massive legal claims.
The bankruptcy process often looks attractive to non-US observers. After
all, jobs are preserved and, in the most successful cases, creditors have
enjoyed substantial recoveries. The downside is the time and money which
Chapter 11 can eat up; some cases have dragged on for over half a decade,
and fees can consume hundred of millions of dollars from the debtor's
estate. LTV, the steel company, is a good example: fees are estimated at
over Dollars 150m during a stay in bankruptcy which has now dragged into its
sixth year.
Already, some judges are scrutinising expenses intently - in turn, making
bankruptcy work far less lucrative for the professionals than, say, bid
activity. In the Southmark case, for example, the judge chopped Dollars 3m
off a Dollars 54m bill. The potentially litigious Drexel bankruptcy,
meanwhile, was hassled along by a ruthless octogenarian, Judge Milton
Pollack. As a result, the bankruptcy was completed in two years, a time
limit few thought possible when the proceedings began.
Suggestions over how the Chapter 11 process might be reformed to reduce time
and expense vary widely. However, one commonly voiced notion is to shorten
the 'exclusivity period' - that is, the window when the debtor has the sole
right to produce a reorganisation plan. By giving the creditors an entree
earlier in the proceedings, some lawyers argue, months could be clipped
away.
A more controversial 'time-saver' is the pre-packaged bankruptcy - used, for
example, by Mr Donald Trump with his Taj Mahal casino property. Here,
debtors and creditors in effect agree on a restructuring plan before the
Chapter 11 filing is made. Chapter 11 is then used to implement the
restructuring scheme, and the debtor's stay in bankruptcy is confined to a
few months. But it is arguable whether this is how the process was meant to
be used.
In some cases, the presence of professional bankruptcy investors can also
speed matters along. Since most claims are transferable, 'vulture investing'
has become a fairly sizeable industry - with players ranging from
specialists Mr Michael Price at Mutual Shares and Mr Sam Zell at the
Zell/Chilmark funds, to mainstream fund management group T. Rowe Price and
to former corporate raider Mr Carl Icahn.
Even Goldman Sachs got in on the act, raising its Dollars 783m Water Street
fund in 1990, but then aborting the project when conflicts of interest
surfaced. Foreign investors have not been bypassed, either: Credit Lyonnais
has backed Apollo Partners, the restructuring business run by Mr Leon Black,
formerly an investment banker at Drexel Burnham Lambert. Together, the
French bank and Apollo acquired most of the junk holdings of Executive Life,
the Californian insurer. The book value of the portfolio was over Dollars
5.3bn.
By giving creditors a potential market for their claims, and bringing
well-honed negotiating skills to the restructuring process, these investors
arguably serve a useful purpose. Final labour negotiations in the
long-running Wheeling-Pittsburgh bankruptcy, for example, were oiled by Mr
Ron LaBow - who had acquired virtually all the bank claims and stood to
become the major equity holder under the steel company's reorganisation
plan.
It is not just vulture investors who have been making money out of
bankruptcies. Another lucrative spin-off business has been the provision of
debtor-in-possession financing. DIP loans are new facilities provided to
companies once there have filed for bankruptcy protection. These usually
rank at the forefront of the creditors' queue for repayment, should the
company be forced to liquidate - so security is relatively good. Yet terms
are usually attractive to the lender - earning 2 to 4 per cent above a
standard business loan, with perhaps 3 per cent upfront as a fee.
Conversely, it is not the cost of bankruptcies which provokes criticism. The
process leaves much to the discretion of judges, and some are felt to be
more sympathetic to a debtor's position than others. It has been argued, for
example, that this explains a number of filings in Delaware, where there is
just one bankruptcy court judge, so the debtor knows at the outset who will
be assigned to the case.
But perhaps the biggest question-mark hanging over the process is its effect
on other healthy companies operating in the same sector. By keeping a
bankrupt company alive - and, indeed, giving it some operating advantages -
industrywide distortions can occur. This has been most marked in the airline
industry, where bankrupt carriers have undercut hugely, in a desperate
attempt to secure cashflow (regardless of profitability). Some relatively
sound airlines have been obliged to match this competitive pricing - and the
sector generally has faced a flood of red ink.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (3): The race to take
advantage of cheaper credit - The Fixed Income Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID THE lowest domestic interest rates in almost 30 years, refunding has
been the dominant financial trend in the US economy over the past year and a
half.
From a micro to a macro level, from individuals with their mortgages to
local governments with their municipal bonds, the race has been on to take
advantage of cheaper credit by replacing old, high interest-paying debt,
with new, low-interest paying debt.
In the corporate fixed-income market, refundings have run at unprecedented
levels for more than a year. Although it is not possible to get exact
statistics, industry analysts estimate that 20 per cent of all corporate
debt issued in 1991 resulted from companies seeking funds at lower costs
than their debt outstanding by calling in their bonds and issuing new,
lower-yielding paper. And so far this year, at least 25 per cent of all
bonds issued by US companies is estimated to be linked to debt refinancing.
Analysts at the US Securities Industry Association (SIA), have looked at the
figures from a broader perspective, by researching the use of proceeds from
debt issues. They have calculated that as much as 35 per cent of the new
debt issued last year was used to retire outstanding debt, which includes
both bonds and other debt such as bank loans.
When combined with issues of new debt, refundings have taken total bond
issuance to record levels.
In 1991 the total value of corporate bonds underwritten in the US broke
through the Dollars  1/2 trillion barrier, reaching Dollars 507bn, a 74 per
cent increase on 1990. The vast majority of corporate bonds (almost Dollars
300bn) were issued in the form of asset-backed securities (mostly mortgage-
and credit card-backed securities), which allow deposit-taking institutions
to remove liabilities from their balance sheets and lower their regulatory
capital requirements.
The value of the remaining 'pure' corporate bonds, meanwhile, reached a
record Dollars 208bn, almost a third more than the previous record set in
1986.
Although few thought it possible at the end of last year, 1991's record pace
of growth is being surpassed. Total corporate debt issuance in the first
quarter of 1992 jumped from last year's opening three-monthly record of
Dollars 135.5bn to Dollars 190bn, a 40 per cent rise.
Excluding asset-backed and junk debt, a total of Dollars 67bn in
investment-grade debt was sold in the first quarter of this year. What set
off this landslide of new issues was the Federal Reserve's most recent, and
biggest, interest rate cut on December 20 last year. In one month - January
1992 - Dollars 35bn in new investment-grade debt was sold.
The majority of new issues has been of investment-grade quality. According
to Securities Data, approximately Dollars 132bn of the Dollars 165bn of
corporate issues with a Standard &amp; Poor's rating sold last year came from
companies with a A- rating or above. In the first five months of this year,
just over Dollars 60bn of the Dollars 95bn in S&amp;P rated issues had a A-
rating or better.
That is not to say that non-investment grade, or junk debt, has languished
entirely. Last year Dollars 10bn in new junk debt was issued; in the first
quarter of this year alone almost Dollars 7bn has come to the market.
Although these numbers are well below the Dollars 30bn that was issued at
the height of the junk bond era in 1986, there has been a revival in
interest among investors seeking higher yields.
Other than the size of issues, the main difference in the junk market today
compared to the mid-1980s is the type of company selling the paper, and the
use the proceeds are being put to. Unlike the industrial giants of the
Michael Milken era who leveraged balance sheets to finance acquisitions,
today's issuers are smaller, fast-growth companies seeking capital for
business expansion. In all respects, therefore, on both the buy and sell
side, the junk market is a much more respectable place today than it was six
years ago.
The steepness of the yield curve (caused by interest rates falling faster at
the short than the long end) has meant maturities on corporate debt have
tended toward the medium and short end of the range.
Last year, three-quarters of all new debt was dated between one and 10
years, and the spread of maturities has been much the same so far this year.
With interest rates at the long end edging higher as economic activity picks
up, this trend is likely to carry on for the rest of the year.
In terms of the type of debt issued, innovation has been rare this past 18
months, primarily because with the financial climate so positive, and demand
so strong, there has been no need for corporates to package their paper in
fancy ways to get it sold. With the straight debt market offering the lowest
yields, plain vanilla has been the flavour of choice.
On the demand side, companies have been able to issue new bonds at record
levels because the appetites of investors for corporate paper has been
almost insatiable, especially in the first quarter of this year. According
to the SIA, institutional net purchases of corporate bonds last year more
than doubled to Dollars 1.96bn a day. In the opening three months of this
year, daily purchases reached a staggering Dollars 3.6bn.
In fact, so strong was the demand early this year from institutions and bond
funds that the huge volume of new bonds was absorbed without spreads
widening.
The interest rate environment again favoured corporate issuers. Investors
unhappy with the 3 to 4 per cent available in CDs, savings and money market
accounts went in search of higher yields. For those which stayed away from
equities and governments, corporate bonds were the obvious answer, with bond
funds able to offer upwards of 8 per cent, depending on credit quality.
While falling interest rates were a boon to debt-laden and expansion-minded
companies, Wall Street's securities houses have had even more reason to
rejoice.
After almost half a decade of seeing its underwriting fees decline each
year, Wall Street finally hit the jackpot in 1991. Although the bulk of the
total Dollars 4.66bn of fees earned last year came from stock underwritings,
the debt side of the business still brought in a healthy Dollars 1.3bn of
fees, up 63 per cent on 1990.
Of the securities houses that manage and underwrite corporate bond issues,
Goldman Sachs, Merrill Lynch and Morgan Stanley have been the biggest powers
on Wall Street, along with Salomon Brothers, the bond giant which has been
damaged by the fall-out from the Treasury auction scandal but which has
benefited from its strong presence in the asset-backed securitisation
business.
The outlook for the corporate fixed-income market is rosy. Interest rates
may rise, but it is unlikely (especially in an election year) that they will
go much higher, so the growth of interest rate/refunding-driven issues
should maintain a decent pace. The economic recovery, meanwhile, is picking
up speed, which means more companies will need extra capital to fund
expansion and meet increased demand.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (5): Deep hole of
over-supply - Property market and bad debt provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   CALL IT bad timing
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
or a change in market prospects. This spring, just when Wall Street
investors had convinced themselves it was safe to begin building up their
shareholdings in major bank stocks, the world's biggest property developer
began filing for bankruptcy protection in Canada and the US.
The parlous state of Olympia &amp; York has sent a shiver through the US
commercial property market. It has also reminded investors that some of the
very US commercial banks that had been deemed to be on the recovery path
might still face substantial bad debt provisions and loan write-offs from
their property loan portfolios.
In the same week last month that saw Olympia &amp; York place its Canary Wharf
project into administration in London, a couple of gloomy analyst reports in
New York warned that bankers might yet suffer more pain from the continuing
US commercial property slump.
The commercial property team at Salomon Brothers in New York said the stage
was set for 'a modest, but painful recovery' in the US office market. But
noting that the market presently faced a glut of supply equal to 12 years of
available office space, Salomon argued that the property market 'is so deep
in the hole of over-supply that it will take many years to climb out'.
If there were any doubts as to the possible implications of this gloomy
outlook, Standard &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, spelt out the bad
news. Calling the Olympia &amp; York bankruptcy filings 'a vivid confirmation'
that property markets had not truly begun to recover or stabilise, S&amp;P
warned that the problem loan work-out period would be protracted and that
the losses for banks would 'have a long tail, reaching substantially higher
levels than they have to date'.
Ms Tanya Azarchs, the S&amp;P banking analyst, declared that bad debt provisions
as of late May were not yet adequate to cover expected losses on property
loan portfolios at many banks in the US. She added that while additional
reserve requirements generally appeared to be manageable, the overhang of
losses would continue to be a significant drain on banking sector earnings
over the next few years.
This situation, S&amp;P explained, would probably delay ratings increases for
many in the banking industry. That, in turn, could hamper the ability of
some US banks to raise cash by way of new securities offerings, especially
if such lower-rated banks were competing on the world capital markets
against higher-rated foreign banks such as Deutsche Bank, the German
powerhouse.
The S&amp;P analysis was termed over-pessimistic by some, but it came less than
three months after the top executives at Citicorp, Chemical and Chase
Manhattan all said they expected their 1992 bad debt provisions to be at
about the same levels as last year, mainly because of the depressed US
commercial property sector.
By the middle of April, as a number of banks reported a recovery in first
quarter earnings, market sentiment became somewhat more bullish again. After
all, the Federal Reserve had acted to lower interest rates and to ease the
reserve requirements in order to help banks strengthen capital ratios.
But the message from the property market in recent weeks has been that the
situation could deteriorate again.
Mr George Salem, a banking analyst at Prudential Securities, recently
recommended that investors sell their stock in BankAmerica, Wells Fargo,
Citicorp and First Chicago; in each case Mr Salem's concerns about
commercial property loan losses was a motivating factor.
Mr David Shulman, a managing director of Salomon Brothers, went even further
than Standard &amp; Poor's: 'I don't think the reserves for non-performing
commercial real estate assets are sufficient at many banks. I think eventual
write-offs at some institutions could range between 30 and 50 per cent of
the outstandings.'
Yet investors on the New York Stock Exchange have been returning to bank
shares at a consistent pace in recent months, assuming the worst is over and
buying stock at reduced prices. But Mr Shulman says: 'The stock market is
viewing the property issue as last year's problem. I think the stock market
has got it wrong.'
Commercial property loan exposure is the single most important issue that
could influence the earnings and stock market performances of US banks. And
there are a series of other factors that will be watched closely in coming
months.
Congress failed last year to approve bank reform legislation that would
allow interstate branching, a move that could help reduce administrative
overheads and other costs. But few expect such legislation to come up for
consideration until after November's presidential election.
The infamous 'credit crunch' - the period over the past 18 months during
which bankers have been accused of refusing to make many new loans to
commerce and industry - seems to be over. But loan demand remains extremely
weak in many parts of the US. Healthy demand for loans may not return until
much later in the economic recovery cycle.
Mergers between sizeable institutions got under way in earnest last year,
with three big combinations - BankAmerica and Security Pacific,
Manufacturers Hanover Trust and Chemical Bank and NCNB and C &amp; S/Sovran  -
helping to consolidate the industry.
This year has seen a rash of smaller deals, including two Dollars 1bn
takeovers by regional banks such as Banc One of Ohio and Barnett of Florida.
But the industry still needs more mergers if it is to continue to
rationalise across the national market.
Capital ratios, which were criticised by regulators two years ago as being
inadequate at many banks, are being strengthened, with some exceptions. But
more big property loan write-offs could affect the speed with which banks
carry on bolstering their capital bases.
Looking ahead, it appears that the US commercial banking industry may slog
through a problematic 1992. The worst of the industry's crisis may well be
over, but there is still the prospect of unpleasant surprises.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (2): Upsurge in equity
issues as Wall Street scents recovery - Bumper underwriting fees are being
earned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO SAY that the corporate America has been cashing in on record stock market
levels would be an understatement.
During 1991, total US equity issues reached a record Dollars 56bn - almost
three times the level seen in the previous year. The current 12 months got
off to a similar start: total equity issues, including preferred stock,
reached Dollars 29bn in the first three months, and the pace has appeared to
slacken only slightly in the second quarter.
This upsurge has been mirrored in the area of 'initial public offerings' -
that is, companies floating their shares for the first time. IPOs rose to a
heady Dollars 18.3bn in 1986, the year before stock markets crashed round
the world, but for the next three years, the annual figure barely topped
Dollars 6bn. Then in 1991, it spurted upwards, to Dollars 16.3bn. In the
first quarter of 1992, it reached Dollars 11bn.
The reason for this flood of new equity is simple. Wall Street has been
scenting the economic recovery for well over a year and marking share prices
up in advance of the hoped-for earnings improvement. Historic price-earnings
multiples are, therefore, high.
Meanwhile, a high proportion of companies has balance sheets which are still
burdened by debts taken on during the 1980s, when leverage was fashionable
and credit easy. The desire to restructure balance sheets is, consequently,
widespread. Although low interest rates have meant that part of this
financial overhaul has centred on revised debt arrangements, the replacement
of debt by equity has been another crucial ingredient.
On top of this, certain cyclical industries are lagging behind Wall Street's
optimism. These would certainly include the airline sector, which has
stacked up after-tax losses of Dollars 5bn-plus in the past two years and
may well remain in the red in 1992, and the car industry. Here, searing
losses have dented corporate liquidity, giving companies another incentive
to raise new funds.
The list of major corporations which, for either or both of these reasons,
have tapped equity investors is extremely long. Among the most prominent has
been General Motors, which only last month raised Dollars 2.14bn (before
expenses). This was the largest stock offering to investors ever seen in US.
In terms of sums raised, nevertheless, it was beaten by the Dollars 2.8bn
Time Warner rights issue - where the company's existing shareholders were
invited to subscribe for new shares. Rights issues are rare in the US, and
Time Warner's first proposal - which incorporated a sliding subscription
price depending upon shareholder demand - had to be scrapped after it was
deemed coercive. A conventional fixed price offering was scheduled instead.
That has not been the only investment banking innovation to hit the market
in the past 12 months - although some 'new products' have been more warmly
received. A good deal of publicity, for example, has attached to 'Percs' - a
type of quasi-equity developed by Morgan Stanley.
Percs - the name stands for preferred equity redemption cumulative stock -
are sold at the market price of the common stock, and are mandatorily
convertible at the end of three years. They pay a higher dividend than
ordinary shares, but the amount of capital appreciation which holders can
enjoy is capped, usually at 30 per cent.
In short, for issuers they are less dilutive, although higher-yielding, than
common stock; for investors, there is a better income flow, but capital gain
is pegged. RJR Nabisco - which has been steadily restructuring its balance
sheet since the Dollars 25bn buyout - took advantage of this hybrid in
significant fashion, as did General Motors and K Mart.
driven by broadly similar considerations - with a good number of issues
being former leveraged buyouts now returning to the public marketplace. This
wave has ebbed somewhat in recent weeks and some issues have been cancelled,
with fund managers wailing about the amount of prospectus-reading which has
been required.
Nevertheless, new potential flotation candidates are still filing with the
Securities and Exchange Commission - perhaps in the hope of catching the
boat before it departs. At the end of last month, for example, Revlon -
taken private by former corporate raider, Mr Ronald Perelman in the 1980s -
announced that it was packaging most of its cosmetics business into a new
subsidiary and would float a minority interest in this to investors.
In the insurance sector, the Equitable, one of the nation's largest life
insurers, filed for a stock offering on the same day. This would allow the
insurer to shed its mutual status and turn itself into a shareholder-owned
company, raising sorely-needed capital on the way. If the Equitable scheme
is successful, some pundits believe that other ailing insurers may follow
suit.
This wave of new issues has, of course, meant bumper underwriting fees for
Wall Street firms. According to IDD, they posted a 140 per cent increase in
aggregate disclosed underwriting fees last year, after a 40 per cent decline
in 1990. Total fees amounted to Dollars 4.66bn, up from only Dollars 1.94bn
a year earlier, and just shy of the record Dollars 5.04bn seen in 1986.
Fees from underwriting debt securities rose from Dollars 806.3m to Dollars
1.32bn, but the increase on the equity front was even more marked.
Underwriting fees from common stock issues nearly trebled, from Dollars
1.05bn to Dollars 2.85bn, while fees from preferred stock issues increased
from Dollars 66.2m to Dollars 489.4m. The first few months of this year
indicate that 1992 could be better still.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Survey of US Finance and Investment (1): A four-letter word:
debt - Corporate America has been undergoing a restructuring of its balance
sheet over the past year, swapping the heavy debt burden of the 1980s for
equity or fixed income paper with lower rates of interest
</HEADLINE>

   THE RESTRUCTURING of Corporate America's balance sheet
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the most important change in US financial markets over the past two years -
is continuing apace as the nation adjusts from the financial excesses of the
1980s.
Helped by a stock market boom and falling interest rates, US companies have
been rushing to issue new equity and cut their debt, or refinance their
existing borrowings on more favourable terms.
Most have been able to do so in an orderly fashion, yet others facing
cash-flow crises have had to seek the protection of the bankruptcy courts
for their restructurings. Companies which have filed for Chapter 11
bankruptcy protection since the start of the year include Macy's, the New
York-based department store chain, and parts of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian
property group.
These trends still have some way to run. The wave of corporate bankruptcies
seems past its peak, and should continue to diminish if the US economy
sustains its slow recovery from the 1991 recession. But this will doubtless
be accompanied by some further high profile disasters. The Olympia &amp; York
debacle is a reminder of the extreme fragility of the North American
property market.
The substitution of equity for debt is also incomplete. After all, 1991 was
only the first time in eight years that US corporations issued more stock
than they retired. But the pace of change could slow as the year advances:
investors are getting more choosy about the equity they buy and the stock
market is looking very generously valued.
There could be a substantial market correction over the next few months,
especially if the trend of interest rates begins to rise consistently, a
development which could also stem the flow of debt issues.
Nevertheless, the net effect of these changes will eventually be a much
healthier US business environment, as well as some very fat fees for the
Wall Street investment banks and law firms which, cynics note, also reaped
handsome rewards advising their clients during the great debt and takeover
booms of the 1980s.
Wall Street enjoyed bumper profits in 1991, thanks largely to the flood of
new issues, and sustained this through the first quarter of this year.
However, one house was conspicuously absent from the feast: Salomon
Brothers, which was hit last August by a scandal over its behaviour during
auctions of US treasury bonds. That led to a change of the company's top
management and a long investigation by the Securities and Exchange
Commission which ended last month in Dollars 290m of fines and restitution
for Salomon.
While the SEC investigation continued, many companies were unwilling to give
Salomon a mandate to lead-manage share issues, or advise on delicate
takeover work, and the firm's profits suffered accordingly. Still, even
Salomon recorded its third most profitable quarter in the first three months
of this year.
America's commercial banks, while enjoying no such profits bonanza, are at
least slowly emerging from the crisis they faced when the US plunged into
recession and the property and leveraged buy-out bubbles of the 1980s burst.
The banks have ingested large doses of medicine, including heavy bad debt
provisions, slashed dividends, the sale of non-essential assets and large
cuts in their bloated operating costs. And they have been greatly aided by
the Federal Reserve's easing of interest rates, which has allowed them to
improve their net interest margin - the difference between what banks pay to
borrow funds and what they charge to lend money.
Mr Gerald Corrigan, president of the New York Fed, noted recently that the
vast majority of the big US banks' risk-based capital ratios are now well in
excess of the minimums set by the Bank for International Settlements, 'a
result many observers would have regarded as unreachable only a few years
ago'.
But despite tentative signs that some regional banks are becoming more ready
to add to their loan portfolios, the banking recovery is likely to remain
subdued, because of the severe problems still facing the property sector.
A key question for the banking industry over the next two years is whether
efforts to reform the US banking system, which largely came to nothing in
1991, will get a second wind following November's presidential election.
Bankers are hopeful that Congress might permit branch banking across state
lines, which would allow the industry to rationalise its cost structure,
although abolition of the long-standing ban on banks entering the securities
business still seems far away.
Whatever the politicians' decision on inter-state banking, the industry will
continue its consolidation wave in an attempt to cut costs and improve
efficiency. The past year has seen a sharp increase in this trend, with
mergers bringing together New York's Chemical Bank and Manufacturers
Hanover, California's BankAmerica and Security Pacific, and the South's NCNB
and C&amp;S Sovran.
Wall Street's mergers and acquisitions experts, the investment banking
glamour boys of the 1980s, must be very thankful to the banking sector for
all these marriages, since takeover activity in general has fallen sharply
over the past two years.
The corporate raiders who made much of the running in the 1980s are now
largely discredited and cannot raise funds readily, while many industrial
companies are more concerned to improve the efficiency of their businesses
rather than make large acquisitions.
The deals that do go through are all agreed - there has not been a big
hostile bid in the US for a year - and tend to be medium-sized, strategic
acquisitions. One source of such deals over the next few years will be the
US defence industry, which is in the early stages of a tricky
rationalisation in response to declining Pentagon spending on hardware.
These trends have meant a withering of the size and prestige of Wall
Street's mergers and acquisitions departments, and a concomitant increase in
the influence of advisers on debt, equity and other instruments, as well as
corporate restructurings.
Total US financing volume reached a record Dollars 586bn in 1991, up 88 per
cent on 1990, itself a record year, and the trend continued in the first
quarter of this year, with Dollars 216bn of new issues, some 37 per cent of
last year's total.
Apart from heavy issuance of debt and equity, the market has also seen
continued growth in asset-backed securities - instruments which rely on cash
flow from pools of assets, such as credit card receivables, to pay investors
principal and interest.
For issuers this market provides not only easily available funds - even for
those with otherwise problematic credit ratings - but a means of taking
assets off the balance sheet and improving capital ratios. It is hardly
surprising that banks have been the largest issuers, though the
strengthening of their balance sheets was probably the main cause of a first
quarter slowdown in new issuance.
At the same time, Wall Street is busily trying to bring to the market
innovative new debt and equity products, many of them designed to relocate
or reduce risk.
The past year, for example, has seen a resurgence of interest in 'hybrid'
debt securities which combine conventional borrowing instruments with
derivatives such as swaps or options.
But for all this activity, many analysts doubt that the coming decade can
hope to match the extraordinary boom in financial innovation of the past
two.
As Mr Merton Miller, Nobel prize-winning economist at the Chicago Business
School, pointed out recently: 'In the avant-garde academic literature of
economics and finance today, few signs can be seen of new ideas and concepts
like those that bubbled up in the 1960s and 1970s and came to fruition later
in specific innovations.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Early advance fades in later trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOOD brightened in the UK stock market yesterday morning, but it was
soon clear that this was little more than a technical response from an
oversold equity sector. The lead, yet again, came from the stock index
futures and from a handful of corporate results, but increased market
turnover reflected activity in only a very few shares.
London opened lower in the face of Wall Street's weakness overnight but was
rescued by a firm opening in the June future on the FT-SE Index. An early
loss of more than eight points in the Footsie was quickly converted into a
gain of 11.6, with the Index only three points under the 2,650 testing level
at mid-session.
Sentiment was also helped by unexpectedly excellent figures from Racal
Electronics, which traded very heavily after exceeding the forecasts given
at the time of the defence against the bid from Williams Holdings.
Traders stressed that much of the initial recovery reflected the heavily
oversold positions detected in the previous session. Once these positions
had been resolved, often by way of the stock index futures market, share
prices struggled to hold their initial levels.
The market lost heart in the second half of the day and was additionally
discouraged by a slow start to the new session on Wall Street, which is
still a cause for discomfort in London.
At the close, the FT-SE Index was only 0.7 higher on the day at 2,636.1,
with the 2,650 level still out of reach and the 2,600 mark uncomfortably
close. Seaq-reported turnover remained high, although the day's total of
472.5m shares compared with 488.3m in the previous session.
Political factors continued to loom over the UK stock market, with the
dangers of further developments on the Maastricht front high on the list of
causes for anxiety. Analysts remain relatively confident over the medium
term outlook for equities in London but are nervous over the immediate
future.
Among banking stocks, Midland edged higher after the London market's success
in pre-empting the overnight fall in shares of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking
in far eastern securities markets. Lloyds Bank closed a shade easier as
investors continued to assess the situation in the light of the bank's
withdrawal from the battle for control of Midland. Other banking stocks
lacked buyers, reflecting the reduction of bid tensions in the sector.
With the pound still showing little recovery within the ERM range, and the
dollar steady, the international blue chips turned in a mixed performance.
Oil shares could make little progress against the backcloth of a weak US
market, and the pharmaceuticals also lacked thrust.
The London Stock Exchange announced yesterday that, following the quarterly
review of components of the FT-SE 100 Share Index, Carlton Communications,
Royal Insurance, and Granada Group will join the Footsie list, with effect
from June 22, while Laporte, Eurotunnel and MEPC will will leave the Index
list.

FT  11 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEAR closing and buying mainly by US houses pulled stock index futures out
of the doldrums and helped underpin trading in the underlying cash market,
writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE opened firmly around the 2644 level and
quickly moved forward, helped by bear closing and demand from US houses,
reaching the day's peak of 2,656 by mid morning.
After a period of sideways trading, June drifted lower over the lunch period
in anticipation of an easier Wall Street. The poor opening on Wall Street
led to increased selling of June causing a further retreat, though a squeeze
towards the end saw the contract recover some ground.
In contrast to the first two days of this week, the contract spent most of
the session at a premium to fair value. Dealers once again pointed to the
increased activity in September delivery in which over 2,000 lots were
dealt.
June closed at 2,649, up 11 on the previous session and around 7 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 7. Turnover reached
7,257 lots.
Traded options remained dull with turnover reaching 27,914 contracts. FT-SE
option volume at 7,876 was also poor.
British Airways was the busiest stock option with 1,656 lots dealt. This was
followed by Lasmo at 1,509 contracts.

FT  11 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Racal strong on results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LONG-STANDING worries that Racal Electronics would not reach the profits
forecast of Pounds 50m, made at the time of the failed bid by Williams
Holdings, were shot to pieces as the group posted profits of Pounds 55.6m,
compared with a previous year's loss of Pounds 21.8m.
The profits were well in excess of the most optimistic forecasts which
ranged up to Pounds 52m and were accompanied by the expected details of the
demerger of the Chubb security business, likely to be floated in October.
Racal shares powered ahead in exceptionally heavy trading, eventually
closing a net 5 1/4 higher at 69 1/4 p. Turnover reached 57m shares,
continuing the recent spate of big turnover in the stock.
Smith New Court, Racal's broker, upped its expectation for this year to
Pounds 110m and for next year to Pounds 140m.
Regalian blow
Results from Regalian Properties were regarded as a horror story by the
market, with one analyst at a leading investment bank calling the figures
'breathtakingly bad'. He added that the subsequent meeting with management
was 'quite aggressive' and that although the company still has some worth,
it will have to raise as much cash as possible in the next 12 months to
placate its creditors. On Monday Regalian announced it had sold its 10 per
cent stake in Frogmore Estates at a loss of around Pounds 4m, in order to
raise Pounds 10.57m and reduce borrowings.
Shares in Regalian lost 7 to 15p after the company reported an annual loss
of Pounds 26.8m, against a profit of Pounds 11.12m, with the auditors
qualifying the accounts on the basis that further property provisions may be
needed. The company has already made an exceptional provision of Pounds
32.91m on property losses, which was much higher than most expectations.
Frogmore showed signs of recovery, after Regalian's 3.9m share placing on
Monday, rising 13 to 281p.
Asda active
Turnover in food group Asda was a hefty 10m shares, but the price was
unchanged at 33 1/2 p. Activity was boosted by encouraging news from
furniture retailer MFI, which will unveil plans today to re-launch the
company via a stock market flotation.
Asda retained 25 per cent of MFI when the company was acquired from the
combined group though a management buy-out in 1987. It is estimated that the
flotation will raise between Pounds 650m and Pounds 850m, but that Asda will
not be a long-term shareholder in MFI because of its need to reduce
borrowings.
Lasmo wanted
Lasmo outperformed the rest of an otherwise subdued oil sector, responding
to a series of positive news.
These included shareholder approval at Lasmo's EGM of the sale of Ultramar
assets, encouraging news from the group's drilling operations on Block
16/12a in the North Sea and news that Lasmo shares will be listed on the
Montreal and Toronto Stock Exchanges as from June 11.
The shares shares ended the session a net 3 firmer at 197p on turnover of
826,000. They were also helped by a positive note from Hoare Govett, the
company's stockbroker. Hoare, which increased its oil price estimate from
Dollars 18 to Dollars 20 a barrel earlier this week, said the market's
current rating for Lasmo is 'unduly pessimistic and does not take into
account its gearing to higher oil prices'. Hoare goes on to say that the
market ignores the upside potential that could be realised from the
rationalisation and integration of Ultramar's upstream assets.
Standard Chartered, 11 higher at 471p, and Royal Bank of Scotland, 3 1/2
firmer at 197 1/2 p were prominent in an otherwise quiet banking arena, the
former responding to hopes that no further provisons will need to be made
against its Indian operations and the latter to lingering takeover
speculation.
First National Finance shares plunged 11 to 64p, responding to publicity
given to a bearish note issued by BZW.
London &amp; Manchester's shift in accounting policy triggeredanother strong
rise by life stocks. Refuge were 23 higher at 728p; the Stock Exchange
announced late yesterday that a reported trade of 5.5m shares carried out at
705p, printed on the Seaq ticker on Tuesday, was incorrect and should have
read as 5,500 shares.
A flurry of switching out of BP and into British Gas left the former 1 1/2
off at 273p and the latter the same amount firmer at 252p. Turnover in BP
was showing signs of expanding sharply after Moody's, the US debt rating
agency confirmed, it had downgraded its rating of BP debt.
Shares in Dowty Group, moved swiftly forward after the aerospace and
information technology company finally succumbed to the hostile bid from
specialist engineering group TI.
The shares jumped 12 to close at 187p, the level of the paper offer from TI
as turnover rose to a hefty 6.4m after several investors took the view that
buying Dowty was the cheap way into TI.
It was announced after the market close that the aggressor had obtained a
total of 60.23 per cent acceptances, a closer finish to the contest than
many city analysts had predicted. Last week SG Warburg swept into the market
to pick up around 10 per cent of Dowty's shares.
The new group will be the second largest engineering concern in the market,
behind British Aerospace and is likely to become a FT-SE constituent in the
near future. TI edged a penny forward to 353p.
Sears was the worst performing Footsie stock, losing 5 1/2 to 86p, as 8.8m
shares changed hands. Suggestions that UBS Phillips and Drew had trimmed its
dividend and profits forecast hit the price, with stores analysts noting
increased doubts about the maintenance of the dividend since publication of
Sears results on May 7.
Northern Foods fulfilled the markets hopes, turning in slightly better than
expected profits of Pounds 126.2m, against Pounds 105.4m previously. Mr Tim
Potter at Smith New Court described it as a good, if well anticipated,
performance, with the proposal of a one-for-one scrip issue as an additional
sweetener.
The shares rose 14 to 605p on above average turnover of 1.7m shares.
In transports, a squeeze sent BAA forward to add 19 to 695p. Broker Williams
de Broe favours the stock and Mr Andy Darke at the broker said: 'The stock
is still cheap relative to the market. This is the core holding in the
transport sector.' Fears of tougher competition on the north Atlantic route
left British Airways 8 lighter at 269p.

FT  11 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Banks in focus in varied day
for bourses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A VARIED day for bourses, Paris seemed to find plenty to talk about while
Frankfurt remained quiet, writes Our Markets Staff. Elsewhere, there was a
focus on the financial sectors of four countries, partly after the
Copenhagen effect on bond markets last week, and partly ahead of results in
Sweden and Finland.
PARIS saw a continuation of some themes begun on Tuesday, as Schneider and
its related companies again came into the spotlight. At yesterday's annual
meeting the company reiterated what analysts had heard the day before by
forecasting a 1992 net profit of some FFr400m against a previous estimate of
FFr650m. The shares slid another FFr26.00 to FFr682.00, but off the day's
low of FFr662.00. Among its subsidiaries, Merlin weakened FFr16.00 to
FFr530.00 while theholding company, SPEP, shed FFr14.50 or 4.4 per cent to
FFr315.50.
The CAC-40 index had a slightly easier day, closing down 8.50 at 1,953.73,
having earlier touched 1,951.
News that Euro Disney had to close its gates on Sunday because the theme
park was full was one reason for a pick-up in its shares, which finished
FFr5.00 higher at FFr114.00. However, some analysts noted that the price had
fallen so much that it was ripe for an upturn.
News earlier in the day that Nestle was the buyer of Exor's remaining stake
in Suez left the latter down FFr3.20 at FFr315.20 while Exor was unchanged
at FFr1,401.00.
Nord Est improved FFr4.50 to FFr133.70 after the sale of a construction
group in which it was the majority shareholder to Lyonnaise des Eaux-Dumez.
Lyonnaise lost FFr11.00 to FFr537.00.
FRANKFURT's activity level improved from derisory to quiet, German stock
market turnover climbing from DM3.8bn to DM4.9bn as equities recovered from
a 1.77 decline to 711.83 in the FAZ index at midsession to a 3.50 gain to
1,789.76 in the DAX at the close.
Share price volatility stayed in the second liners with Deutsche Babcock,
weak recently on poor results and prospects, recovering DM6 to DM162.50 but
Lufthansa, in similar case, falling another DM3 to DM130.
Continental, the tyremaker, rose another DM2 to DM278 on speculation about
merger and/or profit prospects within the industry. Meanwhile, Escada, the
fashion company, fell another DM13.50 to a new 1992 low of DM332.50 on the
death last week of its co-founder, Ms Margaretha Ley. Its high for the year
was DM585.
In retailing, Karstadt rose DM7.50 to DM639 ahead of its 1991 results.
Banks came into the frame in Italy and Sweden, where they were selectively
higher, and in Switzerland and Finland where they were weak.
MILAN linked further gains in Credito Italiano and Mediobanca, L17 to L1,687
and L135 to L13,355 respectively, with those in other blue chips like Fiat,
Olivetti and Generali as the Comit index rose 1.03 to 481.07. Volume was
dulled again by technical problems.
In STOCKHOLM, banks staged a partial recovery after their recent losses, SE
Banken A gaining SKr1.50 to SKr31 and Handelsbanken A SKr0.50 to SKr50.50.
The Affarsvarlden General index fell 3.7 to 959.8.
ZURICH said that the financial sector was under more pressure than
industrials as the SMI index fell 11.1 to 1,888.5. Banks were under pressure
from interest rate worries, CS Holding bearers falling SFr40 to SFr1.860 and
insurers from an upcoming Zurich Insurance rights issue, although Winterthur
bearers led the way down with a fall of SFr60 to SFr3,190.
HELSINKI's banks led the fall as the Hex index dropped 15.1, or 1.9 per cent
to 783.7. The banks and finance index was down 3.8 per cent.
AMSTERDAM featured KLM and Fokker while the CBS Tendency index slipped 0.1
to 130.3. The airline group was 60 cents weaker at Fl 39.90 following the
cut in transatlantic air afares by the US airline, Delta. Fokker improved 90
cents to Fl 35.10 on news that the government may keep part of its stake
under terms being negotiated with DASA.
BRUSSELS followed other markets lower with retailers moving in heavy trade.
The Bel-20 index lost 4.1 to 1,219.78 with Delhaize losing BFr25 to BFr1,785
and GIB down BFr2 to BFr1,452. Solvay went against the trend, rising BFr75
to BFr13,575.
MADRID's general index improved 0.37 to 251.34 with turnover of some Pta11bn
in spite of Telefonica not being traded.

FT  11 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei lower after
active trading in theme stocks
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE unwinding depressed share prices yesterday, although sentiment was
also weak on the decline in the yen and Tuesday's fall on Wall Street,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 102.17 to 17,742.87, after a high of 17,972.20 and a
low of 17,576.07. Traders blamed late arbitrage-related selling by a leading
US broker.
Volume rose from 182m shares to 260m on active theme stock trading by
Japanese houses.
Advances led declines by 448 to 444 with 207 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks added rose 0.25 to 1,347.24 while, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index eased 1.38 to 1,058.62.
Pension funds and investment trusts were seen placing buying orders at lower
levels. Life insurance companies also said that they intended to pick up
blue chips if the index were to fall further.
Traders said that most foreign houses were expecting the index to fall
sharply on the futures expiration this Friday. However, leading Japanese
brokers have maintained a bullish stance. Daiwa Securities said that the
Nikkei should recover the 19,000 level due to a 'technical rebound'.
Bio-technology and chemical stocks led activity. Meiji Milk Products was the
most active issue of the day, gaining Y2 to Y994, and Nissan Chemical rose
Y29 to Y766.
Environmental-related theme stocks were also targeted by dealers, with Japan
Storage Battery advancing Y20 to Y1,080 and Penta-Ocean Construction up Y2
to Y962.
Weak earnings prospects pulled down Toyota Motor, which fell Y20 to Y1,490
on reports of an 8 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ending June
1993.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone fell Y11,000 to Y609,000. Investors failed to
react to the company's announcement of telephone charge discounts and free
prepaid telephone cards for its shareholders.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 13.64 to 20,483.91 in volume of 11.2m shares.
Roundup
WEAKNESS in the US affected some markets yesterday.
HONG KONG fell on profit-taking but HSBC bucked the trend following
Tuesday's decline to close 75 cents higher at HKDollars 45.50. The Hang Seng
index lost 22.69 to 5,917.50 in turnover of HKDollars 3.84bn.
SINGAPORE advanced on good gains in blue chip stocks. The Straits Times
Industrial index rose 19.30 to 1,511.41.
SEOUL was prevented from falling further after intervention by the
stabilisation fund. The composite index closed 1.11 higher at 562.87 in
turnover up from Won191.8bn to Won206.9bn .
TAIWAN moved upwards on financial stocks, helping the weighted index to
close up 107.15 at 4,633.80. Turnover climbed to TDollars 28.48bn from
TDollars 20.6bn.
MANILA rose on buying of oil stocks and the composite index advanced 5.09 to
1,573.34. KUALA LUMPUR was higher on bargain hunting with the composite
index up 4.85 to 589.52. Losers outpaced gainers by 119 to 105.
AUSTRALIA weakened with the banking sector dragging prices lower. The all
ordinaries closed 8.7 lower at 1,665.8.
BANGKOK bided its time ahead of the announcement of a new premier. The SET
index rose 2.91 to 687.38 in thin turnover of Bt2.91bn.
JAKARTA firmed on a peaceful poll and the return to power of President
Suharto's party, the Jardine Fleming index rising 1.40 to 69.62.

FT  11 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Bovespa rally after Telebras-led slump
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Sao Paulo stock market, which broke a string of five straight losing
days on Tuesday with a 2.45 per cent rise in the Bovespa index to 25,325,
was unchanged by midday yesterday, writes Bill Hinchberger.
Before Tuesday the index had registered a drop of 4.6 per cent for June. The
real loss was greater given an inflation index of 9.75 per cent for the same
period. That downturn has been primarily due to a fall in Telebras, the
state-controlled telecommunications holding company. Telebras closed up 1.6
per cent on Tuesday, at Dollars 24.12, after a 6.4 per cent drop on Monday.
It was 2.3 per cent lower by midday yesterday. Generally responsible for
over one-half of trade, Telebras weighs heavily on the index.
Some analysts attributed the Telebras downturn to domestic investors,
primarily concerned with their positions in the local options market. Others
believe that foreign investors are slowing their rate of investment in
Telebras, and Brazil, after the government's decision last week to cancel
the company's planned ADR placing in New York.
The official explanation is that a large ADR issue might erode the Telebras
share price, with a negative affect on privatisation plans. Some say that
this step has created doubt in the minds of investors over the government's
commitment to privatise the company. Mr Alvaro Augusto Vidigal Filho,
Bovespa president, has called on officials to calm the market with a clear
statement of its plans for Telebras.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark loses recent gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK lost more of its recent gains against European currencies
yesterday, as the foreign exchange market's fears about European Monetary
Union (Emu) temporarily faded away, writes James Blitz.
Sterling, the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo regained some of the
ground that they had lost to the German currency in the wake of Denmark's
rejection of Emu one week ago. Both the Italian lira and the French franc
also recovered ground, but by not quite as much as the other high-yielding
currencies.
It is unlikely that any of these recoveries marked a significant shift away
from the market's perception that Emu is in serious trouble. Instead,
analysts are putting yesterday's D-Mark's losses down to profit-taking.
'Nothing has changed as far as the Maastricht worries are concerned,' said
Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai Banking Corp, in
London. 'It is only short term position taking that has caused the D-Mark to
suffer.'
Sterling made the best gains of the day, rising  1/2 a pfennig to close at
DM2.9200. It also ended a little more relaxed in the European Monetary
System grid, finishing the day third from bottom. Worries over the Spanish
peseta also faded a little as the currency ended the day at Pta62.91 to the
D-Mark from a previous close of Pta62.98. The Italian lira was a little
stronger at Lira755.8 to the D-Mark from a previous close of 756.4. But it
was still at the bottom of the EMS grid and its long term prospects continue
to worry the market now that Emu is in such big difficulties.
The dollar appreciated slightly against the German currency at the start of
European trading, and reached a high of around DM1.6005. But it slid down in
the afternoon on the back of soft US housing completion figures. These
dropped 8.5 per cent in April to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of
1.026m.
The market will probably wait for the arrival of today's figures for May
producer prices and retail sales before deciding whether to invest further
in the US currency. The current forecast is for a rise of 0.3 per cent in
the producer prices and a 0.7 per cent rise in May sales after a 0.9 per
cent gain in April. Last night, the dollar closed in Europe at DM1.5930 from
a previous close of DM1.5900. In late American trading, it was up to
DM1.5940.
The Japanese yen was weaker against the D-Mark as the market took a gloomy
view of the possible contents of tomorrow's Tankan quarterly business
survey, issued by the Bank of Japan. Dealers fear that the survey might be
weak enough to persuade the BoJ to weaken policy. The D-Mark ended the day
at Y80.03 from a previous close of Y80.27.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES in the sterling interbank market were slightly firmer yesterday as the
market took most of the day to remove a Pounds 750m shortage forecast by the
Bank of England.
After several days in which money had been relatively cheap, the short dates
in the cash market moved up yesterday. The overnight rate moved between much
narrower ranges of 9 3/4 and 10 1/4 per cent, having hit a low of 8 1/2 per
cent the previous day. 1-month money moved up to 9 15/16 per cent from a
previous close of 9 7/8 per cent. However, everything from 2-months out
ended the day at the same rate of 10 per cent.
Traders said that the firming of shorter-dated rates was due purely to
supply and demand factors in the market. After forecasting a Pounds 750m
shortage, the Bank purchased Pounds 11m of bills for resale to the market on
29 June at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank then purchased
Pounds 387m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 143m of Band-2
bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 25m for resale to the market on 29
June at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent. The Bank did not operate in
the market in the afternoon, but issued late assistance of around Pounds
35m.
Despite these technical factors, the longer-dated rates reflected a bearish
view on a possible rate cut. They were unchanged, despite sterling's  1/2
pfennig rise against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday. Traders
said that the bearish view still dominates in the cash market on a possible
base rate cut.
That was the prevailing view among traders in sterling futures. September
short sterling ended up one tick on the day at 90.23. This assumes that
3-month sterling libor in September will be at 9.77 per cent, less than  1/4
per cent lower from yesterday's rate.
December short sterling was also only a tick higher at 90.47, implying that
3-month sterling libor at the end of the year will be at 9.53 per cent. In
other words, the market is assuming that another  1/2 percent cut in rates
this year is unlikely.
German call money rates were quoted unchanged at 9.60-9.65 per cent
yesterday after the Bundesbank held rates steady in its weekly tender for
securities repurchase funds. The Bundesbank allocated DM38.3bn in a 28-day
tender, mostly at 9.65 per cent.

<TEXT>
NORWAY has sold more than 90 per cent of its frozen salmon mountain of
37,500 tonnes on the world market for about Pounds 100m. This is well above
original estimates, according to Aquastar, a wholly-owned subsidiary of BP
Nutrition.
By the beginning of this month only about 4,000 tonnes of Norway's salmon
stock remained to be sold.
Aquastar was appointed last November by a consortium of Norwegian banks and
the Norwegian government to sell the stock of frozen salmon left by FOS, the
Norwegian fish farmers organisation, when it went bankrupt. This amounted to
20 per cent of annual Norwegian salmon production.
'We have managed to sell Norway's salmon in a controlled way,' said Mr Ingo
Skulason, Aquastar's managing director, yesterday.
He added: 'We have stabilised the world salmon market but maximised the
price of it. The company has followed a tough trading policy with stringent
(price) monitoring of the salmon where it has been sold'.
The salmon has been sold to more than 30 countries, mainly in eastern Europe
and the Far East. It was not sold in the US and the European Community in
order to avoid allegations of dumping.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: SA union wants state to help
shrink mines industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA'S National Union of Mineworkers has proposed state aid in
restructuring the gold mining industry, to assist an orderly scaling down
and to protect jobs.
Although the union's initiative is at industry level, it arises from the
particular circumstances of the Harmony gold mine, by far the largest of the
country's marginal gold mines, where 6,000 workers were recently laid off.
The initiative comes against the background of some 130,000 lost jobs in the
industry since 1989, with about 30,000 workers retrenched or dismissed in
the past year.
The NUM, which presented its proposals to Mr George Bartlett, minister of
mineral and energy affairs, earlier this week, contends that state policy on
not aiding marginal mines is seriously flawed.
It argues that the 1990 Marais Committee report into the subject is
outdated, because it seriously underestimated the speed and extent to which
mines would be forced to scale down operations. The government will respond
within the next two weeks.
The NUM, though accepting that all mines must eventually close, believes the
state should assist the industry restructuring process.
It suggests this should take the form of a carefully structured aid
programme for marginal mines, to slow down the rate of contraction of the
industry and thus benefit workers, suppliers and the regional economy.
The union proposes the state should seek to maintain employment levels, that
underground production should be increased to lengthen mines' lives, and
that miners should be retrained in other skills. Further, alternative uses
of mining assets should be encouraged, and rural areas should get planned
assistance, in view of the serious effects of job losses in mines.
The NUM argues that short-term relief can be offered to a mine without any
net cost to the national exchequer. Although a mine operating at a loss does
not pay tax, its operations benefit the exchequer in five ways: employees'
income taxes; direct taxes such as VAT; Regional Service Council levies on
wages; mining lease taxes and taxes paid by mine suppliers and their
employees.
The NUM's calculations for 1990 indicate that the tax generated by a mine
making no profit was worth R4,912 (Pounds 951.90) per kilogram of gold
produced, and thus a state subsidy of this amount would be justified. In the
first quarter of 1992, about 12 per cent of gold was produced at a loss.
Analysts reckon that five mines are in immediate jeopardy - Doornfontein,
Libanon, Loraine, SA Land and West Rand Consolidated, with another five not
far behind. Production coming on stream at some of the richer mines will
largely offset any closures.
Mr Dave Giese, analyst at stockbrokers Davis, Borkum Hare, estimates that
closures over the next two years could cause gold production to fall by 5
per cent, to about 570 tonnes a year by 1994.

THE LONDON Futures and Options exchange has hired independent commodities
consultant Landell Mills Commodities Studies to look at ways of developing
the London sugar market, Reuter reports.
Mr Phillip Thorpe, the exchange's chief executive, said: 'London FOX has
commenced a study to assess how the sugar market can develop and expand in
the medium to long-term and how it should best respond to changing market
conditions.'
Declining raw sugar volumes over the past 18 months have been of concern to
traders for some time.
In an attempt to revive interest, the market switched from floor- to
screen-trading, only to revert to the floor one year later, this January.
In the first four months of this year, raw sugar traded only 50,110 lots,
compared with 136,313 lots in January to April 1991 and 426,463 lots in the
corresponding period of 1990.

marketing system

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE IVORY Coast, the world's biggest cocoa exporter, is to present its aid
donors this week with a proposal for a cocoa crop marketing system, said Mr
Michel Manceau, managing director of EC-sponsored association Aproma, Reuter
reports from Paris.
Mr Manceau was talking after a visit to see how the country was implementing
a reform of its cocoa marketing prompted by aid donors.
'The liberalisation of its domestic network worked well,' he said. 'What has
to be done now is to define how it will put forward its anticipated sales
and ensure a permanent presence on the market. The amounts will not be
discussed, only the method.'
The country's donors consider that the Ivory Coast's withdrawal from the
world market, as well as its return, have had a negative impact on world
cocoa prices, he said.
'Cocoa prices tumbled this year, even though the Caistab (Caisse de
Stabilisation, the Ivorian commodities board) has stepped out of the world
market,' Mr Manceau said.
European traders earlier said the delayed start to Ivory Coast's new crop
sales campaign was increasingly weighing on cocoa prices, which are at 16
1/2 -year lows.
'The important thing is that the Ivory Coast set up a control system of its
own sales, define its anticipated sales, and its method for a permanent
presence on the market,' Mr Manceau said.

exploration blocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIETNAM has opened up four more oil blocks off its southern coast to
exploration by foreign companies, PetroVietnam, the state oil company, said
yesterday.
Mitsubishi of Japan, the Astra Group of Indonesia and British Gas are the
latest companies to reach provisional accords in a region which is
attracting increasing interest from foreign oil producers, as they seek to
replace their reserves. Bidding for the final block was still going on,
PetroVietnam said.
Lasmo, the independent UK oil producer, announced last week that it had won
a joint tender with C. Itoh, the Japanese trading company, in the same area.
That was followed this week by an announcement from British Petroleum and
Statoil, the Norwegian state-owned oil company, that they had formally
confirmed a production-sharing contract with PetroVietnam for a concession
offered in the first licensing round.
Vietnam has now allocated nine of the 10 blocks south-east of the southern
coastal town of Vung Tau to foreign bidders. The blocks were originally to
be explored by Vietsovpetro, a joint venture with the Soviet Union, but were
handed back to Vietnamese control a year ago, after Hanoi complained that
Moscow lacked the technology to develop them.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ex-Soviet Union's aluminium
exports soar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTS OF aluminium from the former Soviet Union to the West soared to 1m
tonnes last year, the European Aluminium Association estimates,
This compares with exports during the 1980s of between 250,000 and 300,000
tonnes a year. The huge increase in supply - and not weak demand - was the
main reason for the European industry's problems over the past 18 months, Mr
Dag Flaa, president of the EAA, said yesterday.
He said: 'It is obvious that such a dramatic and sudden change in the metal
flow to the West was bound to give digestion problems in the industry.
'Without this disturbing influence, the market balance for aluminium would
have been fairly satisfactory.'
The increase in imports has led to cuts in European production. Last year
output fell 3.5 per cent to 3.48m tonnes. This year the EAA estimates
European output will fall further to 3.28m tonnes, following cuts in both
production and capacity.
Total world output in 1991 was up 3.5 per cent to 14.81m tonnes. The rise
followed new smelter capacity in Canada, Latin America and Asia. An
additional 640,000 tonnes of capacity is expected to come on stream this
year.
European consumption continued to increase in 1991 but by only 1.7 per cent,
to 4.7m tonnes. The EAA last year forecast an increase of 4.5 per cent,
expecting much greater offtake in eastern Germany, which did not
materialise. It now expects a further 2.5 per cent rise this year,
reflecting increased demand from both the packaging and construction
sectors.
While the EAA remains optimistic on world consumption prospects, forecasting
an annual growth rate of about 3 per cent, it remains concerned about the
low level of world prices.
Dr Hans Georg Seebauer, secretary general of the EAA, pointed out that 'LME
quotations of less than Dollars 1,350 a tonne are certainly not sufficient
to cover the costs of most Western World producers'.
Mr Flaa believes there are grounds for optimism as the supply-demand balance
becomes more healthy. But he admits that, while the association hopes to see
a reduction in exports from the former Soviet Union, 'we have to assume that
the level will still be high by historical standards'.
He believes, however, that the underlying market balance is fundamentally
different from the early 1980s, when only 80 per cent of the Western
aluminium industry was working. Today the rate is 96 per cent.
Stocks of aluminium at Western smelters totalled 3.278m tonnes at the end of
April, compared with 3.291m in March and 3.363m in April 1991, provisional
International Primary Aluminium Institute figures show.

COCOA prices dropped to fresh 16 1/2 -month lows at the London Futures and
Options Exchange yesterday in a continuation of Tuesday's sharp decline.
Dealers could find no fundamental reason for the fall, which left the
September delivery position Pounds 10 down at Pounds 539 a tonne, Pounds 4
above the day's low. Likewise in the COFFEE market lack of supportive news
rather than any notable deterioration in fundamentals was blamed for another
sharp fall. The September robustas price closed at Dollars 723 a tonne, down
Dollars 11 on the day. 'People just get tired and they sell it down to a
level where other people are comfortable to hold on to a few longs for a
couple of days,' one trader said. At the London Metal Exchange the recent
declines in NICKEL and ALUMINIUM prices were arrested and other contracts
closed with modest gains. An upturn in COPPER values quickly ran into
resistance at the same dollar level that marked the end of the previous
bounce in the middle of last week. The cash price closed at Pounds 1,233.50
a tonne, up Pounds 4.50. Market talk of Chinese selling at the higher levels
could not be confirmed although it was sufficient to make buyers cautious.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Exports dent Russia's official
gold reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA HAS exported 30 tonnes of gold so far this year and its official
reserves now stand at a total of 210 tonnes, the chief of the republic's
co-ordinating body for precious stones and metals said yesterday.
Mr Yevgeny Bychkov said that 75 tonnes of the gold reserves were with the
Russian central bank, while the remaining 135 tonnes are being held by his
Committee for Precious Stones and Metals.
The latest reserve figure, dating from June 1, is lower than the 240 tonnes
figure (of January 1) given as the reserves of the whole Soviet Union before
the country collapsed in December 1991.
The decline in reserves has occurred because very little gold has been
extracted since the Soviet reserves were transferred to Russia (the Russian
gold mining season begins in May and ends in November) and 'we have had
expenses to cover in the mean time', Mr Bychkov explained.
He said figures for annual gold production remained confidential. But he
dismissed a forecast he attributed to Mr Valery Rudakov, head of the state
Rosalmazzoloto gold and diamond mining conglomerate, that production was
expected to fall by 30 per cent this year.
He also said that the gold needs of domestic industry (jewellery and
electronics) would total about 90 tonnes for this year.
The government had also committed itself to exporting at least 25 per cent
of gold production, so that it could pay producers some hard currency.
According to one western estimate, total gold production of the former
Soviet Union last year was 220 tonnes, and could fall to 200 tonnes in the
next three years.
Mr Bychkov admitted that a key priority was to attract investment into the
flagging gold industry, but suggested it was unlikely that an Australian
consortium called Star Technology Systems would be allowed to conclude a
deal making it the first foreign company to buy into a Russian gold mining
enterprise.
He said he had already held preliminary talks with international mining
companies, including RTZ and Newmont, on ways in which they could do
business in Russia.
He said the Sukhoi Log mine, Russia's largest proven hard rock gold deposit
and part of the state-owned Russian company Star wants to be buy into, would
most likely be put out to tender - a process that would take a long time.
Lenzoloto, the Russian enterprise in question, has said it needs money fast,
to keep up work already begun on this and other parts of its operations. Mr
Bychkov said the Russian state would give it Dollars 16m  - proceeds from
other gold sales - to keep going. 'It is a form of government help,' he
said.
Although copper is not part of his responsibilities, Mr Bychkov revealed
that Russia also planned soon to put out to international tender the
development of one of its biggest copper mines - at the Udokan site in
Siberia.
He said that the government also hoped that freeing the domestic price of
gold to a world level of Dollars 11 a gramme (Rbs85 according to the
official market exchange rate) would stimulate output.
That was the price the state would pay producers for their gold. But
unresolved difficulties remained.
One was how to support the self-employed brigades that undertook seasonal
mining but remained dependent on big state-owned enterprises for equipment.
Another was how to restructure the enterprises themselves.
Mr Bychkov, who was appointed to the head of the committee formed by
President Boris Yeltsin in November after he was cleared of wrong-doing in a
scandal over illicit diamond sales, said he remained dissatisfied with
Russia's partnership with De Beers' Central Selling Organisation.
A deal concluded between the CSO and the Soviet Union in July 1990 gave
Moscow a Dollars 1bn loan against future diamond deliveries.
The five-year agreement also gave De Beers the exclusive right to sell
Russian uncut (rough) diamonds on international markets.
Mr Bychkov said Russia had no alternative but to abide by the deal, but
suggested that it inhibited Russia from polishing more of its own stones.
He said Russia had both the know-how and the equipment to engage in the more
profitable activity of cutting its own diamonds, rather than exporting rough
stones. But even though nothing in the De Beers deal banned Russia from
trading in polished diamonds, it still lacked the marketing skills to do so
on any significant scale.

<TEXT>
A BRAZILIAN high court suspended on Tuesday a restraining order that was
preventing the Ebesa mining group from initiating tin exploration at Bom
Futuro, an open-cast site in the Amazon state of Rondonia.
Ebesa is a seven-company joint venture headed by Paranapanema, the world's
largest tin exporter and Brazil's largest private mining company. Ebesa
holds the mining rights to Bom Futuro.
The court order had been issued in response to a suit filed by wildcat
miners operating at the site.
Under the terms of Tuesday's decision, these miners will be forced to
abandon their operations.
Mr Samuel A. Hanan, director-vice president of Paranapanema, said the
company will demand that clandestine firms leave the area. He said
individual wildcatters might be hired to work for Ebesa at the site. Some
500-600 employees would be needed when the mine was fully operational.
Mr Hanan said that Ebesa would have a small plant in place within 10 days,
but he could not predict when the mine would be in full production. Output
should not exceed the 8,000-10,000 tonnes a year now extracted by wildcat
miners. Those independent miners extracted 81,500 tonnes between 1987, when
operations began, and last year.

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Row erupts over Italian bond
trade settlement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW over the settlement of Italian government bonds traded during
turbulent market conditions last week has broken out between several
London-based firms and a number of Italian banks.
A US investment bank, a Swiss bank and a broking firm are among the
London-based firms to have experienced disputed trades with Italian banks.
The trades, entered last week when the market fell sharply after the Danish
referendum rejecting the Maastricht Treaty, should have been settled this
week. But some Italian banks have claimed trades are void because settlement
had not occurred within three days, the standard settlement period in the
domestic market.
In the international market, when bonds are cleared through Cedel or
Euroclear, seven days is the standard settlement period.
Failure to settle within the standard time is usually penalised by the
charging of interest, according to one of the London-based banks.
Consequently, they are challenging the Italian banks' position that, under
Italian legislation introduced at the start of this year, the trades can be
considered void, or a surcharge levied.
The issue raises a number of legal questions on the jurisdiction of domestic
and international domains which have yet to be clarified.
The international bond markets are regulated by the International Securities
Market Association, which is a regulatory body in the UK.
'If there is a transaction between two ISMA members in an ISMA product, then
ISMA regulations, including seven-day settlement, should apply,' said an
ISMA official.
Many banks face substantial losses in the Italian government bond market,
which is down three points since the Danish referendum result. The bid/offer
spreads quoted by traders have widened, and some liquidity has disappeared,
as banks try to minimise losses.
Widespread selling by international investors, who had been enthusiastic
buyers of the paper, left some Italian banks with the impression that they
were expected to mop up pools of paper despite a lack of enthusiasm from
domestic investors.

MOODY'S Investor Service, the US credit ratings agency, lowered the ratings
of four Japanese trust banks due to their vulnerability to the volatile
stock market and deterioration in earnings quality.
Moody's lowered long-term debt ratings of Mitsubishi Trust and Banking and
Sumitomo Trust and Banking to A2, and Yasuda Trust and Banking and Toyo
Trust and Banking to A3.
Moody's said that the trust banks were affected by financial liberalisation
in Japan, and faced lower profitability due to the sharp falls in stock and
real estate prices.
The trust banks have substantial bad loans to real estate companies and
non-bank financial institutions. Trust banks are also hurt by the decline in
fee based income from discretionary investment management and real estate
broking.
Japan's Deposit Insurance Corp (DIC) will give Sanwa Bank Y20bn (Dollars
156m) to assist its merger with Toyo Shinkin Bank, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
DIC said the money would be given as a grant, which does not need to be
repaid.

MORE Canadian life insurance companies are understood to be planning links
with trust companies to strengthen their defences against growing
competition.
Last week, North American Life Insurance, with assets of CDollars 7bn
(USDollars 5.8bn) and CDollars 64bn insurance in force, paid CDollars 51m to
take over First City Trust, part of the ailing financial services empire of
the Belzberg family.
North American Life is headed by a former banker, Mr William Bradford. Two
government deposit insurance agencies put up CDollars 175m in loans to
restore the trust company's capital position.
Mr Bradford called the deal an excellent strategic fit. First City has 31
retail trust branches across Canada and a deposit base of CDollars 3bn.
The deal is fully in step with Canada's new financial services legislation
now coming into force and which is aimed at making a more competitive
industry. Banks, insurance companies, investment dealers and trust companies
can invade each other's territory, subject to federal super-vision.
In recent months, insurance companies have taken over 20 trusts.
Manufacturers Life, Sun Life and Laurentian Life have bought trusts and
North American Life is buying First City Trust. The trend is towards towards
more concentration in financial services.
The acquisitions allow the insurance companies to move into consumer lending
and deposit-taking, as well as developing the traditional fiduciary
services.
However, trusts have been poor profit-makers in the long recession and some
are losing money. Some big life companies are refusing to join the rush.
Great-West Life, for example, does half its business in the US and is
actively expanding there.

KREDIETBANK, which usually presents itself as the most regional of the three

Announcing the opening of new branch offices in Manchester, Dublin,
Maastricht, Berlin, Paris and Moscow, Mr Marcel Cockaerts, chairman, said:
'We want to grow in concentric circles (around Belgium).'
Mr Cockaerts told the bank's annual press conference that a 'strong home

The bank wants to build a network of subsidiaries in neighbouring countries
and a presence in other countries if warranted.
The new policy is already reflected in the balance sheet: at the end of
March, 47.1 per cent of non-consolidated assets were foreign, up from 43 per
cent a year ago and 38 per cent in 1987.
'In volume, foreign transactions are now as important as domestic ones,' Mr
Cockaerts said.
He said domestic retail banking still accounted for two-thirds of the bank's
net profit, with the other one-third coming from banking abroad and
professional business.
However, slower earnings growth from domestic banking would hit
Kredietbank's 1992 profit growth, he said.
'The pressure on our Belgian francs interest rate margin has increased,' Mr
Cockaerts said. He said that, unlike last year, Kredietbank would not be
able to fully compensate the rising cost of client deposits with a higher
margin on lending rates.
He said net profits in 1992 would increase, but not by as much as the 21 per
cent jump to BFr7.4bn (Dollars 226m) in 1991-92.
The banks plans to change its financial year-end to December. This year's
accounting period will this run for nine months.

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Premier Group turns in improved
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE restructured Premier Group, the South African foods, pharmaceuticals and
leisure company, improved earnings in the 13 months to the end of April.
Results have been restated in an annualised form to make them comparable
with 1991. Turnover rose by 93 per cent to R9.8bn while trading profit was
12 per cent higher at R420.1m (Dollars 149.4m). Attributable earnings
advanced 24 per cent to R190m.
The jump in turnover and the lower margins reflect the acquisition of
controlling interests in Metro, Cash and Carry, Score supermarkets and Click
stores, the first three chains being high turnover, low margin businesses.
On an annualised basis, turnover of comparable operations rose by 13 per
cent.
Other transactions included the sale of 50 per cent of Bonny Bird Farms and
50 per cent of Epol Animal Feeds. The results of CNA Gallo are no longer
being consolidated.
Mr Peter Wrighton, chairman, said a highlight of the year's performance had
been the substantial improvement in the group's gearing, with interest
bearing debt down to R160.5m from R347.6m. The debt:equity ratio has
improved to 10.6 per cent from 24.6 per cent. He said the low gearing, and
the R80m cash in hand put the company in a good position to expand further.
Mr Wrighton also stressed the turnround in the performance of Metro and
Score and the more than 50 per cent improvement in earnings at Twins
Pharmaceuticals following a rationalisation programme and the elimination of
borrowings.
Mr Wrighton also addressed the issue of food inflation which caused a public
outcry when the Central Statistical Service said recently that it was
running at 28.9 per cent per annum.
He pointed out that 70 per cent of this inflation originated from meat,
vegetables and fruit and nuts - areas in which Premier is not involved. He
also dismissed as 'nonsense' claims that the country's severe drought might
cause food prices to soar by as much as 45 per cent.
Earnings per share were 16 per cent up at 244 cents, and the dividend was
lifted to 88 cents from 70 cents per share. Mr Wrighton forecast
satisfactory growth for the year ahead.
Divisional contributions to turnover and attributable profits were,
respectively: Cash and Carry - 40 per cent and 9.2 per cent; Food - 28.5 per
cent and 59.9 per cent; Retail - 16.5 per cent and 7.5 per cent;
Pharmaceuticals - 11 per cent and 15.5 per cent and Entertainment and
Leisure - 4 per cent and 7.8 per cent.

JAPANESE companies' profits for the business year ending March 31 1993 are
likely to drop 7 per cent from year-earlier levels, the Yamaichi Research
Institute of Securities and Economics said in a report, Reuter reports from
Tokyo.
The Yamaichi report covered 673 companies from all industries.
Despite lower interest rates and accelerated public works projects, company
profits will be hampered by heavy inventory burdens in the first half of
1992-1993. A recovery is unlikely until the second half, the report said.
But the surveyed companies' current profits should rebound the following
year, rising 11.6 per cent from year-ago levels, the report said.

<TEXT>
UNITED Grain Growers, of Winnipeg, Canada's first farmer-owned grain
handling and marketing company, plans to go public with an initial offer of
around CDollars 40m (USDollars 33m).
UGG, founded in 1906, operates 265 grain elevators and terminals in western
Canada. The company, whose crop forecasts are known worldwide, employs
1,500.
Revenues in 1990-1991 were CDollars 1.1bn, with profits of CDollars 2.7m.
Most of the revenues come from fees farmers pay for grain storage and
transfer to rail wagons.
Mr Brian Hayward, chief executive, said the offer would go ahead next spring
after approval of the 70,000 UGG farmer-owners who will retain control.
The new money will be used to modernise UGG facilities. The competing
Saskatchewan Wheat Pool is also considering going public.
BCG, Canada's biggest telecommunications group, has dropped plans to raise
its 25 per cent interest in SHL Systemhouse, the fast-growing systems
integrator, to 60 per cent.
BCE says it will keep its options open, but the plan to create a strategic
alliance between itself, Bell Canada, its fully-owned telecommunications
utility, and SHL 'has been terminated'.
It would not immediately comment further.
BCE had planned to buy SHL treasury stock to bring its holding to 60 per
cent at CDollars 12.75 a share or CDollars 287m in all. Bell Canada's data
processing would have been transferred to SHL.
Since talks began last February, SHL stock has moved up to CDollars 16 in
the market as the company made acqusitions and made new contracts in North
America and Europe.
Canadian Bond Rating Service has again reduced its rating on Bramalea's debt
securities. The property developer, controlled indirectly by the Mr Peter
and Mr Edward Bronfman interests, is struggling with heavy debt and has
promised its bankers a new business plan.
CBRS reduced its Bramalea rating to non-investment grade six weeks ago.
Yesterday, it downgraded the rating another notch because of 'concern about
Bramalea's ability to restructure its balance sheet'.

FT  11 JUN 92 / International Company News: Simplicity becomes virtue at
Worms - The French holding company's restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE history of Worms et Cie, one of France's oldest holding companies,
stretches back for more than a century. However, when Mr Nicholas Clive
Worms, the present chairman, addresses his shareholders in Paris today, he
will be talking about a completely new company.
A year ago Mr Clive Worms outlined Worms' new structure to his shareholders.
At today's meeting, he will be reporting on the company's progress in its
first year under its new guise.
Worms et Cie is one of the quintessentially French breed of holding
companies, with an assortment of interests in different sectors often in the
form of minority shareholdings that may carry controlling status.
It began life as a trading company in 1848 and swiftly diversified into
shipping. Worms et Cie retains the relics of the old shipping business, but
it is also involved in insurance, luxury goods, property, banking, sugar and
paper. It controls some companies, such as Athena, its insurance business,
and the Financiere Truffaut luxury goods vehicle. But it does not control
others, such as the Saint-Louis sugar and paper group. Until last year's
restructuring, its interests were even more diverse and split between two
companies, Pechelbronn and Simer.
Such company structures are common in France, where the corporate sector is
riddled with cross-shareholdings. Suez, the diversified industrial and
financial group, is another example, as is Compagnie de Navigation Mixte.
However, they tend to be incomprehensible to the international investors
which are a prime source of capital for French companies. It was this
concern that prompted Mr Clive Worms to restructure the group last year.
He made his decision against the backdrop of a disagreement with Assurances
Generales de France (AGF), one of the large French insurers and a long-term
investor which had wanted to increase its holding. AGF eventually agreed to
sell part of its stake back to the company, thereby reducing its holding to
8.2 per cent. Mr Clive Worms wanted to bring in other minority investors,
such as IFIL - the company controlled by the Agnelli family of Italy, that
two years ago bought a 7.4 per cent stake - to buy the old AGF shares.
'In France things tend to be very incestuous, with the same names cropping
up again and again as investors,' he said. 'We thought it would be more
exciting to go further afield. We needed a simpler structure to become more
accessible to international investors and also because, after our expansion
in the 1980s, we were a much bigger group.'
Pechelbronn and Simer were merged into one company, Worms et Cie, and the
group shed a string of its minority stakes. Truffaut, for instance, has
rationalised its portfolio by selling its stakes in some companies, such as
the Jean-Louis Scherrer fashion house, and reducing its holdings in others,
notably Christian Dior. Other holdings, including Suez itself, are engaged
in the same process. But they are doing so on a piecemeal basis, whereas
Worms has acted quickly.
Mr Clive Worms is convinced that he has achieved his goal of making Worms,
which recently announced net profits of FFr1bn (Dollars 186.9m) for 1991,
simpler and more efficient. Earlier this year he sold the rest of the AGF
shares to the Abu Dhabi Investment Authority, which now owns 5.5 per cent,
and to Temasek of Singapore with 4.5 per cent.
The jury is still out on whether Worms has succeeded in making itself more
comprehensible internationally. One Paris analyst applauded it for the speed
with which it had rationalised its interests. Another said that 'despite all
the changes' it was 'still a mystery' outside France.
So far, Worms' share price has sided with the sceptics. It closed yesterday
at FFr341, well below FFr400 where it hovered immediately after its change
of name.

MODO, Sweden's third-largest pulp and paper company, has posted a SKr335m
(Dollars 58.3m) loss for the first four months of the year, writes Robert
Taylor. This compares with a SKr433m profit in the 1991 period.
MoDo said yesterday that it feared that it would incur heavier losses over
the rest of the year. The deterioration in MoDo's position began in the
second four-month period of last year, when it reported a SKr102m loss.
Mr Bernt Lof, president, said that rationalisation measures had lowered
costs and that the company hoped to have saved SKr500m by 1994 as a result.
'My judgment is that the forestry industry has reached the absolute bottom
of the business cycle,' he added.

<TEXT>
KVAERNER, Norway's largest privately-owned industrial company with interests
in engineering, shipbuilding and shipping, yesterday reported an improvement
in its profits before financial items to NKr424m (Dollars 68.3m) in the
first four months of the year from SKr401m for the same period of 1991.
The order book rose by 11 per cent to NKr6.535bn from NKr5.906bn.
Kvaerner's shipping business suffered a sharp fall in profitability to
NKr39m from NKr164m for the first four months of last year. It made a small
loss of NKr12m in its manufacturing division compared with a NKr14m profit
in the year-earlier period.
However, this was more than compensated for by the rise in profits from
shipbuilding to NKr252m, nearly double the NKr137m made in the same months
last year.
The company also reported a hefty increase in profits from offshore
activities, from NKr40m to NKr87m. In its wood-processing division, profits
rose to NKr69m from NKr50m.
The company also announced that it was launching a seven-for-one equity
issue, creating 5.33m shares. A further 300,000 new shares will be issued to
employees.
Kvaerner's financial position was strengthened recently by its acquisition
of Masa, the Finish shipbuilding group, and Gotaverken Energy, the Swedish
environmental company.
Aker, one of Norway's largest industrial groups, made a profit after
financial items of NKr263m for the first four months of the year, a
substantial improvement on the NKr23m loss a year ago.
Turnover rose to NKr5.4bn for the first four months, compared with NKr3.8bn.
The company said that the market for cement and construction materials
continued to be weak even though the economic downturn in Norway seemed to
have bottomed out.
Aker estimated that this year it would make a loss in those activities
comparable with the NKr79m deficit in 1991. The main hope of revival lies in
the oil and gas technology side of the business, where orders have been
encouraging.

plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE of the five main board directors of Landesbank Schleswig-Holstein
resigned yesterday in protest at plans for the sale of a stake in the
publicly-owned institution to Westdeutsche Landesbank (WestLB).
Despite denials from Mr Bjorn Engholm, head of the Kiel-based bank's
administrative council, Mr Gerd Lausen, chairman, suggested a deal had
already been struck, even though negotiations are not due to start until
July.
Mr Engholm, who is also leader of the federal Social Democrat (SPD)
opposition party, and prime minister of Schleswig-Holstein, is a close
associate of Mr Johannes Rau, SPD, prime minister of North-Rhine Westphalia,
the state which owns WestLB.
The boardroom walk-out marks another extraordinary turn in the evolution of
the regional public banking industry in Germany, and highlights the mounting
resentment against the aggressive WestLB and its chairman, Mr Friedel
Neuber.
WestLB, heading for operating profits of DM1bn (Dollars 632m) this year, is
the biggest of the regional banks and the third-largest bank in the country.
Since the Hesse state bank, Helaba, rejected its approaches in 1988, WestLB
has linked up with SudwestLB in Stuttgart, set up DIHB specialising in
industrial banking services in east Germany, and expanded its WestLB Europa
subsidiary into 13 European countries.
Mr Neuber, who is regularly accused of over-stepping the boundaries of what
is correct for a state bank, has also built up a substantial presence in
industry by buying minority stakes in local companies such as Preussag, the
steel and engineering group.
The traditional role of the state banks is to act as umbrella organisations
for regional government-run savings banks and as financing conduits for
local authorities in their home states.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Acquisitive year for Northern Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHERN FOODS' balance sheet has borne the costs of its acquisition
programme, which totalled Pounds 398m in the year to end-March, up from
Pounds 69m the year before.
Net borrowings at the year end were Pounds 199m (Pounds 53.4m).
Shareholders' funds fell from Pounds 305.4m to Pounds 277m, leaving gearing
at 72 per cent (18 per cent).
There was a goodwill write-off of Pounds 282m, a Pounds 6m fair value
adjustment and a Pounds 36m provision to cover rationalisation costs at
Express Dairies and Eden Vale. Part of the acquisition was funded by a
rights issue which raised Pounds 227m after expenses.
Mr Martin Clark, finance director, said that the group's cash flow was
strong. He said internally generated funds covered a record level of capital
spending of Pounds 93m (Pounds 61m) with Pounds 30m to spare.
In the current year, he said, capital expenditure would rise to Pounds 120m,
but would fall the year after that. As a result the depreciation charge of
about Pounds 40m in the past year would rise to about Pounds 60m in the
current year.
Mr Clark said that from 1993 onwards the group would generate substantial
cashflow. Meanwhile, interest cover was comfortable. He expected borrowings
to remain at the same absolute level during the current year, but gearing
would fall as shareholders' funds rose.
Profits increases were recorded by all four of Northern Foods' divisions.
Group trading profits rose 23 per cent to Pounds 137.5m. The dairy division
raised profits by 25 per cent to Pounds 62.5m on sales 27 per cent higher at
Pounds 568.6m.
The slight weakening in margins was accounted for by the inclusion of
Express Dairy. Significant savings are expected from the closure of two
dairies and the head office in London and a Pounds 9m spending programme at
the Express dairy in Ruislip, west London.
The convenience food division raised profits 35 per cent to Pounds 29.4m on
turnover of Pounds 379.8m, some 34 per cent ahead. Underlying growth was 10
per cent. This included Eden Vale, the chilled dairy products business
acquired with Express Dairy.
Mr Chris Haskins, chairman, said he expected margins at Eden Vale to double
eventually when its head office had been closed, private label business was
introduced and more marketing effort was put into brands such as Ski
yoghurt.
Meat had a flat second half, leaving profits for the year 9 per cent up at
Pounds 24.1m (Pounds 22.1m).
Recession affected sales to the catering industry, while the poultry
business only broke even because of the over-supply of chickens. Grocery
products, including Fox's biscuits, achieved a 21 per cent profit rise to
Pounds 21.5m.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Aerospace recession behind 35% contraction
at JFB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DEEP recession in the aerospace industry dealt a heavy blow to profits
at Johnson &amp; Firth Brown, the metals and engineering company which yesterday
revealed a 35 per cent drop in interim profits from Pounds 5.08m to Pounds
3.31m pre-tax.
Mr David Hall, joint managing director, said the group had been forced to
sustain 'constant pressure on margins to . . . maintain market share'.
Operating profits at the Firth Rixson subsidiary, which relies mainly on
aerospace customers for its rolled rings used in engines, collapsed from
Pounds 2.1m to Pounds 673,000 as a result.
On a brighter note, Mr Hall said the group was beginning to see signs of
life in aerospace. Mr George Hardie, joint managing director, said that
orders in the second quarter had been better than the first and that trend
was continuing.
'But it is a very shallow line, and we are not expecting a massive upsurge,'
he added.
During the year JFB sought to cut costs by reducing its workforce, mainly in
Firth Rixson, by more than 10 per cent.
The Pounds 250,000 redundancy costs had been taken out of profits in the
first half.
Sales for the six months to March 31 were marginally lower at Pounds 60.3m
(Pounds 60.9m), but were buoyed by the inclusion for the full half year of
Monroe Forgings in the US and Cobden Chadwick.
Two further acquisitions were made during the half year at a cost of Pounds
3.5m.
Benefits to the rest of the company of the Monroe acquisition, which opened
the door to aerospace engine giants such as GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney, were not
expected to come through for at least another 12 months, Mr Hall said.
However, JFB was now for the first time included on the tender lists for
orders from companies such as GE.
Light engineering suffered a gentle decline from Pounds 2.3m to Pounds 2.2m,
cushioned by a series of small acquisitions, Mr Hardie said.
Casting benefited from acquisitions to contribute Pounds 783,000 (Pounds
465,000).
Capital expenditure was running at roughly double the Pounds 3.5m annual
depreciation charge. Net cash balances totalled Pounds 12.5m.
Earnings per share fell from 2.9p to 1.6p; the interim dividend is
maintained at 1p.
JFB also announced the appointment of Mr Martin Llowarch the former British
Steel chief executive, as deputy chairman.
'We are very pleased,' said Mr Hardie. 'We consider it quite a coup.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Morrison Construction down 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORRISON Construction, the privately-owned Scottish building company,
increased turnover and operating profits in the year to March 31 but
experienced a 10 per cent fall in pre-tax profits.
The pre-tax line was Pounds 5.1m (Pounds 5.7m) on sales ahead 9 per cent to
Pounds 193.2m.
Operating profit was up 4 per cent at Pounds 5.6m.
In 1989 Morrison increased in size by two and half times when Mr Fraser
Morrison, chairman, and his family acquired the outstanding 80 per cent of
the company from Charter Consolidated.
The group operates in both Scotland and England, but avoids the south-east.
The building and property development division proved successful last year
but the small housebuilding sector lost money and the civil engineering
division encountered problems on a pipeline contract although it continued
to operate profitably.
Morrison, which has no other foreign operations, was the only British
company to win emergency repair orders in Kuwait after the Gulf war from the
US Corps of Engineers, a fact which Mr Keith Howell, finance director, said
was due to the company's ability to promise speedy mobilisation and to its
existing contacts in Saudi Arabia.
The Pounds 12m worth of orders in Kuwait produced Pounds 1m of operating
profit which Mr Morrison called an 'excellent result.'
Morrison now has nil gearing and enjoys positive cash balances.
Mr Morrrison said he expected only a gradual recovery in construction
markets.
Mr Howell said that seeking a Stock Exchange quote was an option the company
was 'holding open until the time is right.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Northumbrian Water ahead 30%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTHUMBRIAN Water, the smallest of the 10 water and sewage companies by
market capitalisation, yesterday announced a 30 per cent increase in
profits, the biggest rise so far in this year's reporting season.
Mr David Cranston, chief executive, said increases in profits and turnover
were mainly due to last year's 16.7 per cent average price rises, but the
company also managed to improve its operating margins.
Northumbrian lifted pre-tax profits from Pounds 46.9m to Pounds 61.1m in the
year to March 31. This followed a 35 per cent increase at the interim stage
to Pounds 31.3m (Pounds 23.1m).
Turnover increased by 22 per cent to Pounds 204m (Pounds 167m). Core,
regulated water sales increased by some 16 per cent to Pounds 170m (Pounds
147m).
Unlike water companies in the south of England where recession hit harder,
turnover from industrial users held to forecast.
Northumbrian said its 'enterprise', or unregulated, companies increased
sales threefold. But operating results were 'insignificant', and
Northumbrian Environmental Management, a large waste management subsidiary,
remained loss-making.
Interest receivable fell to Pounds 4.4m (Pounds 13.3m) as net cash fell to
Pounds 6.1m (Pounds 74.7m). This was due to Northumbrian's mounting capital
investment programme, and capital expenditure for the regulated business
increased to Pounds 105m (Pounds 100m). Mr Cranston said he expected
Northumbrian to have net borrowings by the end of this year, although
gearing would remain under 20 per cent.
Earnings per share increased 31 per cent to 85.5p (65.3p). The company is
recommending a final dividend of 13.7p (12.4p) to make a total of 20.5p
(18.6p), a 10 per cent increase. Dividend cover increased to 4.2 times
(3.5).
The company faced five prosecutions for sewage treatment failures, compared
with three in the previous six-month period. Recent figures from Ofwat, the
water regulator, showing Northumbrian to have a high level of customer
complaints about water quality, were due to a mains scraping and re-lining
programme, Mr Cranston said.
COMMENT
Profits towards the top end of expectations and a generous dividend, helped
Northumbrian weather yesterday's price declines in the water sector, and the
shares recovered to close down 1p at 467p. At first sight, the company's
highlighted improvement in operating margins, up nearly 7 per cent to 27 per
cent, should stem past criticism of its cost levels. Then again, perhaps
Northumbrian could have done better considering the size of last year's
price rises and the fact that margins were helped by a lower, and therefore
curious, depreciation charge. Profits for this year of Pounds 70m (including
Pounds 7m from a one-off stock market investment fund), put the shares on a
p/e of less than 5, with a yield of 4.3. Those not yet convinced by the
company's moves into unregulated businesses, and agressive financial
management, may prefer to wait until the division produces 'significant'
results.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Chief quits at Northumbrian Fine Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Richard Adams has resigned as chief executive of Northumbrian Fine Foods,
the USM-quoted biscuit and snack maker. He has held the post for 22 years
writes Angus Foster.
Mr Kevin O'Keeffe, a non-executive director, will become non-executive
chairman. Mr John Gibson, group finance director, has been appointed acting
chief executive while a new chief executive is sought.
Mr O'Keeffe said Mr Adams had decided Northumbrian's enlarged size called
for a new style of management. 'There was no bust up,' he said.
Northumbrian's shares fell 2p to 43p. The company said pre-tax profits for
the year to March 31, due to be announced in July, are expected to be about
Pounds 700,000, compared to Pounds 264,000 in the previous period.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Overseas growth masks sharp decline to
Pounds 13.6m at Cape
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STRONG GROWTH overseas partly offset a sharp decline in the UK at Cape, the
fire protection, insulation, and building products group.
Nevertheless, pre-tax profits declined by 21 per cent to Pounds 13.6m for
the 12 months to March 31.
Mr Michael Farebrother, chief executive, said sales outside the UK had risen
by 49 per cent, to about 40 per cent of total group turnover. The strength
of the overseas businesses helped overall turnover rise by 10 per cent to
Pounds 202.9m.
Acquisitions in the Netherlands and Germany contributed Pounds 17m in sales
and about Pounds 1m in profits, Mr Farebrother said. After spending Pounds
7m on new companies and a further Pounds 8m in capital expenditure, the
group still had Pounds 16.5m (Pounds 21.7m) net cash which would be used for
further acquisitions and investment.
Mr Farebrother said the strong cash position, and the secure position of
Charter Consolidated, its 67 per cent shareholder, gave good reason to
maintain the final dividend at 7.5p, for an unchanged total of 10.5p.
Of Cape's two main divisions, building and architectural products was the
worst hit. Operating profits were sliced by 46 per cent to Pounds 6.88m amid
the depressed conditions of the UK construction industry.
Industrial services, which supplies insulation and scaffolding to the power
and petrochemical industries, increased its contribution through
acquisitions from Pounds 4.66m to Pounds 6.02m.
Cape, which was on the brink of collapse in 1985 amid the turmoil
surrounding its withdrawal from asbestos mining, had cut about 400 of its
4,000 jobs in the past year. As a result, administration costs were 13 per
cent down year on year, Mr Farebrother said.
Earnings per share, depressed by a higher tax charge, fell from 23.9p to
17p.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Daily Mail declines 5% to Pounds 22.8m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARPLY LOWER input from exceptional items resulted in a 5 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits at Daily Mail and General Trust in the six months to March
31.
Sales rose from Pounds 313.3m to Pounds 326.7m, but after a reduced
exceptional credit of Pounds 3.4m (Pounds 8.7m) the pre-tax figure was
Pounds 22.8m, against Pounds 23.9m in the previous first half.
The reduced exceptional mainly reflected lower sales of Reuters shares.
Newspapers increased their contribution to Pounds 31.3m (Pounds 28.3m). The
group's three main titles, published by Associated Newspapers, are the Daily
Mail and Mail on Sunday and the Evening Standard. The performance benefited
from increased revenues from circulation and display advertising combined
with lower raw materials costs.
The group also includes Northcliffe Newspapers, Euromoney Publications and
Harmsworth Media.
Trading profit of other media activities jumped to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds
700,000) on sales of Pounds 32.5m (Pounds 27.9m). Revenues increased from
Euromoney magazines and contributions improved from new areas such as
energy, law and tax publications.
Other activities lost Pounds 1.4m (Pounds 200,000 profit) on lower turnover
of Pounds 19.5m (Pounds 22.7m).
Income from associated undertakings fell due to lower trading profits at
Bristol Evening Post and Whittle Communications in the US.
The pre-tax figure also included the sale of the company's wharf in
Purfleet, east London, which produced a profit of Pounds 10.4m. However,
there was also a property provision of Pounds 8.1m reflecting the state of
the London office property market.
Net borrowings fell Pounds 8m since the year end to Pounds 370m at March 31.
An extraordinary item of Pounds 5.5m accounted for the sale of Argus Shield,
the security services business, to Pinkertons of the US and Adverkit, the
graphics arts business.
The interim dividend is 32p (29p) on earnings of 155.2p (196.3p) per share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Porter Chadburn, the leisure products, notepaper and labels producer,
announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 5.59m for the year to March 27.
That compared with Pounds 5.32m last time, restated to reclassify
extraordinary reorganisation costs as exceptional.
Mr Raymond Dinkin, chairman, said that without the restatement profits would
have been 20 per cent lower than last year.
He said the results, which included Pounds 1m from the sale of part of the
packaging division, had been severely affected by the UK recession and
certain management and control weaknesses in the consumer leisure division
where operating profits fell from Pounds 4.98m to Pounds 1.9m.
Profits from packaging were Pounds 2.63m (Pounds 1.7m) and specialist
distribution Pounds 1.61m (Pounds 1.93m).
Group turnover increased to Pounds 132m (Pounds 112m).
Earnings per share fell from 5.65p to 5.18p and a final dividend of 1.65p is
recommended for a total of 2.5p (2.4p).

Comac Group, the USM-quoted supplier of specialist staff for the computer
industry, reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 362,424 for the year to
end-December.
This compares with losses of Pounds 34,853 last time and consolidates the
turnround to profits of Pounds 187,000 at the interim stage.
The result was struck on turnover down slightly from Pounds 10.4m to Pounds
9.97m. At the operating level profits grew from Pounds 62,508 to Pounds
439,641.
Income from interests in an associated undertaking fell from Pounds 50,675

85,161.
Earnings per share were 4.05p (0.75p losses).

In demanding market conditions AH Ball Group managed a 16 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits, from Pounds 825,000 to Pounds 960,000, in the 12 months to
March 31.
Sales were little changed at Pounds 5.75m.
The USM-quoted civil engineer said that the malaise in the construction
industry continued to affect the water and gas market sectors.
However, profit margins in the second half benefited from adjusted
depreciation rates, and the commercial completion of contracts substantially
finished in the first half.
A recommended final dividend of 4.8p brings the total to 7p (6.75p).
Earnings per share were 10.19p (8.04p).
The shares added 10p to 160p.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: M&amp;A to dispose of 2,000 poster sites
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVAS, the French parent of Mills &amp; Allen, the UK outdoor poster company,
yesterday agreed to abide by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's ruling
that its British subsidiary must dispose of 2,000 sites acquired last year.
Due to the complex history of these particular roadside sites, the parent
company was required to give its own undertaking - in addition to that of
its UK subsidiary - to sell panels acquired through the purchase of Brunton
Curtis in April 1991.
An MMC inquiry into MAI, Mills &amp; Allen's previous owner, in 1987 had ordered
the disposal of these same sites which were subsequently sold to Brunton
Curtis. The purchase of Brunton by M&amp;A revived the commission's original
objections, even though it was under new ownership.
The sites to be sold include all 48-sheet (10 ft by 20 ft) or larger panels
owned by Brunton Curtis when it was acquired by M&amp;A.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Estate agency loss leaves Hambros lower
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAMBROS, the merchant bank and financial services group, yesterday reported
a fall of 8 per cent, from Pounds 80.4m to Pounds 74.4m, in pre tax profits
for the year to March 31, mainly due to losses in the group's estate agency
business.
Mr Charles Hambro, chairman, said: 'Economic conditions both at home and
abroad continue to remain somewhat uncertain.'
Retail financial services, which consist mainly of Hambro Countrywide, the
estate agency operation, incurred losses of Pounds 6.3m compared with Pounds
800,000. The losses were largely due to the Pounds 4m cost of setting up
non-mortgage products.
Although Hambro Countrywide increased its sales of houses by 8 per cent to
over 40,000 in a declining national market, the merchant banking and
financial services group said the year had started very slowly.
Since the general election there has been increased activity in the housing
market but Mr Hambro warned that 'more time and solid evidence' was still
needed before one could speak of a firm recovery.
A strong performance from the banking division, which increased profits from
Pounds 69.2m to Pounds 73.4m, was mainly due to Eurobond and Treasury
operations. Income from corporate finance also increased on the back of some
big rights issues in the UK and European cross-border transactions.
Provisions for bad debts were higher at Pounds 13m (Pounds 8m). However, Mr
Chips Keswick, deputy chairman, said the largest single debt was Pounds 3m
and there were no loans to the property market.
Hambros is also involved in eastern European privatisation, such as the
paper and pulp mills in Czechoslovakia and Poland and is working as
contractors for the government know-how fund in the Ukraine.
Profits from direct investments fell from Pounds 28m to Pounds 24.1m.
Berkeley Hambro increased its retail income by 18 per cent but had to
provide against a fall in asset values.
On the UK investment side the group said it was working on five unlisted
investments with a book value of Pounds 4m.
Fully diluted earnings per share were 25.4p (27p). The final dividend is
increased to 9.6p (8.8p) making a total of 13.8p.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Across the board improvement at Racal -
Interest charges reduced to Pounds 17.7m as borrowings are cut by more than
Pounds 100m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOST impressive element of Racal Electronics' Pounds 55.6m pre-tax
profits reported yesterday is the exceptional strength of its cash
generation.
As a result, debt has fallen to Pounds 121m from the Pounds 225m it stood at
after the demerger of Vodafone Group last September. While Pounds 40m came
from tighter working capital control, even more was generated from
operations which last year made combined losses of Pounds 21m at the pre-tax
level.
There is nothing like being on the receiving end of a hostile bid - that
fails - to sharpen up a company's operations. What it means is that both
Chubb, the security division which is to be floated this October, and the
remaining Racal businesses will carry a considerably more manageable debt
load, with all that means for interest payments and the ability to grow by
acquisition.
The turnaround appears to have been across the board. Most impressive, for a
business thought to have been in a cash cow phase of its business cycle, is
the 20 per cent increase in operating profits to Pounds 53.8m at Chubb on
sales up only 3 per cent at Pounds 669m.
Also improving was the radio communications division, where profits almost
doubled to Pounds 22.5m, mostly on the back of successes in the US and
Canada.
The marine and energy division, part of which was believed to be up for
sale, increased profits from Pounds 14.98m to Pounds 16.29m, as a result of
improvements in the energy area. Sir Ernest Harrison, Racal chairman, said
yesterday that the Marine division will not be sold.
Network services, which includes the service which carries data between
government departments, bounced from losses of Pounds 14.36m to losses of
only Pounds 306,000 as the investment programme and start-up costs came to
an end.
Defence radar and avionics improved from losses of Pounds 335,000 to a
Pounds 6.38m profit and could be the exciting new division of the late 1990s
if Racal is as successful as it hopes to be in developing the
telephones-in-aeroplanes market that Racal says has a potential for sales of
Dollars 1bn within 10 years.
The Achilles' heel remained the data communications division which, after
Chubb, is the largest business area with sales of Pounds 323.7m producing
profits of Pounds 1.82m. This improvement from losses of Pounds 11.8m partly
reflected restructuring but the market is, and will remain after the
recession ends, particularly competitive in the US.
Sir Ernest recognises that unless profitability is improved here, benefits
emerging from improvements in the other divisions could be dwarfed.
'The key is to get profitability into data communications,' Sir Ernest said.
As a result of the reduced level of debt, the interest charge during the
year fell from Pounds 37.47m to Pounds 17.7m and gearing fell from 35.4 per
cent to 19.1 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 2.3p from losses of 2.01p and the company is
proposing a final dividend of 0.7p, giving a total of 1p.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Saatchi confirms seamless transition at the
top - The appointee who will take control of the group's gradual recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAATCHI &amp; Saatchi yesterday confirmed at its annual meeting in London that
Mr Charles Scott, currently chief operating officer, will assume the role of
chief executive from June 1993, replacing Mr Robert Louis-Dreyfus, who will
resign from all functions.
At one level the move comes as something of a surprise, though it has been a
poorly-kept secret for some time that Mr Louis-Dreyfus wished to move on.
He was brought in in January 1990 to draw up and implement a rescue
operation, a recapitalisation scheme which, 16 months later, was
successfully in place. Although the group is no longer on the deathbed, it
is still in convalescence.
In March the group reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 58.4m, on a annualised
basis, to the end of December 1991, against pre-tax profits of Pounds 35.6m
for the year to September 1990.
It is still facing earn-out payment burdens of Pounds 21m this year, rising
to Pounds 28m in 1993, but falling to Pounds 13m and Pounds 10m in the
following two years. Net debt in the final quarter of 1991 averaged Pounds
200m.
But on another level, the appointment of Mr Scott will be as close as
possible to a seamless transition.
Mr Louis-Dreyfus brought Mr Scott into Saatchi to assist with the
refinancing negotiations. Thus the move recognises Mr Scott's key role in
bringing financial control back to an organisation which was rapidly sliding
into shambles. The two will be working in tandem for the coming year, as
they have since January 1990.
Mr Scott says that it is difficult to outline financial targets over the
short term due to the depressed state of world economies. 'The reality is
that to sit here now and say how much revenues are going to increase in 1993
is not a sound basis for planning.'
Improving group performance will not be easy this year, when advertising
revenue projections of 2 per cent real growth are already being revised
downwards. How will Mr Louis-Dreyfus and Mr Scott improve operating margins
from the 'clearly unacceptable' 2.8 per cent 1991 level to their target of
reaching 10 per cent in the next three years?
Mr Scott sees the key in dealing with loss-making areas: 'Whatever happens
to revenues, we will raise margins to 10 per cent by the elimination of
loss-making concerns, either by turning them into profit or closing them
down. I don't think we would necessarily sell companies in order to raise
margins; though we would sell them if we don't see them as being a core
business for the company.'
Thus while the group's two international advertising networks, (Saatchi &amp;
Saatchi Worldwide and BSB), the direct mail company (Kobs and Draft), its
public relations company (Rowland), and its media-buying arm (Zenith) are
seen by both men as central, a sprinkling of smaller US and UK companies are
going to come under close scrutiny.
'We don't anticipate that there will be any loss-making operations by 1993,'
says Mr Scott. One plan likely to come to fruition before the end of 1993 is
to expand Zenith's media-buying operation through a European link.
Mr Scott can hardly be further removed from the common image of an
advertising person; he epitomises caution and exudes thoughtfulness. Thus he
was keen to emphasise the gradualist approach he has to steering Saatchi
back onto the straight and narrow.
For 1992, he is content to hope for small but real improvements: 'It will be
a year not dissimilar to last year, with things showing constant
improvements. We have been working all the time on rationalising the company
and that will continue. My particular role is to improve the earnings as
much as possible.'

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: G Wood provides new platform for Bristol
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL Bristol, who sold out of Brompton Holdings a year ago, is
re-entering the UK stock market through the refinancing of Graham Wood, a
structural engineer.
He said that, after making the group safe, he would use it to make
acquisitions. This might take him back into the oil services sector. He used
to be involved in Oilfield Inspection Services and Bristol Oil and Minerals.
More recently he built up Brompton, a USM-quoted safety inspection and
testing group, which was taken over by Adia of Switzerland, last June in an
Pounds 11.7m deal. Mr Bristol had a 16 per cent stake.
Graham Wood announced yesterday that Mr Bristol was proposing a significant
cash injection and had become executive chairman.
The shares were suspended at 16p after receivers were appointed to Blight &amp;
White, a structural steel subsidiary. Although it had completed work on such
prestige projects as Euro-Disney and the centre court at Wimbledon, its
latest big contract was for Olympia &amp; York at Canary Wharf.
Mr Bristol said it seemed unlikely to get payments of up to Pounds 400,000
and that was the last straw. Its debts amounted to about Pounds 2.5m.
The remainder of the group, including its main Graham Wood Structural
subsidiary, was unaffected by the receivership as there were no
cross-guarantees.
However, borrowings of Pounds 5m remained and discussions about the
refinancing were taking place with the Royal Bank of Scotland.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Electrocomponents declines to Pounds 49.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Electrocomponents rose 17p to 284p after the distributor of
electronic, mechanical and electrical components reported a drop in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 55.2m to Pounds 49.9m in the year to March 31.
Mr Robert Lawson, chief executive since April 1991, ascribed the share price
rise to three factors: increased operating profits from the core RS
Components business; 'demonstrable' cash management across the group, which
has cut gearing from 28 per cent to nil; and a higher-than-expected final
dividend of 5.1p (4.8p) for a total of 7p (6.6p).
RS, which in November added mechanical products and tools to its electronic
and electrical products catalogue business, achieved a Pounds 400,000 rise
in operating profits to Pounds 56.9m on sales 9.6 per cent ahead at Pounds
275.2m. Mr Lawson said this was in spite of the recessionary conditions in a
'difficult year', the payment of rates for 10 months as a result of the
termination of the Corby Enterprise Zone, and the Pounds 3m budgeted
start-up losses from the fledgling RS Germany.
RS's 'encouraging performance' was offset by an operating decline from
Pounds 1.3m to Pounds 600,000 at Pact International, which distributes
components to the retail market.
Misco Group, the computer supplies catalogue business, also had 'an
extremely difficult year', said Sir Keith Bright, chairman. It tumbled to
operating losses of Pounds 3m (profits Pounds 2m) on sales down at Pounds
71.7m (Pounds 74.2m).
Group turnover fell 5 per cent to Pounds 395.1m and there were exceptional
costs of Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 600,000). Below the line there were
extraordinary charges of Pounds 31m (Pounds 27.6m) - Pounds 24.4m of this
relates to the restructure of Misco and the balance to the sale of Mesa
Distribution of the US.
Earnings were 15.3p (17.4p) per share.
COMMENT
Having realised the recovery would not be short and sharp, the slow, steady
progress at RS is increasingly valued. And the new management's clear
strategy to refocus the group, cut out peripherals, and expand beneath the
umbrella of RS's solid distribution network is welcomed. A one-concept,
rather than a one-business, company is not a worry as catalogue-selling has
proven to be sturdy enough through the recession.
Adding part two (mechanical products and tools) to the catalogue has been
well received and goes to show that the same concept could be applicable
across different technologies. Finally the success of RS's overseas
expansion bodes well for the future, though it may be next year before the
benefits are apparent. Full-year pre-tax estimates were upgraded from Pounds
54m-Pounds 57m to Pounds 56m-Pounds 60m, giving a prospective multiple of
about 17, which seems reasonable.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Muted cheers for the single market: Attempts to unify
European securities
</HEADLINE>

Banks and securities firms in the UK were clearly relieved yesterday
following a breakthrough in negotiations between EC governments which could
lead to the creation of a single European securities market.
Most acknowledged that agreement on the draft Capital Adequacy Directive,
which lays down the amount of capital needed by EC securities firms and the
trading operations of banks, is a significant step towards a desirable goal.
Moreover, many of the proposals which would have damaged the London market
have been dropped.
However, some market participants remained circumspect. 'It is too soon to
proclaim victory,' said the legal director at a leading London securities
firm. 'The whole project hangs on the details and how the directive is
implemented.'
The agreement among governments yesterday covered only the general terms of
the CAD. The final document is still subject to political approval by
finance ministers when they meet on June 29.
The general agreement still leaves several important areas undecided. For
example, there is no agreement on the absolute minimum amount of capital
which a recognised investment firm should carry.
To some in the market the lack of a detailed agreement was good news - they
had feared the commission would hurry through detailed proposals. 'It is a
lot better than it might have been,' said Mr Paul Tillett, deputy secretary
of the British Bankers Association. 'The best news of all is that more
drafting will take place. In a directive like this the details are
all-important.'
Even once the details are agreed, the ratification and implementation of the
directive will be linked to agreement on the draft Investment Services
Directive, which should give securities firms a 'single passport' to conduct
business in all EC centres. The ISD has been stalled for months and
disagreements between national governments appear to be intractable. This
means that the capital adequacy requirements may not come into force for
some time.
However, EC finance ministers have agreed a basic framework. Securities
firms and the securities trading operations of banks will be able to boost
core equity capital by raising short-term subordinated loans. This
additional layer of capital is not available to banks in their non-trading
operations under existing EC rules.
Yesterday's agreement recognises as capital subordinated debt up to 250 per
cent of core equity capital.
There will be no inflexible upper limit on the size of large securities
exposures. In early drafts, some governments had wanted a 25 per cent limit
on securities exposures. This would have stopped firms undertaking large
exposures by underwriting block trades, for example.
Instead, the directive will allow a 10-day underwriting window in which
normal capital requirements do not apply. Capital requirements will then
gradually start to apply according to an agreed formula.
The biggest victory for the UK government, and the London securities market,
is an agreement that all stock borrowing and repurchase agreements will fall
under the CAD, rather than tougher banking regulations.
Under earlier drafts, stock borrowed by a securities firm or bank from a
pension fund or a company would be treated as a loan rather than a trading
position. Tougher capital requirements would have applied, increasing the
cost of stock borrowing and potentially damaging the liquidity of the London
market, where stock borrowing and repurchase are most common.
The precise effects of the CAD will depend on the type of securities
business being undertaken by a firm or bank. Although the UK won some
important concessions, some sectors of the London market could still suffer;
for example, underwriting firms in the London-based Eurobond market, which
have traditionally taken on very large exposures sometimes over long
periods.
The EC knew of the potential impact of the CAD on the London market. Sir
Leon Brittan, EC Commissioner responsible for financial services, said: 'I
have been well aware of the concern expressed by some in the City of London
and also in other financial centres in the community about the potential
pitfalls in this area. I'm glad that agreement has now been reached on a set
of proposals which in no way prevent the continuation of present trading
activity in the community or anywhere else.'
However, some London bankers said the CAD would still probably require them
to maintain higher levels of capital for most types of business than under
current national rules.
In other European financial centres, reaction was equally cool. The
consensus in Paris was that the new regulations would make very little
difference to trading in France, where the existing capital requirements on
securities dealing are already comparatively high.
While the main features of the CAD now appear to be fixed, the directive
will be reviewed within three years to ensure that it is consistent with
similar rules being drafted by other international regulators; the Basle
committee of central bank regulators, and the International Organisation of
Securities Commissions.
Foreign bankers said the directive could provide a model for these other
international regulators to follow. 'It appears to be a sensible compromise
between the interests of banks and and the interests of securities firms. It
is certainly an advance over the system of regulation which applies in the
US,' said one senior US banker in London.
Meanwhile, UK government officials were keen to portray the agreement as a
significant step forward, containing several measures to protect the
interest of the London market. Today, bankers and securities market
practitioners will attend detailed Treasury briefings, but with a sense of
hope rather than dread.

FT  11 JUN 92 / TI Group wins bid battle for Dowty: Enlarged engineering
company to join FT-SE 100 - Combined sales will reach Pounds 1.2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI GROUP, the specialist engineering company, yesterday won overwhelming
support for its hostile bid for Dowty Group, the Cheltenham-based aerospace
and information technology group that is among the best-known names in
British engineering.
By the close of the bid yesterday, 60.23 per cent of Dowty's shareholders
had accepted the share and cash offers which valued Dowty at about Pounds
510m.
The successful bid will leapfrog TI into the FT-SE 100 index and will make
the group the second largest UK engineering company behind British
Aerospace.
The enlarged group will have three divisions - aerospace, engineered seals
and pipes - each with sales of about Pounds 400m - operating throughout the
world.
Dowty's aerospace division, which is the prize in yesterday's successful
bid, will remain in Cheltenham where it made landing gear for all Royal Air
Force aeroplanes that flew during the Second World War.
'We are clearly delighted with the result,' said Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI
chairman, 'Our priority now is to get down to the real task of returning
Dowty to its core specialised engineering businesses of aerospace and
polymer engineering.'
Mr Lewinton will meet the Dowty board in London today. 'I will explain that
we are trying to build a great British engineering company,' he said. 'The
takeover is good news for Dowty, good news for TI and good news for British
engineering.'
Among the first steps TI will take is to establish with its advisers
Barings, the merchant bank, whether its assumptions about Dowty's
Information Technology division fit with the actual situation ahead of a
likely sale.
The division was most responsible for Dowty's weak earnings and profits
performance in recent years and contributed perhaps more than anything to
TI's victory yesterday.
TI's advisers and its finance team will go to Cheltenham tomorrow to look
over Information Technology and to begin the process of putting Dowty's
management accounts on to TI's reporting system.
Mr Lewinton yesterday dismissed fears about the company's future expressed
during the bid by Dowty's labour force. The fears were based on uncertainty
and stemmed from the large numbers of redundancies in the aerospace industry
in recent years.
First indications last night were that of the 60.23 per cent acceptances
from shareholders, the majority took the four-for-fifteen share offer in
preference to the 175p cash alternative.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Shares in Northern Foods jump after strong result
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in Northern Foods, the dairy, convenience food, meat and grocery
group, jumped 14p to 605p yesterday as the group announced a 19.7 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 126.2m in spite of a competitive
market. Mr Chris Haskins, chairman, said the figures represented 'excellent
progress'.
He said pressure from food retailers had made the industry very competitive,
but Northern had seen good sales growth from its four main customers, Marks
and Spencer, J. Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway. These four account for nearly
40 per cent of group sales which were 21.7 per cent higher at Pounds 1.4bn.
Mr Haskins said sales were running ahead of budget so far in the current
year but this had been achieved by giving up some margin. He expected
profits to accelerate through the year, as benefits from rationalisation and
capital expenditure came through.
Several acquisitions helped boost profits, although the largest, the Pounds
326m purchase of Express Dairies and Eden Vale from Grand Metropolitan, was
completed only two months before the financial year ended in March.
Acquisitions made since April 1990 contributed Pounds 9.5m after financing
costs. Operating profits rose 10 per cent excluding acquisitions.
Finance charges rose from Pounds 3.5m to Pounds 7.8m as the impact of higher
borrowings began to be felt. Profit-sharing took Pounds 3.5m, against Pounds
2.7m last time.
Earnings per share were 16.8 per cent higher at 38.31p, (against 32.79p last
time, after adjusting for the rights issue). A final dividend of 9.27p is
proposed, to give a total of 15.75p, a rise of 14.8 per cent on the previous
year's 13.72p adjusted for the rights.
Mr Haskins said the planned abolition of the Milk Marketing Board in 1994
should be positive for the group. It aimed to buy milk directly from farmers
and believed it would be more efficient than the MMB.
The current pricing system for milk, with prices depending on the end use of
the milk, meant Northern paid a substantial premium, of about 2p a litre,
for its milk. This cost the group about Pounds 40m a year, he said.
Mr Haskins said that when he started in the industry in 1962 the price of a
pint of milk, a standard loaf of bread and a pint of beer was about the
same. The pint of milk was now the cheapest, which he said showed it was the
most efficient of the three industries.

FT  11 JUN 92 / UN paves the way for supply troops in Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UNITED NATIONS military officers arrived in Sarajevo yesterday to prepare
the way for 1,000 UN troops who hope to lift the siege on the city's airport
and allow the transport of supplies for thousands of residents.
The officials hope to arrange the removal of all anti-aircraft weapons held
by Serb irregulars surrounding the airport and oversee their withdrawal from
the immediate vicinity.
UN officials stressed that the operation 'was highly dangerous' since it
depended on all sides honouring a ceasefire. The officials also warned that
they did not have the means to provide air cover for the UN troops.
'Ceasefires come and go, but we have to keep trying,' said Mr Cedric
Thornberry, the UN's chief negotiator.
Last weekend, Mr Thornberry forged an agreement between the Bosnian
presidency and the Serb army in Bosnia, led by General Ratko Mladic and Mr
Radovan Karadzic, to reopen the airport.
In Washington, a senior US senator warned that military action might be
needed to curb Serbia's territorial ambitions. 'The time for drawing the
line has come,' said Senator Richard Lugar, a Republican from Indiana.
'The UN should authorise nation states to use force. Nato should draw up
plans for a comprehensive use of force as thorough as that formulated for
air, sea and ground forces in Desert Storm,' he added.
Senator Lugar's intervention is an attempt to end US political indifference
to events in Bosnia-Hercegovina. This afternoon the Senate foreign relations
committee is to take public discussion further in special hearings.
A convoy of 41 UN cars, trucks and an armoured personnel carrier left
Belgrade on the 180-mile drive to Sarajevo, where 300,000 residents are
trapped by fighting and face starvation. Rival militias kept up shelling and
street battles in the city yesterday.
The UN troops, drawn from Canada's Royal 22nd Regiment, are preparing to
leave Sector D, the UN-protected area in central Croatia, where they have
been deployed for some weeks.
They will be equipped with 80 armoured personnel carriers to safeguard the
flow of humanitarian relief supplies through the airport into Sarajevo.
Under the terms of the agreement, the airport can only be opened once all
anti-aircraft weapons have been withdrawn from surrounding areas. Those
areas will then be placed under UN supervision.
In addition, all artillery, mortars, surface-to-surface missiles and tanks
that are within range of the airport will be concentrated in areas agreed by
the UN.
If these terms are met, the airport will be brought under the control of the
UN, which will supervise air traffic. That will comprise humanitarian aid,
and UN and other official missions.
The UN will also throw a ring around the airport and establish two corridors
into Sarajevo to send in food to the city, which will be under UN
supervision.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Letter: Negative equity overstated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ADRIAN COLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The estimate of the number of borrowers with negative equity, which
early drafts of a Phillips and Drew report suggest is between 1.5m and 2m -
and which you reported on June 6 ('Homes that fail to hold their value') -
ignores four crucial factors.
The report assumes that anyone obtaining a mortgage of 90 per cent of the
purchase price in, say, 1988 and who has since seen house prices fall by
more than 10 per cent, now has negative equity. However, 750,000 council
houses were sold at an average discount to market value of 50 per cent
between 1987 and 1991. Sitting tenant council house purchasers would need to
experience price reductions of at least 50 per cent before entering negative
equity statistics.
The report assumes no one who purchased between 1987 and 1991 has
subsequently moved. This is an extreme assumption which clearly exaggerates
the number of borrowers with negative equity.
The report assumes that borrowers do not make any repayments. There has been
a sharp increase in the flow of regular repayments, the figure for building
societies alone rising from less than Pounds 2bn to more than Pounds 4.5bn
between 1989 and 1991. The amount of lump sum repayments not associated with
redemption has also more than doubled to more than Pounds 2bn over the same
period.
Some borrowers do have negative equity. However, concentration on the
relationship between one asset (home) and one liability (mortgage) tells us
nothing about the ability of borrowers to move home. In many cases,
especially in northern England, the extent of negative equity can be
measured in hundreds, rather than thousands of pounds. A major weakness of
the report is its inability to quantify the cash sums involved.
There are other technical comments that one might make on the report.
Overall, however, the 1.5m estimate of borrowers with negative equity
significantly over-estimates the true situation. Adrian Coles,

FT  11 JUN 92 / Letter: EC leaders failed to explain subsidiarity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr STANLEY CROSSICK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, 'Unnecessary in its goals, obscure in its language, incompetent in its
detail, the Maastricht Treaty has few redeeming features,' wrote Martin Wolf
('A break in the march of history', June 6). His article fails to support
such an assertion.
Moreover, in declaring that 'nothing in historical experience suggests such
a structure is feasible, let alone desirable,' Mr Wolf reveals an
unwillingness to learn from, or even understand, history.
Martin Wolf is, however, right in stating that the treaty is basically about
power - but not the abuse of power nor the balance of power.
Recognising the long-term limits of intergovernmental co-operation, the
Maastricht Treaty continues the policy of European integration and
interdependence.
Moreover, it introduces the principle of subsidiarity, ie that the Community
shall act 'only if and in so far as the objectives of the proposed action
cannot be sufficiently achieved by the member states and can therefore, by
reason of the scale or effects of the proposed action, be better achieved by
the Community.'
Unfortunately, Community leaders have failed to explain to the people - let
alone convince them - that the principle of subsidiarity guarantees that
there will in future be no unnecessary interference from Brussels.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Letter: Minister has not dealt with many problems of
contracting out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms ELIZABETH SYMONS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I add a few points to your balanced and thoughtful editorial on the
'Long road to Whitehall reform' (June 3), without falling into the category
of 'the reservations so skilfully expressed in Whitehall'?
Representing almost 80 per cent of the senior civil servants in Whitehall,
the FDA welcomes minister of public service William Waldegrave's support in
our campaign for greater openness which we have pursued since 1986, often in
opposition to the government and Conservative backbenchers.
But Mr Waldegrave did not deal with many of the serious problems underlying
the contracting out of central government services.
For example, the issue of impartiality. We are not told whether each part of
the civil service to be contracted out will have its own 'watch-dog' body,
but an enormous proliferation of such regulators can be anticipated if
public confidence in impartiality is to be maintained.
Or confidentiality. How will the private sector guarantee confidentiality
when it is dealing with our tax affairs? How many businesses in the
commercial arena want their business competitors to be fully conversant with
their financial affairs?
Then there is the risk of conflicts of interest. For example, a legal firm
may be in difficulty when dealing with a customer in a manner which is
prejudicial to the public interest, while at the same time retaining a
contract for government work.
Finally, at senior levels, those in the private sector are consistently very
much better paid and more expensive than their civil service counterparts.
Barristers' advice in the civil service costs about Pounds 60,000 a year
whereas the private sector pays well over double that figure.
Sadly we lack a real public debate. The contracting out of individual parts
of the civil service will need no parliamentary debate, so the necessity of
an independent assessment of real value for money will become vitally
important.
We have suggested to William Waldegrave that all tenders for contracting out
work should be referred to the comptroller and auditor general. We hope our
suggestion, which is designed to be helpful, will receive a fair hearing.

FT  11 JUN 92 / No shelter from the storm: Imposition of UN sanctions
against Serbia is exacerbating fears that the civil war will spread to the
republic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the balmy heat of Belgrade, the Serbian capital, the impact of the United
Nations sanctions imposed on Serbia and its ally, Montenegro, a week ago
appear as far removed as the fighting and killing in neighbouring
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Young and old sip Turkish coffees and smoke western cigarettes in the
outdoor cafes. Smartly dressed drivers in their BMWs and Mercedes speed up
and down the main boulevards. There is little to disturb the peace in
Belgrade. Unlike Croatia, or Bosnia, war has never touched the people of
Serbia.
Yet many in the capital are afraid that the republic will soon be engulfed
in civil war - a fear heightened by the imposition of sanctions. Those who
have the money are beginning to stockpile food and other provisions in their
cellars. Petrol is now rationed, with private car owners limited to 30
litres a month per car. Prices of basic goods have doubled in the past week.
The country's steel mills are running out of coke and iron ore imported from
Latin America and eastern Europe. Even the mint in Serbia is unable to print
money. It is running out of dinars, the unit of currency, because the
watermark and paper are imported from the republic of Slovenia, which has
also brought sanctions against Serbia.
The sanctions, which include a complete trade embargo on everything from
textiles to cigarettes, the banning of all flights in and out of Serbia, a
freeze on the republic's assets held abroad, and the reduction of diplomatic
staff in embassies, were imposed by the UN on Serbia for two reasons.
First, they were aimed at forcing the Serbian president, Mr Slobodan
Milosevic, to order Serb irregulars and the the rump Yugoslav army to stop
fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Second, in a less explicit way, western
governments hoped that sanctions would lead to the overthrow of the
Milosevic regime through anti-government demonstrations, and the subsequent
installation of a pro-European democratic government in Belgrade.
So far, there are no signs that the guns will fall silent in war-torn
Bosnia. Serbian irregulars continue to expel Moslems from villages with the
aim of creating ethnically pure regions. Croatian forces continue to try to
form bridgeheads between Croatia and Croat-populated areas of Bosnia. The
population of Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, is on the verge of starvation
following a two-month siege imposed by the Serb irregulars and the Yugoslav
army.
Even if there is a formal end to the war, the desire for revenge among
Bosnia's three ethnic groups means that the killing is likely to continue -
although perhaps not so systematically - in that republic.
In an attempt to distance Serbia from the war in Bosnia, to end the UN
sanctions, Mr Milosevic is now disowning the Bosnian Serbs, whom he once
supported. He has said that Serbia is not involved in the civil war in
Bosnia-Hercegovina. His government ministers repeatedly claim that the
sanctions are unjust because Serbia is not the only guilty partner.
At the same time, the sanctions have not yet galvanised the opposition into
effective action against the Milosevic regime. This is because the
opposition is fragmented between nationalists and liberals, and both groups
are too weak to attract public support in their attempt to topple Mr
Milosevic.
For example, the armed, ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical party, led by Mr
Vojislav Seselj, regards as traitors anyone who opposes the creation of a
Greater Serbia, who wants a free press, or who advocates rights for the
ethnic minorities in Serbia. The party enjoys considerable support in the
countryside and in parts of Belgrade.
Another opposition movement, the Serbian Renewal party, based in one of
Belgrade's more fashionable suburbs, is a motley collection of nationalists,
conservatives and monarchists. Led by Mr Vuk Draskovic, one of the few Serb
politicians who spoke out against the war in Croatia and Bosnia, the Renewal
party also believes in a Greater Serbia and the re-establishment of the
former Yugoslavia on the lines of a confederation.
Hopes that the Democratic party, the most liberal of all the Serbian
opposition movements, will emerge as a viable force against the Milosevic
government remain misplaced.
Politically, its leaders want a democratic Serbia. But Mr Zoran Djindjic,
one of the Democratic party's most articulate leaders, says that speaking
openly about democracy in Serbia - which includes granting ethnic rights to
the Albanians in Kosovo, the Moslems in Sanjzak in south-western Serbia, and
the ethnic Hungarians in Vojvodina, northern Serbia - would amount to
electoral suicide.
'The civil society is very weak here. Serbs do not reflect about democracy
and its implications,' said Mr Djindjic. A senior Democratic party official
said: 'Serbs simply do not care about the ethnic minorities, particularly
the Albanians. They despise them.'
Nevertheless, in spite of such evidence of a weak attachment to democratic
political traditions in Serbia, the Democratic party wants to form a
transitional government of national consensus which would include Mr
Milosevic's ruling Serbian Socialist party. Although members of the
Socialist party are beginning to try to distance themselves from Mr
Milosevic's regime, his support is still strong enough for him to dictate
the terms of any power-sharing arrangement.
Mr Djindjic said last week a coalition government would prepare for free,
democratic elections, monitored by international observers. He admitted
that, by including socialists in any coalition government, the Democratic
party's supporters would accuse it of selling out to the Milosevic regime.
He also said that the Serbian president would try to use that government to
remain in power, or even to pre-empt efforts to bring democracy and
stability to the republic by fomenting civil war.
'The ingredients for war are all here in Serbia,' explained Mr Djindjic. He
said thousands of Yugoslav federal army officers and their families had
withdrawn into Serbia when they were forced to leave the other republics
under the terms of the UN agreement in Croatia; 500,000 refugees had fled to
Serbia from Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina; and the extreme nationalists
were jockeying for power.
Given this atmosphere of recrimination and rivalry, the Democratic party is
increasingly concerned that any delay in setting up a coalition government
will give Mr Milosevic an opportunity to orchestrate unrest in order for the
socialists to remain in power.
'Milosevic always finds a crisis to generate a conflict as a means of
deflecting Serbia's problems,' explained Mr James Gow, a specialist on the
Yugoslav army at King's College, London.
But unlike previous occasions, Mr Milosevic can no longer rely on fomenting
unrest in neighbouring republics to deflect attention from the republic's
own problems: unemployment is about 20 per cent, industrial production is
down about 20 per cent in the first quarter of this year compared with the
same period of 1991; inflation is 150 per cent a month, on top of a rate of
1,000 per cent for 1991.
Desperation at being boxed in may, however, make the Serbian president more
unpredictable in the measures he takes to stay in power. United Nations
peace-keeping troops have been deployed in Croatia. The Yugoslav federal
army has withdrawn from the independent republic of Macedonia. What remains
is Kosovo, which is the president's trump card, or potentially his Achilles'
heel, as he calculates his next move.
It was in this wretchedly poor province of 2m ethnic Albanians that Mr
Milosevic began his rise to power in 1987. By using the rhetoric of
nationalism, he accused the Albanians of persecuting the small Serb and
Montenegrin ethnic minorities.
By exploiting Serbia's historical claim on Kosovo, once the cradle of
Serbia's medieval empire, he rallied enough support to incorporate the
province forcibly into Serbia in 1990. Since then, Kosovo has been run by
Belgrade like a police state, and the civil rights of the Albanians - who
make up 90 per cent of the population - have been suppressed.
Despite this violation, the ethnic (Moslem) Albanians, led by Mr Vettin
Surroi and Mr Ibrahim Rugova, have adopted a policy of non-violence. But
western diplomats doubt that this policy can continue.
'The tension is building up in Serbia because it is sitting on a time bomb -
in Kosovo, its own back garden. Milosevic cannot hope for any stability in
the new Yugoslavia as long as he continues to repress the Albanians,' a
western diplomat said.
But Serbia is saddled with a paradox: no party in Serbia can win at the
ballot box if it guarantees to protect the civil rights of minorities in the
republic - including the ethnic Albanians. Yet no stability in Serbia is
possible without granting ethnic rights to the minorities.
The possibility of war in Kosovo is of increasing concern to western
governments, particularly the US. American diplomats say that Albania would
support its fellow ethnic Albanians in Kosovo if nationalists around Mr
Seselj or Mr Milosevic provoked a war in the province, or indeed, if the
ethnic Albanians themselves attempted to rebel against their Serb
government.
In such an event, the ethnic Albanians in neighbouring Macedonia, who make
up 20 per cent of the population, and the government of Turkey would
probably support Kosovo as well. 'Turkey has had enough of the slaughter of
their fellow Moslems in Bosnia. They won't stand idly by next time. They
might arm the ethnic Albanians,' a diplomat said.
However, few diplomats, or liberal intellectuals in Belgrade, can see a way
out of the impasse. They fear that instability triggered by an outbreak of
war in Kosovo will spread throughout the Balkans in a conflict which could
last for many years.
Western governments have so far ruled out military intervention, either in
Sarajevo or to protect Kosovo's Albanians, because they are unsure what such
a move would achieve. They are not even certain that sanctions, even if they
stay in place against Serbia for many months, will force the Serbian
leadership into starting negotiations with its ethnic Albanians. With Mr
Milosevic at the helm, and ultra-nationalists waiting for him to falter, the
depressing likelihood remains that things will get worse rather than better.
