JAPAN: THE COMING COLLAPSE By Brian Reading Weidenfeld &amp; Nicholson. Pounds
18.99. 310 pages
Contemporary western writing about Japan tends to fall into a number of
distinct genres. There is the American school of Japan-bashing, which
relates Japan's unrelenting quest for world economic domination and, in
extreme manifestations, how this will lead to war between Japan and the US.
At a somewhat subtler level are the revisionists, who seek to describe how
Japan organises its economic and social affairs and why this leads it to
indulge in unfair international trading. Conversely, there are those writers
who simply marvel at the phenomenon that is Japan's economy and want to
learn from its success.
Japan: The Coming Collapse is, as its title suggests, none of the above. It
falls into another genre which appears to be just coming into vogue: the
doomsday scenario. The startling thesis advanced by Brian Reading, a former
economics editor of The Economist, goes like this: the massive deflation of
asset values in the Tokyo stock and real estate markets of the past two
years is merely a taste of worse to come; the banking system is on the point
of collapse; growing trade friction with other industrialised countries will
help to tip the economy into a protracted recession. Worse yet, he argues,
governments will fail to produce the necessary political, economic and
social reforms, and Japanese politics will move from its current consensual
paralysis to a state of confrontation and anarchy. In short, in the book's
words, 'this is no economic superpower bent on world domination. It is a
hara-kiri economy set to self-destruct.'
Reading's analysis is as beguiling as it is compelling. Not the least of its
attractions is that it appears to point to a conclusion in which many of us
secretly want to believe: that the Japanese economy is so fundamentally
flawed that it will soon collapse under the weight of its own
contradictions, and in the process become a less daunting competitor. There
is only one problem: it is far from clear that the analysis will come true.
To be sure, the Japanese economy is not in the best of health right now.
Japanese banks are labouring under a bad-debt burden that will take years to
sort out. Bankruptcies are at record levels. The stock market is
punch-drunk, and property is still going south. The once-invincible
carmakers and electronics companies are struggling. The trade surplus is
soaring again and Japan's trade partners are looking for weapons with which
to lower it. The question is whether this all adds up to Reading's
apocalypse, or to a transformation that is less cataclysmic, more complex,
and - dare one say? - less susceptible to description in publisher-pleasing
one-liners.
Reading is at his most plausible and interesting when he is seeking to
diagnose what is demonstrably wrong with Japan's economy and society: the
defects in its tax system, which suffers rampant evasion and has long failed
to collect adequate revenues for the government; the absurdities of its
land-use policy, whereby most Japanese city-dwellers are forced to live in
little boxes, while urban farmers are subsidised for growing rice on
minuscule plots next door; the ills of money politics, and the failure of
the political system to cater to the needs of Japanese consumers as well as
producers.
Where he is less convincing is in suggesting that Japan's problems in these
respects are of a different order from those of many other industrial
countries.  And where he is not convincing at all is in predicting that all
these factors will inevitably combine with the hangover from the 1980s boom
to produce an economic and, finally, political mega crisis. The injection of
a superficial chapter covering Japan's history, from the beginning to 1945,
does not help. Nor does the repeated misspelling of the name of the Federal
Reserve chairman, Paul Volcker. The troubling fact is that signs of the
meltdown Reading describes are hard to discern in Tokyo. Yes, there is a
severe economic slowdown, and yes, the economy probably is in for a
prolonged period of slow growth even when it starts to recover. Yes, the
financial system is in trouble and will not be a source of cheap and easy
credit again for many years to come. Yes, the political system is corrupt -
probably irredeemably so.
But Japan's is scarcely expected to be the only slow-growth economy in the
1990s, and it will continue to benefit more than some others from its high
level of capital investment and savings. And while it is true that
investment yields have been miserably low in Japan for years, largely as a
result of expectations of never-ending capital growth, it is not automatic
that the end of rising share prices will cause investors to demand a quantum
leap in yields, as Reading suggests.
In short, like all polemicists, Reading overstates his case. This is a
shame, because among the prophecies of doom are some telling points about
the way Japanese society is changing and in some respects becoming more like
the rest of us. The task of writing an authoritative and considered economic
history of post-war Japan in English has yet to be accomplished.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Collor comes down to earth
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the dignitaries leave Rio de Janeiro this weekend after their
deliberations on saving the earth, their host should return to more mundane
matters of state: persuading a recalcitrant Congress to move on economic
reform.
President Fernando Collor's economic programme hangs in the balance. Success
on a variety of fronts is vital, the most significant being the passage into
law of a comprehensive tax reform proposal, which is vital for long-term
stability in government finances.
Fiscal consolidation is necessary to tame inflation, now running at around
20 per cent a month. Without that, the conditions for a resumption of growth
 -the only answer to the country's pressing social problems - will not
exist.
In April, the president gave himself a chance to break the political
deadlock that has so far hampered his administration's economic reform
efforts. His brother's recent allegations of corruption and drug abuse
against the president may regrettably have set this process back.
The group of politicians Mr Collor brought into his cabinet in April has
given the president the potential to deal more effectively with Congress,
where he has lacked support since he took office in 1990. In doing so,
however, he embraced traditional politicians for whom he expressed distaste
in his presidential campaign.
New-found supporters
There are worries that this accommodation of old-style politicians will be
accompanied by a return to old-style politics. The test of this will be
whether in coming months public funds are distributed to the regions where
the administration's new-found supporters are located, ahead of important
local elections in October. This would compromise the government's fiscal
policy.
However, the credibility of the policy should be enhanced by the
continuation in office of economy minister, Mr Marcilio Marques Moreira, and
his team. It has helped gradually to rebuild Brazil's damaged image with
foreign financial institutions, including international banks and the
International Monetary Fund, with which the government has a stand-by loan
programme.
Continued fiscal stringency is needed not least to maintain the support of
the IMF. Without it, a potential debt reduction accord now being discussed
with international banks would unravel. That accord is needed to bring a
boost in confidence which should help to lower domestic interest rates.
This, in turn, would reduce the crippling cost of Brazil's internal debt,
which feeds both the fiscal deficit and inflation.
Purse strings
The economic team held tightly to the purse strings in the first three
months of this year, allegedly compressing government expenditure by 60 per
cent in real terms from the same period last year. Even then, the government
failed to meet the targets set for the first quarter of its IMF programme.
The government says it is confident of meeting its half-year IMF targets.
Although revenues should now be rising as delayed corporate tax payments
start to flow, these are likely to be insufficient to avoid further drastic
expenditure compression, which is neither sustainable nor desirable for
long.
For a more permanent solution, congressional action is needed, first to
reform and simplify the tax system, also making clearer the divisions of
responsibility between federal and state governments, and second to reform
the 1988 constitution, which at present makes Brazil almost impossible to
govern. This would permit the necessary rationalisation of the state,
allowing the government to fire employees, for example.
By lowering tariffs and other measures, the Collor administration has,
despite early mistakes, begun to shake up Brazil's cosseted, inefficient and
state-dependent private sector. But progress is dependent on Mr Collor's
breaking the political stalemate.
If he fails to do that this year, his chances of doing so in the last two
years of his presidency will be remote. By then, the window that has opened
for a resolution of Brazil's external financial difficulties may well have
closed: the support of the IMF and what sympathy exists among international
banks will not be extended indefinitely.

We could be living through the end of television's golden age. Four

will be rare or non-existent.
Business Matters seeks to discover why the economies of Hong Kong and
Singapore, both founded by the British, have grown faster than Britain's

This Week (8.30 ITV) investigates legalised prostitution (not that it is
illegal now, of course, only soliciting or running a brothel). The Dutch

BBC2), which uses clips from feature films, cartoons and home movies to
explore the cultural impact of 20th century science. Today: the Russian

FT  11 JUN 92 / Arts: School of American Ballet - Dance in New York
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID VAUGHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The annual School of American Ballet Workshop (so-called) performances are
an event of more than parochial interest. They are, to begin with, fully
staged productions of ballets, usually from the repertory of New York City
Ballet, with orchestra, the excellent Juilliard School Philharmonia. (During
his tenure as musical director of the company, the late and much lamented
Robert Irving used to conduct.) The audience includes not only doting
parents and siblings, but also balletomanes, critics, and directors of other
companies from around the country, all on the lookout for new talent. Some
of these audience categories overlap.
Former members of NYCB now direct companies or teach outside the city. This
year's award-winning students, Emily Coates and Anna Liceica, are former
pupils of Patricia Wilde, director of Pittsburgh Ballet Theatre, and Yvonne
Mounsey, who teaches in Santa Monica, California, respectively. Another very
gifted young dancer, Rachel Rutherford, is the daughter of the former
ballerina Gage Bush and the late Richard Englund, an associate director of
the Joffrey Ballet. Coates and Liceica have already been taken into NYCB as
apprentices.
Although the School is the official school of City Ballet, not all its
graduates can find a place there, so it also feeds into American Ballet
Theatre and companies outside New York and even abroad. (Paloma Herrera, a
16-year old in last year's performances, has been attracting notice in small
roles at ABT this summer.)
The performances this year afforded a pleasure over and above that of
watching fresh young talent. After the dismal week of 'original' ballets
presented in the NYCB's 'Diamond Project' (which really was a glorified
workshop), it was a relief to see an evening of mostly great choreography:
two Balanchine ballets that were not in the company repertory this season,
Allegro brillante and Who Cares?, and a Bournonville divertissement, the pas
de trois from La Ventana. The only clinker was Martins's achingly tedious
Mozart Serenade.
The general level of the dancing would have done any professional company
proud. Once on stage, these teenagers seem to lose all trace of adolescent
insecurity and become assured, elegant, sophisticated young women and men.
If I had to pick out one outstanding dancer, it would be the Romanian-born
Anna Liceica, who danced the first variation in La Ventana with sweet
delicacy and lyricism, then gave a knockout performance of the 'My One and
Only' solo in Who Cares?, with its dazzling succession of multiple
pirouettes.
But the whole cast in this ballet was sensational, from corps de ballet
through to soloists: Liceica, Rutherford, bewitching in the 'Fascinatin'
Rhythm' solo, and Gavin Larsen, spirited in 'Stairway to Paradise', all
three women strongly partnered in their duets by John Winfield. As so often
before, this was the perfect ballet for a June evening in New York City.

FT  11 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Bank should explain documents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BARCLAYS BANK PLC v O'BRIEN
Court of Appeal
(Lord Justice Purchas,
Lord Justice Butler-Sloss
and Lord Justice Scott):
May 22 1992
A BANK seeking to procure a wife's signature as her husband's surety must
take reasonable steps to try and ensure that she understands the effect of
signing; and if it fails to take such steps it cannot enforce the security
against her on the grounds only that the husband, in deceiving her into
signing, was not acting as its agent.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by Mrs NE O'Brien from a
decision of Judge Marder QC that the plaintiff, Barclays Bank plc, was
entitled to enforce a mortgage document signed by her to secure her
husband's guarantee.
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT said Mr and Mrs O'Brien were married in 1963. Their
matrimonial home was in Slough. They purchased it with a Pounds 25,000
mortgage.
Mr O'Brien had an interest in a company called Heathrow Fabrications and was
its auditor. The manager of the Slough branch of Barclays Bank was Mr Roger
Tucker. In February 1987 he was transferred to Woolwich. The company's
account was transferred to Woolwich to be supervised by Mr Tucker.
The company had an overdraft which, in April 1987, was agreed at Pounds
60,000. By June 15 it had risen to over Pounds 98,000. Cheques were being
bounced.
On June 22 it was agreed between Mr Tucker and Mr O'Brien that the company
would be allowed a facility of Pounds 135,000 reducing to Pounds 120,000
after three weeks, guaranteed by Mr O'Brien. His liability was to be secured
by a second charge over the house.
Mr Tucker gave instructions for the necessary security documents to be
prepared. He sent them to the Burnham branch (a sub-branch of Slough) to
await signature by Mr and Mrs O'Brien.
He instructed the sub-branch to advise Mr and Mrs O'Brien that the maximum
facilities would be Pounds 135,000, to ensure that they were fully aware of
the nature of the documentation, and to advise that if in doubt they should
contact their solicitors before signing.
Mr O'Brien signed on July 1. On July 2 he brought his wife to the
sub-branch. The clerk failed to follow Mr Tucker's instructions. Mrs O'Brien
signed. The clerk witnessed her signature. No explanation of the documents
or their effect was given. She did not read the documents before signing. No
one recommended that she should obtain legal advice.
By October the indebtedness was over Pounds 154,000 and in November formal
demand was served on Mr O'Brien under the guarantee.
Mr O'Brien's liability was established by Judge Marder's judgment in the
court below. He did not appeal.
Mrs O'Brien did not fit the now rather outmoded pattern of down-trodden wife
subservient to her husband.
The judge said Mr O'Brien falsely represented to her that the charge was
limited to secure Pounds 60,000 and would be released in a short time.
Her evidence was that she was reluctant to put the family home at risk, but
her husband insisted that she must sign. He told her it was only for three
weeks. He became extremely emotional and said that if she did not sign the
whole company would go bankrupt and their son would lose his home as well.
Mrs O'Brien was concerned for her son and felt that, if it was only for
three weeks and would do the trick, she would sign. She went to the bank
where the documents were laid out for signing. She did not read them. They
had been folded back to show the places to be signed.
The principal reason the judge found in favour of the bank against Mrs
O'Brien was that there was no evidence that in deceiving his wife Mr O'Brien
was acting on behalf of the bank.
For historical reasons equity in the past treated married women differently
and more tenderly than other third parties who provided security for the
debts of others.
The authorities preceding Avon Finance v Bridger (1985) 2 AllER 281 did not
depend on endowing the husband with the status of creditor's agent. Married
women who provided security for their husbands' debts were treated as a
special protected class of surety.
Avon added to the protected class a case in which vulnerable elderly parents
had agreed to provide security for the debts of their adult son.
Post-Avon cases were not easy to reconcile with one another. In neither
Kings North Trust (1986) 1 WLR 119 nor Barclays Bank v Kennedy (FT, November
15, 1988) was there any explicit finding that the debtor was acting as agent
for the creditor.
In cases falling within the protected class, security given by the surety
would in certain circumstances be unenforceable notwithstanding that the
creditor might have no knowledge of and not have been responsible for the
vitiating feature of the transaction. That was supported by Turnbull v Duval
(1902) AC 329; Chaplin v Brammall (1908) 1 KB 233; Avon Finance; Kings North
Trust and Barclays Bank v Kennedy.
In cases falling within the protected class equity would hold the security
given by the surety to be unenforceable by the creditor if:
(1) the relationship between the debtor and the surety and the consequent
likelihood of influence and reliance was known to the creditor;
(2) the surety's consent to the transaction was procured by undue influence
or material misrepresentation on the debtor's part, and the surety lacked
adequate understanding of the nature and effect of the transaction;
(3) the creditor failed to take reasonable steps to try and ensure that the
surety entered into the transaction with adequate understanding of its
nature and effect and that the surety's consent was true and informed.
Those requirements emerged from the authorities.
The position of married women today was very different from what it was when
the equitable principles underlying Turnbull v Duval and Chaplin v Brammall
were being formulated. It was arguable that married women no longer needed
protection. Many women did not.
But in the culturally and ethnically mixed community in which we now lived,
the degree of emancipation for women was uneven.
Reliance by a wife on her husband to make the business decisions for the
family was the justification for the tenderness of equity towards married
women. That justification was still present. The old authorities pre-Avon
Finance v Bridger were still good law.
Each case within the protected class must depend on its own facts.
But a clear written recommendation to the surety to take independent advice
before signing would be advisable in most cases.
If a creditor had taken reasonable steps, such as advising the surety to
take independent advice or offering a fair explanation of the document
before the surety signed it, there was no reason why equity should
intervene.
The judge rightly declined to find Mr O'Brien had been appointed the bank's
agent. Mr Tucker's instructions to the sub-branch made it clear that the
bank was retaining the responsibility of explaining to Mrs O'Brien the
effect and nature of the documents she was to sign.
The question was whether the bank took reasonable steps to try and ensure
that she had an adequate comprehension of the effect of the charge.
It did not.
If Mr Tucker's instructions to the sub-branch had been carried out the
answer would have been otherwise.
Mr O'Brien was not the bank's agent, but the equitable principles
established in the authorities required that creditors who took from married
women security for their husbands' debts should take reasonable steps to see
that they understood the transactions they were entering into.
In view of Mrs O'Brien's misunderstanding of the transaction, it was not
enforceable against her, save to the extent of Pounds 60,000.
The appeal was allowed.
Lord Justice Butler-Sloss agreed. Lord Justice Purchas gave a concurring
judgment.
For Mrs O'Brien: Simon Buckhaven (Stops &amp; Burton, Daventry).
For the bank: Philip Goodenday (Harry I Alkin &amp; Co).

Howell Harris Hughes, the last of the outgoing members of the Prime
Minister's Downing Street policy unit, has resurfaced as deputy chairman
designate of Cantrade Investment Management.
Hughes, a former partner of Phillips &amp; Drew, was recruited to the policy
unit at the start of 1989 by Professor (now Lord) Brian Griffiths. He was
involved primarily on Department of Trade and Industry issues and his
responsibilities have now been passed on to David Poole, the James Capel
director who joined the policy unit last month.
By joining Cantrade Investment Management, the newly-formed investment arm
of Switzerland's Bank Cantrade, 48-year-old Hughes is returning to his old
stamping ground of non-pension fund investment management. He joined P &amp; D
in 1967 and rose to head the part of the business which specialised in
non-pension fund business. P &amp; D is now part of the Union Bank of
Switzerland empire as is Bank Cantrade. Cantrade Investment Management,
formed around the basis of the old CS Investment Management, has Pounds
1.3bn of funds under management and services a different part of the market
from the much bigger Phillips &amp; Drew Fund Management.
Hughes' appointment means that all the old members of the policy unit have
now found new jobs. Jonathan Hill, who worked for Jacob Rothschild and
Hamish Hamilton before joining the policy unit, replaced Judith Chaplin as
the Prime Minister's political secretary in March. Civil servant John Mills
has been appointed the new director of consumer affairs at the Office of
Fair Trading, and Caroline Sinclair, a former Treasury official, has moved
to the Home Office.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Malcolm Hawe, architect of Amec's rapid expansion into housebuilding and the
company's biggest individual shareholder, has resigned as chairman of the
company's loss-making housing and property business.
The departure of 53-year-old Hawe comes a couple of months after Amec itself
reported a loss as a result of a need to take a Pounds 60m exceptional
provision against its land and property values. In common with many
construction companies Amec, had increased its exposure to property and
housebuilding just at the wrong time. Analysts suggested that his departure
confirms that Amec intends to withdraw from the housing business.
Hawe, a quantity surveyor, joined Amec in 1986 when the group joined forces
with his housebuilding company to form Fairclough Homes. In 1989 he was
appointed to the main board following the 'remarkably successful
development' of Fairclough Homes. In addition to being rewarded with a
boardroom seat, Hawe also emerged as a major shareholder because Amec issued
paper to buy his company. At one stage he owned 6.85m Amec shares. However,
he has been a steady seller of Amec stock and according to the last annual
report his stake had fallen to 2m.
John Early, Amec's 46-year-old finance director, is taking over Hawe's
responsibilities and will continue to be responsible for directing Amec's
strategic development throughout Europe and for overseeing the
rationalisation of Amec's US activities. Simon Batey, Early's 39-year-old
deputy, is taking over from Early as group finance director.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Ernest Harrison, chairman and chief executive of Racal Electronics for
26 years, will relinquish the chief executive spot to his right-hand man
David Elsbury from the beginning of August.
While Elsbury, 56, was obviously the heir apparent, analysts yesterday
expressed a degree of surprise that Sir Ernest had lined himself up as
chairman of Chubb, the security locks and alarms business due to be demerged
in October. The precise timing of the split chairman and chief executive
role at Racal may thus have been determined by Sir Ernest's appreciation he
could not inhabit all three positions - with the chairmanship of Vodafone,
now spun off from Racal, into the bargain.
Elsbury, who joined Racal in 1956, has been chief operating officer since
1989, and deputy chief executive since 1983. His task in the last three
years has been to restructure the non-Vodafone side of the business.
Sir Ernest, 66, yesterday also named the two non-executive directors he is
bringing onto the Chubb board. One is Sir Colin Corness, chairman of Redland
and the Nationwide building society and a director of the Bank of England.
Sir Colin knows Chubb already, having been a non-executive director of Chubb
&amp; Sons for ten years until the Racal purchase in 1984.
Meanwhile, the other non-executive appointment, Michael Blackburn, who was
until last April chairman of Touche Ross &amp; Co., has obviously forgiven the
chairman his rhetoric in the midst of the recent Williams Holdings battle
for Racal. Sir Ernest, a qualified accountant himself, was heard to make
disparaging remarks about the profession as he laid into the Williams team -
a bunch of 'accountants' who only knew how to slash costs.
*****
David Downes becomes deputy chief executive of HUNTER SAPHIR in addition to
his responsibilities as group finance director. Peter Austin becomes a

Management changes continue apace at Royal Insurance, as the composite
insurer claws its way back to profitability under chief executive Richard
Gamble.
Peter Sharman is the latest to move upwards as part of a rejigging of senior
posts at Royal UK, which sees the departure of managing director Geoff
Prince.
Sharman, a 48-year-old Lancastrian, has been with Royal since 1961. One of
the company's 'troubleshooters', he has headed up problem-prone subsidiaries
in Spain and Australasia. He was called back from Australia last August to
become Prince's deputy.
Prince, 51 and another Royal stalwart, had only been managing director for
just over two years ago. He will now pursue a new career outside insurance,
leaving as the company's UK underwriting results show the first signs of
improvement after two years of heavy losses.
Meanwhile, Roy Elms, the underwriting director appointed late last year,
sees his responsibilities broadened. He becomes deputy chairman of both
Royal UK and Royal Insurance (Global), the subsidiary which underwrites
multinational and London market business.
Royal's chairman, Sir John Cuckney, has been appointed chairman of Royal
Insurance (Global).
Separately, at Royal Life Estates, James Chapman has been appointed
financial services director. Phillip Raw takes over as professional services
director and Bill Willetts becomes human resources and general services
director.

Dealers and managers in financial markets are calling on a host of novel and
sophisticated mathematical methods in their never-ending search for ways to
improve trading performance.
The new techniques have emerged from research into artificial intelligence;
the way in which they work is reminiscent not only of the mechanisms of the
mind but of natural inheritance.
They include such esoteric developments as neural networks, rule induction
and genetic algorithms. These are being applied to a range of market
analyses including stock market prediction, currency rate prediction,
portfolio management and credit evaluation.
According to Philip Treleaven and Suran Goonatilake* of the Department of
Computer Science at University College, London, the new methods are already
showing an edge over traditional statistical methods. A technique based on
chaos theory, for example, was found to be up to 50 times more effective
than traditional modelling techniques at forecasting market movements such
as the Dow Jones average or the price of IBM stock. They suggest that the
next generation of intelligent financial technologies will involve a
combination of two or more methods to create hybrid systems - one to analyse
and predict market movements, for example, and one to execute trades
according to predetermined rules.
Inevitably, the growth of intelligent financial technologies will mean more
automation in an area where human judgment and skill has been considered
paramount. 'It may be possible that these technologies will lead to a
situation where future investment houses have large numbers of extremely
adaptive, intelligent machine traders to perform many of the more mundane
trading tasks,' warn the authors.
It is easy to get carried away, however, with the idea of the world's
financial markets controlled by armies of robot traders. The only things the
new techniques really do is to spot trends and recognise patterns - but
rather more efficiently than the conventional mathematical methods of
statistical clustering and regression analysis which have been the mainstays
to date.
These techniques are based on approaches which seem positively bizarre to
those outside the rarefied atmosphere of advanced mathematics. Genetic
algorithms, for example, have their origin in a species of Darwinism - a
sort of survival of the fittest theory. They have been successfully used to
solve problems in imaging, large-scale electronic circuit layout, gas
pipeline control and job shop scheduling.
The starting point is a pool of possible solutions to the problem, randomly
chosen. These solutions are then coded in a form a computer can understand -
as a set of binary digits or conventional numbers. The sets of digits are
analo-gous to chromosomes, and the digits analogous to individual genes. A
program simulating evolution in action  - genetic combination, mutation and
so on - can be applied to the 'chromosomes'. The aim to is produce a
'better' solution, just as Darwinian evolution is reckoned to produce
species better fitted to survive. Because there is no 'natural selection' of
an improved solution from the genetic algorithm, at each turn of the cycle,
the products must be evaluated to test how good they are at solving the
problem.
It seems hardly credible but, in practice, it seems to work. In an
artificial stock market at the Santa Fe Institute, robot traders using
genetic algorithm techniques generated rules about when to buy - such as
'when the price earnings multiple is low' - and price trend continuations.
This after about a day's run on a workstation.
Human traders need not fear for their jobs just yet; but they should be
aware that survival of the fittest does not only apply to nature.

Communities, 1992

FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Hint on company tax rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government raised the prospect of a reduction in the rate of corporation
tax to 20 per cent for small companies yesterday, following its policy of
aligning the levy with the standard rate of income tax, David Owen writes.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said such a move
might be possible, under questioning from Mr Chris Smith, a Labour
frontbench Treasury spokesman.
Mr Smith had asked for an indication of the government's future plans on
corporation tax, since it appeared to be its intention to expand the 20p
income tax band introduced in the last budget until it became effectively
the standard rate.
Mr Dorrell said the small-companies rate of 25 per cent reflected the
importance the government attached to ensuring a low marginal rate of tax
for wealth creation.
Mr Smith also used yesterday's Commons debate on the corporate tax-related
clauses of this year's finance bill to attack the government for its
'appalling' manufacturing investment record.
Proposing an amendment to lift first-year capital allowances to 40 per cent
from 25 per cent, he said the Tories had 'neglected and denigrated the
importance of manufacturing for far too long'.
The amendment was defeated with a government majority of 108 (339-231).

FT  11 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine shrugs off Opposition
ambush
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL HESELTINE emerged virtually unscathed from a political ambush by
Labour MPs when he made his first appearance in the Commons yesterday to
answer questions about his new responsibilities as president of the board of
trade.
The Opposition contrasted his low profile since the general election with
the challenging speeches on economic and industrial policy that captured the
headlines during the period when he was seeking to replace Mrs Margaret
Thatcher as leader of the Conservative party.
Highlighting the views expressed by Mr Heseltine at that time, Mr Gordon
Brown, shadow trade and industry secretary, asked what had happened to such
ideas as tax credits to encourage research, a levy to finance training, and
the reshaping of regional policy and export services.
To Labour cheers, Mr Brown demanded: 'Why is action man failing to act? Have
you exchanged your principles for your presidency?'
In dismissive tones, Mr Heseltine said he had just exchanged the Department
of the Environment - his first post on returning to the cabinet - for the
Department of Trade and Industry.
He said the ideas favoured by Mr Brown were the basis for discussion during
the general election, and added: 'Having failed to persuade the country, it
is extremely unlikely that you will be able to persuade the House of
Commons.'
Mr Heseltine told another Labour critic that he would offer no excuses for
the present situation.
He said: 'I would merely explain that this country has to fight its way out
of one of the worst recessions since the war.'
To succeed, Britain had to 'excel in the increasingly competitive world
which we face'.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Bar urged to clarify complaint procedure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BAR'S procedures for handling complaints against barristers were
criticised yesterday by the Legal Services Ombudsman for lack of
transparency.
In his first annual report, Mr Michael Barnes said the Bar's procedures were
primarily disciplinary and often left complainants feeling they had become
minor players in the profession's internal disciplinary proceedings rather
than protagonists of their own complaints.
The Bar's professional conduct committee, which dealt with most complaints
against barristers, offered no possibility of compensation.
A recurrent cause of complaint was the Bar's failure to notify the
complainant of the barrister's response to the complaint, or why a complaint
had been dismissed or, in those cases where action had been taken against
the barrister, what the outcome was.
That had prompted him to recommend last October that the Bar should inform
complainants of the response of the barrister. The Bar has indicated that it
accepts the recommendation in principle.
Mr Barnes said that following a number of complaints from beneficiaries of
wills about solicitors' charges for administration of estates, he had called
on the Law Society to give beneficiaries the power to challenge solicitors'
costs.
In one case, a firm of solicitors took nearly 10 years to administer an
estate worth almost Pounds 1m. After solicitors' fees of Pounds 192,494,
auditors' fees of Pounds 180,345 and a Pounds 105,000 penalty for late
payment of capital transfer tax, just Pounds 450,000 was left.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Criticisms of Cadbury report emerge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERNS about the recommendations of the Cadbury Committee's report on
corporate governance emerged yesterday in a survey published at a conference
sponsored by the Confederation of British Industry. The report was widely
hailed by the government and industry when it was published last month.
The heart of it was a voluntary code of practice for company directors,
accountants and auditors. Managements would have to defer more decisions to
non-executive directors and give shareholders more information.
Yesterday's conference in London heard that a survey of fund managers and
auditors by Burson-Marsteller, the public-relations company, found that a
majority of both groups felt the recommendations did not go far enough.
Most of the 22 leading fund managers and auditors interviewed felt that the
committee had been unwilling to produce a report that upset corporate
directors. One fund manager was quoted as saying: 'There are some things
they were not able to come out about as they would have liked.'
In particular, most shareholders doubted whether the voluntary nature of the
code would be effective. The survey found that the question of enforcement
was the most troubling to all respondents and the one that most divided
them. One fund manager was quoted as saying that while a voluntary approach
should be the initial one, 'if it becomes clear there isn't compliance, then
there should be legislation'.
The proposed means of enforcing compliance with the code is that to qualify
for a new Stock Exchange listing, companies will have to disclose the extent
to which they comply with the code, and where they do not, explain why.
Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, Stock Exchange chairman and a member of the Cadbury
Committee, speaking at the conference, defended that as an effective
enforcement mechanism. He said shareholders would be encouraged to take
managements to task for poor board structures, forcing companies to comply.
The survey found some institutional shareholder scepticism about that
approach. One shareholder said: 'There is no way of effective enforcement
other than delisting at the Stock Exchange. That would be like using a
nuclear weapon - in other words, it will never be used.'
Institutions are concerned that companies may not comply fully or accurately
with the new disclosure requirement and doubt whether the exchange would be
willing to put its full force behind enforcement, according to the survey.
Shareholders also said they wanted the committee's recommendations to
include that a company's lead bank be represented on its board in a
non-executive capacity. They also wanted recommendations that directors be
vetted prior to appointment, that there be still greater clarification of
the duties and responsibilities of directors, and that directors' service
contracts be no longer than three to six months.
Directors ousted for poor performance often leave with large redundancy
payments stemming from the company's obligation to pay them for the term of
their service contract. Company law allows directors to be appointed for up
to five years - longer if shareholders agree. The Cadbury Committee urges
that that be cut to three years - a period still too long for most fund
managers.
The survey quotes one fund manager as complaining that three years is too
long because 'there have been so many deadbeats kicked out of British
industry and taking huge cash handouts because of the service contracts and
it is one of the worst aspects of the way that companies are run'.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Scots bank bows out of refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR executives of Mirror Group Newspapers have been told that the Bank of
Scotland has decided not to go ahead with providing Pounds 30m towards a
refinancing package.
The Bank of Scotland has been bankers to the Glasgow-based Scottish Daily
Record and Sunday Mail for nearly a century.
It is understood that the Scottish Daily Record may now consider moving its
account to another bank.
The Bank of Scotland is one of a consortium of banks negotiating a
medium-term financial package to provide MGN with greater stability while
decisions over its ultimate ownership and future are taken. The package is
believed to involve a facility of Pounds 250m for two years.
It is particularly important for the Record because new colour presses are
already in Glasgow but the company does not have the money to install them.
MGN was told that the reason for the Bank of Scotland's decision was
'financial prudence'. The Bank of Scotland said last night: 'The bank has
not withdrawn from the consortium, nor has it reduced the limits (of the
Scottish Daily Record).'
National Westminster, the senior consortium bank, has been reallocating the
Pounds 30m among other member banks and it is believed that most of it has
been placed.
The refinancing of MGN is not thought to have been jeopardised as a result.
The company is expected to go ahead with the publication of its accounts
later this month. It will be followed soon after by a relisting of its
shares.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Boundaries of assisted areas are to be reviewed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOUNDARIES of assisted areas are to be reviewed, prompting warnings that
the move may lead to a reduction in government financial assistance to the
regions.
A consultation paper, accompanying the announcement by Mr Tim Sainsbury, the
industry minister, said: 'It is unlikely that the coverage of the new map
will be greater than now, and it could be somewhat less.'
Specialists in regional policy noted yesterday that government financial
assistance had been steadily declining. They warned that a review of the
boundaries of assisted areas was likely to accentuate that trend.
The assisted areas map defines the geographical areas where, under regional
policy, industrial incentives can be paid to companies. There are two sorts
of assisted areas - development and intermediate - denoting the extent of
subsidies that can be paid. Such financial assistance cost Pounds 642.6m in
the 1986-87 financial year, but had declined to Pounds 264.4m by 1991-92.
During the 1980s, automatic entitlements to regional aid were phased out,
and subsidies have become discretionary on a project-by-project basis.
Assisted areas cover 35 per cent of the UK working population and, except
for parts of Cornwall and Devon, are concentrated north of a line drawn from
the Severn to the Wash. In its review of the areas to be included on a new
map, the government will take into account factors such as un-employment and
future economic performance.
Mr Keith Hayton, senior lecturer at Strathclyde University's centre for
planning, suggested that 'the core assisted areas' such as parts of
Scotland, north-east England, the Welsh valleys and the western tip of
Cornwall would remain on the map.
The government promised a review of the map during the present session of
parliament as far back as 1988, and European Community competition rules
mean that any changes will have to be negotiated with Brussels. The new map
should be published early next year.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Stoy and Finnie to merge: Accountancy firm will be 10th
largest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOY HAYWARD, the UK's 11th-largest accountancy firm by fee income, is to
merge with Finnie &amp; Co, the 20th-largest.
The new firm - to be called Stoy Hayward - will have 176 partners and
directors, 1,300 professional staff and an annual fee income of more than
Pounds 82m, making it the 10th-largest firm under present rankings.
Mr Adrian Martin, managing partner at Stoy Hayward, said the merger was
agreed for strategic reasons and did not reflect any financial weaknesses in
either firm.
He said Stoy Hayward had been considering ways to strengthen its network in
the south-east since the mid 1980s as part of its expansion of its London
office. No professional staff and only a handful of support staff would lose
their jobs as a result, he said.
Mr Geoff Warren, senior partner of Finnie, will become the seventh member of
Stoy's management executive, and four of Finnie's partners will join the
seven Stoy partners on its partnership council, which sets general
principles for the firm.
He said Finnie's partners decided to begin looking for a merger partner late
last summer to strengthen the firm's presence outside the south-east and to
provide additional expertise in some practice areas.
Stoy Hayward was the only firm in which he was seriously interested, he
added.
Finnie's nine existing offices in the south-east will become Stoy Hayward
offices, 'in association with Finnie &amp; Co', while its central London head
office will move into Stoy's headquarters. Only its small branch in
Beverley, Humberside, will remain an independent firm.
No money will change hands as part of the deal, and negotiations over the
last few months have centred on how to structure profit-sharing between the
two sets of partners.
Profit-sharing will continue to reflect the different contributions of the
two firms until a new partnership remuneration agreement is redrafted in two
years.
Accountancy firms will be forbidden to audit the accounts of any companies
for which they have valued brands, pension funds, property and other assets,
under draft rules released yesterday by their professional bodies.
The change was widely welcomed in submissions from accountancy firms and
other bodies received in advance of the guidelines, issued by the chartered
accountants joint ethics committee, which represents the three institutes of
chartered accountants - in England and Wales, in Scotland and in Ireland.
They state that a firm should not audit any material specialist valuations
performed by the same firm or an associated practice, where the valuation
would be incorporated into the accounts as either the firm's or the
directors' valuation.
Among firms likely to be affected is Coopers &amp; Lybrand, which conducted
brand valuation for companies including Mirror Group Newspapers while acting
as auditors.
Another draft guideline issued yesterday states that firms should refuse to
give a second opinion on contentious accounting issues to a company audited
by another firm, unless they are in full possession of the information on
the subject held by the auditor.
The guidelines follow identification by the ethics committee of a number of
instances of 'opinion shopping', by which companies have undermined the
authority of their auditors by going elsewhere for a more sympathetic
ruling.

<TEXT>
TWO OF the bids to take over British International Helicopters Ltd (BIHL),
Robert Maxwell's helicopter company now in administration, were yesterday
referred to the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, Daniel Green writes.
Arthur Andersen, administrators of Maxwell's private companies, said the
decision would 'add to the uncertainty surrounding BIHL's future'. The MMC
has until September 9 to make its ruling.
Aberdeen-based BIHL went into administration in December 1991. It employs
500 people and has 26 operational helicopters, worth up to Pounds 5m each.
The referred bids, by Bond Helicopters and Bristow Helicopters, both UK
companies, would if successful reduce from three to two the number of
competitors in the Pounds 200m-a-year North Sea helicopter services
business. If Bristow won control of BIHL's assets, it would have about 75
per cent of the market, while if Bond won it would have nearly half.
It is understood that both the Office of Fair Trading and oil companies
operating in the North Sea objected to the bids.

<TEXT>
THE International Labour Organisation yesterday issued an unusually stern
rebuke to Brazil for failure to implement laws against forced labour, AP
reports from Geneva.
A special ILO committee urged the Brazilian government to step up its
efforts 'to end the existence of appalling labour conditions', cited in a
damning report on the extent of what is often near-slavery.
The report said thousands of men, women and young children were forced to
work in mines and on the land in Brazil, facing punishment and even death if
they try to escape.
The ILO's Committee on the Application of Standards said it recognised the
problems in enforcing labour laws in remote parts of the country, but said
the government should do more to stop the violations and punish the guilty.
Officials said the use of the word 'appalling' in the committee's
conclusions was exceptionally strong.
Mr Ken Thomas, trade union spokesman on the committee, described the
situation in Brazil as an 'international disgrace.'
The report detailed allegations that Brazilians hired to work arrive at
their destination, often thousands of miles from home, to find they have
been charged for transportation and that the wages are lower than promised.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Victor Polay Campos, leader of Peru's second-largest guerrilla group, has
been captured in a Lima suburb. His arrest is a much-needed boost for the
anti-terrorist police and a relief for the government, which this week
introduced a night-time traffic curfew in the capital following stepped-up
terrorist activity.
Mr Polay is head of the Tupac Amaru Revolutionary Movement (MRTA ), a
pro-Cuban group which has operated in Peru since the mid-1980s. It has
periodically vied with the hard-line Maoist Sendero Luminoso (Shining Path)
for domination of areas of Peru's coca-rich northern jungle. The group was
particularly active in Lima during the Gulf war, attacking US-affiliated
installations and businesses.
MRTA activity has fallen in the past few years. This further blow to the
organisation will please Peruvian businessmen; it financed its well-equipped
forces through kidnap and extortion rackets in which thousands of legitimate
businesses paid 'quotas' to support the revolution.
Less ruthless than Sendero, the MRTA has nevertheless been responsible for
hundreds of deaths and millions of dollars' worth of damage in bomb attacks.
Mr Polay was first captured in 1989 but, in July 1990, he escaped from a
high-security prison, with 47 other MRTA prisoners. He was formerly a friend
and party colleague of ex-President Alan Garca.

<TEXT>
OFFICIALS at the Earth Summit were last night struggling to put together
agreements acceptable to heads of state who arrive in Rio de Janeiro today.
Last-minute negotiations were under way in an effort to complete agreements
on a declaration to conserve the world's forests, and financial arrangements
to implement the Earth Summit's decisions.
Major compromises seemed likely in both these areas where deep divisions
remain between developed and developing countries. Officials said these
deals would have to be struck by ministers, with the summit likely to end
with a long bargaining session.
Mr Michael Young, a US State Department official said: 'The goal is to
complete everything by tonight. That goal is in sight.'
Despite talks until 4am yesterday, officials were unable to agree a
financial package to help Third World countries deal with their
environmental problems. The main issues are the terms on which industrial
countries should commit themselves to raising their aid budgets to 0.7 per
cent of GNP, the replenishment of the International Development Association
(IDA) through which the World Bank helps the poorest countries, and
conditions for loans from the Global Environment Facility (GEF), a fund
jointly administered by the UN and the World Bank.
Mr Jamshed Marker, the Pakistani official who chairs the Group of 77 Third
World countries, said the G77 had accepted the new draft, with the exception
of three points which would have to go to ministers.
Among the industrial countries, Japan, which has hinted that it is preparing
a big financial package for the summit, has taken a tough line on refusing
to commit itself to a timetable for the 0.7 per cent target, and has been
insisting on GEF conditions.
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, will announce to the summit how
much the UK will contribute, said a UK official.
Disagreements over forests centre on how far countries' sovereign rights
extend, certain trade issues, and whether a treaty on forest conservation
should be attempted.

The privatisation bill was before the legislature for two years.
The launch of the programme follows a decision of the Bolivian supreme court
that privatising state enterprises, some of which have been in state hands
since nationalisation after the 1952 revolution, was constitutional.
The confederation of Bolivian trade unions is threatening widespread
industrial action in a bid to halt the process.
Mr Doria said several privatisation mechanisms would be used, including
employee share offers, asset sales, leasing, private capital investments and
share offers on Bolivia's small stock exchange.
The minister added: 'The state does not have the resources to invest in
these companies. The only criteria which will determine their sale will be
price. Mechanisms will be put in place to avoid doubtful practices and
corruption.'
The government has shrunk from privatising the country's most attractive
assets, which are in its natural resources of metals and oil. Privatising
these sectors remains unconstitutional and the government has opted for
joint-venture exploration and exploitation.
The first Bolivian enterprise to go under the hammer is an edible-oil
factory at Rafael Deheza, now operating at 6 per cent capacity and losing
money. Mr Doria believes the plant could be turned around with an investment
of less than Dollars 1m.
The government acknowledges that many of the 60 or so enterprises for sale
are already closed for want of adequate investment; others are functioning
at far below maximum productive capacity.
Despite the modest expected revenues, the privatisations are seen as having
symbolic importance, as a start in the attempt to diminish the size of the
state sector while convincing Bolivia's foreign creditors that the
government is firmly wedded to a liberal economic policy.

<TEXT>
REV Pat Robertson, the television evangelist who once had presidential
ambitions, will not proceed with his Dollars 6m (Pounds 3.2m) takeover of
United Press International, the loss-ridden news agency.
He told a Washington news conference yesterday that a review of UPI's
finances and operations had shown that 'its economics just don't seem to
make sense'. He said he might submit a bid for one or two of the company's
assets, including possibly its name, later in the day.
Mr Robertson, who runs the Christian Broadcasting Network, emerged as the
only bidder for all of UPI at a bankruptcy hearing last month. He was given
30 days to inspect its books, during which time he has been paying the 500
staff still working at the agency.
Advisers had told him he would have to spend about Dollars 31m on UPI over
the next 18 months to make the news agency notionally viable, but with no
guarantee of commercial success. He noted wryly that his own broadcasting
company had recently dropped UPI's service in favour of Associated Press.
There had been speculation that Mr Robertson might use UPI as a vehicle for
proselytising his fundamentalist beliefs, a prospect which alarmed Kyodo,
the Japanese news wire service and the agency's largest remaining client.

EIGHT HUNDRED employees and only 100 customers yesterday attended the grand
opening of Japan's largest department store.
Conceived at the height of the 1980s economic boom, the Tobu company's
Y100bn (Pounds 429m) steel and glass palace opened its doors amid the
steepest fall in consumer spending since the 1960s.
Cheer leaders and a brass band were on hand as white-gloved Tobu directors,
led by the company president, simultaneously cut the red-and-white tape.
April department store sales fell 2 per cent from a year ago, after a 4.1
per cent drop in March, the worst fall since 1965. Some economists predict
no upturn in consumer spending until spring next year.
Moreover, department stores, already hit by a sharp fall in sales of luxury
items, are finding customers are switching from high-margin goods with
famous labels to non-branded products which offer retailers smaller profits.
Tobu certainly expected to see more customers on the first day - 90
policemen and 95 security guards were on duty during the ceremony yesterday
morning. A man in his early twenties, at the head of the queue at the main
entrance, said he had arrived two hours before the 9 am ceremony to be in
front of the crowds. In the event, he need hardly have bothered.
Tobu expects to cover investment costs of the new store in five years. For
the year to next June, it expects sales of the new Ikebukuro store to total
Y180bn. However, most customers browsing through the store yesterday failed
to contribute to revenues. A middle-aged woman who walked around the store
finally left with a bag of croissants.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S ruling Golkar party has retained power with a slightly reduced
majority from Tuesday's parliamentary election, with provisional figures
indicating that its support has fallen 6 per cent from the 1987 result.
Golkar has captured 67 per cent of the 91m votes counted so far, compared to
the 73 per cent it won five years ago. About 107m people were eligible to
vote and the turnout was expected to be more than 90 per cent.
The United Development Party (PPP), a loose coalition of Moslem groups, has
taken 17.5 per cent of the vote, up from the 16 per cent in 1987. The
nationalist Indonesian Democratic Party (PDI) benefited most from reduced
Golkar support, increasing its vote from 11 per cent to just over 15 per
cent.
Golkar's clean victory in an election free of violence has been welcomed by
Jakarta's financial community. One foreign broker noted that 'the market was
especially strong, a clear sign of foreign investor confidence'.
With Golkar enjoying almost the total support of the country's 4m civil
servants and much of the business community, the election was destined to be
a one-sided contest.
Mr Rachmat Witoelar, secretary-general of Golkar, admitted: 'There is a
distinct advantage of having cadres who are well-off', although he denied
that Golkar has spent Rp90bn (Pounds 24m) on the campaign.
Golkar won in all of Indonesia's 27 provinces, including the disputed
territory of East Timor.

<TEXT>
THE Hong Kong government yesterday released figures showing that the
colony's proposed airport will be a 'very robust business' from its opening
in 1997, as discussions with China over the financing of the project are
elevated to prime ministerial level.
The airport's revenue is forecast to reach HKDollars 22.7bn (Pounds 1.6bn)
by 2010 - enough to provide operating profits of HKDollars 10.4bn after
recurrent capital expenditure and taxation, the government said.
Officials said the release of further financial information coincided with a
meeting between Mr John Major, Britain's prime minister, and Li Peng, his
Chinese counterpart, in Rio de Janeiro today.
Mr Major is expected to raise with Li China's procrastination about airport
financing. Hong Kong officials hope the two premiers can achieve a
breakthrough where diplomatic channels have failed.
Officials are concerned that China's failure to approve the financing for
the new airport may cause its already tight construction schedule to slip.
Li told Lord Wilson, the colony's retiring governor, earlier this week in
Beijing that China supported the new airport project and was keen to see it
built on time. However, discussions with the Chinese about the financing of
the airport and related projects are now in their third month.
A memorandum Britain and China signed last September specified talks should
take only one month. Hong Kong officials need China's assent to the plans
before they are put to the local legislature before it rises in late July.

FT  11 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Gatt plea to west on Bangladesh exports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   GENEVA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS BY Bangladesh to liberalise its trade regime and boost exports are
being handicapped by trade barriers in rich western countries, the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) says in a review of the country's
trade policies.
Discussing the report yesterday, Gatt's governing council called for
improved access to foreign markets for Bangladesh's exports, reinforced by
'adequate financial and technical assistance', to support continued trade
reform.
The report notes that non-traditional exports such as clothing and frozen
fish have grown rapidly since the early 1980s while traditional exports such
as jute, leather and tea have stagnated. But Bangladesh's export base
remains narrow with these five areas accounting for over 90 per cent of
export. Moreover, clothing exports to the west are now subject to quota
restrictions under the Multi-Fibre Arrangement and other bilateral
arrangements, and other exports face a variety of tariff and non-tariff
barriers.
The Bangladesh government has been particularly stung by a US decision to
impose anti-dumping duties of up to 42 per cent on shop towels from
Bangladesh. In 1990 these imports, which are used for wiping machine parts,
amounted to a princely Dollars 2.46m.
With few natural resources and a tiny industrial sector, Bangladesh's export
income covers only 40 per cent of import needs, leaving 60 per cent to be
financed by overseas aid. Its 108m people have an average income of less
than Dollars 200 a year, making Bangladesh one of the poorest of nations.
The Gatt report urges 'a more sympathetic external environment' to encourage
Bangladesh's export potential and underpin continued economic
liberalisation. 'The elimination of barriers in key export markets' would
help to reduce transitional unemployment and balance-of-payments problems,
it says.
Trade reforms begun in 1985 have had some success in reducing protection,
encouraging exports and improving economic efficiency, the report adds. But
Gatt is critical of the Bangladesh government for spending too much on
propping up uncompetitive loss-making companies in both the public and
private sectors.

FT  11 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Mexico faces hard choice in keeping oil
out of Nafta - In the first of a series on the North Atlantic free trade
area / A look at the effect of the proposed pact on the Mexican oil industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH Cuba, Argentina, and the ex-Soviet Union all opening up oil exploration
to foreign companies, Mexico's reform-minded government might be expected to
do the same. But wary of tackling Mexico's most potent nationalist symbol,
the government insists that the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta)
will not allow foreign exploration of Mexican oil, nor lead to the
privatisation of Petreleos Mexicanos (Pemex).
President Carlos Salinas at Pemex's recent 54th anniversary was clear
enough: 'The property of oil stays uniquely and firmly under the control of
the Mexican state'. Mexican trade negotiators have repeated this so often,
that there can be little doubt that risk, or wildcat, contracts will not be
permitted.
The US, sensitive to Mexican nationalist sentiment, has in any case stopped
short of demanding changes that would allow wild-catting.
The government has ordered Pemex to produce plans for radical reform
following the Guadalajara gas explosion in which more than 200 people died.
The company is likely to be broken up into subsidiary companies looking
after areas such as exploration, refining and gas sales, with the core
company operating as a giant contractor. While the government does not
intend to sell Pemex, at least in short term, the reform is likely to lead
Pemex to contract out much more work to foreign companies. Reform details
are likely within the next few days.
In the meantime, the US is eyeing other opportunities. The petrochemicals
industry is calling for direct investment in Mexico's basic petrochemicals;
the gas and oil companies want to sell gas and refined products to the
Mexican end-user; contract companies want to make it easier to sell Pemex
equipment, and to carry out drilling and other services. The US government
may also want a secure oil supply from Mexico guaranteed. Pemex has baulked
at such demands, but the Mexican government will concede most of them,
because they are consistent with plans to turn Pemex into a modern and lean
oil company, focused on production and exploration.
Plans to modernise Pemex pre-date the latest reform programme as well as
negotiations over Nafta. The government cut the number of petrochemicals
reserved to the state to 19 in 1989, and has made clear the number will be
cut further after Nafta is signed.
Likewise, Pemex has already decided to follow the path the big oil
independents took in the 1960s and contract out drilling work to specialist
companies. These turn-key projects, to be financed by a Dollars 1.3bn
(Pounds 710m) loan from the US Eximbank, do not break Mexico's constitution,
since the company's payment does not depend on the amount of oil found. The
first such project was awarded to Triton International last spring, which
drilled into the ocean in a record 127 days, half Pemex's normal time. Since
then, EPN Sonat, a joint venture between the US company Sonat and the
Mexican EPN Arval has won two contracts worth Dollars 100m to drill six
wells in the Bay of Campeche.
The turn-key projects will not attract the big US oil companies, who rarely
do drilling contract work, says Mr Ed Porter of the American Petroleum
Institute in Washington. Instead, the market will be left to the small
independent engineering and drilling companies. Nafta will make such
contracts easier for US and Canadian companies by cutting the paperwork,
middlemen, and preference Pemex has in the past shown to Mexican
contractors.
Perhaps, above all, says Mr Rafael Quijano, of the Petroleum Finance
Corporation in Washington, and a former Pemex employee, Nafta will 'create
an environment in which contract business can flourish'. But given that
total Pemex investment in exploration and production is Dollars 1.7bn this
year, the contract work might be worth at most Dollars 500m a year.
Many foreign oil companies still hope Mexico will relax regulations against
foreign equity investment, but some time after Nafta is signed. Even by the
most pessimistic estimates, Pemex has 30bn barrels of crude equivalent in
oil reserves, and thus a production reserve ratio of 21-1, double that in
the US.
Pemex's pressing economic problem is not in finding oil, which is what the
big oil independents can offer Mexico, but bringing it up to the ground.
That kind of work does not require risk contracts.
The US gas producers may have more luck than the big oil independents.
Imports of natural gas into Mexico have grown rapidly, because of greater
industrial development along the border, and environmental regulations
demanding more gas use.
Demand is expected to continue to rise, which would require substantial
investment in new gas pipelines. Mexico may let US companies build the
pipes, but this would require changing current regulatory law.
While Pemex may be unwilling to abandon its monopoly in energy exploration,
it desperately needs help in refining products; Pemex imported a record
Dollars 1.25bn of petroleum and petrochemical products last year. It intends
to build a new refinery in central Mexico soon, and expand production at
existing ones, at a cost, according to Petroleum Intelligence Weekly, of at
least Dollars 8bn. Pemex is looking for a foreign partner in building and
financing a refinery, although Pemex will operate the facility.
The trouble for Pemex is that little foreign interest has been shown in the
schemes Mexico has proposed. Engineering companies do not want to receive
payment in refined crude. Oil companies do not want Pemex to operate the
final facility, and would like to sell oil they have refined in the Mexican
market.
One foreign oil executive suggests that as Mexico's import bill for refined
products climbs, the government will open up refining and the sale of
refined products to foreign oil companies, some time after Nafta is signed.
The Guadalajara disaster, for which Pemex was blamed, is increasing the
pressure for change.
However, opening up exploration and production remain difficult, since the
property of oil would still remain 'firmly in the hands of the state'.

FT  11 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Brussels anger over US food export hitlist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday reacted angrily to the publication in
Washington of a Dollars 2bn EC food exports 'hit-list', half of which may
suffer punitive tariffs if the EC fails to reform its oilseeds subsidy
regime.
This latest escalation of the oilseeds row casts a pall over prospects of
concluding the Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation talks, in which the
US and EC can still not agree on how far each side should cut farm
subsidies.
The Dollars 2bn hit list, which ranges across wine, cheese, biscuits, gin,
liqueurs, tobacco, will be pared to Dollars 1bn after 30 days of being open
to public suggestions. It does not include whisky. This is a notional
estimate of damage caused by EC discrimination against the US's powerful
soyabean exporters. If imposed, the list would block about a quarter of EC
food exports to the US.
Brussels officials described the action as 'totally without justification
since it lacks any legal basis' within the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt) disputes procedures, now ostensibly being followed by both
sides. The EC has taken up a Gatt panel option to offer compensation to US
exporters while nevertheless challenging the Gatt ruling which it hopes
ultimately will be settled in the Uruguay Round.
Compensation would do nothing to answer US soya farmers' complaints.
'What is needed is fair access into the EC market so US soyabean farmers can
compete for the market. This can only be accomplished through reductions in
the EC oilseed subsidy programme,' said Mr Gary Riedel, president of the
American Soyabean Association, yesterday.
Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said 'it would seem from this
action that the US is not interested in peace in international trade.'
The EC proposal over oilseeds will be put to the next meeting of the Gatt
Council on June 19. At the last Gatt Council meeting the EC blocked a report
from the dispute settlement panel which, for the second time, found that EC
policies impair the duty-free status accorded to soyabeans as a result of
previous negotiations.
By declaring its intention to press ahead with its hitlist against the EC
under Section 301 of the US Trade Act, the US is being attacked by Brussels
for flouting Gatt procedures by initiating unilateral sanctions. US
officials recognise this, but say the administration may press ahead
nevertheless. Senior EC officials believe the Bush administration is bowing
to the electoral pressures building up on the president, pointing out that
the sanctions list homes in on France and Ireland, two hardliners in the
farm subsidies row.
EC figures also show that US soya exporters have lost out mainly to lower
cost soya exporters like Argentina and Brazil, at a time when European
imports of soya have expanded significantly.

A SENIOR US Senator yesterday warned that military action might be needed to
curb Serbia's territorial ambitions, writes Jurek Martin in Washington.
Senator Richard Lugar, the Republican from Indiana, urged the Bush
administration to take the lead in getting the United Nations and Nato to
bring about 'a stern enforcement' of a ceasefire in Yugoslavia and, failing
all else, to be ready to use force against the regime in Belgrade.
'The time for drawing the line has come,' he said. 'The UN should authorise
nation states to use force. Nato should draw up plans for a comprehensive
use of force as thorough as that formulated for air, sea and ground forces
in Desert Storm.'
'A final demand,' he went on, 'should be made for a ceasefire followed by
diplomatic resolution of claims and boundaries, with the UN or Nato, in some
combination, providing peacekeeping forces.' If Serbia did not yield, he
said, 'it should face sufficient military force to ensure its certain and
swift defeat.'
Senator Lugar's intervention is an attempt to break the logjam of US
political indifference to events in Bosnia-Hercegovina. The Senate foreign
relations committee is to take public discussion further today in special
hearings.

FT  11 JUN 92 / EC central banks to press ahead with monetary plans: Debate
on policy is calling into question UK institutions such as discount houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPE'S central banks intend to press ahead with a controversial attempt to
draw up a common European monetary policy despite the setback to plans for
economic and monetary union dealt by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht
Treaty.
According to senior European monetary officials, the issue, which already
has exposed big differences between the British, German and French central
banks, is potentially more contentious than the disputed location of the
proposed European central bank (ECB) itself.
The shape of a future European monetary policy and the way it is put into
practice could have a significant influence on European financial markets,
including London. The debate is calling into question specifically British
institutions such as the discount houses, which channel liquidity from the
Bank of England to the UK banking system, and raising the possibility that
Britain may have to adopt continental-style monetary instruments such as
minimum reserve requirements.
Any final decision on a European monetary policy will also influence the
structure and organisation of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB),
that under the Maastricht plan is due to be established in the third and
final stage of Emu.
Three models for operating a European monetary policy have emerged from
talks in the EC's committee of central bank governors and among senior
officials in the committee's monetary policy sub-committee and a special
'economic unit' attached to the committee's secretariat.
Most contentious is a decentralised system, proposed by the French central
bank, where the operation of monetary policy would be kept as far as
possible among the existing national central banks, which will coexist with
the proposed ECB as part of the ESCB. The French claim this principle best
conforms with the principle of subsidiarity, which calls for decisions to be
taken at the lowest possible government level.
There is a Bundesbank-type variant, in which monetary operations such as
repurchase agreements could be arranged through national central banks in
much the same way that the state central banks in Germany are at present
used to assemble and process bids for central bank funds in Germany.
A centralised system in which the monetary operations would be concentrated
in one location has also been under discussion.
This system would be analogous to the Bank of England's method of providing
funds and setting interest rates through institutions such as the discount
houses. However, it appears that the Bank has not been actively pushing this
idea as a model for Europe, because it realises that it would be impossible
to transfer UK-type institutions to the continent. Instead, it has supported
ideas for a decentralised system which would allow the UK to keep some of
its monetary institutions.
Some of the tension underlying these issues came to the surface last last
month in a speech given by Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president.
He rejected the centralised, British-style model as being inconsistent with
subsidiarity.
However, he did not spell out a more deep-seated German concern that the
French ideas could lead to national central banks setting slightly different
interest rates from those established by the ECB. This, the Germans fear,
would create competitive distortions and upset the principle that monetary
policy should be the same throughout a future economic and monetary union
with the primary goal of combatting inflation.
Many other difficult questions have to be resolved. A dispute between the
Bundesbank and Bank of England is possible over whether the future ECB could
force banks to deposit non-interest bearing minimum reserves with it to help
it control EC monetary policy. Another open question is whether the ECB
should set a broad money target for the eventual monetary union.
The Maastricht summit gave the job of preparing the single monetary policy
to a new European Monetary Institute, which is due to begin operating at the
beginning of 1994. However, the central bankers have decided that the issues
are so complex that they need to be tackled before that date.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Delors hits back at critics with warning of stagnation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STRASBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, the European Commission president, yesterday hit back at
critics of the planned increase in the European Community budget. He warned
that the EC would relapse into 'stagnation or crisis' if richer states
continued to resist an increase in contributions to the budget.
The 35 per cent boost in EC revenue proposed in the so-called Delors II
package came under attack from seven out of 12 members - led by Germany and
Britain - at Tuesday's meeting of finance ministers in Luxembourg.
Yesterday, Mr Delors told the European parliament in Strasbourg that the EC
would have to scale back its plans for 1993-97 drastically if member states
remained intransigent.
Holding contributions at the equivalent of 1.2 per cent of gross national
product until 1997 would provide Ecu11bn (Pounds 7.7bn) of additional annual
funding by 1997, against Ecu21bn under plans for a 1.37 per cent
contribution.
Mr Delors said: 'With that Ecu11bn we could finance the reform of the common
agricultural policy, the cohesion funds (for poorer EC members), to the tune
of up to Ecu10bn over five years, and external policy. But there would be no
increase in structural funds, and no increase for internal policies
(principally research and schemes to make EC companies more competitive).
Can we really envisage that?'
Finance ministers cannot block the package, but their comments are likely to
influence foreign ministers, who will discuss it on Monday, and EC leaders
in Lisbon at the end of the month.
'A realistic assessment of the attitude of the 12 at the moment makes me
think the budget will not be adopted in its entirety at the next European
Council (in Lisbon),' admitted Mr Delors yesterday. But he said he hoped for
a formal decision at the Edinburgh summit in December.
Mr Delors added that the Commission had prepared its evaluation of Britain's
rebate on budget contributions - worth Ecu3.3bn last year - and was waiting
for the right occasion to publish it.

OPPOSITION to the Maastricht Treaty in Ireland has doubled since the Danish

The Market Research Bureau of Ireland (MRBI) poll, commissioned by the Irish
Times, found that opposition to the treaty has doubled from 11 per cent to
23 per cent of voters since a similar poll taken a month ago. Those
indicating an intention to vote 'yes' have dropped from 57 per cent of those
surveyed to 47 per cent.
This still gives a proportion of two-to-one in favour of the treaty, but a
significant 30 per cent of voters are undecided, giving little cause for
comfort to the government whose campaign for a 'Yes' vote looks increasingly
as though it is foundering.
The interviews for the poll were carried out 24 hours before EC finance
ministers in Brussels rejected the Delors II package to increase EC funding
by 30 per cent, under which Ireland had hoped to receive a big increase in
structural funds.
On posters appearing around Dublin this week, and in leaflets dropping
through letterboxes, the government has been highlighting the importance of
the EC structural funds to Ireland's economy and to point out that Ireland
could expect to receive a doubling of EC structural and cohesion funds,
amounting to IPounds 6bn, for the 1994-98 period if the treaty is approved.
The government yesterday put a brave face on the turn of events in
Luxembourg. Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, said he will continue to
press his EC colleagues on the issue, and to hold out for a doubling of
funds to Ireland, although he acknowledged that compromise, and a scaling
down of expectations may be necessary.
'We are still at an early negotiating stage' he said.
A ministry spokesman said 'Either there is a commitment to cohesion and
equality in the community or there isn't. If there were to be a retraction
by a number of member states on those commitments, then that will change
people's attitudes significantly'.
Opponents of the treaty yesterday drew encouragement from the poll results
and the rejection of the Delors package. Mr Proinsias de Rossa, the leader
of the opposition Democratic Left party, who is leading a small
parliamentary grouping against the treaty, said: 'Doubts about the treaty
are likely to intensify as a result of this snub from the EC finance
ministers.'
The opposition Fine Gael party, which on Tuesday joined forces with the
ruling Fianna Fail party, to campaign on behalf of the treaty was also
critical of the government's handling of the campaign. The party said: 'We
thought it very unwise of the government to make promises that could not be
kept'.

<TEXT>
MORE THAN 60 professors of monetary economics and international finance,
from schools and universities across Germany, will today publish a
declaration condemning the Maastricht treaty on European economic and
monetary union.
Their intervention at a time of growing doubts about the Maastricht treaty
may be a serious embarrassment to the German government as it tries to gain
swift ratification in the two houses of parliament.
The document does not question the principle of Emu and a single European
currency, but criticises its haste, the decision to make such a move
automatic by 1999 at the latest, and the laxity of the convergence criteria
on which it is based.
They also question how genuine the independence will be of the future
European central bank.
Among signatories are such leading figures as Professor Herbert Giersch,
former head of the Kiel Institute, Professor Karl Schiller, former economics
and finance minister, and Professor Klaus Roser, author of the main German
textbook on international finance.

FT  11 JUN 92 / Regalian accounts qualified as property market flounders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTS of Regalian Properties, one of the best known UK quoted
property companies, have been qualified by auditors Ernst &amp; Young because of
the uncertainty future of the property market.
The auditors acted because of 'the very considerable uncertainty that
continues to affect the property markets and the difficulty of placing
valuations on potential development sites,' together with the uncertain
timing of property sales and the risk of a breach of bank covenants.
Regalian's fate is likely to be shared by many other property developers
this year, in the view of Mr Eugene Bannon, a partner of Ernst &amp; Young. 'It
will not be unusual to find qualification on uncertainty of value,' he
warned.
'We are required to get supporting evidence (for valuations). In a stagnant
or bombed-out market it is very difficult to get that evidence,' he said.
Mr David Goldstone, chairman of Regalian, said he believed that auditors'
caution concerning property accounts had been heightened by the recent
difficulties of Olympia &amp; York, Speyhawk, Mountleigh and Heron. The problems
in valuing property were highlighted last week when Heron's portfolio was
valued at Pounds 1bn, Pounds 300m less than a valuation a month earlier.
Regalian, which announced a pre-tax loss of Pounds 26.8m for the year to
March 31 and passed its final dividend, made provisions of Pounds 32.9m
against its portfolio. Its share price fell yesterday from 22p to 15p.
A block of luxury flats in Kensington Palace Gardens and a development site
at Paddington are the chief sources of uncertainty in Regalian's figures.
Although Kensington Palace Gardens is now valued at about half the asking
price of Pounds 120m a year ago, it is a difficult building to value. The
auditors queried the timing of Regalian's planned development on its
Paddington site, which is still valued at Pounds 23m.
A provision of Pounds 5m was taken against a Pounds 10m development site at
Heron Quay in London's Docklands, which has been mothballed because of the
insolvency of Olympia &amp; York, its venture partner.
A three-month review of Regalian's banking facilities ended last night when
the company's six banks, led by Barclays, agreed a Pounds 110m facility
until February 1994, with new covenants that included a target for
residential sales.
Mr Goldstone's son Lee, who has worked at Regalian for 12 years, has left
the company because of the constraints on new development over the next four
years.
By its year end, Regalian's net asset per share had fallen from 146.8p to
104.8p. It had gross debt of Pounds 130.1m and net assets of Pounds 122.7m.
The loss per share was 19.74p, compared with last year's earnings of 8.02p.

FT  11 JUN 92 / US allowed Indonesian arms sales to Iraq
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush administration gave its approval in November 1989 to Indonesian
government arms sales to Iraq, according to a declassified State Department
cable made public in Congress yesterday.
The cable is the first confirmation that the US gave explicit approval to
allies to sell arms to Iraq, while Washington was ostensibly operating an
embargo against Baghdad. The cable was sent to instruct a US envoy who was
to hold a meeting with an Indonesian minister over Jakarta's wish to sell
French Super-Puma helicopters to Iraq.
The cable, which was classified secret and sent by Mr Lawrence Eagleburger,
the deputy secretary of state, says: 'Although the US severely limits the
sale of our own munitions-list items to Iraq, we have not had a policy of
discouraging other countries' arms sales to Iraq. Such a policy is in effect
with regard to Iran.'
Mr Sam Gejdenson, a Democratic on the House foreign affairs committee,
yesterday released the cable along with other documents illustrating the US
'tilt' to Iraq, both before and after the August 1988 conclusion of the war
between Baghdad and Tehran.
Mr Gejdenson, who yesterday claimed that Mr James Baker, secretary of state,
had withheld documents from his congressional investigation into US
relations with Iraq, stressed the Eagleburger cable was sent less than nine
months before Mr Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and well after the end of the
Iran-Iraq war.
At the height of the US tilt to Baghdad, in a cable signed in June 1984 by
Mr George Shultz, then secretary of state, it was stated that 'under present
circumstances, in which Iraq is clearly on the defensive and Iran is in
little danger of defeat, we are not actively opposing non-US controlled
exports of arms to Iraq, which do not contribute to widening the war'.
Mr Gejdenson yesterday also released a late 1988 State Department memo -
entitled Guidelines for US-Iraqi Policy - that seemed to oppose any arms
sales to Baghdad, but simultaneously suggested making an exception to the US
ban on weapons sales by allowing the sale of C-130 transport aircraft and
computers.

<TEXT>
A JAPANESE-led consortium was yesterday given approval to buy the troubled
Seattle Mariners baseball team, marking the first time the sport has
permitted non-North American ownership of a big league club, writes Martin
Dickson in New York.
A committee of owners of the big league teams recommended the consortium's
Dollars 100m offer be allowed to proceed. The 26 teams which make up the
league are expected to give final approval today.
The purchasers, who include a large number of local Seattle figures, are led
by Japan's Yamauchi family, founders of the Nintendo video game company
which has its North American headquarters in the Seattle area.
The offer stirred up latent anti-Japanese sentiment in the US and the
consortium had to alter significantly its proposals to meet the baseball
owners' concerns over foreign involvement.
Mr Fay Vincent, the baseball commissioner, said yesterday the Yamauchi
family's role in running the team would be limited, consisting of 'the power
to approve certain transactions in the realm of extraordinary events'.

FT  10 JUN 92 / France faces new outbreak of violence in urban areas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French government's campaign against urban violence yesterday faced a
fresh challenge in the shape of two outbreaks of rioting near Paris and the
northern town of Tourcoing.
In Argenteuil, north-west of the capital, bands of youths smashed shop
windows and car windscreens, and threw petrol bombs late on Monday night, as
a result of which eight were arrested. In Tourcoing, petrol bombs were
thrown and a van set on fire after police tried to capture a stolen car
being driven through the suburb of Bourgogne. A day earlier in Tourcoing,
windows were broken and two cars set alight in clashes between youths and
policemen.
The Tourcoing disturbances were sparked after a young north African
motorcyclist fell when police approached him for not wearing a helmet. A
portable police radio was thrown, say eye-witnesses. At Argenteuil, the
spark was the murder of a teenage Arab by a drug dealer.
These new outbreaks are the latest in a two-year series of sporadic rioting,
starting in a suburb of Lyon in September 1990. Ironically, this comes just
a month after President Francois Mitterrand attributed the Los Angeles riots
to the lack of social protection in the US.
The French government, however, has made urban policy a big priority
recently. It will spend more than FFr6.2bn on urban renewal, development and
security this year. It has recently stepped up efforts to curb youth
violence in the hot summer months, the highest risk time.
Poverty and unemployment are thought to be factors in France's urban
discontent. This twin problem was a factor in the decision three years ago
to introduce a national minimum income (revenue minimum d'insertion) to help
those inadequately covered by other kinds of social security. Plans to
extend the scheme were yesterday presented to the National Assembly, which
is likely to adopt the scheme in the current session.

FARMERS blockaded the southern French city of Toulouse yesterday, stranding

Huge traffic jams built up during the day-long protest and spread to the

Near Paris, thousands of farmers drove tractors up to the gates of the
Versailles palace. They also burnt tyres and clashed with riot police
outside the government's local headquarters.
The Toulouse protesters lifted the blockade after the region's deputies
agreed to meet them on Friday and take up their grievances in parliament.

FT  10 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The gloomy mood seen in recent sessions in the derivative markets continued
yesterday, once again sending stock index futures to drift lower in volatile
trading, writes Joel Kibazo.
Optimists appeared to have the upper hand at the openning as the June
contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,652, a small premium to the underlying
cash market. That positive mood did not last for independent traders
(locals) moved to sell the contract causing an early retreat in June.
Sporadic buying was seen at the new lower levels which caused a turnround in
the contract, sending it up to 2,660, the high of the day, but it was not
long before the bears gained the upper hand sending June into retreat once
again.
Early falls on Wall Street caused a further decline and June eventually
closed at the day's low point of 2,638, down 10 on the previous session and
about 3 points below its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6.
Turnover at 5,745 lots was again poor.
There was a slight improvement in volumes in the traded options where total
turnover reached 29,994 contracts. However, turnover in the FT-SE option at
9,913 was down on Monday's 12,875 contracts. BAT was the most active stock
option. It traded 2,250 contracts with the August 750 puts particularly
busy.

FT  10 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Rally quenched after US selling bout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON equity market was showing signs of finding its feet yesterday
until a weak opening on Wall Street triggered a sudden sell-off in stocks in
the UK by a leading US securities house. The fragility of the UK market was
tested by renewed concern in the utility sectors after first BT, and then
water stocks, attracted the interest of their respective regulatory
authorities.
Share prices stood up well in early trading, brushing off an easier trend in
some European markets as they returned from the one-day holiday. The FT-SE
Index crawled above the 2,650 resistance mark again, helped by a recovery in
banking stocks and speculative demand for life assurance issues. Also
helping sentiment was a steadier performance from the futures sector.
But progress was checked by a fall in BT shares after Oftel, the industry
watchdog, said it planned to restrict future price increases. Trading in
both ordinary and partly-paid shares of BT was heavy.
The market's rally melted away as the US house began to sell stock and
London quickly turned down after Wall Street gave ground in early trading to
show a loss of 20 Dow points in UK trading hours.
The FT-SE Index closed at 2,635.4, a net loss of 10.4 leaving it just above
the day's low. Seaq trading volume, spurred by the sell programme, increased
noticeably to 488.3m shares from Monday's abysmal 305.7m. Customer, or
retail business in equities in London, fell to only Pounds 772.6m on Monday,
breaking a run of four consecutive sessions returning daily customer
business levels of over Pounds 1bn, the benchmark for a healthy, profitable
market.
Traders commented that the mood of the market was generally nervous and that
confidence was not helped by reports that some leading London-based houses
were beginning to lower their year-end forecasts for the UK market. The
absence of clear evidence of an economic recovery, together with the
uncertainty prompted by the growth of anti-Maastricht sentiment, have cast a
cloud over the near term outlook for equity investment.
While the London market is still considered to be fairly valued at current
levels, there is the underlying fear that its rating would be quickly
affected if the UK government's heavy funding programme is upset in any way.
London reacted sharply yesterday to suggestions from New York that Wall
Street is losing hope in any further easing of policy by the Federal Reserve
just at present.
Adding to the cautious mood of the stock market, last week's Pounds 242m
rights call from Blue Circle, the UK construction industry group, has
revived fears that the stock market could be hit by a new wave of funding
demands.
However, the mood was lightened by signs that UK equities may have been
oversold last week. The banking sector, the cause of much of the upset, was
in better shape as bid speculation died down and the arbitrageur holders of
shares in Midland Bank looked hopefully for a better lead from the share
price of Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking.

FT  10 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Oftel move hits BT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that Oftel, the telecommunications watchdog, had introduced a much
tougher price-capping formula than expected, hit BT shares, which
underperformed the market to close a net 7 1/2 off at 354p. The partly-paid
shares were also heavily sold and settled 7 lower at 133p. Turnover in the
'old' shares reached 12m, while the 'new' partly-paid stock attracted
turnover of 19m shares.
Oftel told BT that its price fixing formula would be altered to inflation
minus 7.5 per cent - compared with the current inflation rate of minus 6.25
per cent.
Oftel's move was more negative than expected but still manageable, according
to Mr Paul Norris at BZW. Mr Marshall Whiting, telecoms specialist at
Girozentrale Gilbert Eliott, the stockbroker, said Oftel's move 'kills off
suggestions that BT is loosely regulated'. He added that the price-capping
'runs the risk of putting too heavy a burden on BT's operating network; if
you pare costs too much and hold back on investment then the service will
inevitably deteriorate'. The Girozentrale analyst said BT shares 'will tread
water at best, possibly they will track the market'.
Mr Bobby Phillips of the telecoms team at County NatWest described Oftel's
moves as 'harsher than expected but almost in the price'. He said there
would have to be profits downgrades after the news. County reduced its 1994
estimate from Pounds 3.4bn to Pounds 3.3bn.
The BT price cap also affected Cable and Wireless, which, via its Mercury
telecoms operation, is BT's only UK opposition. C and W shares retreated 16
to 535p.
Frogmore placing
A placing of 3.9m shares in Frogmore Estates dragged the price down 32 to
268p. Regalian Properties, which had bought a stake of about 10 per cent in
Frogmore last year for around 350p per share following a rights issue,
placed these yesterday at 265p, against the overnight price of 300p.
Regalian, which lost a fifth of its value on Monday, falling 5p, recovered 2
to 22p yesterday, ahead of today's results, but dealers suggested that
questions were likely to be asked by shareholders after a particularly
ill-judged move.
It was estimated that after taking into account various expenses, Regalian
lost some Pounds 4m on the deal over the six-month period that it held the
shares. Regalian said that it had raised Pounds 10.57m through the sale and
would use it to reduce group borrowings.
In the banking sector, Midland Bank staged a strong revival after the sharp
falls of the past couple of trading sessions triggered a flurry of cheap
buying and the closing of short positions. The shares ended the day 6 higher
at 426p on hefty turnover of 14m.
Reuters unsettled
Reuters shares were unsettled by a cautious investment note from BZW. The
broker told its clients that 'the shares would need to fall to a price
earnings relative of 125 or below before we renewed our buy recommendation.'
BZW claims that the progress of Reuters' Dealing 2000-2 foreign exchange
dealing system has been no more than gradual; that liquidity on the system
is low with nine out of the ten banks involved in the Electronic Broking
Service, competitor to the Reuters system, deciding not to participate in
the initial phase of Dealing 2000-2 until it proves successful, hampering
the rate of take up. Reuters shares closed 14 lower at 1134p.
The insurance areas of the market were set alight by two stories; one, the
suggestion that Swiss-based Zurich Insurance, and UAP, the French company
were keen on buying a UK life assurance outfit; two, that life assurance
group London &amp; Manchester was about to adopt the method of transferring any
surplus from its life fund to the company's profit and loss account.
The news triggered a strong advance by all the life assurance stocks, with
Prudential leading the way and finishing 9 higher at 251p on heavy turnover
of 6.8m shares. London &amp; Manchester jumped 18 to 286p.
A block of 5.5m Refuge shares, just over 10 per cent of the equity, traded
at 705p very late in the session.
Composite insurance stocks also made strong progress led by Royal, shares of
which were boosted by hints that the long-rumoured sale of its Royal Life
subsidiary was imminent; Royal shares closed 9 higher at 254p, with a hefty
2.9m traded. Guardian Royal Exchange, long viewed by UK analysts as the
prime takeover target in the sector, moved up 5 to 155p.
Shares in bid target Dowty Group, the aerospace and information technology
company, currently the subject of a hostile bid from specialist engineering
group TI, closed a penny lower at 175p, equal to the cash alternative of the
bid terms. The view in the market is that TI is likely to emerge the winner
after today's 1pm deadline for the bid. One analyst said yesterday: 'It's in
the bag for TI, so it's the end of the road for Dowty.' TI also eased a
penny to end at 352p.
Land Securities slipped 11 to 397p as the company, with large property
holdings in the Victoria area of London, appeared to be badly placed in any
deal involving the movement of civil servants to Canary Wharf.
The oil sector remained under pressure but was helped by a bullish note
issued by Hoare Govett. The stockbroker said latest data suggested that OECD
first quarter demand rose by about 2 per cent, mostly attributable to
stronger demand than expected in North America and Europe.
'We believe that the prospects for sharp oil demand recovery after the
recession has been underestimated and that it should be possible for OPEC to
achieve oil prices which average to its target, Dollars 22 for Brent crude,'
said Mr Nick Antill at Hoare.
Ship builder Vosper Thornycroft jumped 25 to 325p after the company reported
a 12 per cent improvement in full year profits at Pounds 16m, ahead of
analysts forecasts. The market was particularly cheered by news of the
current order book put at around Pounds 700m stretched over a five-year
period. Predicting that current year profits would rise to Pounds 20m, Mr
Clive Forestier-Walker at Charterhouse Tilney said: 'Few companies have such
a strong long term order book and strong cash position.' Panmure Gordon, the
company's broker upgraded its forecast by Pounds 1.5m to Pounds 19m.
Turnover in Rolls-Royce rose to 5.1m and the shares firmed 2 to 165p.
Charterhouse Tilney favours the stock.
Powerscreen edged a penny forward to 282p after reporting an improvement in
full year figures. Mr Martin Ruscoe at Charterhouse Tilney predicted current
year profits of Pounds 22m.

FT  10 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Economic uncertainty leaves
equities lower
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
UNCERTAINTY among investors about the economic outlook and concern regarding
overvalued equity markets sent share prices into a brief tailspin yesterday,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 34.21 at 3,369.92.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 3.30 at
410.06, as did the Amex composite, down 3.37 at 393.06, and the Nasdaq
composite, down 8.21 at 573.80.
Turnover on the NYSE was 192m shares, and declines outpaced rises by a ratio
of more than two to one.
The market has moved little in the past three weeks, reflecting confusion
among investors about the short-term direction of share prices. Although
most recent economic data suggests that the recovery is advancing, albeit
very slowly, the pace of economic activity has been insufficient to generate
much fresh demand for equities.
Barring another interest rate cut, therefore, the market lacks strong
fundamental support, and it has become increasingly exposed to sudden
sell-offs spread across a range of cyclical and growth stocks.
Leading the way lower were classic cyclicals like Interna tional Paper, down
Dollars 2 3/8 at Dollars 64 7/8 , and Aluminum Company of America, down
Dollars 1 1/4 at Dollars 77 3/4 .
The former was not helped by a downgrade from analysts at the broking house,
Salomon Brothers, who cut their earnings estimates for several paper and
forest products companies to reflect pressures in the linerboard market.
Other stocks to suffer from the Salomon move were Georgia-Pacific, down
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 60 7/8 , Temple Inland, Dollars 1 1/4 lower at
Dollars 47 5/8 , and Stone Container, Dollars 1 weaker at Dollars 22 5/8
At the same time, Salomon also downgraded its ratings of several newspaper
groups. Knight-Ridder fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 56 1/2 , Washington Post
gave up Dollars 3&gt; at Dollars 235 1/2 and Gannett slipped Dollars 2 3/8 to
Dollars 44 5/8 . In the same sector, Tribune Co dropped Dollars 1 5/8 to
Dollars 40 5/8 after Smith Barney Harris Upham reduced its 1992 estimate for
the company from Dollars 2.05 a share to Dollars 2.25.
Among other stocks to post losses were IBM, down Dollars  1/2 at Dollars 90
1/2 , Walt Disney, Dollars  1/2 lower at Dollars 36 5/8 , Goodyear, down
Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 68 1/2 and Philip Morris, Dollars 2 weaker at
Dollars 74 1/8 .
Aetna Life bucked the trend, climbing Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 41 1/4 in
active trading after the company entered into a pact to sell its American Re
unit to a company formed by the reinsurance subsidiary's management and
Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the buy-out specialists.
Super Valu firmed Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 25 1/2 and Wetterau soared Dollars
6 3/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 on the news that the two companies, which are among
the biggest food distributors in the US, will merge in a deal said to be
worth Dollars 1.1bn.
Gencorp rose Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 14 1/8 after reporting second quarter
net income of 43 cents a share, up from 39 cents a share a year ago.
On the Nasdaq market, MCI Communications eased Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 32
3/4 as investors continued to digest the implications of the death of Mr
William McGowan, the longtime chairman of the telecoms group.
Canada
TORONTO prices closed lower in moderate activity which was boosted by three
large block trades.
Based on preliminary data, the TSE 300 index fell 8.39 points, or 0.25 per
cent, to 3,386.09. Declining issues led advances 321 to 256. Volume was
35.9m shares, up sharply from the previous 20.8m, and trading value was
CDollars 397.3m against CDollars 254.2m.
Tuesday's volume included three blocks - two in Mackenzie Financial
totalling about 7m shares, and one in Investors Group at 3.3m shares. Among
the sub-indices, ten of the 14 were lower. Financial services, mining,
energy and consumer products were all down somewhat and industrial products
group ended flat.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tin prices touch 2-year highs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIN PRICES rose to the highest levels for two years on the London Metal
Exchange yesterday, continuing the rise which has taken the three-month
price from Dollars 5,500 a tonne at the beginning of the year to more than
Dollars 6,500.
The breakthrough resistance at Dollars 6,500 for three-month metal early
yesterday triggered further orders to buy, but profit-taking emerged at
Dollars 6,550. By the close it had retreated to Dollars 6,502.50 a tonne, up
Dollars 47.50 on the day.
The move followed a rise in the Kuala Lumpur tin price above the
psychologically-important MDollars 16 a kilogram, an 18-month high. Kuala
Lumpur traders attributed the rise to a lack of sellers. They expect a move
above MDollars 16.20.
However, dealers at the LME said the upward move was driven by speculative
buying. The market was lacking fundamental developments and physical
interest was slack, they said.
LME warehouse stocks rose 60 tonnes to 12,775 tonnes. Mr Robin Bhar, analyst
with Carr Kitcatt &amp; Aitken, suggested that LME stock movements had been a
bit erratic and were not providing the firm undertone the market should be
seeking. While improved fundamentals and a better physical market had given
the price its initial impetus, 'it's looking a bit frothy now'.
'Consumer activity was noticeably absent,' said Mr Bhar, who believes that
the rise cannot be maintained unless fresh buying emerges.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia's restructuring plan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS FREISINGER INLA PAZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMIBOL, the Bolivian state mining corporation, has finally signed a joint
venture with Mineracao Taboca, a subsidiary of the Brazilian company
Paranapanema.
The 20-year contract, to exploit the vast tin tailing dumps of the
Catavi-Siglo Veinte mining complex in the department of Potosi, marks a
crucial step in the attempt to restructure state mining operations, but
threatens to ignite a fierce industrial conflict that the government may be
hard pressed to win.
Tin tailings are the remnants of ore after the metal extraction process. In
Catavi, 60 years of production before the closure of the mine in 1985 have
left a mountain of nearly 60m tonnes of tailings that still contain an
average tin grade of 0.3 per cent and from which tin can now be extracted
profitably using modern open cast mining techniques.
The joint venture will produce 2,900 tonnes of tin a year, about 2 per cent
of world output and will increase Comibol's tin production by around 40 per
cent to its highest level in a decade.
'This is an important event in the transformation of a backward industry
into one that is vigorously competitive,' says Mr Alvaro Rejas, the minister
of mines.
The government strategy for Comibol is to transform it from a state
corporation that directly manages mines to a holding company of joint
ventures with private mining groups. Last year it signed an agreement with
the world Bank to form six joint ventures by the end of 1991 in return for
credits to develop the mining industry. However, the unions have vowed to
resist any form of privatisation and have caused serious delays.
Until now only one other joint venture, Tasna, has been formed successfully
despite constant pressure from the World Bank. All other attempts have
either collapsed or are stuck in negotiation. At the beginning of this year
a deal over another important tin mine, Colquiri, brought a national miners'
strike with the support of other labour sectors. The government was forced
to back down and signed an agreement to discuss all future deals with the
union.
Mr Edgar Ramirez, leader of the miners' union, claims that the government
has broken this agreement over Catavi and that he has a viable alternative
plan that will allow the mine to stay in state hands.
Bolivia can ill-afford a more extended mining stoppage. Because exports in
the natural gas and agriculture sectors have already been hit badly this
year, any problems in mining would be harshly felt. Yet with elections due
next year, the government of President Jaime Paz Zamora is politically
constrained in the measures it can take to break a strike.
Caught between the rock of a declining reputation within international
financial institutions and the hard place of another damaging labour
dispute, the next few weeks promise to be uncomfortable.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Government backs Welsh food
drive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK government is putting its weight behind a drive to get food produced
in Wales accepted more widely. Wales has always been an important producer
of milk and lamb and the intention is to build on this base to enlarge the
food industry.
Mr David Hunt, Welsh secretary, said in Cardiff yesterday that there was no
reason why products closely identified with particular countries, such as
New Zealand butter, French cheese, Dutch potatoes, Scottish salmon, Greek
yoghurt and Swiss chocolate, could not all be produced in Wales.
He has doubled the funding for the Welsh Food Promotions to Pounds 1.2m this
year and given his support to a drive by the Welsh Development Agency, the
Development Board for Rural Wales and the Wales Tourist Board to get Welsh
produce better known and acceptable in a wider market.
Welsh Food Promotions 'is moving vigorously with its key objectives to
develop, co-ordinate and market Welsh foods,' Mr Hunt said.
'Wales produces food of all types and of the highest quality. The message of
quality is all important in winning acceptance for Welsh-produced food.'
The greatest success has been achieved by the cheese producers, who are
winning national acceptance for their products, especially the soft,
French-type cheeses. They have also had considerable success with 'Italian'
mozarella. Much of the mozarella sold in Britain now comes from south west
Wales.
Welsh lamb is also gaining more acceptance outside the principality.
The marketing drive will use the traditional Welsh dragon on a red and green
background to identify Welsh products.
'Welsh Food Promotions now has the resources and commitment to develop the
industry and become a recognisable force,' Mr Hunt said.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Export programme 'hitting US
poor'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE CONTROVERSIAL US Export Enhancement Program - the American export
subsidy scheme - has become a target of new criticism for taking bread from
the mouths of American schoolchildren, the poor and the elderly so that
wheat can be sold abroad at below cost-price.
The stockpiles of surplus commodities in the US Department of Agriculture's
warehouses have almost run out empty and the department has spent nearly all
of the Dollars 120m allocated in this year's budget to buy canned goods and
other foods to distribute to country's the poor.
Congressman Bob Wise, chairman of a government operations subcommittee, is
outraged that the agriculture department has had to cancel flour donations
because of the scarcity of government-held wheat stocks. Wheat supplies are
at their lowest levels since 1974.
'We have an agriculture programme that is taking away millions of lbs of
flour from the poor at the same time it spends a billion dollars a year
subsidising wheat exports,' the Congressman said at a recent hearing.
One of his staff members said schools would be forced to raise the prices of
the food they supply to pupils to compensate for the shortfall in government
donations. Other commodities - like rice, honey, oats and peanut butter -
are also in short supply.
The USDA, however, is proud of the success of US farm policy in reducing
government surpluses. Reserves have fallen from 6bn bushels in 1987 to about
1.5bn, as ofFebruary 1, 1992, and continued stock reduction is expected.
A large share of US wheat has been going under the EEP to the Commonwealth
of Independent States, which buys only if it gets credit. The Bush
administration recently announced the provision of Dollars 600m in new
credit for Russia and Dollars 110m for the Ukraine. For Russia, Dollars 300m
is available immediately with Dollars 112m of that being specifically for
wheat purchasing.
The USDA still has large supplies of butter. This week it donated 21,000
tonnes, worth about Dollars 30m to Russia. It also made 40,000 tonnes of
subsidised rice available to Algeria and donated 100,000 tonnes of maize and
sorghum to Jordan.

FT  10 JUN 92 / International Equity Issues: Emerging markets sustain flow
of offerings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN America and Asia continue to provide a steady flow of international
equity offerings for emerging market investors.
Banacci, one of the largest financial services holding companies in Mexico,
is launching a Dollars 1.5bn global offering, consisting of a Dollars 450m
international tranche, an Dollars 800m US tranche and a Dollars 200m
domestic offering.
Banacci's holdings include Banamex, the bank, and Accival, a leading
brokerage. Goldman Sachs is the lead-manager for the primary offering.
The Asian issues include a Dollars 90m global depositary share (GDS)
offering for Grasim, the Indian cement, textiles and fibre group, and a
Dollars 60m GDS offering for Asia Cement, a Taiwanese group.
Citicorp and Merrill Lynch are joint lead-managers for the Grasim offering
which comes close on the heels of a Dollars 100m international equity
offering from Reliance, the Indian petrochemicals company.
Although the Indian stock market has been rocked by a financial scandal, the
Reliance offering was considered a success and the response to the Grasim
issue so far has been 'reasonable,' according to a banker involved in the
deal.
The Dollars 60m issue from Taiwan's Asia Cement is expected to appeal to
Asian funds in Hong Kong, London and New York.
Asia Cement is the second Taiwanese company to launch a GDS offering,
following the large issue from China Steel last month.
Norges Kommunalbank, the Norwegian state-owned municipal financier, plans to
issue a four-year NKr500m bond backed by the Kingdom of Norway, Reuter
reports from Oslo.
Bids open on June 15. It it is to be an open bullet loan maturing in April
1996.

FT  10 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Europe's malaise benefits Ontario-Hydro
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONTARIO-HYDRO'S CDollars 2bn global bond offering, launched yesterday,
benefited from the malaise afflicting most European markets. Dealers
reported pent-up demand for high-yielding non-European paper, and the
10-year bonds were quickly sold out.
The bonds were priced to yield 68 basis points more than the comparable
Canadian government bond. Ontario-Hydro's comparable secondary market bonds
are trading at around the same level. By the end of trading, the spread had
widened by a basis point or two as a result of a rally in Canadian
government bond prices.
In the French bond market, Credit National launched two offerings, totalling
FFr3.5bn, fungible with outstanding issues maturing in 1994 and 1999.
Although political uncertainty over the French referendum on European union
continues to inject caution into the market, higher yield levels have
started to encourage domestic investors to return.
Both deals were priced to offer a yield pick-up over secondary market
levels, but bonds were not snapped up. The FFr1.5bn three-year deal was
priced to yield 30 basis points above the comparable French government BTAN,
a 15 basis point pick-up over the outstanding deal; and the FFr2bn 7-year
deal was set to yield 42 basis points over the comparable OAT, 10 basis
points up on existing paper.
Caisse Nationale des Autoroutes, the French motorway financing agency which
had planned to tap the Ecu market prior to its collapse last week, is now
likely to switch funding to either the domestic or Euro-French franc bond
market, according to bankers. France Telecom, which had also planned to
raise funds in Ecu, is not expected to seek alternative funding.
In the D-Mark sector, two borrowers took advantage of the firm tone of the
market. The Kingdom of Denmark launched a DM500m five-year deal, priced flat
to the German bund market, via WestLB, while LKB Baden-Wurttemberg, the
German regional bank, launched a DM1bn zero-coupon deal due 2012 via
Dresdner Bank.
Despite the strong tone in the market, issuance is likely to be limited by
the lack of swap opportunities.
Club Mediterranee, the leading French holiday village group, is expected to
launch a FFr1bn convertible bond issue within the next few days, writes Sara
Webb.
Club Med was hit by the Gulf war and the recession in some of its home
markets last year, at a time when it had just expanded its airline
interests. The company swung to a loss of FFr17m (Dollars 3.14m) in the year
to October 1991, compared with a profit of FFr395m in the previous year, and
investment bankers point out that it is likely to be seen by investors as a
recovery stock.
'There's nothing comparable in the market if you want to play the tourism
sector, and investors are likely to be interested in converting into the
equity given that this is a strong turnaround situation,' said one banker.
Credit Lyonnais has been awarded the mandate for lead-manager. The
seven-year convertible bond will be split into two tranches - FFr600m for
the domestic market and a FFr400m international tranche. The coupon is
expected to be set at 6.5 to 6.75 per cent and the conversion premium at 8
to 12 per cent.

IN THE absence of important economic figures, trading on US Treasury markets
was subdued yesterday.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  3/8 at 101
3/8 , yielding 7.873 per cent, while the two-year note was down 1/32 at 100
1/16 , yielding 5.074 per cent. Trading activity was reported to be light.
The only feature of the day was a technical squeeze in the overnight
two-year repurchase agreement market. Amid reports that one bank had control
of a big lump of two-years, prices rose in early trading as some players
struggled to cover short positions. Analysts said bond market business was
likely to remain light ahead of tomorrow's May producer prices and retail
sales data, which should provide the latest indication of the strength of
the economic recovery.
THE UK government bond market bounced back after its initial decline, helped
by the combination of better-than-expected producer output prices, buying on
weakness and a stronger German bond market.
The gilt market, which lost up to half a percentage point initially, ended
almost unchanged across the yield curve. Prices picked up on news that UK
producer output prices rose by 0.1 per cent in May, whereas an increase of
between 0.2 and 0.3 per cent had been expected.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at 115 7/8 and fell as
low as 115 13/32 before recovering to trade at 115 31/32 by late afternoon.
In the futures market, volumes were heavy with about 55,000 contracts
traded. The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 97.16, fell to a low of
97.07 and traded at around 97.27 by late afternoon.
THE European government bond markets continued to see a shift into the
Deutschemark bloc following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty.
There was further strong buying of German and Dutch government bonds and the
Liffe bund futures contract rose from 88.21 to end at around 88.37.
Among the high-yielding bond markets, Italy saw a pick-up in futures prices
although the cash market remained depressed. Dealers reported some interest
in buying the futures following Monday's sharp fall in the Italian market.
The futures contract opened at 95.27 and climbed to 95.99 while the 10-year
cash bond traded at around 95.28 against Monday's close of 95.70.
French government bonds (OATs) dropped sharply as foreign investors sold
their holdings, but the market later picked up on domestic buying. The Matif
futures contract opened at 107.38 and fell to a low of 107.14, but traded up
to 107.40 later in the day.
JAPANESE government bonds closed slightly weaker after trading in a narrow
range. The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue, which opened at 5.505 per
cent, ranged between 5.50-5.53 per cent and closed at 5.52 per cent.

FT  10 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Spearheading a leading
continental role for Germany / Examining Rolf Breuer's campaign to enhance
the country's strengths as a financial hub
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLF BREUER is a main board director of Deutsche Bank: among other things,
he is responsible for the bank's securities activities. He is also a leading
figure in the campaign to enhance Germany's strengths as a financial centre.
From his office high up in one of the bank's two Frankfurt skyscrapers, he
says: 'I would like to see Germany as the leading financial centre in
continental Europe in close co-operation with London.
'Our ambition is not to be better than London - we must stick with what is
realistic, and it would be illusory to think we could overtake London given
that city's traditional advantages. To be the leading financial centre on
the continent is more realistic.'
Mr Breuer's campaign bore fruit in January this year. The government in Bonn
announced plans to set up Germany's first nationwide regulatory body for the
securities industry. It said it would introduce an insider dealing law by
the end of the year. It backed plans for a central stock market for the
whole of Germany, and lent its support for further computerisation of share
trading.
These proposals emerged in the form of policy document written by Mr Theo
Waigel, the finance minister. A day later, Chancellor Helmut Kohl visited
the Frankfurt stock exchange - his first visit to Germany's largest bourse -
a powerful symbol of government support for what Mr Breuer and other
financiers are trying to achieve.
There has been further success within recent weeks. Germany's eight stock
exchanges abandoned age-old hostilities and agreed to form Deutsche Borse -
a stock exchange for Germany. It is hoped that this will reduce
inefficiencies and make it more attractive for foreign investors to buy
German shares via Germany - rather than via London, as happens for a
significant proportion of turnover in the shares of Germany's biggest
companies. Work on further computerisation of the stock market, supervised
by the McKinsey consultancy company, continues apace.
But, according to Mr Breuer, 'there is still a lot to do'.
He acknowledges that Frankfurt's reputation was damaged last year by insider
dealing allegations levied against the broking community. 'What we need
first of all is better supervision,' he argues. 'We had a lot of what you
might call 'mishappenings' in the summer of last year, and this stimulated
an international discussion about the moral standards of Germany as a
financial centre.'
Buzzwords of the debate were 'insider dealing' and 'front-running' (a
practice whereby brokers allegedly place personal buy orders ahead of
executing client's trades, thereby benefiting from sharp price movements).
There was doubt, especially in the press, as to whether Germany's securities
industry managed conflicts of interest in a fair and proper way.
'The problem has to be solved in a way which adds to the reputation of
Germany as a financial centre. An essential part is to establish a
centralised supervisory body, a body with real teeth - one which really gets
into things, which is respected, even feared by market participants. For
this we need the government to act, and in January this year, it did act.'
Mr Breuer is confident that the timetable can be kept to, with a new body
and insider dealing law by the end of the year. 'Drafts of the relevant
rules are already in the ministries, complete and ready to be discussed by
parliament. It is up to the minister to introduce the drafts into the
parliamentary procedures. The credit institutions are very interested in a
speedy procedure - we need to have it.'
However, he acknowledges that the plans may be held up as a result of a
dispute between Bonn and Germany's state (Lander) governments. The latter
are at present responsible for policing the stock markets on their patch,
and there is reluctance to cede powers to central governments. Mr Breuer
says what may be needed is an institutional structure which establishes a
central office in Bonn but which leaves day-to-day policing of the market to
the Lander.
Whatever the final institutional structure, Mr Breuer thinks the new
authority will only succeed if it is a 'quasi-governmental' body staffed not
by civil servants but by senior figures from the market who are paid market
salaries.
This new body and the insider law will be the government's contribution to
'Project market participants can do their bit, too, Mr Breuer believes.
At its 1991 results press conference in April, Deutsche Bank announced plans
for Anglo-Saxon-style compliance rules for its staff, based on the practice
at Morgan Grenfell, its UK merchant banking subsidiary, and at its New York
office. Other German financial institutions are in the throes of following
suit.
Mr Breuer plays down the significance of the location of a European central
bank: it would be 'helpful but not essential' to have the new institution in
Frankfurt. But he believes that Frankfurt is set fair to become the
financial capital of continental Europe by the end of the century, whether
it gets the new body or not.

FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: US wholesale food distributors
in Dollars 1.1bn merger
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of the largest wholesale food distributors in the US - Super Valu and
Wetterau - yesterday announced plans to merge their operations, in a deal
said to be worth around Dollars 1.1bn.
Assuming the transaction goes ahead and does not fall foul of the
competition authorities, the combined company would outstrip Oklahoma-based
Fleming Companies as the nation's largest wholesale food distributor.
Under the outline merger agreement, Super Valu would make a cash offer of
Dollars 30.20 for each Wetterau share, valuing the common stock at Dollars
643.3m. It would also take on Dollars 440m of outstanding Wetterau debt,
creating the overall Dollars 1.1bn price tag.
Ahead of this transaction, Missouri-based Wetterau would also 'demerge' its
Shop 'n Save subsidiary, distributing 70 per cent of retailer's shares to
existing Wetterau shareholders and retaining the remaining 30 per cent.
Shop 'n Save currently comprises a chain of 28 'superwarehouse' food retail
outlets, based in eastern Missori and Illinois. Its annual sales are about
Dollars 500m and operating profits about Dollars 10m.
plies around 2,650 supermarkets and food retail outlets in 31 states, mostly
operated by independent retailers. It also has around 105 retail outlets of
its own. Total sales last year were Dollars 10.6bn.
Wetterau, meanwhile, distributes food and non-food products to about 2,850
retailers and over 1,200 institutional customers in 29 states.
Both companies said yesterday that the rationale behind the deal was
potential operating efficiencies and greater geographical reach.
However, Moody's, the Wall Street rating agency, said that it was placing
debt ratings of both companies on review for a possible downgrade. Moody's
acknowledged that there could be operating cost benefits from the merger,
but noted that the food distribution industry has been hit food price
deflation, weak consumer spending and increased competition.
Shares in Wetterau, quoted on the NASDAQ over-the-counter market and
currently ranking as the nation's third-largest grocery wholesaler, jumped
Dollars 6 3/8 to Dollars 30 3/8 yesterday, while Super Valu, the
second-largest food distributor, lost Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 25 1/4 .

<TEXT>
TELEVERKET and PTT Telecom, the Swedish and Dutch state-owned
telecommunications companies, have signed up Sprint, the US
telecommunications carrier, as their first partner in a venture aimed at
providing European-based multinationals with internal communications
networks on a global basis.
Under a preliminary agreement with the US company, the 50-50 Dutch-Swedish
joint venture, called Unisource, will also buy an unspecified amount of
Sprint equipment as part of its efforts to build telecommunications networks
for European-based international companies.
Sprint will not take an equity stake as part of its involvement in the
venture.
Unisource said yesterday it was also negotiating with an unnamed Asian
carrier about participating in the telecommunications network.
The Dutch-Swedish joint venture, which was first announced in October under
the provisional name Unicom, is scheduled to be fully operational on
September 1, when services in the UK, Germany, Sweden and the Netherlands
will begin.
Unisource's network will be extended to Belgium, France, Norway, Denmark and
Finland later this year, with southern Europe soon to follow.
Global coverage is planned from 1993 through SprintNet, the US company's
worldwide data network.
Unisource officials said the joint venture marked the first time that
telecommunication companies anywhere had agreed to pool their international
activities in a company which will operate at arm's length from both parent
companies.
The company's services will range from data network services to messaging
services such as 'fax store' and 'fax forward'.
The joint venture, which underlines Swedish and Dutch ambitions to expand
beyond their limited home markets, hopes to capture 20 per cent of the
market for pan-European business communication networks.
Unisource estimates this market is worth an annual Ecu2bn (Dollars 2.56bn)
and is set to double over the next three to four years.

by Tokyo stock losses
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S big life insurance companies, hit by steep drops in Japanese share
prices and interest rates, posted sharp declines in their returns on
investment in the year to March 31, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
With the Tokyo stock market showing no signs of recovery and premium income
growth slowing, the life insurers would continue to pump much of their new
money into domestic loans to secure stable returns, according to industry
officials.
The eight leading life insurers announced their business results for 1991-92
yesterday .
Return on investment at the eight companies ranged from 4.75 per cent to
6.13 per cent, down more than one percentage point from a year earlier.
'The gaps between insurers are widening, and will continue to widen, based
on their skills as investors,' said an official at Meiji Mutual Life
Insurance.
Assets at the eight insurers rose to Y110,310bn (Dollars 875.47bn) in
1991-92, an average growth of 8.5 per cent and the slowest rate since the
Second World War.
Officials ascribed the slow tempo to lower sales of savings-oriented
insurance products and poorer returns on investment. The eight companies
account for more than 75 per cent of the assets held at Japan's 26 life
insurance companies.
With 'risky' securities holdings at high levels, the investment heavyweights
trimmed their foreign currency assets by an average 1.6 per cent in 1991-92
to Y17,110bn at end-March.
Dai-ichi Mutual Life Insurance and Meiji Life bucked the trend, increasing
foreign assets by 8.0 per cent and 4.6 per cent, respectively. However,
Nippon Life Insurance slashed overseas assets by 8.6 per cent, Sumitomo Life
Insurance by 9.5 per cent, and Asahi Mutural Life Insurance by 1.2 per cent.
At the same time, the insurers were cautious about domestic equities because
of low returns and high volatility since the 225-share Nikkei average index
fell about 26 per cent in 1991-92.
Nippon Life cut its holdings of foreign securities to Y3,380bn in 1991-92
from Y3,500bn a year earlier. As a result, foreign securities as a share of
assets fell to 11.7 per cent at the end of March, from 13.1 per cent a year
earlier.
The sharp decline in Japanese share prices in 1991-92 forced the eight life
insurance companies to take a securities write-down of Y1,870bn, an increase
of 135.3 per cent from a year earlier.
Life insurers would remain net stock buyers in the current year since they
expected their assets to grow, but would remain cautious about equity
investments, according to the officials.
An official at Nippon Life, Japan's largest life insurer, said his company
would continue to allocate new money mainly to domestic loans and domestic
bonds in the 1992-93 financial year.
Unrealised share profits at the eight insurers fell to Y8,430bn at end-March
from Y21,610bn a year earlier.
After the write-down of securities and plunges in unrealised profit in
shareholdings, the eight insurers will cut dividends to policy-holders in
1991-92.
'It is a sign that Japanese insurers will be forced to offer different
dividends to policy-holders in future,' said Katsuhito Sasajima, an analyst
at Nikko Research Centre.

HUNGARIA Biztosito, the Hungarian insurer in which Allianz, the German
insurance group, has acquired a majority stake, lost Ft8.5bn (Dollars 108m)
on its car insurance business in the last financial year.
The company blamed the worse-than-expected results on a sharp rise in crime
in Budapest, where car thefts have increased to between 60 and 100 a day.
'We were not pessimistic enough,' said Mr Ferenc Kiss, a Hungaria director.
However, insurance industry officials said the loss was due to the company's
inexperience in Western underwriting practices. Hungaria had taken on
business at premium levels well below the cost of reinsurance on the
international market, they said.
Mr Christopher Gore, director of MAI Biztositokozvetito, a leading
independent broker, said that insurance had attracted the largest foreign
capital inflow of any sector in Hungary. The combined lack of expertise and
the risks of the business have resulted in 'disaster', he said.
Foreign investment in Hungarian insurance stands at over Dollars 500m.
Twelve western companies have acquired former state insurers or set up new
subsidiaries.
Most recently, Aegon, the second-largest Dutch insurer, took a 75 per cent
stake in state-owned Allami Biztosito for a reported Dollars 50m.

earnings growth to 8%
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
REMBRANDT, the South African tobacco group, has posted a modest earnings
increase of just under 9 per cent for the year to end-March as weak results
from associate companies held back its overall performance.
Net income before tax rose by 22 per cent to R1.17bn (Dollars 416.3m), with
the after-tax figure up by 21.4 per cent to R747.7m.
These figures primarily reflect the performance of the group's unlisted
tobacco interests, the diversified industrial group Huntcor and interest
income. The pre-tax figure also includes R221.3m of dividend income.
Analysts estimate that tobacco earnings grew by 10 to 12 per cent and that
interest earnings were boosted considerably by the sale last year of
Rembrandt's stake in the Stanbic banking group.
The group's share of net income retained by associates dropped by 16 per
cent to R269.9m. The decline reflected the poor performance of the group's
mining and industrial interests.
Gold Fields, in which Rembrandt has a 17.4 per cent stake, reported flat
earnings in the six months to December, while Gencor's earnings were 26 per
cent down in the year to February.
Rembrandt has a 25.2 per cent stake in the parent, Gencor Beherend.
There were also weak performances from other Rembrandt industrial
associates, including Huntcor, Dorbyl and Metkor.
As a result net income from Rembrandt's normal business operations was only
8.8 per cent higher at R941.1m.
Earnings per share were up by a similar margin at 180.3 cents, with a total
dividend of 32.6 cents a share. A special dividend of 30 cents a share was
also declared earlier this year.
The results are modest by Rembrandt's standards, reflecting the weak state
of the South African economy. Most of the growth appears to have come from
tobacco operations. Rembrandt has about an 80 per cent share of the South
African tobacco market.

BANC ONE, the US banking group, is unlikely to make another acquisition this
year, Mr John McCoy, chairman, said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Milwaukee.
'I think the likelihood of us doing another transaction is less than 10 per
cent' this year, Mr McCoy said after a speech to the Wisconsin Bankers'
Association.
Banc One recently announced it would acquire West Virginia-based Key
Centurion Bancshares in a transaction valued at about Dollars 536m, or
Dollars 22 a share. Key Centurion has Dollars 3bn in total assets.
That announcement came on the heels of news in April that Banc One was
acquiring Valley National Bank of Arizona in a Dollars 1.2bn stock deal.
Under the leadership of Mr McCoy, Banc One has been concentrating on a
conservative lending policy in the retail banking sector and has maintained
a return on assets that is among the highest in US banking.
Last year, Banc One bucked the national trend by turning in a 25 per cent
increase in net profits, to Dollars 529.5m.

transfer deal

<TEXT>
FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft builder, and Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of
Germany, say they have made progress in negotiations over a transfer of a 51
per cent stake in the Dutch company in return for fresh funds to finance the
development of new aircraft.
After talks in Amsterdam, the two sides reaffirmed that Fokker would be the
'lead company' in the regional aircraft segment. However they also
underscored that Dasa would have 'industrial leadership' of the overall
partnership.
This formula, which accords leadership roles to both companies, is emerging
as the most promising way to get around Dutch sensitivity to the transfer of
one of the country's premier industrial companies into foreign ownership.
The talks, which began in March, have been hampered by a seeming difference
in interpretation of Fokker's role in a future European aeroplane-building
consortium. The controversy has fanned national sentiment in the Netherlands
against the proposed deal.
The two companies said the talks would be concluded before the summer
holidays.
The Dutch government, which owns 32 per cent of Fokker, is prepared to see a
majority of Fokker's shares pass into German hands, but it is keen to secure
guarantees about the company's future.

FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bank to take holding in
Aerospatiale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais, the French state-owned bank, has agreed to take a minority
stake in Aerospatiale, the debt-laden, government-controlled aircraft maker,
writes William Dawkins.
The investment is likely to attract the scrutiny of the European Commission
in its continued vigilance against state industrial subsidies, though
Brussels is unlikely to block the scheme if it conforms to a previous
judgment.
Although Credit Lyonnais and Aerospatiale said they had agreed on the cash
injection in principle, they would not confirm French press speculation that
the bank would pay FFr1.5bn (Dollars 280m) for a 10 per cent stake in the
aircraft maker.
Aerospatiale needs cash because recent heavy industrial investments have
driven up its net debts to FFr14bn, just over twice its FFr6.8bn
shareholders' funds. Profits recovered last year, to FFr213m net, from a
FFr396m loss in the previous year but new orders fell 50 per cent.
A cash injection of the size being envisaged will not dramatically improve
Aerospatiale's balance sheet. Yet any reduction in the pressure on its
spending is likely to be welcomed by its partners in the Airbus consortium.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Great Portland static as asset value falls
for third year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GREAT PORTLAND Estates yesterday underlined the continued pressure on
central London property values by announcing a 26 per cent fall in its net
asset value, from 286p to 212p, for the 12 months to March 31, its third
consecutive year of declining assets.
Pre-tax profits increased marginally, from Pounds 33.8m to Pounds 33.9m,
before taking account of an extraordinary loss of Pounds 13.7m which
resulted from the disposal of its investment in Bride Hall, an investment
and trading company.
'It is generally accepted that we face the worst conditions to have been
experienced in nearly half a century,' said Mr Richard Peskin, chairman.
'Recovery from this deep recession is likely to be slow and fragile and,
inevitably, property values will lag behind any general improvement in the
economy,' he said. He expected the next year 'to be primarily one of
consolidation'.
Mr Peskin said that the dividend was likely to be maintained. 'At this time
I have no reason to feel that, except in the most unlikely of circumstances,
the current dividend of 10p will not be paid for the year ending March 31
1993,' he said.
Over the period, the company spent Pounds 300m in reducing the exposure to
central London from 83 per cent to 67 per cent and increasing its re-tail
and industrial property from 14 per cent to 24 per cent.
Rental income increased by 20 per cent to Pounds 70.7m. Gross rental income
at the end of the period was more than Pounds 82m a year, of which 85 per
cent is expected to be secure for three years.
The company has cash balances of Pounds 24.8m and more than Pounds 100m of
unused facilities.
Voids comprised 7 per cent of floor area and 10 per cent of gross rental
income, representing Pounds 8m of rental income.
Great Portland's investment property was valued by Hillier Parker at Pounds
874m, reflecting a yield of 9.2 per cent on current income, representing a
decline of just under 14 per cent for the year.
The revaluation comprised an 18.7 per cent decline in London's West End,
Victoria and Covent Garden; a 19.4 per cent fall in the City and Holborn; a
4.3 per cent fall in outer London and suburbs; and a 3 per cent rise in the
prov-inces.
Office and commercial property fell by 16 per cent; retail and showroom by
4.6 per cent and light industrial by 8.8 per cent.
Earnings per share fell from 11.5p to 11.2p. A final divi-dend of 6.6p is
proposed making an unchanged total for the year of 10p.
COMMENT
An otherwise dreary chairman's statement was leavened with Mr Peskin's
idiosyncratic wit. 'When the going gets tough, the tough get gearing]' he
declared, alluding to acquisitions which reduced the company's exposure to
central London. The comment slightly nonplussed the City; although it
approves Great Portland's strategy of reducing its exposure to London
property, its increased gearing of 75 per cent leaves little room for
manoeuvre. Apart from letting the voids in its portfolio, it is treading
water until the London property market recovers. For several years, pre-tax
profits and dividends, which are only just covered, are likely to be static.
The net asset value is likely to drop to about 190p this year, before a
small uplift the following year. Prospects are unexciting for the shares -
down yesterday from 153p to 152p - which are on a discount to net assets of
20 per cent and a yield of 8.8 per cent.

<TEXT>
Regalian Properties has sold its stake of 3.99m shares in Frogmore, another
property company, for Pounds 10.6m.
Regalian described the holding as a 'strategic stake' when it bought it last
October for Pounds 14m. It said it would give it an interest in
income-producing property at a discount to net assets and was in line with
its strategy of developing an investment portfolio.
City analysts assumed that Regalian was preparing to make a full bid and
that its plans were thwarted by its inability to sell a Pounds 80m block of
flats in Kensington.
Regalian acquired the holding from Southend Properties, which bought the
stake when it launched its unsuccessful Pounds 139m bid for Frogmore.
Regalian is due to announce its annual results today.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Accounting change lifts life companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES AT leading life assur- ance companies yesterday rose on the news that
London &amp; Manchester had won approval for an innovative accounting change
which will boost its profits.
Exeter-based London &amp; Manchester expects its 1992 profits to be increased by
at least Pounds 3m as a result of the change which will allow it to transfer
profits contained within life assurance funds to its shareholders at a
faster rate.
L &amp; M closed at 286p, up 18p. Anticipating that other life companies may
follow L &amp; M's lead, the market marked Refuge up 15p to 705p, United
Friendly by 11p at 418p, and Britannic 18p higher at 938p.
The accounting change allows L &amp; M to offer shareholders quicker access to
surpluses earned on investments from non-profit protection policies and
unit-linked life policies.
The way that surpluses are distributed on with-profits policies will remain
unchanged. Each year L &amp; M allocates 90 per cent of the surpluses earned on
with profits policies to policyholders in the form of annual (or
reversionary) and final bonuses (paid at the end of the policy period). The
remainder is paid to shareholders. However with-profits policyholders also
receive some of the surplus earned on non-profits and unit-linked business
and will obtain lesser amounts from this source in future.
L &amp; M had won the approval of the Department of Trade and Industry and the
Government Actuary's Department that the revised basis is consistent with
the requirement to ensure that the 'reasonable expectations of policyholders
are met', although it will need to notify its with-profits policyholders of
the change.
Mr Tom Pyne, group chief executive, said: 'Shareholders will get their
proper earnings but more quickly. Profits had been earned but we couldn't
release them from the life fund.'
He added the group's unit-linked business was growing faster than
with-profits policies and that the change would allow for quicker
recognition of profits.
L &amp; M's profits, which amounted to Pounds 21.2m in 1991, have been adversely
affected by problems on its mortgage book. According to analysts the change
should strengthen dividend cover. L &amp; M also warned that rates of
reversionary bonuses - which are paid to with profits policyholders each
year - will have to fall as a result of falling investment returns.

FT  10 JUN 92 / PowerGen year-end profits rise 32%: Cost cuts and price
rises boost electricity generator
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the smaller of Britain's two privatised electricity generators,
yesterday announced a 32 per cent increase in profits for last year, above
market expectations.
Mr Ed Wallis, chief executive, said the increase was due to cost cutting,
price rises and a 50 per cent increase in direct sales to industrial users.
Meanwhile, Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, warned
PowerGen not to force too hard a bargain out of British Coal in the current
negotiations over long-term coal supply to the electricity generators. He
said: 'Remember when you are negotiating these contracts that you are
determining the future availability of a national resource for which you
have longer-term need.'
PowerGen's results were condemned by Mr Frank Dobson MP, Labour's shadow
energy minister: 'The profits show that electricity privatisation has become
a legalised racket with huge profits for the shareholders and massive pay
and perks for the bosses.'
Labour is expected to keep up its attack as National Power, the other
generator, and the 12 regional companies report profit increases of up to 40
per cent, helped by one-off price factors.
PowerGen increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 272m to Pounds 359m in the
year to March 29. Turnover increased 14 per cent from Pounds 2.65bn to
Pounds 3.01bn, helped by average price rises of 9 per cent.
The company cut its workforce by more than 2,000 people to just over 6,000
during the year. Exceptional provisions of Pounds 94m were made to cover
future redundancies and closure of power stations. However, there were
exceptional profits of Pounds 88m from two power stations closed in March.
Mr Wallis said there was less uncertainty about the March 1993 deadline for
renegotiation of contracts with British Coal and the regional companies.
The company's shares fell 4p to 249p on profit-taking after a strong run.
Earnings per share increased 35 per cent from 23p to 31p. The company is
recommending a final dividend of 6.2p to make a total of 9.25p. Professor
Stephen Littlechild, director-general of electricity supply, agreed
yesterday with the Commons energy committee that National Power, PowerGen
and Nuclear Electric were too dominant in the electricity market.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Labour exploits Tory split by changing Maastricht tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative party was in disarray last night over the Maastricht treaty
as Labour maximised its discomfiture by warning it may vote against
ratification.
Amid reports of wide-ranging Tory divisions reaching as far as the cabinet,
Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, said his party would back
ratification only if Britain accepted a new social chapter of workplace
rights.
The move came as Tory backbenchers, reportedly with the tacit backing of
some cabinet ministers, met to plan a broadly-based group to oppose further
progress on the Maastricht bill, shelved until the autumn.
Speaking at Commons' question time, Mr Hattersley said Labour would only
support a bill which included those parts of the treaty most of benefit to
the British people 'and that specifically includes the social chapter'.
His words were taken as giving notice that Labour would no longer abstain
from voting but would instead side with Tory opponents of the Maastricht
agreement by voting against it.
The tactic adds to pressure on the government from by its own backbenches to
abandon the agreement.
Several rightwing members of the cabinet have also emerged as doggedly
opposed to ratification of the treaty as it stands. While some may favour a
dilution of the existing terms, there is no prospect of the government
dropping its opt-out from the treaty's social provisions.
Mr Tony Newton, leader of the Commons, said it was now up to all 12 member
states to find ways forward following the Danish decision to oppose
ratification. In Strasbourg, Mr John Smith, favourite for the Labour
leadership, put the case for a realignment of currencies in the European
exchange rate mechanism.
In a significant policy development for Labour, he said an upward alignment
of the D-Mark against other currencies would trigger reductions in interest
rates across the Community.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Generators warned on long-term coal deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S privatised elec-tricity generating companies came under pressure
yesterday from Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, not to
drive too hard a bargain with British Coal in the current negotiations over
long-term coal supply.
The outcome of those negotiations will crucially affect both the value of
British Coal when it is privatised next summer and also the number of pits
that will remain viable.
Addressing the annual conference of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers
(UDM) in Weymouth, Mr Heseltine stressed repeatedly that it was not the job
of government to intervene directly in the negotiations.
But, in line with his interventionist instincts, he added: 'Remember when
you are negotiating these contracts that you are determining the future
availability of a national resource for which you will have longer-term
need.
'Remember also that you are talking about communities of men and women whose
lives will be affected by your decisions.'
His comments follow indications that the generators are ready to buy about
45m tonnes of coal a year, falling gradually to 30m. The current agreement,
which runs out next year, commits the generators to buy 65m tonnes.
Mr Heseltine guaranteed that British Coal employees would get a stake in its
future, whatever form of privatisation is chosen.
He said that no final decision had yet been taken on how to privatise
British Coal. He expressed sympathy, however, for the UDM-led consortium
which aims to take a 25 per cent stake in the corpor-ation.
Mr Roy Lynk, president of the UDM, said he would approach British Coal board
members to join the consortium as well as the main management unions. Mr
Lynk welcomed Mr Heseltine's speech, as a 'green light' for the UDM-led bid.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Four convicted in biggest UK insider dealing prosecution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR former employees of finan-cial institutions, alleged to have been part
of the first insider dealing ring to be prosecuted, were convicted at the
Old Bailey yesterday.
At the end of the biggest UK insider dealing prosecution, which, with the
Department of Trade and Industry investigation which preceded it, is
understood to have cost about Pounds 350,000, Judge Laughland spoke of a
'web of illegality'.
He said tape recordings of telephone conversations between the four
displayed 'greedy cynicism' in 'brazen defiance' of the law passed to
inhibit insider dealing.
'You were part of a network of associates who thought it right quite openly
to defy the restrictions on the communication of inside information, for
your own financial benefit.
'The mischief of your offences is that they are, if uncontrolled,
destructive of the confidence which the international financial community
reposes in the City.'
Damage had been done not only to other investors or potential investors in
the City but to the whole financial community and to the public, the judge
said.
He said Mr David Gray, formerly a stockbroker with Morgan Grenfell
Securities, had been 'very much at the centre of this web of illegality'. Mr
Gray was given concurrent six-month prison sentences, suspended for two
years, and fined Pounds 5,000, on each of two convictions of dealing on the
basis of price sensitive information.
He was conditionally discharged for 12 months on each of five charges of
communicating information, to four of which he had pleaded guilty. He was
also ordered to pay Pounds 10,000 towards the prosecution costs.
Mr William Liggins, a former Lazards fund manager, was fined Pounds 5,000 on
a dealing charge, conditionally discharged for 12 months on a communicating
charge and ordered to pay Pounds 5,000 costs.
Miss Catherine Rowlands, formerly in Samuel Montagu's corporate finance
department, was given a 12-month conditional discharge for a communicating
offence. She must pay Pounds 2,000 costs.
Mr Mark Riding, former fund manager with the Co-operative Insurance Society
in Manchester, convicted on two dealing charges, was fined a total of Pounds
10,000, with Pounds 5,000 costs.
The offences related to two takeover bids in 1988. Hawthorn Leslie Group,
the USM-quoted cellular phone company, acquired ECT Cellular and London Car
Telephones, and Goodman Fielder Wattie, an Australian company, made a bid,
which lapsed, for Ranks Hovis McDougall, the UK foods group.
After the verdicts, Mr Peter Clarke, prosecuting for the DTI, said the case
stemmed from an investigation into dealings in shares of Pleasurama, the
leisure group, at the time of a bid by Mecca Leisure.
During the trial the judge directed the jury to acquit the four, and their
original co-defendant, Mr Keith Tondeur, former head of principal trading
and sales with Banque Paribas, on seven charges related to dealings in
Pleasurama shares.

Stumped by a breakdown, the manager of a process plant sent for the retired
engineer who'd set it up and still lived near by. After a brief inspection,
he took a hammer, hit a pipe above his head, and the plant began working
again. The manager thanked him, and told him to send his bill.
When it arrived the next day for no less than Pounds 1,000, the horrified
manager rang him, protesting that it was a lot to charge for one
hammer-blow. 'Oh no,' the engineer answered. 'Only Pounds 1 of it is for
hitting the pipe. The other Pounds 999 is for knowing where to hit it.' him'

Publishing group Emap is a prolific launcher and buyer of magazines.
Purchases alone have brought it 17 consumer magazines, 28 business magazines
and five newspapers in the past half-decade. But its pride and joy, besides
being much the most profitable is Motor Cycle News, a tabloid bought in 1955
for Pounds 250.
Quite the reverse of a glossy, it is definitely the favourite of Emap's
group chief executive Robin Miller who was once its editor. He still likes
to to roar about town on test bikes supplied to Motor Cycle News.
The weekly, whose financial success is based on small ads for second-hand
bikes, was founded by Cyril Quantrill who, unable to make a go of it, sold
it on to a printer. Some time later, the printer sold it to Emap.
But the present owner finally bumped into the creator of the money-spinner a
couple of years ago on buying the south England local press group Senews.
It was discovered that Quantrill, then aged 70, still worked as a sub-editor
on the acquisition's paper in Hastings.
Whereupon Emap's top brass mobilised for a trip there to present him with a
silver figure of an old motor-cyclist sporting the inscription 'Motor Cycle
News'. The figure cost far more than Emap had paid for the title.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt the great and the good attending today's CBI conference on
corporate governance will continue to huff and puff about the need for
non-executive directors. But are the institutions which put up the money
doing any more than pay lip service to the idea?
Take yesterday's Pounds 20m rights issue from Marshalls, the Halifax-based
building materials firm. After 22 years at the helm, David Marshall stepped
down as chairman last year handing over to brother Andrew. Although the
Marshall family does not have a huge stake in the company, six out of the
eight directors in its last annual report were called Marshall.
Like most firms in its industry, Marshalls is going through a bit of a rough
patch and it might have been thought that the City would insist on a few
non-executive directors to keep an eye on the shop in return for
underwriting the new capital. However, adviser Samuel Montagu insists that
'these guys are straightforward Yorkshire folk' and sees no need for them to
bow to the latest fashion.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What's in a title? That's the question Rothschild-watchers are asking after
a curious reshuffle at the top of the North American end of the investment
banking empire.
Transatlantic deal-maker Robert Pirie - who had been chief executive of both
Rothschild Inc and its parent Rothschild North America (RNA) - has been
promoted to co-chairman of the US holding company while continuing as
chairman of the flagship subsidiary.
The 58-year-old Pirie, who has cut deals for everyone from Lord Hanson and
Sir James Goldsmith to the late Robert Maxwell, remains chief executive of
both entities. But Gerald Goldsmith, an executive managing director of
Rothschild Inc, is being given the new titles of president and chief
operating officer of both Rothschild Inc and RNA.
In London, Sir Evelyn de Rothschild is full of praise for Pirie's takeover
talents, but notes that Goldsmith is going to be the key man handling
day-to-day operations. Sir Evelyn, who will become chairman of the US
executive committee, is giving up his co-chairman's hat at RNA so that Pirie
can wear it, along with the Paris-based Baron David de Rothschild.
Pirie himself notes that he and Goldsmith are old friends who've worked
together for 10 years - and will go on doing so on day-to-day matters. The
reshuffle, says Pirie, 'doesn't mean anything.'

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Which of the folk who navigated Britain's water industry into the private
sector will be the first to pull the plug on his career? Given all the fuss
about water charges, the drought and generous perks, the chairmanship of a
water plc is not the comfortable haven it may have seemed.
True, the stability - if not stagnancy - of the companies' chairmen since
privatisation contrasts sharply with the rapid ebb and flow among their
underlings. But a few top retirements could well soon be in the pipeline.
North West Water's chairman Dennis Grove, for one, is 65 next month and so
it would be no surprise if he asked to be relieved of further duty. His
deputy, Littlewood's chief executive Desmond Pitcher, would make an
admirable replacement. Moreover, several of Grove's counterparts in the
other companies are also well into their 60s, and must be wondering whether
it's worth swimming on, especially if they are not going to land
knighthoods.
If they decide to go, Observer will be interested to see whether it proves
as easy to recruit the next generation of chairmen as the first.
After all, now the industry is privatised there's less need for a full-time
chairman as well as a chief executive. Hence the rate for the job should
drop, even though the complaints look likely to go on rising.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Letter: Graduates should think smaller
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr J MARSHALL and Mr R HANAGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The otherwise excellent article by Andrew Adonis ('School's out', June
6) the plight of graduates in the 1990s failed to recognise that there is a
huge potential market for graduates in small businesses in the UK.
Unfortunately, owner/managers of small businesses are still daunted by the
prospects of using a graduate, and many graduates believe that success in
job-hunting is measured mainly by the size of the company they join. This is
often reinforced by parents giving the strong impression that you only have
a 'proper job' if you work for ICI or Marks and Spencer.
The experience at Durham is that when we do succeed in getting a graduate
into employment in a small company, it nearly always works very well for
both the business and the graduate. Many stay with the businesses for
several years, and even when they move on they usually opt to stay in the
small company sector.
As more and more graduates come on to the market we need to re-double our
efforts to open up these opportunities via increased use of various
programmes such as STEP, the 'Teaching Company Scheme', and the 'Graduate
Associate Programme'. John Marshall,

FT  10 JUN 92 / Letter: Absurdity which stultifies the role of UK company
boards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Sir RONALD GRIERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Sir Owen Green has done such an excellent demolition job (Personal
View, June 9) on the absurdities of the Cadbury Report that very little
remains to be added. There is, however, one aspect on which he touches only
lightly and which in my opinion deserves greater emphasis.
British corporate governance differs from that of most other countries in
its implicit (and sometimes quite explicit) assumption that boards of
directors determine policy while management - a lower grade - see to its
implementation. Hence the reference in the Cadbury Report to boards 'driving
their companies forward'.
Nowhere else is such an assumption made or accepted. I have myself had the
privilege of serving on boards of three of America's biggest corporations;
the notion that their members were 'driving' anything in any sense would
strike them as quite odd. In the US and on the European continent management
is top-dog for both policy and implementation - and enjoys the accompanying
prestige - while boards, though possessing the ultimate deterrent, confine
themselves in practice to ensuring that management does not run amok.
The British custom of attributing prestigious policy functions to board
members has many consequences, some of which give rise to the very problems
analysed in the Cadbury Report. Perhaps the most absurd of all is that it
compels senior managers to perceive board status as the ultimate and
indispensable prestige symbol, thereby partly stultifying the essentially
supervisory role which corporate boards should be performing.

FT  10 JUN 92 / From bare shelves to blue jeans: Western groups are building
brand names in central Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Warsaw, where housewives once waited hours to buy the everyday
necessities of life, the only queue nowadays is for jeans from the Levi
Strauss boutique - at Dollars 50 a pair. Nearby, in the shadow of Stalin's
towering 'Palace of Culture', giant tents house a supermarket and stalls
selling everything from Beluga caviar to compact discs.
In central Budapest, the signs of new affluence are even more striking.
Gleaming BMWs and Mercedes glide past shop windows filled with
designer-label clothing, Mont Blanc pens and other icons of the
status-conscious. Blink, and it could almost be Vienna or Milan.
In spite of the parlous state of local economies, such visions of plenty are
increasingly common across central Europe. After years of enduring
shortages, shoddy products and dreary shops, shoppers are tempted on every
street corner by western consumer goods which have become tangible symbols
of their liberation from communism.
For many western manufacturers, the attraction is mutual. In the past 18
months, large household name companies such as Coca-Cola, Pepsico Foods,
Levi Strauss, Philip Morris, BAT, Unilever, Procter &amp; Gamble and Electrolux
have moved in to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia to acquire local
production bases and distribution systems.
Though their strategies differ, all are making the same calculated gamble.
By braving the region's political and economic uncertainties and often
chaotic business conditions, they hope to come to dominate some of the
fastest-growing markets of the future.
'Central Europe today is like America in the 1930s and Britain in the
1950s,' says John Lindquist, a consumer industry specialist with the Boston
Consulting Group. 'There is a golden opportunity to establish brands and
strong market franchises from scratch.'
But what are the chances of the gamble paying off? Hungary and Poland offer
contrasting yardsticks. A much longer history of economic liberalisation has
given the former a head start, but the latter's larger population makes its
market potentially a much bigger long-term bet. Both, however, face many
similar challenges.
In each country, much of the recent conspicuous consumption is froth on the
surface of shaky economies gripped by a savage monetary squeeze. In Hungary,
overall consumer demand has been plummeting for two years. In Poland, a
retail boom has recently started to sag.
Equally, consumer spending is dominated by small elites who have rapidly
grown rich by methods of varying legality, while much of the rest of the
populations has grown poorer. In both countries, as few as 10 per cent of
consumers are estimated to control half the purchasing power.
Gabor Varszegi, an entrepreneur who is probably Hungary's wealthiest man,
reckons the easy killings will soon be over. Having rapidly built an empire
by setting up photo-processing and cosmetics shops and importing luxury
goods such as Ray-Ban sunglasses - which he sells for three times the US
price - he says his next moves will be outside consumer markets in areas
such as energy supplies.
Some of the pain among the very poorest classes has been eased by
flourishing black economies, visible in continuing large volumes of smuggled
imports which often sell at bargain prices. Until recently, the Polish and
Hungarian governments have accepted such activity as an antidote to social
friction. However, the budgetary costs of doing so are rising.
In a desperate effort to raise revenue, both governments have piled taxes on
locally produced goods. However, higher prices have simply encouraged
smuggling. In coffee-loving Hungary, where the drink carries heavy taxes,
about 40 per cent of the market is supplied by illegal imports. There is
also a darker side. In Poland, where the customs service has an unenviable
reputation for corruption, cigarette smuggling has acquired the hallmarks of
highly profitable organised crime.
Such developments raise a basic question. Can central European countries
build efficient and competitive markets which will support the solid wealth
creation needed to fuel rising consumer demand? Or will they become
candyfloss economies, shaped by the values of local yuppies, wheeler-dealers
and a sleazy assortment of conmen?
The role of the multinational investors may be decisive. Though still small
in numbers, only they possess the skills and resources required to translate
the goals of economic reform swiftly into functioning business reality.
Furthermore, in countries desperately short of practical experience of
capitalism in action, the local operations of multinationals are the only
role models at hand.
The impact of consumer products companies is particularly crucial. Because
their activities directly affect the daily lives of millions of people and
require an extensive distribution, marketing and sales infrastructure, they
impinge on local economies across a wide front.
Many of them have seen acquisitions in central Europe as a quick way to
achieve market share - a goal helped in Hungary by the rushed privatisation
of some near-monopoly producers such as NMV, a margarine producer bought by
Unilever and Ferruzzi in February. However, such monopolies face growing
competition from imports and newly arrived western manufacturers. Local
production also enables goods to be priced at affordable levels - typically
about two-thirds of those in the west. But the condition of plants varies
widely. A few were so bad that their new western owners scrapped them.
Others have required limited work to achieve acceptable standards.
Most western newcomers are impressed by the quality of local employees, many
of whom are technically proficient, adaptable and eager to learn - though
woefully lacking in financial and marketing skills. But few companies have
yet seriously tackled the over-manning which exists in many plants - an
especially sensitive issue in Poland, with its politically powerful trade
Obtaining indigenous raw materials is relatively easy - suppliers just turn
up outside the factory gate. But importing can be much more problematic,
particularly in Poland, where western manufacturers complain of long delays
at customs unless they pay bribes.
The toughest challenges, however, begin once goods leave the factory.
Because local producers traditionally ignored sales and marketing, most
larger western companies have had to recruit and train local sales forces
and educate retailers in how to promote their products from scratch.
Much the biggest headache is physical distribution. In Poland, state-owned
monopoly wholesalers collapsed almost overnight after liberalisation. In
Hungary, the process has been more gradual, as former regional monopolies -
some of which own shops - have retreated in the face of competition.
But though the privately owned businesses which have sprung up to fill the
gap are often energetic and enterprising, most are poorly financed and
organised. 'Nobody has any capital and nobody takes credit,' says Andrzej
Szwarc of DMS, a small Dutch-Polish company which markets products for Mars,
the US food company. 'We have started to extend credit, but we go to bed
with the thought that if a wholesaler goes bust, so do we.'
Many bigger companies are training local wholesalers. Even so, Kzrysztof
Sokolik, Philip Morris's manager in Poland, says none yet covers the whole
delivery chain all the way to retail outlets.
Some companies are also supplying outlets directly. Coca-Cola, for instance,
has 150 sales and delivery trucks on the road in Poland. However, in the
first six months, Coke found that 60 per cent of its retail customers had
changed.
Though hundreds of thousands of retail outlets have sprouted across central
Europe in the past two years, many are little more than hole-in-the-wall
operations with fragile finances. Even in bigger stores, basic techniques
such as managing shelf space and stock turnover are still almost unknown,
and supplies erratic. 'When my wife sees imported products she wants in the
shops, she buys 10 of them at a time,' says Patrick Knight, head of
Colgate-Palmolive in Hungary.
Distribution has received little attention from western retailers which,
unlike multinational manufacturers, have so far been slow to enter central
Europe. The Austrian Julius Meinl supermarket group and Tengelmann of
Germany have invested in Hungarian chains, which they are helping to
modernise, and some franchise boutiques have been established. But in
Poland, the government appears reluctant to sanction big investments by
foreign retailers for fear of jeopardising the survival of the many newly
created small shops which it regards as one of the proudest achievements of
reform.
Yet most western managers in central Europe remain optimistic that, with
patience and energy, these obstacles can be overcome. In the words of Robert
Combee, Dutch-born head of Compack, a Hungarian coffee company bought last
year by Sara Lee of the US: 'People here feel it's a chance of a lifetime.'
How far locally owned producers will share in that chance is another
question. Some, notably Polish breweries, have reasonably strong brands and
quality and are trying to go it alone. But most are reeling from the loss of
former Comecon markets, fierce import competition and massive debts.
Their managers are often remarkably clear about what needs to be done to
make them competitive by improving quality, packaging and marketing.
However, they are equally aware that the challenges are probably too big to
handle alone, and that they can only hope to survive by rapidly finding
western owners.
Acute capital shortages are an obvious barrier to expansion. However, many
local managers feel that other handicaps are equally important. They include
outdated technology, minimal management and marketing skills and - above all
 -an almost total lack of experience of how modern businesses work.
The dilemma is crisply summed up by Krzystof Bialowolski, president of
Hortex, a large Polish food processor which is looking for foreign investors
while struggling under a mountain of debt. 'If you gave me Dollars 50m
today,' he says, 'I would simply have to turn around and spend Dollars 10m
hiring advisers to tell me how to invest it in the business.' That admission
is a measure of the distance central Europe has yet to travel to create
modern market economies. But the fact that such issues are being recognised

FT  10 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: A market made out of muck -
Expectations are high for the first public deal to trade pollution permits,
but the scheme's long-term future is far from secure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last month, three US utility companies bravely waded into a national
experiment to use market principles for environmental ends.
In the first public deal to trade permits to pollute, the Wisconsin Power &amp;
Light Company sold 10,000 allowances to the Tennessee Valley Authority and
15,000-25,000 allowances to Duquesne Light Company in Pittsburgh. Although
the deal was widely hailed, it is far from clear whether the overall
experiment will work.
The allowances are part of the Clean Air Act of 1990, which requires
America's mostly coal-burning utilities to halve their emissions of sulphur
dioxide, the key ingredient in acid rain, by 2000. Under the act, those
companies which exceed compliance with the emissions standard - by
installing new, cleaner technology or switching to lower sulphur fuels - can
sell their allowances, issued by the Environmental Protection Agency, to
those that have not fully complied. In theory, the total national cap on SO
emissions will be achieved in the most cost-effective way by trading the
rights to pollute among utilities.
Enthusiasm for the scheme even led the EPA administrator, William Reilly, to
declare when announcing some of its rules last October: 'The acid rain
programme could become a model for other EPA programmes and indeed is
causing us to rethink the way we approach environmental protection.'
But, while hopes are high for its success, the results of the first national
test of a market solution in the US are not yet in. The initial trade,
announced May 12, has helped 'break a log jam' on starting the market,
according to Richard Sandor, a managing director of Kidder Peabody and the
mastermind of the idea that a commodities futures contract could be built on
allowances.
John Henry, founder and president of Clean Air Capital Markets, the small
investment banking boutique that acted as broker for the transaction between
the Wisconsin Power and the TVA, said his company has been inundated with
calls from interested parties.
Yet, even those who believe in the programme say that it will probably take
until next year to know whether the market will take off or founder. Several
impediments may slow or block its development.
The foremost barrier is that the tax and accounting treatment for the
allowances has not yet been worked out by the public utility commissions
that regulate power companies. This is especially important given that this
is a regulatory-driven market.
The crux of the issue is that regulators have not spelled out who - the
rate-paying consumers of electricity or the company's shareholders - is to
benefit (or lose) from the trading of allowances.
'If all the gains go to rate-payers instead of the shareholders, there will
be little incentive to use the market,' said Tony Visnesky, chief of the
electric policy section of the Illinois Commerce Commission, which oversees
utilities. 'On the other side, to what extent are rate-payers burdened if
the company has to buy allowances?'
If, for example, companies implement new technology the capital costs could
be passed on to rate-payers. If they then have excess allowances, it would
seem logical that the gain from the sale goes to rate-payers. However, if
companies were unsure that they would be able to cover their capital
expenditures with higher rates, their shareholders might prefer to buy
allowances. These could then be treated as expenses in the companies'
accounting, and the cost possibly passed on to rate-payers with little or no
risk to shareholders.
Visnesky believes that some formula for allocating the benefits and risks of
the allowances will have to be worked out. Illinois is likely to arrive at a
first draft of a policy by mid-summer, he says. The state has more urgency
than others to formulate a clear policy. It is a top producer of
high-sulphur coal and stands to lose if the market for its coal shrinks
substantially.
The only decision so far on the regulatory matters, which will no doubt be
scrutinised by others, is being appealed. In the case of Wisconsin Power,
the revenue from the sale of its allowances is set to go entirely to
rate-payers, but the utility is asking its regulator to allow some benefit
to go to shareholders.
'It will really be the public utility commissions that dictate whether this
programme is successful or not,' said Thomas Brooks, vice president of
Aer*x, a subsidiary of Electronic Data Systems which also aims to broker
allowance deals.
Aer*x has considerable experience with such transactions, having brokered 80
deals in regional markets for pollution permit trading since it was founded
in 1984, according to Brooks. Trading permits in discrete regional markets
have been part of US environmental laws since 1978, though the number of
deals has been modest.
A second hurdle for the allowances market will be how to heat up demand. At
present, surveys of utility companies show that they are tending towards
over-compliance with the new standards - mostly by installing new technology
to remove SO from flue gas, known as scrubbers, and some through fuel
switching. The inclination to over-comply means that there will be extra
allowances. Prices, therefore, should be kept pretty low, according to David
Baker of the Illinois Department of Energy and Commerce. 'They want to be
ahead of the game and not be dependent on the market,' he said.
Union Electric of St Louis, Missouri seems to typify some of the attitudes
of utilities. 'It's a great concept and we hope the market works well,' said
Jerrel Smith, a UE vice-president. But he explained that the company would
'bank' its allowances to cover any unexpected events such as the necessity
to reduce electricity generation by its nuclear plant and raise generation
at its coal-fired plants.
The desire to hoard allowances stems in part, too, from the way the EPA has
structured the emissions reductions. In Phase I, which runs from 1995 to
2000, 110 of the dirtiest plants have been targeted to reduce their
emissions. But in Phase II after 2000, a permanent annual cap of 8.9m tonnes
of SO has been set. This means that any future requirement to increase power
generation by a utility will have to come under the ceiling, boosting either
the need for installing clean technology or the demand for allowances.
Allowances may not become hot commodities until the turn of the century.
According to polls done by Aer*x of power companies, public utility
commissions, coal producers and pollution equipment vendors, allowance
prices are expected to rise after 2000 to about Dollars 600 per tonne (one
allowance equals one tonne of SO). This compares with the Dollars
250-Dollars 300 per tonne in the first deal. The EPA's penalty for emitting
excess SO is Dollars 2,000 per tonne.
Of the total 5.7m allowances available annually in Phase I and the 8.9m
available yearly in Phase II, 2.8 per cent will be creamed off by the EPA
for public auction and direct sales, starting next year. This is aimed at
allowing new power companies which have no allocations some access to them.
The proceeds of the auctions and sales are to be returned to the utilities.
While the supply and demand in the market might seem based on economics and
logic - for example, the allocations per utility were calculated on the
basis of their emissions between 1985 and 1988 - the process was riddled
with politics.
A number of companies, for instance, lobbied successfully for extra
allotments. They pleaded special circumstances such as being in a
high-growth state like Florida.
With all the complications, even some of biggest promoters of the allowances
market, such as Henry at Clean Air Capital Markets, are only cautiously
optimistic. 'We jump-started the market,' he says, referring to the first
deal. 'But it could choke out.' If it does, it will be a big setback for
those who believe in market solutions to environmental problems.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Clash over job opportunities for
minorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ATTEMPTS to compel companies to provide jobs for a specified proportion of
the ethnic minority communities in their area might 'backfire,' Mr Kenneth
Clarke, the home secretary, warned in the Commons last night.
Reaffirming the government's determination to combat racial discrimination,
he said, however, that subjecting employers to a legal requirement to
achieve target numbers would be a difficult and dangerous course to follow.
Mr Clarke emphasised that it would be damaging to race relations if white
members of the workforce believed that their black colleagues were there
only because the law required them to be admitted, regardless of their
suitability for the job.
He said the Commission on Racial Equality (CRE) would have to produce 'a
strong argument' if it wished to move the government in such a direction.
Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, who opened a debate on the ethnic
minorities in British society, argued that a disproportionate number of
British black and Asian people were unemployed, and that they suffered from
a lack of equality in job opportunities.
He rejected the imposition of quotas or 'positive discrimination' but called
for the CRE to monitor the results of employers' efforts to ensure that
their workforce was 'fundamentally representative' of the local population.
Mr Hattersley urged that the monitoring process should be reinforced by the
government refusing to award contracts to companies that could not
demonstrate that they operated 'fair employment policies'.
The home secretary reaffirmed his commitment to monitoring as part of a
positive employment policy which good employers should follow.
But he insisted that the government could not accept the kind of compliance
which some Labour-controlled local authorities had sought to impose.
Mr Bernie Grant, the black Labour MP for Tottenham, gave a warning that high
unemployment and youth service cuts meant young people had nowhere to go and
were turning to drug trafficking.
He said: 'Youth workers tell me there is tension on the streets, that youths
are planning Los Angeles-style riots or disturbances in my area, and that
unless something is done, especially in the summer, we can expect trouble'.
A Labour motion calling on the government to introduce and implement
policies which would eventually eliminate the disadvantages suffered by
ethnic minorities was defeated by a majority of 47 (311-264).

FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Staff relocation pledge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE continuing depression in the housing market has contributed to a
Treasury decision enabling departments to make more generous arrangements
for civil servants forced to relocate and facing losses if they sell their
homes.
Mr Stephen Dorrell, the financial secretary, said yesterday that the
government is to make provision for staff who find that the sale of their
previous property is not enough to repay their mortgage.
Departments will be able to offer people in this category loans on
commercial terms and, in particularly difficult cases, offer advances of
salary to meet mortgage shortfalls.
The decision comes just a week after Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary, announced that 2,000 officials in his department were to move to
Docklands, but is primarily directed at the relocation of civil servants out
of the south-east.
When the Docklands plan was announced more than 1,000 DoE civil servants
held an angry meeting in protest. The meeting, which was organised by four
Civil Service unions, heard calls for industrial action to stop the move.
London and the south-east have been among the areas where property prices
have been particularly affected by the slump over the past two years or so.
About 3,000 staff from the Ministry of Defence are planned to move to
Bristol, more than 1,000 Inland Revenue staff are to go to Nottingham, while
part of the Home Office is moving to Derby and part of the Department of
Health is moving to Leeds.
The new arrangements will not necessarily mean more money is available, but
will give departments greater flexibility.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bowing to the new orthodoxy - The
Conservative Euro-Sceptics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Conservative minister was quite definite. 'There is a peasants' revolt
taking place across the Continent,' he said. 'What is more, for every
doubter on the back benches, there is another in the government.
Euro-scepticism is the new orthodoxy.'
As the prime minister flew into the sublimely irrelevant Colombian capital
of Bogota yesterday, he left behind him a party rank and file openly
plotting rebellion and confident that many cabinet ministers are wishing
them well.
All eyes are now on an embattled government or, more specifically, on Mr
Douglas Hurd and Mr John Major, architects and chief advocates of a treaty
that now straddles a political fault line down the centre of the party.
But with the party leadership all but frozen by the political and diplomatic
hurdles at home and abroad, the initiative, for once, lies with the
opponents of any ratification of the treaty.
These are believed to include at least six junior ministers, along with Mr
Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, and Mr Michael Portillo, the
Treasury chief secretary.
Other rightwingers such as Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, and
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, are at the very best 'don't knows' on how
Britain should proceed in the European Community's presidency. Not a single
cabinet heavyweight has yet spoken up loudly for the official
steady-as-she-goes line.
Meanwhile, Mr Hurd himself - only six months ago Britain's newest statesman
hero - is increasingly being characterised as a stooge of Europhile civil
servants, loftily out of touch with sentiments in the party and the country.
'Douglas made a fundamental error when he argued for ratification,' a
colleague said. 'At the very least, he could have talked about fine-tuning.'
So close to a famous election victory, the parliamentary Conservative party
is a long way from issuing a humiliating rebuke to its leadership.
Yet yesterday, an inner circle of backbench MPs met in Westminster to draw
up a plan of action to halt the Maastricht bill, now shelved until autumn.
Furthermore, some wiser and greyer backbench heads have signalled their
readiness to oppose. As Mr George Walden, the intellectual MP for
Buckingham, wrote yesterday the party must now move away from the treaty as
a united body or risk 'a rift far deeper than anything that has been seen up
until now.'
He added: 'It would be a fundamental mistake to believe that, once the
Community has engineered some arrangement for the Danes, ratification can
proceed in the Commons and that the Conservative party will toe the line as
it nothing has happened. It won't'
Mr Major, ever an advocate of the long game, must be well aware of that.
Equally, he must be more than conscious that every twitch of the British
body politic, soon to take up the EC presidency, will be being relayed by
teams of diplomats back to the capitals of the UK's European partners.
That is to his advantage. In any future negotiation, he can warn his
European colleagues that it is not merely the Danes who need to be
mollified.
Already, some senior Tories are counselling that a British presidency can
justifiably demand that Brussels devolves powers back to member states as an
act of contrition for its arrogance - an abuse of power, they claim, that
provoked a Continent-wide backlash.
Yet none of that resolves the UK government's two-tier conundrum: how to
resolve the international impasse and hold the party together at home. Mr
Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy leader, made clear yesterday that the
government could expect no help from the opposition benches.
Labour's price for supporting the government - a British signature to the
social chapter of the Maastricht agreement from which the government took
pains to opt out - is unpayable.
The view of tougher Tory Euro-sceptics is that the government must seize on
Danish obduracy to insist on a full renegotiation of the treaty. Moderates
recognise this may be impossible, but will require at the very least some
form of words imposing enforceable checks and balances on the Brussels
bureaucrats.
But will that be enough to keep the party at least sufficiently united to
see off a Labour alliance with Conservative backbench rebels?
With no obvious routes ahead, the ever-cautious Mr Major may well decide to
use his EC presidency simply to pose his quandary to his European colleagues
 -themselves equally lost in the post-Maastricht maze. Armed with the
goodwill gleaned from his pro-Maastricht stance, honest John as honest
broker is an unhurried act he may find tempting to play.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Warning on tram funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TOWNS and cities hoping to install modern tram systems similar to that
recently opened in Manchester have been told by the Transport Department
that their plans will have to wait.
They have been been given advance warning by Mr Roger Freeman, minister for
public transport, that the autumn public-spending round will contain no
money for any new schemes to go ahead in the next financial year.
The principal victim of the crack-down will be the West Midlands, which had
hoped to get the go-ahead for Line One of the Midland Metro from Birmingham
to Wolverhampton.
Midland Metro had already received Pounds 4.5m in government grants for
preparatory work on the line, and felt confident that the government would
give it the money to start construction next year.
Other towns and cities facing postponement of their projects are Nottingham
in the east Midlands, Leeds in West Yorkshire and Croydon, Surrey. The
planned Sheffield supertram system in South Yorkshire, however, will proceed
as planned because construction has already started.
Mr Freeman's announcement of the cash freeze on new tram projects is an
early indication of the pressure which spending ministers will face in this
year's spending round. There are fears in the public transport sector that
rail, bus, tram and underground projects will be squeezed to preserve the
Transport Department's Pounds 2bn-a-year roadbuilding programme.

LIBERAL Democrats yesterday interpreted a warmly worded letter from Mr John

help the government win a Commons majority on the Maastricht treaty.
The prime minister told Mr Paddy Ashdown, Liberal Democrat leader, that he

wanted to go faster on European integration and had reservations about the

FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs attack Brussels on 'ageism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission was branded 'ageist' in the Commons yesterday as
Conservative MPs renewed their attacks on Brussels' employment-related
policy initiatives, David Owen writes.
Sir Michael Neubert, the Conservative MP for Romford, enlivened a subdued
session of employment questions by urging the government to 'root out' the
'blatant' example of ageism provided by the Commission's conditions for job
applicants.
Was it not against the spirit of the times for the Commission to limit
applicants for its own posts to people of 35 or less, he asked.
Mr Michael Forsyth, employment minister, said ageism was 'not only an
undesirable policy, it is a stupid policy'.
The government announced measures to cut waiting time for employment appeal
tribunals hearings. It promised proposals allowing the tribunal president to
sit alone in certain cases.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Council speeds up tendering - 'No
case for white-collar sacred cows' says Westminster leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTMINSTER City Council, the Tory-controlled London authority, has set an
ambitious timetable for subjecting its main white-collar services to
compulsory competitive tendering, in advance of government plans to force
all local authorities to do so.
Westminster's contracts committee is likely to award the council's public
relations and publicity business - worth about Pounds 500,000 a year - to
two private companies tomorrow. Contracts for managing the council's
property investment portfolio have been awarded to the private sector.
Under the timetable, parts of Westminster's information technology, planning
and legal work will be put out for competitive tender in batches late this
year and early next. Housing management is to go to tender by April 1994,
when a market-testing exercise is to be completed for the council's
libraries, legal, planning and building control services.
Although a few adventurous Tory councils contracted out services in the mid
1980s, compulsory tendering officially began less than four years ago.
Before then, councillors of all parties had resisted the idea.
In the early 1980s, Westminster pioneered the tendering of blue-collar
services. The council's present plans are in advance of the government's
proposals for white-collar services, which have met fierce hostility from
unions and local-authority associations. They argue that it is far more
difficult to set effective quality standards for white-collar than for
blue-collar services.
Mr David Weeks, Westminster's Tory leader, said: 'We are succeeding in
setting quality targets. There is no case for white-collar sacred cows.'
Westminster is also extending tendering to more blue-collar functions.
Contracts for waste transfer are likely to be awarded tomorrow to MRS
Environmental Services - the management buy-out that already runs the
council's refuse collection.
Mr Weeks says the investment portfolio contract might yield savings of
Pounds 650,000 over five years, while the waste transfer contracts might
save more than Pounds 1m over three years.
Contracts issued by Westminster are worth nearly Pounds 50m a year - more
than a fifth of its non-education budget. Of the 35 contracts already let,
all but eight have been awarded to the private sector.
Nationally, more than 80 per cent of contracts have been won by internal
teams, but private contractors have penetrated to most authorities.
According to a survey of 444 councils published yesterday by the Local
Government Management Board, 60 per cent of authorities have at least one
outside contract.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Oftel takes bigger hand in BT pricing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT'S NEW price control regime, announced yesterday by Oftel, the
telecommunications regulator, involves tightening of the overall price
formula and greater intervention in elements of price control.
The main features are that from next year BT will be required to cut the
price of a basket of its main services by 7.5 percentage points less than
the rate of inflation each year. This RPI minus 7.5 formula compares with
the present formula of RPI minus 6.25, which itself has been tightened from
RPI minus 3 at the time of BT's privatisation in 1984 and RPI minus 4.5 in
1989.
The tighter price formula, to last four years, is designed to bring BT's
profitability - as measured by return on the capital employed - down to
between 16.5 per cent and 18.5 per cent in 1997. Oftel has assumed that BT
will be able to improve efficiency, as measured by real unit costs, by 3 per
cent a year.
The basket includes domestic and international call charges and line rental.
Connection charges are included in the main basket for the first time. They
were previously controlled separately, and increases were limited to RPI
plus 2.
BT will not be allowed to increase the price of any single service - apart
from line rental charges - by more than the RPI. The company was previously
free to increase some prices faster than inflation provided it made
compensating cuts to other prices. Special discounts from BT, mainly to
business customers, will not be included in the price formula.
BT will be allowed to increase line rental charges by RPI plus 2, but that
is much less than the company had been hoping for. It argued that, in order
to cover the losses it says it makes from supplying customers with lines, it
should be allowed to increase such charges by RPI plus 8.
Oftel has been concerned, however, to protect residential customers, for
whom rental charges form a large portion of bills. It has also ordered BT to
cut connection charges to Pounds 99 from the present Pounds 152.75 - a move
that will cost the company Pounds 28.5m a year.
In a further move to benefit small customers, Oftel wants BT to improve its
discounts for low users. The new scheme should benefit 4m to 5m people
compared with the 1m in the present scheme at a cost to BT of Pounds 50m a
year.
Private circuits, which are used by large businesses, will remain covered by
a separate price cap of RPI plus 0.
BT will be required to publish separate accounts for its main businesses as
a means of helping competitors get access to its network on fair terms.
Oftel plans to appoint consultants to advise it on the best way of doing so,
with the aim of BT publishing its first separate accounts in the 1993-94
financial year.
BT will be required to modernise its network so that digital services, such
as itemised billing and call barring, are available to 99 per cent of
customers by July 1997. By the same date, the company must have installed
3.5m km of fibre-optic cable, compared with the present 2m km.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Botnar retains shares 'control' court is told
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR OCTAV BOTNAR, chair-man and managing director of Nissan UK, settled his
shares in the company in a charitable trust some years ago but 'does retain
the voting control of that holding', Mr Michael Hunt, Nissan UK deputy
chairman and assistant managing director, told the High Court yesterday.
He was giving evidence for the company in an action in which Mr Stan Cholaj,
a former Nissan UK assistant managing director, is suing the company for
damages of more than Pounds 1m for wrongful dismissal and breach of
contract.
Mr Hunt said in written evidence that Mr Botnar 'is personally involved in
all aspects of the business and he makes all important strategic decisions.
It is well accepted that the directors delegate their authority to Mr Botnar
to bind the company on their behalf.'
He said it was the 'personal control of Mr Botnar which distinguishes Nissan
(UK) from other companies in the motor industry. There is a lack of formal
structure and bureaucracy.'
In cross-examination, Mr Hunt said Mr Botnar was in Switzerland. A warrant
for the arrest of Mr Botnar has been issued by the Inland Revenue, and he
has submitted only written evidence.
Mr Botnar, in written evidence, said: 'Cholaj was responsible for the fleet
market as soon as he joined and he remained responsible for it throughout
his employment.'
He alleged that Mr Cholaj wanted 'to play up the secondary responsibilities'
given to him such as finance, advertising, or printing brochures, while
omitting to discuss his performance in fleet sales. He said Mr Cholaj's
allegations were 'frivolous, trivial, distorted, inaccurate'.
Commenting on one of Mr Cholaj's allegations, Mr Botnar said: 'If I asked
Cholaj to curtail a meeting, it would have been because I do not consider
lengthy and fruitless palaver of any variety to be useful for the company.'
The hearing continues today.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Safeway uses rail for store deliveries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFEWAY has become the first UK grocery retailer to introduce rail into its
store delivery systems.
Traditionally retailers have said stores and distribution centres are
inconveniently sited for rail transport, but Safeway has started using
intermodal trailers to carry wines and spirits from its bonded warehouse in
Harlow, Essex, to a new superstore at Bellshill, Lanarkshire.
Intermodal trailers are road trailers that are driven on to special rail
wagons without the need to remove wheels or use cranes. Safeway's will be
operated by Charterail, a road-rail distribution company.
Safeway is planning a national rail distribution network based on a central
warehouse in the Midlands.
Mr Lawrence Christensen, Safeway's director of distribution, said the
company was also planning a pan-European rail distribution network with the
supermarket chains Auchan in France and Albert Heijn in the Netherlands. The
companies are partners in a venture to rationalise European sourcing.

<TEXT>
BUSINESSES that incur penalties for failing to file their accounts on time
with Companies House will be rapidly referred to a private debt collection
agency if they do not pay, it emerged yesterday.
From July 1 companies will be fined up to Pounds 5,000 if they do not file
accounts within the statutory period - seven months after the financial year
end for public companies and 10 months for private ones.
The Lewis Group beat Dun &amp; Bradstreet and Trade Indemnity for the contract
as collection agency to Companies House, an executive agency of the
Department of Trade and Industry. The contract comes as part of a clampdown
on late-filing companies.
Companies House has set a target of increasing the proportion of companies
that file on time from 80 per cent now to 91 per cent by 1995.
It will invoice late-filing companies for the penalties and forward
outstanding bills to Lewis after 30 days.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Water complaints up 130%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS from customers against the monopoly water companies, which are
now reporting increased profits, more than doubled last year, Ofwat, the
industry's regulator, reported yesterday.
It said it received 10,635 complaints about water companies in England and
Wales last year, a jump of 130 per cent on the 4,613 registered in 1990.
Mr Ian Byatt, Ofwat director-general, said he was concerned about the
increase, although a rise had been expected as more people became aware of
Ofwat's watchdog role.
He said there was no evidence that the sharp rise was caused by a decline in
standards, but added: 'Many customers have criticised the profits made by
water companies and complain about the large price increases.'
The report illustrates the water companies' difficulties in explaining the
price increases - which are averaging 5 percentage points above inflation
each year - in the light of their increased profits.
Mr Byatt, an interventionist regulator determined to protect the customer,
said at a London press conference that it was important for the companies to
be profitable, otherwise investors would not provide the funds essential for
completion of the Pounds 28bn capital investment programme.
He said shareholders also needed a return on their investment, but that
should not be excessive, given the low-risk nature of the industry. At
present, more than 70 per cent of profits are reinvested in the water
business to improve quality.
Complaints about charges represented about 38 per cent of the total. Billing
made up 25 per cent of complaints, and water supply matters 12 per cent. The
report shows that 15 per cent of complaints were resolved by compensation
and rebates, and a total of Pounds 841,000 was returned in compensation for
poor service.
The largest number of complaints about increased charges was in the
south-west. South West Water has been given permission by Ofwat to raise
charges by 16 per cent this year to pay for improvements to beach quality.

FT  10 JUN 92 / MPs pledge to keep up pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs FROM BOTH sides of the Commons last night stepped up the pressure on
banks and other financial institutions that benefited from dealings with
Robert Maxwell to contribute voluntarily to the pension funds he plundered.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, defended the government's
decision to limit to Pounds 2.5m the emergency aid for the pensioners.
Campaigners had welcomed Mr Lilley's statement on Monday. Many of them
believe that with its initial move the government is in effect committed to
making up whatever the shortfall turns out to be when all the recoverable
assets have been returned.
Mr Lilley said the special unit set up within the social security department
to secure voluntary contributions had already begun its work 'in embryo'.
Pressure on him to get the unit working at full strength is likely to
increase. Part of the unit's task is to remind the banks of their moral
obligations, as it emerged that Treasury ministers had no plans to become
involved in the exercise, in spite of the department's close links with the
City.
Rejecting demands by Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary,
that the government should restore the losses, he said if it did so it would
probably mean that the banks and other institutions would not contribute a
penny.
Mr Frank Field (Lab Birkenhead), who chaired the Commons social security
committee in the last parliament, agreed that if the government said it
would foot the bill, there would be few contributions from other sources.
There were cheers from the government benches when Mr Field stressed the
strong feeling on both sides of the House that the government should press
on in securing contributions from the banks and other financial
institutions.
Mr Field said: 'We will not be satisfied if, at the end of the day, those
contributions are inadequate'. Mr Lilley re-affirmed his belief that the
Pounds 2.5m would be adequate to meet the short-term needs of pensioners
until a court ruling determined how Pounds 100m assets should be distributed
among the various schemes.
Scoffing at Mr Meacher's suggestion that if the government repaid the money
in full it would be able to secure restitution from the banks, Mr Lilley
accused him of referring to an 'army of powers which probably do not exist'.
Mr Meacher said: 'There is no question that the government is responsible
both in honour and in the particular circumstances of the Maxwell scandal'.
Mr Antony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, acknowledged the
difficulty in gaining access to Maxwell assets in Liechenstein, but
emphasised the 'real prospect' that new international banking regulations
would improve the position.
A Labour motion calling on the government to provide a more realistic sum
than the Pounds 2.5m was defeated by a majority of 53 (315-262).

FT  10 JUN 92 / Economist at Bank proposes rates cuts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Mervyn King, chief economist of the Bank of England, yesterday
suggested that members of the European exchange rate mechanism could bring
their interest rates below German levels in the next year.
In remarks that will fuel hopes of reductions in UK base rates from the
present 10 per cent, he said: 'There is no reason to suppose that D-Mark
interest rates necessarily represent the floor for short-term interest rates
within a fully credible ERM.'
Prof King predicted in a lecture in Rome that 'the theoretical proposition
that D-Mark rates do not have to be the floor in the ERM will be tested
empirically over the next year'.
Whether other countries' rates could fall below D-Mark rates was 'not a
question of high theory but of practice and market expectations,' he said.
It was a mistake to blame Germany in general and the Bundesbank in
particular for high short-term interest rates in Europe. Other EMS countries
had decided to maintain unchanged parities against the D-Mark after the
shock of German unification.
'Monetary constraints on countries other than Germany have, therefore,
largely been self-imposed in order to increase credibility in the long-term
commitment of ERM countries to price stability.'
Prof King challenged the belief that high short-term rates were preventing
economic recovery in Europe. He pointed out that much investment and some
consumption depended on long-term rates, which need not be incompatible with
rapidgrowth.
Long-term rates may reflect expectations of profits from investment that
lead to higher consumption and lower saving. 'In these circumstances, higher
interest rates are a symptom of good news.'

FT  10 JUN 92 / Nuclear case to go on TV

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NUCLEAR ELECTRIC plans to use a new commercial business channel, broadcast
nationally by BBC transmitters, to promote its case for resuming nuclear
power station construction after 1994.
Mr John Collier, chairman of Nuclear Electric, part of the electricity
supply industry that was not privatised, has booked a half-hour programme to
be broadcast on July 29.
The company will pay Pounds 40,000, apart from production costs, for the
half hour of national airtime at 5.30am.
The programme will be one of the first to be broadcast on The Business
Channel - a joint venture between BMH Communications and the BBC - which
will use BBC transmitters in the early hours of the morning.
Scottish Power is to broadcast its annual meeting the day after Nuclear
Electric. Lord Young, chairman of Cable and Wireless, yesterday signed with
BMH to broadcast his company's annual meeting.
At Nuclear Electric, Mr Collier and Mr Bob Hawley, the chief executive, will
front the programme. The broadcast will include extracts from a press
conference and a briefing for City analysts on the utility's annual results.
Mr Collier will say in the meetings that Nuclear Electric has increased its
efficiency by 30 per cent over the past two years. He will argue that it is
time to consider building more nuclear power stations.
'Our greatest wish is to resume the construction programme,' Mr Collier said
yesterday. Nuclear Electric will say that it will soon be 'fit enough' to
begin expanding.
Mr Collier believes his company has a good story to tell but until now has
been considered in the City of London as 'the joker in the pack'.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Banks shelter behind trust law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KENNETH TRENCH, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, stated
confidently this week that banks and financial institutions holding some
Pounds 217m in securities belonging to the Maxwell pension funds would
return those assets.
To the Maxwell pensioners the issue seems straightforward: if a person in
possession of stolen goods can be forced to return them to their rightful
owner, the same rule must apply to banks.
Yet the banks maintain that they cannot be forced by law to return the
pension fund assets. National Westminster, which holds shares in Teva, an
Israeli pharmaceutical company, which are claimed by the funds, has said
that it has to put its shareholders' interests first and cannot return them.
Legal experts said yesterday that where assets have been transferred out of
a pension fund by its trustees, in breach of the terms of the trust deed,
different rules apply to individuals and to banks in receipt of those
assets.
If the trustees had paid out money to an individual not entitled to it, for
example by paying a pension to someone who had never worked for a Maxwell
company, they could demand repayment on the grounds that it had been paid by
mistake in breach of trust.
Banks, however, are able to avoid having to repay the money providing they
can show they gave value in return for it. Even if it is stolen and has been
paid in breach of trust, they can avoid repayment if they can show that they
are 'bona fide purchasers for value without notice'.
In the Maxwell case, therefore, if the banks can show they acted in good
faith; gave value for the money by, for example, granting a loan to Mr
Maxwell or one of his companies; and they had no knowledge that the money
had been paid in breach of trust, then they cannot be required to repay it.
The crucial issue in the Maxwell case will be whether the banks had notice
that the assets were paid out of the pension funds in breach of trust.
The banks will argue that they were told the assets belonged to Mr Maxwell,
or one of his companies, and had no means of knowing that they belonged to
the pension funds.
The pension trustees, in the form of the liquidator of Bishopsgate
Investment Management, will argue that while the banks may not have had
actual notice, they did have constructive notice that the money came from
the funds.
In other words, if they had asked the questions they should have asked, they
would have known the true position.

   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International were
warned yesterday by its majority shareholder to accept the provisional
liquidation plan or risk ending up with nothing.
At the second day of a hearing in the High Court to determine whether to
ratify the proposal, the government of Abu Dhabi, which owns more than 70
per cent of BCCI, said the proposed pay-out to creditors was 'not open to
renegotiation'.
The eight-strong creditors' committee has objected to the plan announced by
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm, in February. It includes compensation of
Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 926m) for creditors.
Touche Ross says creditors will eventually receive between 30 per cent and
40 per cent of money owed to them by BCCI. The creditors' committee said the
pay-out would be nearer 15 per cent to 17 per cent.
The committee representing former employees of BCCI, who argue that they
have been neglected, called for further time to negotiate on the settlement.
The hearing is expected to continue at least until tomorrow

FT  10 JUN 92 / Senior executives deny Pounds 14m Eagle Trust theft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than Pounds 14m was stolen from Eagle Trust, the Midlands
mini-conglomerate, by former senior executives after the company's 1987
rights issue failed following the stock market crash, Wolverhampton Crown
Court heard yesterday.
The money was laundered through offshore companies before being used to help
repay the Pounds 15m underwriting commitment entered into by Mr John
Ferriday, the former Eagle Trust chief executive, Mr John Rogers QC said.
When shares in Eagle Trust were suspended in May 1989, it was suspected that
a fraud had taken place that had left the company insolvent.
'Those suspicions were justified,' Mr Rogers said. 'For more than 12 months
there had been substantial thefts of money and other assets belonging to the
company by senior employees.'
He was opening the prosecution brought by the Serious Fraud Office against
Mr Ferriday; Mr Richard Smith, a former Eagle Trust managing director; Mr
Martin Baker, a former Eagle Trust finance director; and Mr Leslie Goodwin,
a former chairman of Connect Parcels, a delivery company.
Mr Ferriday faces 11 charges including the theft of Pounds 12.25m and Pounds
1.7m in shares, false accounting and providing false information. Mr Smith
faces four charges of theft involving Pounds 11.5m and one of deception. Mr
Baker faces four theft charges involving Pounds 12.25m. Mr Goodwin faces two
theft charges involving Pounds 11.5m and one of providing false information.
All deny the charges.
The fraud took place after Eagle Trust's takeover bid in October 1987 for
the Samuelson group, a supplier of photographic equipment, Mr Rogers said.
Eagle Trust made a shares-and-cash offer for the company supported by a
rights issue to raise extra money. However, the stock market crash of
Oct-ober led to the Eagle Trust share price falling from 30p to 20p.
Samuelson shareholders chose the cash option, while the rights issue failed.
Mr Ferriday was left with a personal sub-underwriting commitment of Pounds
15m, Mr Rogers said.
The fraud centred on three thefts, he continued. In December 1987, Pounds
13.5m was stolen from the company by Mr Ferriday and Mr Smith. They were
assisted by Mr Baker and Mr Goodwin, who passed the money through Connect
Parcels. The money then passed through two offshore companies before being
returned to the UK to help pay off Mr Ferriday's debt.
In January 1988, Mr Ferriday stole shares in the Howden engineering group
worth Pounds 3m from Eagle Trust, Mr Rogers said. In the autumn of 1988,
helped by Mr Baker, Mr Ferriday stole a further Pounds 1.25m from Eagle
Trust, he added.
The trial is expected to last about six months.

FT  10 JUN 92 / DTI held up probe to let SFO act
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE appointment of Depart-ment of Trade and Industry inspectors to
investigate the Maxwell companies was delayed until the Serious Fraud Office
told officials of the direction its inquiry was taking into the affair, it
emerged yesterday.
It was not until two weeks ago - more than a year after the flotation of
Mirror Group Newspapers and seven months after Robert Maxwell died - that Mr
Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, decided the time was right.
Gathered with Mr Heseltine in his office were Mr Vivian Brown, head of the
DTI's investigations division, and Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs
minister. In front of them was a proposal for action.
The SFO inquiries would not encompass the extent to which company law may
have been breached during the MGN flotation in May last year, the report
said. That justified appointing DTI inspectors. The two ministers and Mr
Brown agreed.
An announcement was delayed to coincide with the Department of Social
Security announcement on Monday of an independent review of pension law.
Part of the value of launching an investigation, particularly when political
pressure is growing at Westminster, is the impression given of a government
acting on as many fronts as possible.
The DTI had been anxious to build its case carefully. Officials were
concerned about the cost - appointing inspectors can involve millions of
pounds - and the consequences of a wrong decision, both for the company and
for the DTI's reputation.
The official argument until this week - including under the tenure of Mr
Peter Lilley, former trade and industry secretary - was that there was no
point in the DTI's organising an investigation that might clash with that of
the SFO.
DTI officials meet the SFO formally four times a year, but are in closer
contact informally.
The timing of the appointment of DTI inspectors into the Maxwell affair was
 -according to insiders - therefore not a question of Mr Heseltine shaking
the department into action.
The argument being spread around Whitehall yesterday was that it was simply
propitious.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Unions recover Pounds 360m a year damages, TUC says
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAMAGES WON by unions for their members amount to about Pounds 360m a year,
considerably higher than previous estimates of Pounds 150m to Pounds 200m,
according to a Trades Union Congress survey.
The findings, which will be presented to the TUC's social, health and
environmental protection committee today, underline the growing importance
of legal services to unions and their members. Most awards arise from cases
involving personal injury.
Legal services appear to be cost-effective - the TUC estimates that unions
spent a total of Pounds 20m last year on legal action.
A survey of 10 unions, representing 2.75m people, produced a figure of
Pounds 122m for last year which, a report for today's committee says,
represents Pounds 44.35 a member, or more than Pounds 360m a year if it is
applied to the whole TUC membership.
A recent survey for the Labour Research Department found that unions spent
Pounds 11m a year and recovered Pounds 190m. One member in 44 made direct
use of his or her union's legal services and average compensation was Pounds
1,174.
Labour Research found that the highest rate of return in legal services was
achieved by the TGWU general union, which secured Pounds 83.83 for each
Pounds 1 spent. The rail union RMT recovered Pounds 61.73 for each Pounds 1
spent.
The GPMU print union is credited with the highest compensation per case, at
Pounds 5,026.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Companies warned on accounting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES must state clearly in their annual reports any divergence from UK
accounting standards, the Financial Reporting Review Panel, the accounting
watchdog, warned yesterday.
Mr Edwin Glasgow QC, panel chairman, said the law required a clear,
unambiguous statement of compliance with the standards or any reasons for
departures from them.
He said some companies had used unacceptable phrases, such as compliance

FT  10 JUN 92 / Maxwell pensioners criticise City firms: Lilley defends
Pounds 2.5m emergency aid limit - Campaigners confident on return of assets
/ Delay in appointing inspectors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO PROMINENT city firms should have suspected in the year before Robert
Maxwell's death that they were aiding in the disappearance of securities
under their control, according to a High Court writ.
By late 1990, the writ alleges, the two firms knew or ought to have known
that transactions involving the securities had put the interests of
pensioners at risk. In spite of that, the writ alleges, the firms failed to
inform either pension fund trustees or regulators about those matters. In
the interim the securities were used as collateral for loans to Maxwell's
private interests.
The writ, filed last week, seeks Pounds 88m from the fund managers as well
as from Lehman Brothers and Credit Suisse, two investment banks that
received the securities allegedly stolen from the MGN pension scheme.
The writ, from the present trustees of the Mirror Group Newspapers pension
scheme, alleges that Invesco MIM and Capel-Cure Myers (CCM) failed to alert
either pension fund trustees or regulators. Instead, they sought assurances
from the people who gave the instructions that their activities were proper,
the writ says.
The two fund managers were allegedly told to hand over the pension scheme's
shares portfolios to two other Maxwell-owned fund managers to be used for
what was described as stock lending. The writs allege that the fund managers
acted on instructions from people who had no authority to order stock
lending and that all signs pointed to stock lending of a highly irregular
nature.
The document for the first time spells out in explicit detail just how the
theft of assets from the pension funds was allegedly effected.
It claims that, as early as October 18 1990, MIM must have had suspicions
about the stock lending it was being asked to undertake because it wrote to
London and Bishopsgate International Investment Management (LBI) asking to
be released from all responsibility for the securities while they were in
LBI's care.
The writ says that on October 26 MIM's suspicions should have been further
aroused because it learned that loaned securities, originally made out in
favour of Bishopsgate Investment Management (another Maxwell fund manager),
had been returned without being made out in the name of the borrower, as is
the usual practice.
The writ says: 'The plaintiff will contend that MIM knew at all material
times after October 26 1990 that legitimate stock lending was not being
undertaken by BIM or LBI and that therefore the delivered MIM portfolio was
at risk.'
Then, the writ says, at a meeting with several MGN pension trustees on
December 3 1990, MIM was told stock lending would end and securities would
be returned. But on December 18, in a letter from Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr
Trevor Cook, secretary to the scheme, MIM was allegedly told lending would
be extended to the end of January.
Each month thereafter, MIM allegedly received a letter saying lending would
be extended for yet one more month, that trustees were very happy with the
stock lending programme and that hefty fees were being earned. The writ says
that the fees were never passed on to MIM and were far larger than could
have been earned through conventional stock lending activities.
By April last year, it is alleged, MIM was so worried about stock lending
that its compliance officer sought an outside legal opinion on the matter.
An internal meeting was held that month, the writ claims, at which MIM
officials recorded concerns that stocks were not being loaned through a
conventional money broker. By August 15 1991, MIM allegedly knew that the
assets it had passed to LBI for stock lending had been used as collateral -
knowledge which the writ says should have tipped it off to the fact that its
securities had been pledged as security for loans to a third party.
The allegations against CCM follow a similar pattern. On October 8 1990, CCM
was allegedly instructed by BIM and LBI to deliver a portfolio of stocks
directly to Lehman Brothers. The writ says that because conventional stock
lending must be conducted through recognised money brokers, CCM should have
been suspicious. It says: 'CCM was aware that the delivery of the delivered
CCM portfolio to Lehmans was to be used as 'loan collateral', which was
plainly an improper purpose . . .'
Indeed, the writ alleges, by December 12 1990, CCM's own file notes refer to
the fact that it knew securities were being used as loan collateral.
Lehman Brothers said it accepted the securities in good faith and intends to
contest the writ. Invesco MIM said it believed at all times that it was
following instructions of all the MGN pension-scheme trustees. The other two
firms declined to comment.

ENGINEERING companies in Scotland reported a modest rise in optimism
yesterday. The intake of orders and capital investment had increased, with
the electronics industry and medium-sized engineering companies reporting
growth while heavy engineering had a drop in orders, James Buxton writes.
Scottish Engineering, which published its quarterly survey for the three
months to June of its 300 members as well as some electronics companies that
are not members, said the survey showed a 'positive move out of the depths
of recession across the industry'.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Receivers blame move by Libya for failure of AWD
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN UNDISCLOSED deal to supply 2,000 trucks to Libya, which the country
failed to complete, was primarily responsible for AWD, the former Bedford
trucks business, going into receivership last week.
When Libya did not sign a Pounds 117m letter of credit, it was 'the straw
which broke the camel's back', joint receivers Mr Tony Thompson and Mr Roger
Oldfield, of accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, acknowledged yesterday.
Intermediaries between Libya and the company say they believe the reasons
for the Libyans' failure to complete the deal are political. But they have
not been able to establish whether it represents retaliation by the
country's ruler, Col Muammer Gadaffi, against United Nations sanctions.
These were imposed in April because of Libya's refusal to hand over for
trial two men suspected of involvement in the Lockerbie bombing.
Under the agreement, Libya was to have taken delivery of the 2,000 trucks
within a 12-month period starting this year. It would have thrown a lifeline
to AWD, most of whose workforce had been idle since January as a result of
the recession in the UK truck market and the failure to complete another
large foreign supply agreement - 2,000 trucks for Iran.
AWD's management called in the receivers last week. The company, based in
Dunstable, Bedfordshire, and controlled by Mr David JB Brown, the
entrepreneur, and his family, is understood to owe its bank and other
creditors about Pounds 50m.
Truck production is being resumed at the plant today, but at a much reduced
level and with only 150 employees. The other 502 were made redundant on
Monday.
The Iranian deal, first announced last November, was said to be worth Pounds
70m to AWD. It is now known that AWD's directors were hoping that deal would
maintain the company's viability until the Libyan contract came on stream.
All the trucks would have been built at Dunstable, with the Iranian project
involving neither local assembly nor AWD taking an equity stake in an
assembly joint venture.
The receivers say several 'substantial' companies are interested in buying
AWD as a going concern.
Mr Thompson said that the Iranian deal was 'still close to completion' and
that the Libyans 'still apparently want to do a deal'.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Investment regulation criticised: Reports from OFT say
commissions paid to sales agents could distort advice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO INDEPENDENT reports published yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading
contain the disquieting conclusions that investors know too little about the
financial products they buy to make a sensible choice and that commissions
paid to sales agents could distort investment advice.
The reports' broader finding is that competition in the marketplace for
financial services is not working in the interest of the consumer.
The reports are fiercely critical of the regulation of retail investments.
The OFT asked two consumer affairs consultants, Mr Jeremy Mitchell and Ms
Helena Wiesner, for separate reports. Both found there were 'market
failures' in financial services, resulting from public ignorance and the
commissions paid to intermediaries.
One report said: 'A commission-based remuneration system poses substantial
conflicts of interest for intermediaries and can have a deleterious effect
on the type of product a consumer is advised to buy, and for independent
financial advisers, also on the company from which that product is bought.'
It also criticised the scope of retail regulation, and the fact that
building societies are not regulated under the Financial Services Act.
If the OFT accepted the reports' conclusions Sir Gordon Borrie, the
director-general of fair trading, would be brought into conflict with the
Securities and Investments Board, which regulates most of the financial
services industry.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, would then be called on to make a final
decision. The OFT stressed, however, that the reports were aimed at
'stimulating discussion'. The reports had revealed much useful information.
SIB announced last month it would not force independent financial advisers
to reveal the commissions they received from investment companies in cash
terms at point of sale.
It also allowed life companies to quote illustrations for potential buyers
on the assumption that their costs were in line with the industry average -
even if their expenses were much higher.
Both decisions are attacked in the OFT's reports, which said: 'Clear
information about costs and other features of the product or service are
essential. This is patently not the case as far as the provision of
independent advice is concerned.'
When Sir David Walker, out-going chairman of SIB, announced the results of
his review, he admitted he disagreed with Sir Gordon on commission
disclosure. He added: 'Ultimately, if he persists in his view, and I persist
in mine, then we will have to leave ministers to decide.'
The OFT will be unable to act until SIB's proposed rules have been fully
drafted, which will probably not be until the end of next month.
Mr Mitchell, a former director of the National Consumer Council and director
of consumer affairs at the OFT, and Ms Wiesner, a director of the Life
Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Office (Lautro), agree on several
points:
Levels of commission may influence the advice of salesmen. That is
illustrated by growth in the sale of endowment mortgages, which pay a
commission not available for standard repayment mortgages. In 1970,
endowments accounted for 6.7 per cent of mortgages and repayments for 88 per
cent. In 1990, endowments took 75 per cent of mortgages and repayments only
20 per cent.
The drive by life companies to secure sales outlets, particularly with
building societies, has pushed up commission levels. 'Tied agency' deals, in
which a building society sells only the products of one life office, have
proved very popular. Only two large building societies, Bradford &amp; Bingley
and Yorkshire, remain independent in that respect.
According to Ms Wiesner's report, Halifax Building Society, which is tied to
Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, received Pounds 162m in
commission in 1990 - 16 per cent of income and 27 per cent of profits.
Since 1989, the share taken by commission from a 10-year endowment policy
has risen by 27 per cent for independents and 47 per cent for tied agents.
According to Lautro's last commission survey, the highest commission paid on
a Pounds 50-a-month, 25-year endowment policy with a tied agent was Pounds
642. High turnover of sales staff may have implications for their training
and competence. On average, 38 per cent of new sales recruits to life
insurance companies leave within a year and 54 per cent leave within two.
One office, Provident Mutual, loses 90 per cent of recruits in two years.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Big business not big on Perot: Critics, worry about personal
qualities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON and LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THEY WERE only throwaway answers to a hypothetical question, but they
pointed up a distinct lack of enthusiasm within American big business for
Texas billionaire Ross Perot's putative presidential candidacy.
Executives from leading US companies at a conference in Virginia were asked
what they would say to the independent Perot, one of the country's most
successful entrepreneurs, if he won November's election and asked them for
advice.
'Resign,' shot back Mr Howard Allen, former chief executive of Southern
California Edison, one of the nation's largest producers of electricity. The
response of Mr Robert Allen, chairman of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph, was
more guarded but still barbed: 'It would be refreshing,' he said, 'to hear
Ross ask for some advice.'
Mr Perot's populism may be wowing the electorate from California to the
Carolinas and picking up support from small business, but the nation's
biggest companies are sticking firmly to their traditional backing of the
Republican party, which means supporting President George Bush.
A recent poll of 115 chief executives by Fortune magazine found that 78 per
cent would vote to return Mr Bush to the White House, with a mere 11 per
cent favouring Mr Perot and 4 per cent Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton, the
Democratic party's candidate.
At first glance this might seem surprising, given that US businessmen often
grumble that one of their number could surely do better than professional
politicians in breaking through Washington's habitual policy-making
gridlock. Indeed, Fortune found that 65 per cent of respondents felt a
business executive would make a good president.
But many believe that Mr Perot is singularly lacking in the personal
qualities needed to negotiate a path through the capital's warring interest
groups and entrenched bureaucracy.
They acknowledge that Mr Perot is a brilliant salesman (which would come in
handy wooing votes in congress) and that he has shown throughout his career
the rare ability to cut to the heart of complex issues, take rapid and
decisive action, and elicit extraordinary personal loyalty.
On the other hand, they worry about his reputation for dictatorial business
behaviour, for reducing arguments to overly simplified black-and-white, and
for deciding on a course while refusing to listen to contrary advice.
This mix of qualities may have been vital to his success: his single-minded
drive and self-confidence was certainly there when he quit as a top salesman
for International Business Machines in the early 1960s and founded
Electronic Data Systems (EDS), the computer services group which made his
fortune. However, his critics argue that the qualities of a successful
entrepreneur are not necessarily those needed to run a huge corporate
bureaucracy, let alone a government machine which sees politicians come and
go and which has countless ways to frustrate commands.
'Politics requires compromise, and nothing in Perot's background suggests he
is prepared to do that,' said a leading Wall Street figure who asked not to
be named. 'He's shown no evidence of being able to handle people who do not
share his views. I don't think he'd make a very good president.'
There are businessmen who believe Mr Perot's qualities are exactly what is
needed in Washington: Mr Alan 'Ace' Greenberg, chairman of investment bank
Bear Stearns, says: 'I've known Ross for 10 years. I like him. I think he's
brilliant. He's who I want for president.'
But many critics home in on Mr Perot's battle with General Motors - the
closest thing to a government bureaucracy that you will find in US business
 -as an example of the problems he would face in the White House.
After selling EDS to GM, Mr Perot joined the motor company's board and tried
to help stem its long decline in the face of Japanese competition. He
quickly and acutely identified many of the company's problems but then
antagonised much of middle and senior management with his blunt exposition
of their errors, while failing to rally his boardroom colleagues to his
cause.
A frustrated Mr Perot was eased off the board, and GM deferred many
fundamental reforms until its non-executive directors staged a more subtle
boardroom revolt.
Personal qualities apart, many top businessmen say it is hard to judge Mr
Perot's candidacy until he starts giving a clear idea of where he stands on
policy. 'All he's done so far is make some general statements it is hard to
disagree with,' one chairman points out.
None of this is likely to worry the iconoclastic Perot, who often makes
clear his contempt for corporate bureaucrats and chief executives with
'their blow-dried hair, their Dollars 3,000 suits and their 23-year-old
trophy wives'. Last week he dismissed US big business as part of the
establishment and said that the future lay with small business which, he
said, was at the moment being starved of credit.
Anecdotal evidence suggests that small business views Mr Perot as a role
model and enthusiastically supports his candidacy.
Mr Todd Mason, author of an unauthorised biography of Mr Perot, points out
that he has frequently timed important events in his life - marriage, the
founding of EDS, its sale - to occur on his birthday, June 27. It is
conceivable he will use the occasion, now only about two weeks away, to
announce his formal candidacy. However, if he does, not many top businessmen
are likely to send congratulations.
IN contrast to a general lack of enthusiasm for Mr Ross Perot's presidential
candidacy among most business leaders, executives at US high-technology
companies strongly support his campaign, writes Louise Kehoe in San
Francisco.
According to a survey published this week by the American Electronics
Association, a trade group representing more than 3,000 US high-tech
companies, 55 per cent of the 408 chief executives who responded named Mr
Perot as their preferred candidate. President George Bush won 29 per cent,
Governor Bill Clinton only 4 per cent.
Mr Richard Iverson, AEA president and chief executive, said: 'I believe the
poll results reflect the current preferences of executives across the
spectrum of the US electronics industry.'
Mr Perot's appeal to electronics executives is not surprising, as he is
regarded in the industry as one of its own 'self-made men'.
He is viewed as an entrepreneur who ploughed some of his wealth back into
the industry through investments in start-up companies such as Next
Computer, led by Mr Steve Jobs, the co-founder of Apple Computer.
Mr Perot's tough line on Japanese trade is also well received in the
electronics industry. His call for a 'level playing field' echoes the
sentiments of US semiconductor and computer industry executives.

FT  10 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Compromise on aid cash eludes officials at
Rio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor and CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE Earth Summit runs into its final days, there is no doubt as to what
is the crunch issue: money. Everyone agrees that billions of dollars of aid
will be needed to make the summit agreements effective because most of the
clean-up work is in the third world. But who will provide it, and on what
terms?
Officials were engaged in a hectic round of meetings yesterday to try to
resolve the wide disagreements. If they fail, the matter will be put before
ministers today. And if they fail, it will be up to heads of state to find
an answer when they convene on Friday.
The main points at issue are:
how much money will be made available;
how big a long-term commitment the rich countries will make;
how it will be provided.
The UN estimated that Dollars 625bn (Pounds 343.4bn) a year would be needed
by third world countries, of which they would have to provide Dollars 500bn
themselves. The remaining Dollars 125bn would come from an existing Dollars
55bn of aid plus Dollars 70bn in new money. This last sum is what all the
wrangling is about. Industrial countries have agreed in principle to advance
'new and additional funds' - but not in the amounts suggested.
Mr Mahbubul Haq, the former Pakistani finance minister and now a UN adviser,
argues that the industrial countries will have a 'peace dividend' of Dollars
1,200bn over the next 10 years which could be re-channelled into the
environment. Alternatively a carbon tax of Dollars 1 per barrel would raise
Dollars 40bn.
The G7 industrialised countries had hoped to leave Rio without having to
make binding commitments, but political pressure is now such that they will
have to put hard money on the table. The best estimate at the moment is that
they will come up with between Dollars 5bn and Dollars 10bn, but much will
depend on Japan.
Tokyo's foreign aid currently runs at about Dollars 11bn a year. It has also
spent just over Dollars 2bn on environmental aid since 1990. Japanese
officials are suggesting that the total foreign aid sum might be increased
by 50-75 per cent, with a larger chunk being allocated to the environment.
However, a senior Japanese official says: 'It's still a fight between the
Foreign Ministry and the Finance Ministry.'
The other big demand is that the developed countries commit themselves to
channelling 0.7 per cent of their GNP into aid. This is almost double the
proportion most countries give in assistance, although some smaller European
countries are at that level. The Group of 77 developing countries want
developed nations to commit themselves to reaching that level by the year
2000, but the G7 rules this out.
There does not, therefore, seem to be any chance of their making a long-term
aid commitment in Rio.
As for the means by which aid will be advanced, the developing countries
have been demanding a multi-billion dollar 'green fund'. The donor countries
have insisted that any aid linked to the Earth Summit treaties be channelled
through the Global Environmental Facility administered by the UN and the
World Bank. But they have agreed to make the GEF more 'democratic' by giving
recipient countries a greater say in how its money is spent.
The money issue is being thrashed out in a contact group headed by Mr Rubens
Ricupero, the Brazilian ambassador to Washington. He put forward a working
paper to try to forge agreement. This proposed what Mr Ricupero called a
'system' of financing that would draw on all existing aid channels, regional
development banks, the GEF and UN agencies, as well as special measures like
debt relief and private investment.
The paper deliberately avoids hard money numbers. The only proposal
containing actual numbers that has so far been put forward is the EC's.
France has suggested that the EC commit Ecu3bn (Pounds 2.1bn) over the next
three to five years for environmental aid. This would be in addition to
whatever sums member states pledge individually.
Mr Ricupero is hoping donors will commit themselves to 'orders of
magnitude'; one western official estimated that the measures would imply aid
of Dollars 6bn-Dollars 9bn.
His initiative has made virtually no progress, however.
Members of Europe's leading non-governmental organisations (NGOs) last night
met Euroepan environment ministers at the summit to call for stronger action
on forest destruction and a commitment to work towards a worldwide forest
convention, reports Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
With only one day of working group discussions left it seems unlikely there
will be any agreement on deforestation, which is continuing at a rate of 17m
hectares a year.
Mr Andrew Lees from Friends of the Earth said there was a danger the summit
was losing sight of vital environmental problems because so much was being
negotiated simultaneously in Rio.

treaty

THE UK is to sign the Earth Summit's convention on biological diversity, or
species protection, but with a declaration on its own interpretation of the
question of financial commitments, Prime Minister John Major said yesterday.
In a written statement at Westminster, Mr Major told MPs that signing the
convention would be subject 'to satisfactory arrangements that take full
account of our concern about financial commitments'.
His comment that it would provide 'an initial step in protecting natural
habitats and the range of species throughout the world' was less
enthusiastic than the comments about the climate change convention which the
UK has joined other European Community members in urging other countries to
sign.
The UK's decision to sign leaves the US as the only significant country
refusing to initial the treaty, with no change in its position in view.
Japan, which also had worries, is expected to sign.
US administration officials said they saw no hope of winning changes to the
biodiversity convention that would persuade them to sign.
They said the convention's provisions on intellectual property would undo
two years of painful negotiations on the same subject in the Uruguay Round
of Gatt.
The UK's worries centred on the possibility that aid commitments to
developing countries contained in the treaty could amount to richer
countries signing a blank cheque. However, Mr Michael Howard, the UK
environment secretary, said in Rio: 'We believe we have found a way round
these difficulties.'
The US also repeated yesterday that it had problems with the Rio
Declaration, the summit centrepiece due to be signed by all leaders on
Saturday. The US said it might not subscribe to this statement of
environmental principles.
Side declarations have provided a useful way out for countries which want to
sign the treaties, but need to express reservations. The EC countries
announced yesterday they would make an accompanying statement to the climate
change convention which restates their determination to reduce carbon
emissions to their 1990 levels by 2000.

associates at International Signal &amp; Control (ISC), the Lancaster,
Pennsylvania, company that he founded and in 1987 sold to Ferranti of the

Mr Guerin said some of the lies included misleading fellow executives about
alleged US government approval for the covert shipment in 1980 of US
military technologies.
He faces a possible prison sentence of between 30 years and life.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Bush may soon join rivals on chat shows
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush may soon join Governor Bill Clinton and Mr Ross Perot,
his rivals for the presidency, on the radio and television talk show
circuit, according to rumours swirling around Washington this week.
This would represent a substantial tactical shift for Mr Bush who said only
last week that he would wait until after the Republican convention in August
before engaging in formal full-time campaigning. Even then, he implied he
would shun what has become, thanks to Mr Perot, the most popular form of
political communication this year.
However, the president last week entertained as an overnight guest in the
White House Mr Rush Limbaugh, an abrasive and generally conservative radio
talk show host. No official word of the discussion has emerged, but it may
be assumed he was trying to impress Mr Limbaugh and, by extension, his
audience.
The president had been frustrated last week when the three main commercial
networks refused to carry live his prime time news conference on the grounds
that it might amount to no more than free political air time. Talk and
celebrity shows, on the other hand, actively compete for prominent guests.
The need for both Mr Bush and Mr Clinton to reach out more to the general
public was reinforced by another poll yesterday, by the Washington Post and
ABC. This not only had Mr Perot in the lead with 38 per cent to the
president's 30 per cent and Mr Clinton's 26 per cent, but found Mr Bush's
overall approval rating, at 35 per cent, dropping to an historic low.
Yesterday morning, Mr Clinton sought to relaunch his struggling campaign
further by answering viewer's questions for an hour on NBC's breakfast time
'Today' programme.
Mr Clinton said that talk shows could both help and harm; they could help if
they eased popular frustration with 'the artificial nature of politics', but
harm if they merely encouraged greater 'cynicism'. It was most important, he
said, for people to be able to distinguish between good and bad public
service.
But the medium does not make it easy to get that message over in any detail.
In his hour yesterday, reduced to under 50 minutes by station and commercial
breaks, Mr Clinton responded to 25 questions, covering the full range from
veterans' benefits to Haiti. All his answers were of necessity truncated.
The callers had been screened for balance by the programme's producers,
which probably explained why only two questions were specifically about the
threat of Mr Perot. At Mr Bush's press conference last week, at which
reporters could ask what they liked, about half were about the prospective
independent candidate.

<TEXT>
CHIEF executives of most of the largest banks in India met the governor of
the central bank, Mr S. Venkitaraman, yesterday to agree to an overhaul of
the country's interbank market in the wake of the Rs30.8bn (Pounds 600m)
Bombay stock market fraud disclosed in recent weeks.
Sweeping changes , proposed in a report last week by Mr R. Janakiraman, the
bank's deputy governor, have been agreed, including the separation of banks'
securities activities into three units: investment management, record
keeping and safe-keeping of securities.
Failure to separate these functions has made it easier for executives in
some of the country's largest banks to generate fictitious deals and divert
money from the market.
'Everyone wants a market place that reduces risk,' said one chief executive
present at the meeting.
Mr Venkitaraman is to travel to London this week for a meeting of central
bank governors, and expects to meet the chairman of Standard Chartered, the
UK-based international bank that has total exposure of Rs10.55bn (Pounds
195m) in the affair.
Standard Chartered is understood to hold 15 trunkloads of securities lodged
with it by Mr Hiten Dalal, one of the brokers who has been named in the
affair.
The bank is still in the process of itemising these piles of shares, public
sector bonds and other securities, and has yet to put a total value on them.
However, it believes they will cover a substantial part of its exposure.
All the assets of Mr Dalal and others named in the affair were impounded on
Monday by Mr A K Menon, the custodian appointed by the government to recover
money lost by the banks.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA'S Congress party received a boost to its morale yesterday when it
seemed certain of regaining a key parliamentary seat in a by-election in New
Delhi.
Mr Rajesh Khanna, the Congress candidate and a star of Hindi films, seemed
assured of a comfortable victory in a seat which Mr L K Advani, the
Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP), leader had won in the general election last
year. Mr Advani had to vacate the constituency because he took another seat
in Gujarat.
The result comes at a time when Congress feels on the defensive both because
of continuing high inflation and because of the Bombay stock market scandal.
It suggests, however, that Congress is still winning back voters who turned
to the BJP in the last election out of weariness for the Congress party.
The Congress victory in New Delhi is part of a trend reflected in scattered
local elections this year. Last month Congress defeated the BJP in municipal
corporation elections in Simla - the capital of the Himalayan hill state
where the BJP is in power. Congress in February also scored a strong victory
over the BJP in municipal by-elections in Bombay in February.
The New Delhi by-election was one of two for which voting took place on
Monday. At the same time 13 state assembly seats were being contested.
Voting in Delhi aroused little enthusiasm though there was widespread
violence.

THE Swiss-Swedish group Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) has been commissioned to

in Western Australia.
The 600 MW plant in Collie in the state's south-west region will be the
first big privately-funded and owned power station in Australia. Much of the
funding is due to be raised through the issue of infrastructure bonds, which
attract concessional tax rates.
The plant was to have been developed by a syndicate led by Australia's
Transfield Group and Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation. A mandate was awarded
in October, but withdrawn in April when Mitsubishi Transfield failed to
raise funding at rates that would deliver the promised prices.

<TEXT>
MRS CARLA HILLS, the US trade representative, yesterday released a list of
Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.08bn) worth of EC products potentially targeted for
high import tariffs in retaliation for the loss of European market share by
US soyabean producers.
'We have gone the extra mile, patiently pursuing this issue through the
General Agreement for Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) for five years,' she said in
an accompanying statement.
'However, in light of the magnitude of trade harm the US is suffering, I
have no choice but to prepare a commensurate trade action.'
The list - probably the largest ever compiled for a trade action - included:
EC wines, cheeses, beers, meat products, seafood, breads, vegetables, gin,
vermouth, brandy, whiskey, unmanufactured tobacco, animal feed, cut flowers,
vegetables and cooking oils.
The US trade representative will now hear public comment for at least 30
days before paring the list of targets from Dollars 2bn to Dollars 1bn and
putting the sanctions in effect.
Two dispute settlement panels in the Gatt have found the EC at fault for
subsidies of its oilseeds sector. EC subsidy schemes have boosted domestic
output of oilseeds by more than 10m tonnes since the early 1980s.
The EC has said it plans to offer compensation to the US, as well as
Argentina and Brazil, but the Bush administration is being urged by the farm
lobby to accept no settlement that does not benefit the soyabean producers.

<TEXT>
The Serbian president, Mr Slobodan Milosevic, yesterday faced a rebellion
within his ruling Socialist Party from opponents who accused him of serious
misrule culminating in the United Nations trade and oil embargo.
Their move coincided with more street battles in the Bosnian capital,
Sarajevo, where many residents, including Serbs, face starvation.
The split in Mr Milosevic's party was led by 12 socialist deputies in the
Serbian parliament who said they would leave the party of ex-communists and
set up their own political organisation unless there were fundamental
changes. 'We hope above all to bring about changes within the party, or to
be more specific, changes to the party's direction,' Mr Jovan Cvetkovic, one
of the rebel deputies, told Tanjug news agency.
The deputies criticised the party for the way it hastily created a new
Yugoslav state in April, its poor handling of the crisis and its relations
with the dispirited federal army and the opposition.
In Sarajevo, fighting broke out towards midday after Serb forces held their
fire during the night. Residents described the renewed fighting as
intermittent shelling, less intense than on Monday when Sarajevo's Moslem,
Serb and Croat defenders, defying a two-month siege by Serb irregulars,
staged their first counter-offensive after three days of blistering Serb
bombardments.

'I have been unable to go home for 60 days. I do not know if my house has

'I have been living at the Sarajevo Radio studios where I work as a

'I know that when I will walk out there, I will see destruction all around

Ultra-nationalists try to silence liberal voices

THE PRESS in Croatia and Serbia has remained relatively free over the past
year despite the imposition of censorship because of the civil war. But
recent events suggest that a widespread crackdown on the media is taking
place in both republics.
The Croatian authorities yesterday stepped up their campaign against critics
by prohibiting the publication of a leading opposition weekly magazine. In
Serbia, the state-run media is dismissing or demoting non-Serbs from the
radio and television.
The moves against the media in Croatia followed the decision by Mr Vladimir
Seks, the newly-appointed state prosecutor, to start proceedings against the
republic's most prominent journalists and members of the opposition.
They include Mr Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, head of the Croatian Peasants' party,
Mr Milorad Pupovac, leader of the Serbian Democratic Movement, and Ms Jelena
Lovric, a columnist at Danas, the weekly magazine.
The journalists and opposition members are being charged under article 197
of the penal code which states that anyone disseminating false information
will receive prison sentences of up to five years. Yesterday, the Croatian
authorities prohibited the publication of Danas, a forum for independent
thinking, on the grounds that it was insolvent.
But Mrs Savka Dabcevic-Kucar, leader of the opposition Croatian People's
Party, said it was an attempt by the ruling Croatian Democratic Union, led
by President Franjo Tudjman, to bring the small independent-minded press
under its control. Slobodna Dalmacija, a daily which has consistently
campaigned for press freedom, even under the former communist regime, will
also be placed under state control.
'Tudjman is becoming increasingly authoritarian. Anyone who criticises him
is regarded as a traitor to the Croatian state,' said Mr Mate Mestrovic,
deputy head of the People's Party.
He added that if the parliamentary elections go ahead as scheduled this
summer, censorship in the state-run television and media will be increased
even further. Unlike Serbia, there are no semi-official television or radio
channels.
Western diplomats and UN officials yesterday said Mr Tudjman is using the
international spotlight on Serbia as an opportunity to quash the opposition.
They also fear that through silencing his critics, Mr Tudjman may be
preparing to launch an offensive in eastern Slavonia, east of the republic
which Serb forces seized last year. Although parts of the region are now
under the protection of UN peace-keeping forces, diplomats believe Mr
Tudjman, and Mr Djoko Susak, the defence minister, are determined to place
the region under Zagreb's control.
In neighbouring Serbia, liberal-minded journalists have been demoted from
Tanjug, the Belgrade-based state-run news agency. 'Non-Serbs, or those with
mixed ethnic background are being dismissed,' said a former Tanjug editor.
'Those who speak out, or write the truth, are also being demoted or told to
leave,' he added.
Mr Vojislav Seselj, head of the ultra- nationalist Serbian Radical Party
recently published a list of Serb journalists whose critical reporting was
singled out for 'betraying the Serbian cause'. One freelance Serb
photographer had his house machine-gunned last week in Belgrade after
publishing photographs of a Serb executing a Moslem at point-blank range in
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Despite the clampdown in Serbia, the Belgrade-based Studio B, the
semi-independent television channel, and B 92, the radio station, and
Vremje, the weekly magazine, continue to break through the blanket of
censorship.
However, diplomats said it was only a matter of time before Serbia went the
same way as Croatia by silencing the liberal voices of opposition.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BLAZING row erupted yesterday within France's conservative opposition
alliance over differences in attitude towards the Maastricht treaty.
On Monday night, the Gaullist RPR party issued an ultimatum denouncing
participation of the centre-right UDF umbrella grouping led by former
President Valery Giscard d'Estaing in the referendum campaign to persuade
voters to approve the treaty.
The RPR leadership said continued UDF participation would have 'grave
consequences for the union of the opposition'.
The Gaullist party has now taken a decisive step towards outright opposition
to the Maastricht treaty, whereas the UDF and its centrist allies are openly
committed to support it.
Some political commentators fearthe split between the Gaullists and the UDF
could become so damaging as to jeopardise their chances of an effective
campaign in next spring's general elections.
Many of the leading figures in the UDF and centrist parties, starting with
Mr Giscard d'Estaing, are already campaigning for a 'Yes' vote in the
Maastricht referendum announced by President Francois Mitterrand for next
autumn.
Their eager agreement to take part in the referendum campaign, on the same
platform as ministers in the Socialist government, is one factor which has
helped to ignite the blazing row between the two conservative groups. But
the other factor is last week's Danish referendum, which narrowly rejected
the Maastricht agreement, and which has caused the Gaullist party to swing
decisively against the treaty.
Last month's debate in the National Assembly showed that the Gaullists were
deeply and passionately divided over Europe. Almost half the party's 126
members voted against the Maastricht treaty, while nearly all the remainder
abstained.
But since last week's Danish referendum, the anti-Community wing of the
Gaullist leadership, led by Senator Charles Pasqua, the former interior
minister, has succeeded in capturing control of the party's European policy,
and has swung it decisively against the treaty.
But UDF and centrist leaders yesterday firmly rejected the Gaullist threats,
and last night Mr Giscard d'Estaing planned to fulfil his commitment to
speak in support of Maastricht at a meeting in Selestat near Strasbourg, on
the same platform as Mrs Elizabeth Guigou, European affairs Minister in the
socialist government.
The Gaullists claim that UDF participation in the Maastricht campaign will
turn the referendum into a plebiscite of personal support for President
Mitterrand, with damaging effects on the election prospects of the
conservative parties next March.
There can be no doubt that Mr Mitterrand has from the beginning been aware
that the European debate was always going to be deeply damaging for the
conservative opposition.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Delors: exposed but likely to last - EC states, are unlikely
to risk making him a scapegoat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Jacques Delors, the mercurial president of the European Commission, is
arguably the man most exposed by the crisis brought upon the European
Community by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. Yet he is
probably at the same time unassailable.
At their Lisbon summit in two-weeks' time, the EC's 12 heads of government
will decide whether to reappoint him for 1993-95. Quite apart from his
considerable record, there are two imperative reasons why the member states
will probably stick with Mr Delors:
There is no obvious replacement who would get the nod now from the 12 as a
whole at a moment when they need to demonstrate that they are indeed a
whole.
Many community governments would risk undermining their European policy even
more were they to dramatise the treaty crisis by trying to make a scapegoat
of Mr Delors.
Inside Denmark, and across the EC, the two most common misgivings about
Maastricht seem to be:
That it goes too far towards supranational government,
And, in equal or greater measure, that it does not go far enough towards
European integration, particularly because it leaks away national
sovereignty without putting in place adequate mechanisms to hold to account
the 12's acting together, let alone the Commission.
Sacking Delors would risk putting the collective finger on both problems at
once.
There is also no evidence to suggest Mr Delors has lost the confidence of EC
leaders. For most of them, he serves simultaneously as lightning rod for
Euro-sceptics and as a bank of ideas and generator of momentum on Europe's
future (upon which, nevertheless, only the 12 can decide). Moreover, and
pace the prevalent sub-Napoleonic caricatures of him, Mr Delors is
increasingly a restraint on Euro-meddling in national affairs.
He finishes his second four-year term at the end of this year. What he will
probably be offered in Lisbon is an extension until 1995. Then, a new
commission would be appointed, probably for five years, to synchronise with
a newly elected European Parliament which would have the right to confirm
it.
All this assumes that Maastricht is adopted. The 12, including the Danish
government, last week decided to press on with the European Union treaty, in
the hope that Danish voters will have second thoughts. Continuing with Mr
Delors appears part of the strategy, even for the Danes who blame him in
part for their referendum result.
Remarks attributed to Delors aides, suggesting that the role of small
member-states would have to be down-graded once the EC takes in up to 20 new
members, are said to have cost two percentage points in the Danish
referendum. There is practically nothing in commission documents and minutes
on EC enlargement and institutional reform which could not have been
produced by a suitably programmed computer. It was an exercise in logic,
which acquired sinister connotations through a process of Chinese whispers,
underlining, as much as anything else, the community's presentational
problems.
The two most mooted candidates to succeed Mr Delors are unlikely to be
available for the interim 1993-95 term. They are Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch
prime minister, and Mr Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister of Spain. Both have
terms at home they are likely to want to complete, and neither, say
officials from both countries, would volunteer as a stop-gap.
Mr Lubbers is understood to be interested in a full term after 1995, and Mr
Gonzalez may well be too. It is the Spanish premier who appears to command
most Euro-consensus. He has the support of Chancellor Helmut Kohl of
Germany, who is no fan of the Dutch leader. But all this is almost certainly
for the future. The question now is Mr Delors.
The former French finance minister is one of those people who excites
immoderate praise or abuse. But what most sets him apart from his fellow
leaders is his consistent ability to think long-term, while remaining
immersed in the morass of EC detail. Before the EC can get properly started
on the future it needs a careful amalgam of vision and pragmatism, and Mr
Delors has been reasonably prodigal in both.
Workaholic and temperamental, with narrow, steely eyes as likely to reflect
amusement as anger from behind his spectacles, he is a social democrat who,
if he were not French, would be a Christian Democrat. He combines a
formidable intellect with the common-sense of the autodidact.
His achievements have come not so much through the relative power vested in
his office as through his own projection. He can claim to have relaunched
the EC by settling the budget wrangles of the early 1980s, and pushing
through the Single Market programme. Typically, this was but one of four
ideas (another was more co-operation on defence) he ran by EC leaders before
coming to Brussels in 1985.
Before the Maastricht summit, Mr Delors denounced impassionedly the
shortcomings of the treaty. Yet when 10 of the 12 threw out the Netherlands
presidency's attempt to bring new foreign and home affairs policies
partially into community decision-making, and Dutch Foreign Minister Hans
van den Broek was said by aides to be 'in shock,' it was Mr Delors who
persuaded him to concede immediately.
Mr Delors has read the community flow pretty well up to now. He, along with
his peers, may have taken too much for granted about the mood of Europe's
citizens. But, sinking or swimming together, it looks very much as though he
and they can still do business.

<TEXT>
GERMANY is likely to back a British plan to add an interpretation to the
Maastricht treaty on European union, seeking to define and limit the powers
of Brussels to intervene in questions better decided at national or regional
level.
The idea, mooted in London earlier this week, was greeted with some dismay
in Brussels where officials are nervous that any tampering with the treaty
could affect plans for speedy ratification.
The British suggestion was that certain aspects of the Maastricht treaty be
clarified - not renegotiated - to make it more palatable to Denmark and
other countries in the European Community. Danish voters rejected
ratification of the Maastricht treaty in a referendum last week.
A senior German official suggested that the heads of government meeting in
Lisbon at the end of this month should set up a task force involving the
Council of Ministers and the Commission, to look into subsidiarity - under
which decisions and action are taken by the central institutions of the
Community only if their objectives cannot be adequately achieved by the
individual member states or their regions - and report back to the Edinburgh
summit in December.
'The charm of the British idea (on the additional interpretation) is that
instead of waiting until the European Court of Justice defines it, the
governments themselves already start to define those areas where
subsidiarity applies.
'If we could, it would be helpful for us. It may even be helpful to the
Danish people,' the official said.
However, Mr Anders Rasmussen, Danish finance minister, yesterday suggested
the UK plan would have little effect on the outcome of the referendum.
'Of course we appreciate the British government's attempt to find solutions,
but we have to underline that we have to abide by the result of the
referendum. The Danish No must be respected and we can't change it by
declarations. A No is still a No.'
Officials in London made clear yesterday that Britain's proposal would be
only one of several ideas to be discussed by EC ministers in coming months.
They stressed that the government was not proposing a renegotiation of the
Maastricht treaty, but merely more detailed explanations of how it would
work in practice.
However, the officials denied that Britain had proposed a special protocol,
codicil or addendum to the treaty. The form of the desired clarification
would be a matter for discussion with the other EC members, as would the
idea itself.
In Paris the government rejected any suggestion of adding new text to the
treaty. Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, raised the British proposals
at lunch with Mr Roland Dumas, French foreign minister, during the first day
of the state visit to France by the Queen.
Mr Dumas said the French government remained committed to the position
agreed by the 12 last week.
The British government is under pressure from a growing body of Conservative
Euro-sceptics to modify the Maastricht treaty.
However, it claims that its latest proposal is motivated as much by the
desire to persuade the Danish people to change their mind and to meet
similar concerns from Germany and France.

SPANIARDS have supplanted the Swiss as the best paid managing directors in
Europe, with UK counterparts coming three-quarters of the way down a league
table of 12 countries, a survey reports.
Pay increases for executives, net of inflation, have declined across all the
main European economies. Rises of 2 per cent and under in the first quarter
of 1992 contrast with increases of over 5 per cent in the late 1980s.
The survey of more than 39,000 executives in over 3,300 companies was
carried out by a consortium of European management consultants. Countries
covered are Austria, Belgium, Denmark, France, Germany, Ireland,
Netherlands, Portugal, Spain, Switzerland and the UK, with some data from
Italy.
Gross annual pay for the managing director of a Spanish manufacturing
company with annual sales of Pounds 75m is Pounds 125,000. The comparable
Swiss figure is Pounds 123,000, UK Pounds 87,000 and, bottom of the league,
Ireland Pounds 65,000.

FT  10 JUN 92 / EC accord lays base for single securities market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FOUNDATIONS of a single European market in securities trading were laid
early this morning in Luxembourg by European Community finance ministers.
They reached preliminary agreement on rules to harmonise capital
requirements for European banks and securities firms.
The ministers and European Commission officials finally agreed the key
points of the draft capital adequacy directive shortly after midnight
following more than nine hours of talks.
The directive will lay out the regulatory framework for the single market,
putting securities firms and banks' trading operations on the same footing.
The agreement is likely to give fresh impetus to the investment services
directive. This second measure, which would build on the capital adequacy
directive, would give securities firms a passport to operate throughout the
EC. However, it has been held up by disputes between groups of member states
led by France and Britain.
Britain, which takes over the EC presidency next month, has always said it
favours an investment services directive, but only on terms which do not
damage City firms.
Until the final hour of talks it looked as though an accord would again be
held up as Britain, Germany and France tried to defend their interests.
Officials were cautious about proclaiming a breakthrough, pointing out that
a number of technical issues needed to be resolved before formal agreement
could be reached. The whole measure will return to the finance ministers'
agenda on June 29 for political approval.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC commissioner for financial services, welcomed the
deal and said afterwards: 'I have throughout made it clear that the purpose
of the directive is to lead to the opening of the European securities
market. This is now being done in a fair way which is guaranteed not to
damage the legitimate interests of any existing market.'
The agreement will apply to securities firms and to the part of banks'
balance sheets on which investment business is conducted - the so-called
'trading book'. If formally approved, the directive would theoretically take
effect from the beginning of next year, although implementation is likely to
take much longer. The main points of the deal include:
A flexible limit on the amount of capital which firms must have to back
single investments or 'large exposures'. Firms will be allowed a window of
10 days in which to breach existing limits restricting such investments to
25 per ent of their capital base. This should help preserve the
manoeuvrability of Britain's small merchant banks.
A choice of the limit on the amount of subordinated short-term debt firms
can count as capital for regulatory purposes. An agreement that will allow
corporate treasurers and pension funds, as well as banks and investment
firms, to carry out so-called repurchase agreements under the looser rules
of the capital adequacy directive.
A three-year review period to ensure that the directive continues to fit in
with international accords on capital adequacy, such as that proposed
between securities and banking regulators earlier this year.
Commission officials described the deal as 'a fairly uncomfortable
compromise' for everyone.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Oftel tells BT to lower prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER PHONE bills are in prospect after BT, the telecommunications group,
was told yesterday to accept a tough new pricing regime or face
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, proposed that BT should be forced
to cut the average level of its prices by 7.5 percentage points below the
rate of inflation, compared with 6.25 points at present.
Given the current level of inflation at 4.3 per cent, this would mean many
customers would receive cuts in their phone bills.
To help small customers, connection charges would be cut to Pounds 99 from
the present Pounds 152.75 and a more generous scheme would be introduced for
those who seldom use the phone.
Moreover, BT, which wanted to increase line rental charges by 8 points more
than inflation annually, would only be allowed to increase them by 2 points.
In making its proposals, Oftel wants to ensure residential customers share
the benefits of price cuts and to help BT's rivals compete against it.
The package is harsher on BT than expected and the last from Sir Bryan
Carsberg before he steps down as Oftel director-general at the end of this
week.
The proposals have been influenced by criticism that BT's profits - Pounds
3.07bn in the last financial year - are excessive and that domestic
customers have received a poor deal since the company was privatised in
1984.
Business would still be the main beneficiary, with bills falling by about 10
percentage points below inflation each year.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Majority of EC ministers oppose budget increase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LUXEMBOURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of European Community finance ministers yesterday came out
against an increase in the EC budget, widening the rift between rich and
poor member states.
Differences over the budget could dominate the Lisbon summit at the end of
this month, increasing the pressure on the Community following last week's
rejection of the Maastricht treaty by the Danish people.
Seven countries, led by the UK and Germany, said yesterday they wanted to
limit their budget contributions.
Only Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland - which stand to benefit the most
from an enlarged budget - backed the so-called Delors II package. Denmark
did not take part in the discussion. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission
president, and his fellow commissioners are calling for an increase in the
EC budget from Ecu66.6bn (Pounds 46.7bn) this year to Ecu87.5bn in 1997, at
current prices.
The budget row could have damaging effects in Ireland, which holds its
referendum on Maastricht next week. Pro-Maastricht campaigners in the
republic have made much of the financial benefits of closer union.
Ministers yesterday reaffirmed their commitment to continued economic
integration despite last week's Danish vote. But member states vary widely
in their enthusiasm for the budget proposals.
Richer member states want to limit their EC budget contribution to 1.2 per
cent of gross national product while they strain to meet criteria for
economic convergence imposed by the Maastricht treaty. They point out that
EC spending does not match contributions even at current levels, but the
Delors package proposes a gradual increase to 1.37 per cent of GNP by 1997.
Mr Horst Kohler, Germany's deputy finance minister, said yesterday such an
increase was unacceptable. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor of the
exchequer, said the Delors proposals were not dead, but that there had been
some very blunt talking.
The finance ministers' conclusions will be submitted to foreign ministers
for their meeting, also in Luxembourg, on Monday. Mr Kohler said before the
debate that the budget should not be merely a list of the Commission's
wishes for which cash had to be found.
He said a failure to explain EC policymaking to the public might have been
one reason for last week's Danish vote.
Ministers also heard the tough judgments by the monetary committee of EC
national treasury officials and the EC financial watchdog, the Court of
Auditors.
Mr Cees Maas, who heads the committee, told ministers 'cohesion' funds for
poorer EC members should not be released until those nations had achieved
strict economic convergence targets.
EC finance ministers last night added harmonisation of indirect taxes to the
list of topics that EC leaders will be asked to discuss during the Lisbon
summit.
They will come back to the measures at a special extra council of ministers
on June 29, after EC leaders have glanced at them during the summit on June
26 and June 27.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Imro admits failings over Maxwell: Regulator's own report
sharply critical over absence of risk assessment procedures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE plundering of the Maxwell pension funds
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
from which more than Pounds 400m was siphoned off before the death of Mr
Robert Maxwell - has prompted a sharply self-critical report by the
investment management industry's own watchdog.
According to the confidential report, which is expected to be delivered to
the government, Imro, the self-regulatory body for the fund management
industry, is believed to admit that it failed to set up any proper risk
assessment procedures to identify 'problem cases'.
The Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog, earlier
this year asked Imro, whose members manage Pounds 300bn in pension funds, to
review its oversight of Bishopsgate Investment Management.
BIM was the Maxwell-owned fund manager which was apparently the instrument
of the pension funds theft. Imro allowed it to operate under the more lax
regulatory status given to in-house pension scheme fund managers.
News that Imro has been critical of its own performance as a supervisor came
as it emerged that two prominent City firms should have suspected for over a
year before Mr Maxwell's death that they had been used in the disappearance
of securities under their control, according to a writ filed in the High
Court.
Imro was set up in 1987 along with other City bodies to regulate
relationships between clients and finance business. It was heavily attacked
by a committee of MPs for its 'comic' and 'inadequate' performance in the
Maxwell pension fund scandal.
Imro's report is likely to encourage the 32,000 Maxwell company pensioners
to press for government compensation.
The internal assessment by a member of the Imro staff is understood to have
concluded that the initial decision to admit the Maxwell fund to Imro
supervision in 1988 was reasonable in the light of the knowledge available
at the time and because 1,200 schemes had had to be assessed in a short
time.
The report is, however, critical of the fact that the first visit to check
the working of the Maxwell scheme did not happen until late 1990 and that it
seemed to have been a routine affair.
The report's main criticism - already leading to changes in the way Imro
views its work - is that there was no system for identifying pension funds
in need of closer supervision.
It is likely that Imro will try to develop a more investigative edge,
perhaps by increasing resources and strengthening the staff.
The initial plan was that the document would go to the government and
eventually be published as a parliamentary paper. It may now be submitted as
evidence to the independent inquiry on pensions announced by Mr Peter
Lilley, social security secretary.
Mr Lilley insisted that the Pounds 2.5m in temporary, emergency funding to
help pensioners of Mirror Group Newspapers, announced by the government on
Monday, would be adequate.
No government, he said, could agree to underwrite the pensions of current
and deferred pensioners.
Speaking in a Commons debate last night, he responded sympathetically to the
suggestion that pension contributors should be made holders of their
contributions.

FT  10 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: New image set to revive dejected
Turkish stocks - Market reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not unusual these days for authorities at the Istanbul stock market to
mount a surprise audit of one of the exchange's 110 brokers. It happened
recently and Mr Imre Yigit of Global Securities, one of the brokerages
affected, believes that the government is intent on setting an example as
part of its new good housekeeping image.
A new image is certainly needed. In the first four months of 1992, no
emerging market slumped as much as Turkey's, according to the International
Finance Corporation, the World Bank's private-sector lending arm. The index
yesterday was down on the day, but 40 per cent below its all time high of
5,749 on August 2 1990, the day Iraq invaded Kuwait. Trading volume at
around TL200bn is less than a third of the recent high point in January.
Foreigners have all but departed the exchange floor, while local short-term
investors are attracted to put their savings into gold or bank deposits.
However, the government is now making a concerted effort to revive the
market's fortunes. Amendments have been passed to the Capital Markets law,
which seek to provide greater investor protection against insider trading
and other offences. There are tax changes in place to reduce the attraction
of holding treasury bills, and so stimulate equity trading.
The reforms, which review the tax breaks enjoyed by holders of government
paper, have already been approved by parliament and await the president's
signature. A tender is also about to be issued to install a computer system
in the markets's new Istinye premises, a convention hall once owned by the
tourism ministry.
Mr Yigit, head of research at Global, believes that the country is pulling
out of recession and he expects share prices to follow. 'The market's cheap,
which ever way you look at it,' he says.
Inflation figures for May, published last Friday, have given added
encouragement to that view and analysts now believe that the annual rate
will settle at less than 60 per cent, down on the 70 per cent rate recorded
last year.
Industrial production in the first quarter was up 10.2 per cent and Global
is projecting real profits growth for the market of between 10 and 15 per
cent this year.
However, most brokers are agreed that if the stock exchange is to take
advantage of any pick-up in the economy, it will have to push ahead with its
proposed reforms.
Poor accounting is only one of the problems, ranging from insider trading
and certificate forgery, to technical questions relating to settlement and
clearance. Under the new law, it was suggested that shares held by company
directors should carry special serial numbers in an effort to deter insider
trading. Later, this proved impracticable to implement.
Settlement, too, is a problem, particularly for foreign investors. Largely
because of the lira's depreciation, the current system requires that brokers
clear their trading account either by cash or physical stock delivery within
one day. Brokerage houses frequently have to use their own resources to meet
the settlement deadline on the behalf of their foreign clients.
Forged share certificates, stolen certificates, even the use of shares
impounded under court orders: these also remain major problems, despite the
vigilance of publishing the serial numbers in the official daily list.
A US consultancy has now been contracted to devise new settlement procedures
 -the first step of which is to encourage brokers to pool more of their
share certificates in a central depository. This would speed up clearance
and reduce the incidence of forgery.
If all goes well, the aim, once the market moves to its new premises and
adopts fully computerised trading, is to have a paperless exchange.

bourses

<TEXT>
BOURSES which returned from the Whit Monday holiday were mainly lower
yesterday, writes Our Markets Staff. In southern Europe, open on Monday,
Madrid reacted to the higher interest rates which had depressed Milan a day
earlier.
PARIS was upset by a weak bond market as well as lingering concerns over
Maastricht. The financial sector featured Societe Generale, down FFr12.00 to
FFr524.00 and Suez, FFr2.50 lower at FFr318.40. The CAC-40 closed down 19.35
at 1,962.23.
However, there was plenty of corporate news to keep traders interested. An
analysts' meeting with Schneider had a profound effect on its stock and that
of its subsidiaries. The group gave negative comments on prospects and its
shares tumbled FFr54.00 or some 7 per cent to FFr708.00. This followed
through into Merlin, down FFr49.00 to FFr546.00 and Spie, off FFr26.00 at
FFr329.00. Meanwhile, SPEP shed FFr33.00 to Fr330.00.
Pechiney's investment certificates were suspended at FFr360.00 pending an
announcement, after the close, that it was to sell its nuclear assets for
some FFr2bn. Pechiney International was FFr2.30 weaker at FFr201.10.
Elsewhere dealing in Casino was suspended prior to the announcement that the
private group, Rallye, is selling its food business to Casino, thereby
creating the country's second largest food retailer. Disappointing figures
from Club Mediterranee and rumours of a rights issue sent the Club's shares
down Fr20.00, or 3.8 per cent to FFr495.00.
FRANKFURT saw its main price changes in secondary stocks, the DAX index
falling by only 2.81 to 1,786.26 after a 0.67 decline to 713.60 in the FAZ
at midsession. Volume fell from DM5.6bn to only DM3.8m.
Among the second liners Continental, the tyremaker, traded in DM33m as the
shares rose DM4 to DM276 with some dealers blaming Pirelli SpA, the Italian
company which began its pursuit of Conti nearly two years ago. Pirelli,
however, is not believed to have the resources to put its merger plans into
practice.
Definite merger terms were behind the rise in Hoesch, the steel company,
which leapt another DM8.20 yesterday to a new 1992 high of DM290. But the
terms, involving Krupp AG shares and a minimal amount of cash, are of
limited value since the Krupp AG shares are not yet quoted.
Mr Michael Geiger of County NatWest said yesterday that speculators may be
trading on an independent auditors' report which has said that Hoesch alone
would be worth DM5.3bn, or DM745 a share. However, this is based on
arbitrary criteria, says Mr Geiger, who adds the the steel industry
environment is still difficult and that the speculators could be on the
wrong track.
AMSTERDAM's CBS Tendency Index finished 0.2 lower at 130.4 in turnover of
some Fl 439m.
Fokker advanced 20 cents to Fl 34.20 following news that agreement had been
reached with DASA whereby the Dutch manufacturer will be the lead company in
production of short-haul regional aircraft.
Philips was 50 cents stronger at Fl 38.60 in spite of announcing that it had
placed 1.5m new shares while Heineken lost 50 cents to Fl 167.00 on news
that rationalisation costs at its Spanish brewer El Aguila could reach Fl
100m. Grolsch was also lower, Fl 2.50 at Fl 213.50, following an analysts
meeting.
MILAN saw a late wave of support-buying and short-covering focused on
Olivetti and Fiat, and a 1.04 fall to 480.04 in the Comit index at the close
was replaced by a marginal gain in continuous trading.
Olivetti rose L38 to L3,018 and Fiat, after a L66 fall to L5,164 on the
official day, recovered to L5,200 on the kerb. A selective, and limited
recovery in bank shares saw Credito Italiano up L20 at L1,670 and Mediobanca
L120 higher at L13,220.
MADRID's general index closed down 2.93 at 250.7 in high turnover of some
Pta13bn. Stocks with US exposure were affected by the weakness of the dollar
while some general profit-taking was noted. Telefonica slipped Pta25 to
Pta1,095.
STOCKHOLM extended its losing streak to five consecutive sessions, the
Affarsvarlden General index closing 11.0 lower at 963.5.
SE Banken C shares led the decline at SKr31, down from SKr35 last Friday,
when it revealed a SKr600m first quarter operating loss, and down 24 per
cent from SKr41 ten days ago. Ahead of its interim next Tuesday, Svenska
Handelsbanken B fell SKr4 to SKr55.
COPENHAGEN's all-share index fell 1.89 to 329.58 in very thin trade, writes
Hilary Barnes, with turnover at only DKr131m.

FT  10 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Pension fund and
investment trusts lift Tokyo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL-lot buying by pension funds and investment trusts pushed up share
prices yesterday, but continuing inactivity among institutional investors
left volume subdued, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average closed up 189.98 at 17,845.04, having fallen in the
morning to the day's low of 17,550.28 on arbitrage unwinding. It reached a
high of 17,861.50 in the afternoon on small-lot bargain hunting and dealer
buying of theme stocks.
Volume was unchanged at 170m shares. Advances led declines by 646 to 258
with 174 unchanged, the Topix index of all first section stocks advanced
9.20 to 1,346.99 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index added 0.84 to
1,063.24.
Investors waited for this week's June futures and options expiration,
although most traders reckon that their concerns over arbitrage unwinding
have subsided, due to the decline in cash stock positions held against the
June futures.
However, some caution remains because rule changes concerning option
exercise and settlements will be implemented from the June contract.
'Since option exercise has been limited to once a month on expiration day
instead of once a week, share prices will be affected by Friday's exercise
related trading,' said Mr Masa Sato, derivatives trader at Dai-ichi
Securities. Large buying positions of 'put' options - or the right to sell -
at the 18,500 level could depress the index, he added.
Dealers used theme stocks to boost volume. Meiji Milk Products, the most
active issue of the day, rose Y67 to Y992, capturing 12 per cent of market
volume. Other bio-technology related issues were also firm, with Morinaga
Milk Industry rising Y29 to Y866 and Okamoto Industries advancing Y30 to
Y1,340.
Fuji Photo Film gained attention on reports that it had developed an
anti-cancer substance with Harvard University. However, initial interest
waned, and Fuji closed unchanged at Y2,830.
High-technology issues were higher on bargain hunting. Hitachi rose Y4 to
Y799 and Toshiba added Y4 to Y635. However, Nikon, the precision products
group, fell Y19 to Y605, extending its losses for the fifth consecutive day.
Investors were discouraged by the company's forecast of a 44 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits for the year to March 1993.
In Osaka, the OSE average rose 245.29 to 20,497.55 in volume of 10m shares.
The index was supported by small-lot, dealer buying of environmental and
bio-technology related shares.
Roundup
THE SEARCH for 'hot' markets in the region came to a halt yesterday, most of
them falling, and Hong Kong playing a painful arbitrage game in the banking
sector. Jakarta was closed for the Indonesian general election.
BANGKOK threatened its May 19 low of 667.84 for 1992, the SET index dropping
18.79 or 2.7 per cent to 684.47 in turnover of Bt4.7bn. Selling was inspired
by nervousness about today's third and final reading of a constitutional
amendment, and demonstrations planned by pro-military and opposition groups.
Two property groups, Krisda Mahanakorn and Bangkok Land, fell by Bt12 and
Bt7, to Bt186 and Bt126 respectively, coming second and third on the
most-active list.
HONG KONG was pulled down by the continued fall in HSBC Holdings, parent of
the Hongkong Bank, in the wake of its successful bid for Midland Bank of the
UK.
HSBC fell HK2 to HK44.75 for a two-day drop of HKDollars 3.50, and banks in
general posted the biggest losses as the Hang Seng index fell 38.56 to
5,940.19 following Monday's 57-point decline. Turnover rose from HKDollars
3.83bn to HKDollars 4.07bn.
In an international context, brokers said that traders had reversed the
arbitrage process followed when the Hong Kong market was going up, and were
now selling HSBC to buy Midland.
SEOUL hit its lowest point since President Roh Tae-woo came to power in
February 1988, although intervention by the market stabilisation fund left
the composite index just 1.89 down at 561.76 after an intraday low of
551.38.
Most professionals, however, said that private and institutional investors
were demoralised.
TAIWAN's weighted index dropped 38.39 to 4,526.65 on fears that the central
bank would tighten money market liquidity to fight inflation.
MANILA dipped slightly on profit-taking, the composite index closing 12.03
lower at 1,568.25, but having seen a break about the 1,600 barrier in the
morning, dealers thought that there was still upside in the market.
BOMBAY closed up but off the day's highs on profit-taking and the BSE index
gained 53.57 to 3,154.23 for a rise of 2 per cent since Monday.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: EMS comments raise D-Mark
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK appreciated sharply against European currencies yesterday morning
after the President of the German Bundesbank said that a realignment of the
European Monetary System was not impossible, writes James Blitz.
Although the D-Mark rally petered out later in the day, the German currency
still closed in London maintaining the gains it has made against sterling
and the Italian lira in recent days. The French franc and the Spanish peseta
ended the day slightly stronger overall, but only after senior financial
officials had made comments in their support. The London market remained
convinced that the troubles over European Monetary Union (Emu) triggered by
Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty last week have not played
themselves out.
Comments from Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank President, casting doubt
on the 1999 deadline for Emu as too optimistic, forced the D-Mark sharply
upwards against sterling in the first hours of London trading. The pound hit
a low of DM2.9077, but was propped up by better-than-expected May producer
prices figures showing a rise of 0.1 per cent. Sterling ended the day
unchanged on its previous close at DM2.9150
The Italian lira looked more anaemic, finishing at Lira757.40 to the D-Mark,
compared to a previous close of Lira756.80. The currency also ended at the
bottom of the EMS grid, just below sterling.
The French franc recovered against the D-Mark after the French Finance
Minister made a strong appeal for a franc fort. The D-Mark closed at
FFr3.367, slightly down on a previous close of FFr 3.370. The Spanish peseta
also held its ground, helped by a statement from the EC Finance Ministers
supporting Spain's current effort to meet the Maastricht concvergence
criteria. It closed the day at Pta62.98 against a previous close of
Pta63.12.
The dollar finished the day barely changed on its previous close against the
D-Mark, after the markets had tested the US currency's downside at Dollars
1.5890. It finished in Europe at DM1.5900 compared to a previous close of
DM1.5895.
The dollar's fortunes will now be determined by US inflation and retail
sales figures for May due out on Thursday. If the retail sales figure
emerges lower than the expected 0.5 per cent rise, the market may test the
dollar's downside again, expecting that the Federal Reserve might reduce
interest rates.
But some are bullish about the US currency's longer term prospects. 'Once
the post Maastricht blues are out of the way, the D-Mark will weaken,' said
one analyst.' Anticipation that the Bundesbank will ease rates will also
undermine the D-Mark.'

FT  10 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Futures up after dip
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT dated sterling money market futures dipped sharply lower yesterday
morning as traders reacted nervously to the pound's losses on the foreign
exchange markets.
The September short sterling contract dipped down to 90.12, its lowest level
since the  1/2 percentage point base rate cut in May, as sterling reached a
low point of DM2.9077 in the morning. The contract later recovered in tandem
with the currency to close at 90.23. This closing price implies that the
three month sterling interbank rate in September will be 9.77 per cent.
Similar gyrations were seen in the June short sterling contract, which hit a
low point of 89.93 in the morning and closed at 90.00. This implies that the
3-month rate will be at 10 per cent by the end of next week.
Traders were at odds over how to explain the movement in futures. One said
that that the short contracts were tracking the movements of sterling
throughout the day. But others said that the bullish view about rates in the
afternoon followed a newspaper report that the Treasury had cut its growth
forecast for 1992. Although the Treasury said it had not revised its
forecast, any such fall in its growth estimates might suggest the need for a
new base rate cut.
There was far less activity in the sterling cash market, after the Bank of
England forecast a small shortage in the morning of Pounds 250m. As
sometimes happens with the smaller shortages, this one proved difficult to
remove. The Bank did not operate in the market during the day and provided
late assistance at 2.45 pm of around Pounds 140m.
The difficulties removing the shortage meant that short term rates in the
cash market firmed slightly in the morning. But they ended the day unchanged
on Monday's close. 1-month money ended at 9 7/8 -9 13/16 per cent, while
everything from 2 months to 9 months closed at 10-9 7/8 per cent. Traders
reported that there was a slightly more bearish tone to the market, with
more sellers than buyers. The overnight rate was reported to have hit a low
of 8 1/2 per cent in the morning, and closed at 9 3/4 per cent.
German call money was steady at 9.60-65 per cent yesterday, unchanged at the
levels seen on Friday, before Monday's one-day holiday.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian magnesium hopes
boosted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S HOPES of developing a magnesium metal industry have been boosted
by agreement on a ADollars 50m research project with Australian and Japanese
companies.
Senator John Button, industry minister, said the federal government and the
Queensland state government would contribute ADollars 25m (Pounds 10.4m) to
the project over the next four years.
The remainder of the financing will be provided by MIM Holdings, the
Australian resources group, Ube Industries of Japan, and Queensland Metals
Corporation.
The government hopes the project will develop low cost technology for the
production of magnesium metal from a magnesite deposit at Kunwarara, in
Queensland, which is controlled by QMC.
Kunwarara, which was discovered by QMC in 1985, is believed to be the
largest cryptocrystalline magnesite deposit in the world. It is situated
close to ports and power supplies, in an area of little environmental
significance.
Senator Button said the project would culminate in the development of a
magnesium metal demonstration plant at the port of Gladstone, 160 km (100
miles) south of Kunwarara. A full-scale production plant could follow if the
technology is deemed to be viable.
Successful development of low-cost technology would create an opportunity
for Australia to play a major role in the world magnesium metal industry.
Magnesium metal could eventually parallel the aluminium industry as a major
export earner, Senator Button said.
The government believes world demand for magnesium metal will increase
significantly over the next 10 years. Much of the demand is expected to come
from the vehicle industry as car manufacturers produce lighter vehicles to
meet tighter environmental standards.
Mr Wayne Goss, the Queensland premier, said the demonstration plant could be
upgraded to produce 60,000 tonnes of magnesium a year if the research
project was successful.
Mr Norm Fussell, Managing Director of MIM, said the research agreement was
'a positive step full of promise for a new wealth creating industry in
Australia by the turn of the century'.

16.8%

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA'S TEA output dropped by more than 11m kg in the first quarter of this
year compared with the corresponding period of 1991, according to African
Tea Brokers, an influential brokerage, reports Reuter from Cianda, Kenya.
ATB said that the cumulative crop figure at the end of April stood at 56.58m
kg, a decline of 11.43m kg, or 16.8 per cent, compared with the first
quarter of 1991. Tea harvested in April dropped by more than 5m kg, or 29
per cent against the same month last year.
ATB said widespread seasonal rain had been reported from all tea growing
districts and the crop had responded well. 'But in some areas growth had
been inhibited by low temperatures'.
'Showers have ceased and leaf intake has shown some decline but is still
fairly heavy. With milder weather leaf intake will show a marked progressive
improvement,' ATB said.
Tea is Kenya's second biggest foreign exchange earner after coffee, bringing
the economy Dollars 265m in 1991.
ATB said 128,722 packages were sold at an average price of Dollars 1.65 in
four sales in April, compared with 164,434 at Dollars 1.45 in April 1991.
The packages are between 40-60 kg depending on quality.
Brokers said in the first two sales there was strong demand, and prices were
buoyant, particularly for brighter teas. In the latter auctions prices
declined. Britain and Pakistan were the main buyers.
Mr George Saitoti, the finance minister told parliament last week that
growth in tea production last year was 2.5 per cent, the lowest in the past
five years. Tea production rose to a record 202m kg in 1991 from 197m kg in
1990.

The London COCOA market resumed its bearish trend yesterday afternoon,
ending the day just above the lows although in routine volume. At the London
Futures and Options Exchange the September cocoa price closed at Pounds 549
a tonne, down Pounds 11 on the day. Traders identified arbitrage selling and
the uncovering of sell-stops in the US as the main reasons for the decline.
'We may have been affected by stops (stop-loss selling orders) going in New
York, but London was looking weak even before that,' one trader said.
Turnover in COFFEE futures picked up slightly in the afternoon and prices
edged higher by up to as Dollars 4. But traders were not expecting any
significant price recovery until nearer the first set of International
Coffee Agreement negotiations on June 22-26. At the London Metal Exchange
ALUMINIUM prices came under further pressure in spite of a fall in LME
warehouse stocks. Dealers attributed the cash position's Dollars 20 fall to
a 2 1/2 -month low of Dollars 1,269.50 a tonne to investment fund
liquidation. The price has now lost Dollars 40 in an uninterrupted 4-day
slide. Dull fundamentals continued to weigh down the NICKEL market, in spite
of Chinese buying.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Charting gold's midsummer
misery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOLD market has become seasonal in recent years, peaking in mid-winter
and falling to a trough in mid-summer, according to Mr Andy Smith, analyst
with Union Bank of Switzerland.
Several factors combine to bring about this trend, Mr Smith suggests in the
UBS Precious Metals Outlook. In the West, jewellery sales are concentrated
in the run-up to Christmas. 'Production lead times and capacity restraints
mean jewellery manufacturers must obtain raw material three to six months
ahead of this consumption cycle.'
During the Muslim Ramadan, which will continue to be celebrated in spring on
the western calendar until the end of the decade, the average gold price is
usually lower and is traded in a narrower range. 'Reduced price volatility
during Ramadan is consistent with less than full participation in the market
by important Middle East players.'
Mr Smith also points out that Chinese New Year - another occasion for gifts
of jewellery - falls in February. In nine of the last 12 years the gold
price has been lower in February than in January.
In addition the Indian wedding season runs from September to May, and takes
a complete break during the June-August monsoon. More than half India's
annual demand for gold of 250 tonnes is wedding-related.
Seasonal movements in both oil and the dollar also reinforce the seasonal
gold price swings, Mr Smith believes. In summer the oil price tends to be
weak while the dollar, which helps to determine how much 95 per cent of the
population outside the US pay for gold, is usually strong.
Shocks to the gold market still count, Mr Smith says, but 'positive
surprises in the first half of the year simply have to work harder to have a
sustained impact on price.'
A Tokyo district court has rejected an appeal by a British coin dealer
against police refusal to return his 3,200 gold coins seized as fakes, the
Kyodo News Service said, reports Reuter from Tokyo.
Kyodo quoted the court as saying, in rejecting the appeal from Mr Paul
Davies: 'It is clear that the confiscated coins are all counterfeit. It is
necessary to continue to impound the coins since an international
investigation into the counterfeiting is still under way'.
The coins, which Mr Davies sent to three Japanese dealers, were purportedly
among 11m commemorative pieces struck by the Osaka Mint for the 60th
anniversary in 1985 of Emperor Hirohito's enthronement.
Police said they seized a total of 108,000 fake coins from Tokyo banks, Mr
Davies and other dealers.
The face value of the genuine coins is twice that of the 20 grams of gold
they contain. More than 9m were sold in Japan.
Davies filed his appeal in April after an unsuccessful two-year struggle to
recover his coins, seized by police in February 1990 from a bonded warehouse
at Narita airport.
The coins claimed by Davies have a total face value of Y320m yen (Dollars
2.52m). Mr Davies also sued the Japanese government and Tokyo city
authorities on May 19, seeking that sum in compensation, plus interest at 5
per cent since they were impounded.

FT  10 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Canadian dealers propose
reforms to 'bought deals'
</HEADLINE>

CANADIAN securities dealers have proposed reforms to the system of 'bought
deals' aimed at lessening their own risk in this type of underwriting and
providing a greater incentive to canvass small investors.
Bought deal financing has revolutionised the Canadian capital market in the
past five years by giving local companies even faster access to capital than
US issuers. The bought deal involves finalising an underwriting agreement
either simultaneously with, or often in advance of, publication of a
prospectus. Its other hallmark is the absence of a 'market-out' clause in
the underwriting agreement, thereby barring underwriters from withdrawing
once the price is set.
Although bought deals now make up almost two thirds of all common equity
offerings in Canada, they have drawn considerable criticism. Stockbrokers
tend to concentrate their selling efforts on large institutional clients so
that they can eliminate their underwriting risk as quickly as possible.
Several high-profile bought deals in recent years have not been able to
satisfy retail demand. According to the Investment Dealers Association,
'this perception of inequitable treatment among investors is not positive
for Canada's capital markets to the extent it may lead to reduced retail
participation in equity underwritings and secondary market transactions'.
After a heated debate within its own ranks, the IDA has proposed two
reforms. First, underwriters would be barred from soliciting advance
commitments from institutions, known as 'pre-marketing'. This ban would
apply to issues by the 180 or so companies which are allowed to offer shares
on the basis of abridged prospectuses.
The proposal aims at preventing the dissemination of information not
available to the market as a whole. The restriction would not apply to
private placements.
Second, a gap of at least six hours (in practice, overnight) would be
required between filing a preliminary prospectus and completion of an
underwriting agreement. The IDA hopes this delay will encourage securities
firms to solicit interest from smaller investors before committing
themselves to a price.
The IDA's proposals must still be considered by provincial securities
commissions. The regulators are likely to call for comments from other
interested groups before any new rules are put in place.

FT  10 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Australian white goods maker
up sharply

<TEXT>
EMAIL, the leading Australian white goods maker, yesterday reported sharply
higher earnings and announced plans for an effective increase in the
dividend.
Despite static sales of ADollars 1.38bn (USDollars 1.06bn), net profit rose
by almost 30 per cent to ADollars 55.3m for the year ended March 1992.
The dividend is being held at 17 cents a share, but on capital increased by
a rights issue.
The increase in earnings was more than accounted for by a reduction in
Email's net interest bill from ADollars 28.6m to ADollars 13.6m. Also, the
figures excluded extraordinary losses of ADollars 946,000, against ADollars
5.1m previously.
Directors said they had reacted early to the recession by divesting
uneconomic operations and restructuring productive capacity.
'This resulted in increased productivity in the manufacturing areas,' they
said.
'Some of the benefits of these actions were recorded in the current year,
but longer-term gains will flow as increased demand lifts production
volumes.
'Directors believe any improvement in the economy and growth in employment
will remain slow.'
Lion Nathan, New Zealand's biggest brewing group, has sold a chain of New
Zealand department stores to a management group and a Maori development
consortium for NZDollars 32m (USDollars 17.3m), writes Terry Hall from
Wellington.
The 85 stores employ 2,000 staff.
Lion Nathan said the sale marked the final stage of its strategy to focus on
core beverage businesses in New Zealand and in Australia, where it is
completing the purchase of Bond Brewing.

FT  10 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Loan of BFr3bn for Gechem
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GECHEM, the Belgian polyurethane foam manufacturer, is to receive a BFr3bn
(Dollars 92m) subordinated loan from Societe Generale de Belgique, the
conglomerate owning 58.5 per cent of the company. The loan will be
reimbursed by an increase in capital before June 30 next year, writes Paul
Abrahams.
Gechem is also to be renamed Recticel, following an extraordinary general
meeting yesterday. The renaming reflects the group's desire to concentrate
on the activities of its subsidiary Recticel which makes polyurethane foam.
The company has been troubled by debt and made a BFr1.9bn loss last year,
following an ill-fated expansion in the US. Last year, it abandoned majority
control of Foamex LP, its US subsidiary. Foamex's sales were below
expectations and Gechem was unable to service the debt taken on to buy its
stake. Gechem made losses of about BFr500m on its US foray.

heavy selling pressure

<TEXT>
THE SHARE price of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank came under heavy selling
pressure yesterday as arbitrageurs quit their holdings, analysts said.
At the same time, the shareholders of the bank approved resolutions at an
extraordinary general meeting which gave management the authority to make
its share and cash bid for Midland Bank.
The meeting - which lasted 15 minutes and at which no questions were asked -
also revoked the board's right to restrict individual shareholders to owning
no more than 1 per cent of the bank.
The price of HSBC Holdings fell to a low of HKDollars 44 yesterday before
recovering slightly to close at HKDollars 44.75 - HKDollars 2 below Monday's
level.
On the Hong Kong closing price, the Hongkong Bank's offer for Midland valued
each share at 440p, down from the 471p valuation a week ago when 60p cash
was injected into the bid to make it more attractive to UK institutional
shareholders.
Analysts said the weakness in Hongkong Bank and Midland's share price
reflected traders selling the stocks because a higher bid from Lloyds for
Midland did not materialise. Holders of HSBC were betting on it withdrawing
in the face of a higher Lloyds offer for Midland.
Those who may want to buy HSBC, because they manage funds linked to the
FT-SE Share Index or the FT All Share index, were unable to until the merger
was consummated, analysts said.
'Investors who will be compelled to buy HSBC can't do so for two weeks and
for an arbitrageur that's too long,' said Ms Laura Grenning, banking analyst
at Smith New Court.
Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank's chairman, speaking after the
extraordinary general meeting, said it was difficult to say why the bank's
share price fell, though he thought the weakness would be short-term.
'Maybe there is some arbitrage going on, a little profit-taking. Some say
disappointed people in London are selling,' he said.

FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: IBM dons a different suit of
clothes - Attempts to break into the low end of the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL Business Machines (IBM) is donning unfamiliar clothes as it
moves to attack markets that have hitherto been beneath its lofty gaze.
Last week, the world's largest computer manufacturer unveiled a new,
wholly-owned subsidiary to battle head-to-head in Europe with low-cost
'clone' personal computer-makers.
But camouflage dress seemed to be the order of the day for the new company.
Mr Bill McCracken, general manager of IBM Europe's Personal Systems Business
Unit, stood in regulation navy blue suit beside Mr Alan Willsher, the head
of the new European subsidiary, Individual Computer Products International
(ICPI).
'Notice the difference between IBM and ICPI,' he said, drawing attention to
Mr Willsher's plaid jacket, blue shirt and yellow tie. He was underlining
the independence of IBM's new venture from its big and bureaucratic US
parent.
ICPI was launched in the UK recently with the aim of taking IBM firmly into
the low end of the PC marketplace.
It is an area where the industry's largest manufacturer is both weak and
under sharp attack from 'clone' makers which assemble PCs from standard
components that are functionally similar to IBM's machines but significantly
cheaper.
These manufacturers benefit from lower overheads and less need to carry out
expensive research and development. Over 3,000 clone manufacturers operate
in Taiwan alone.
There are, however, questions over the quality of these products compared
with established industry brands such as IBM, Compaq and Olivetti.
The establishment of ICPI is belated recognition by IBM that brand awareness
is rapidly giving way to price as a differentiator at the lower end of the
PC business and that it has to change radically to protect its markets.
'It is time for the computer industry to recognise that computer buyers,
like other human beings, do not make buying decisions for purely rational
reasons. How can they when all low-cost PCs are virtually the same?' says Mr
Willsher.
IBM's share of the overall PC market has plunged from about 40 per cent a
decade ago to about 12 per cent; in the UK alone, its share has fallen from
26 per cent in 1989 to 15 per cent today
But growth is fastest at the low end, where machines are priced in the UK at
less than Pounds 1,000 (Dollars 1,830), and expanding at a rate of 45 per
cent a year in Europe, against 21 per cent for the whole PC market,
according to Mr Willsher.
There has also been a marked change in the way PCs are distributed.
A growing proportion of PCs are sold through direct distribution, that is,
telesales and mail order, rather than through dealers. IBM has been slow to
exploit these unfamiliar product channels.
IBM's new venture is small, with just 45 employees initially. The aim is to
be flexible and responsive to the marketplace.
It will source its products on the open market, selling through a
combination of dealer and retailer and direct distribution.
The new venture has been established in the UK, but it is seen as the
beginning of a world-wide development. A similar venture has been launched
in Canada, and a French operation opens next week.
IBM is not alone among quality manufacturers in trying to break into the low
end of the market. Compaq, a leader in high-performance systems, will launch
its own low-priced range on June 15, backed by a Dollars 10m advertising
campaign.
It will sell these systems under its own name, however, while IBM's decision
to set up a subsidiary with no overt connection with the parent is explained
by the dilemma it faces in this area of the market. It has to compete on
price, but if it sells 'clones' which prove less reliable than its
traditional product range under its own name, its credibility across its
entire range will be compromised.
Without the IBM connection, however, it is difficult to see what the new
range, called Ambra, has to differentiate it from any other range of clones.
Furthermore, it already has a low-priced machine, the PS/1, intended for
home use, with which the Ambra range could be in competition.
IBM is putting its faith in advertising to create brand awareness for Ambra.
The group has started a multi-million pound advertising campaign with the
help of Bartle Bogle Hegarty, creators of the Levi jeans commercials, which
will promote the products as 'a desirable brand that appeals to the
individual.'
The campaign involves television commercials and full-page advertisements in
national newspapers, and its theme concerns athletes striving, a far cry
from the Charlie Chaplin commercials which launched IBM's first PC.
Competitors are delighted with the campaign, which they believe will help
create awareness for the whole market segment.
But they see little threat in the new range. Amstrad points out that one of
the UK leading high street retailers - Dixons - has decided not to stock
Ambra, apparently because of a possible conflict with IBM's existing range.
Elonex, another leading UK PC maker, points out that Ambra products are not
aggressively priced.
An Elonex machine of similar configuration to an Ambra computer could work
out Pounds 75, or almost 10 per cent, cheaper.
The services and support ICPI is promoting as a sign of its reliability are
already being offered by companies such as Dell.
So the key must be IBM's marketing muscle. But is Bartle Bogle Hegarty's
appeal to aesthetic and lifestyle preferences the answer: 'they're only PCs,
for heaven's sake,' said one commentator scornfully.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DANZAS, the transport services group, said its group pre-tax profit tumbled
19 per cent last year to SFr46m (Dollars 31.7m), because of squeezed margins
in France and organisational problems in Basle and in Austria.
Mr Bernd Mensinger, chairman, forecast a recovery this year, but warned that
next year's profits would be hurt by the elimination of customs procedures
between European Community countries.
As usual, Danzas revealed a curious mixture of group and parent company
figures. Consolidated group revenues in 1991 rose 13.9 per cent to
SFr10.2bn. Other group figures merely represented compilations, not a true
consolidation, Mr Peter Wagner, finance director, said. Full consolidated
figures would be published for 1993 results, he said.
The parent company, which covers operations in Switzerland, parts of France
and almost all of Italy, had net income of SFr14.3m in 1991, up 6 per cent.
Sales rose 11.8 per cent to SFr3.8bn.
Mr Mensinger said Danzas would decide early next year on whether to simplify
the terms covering shareholdings.

FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Pechiney agrees to sale of
nuclear-related businesses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government has asked Pechiney, the state-controlled aluminium
group, to sell for FFr2.2bn (Dollars 411m) its nuclear-related businesses,
in a reorganisation of one of the world's leading nuclear industries.
Pechiney has agreed to sell nearly all its nuclear businesses by the end of
the month to Framatome, France's monopoly builder of nuclear reactors, and
Cogema, the nuclear fuel retreatment group.
The companies for sale are Comurhex, a fuel refining group; FBFC, a fuel
producer; and Zircotube, a maker of zirconium tubes used in corrosion
resistant fuel claddings. In addition, Pechiney is selling a 50 per cent
stake in Cezus, the world's largest zirconium producer, to Framatome and
Cogema jointly, with an undertaking to sell them the rest at the end of
1994.
Pechiney's withdrawal from the nuclear industry, which accounted for 3 per
cent of its sales last year, leaves France with two nuclear industrial
groups: Cogema, which specialises in the fuel cycle from mining to
enrichment transport and waste storage; and Framatome, which makes reactors,
fuel and related products.
Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, industry minister, said the idea was to simplify
the industry's organisation to help it form international alliances.
Pechiney agreed to the nuclear disposals because it accepted it 'did not
have the right cards in its hand to follow its strategy in the long term' in
that sector, said Mr Jean Gandois, chairman. The French nuclear industry
needed 'fewer players, each with better defined powers'.
The businesses involved contributed between FFr130m and FFr140m to
Pechiney's FFr820m profits, and FFr2.2bn to its FFr74.4bn turnover last
year. This did not include Cezus, which remains a Pechniney subsidiary, with
Pechiney controlling of its titanium unit until its disposal is complete in
two years.
Cogema's sales, FFr21.7bn last year, will rise by between 6 and 7 per cent
thanks to the deal, while Framatome's nuclear-related turnover, FFr8.5bn in
1990, will grow by between 10 and 15 per cent.
Pechiney has been involved in the nuclear industry since the end of the
Second World War, when it was asked by the atomic energy commission to make
graphite for early experimental reactors. However, this has always been a
small part of its business. Mr Gandois said the cash would be used to reduce
Pechiney's borrowings of more than FFr20bn.

FT  10 JUN 92 / International Company News: Deutsche Airbus turnover climbs
18% to DM5.1bn

<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE AIRBUS, one of the two biggest partners in the consortium that
builds Airbus civil aircraft, saw turnover rise 18.3 per cent last year, to
DM5.1bn (Dollars 3.2bn).
Profits for 1991 were DM421m, compared with a 1990 loss of DM376m. Profits
this year, however, would be lower than in 1991, warned Mr Hartmut Mehdorn,
president, despite higher sales.
He attributed the improvement mainly to higher deliveries of parts for
Airbus and Netherlands aircraft company, Fokker, as well as cost-cutting.
The company is retaining this year's profits to help rebuild equity capital
and reserves.
Mr Mehdorn said it had used international currency futures markets in an
attempt to limit the effect of exchange rate fluctuations on its profits.
Aircraft sold internationally are paid for in dollars and the Airbus
programme accounts for 80 per cent of turnover.
The company is 80 per cent-owned by Dasa, the aerospace division of
Daimler-Benz. It has been trying to establish more Airbus production lines
in Germany. It said final assembly of the new Airbus model, the A319, would
'strengthen the position of the German aeronautics industry in Europe'.
Dasa will acquire the 20 per cent of Deutsche Airbus it does not own from
the state-owned Reconstruction Loan Corp (KFW) in 1996.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CASINO, the French distribution group best known for its hypermarkets and
supermarkets, is creating one of the largest forces in French food retailing
by buying the food interests of its competitor, Rallye.
The details of the financing have yet to be announced. However, Casino,
which has expanded rapidly in France through a series of acquisitions, will
pay for the Rallye businesses in shares. After the deal is completed
Rallye's present shareholders will own 30 per cent of the enlarged Casino
group.
The deal forms part of the ongoing trend towards consolidation in the French
retail sector. Late last year Pinault, the ambitious distribution company,
took control of the Au Printemps group which includes the department stores
and the Conforama chain of furniture stores.
Casino, which is chaired by Mr Antoine Guichard, is buying the food
retailing and restaurant interests owned by Rallye. The combination of the
two businesses will create a company with annual sales of around FFr65bn
(Dollars 12.1bn) and a workforce of 57,000.
The new group, according to Casino, will be the second biggest food retailer
in France, after Carrefour. It will include 101 hypermarkets - 44 of which
now belong to Rallye - , 480 supermarkets, 2,344 mini-markets and 221
cafeterias.
Casino said the addition of the Rallye businesses would give it the size it
needs to protect its position in France, before expanding in the European
Community.
Mr Guichard recently announced that Casino, which made net profits of
FFr531m on sales of FFr42.4bn in 1991, planned to invest FFr2.3bn in its
distribution activities. The group has embarked on a disposal programme -
which includes investments in manufacturing, the Hippopotamus restaurant
chain, and petrol retailing - to raise capital for investment.
When the deal is completed, Rallye will be left with its clothing shops and
sportswear companies, Athlete's Foot and Go Sport.

<TEXT>
AETNA Life &amp; Casualty, one of the largest US composite insurance companies,
is selling its reinsurance subsidiary to a buy-out vehicle for about Dollars
1.4bn.
The deal still requires regulatory approvals. If these are forthcoming, the
sale will represent a rare leveraged transaction in the US insurance
industry. It would also be one of the largest deals for months in the
dormant leveraged buy-out (LBO) market.
The buy-out company, called American Re-Insurance, has been formed by
Kohlberg, Kravis Roberts, the buy-out specialists, and the reinsurance
subsidiary's management. Aetna first disclosed that it was talking to KKR
about a buy-out in mid-April. Speculation on the price-tag had centred
around Dollars 1.4bn.
Aetna will get Dollars 1.21bn in cash at the closing date and up to Dollars
20m more in December. Aetna also receives Dollars 100m principal in
subordinated notes issued by American Re-Insurance, and Dollars 70m in 14
per cent pay-in-kind preferred stock. Aetna will keep most of American
Re-Insurance's UK-based operations, with a book value of Dollars 30m, and
take about Dollars 30m of ordinary shares in the buy-out company.
The deal will be financed by a mixture of equity, bank facilities and
publicly-traded debt securities. KKR said commitment letters had been
received from Chase Manhattan, Continental Bank and Westpac for senior bank
borrowings of Dollars 650m, and that Dollars 350m of debt securities would
be sold by Merrill Lynch.
Aetna bought the reinsurance company for Dollars 389m in 1979 and carries it
on its books at Dollars 740m. Assets of American Re-Insurance at
end-December were Dollars 3.8bn, and 1991 profits totalled Dollars 133m.
The sale follows a string of restructurings and asset sales by large US
insurers, attempting to bolster reserves and improve profits.

<TEXT>
GALERIES Lafayette, one of France's most famous chains of department stores,
is launching a FFr718m (Dollars 134.2m) offer for the remaining shares in
Nouvelles Galeries, the retailing group it won control of last year after a
fierce takeover battle.
Galeries Lafayette paid an estimated FFr2.15bn last summer for a controlling
72.5 per cent holding in Nouvelles Galeries' voting shares. It is offering
FFr650 a share for the remaining 1.1m shares. Nouvelles Galeries owns a
string of regional department stores and controls the BHV store in the
Marais area of central Paris.
A group of Nouvelles Galeries' major shareholders - including Societe
Generale and Banque Nationale de Paris, the big French banks, and Devanlay,
the textile group that battled against Galeries Lafayette in last year's bid
 -have already accepted the offer. Devanlay fought for two months against
Galeries Lafayette for control of Nouvelles Galeries in a battle that wound
up in the law courts.
Galeries Lafayette is offering the same price - which is significantly
higher than the FFr563 at which Nouvelles Galeries' shares were suspended
yesterday - to the public shareholders who control the remaining 496,298
shares in a public tender offer.
The offer for Nouvelles Galeries comes shortly after the takeover of Au
Printemps, the chief competitor to Galeries Lafayette in the French
department store sector, by Pinault, the acquisitive distribution group.
Other leading French department stores - including Au Bon Marche, a
subsidiary of Mr Bernard Arnault's Agache, and Samaritaine - are engaged in
aggressive marketing campaigns to protect their positions.
Galeries Lafayette, which has opened a flagship department store on Fifth
Avenue in New York, recently forecast a doubling of net profits, from
FFr84.8m in 1990 to FFr177.2m in 1991, on total turnover of FFr17.5bn.

<TEXT>
VIAG, the fast-growing German conglomerate, is to enter the international
shipping, freight and warehousing business through the purchase of a
one-third stake in Kuhne &amp; Nagel (K&amp;N).
The German group, which is understood to have an option on a further 10 per
cent, will shepherd the Swiss-based concern to a flotation within the next
three years.
The deal constitutes a rapid change of partners for Mr Klaus-Michael Kuhne,
sole owner of K&amp;N since the start of this year, when he bought back a 50 per
cent stake held by the Lonrho group.
K&amp;N sales last year rose 13.4 per cent to SFr4.8bn (Dollars 3.3bn), although
net income fell 43 per cent to SFr19.6m because of a one-off SFr23m charge
related to a reduction of the company's stakes in transport companies in
Spain and Italy.
For Viag, the move lifts its tally of 'core' businesses to eight. It
presently relies on electricity and gas production and distribution for
around half its earnings. Other mainstream operations include aluminium and
chemicals. Group sales and earnings rose over 20 per cent last year, thanks
mainly to acquisitions.

Turnover advanced 11 per cent to IPounds 189.3m (Pounds 171.3m), largely
reflecting an initial contribution from Food Industries, the grain trading
and malting business bought for IPounds 58.5m last November from the Goodman
group.
The result was achieved despite increased interest charges of IPounds 4.74m
(IPounds 2.91m) resulting from the purchase.
Sugar sales of IPounds 59.6m were down by 7 per cent, largely due to lower C
quota exports this year - non-subsidised exports outside of the EC and sold
at near-cost.
Sugar operating profits advanced by 24 per cent to IPounds 11.9m. However,
Mr Kevin O'Sullivan, chief financial officer, said higher C quota sales
later this year would result in lower profits growth in the second half.
Agribusiness provided the largest contribution to turnover with IPounds
71.7m (IPounds 60.3m) but operating profits in the generally difficult
climate were IPounds 5.56m (IPounds 4.61m).
Food division operating profits were IPounds 3.43m (IPounds 3.07m) on
turnover of IPounds 58.1m (IPounds 47.1m).
Mr O'Sullivan said 'there is a strong underlying profit improvement due to
greater efficiency and new investment'.
Over the past few years IPounds 20m has been invested each year in new plant
and equipment. A further IPounds 20m will be invested in the current year,
half of it in the sugar sector.
'This will be the last year at these levels as most of the investment
programme in sugar production will have then been completed. It is a very
cash generative sector so we expect improved profits performance as a
result', he said.
Sugar contributed 31 per cent of group turnover and 57 per cent of operating
profits.
A new payment formula with beet growers was worked out earlier this year,
but is not reflected in the first half figures. Mr O'Sullivan said that it
may result in additional revenue of between IPounds 1m and IPounds 1.5m for
growers during the next harvest.
Greencore was in the market for a large acquisition 'in the UK or Europe' in
its core businesses of bulk food processing of sugar, malt or flour, Mr
O'Sullivan said.
Earnings per share dipped to 16p (17.3p) as a result of dilution in the
flotation. As forecast, the interim dividend is 3p.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bandage boom boosts Seton to Pounds 4.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANDAGE business is booming for Seton Healthcare, inventor of the
tubular bandage which yesterday revealed a 60 per cent jump in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 4.8m, on sales just 19 per cent higher at Pounds 36.2m.
The sharp rise in profits for the year to February 28 was largely due to a
series of acquisitions in the healthcare division.
However, Mr Iain Cater, chief executive, said underlying sales growth in
that business had been 14 per cent last year. The underlying growth in
Seton's smaller sports and leisure division was 11 per cent.
Seton, which came to the market in July 1990, raised the total dividend by
16 per cent on a pro forma basis to 5.1p, after the final pay-out of 3.6p.
Fully-diluted earnings per share rose by 18 per cent to 14.7p, despite a
Pounds 2.7m placing of 1.1m shares in November, and the issue of a further
409,000 as part of an acquisition.
Seton purchased four companies - one after the year-end - at a total cost of
Pounds 9.2m, pushing current borrowings up to about Pounds 7m. However,
interest cover - which was 6.8 times at the end of February - was expected
to rise to 9 times in the current year.
Capital expenditure last year came to Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 2.2m), with a
further Pounds 7m (Pounds 5m) written off to goodwill.
Seton pulled out of the US and France resulting in an extraordinary charge
of Pounds 1.6m. However, Pounds 1.4m of this was due to the new accounting
standard requiring goodwill charges previously written off to reserves to be
included in the profit and loss account.
The sport and leisure division held sales at about Pounds 5.5m, although
pre-tax profits were down by 20 per cent to Pounds 563,000.
COMMENT
Forty years after founder Mr Ivor Stoller hitched his star to an elastic
sock, the company proves it can still profit from injury. The brand-led
acquisitions appear to be settling in well, with sales already 25 per cent
ahead at Lyofoam. Further benefits are expected next year from the move to
allow nurses to prescribe medications - a market which Seton has taken great
pains to clinch with its support staff of 20 nurses. Expect more
acquisitions towards the end of the year which, if the track record holds,
should prove beneficial. Forecasts are for pre-tax profits of about Pounds
6m, but the share price, on a prospective p/e of 17.8, is more than up with
events.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Marston flat after free trade debts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAD FREE trade debts hit full year pre-tax profits from Marston, Thompson &amp;
Evershed, the Burton-on-Trent brewer in which the Whitbread Investment
Company is seeking to reduce its 31.4 per cent stake.
Profits for the year to March 28 fell 18 per cent, from Pounds 18.3m to
Pounds 15.1m, after exceptional debt charges of Pounds 4.7m and redundancy
costs of Pounds 700,000.
Profits were 11.5 per cent higher before the debt charges which are now
expected to return to 'normal levels' of less than Pounds 1m a year.
Mr Michael Hurdle, chairman, said no discussions were being held at the
moment about the WIC stake which has to be cut to at least 15 per cent by
November to comply with the government's beer orders.
'A number of supposedly potential purchasers of the stake have initiated
informal conversations with us over the last few months,' he said, 'but to
date we have received no firm proposals.'
Any hostile bidder would need a 'deep war-chest,' Mr Hurdle added. 'We are
utterly committed to pursuing our own strategy as an independent vertically
integrated brewer and retailer.'
Trading profits of Pounds 20.4m were 7.4 per cent higher on turnover ahead 8
per cent to Pounds 116m. Though beer volumes declined in line with the
industry by more than 6 per cent, the effect was more than offset by
improvements in margins.
Beer sales through Whitbread fell by nearly 20 per cent but volume growth in
other national accounts was 17 per cent higher.
The group was now focusing on a smaller number of brands which it expected
to benefit from wider distribution through reciprocal trading agreements
concluded recently with five other brewers. The agreements will also improve
consumer choice in Marston's 866 pubs.
pubs increased ahead of expectations, and the 29 catering houses more than
doubled earnings. Food sales of Pounds 8.6m now amounted to nearly 25 per
cent of the total managed estate's turnover.
Volumes in the tenanted estate declined 7 per cent, underlining the severity
of the recession.
Earnings per share dipped to 12.26p (14.44p) but a final dividend of 3.57p
raises the total to 4.91p (4.46p).
Morland, the Thames Valley-based brewer facing a Pounds 101m takeover bid
from Greene King, yesterday announced a reciprocal trading deal with
Everards, the Leicester brewer. Everards will introduce Morland's Old
Speckled Hen beer to its 143 pubs and free trade customers in the east
Midlands, and Morland will distribute Everards Tiger Best Bitter.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Doubled order book behind Vosper rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VOSPER THORNYCROFT, the warship designer and builder, reported a 12 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for the year to end-March on the back of an
order book which has doubled to more than Pounds 700m.
The Southampton-based group increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 14.3m to
Pounds 16.1m despite an exceptional Pounds 3.33m (Pounds 1.48m) charge.
Sales rose from Pounds 140m to Pounds 157m with exports accounting for 65
per cent of turnover. The shares rose 25p to close at 325p.
Two steel shipbuilding contracts, one for two 83 metre corvettes for Oman
and the other for four 56 metre fast strike craft to Qatar, helped boost
last year's Pounds 350m order book to significantly more than Pounds 700m.
The group is still waiting for the go-ahead to build a fourth minehunter for
Saudi Arabia.
New orders mean the group is unlikely to make as many redundancies as it
feared and so far only 100 of the 350 expected job losses have materialised.
Earnings per share rose to 34.8p (31.2p).
An increased final dividend of 9p (7.875p) makes a total of 13.1p (11.375p).
COMMENT
The City's prosaic view of Vosper Thornycroft can be summed up thus: it's
building warships; it's affected by the government's Options for Change
Review; exports are growing. Result: two minuses, one plus. Right? Wrong.
This year exports will take more than 90 per cent of its orders,
ameliorating the normal risk associated with UK-based defence companies. In
spite of three acquisitions cash balances have increased from Pounds 34m to
Pounds 51m as productivity - measured by the number of man hours it takes to
build warships - increased by 50 per cent. If the group was viewed as an
engineering company instead of a defence related one its shares would be a
lot more expensive. Forecast pre-tax profits of Pounds 20m and earnings of
44p (there will be no exceptional charge for redundancies next year) put the
shares on a prospective multiple of just over 7 - a 44 per cent discount to
the market. If the company was about to launch a rights issue, British
Aerospace style, then the shares might be fairly priced. But since it is not
there must be a strong case for believing they are good value.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Brent Walker forms joint venture with
Labatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABATT, the Canadian brewer, and Pubmaster, Brent Walker's public house
operation, yesterday announced the creation of a joint venture company to
acquire and run a national estate of 1,000 pubs, writes Philip Rawstorne.
Houses run by the new company, Maple Leaf Inns, will stock Labatt's beer
brands which will also be distributed through Pubmaster's existing estate of
1,974 pubs.
The agreement - which follows similar deals by Labatt with Eldridge Pope,
the Dorset brewer, and Paramount Inns in northern England - is expected to
increase the Canadian brewer's sales in the UK by about 25 per cent to
500,000 barrels a year.
'Labatt has shown very rapid growth since its UK launch four years ago,'
said Mr Bruce Peer, president of the group's European operations.
'Our job now is to consolidate our position as one of the UK market's
leading brands before expanding elsewhere in continental Europe, where we
already own the Moretti brewery in Italy,' he added.
Pubmaster, which has increased its estate by 80 per cent this year through
leasing deals with Allied-Lyons and Whitbread to become the UK's largest
independent pub operator, will manage the joint venture houses under its
Threshold Inns and Tap &amp; Spile banners.
'Our intention is to continue growing the Pubmaster estate beyond 3,000
pubs, creating further business opportunities for Labatt,' said Mr John
Brackenbury, Pubmaster's chairman.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Marshalls makes Pounds 20m cash call to
fund low cost acquisitions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SECOND building materials company within a week has announced a rights
issue to finance acquisitions.
Marshalls, the Halifax-based concrete, stone and clay products is proposing
to raise Pounds 20m.
Mr Andrew Marshall, chairman, said the company proposed to take advantage of
low selling prices for building material businesses at the bottom of the
construction cycle.
Shareholders are being offered 27.7m shares on a 1-for-5 basis at 75p.
Holders of the convertible preference can take up 18 shares for every 125
preference held.
The group also reported slightly lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 12.5m in
the 12 months to the end of March compared with Pounds 12.7m. Turnover fell
from Pounds 184.4m to Pounds 174.4m.
The shares rose by 1p to close at 98p following yesterday's announcement.
Last week Blue Circle, Britain's biggest cement company announced plans to
raise Pounds 241.6m in a rights issue. The proceeds were to be used to
acquire Compagnie Internationale du Chauffage (Celsius), France's biggest
manufacturer of domestic heating equipment.
Marshalls said that it had identified several possible 'in-fill'
acquisitions to increase its range of concrete and clay products and take it
into parts of Britain where it currently made little impact.
One possible option would be to acquire some of the brick interests in
southern England which Redland has been ordered by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission to dispose of following its acquisition of Steetley, a
rival building materials group.
Mr Marshall said: 'A number of companies are in the process or reorganising
and looking to dispose of peripheral and unwanted businesses. Prices for
some of these subsidiaries are up to 50 per cent cheaper than they would
have been if they had been sold when the UK construction market was at its
peak.'
At first the rights money would be used to cut net debt from Pounds 41.2m to
Pounds 21m, reducing gearing from 42.5 per cent to 18 per cent. Marshalls
expected gearing to settle down at about 30 per cent after making
acquisitions.
A maintained final dividend of 3.75p is proposed making an unchanged total
for the year of 5p. Earnings per share were 4.33p (4.88p) basic or 5.9p
(6.28p) fully diluted.
Mr Marshall said that there were signs that the housing market was beginning
to pick up but this had still not shown through in group sales. The outlook
for the construction industry remained depressed.
COMMENT
It makes sense to be considering acquisitions at this stage in the cycle and
no doubt there are bargains to be had by the shrewd purchaser. Marshalls,
however, has had rather an indifferent investment record recently. The
Armitage brick business was acquired at an inflated price at the top of the
cycle while the lossmaking Trent jetfloor concrete flooring operation
initially struck serious technical problems. These largely have been
resolved but sales are now suffering as a result of the collapse of
commercial and industrial property markets in the UK. The rights shares,
however, are being sold at a sufficient discount and yield to ensure the
success of the issue. The profits outlook continues to look depressed with
about a third of group sales ending up in commercial and industrial
developments. Pre-tax profits approaching Pounds 13m would put the group on
a prospective p/e of about 17, which is high enough at this point.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Murray Enterprise asset values increase
sharply
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCCESSFUL PUBLIC listings of two of its investments helped Murray
Enterprise increase net asset value by 45.6 per cent over the six months to
March 31 and by 84.4 per cent over the year.
Net asset value of this investment trust stood at 129.6p per share on March
31 1992 against 89p on September 28 1991 and 70.3p on March 31 1991.
Two investments in the US, Fleet Call, a mobile communications company, and
Envoy, an electronic transaction processing company, together accounted for
more than 50 per cent of the net assets in March and their listings were
largely responsible for the rise in net asset value.
A final and exceptional dividend amounting to Pounds 235,000, payable as a
result of the receipt of non-repeatable dividends, was approved after
publication of the results to September 30 1991.
However the actual amount of dividend per share cannot be calculated until
it is known how much loan stock will be converted to shares on June 30.
Earnings per share came out at 0.46p (4.36p).

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Efficiency drive bolsters Unigate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIGATE, the food and transport group, showed some early benefits from its
efficiency drive in the underlying 6 per cent rise in profits contained in
the results for the year to end March.
The shares, however, have already risen this year and met some
profit-taking, falling 8p to 344p.
The reported pre-tax profit of Pounds 92.2m was 22 per cent up on the Pounds
75.5m achieved the year before, but there were distortions in the earlier
figure which was struck after losses of Pounds 16.3m from businesses which
have since been sold or are being run down.
Losses in the latest financial year from these activities have been set
against provisions, set up in a Pounds 117.4m extraordinary charge the
previous year. In addition, property profits of Pounds 5.4m in 1990-91 fell
to Pounds 200,000 in 1991-92.
Mr Ross Buckland, the chief executive who joined in October 1990, said that
good progress had been made but the recession had been unhelpful. He hoped
for faster progress in the current financial year.
Group turnover was 11.6 per cent lower at Pounds 1.89bn and trading profits
rose 4.6 per cent to Pounds 91.3m. Associates, mainly the Nutricia baby food
business, contributed Pounds 13.7m (Pounds 11.1m).
Earnings per share rose 22 per cent to 27.3p and an unchanged 9.6p final
dividend is proposed to give a maintained total of 15.3p. Dividend cover is
1.8.
The dairy business increased trading profits by 7.9 per cent to Pounds 28.7m
as the benefit of capital investment began to come through. Fresh food
profits fell from Pounds 21m to Pounds 19.9m because of costs of
rationalisation and new product launches. Farm foods profits nearly halved
to Pounds 6.6m (Pounds 12.3m). This division used to include the disastrous
JP Wood chicken business sold early this year.
COMMENT
There is some encouragement in these figures for those minded to be bullish
about Unigate's recovery. There is little point now in arguing about the
accounting treatment of the withdrawals, it is enough that those problems
have been dealt with once and for all. No doubt Mr Buckland has further
disposals in mind, but he is keeping quiet about what until the market for
businesses improves. There is still much to be done to get Unigate's margins
up to scratch, but work put into fresh foods, bacon, and the US shows the
management's intentions. Longer term strategy may still be rather foggy, but
a pre-tax figure of over Pounds 100m for the current year puts the shares,
on 11.5 times earnings, at a discount to the market. With the prospect of a
small dividend increase this year as well, they have some attractions.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Nationwide tumbles to Pounds 201.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at Nationwide, the second largest UK building society,
tumbled by 29 per cent to Pounds 201.9m in the year to April 4.
The fall reflected provisions of Pounds 235.9m against doubtful loans, the
highest such charge in the industry.
Operating profits before provisions were up from Pounds 379.5m to Pounds
437.8m.
Mr Tim Melville-Ross, chief executive, said the results showed that the
society had managed to stem the decline in its losses arising from
unparalleled difficulties in the housing market last year.
Analysts agreed that the result was better than had been feared. 'There are
signs that despite another disappointing result, Nationwide is on course for
improvement,' said Mr John Wriglesworth, building society analyst at UBS
Phillips &amp; Drew.
Total assets were up by 9.6 per cent to Pounds 34bn, while net mortgage
lending was down to Pounds 2.6bn (Pounds 3.5bn). Retail savings were up from
Pounds 23.5bn to Pounds 25bn. About 23 per cent of funding is now raised on
the wholesale money markets rather than through deposits.
The interest margin narrowed slightly, from 2.35 per cent to 2.21 per cent.
Losses at Nationwide Estate Agents were reduced from Pounds 15m to Pounds
12m.
On other fronts there were signs of improvement. The cost:income ratio fell
for the fourth year in succession to 55.2 per cent. There was a 31 per cent
increase in income from fees and commissions to Pounds 255.6m, mostly
achieved through the sale of insurance through its branches.
The society has also maintained a strong capital ratio. The Tier 1 capital
ratio is now 8.45 per cent (8.34 per cent) and is expected to rise to 8.7
per cent shortly when the society goes ahead with an issue of permanent
interest-bearing shares in London.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BSS funds Cadel purchase with Pounds 16m
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BSS GROUP will become the second largest distributor in the domestic heating
market, after Wolseley, with the Pounds 19.1m purchase of Cadel from Meyer
International.
It is, however, a market that has been hard hit by recession and Cadel has
incurred operating losses of more than Pounds 10m in the past two years.
BSS is funding the purchase with a Pounds 16.2m rights issue on a 1-for-4
basis, priced at 330p a share.
Its share price fell 39p to close at 378p yesterday.
BSS is acquiring only 37 of Cadel's 50 remaining branches, mainly in
Scotland, the north-east of England and the Midlands. The remaining ones are
being closed by Meyer.
Mr Ian Phillips, chairman, said BSS had selected outlets on two grounds: to
extend the group's national coverage and to take the more profitable sites.
With a total of 58 outlets, its share of the domestic heating sector would
amount to 14 per cent. The chain was established through the acquisitions of
Heatek and Labone in 1989. The merged business had a turnover of about
Pounds 55m last year.
BSS said the section of the Cadel chain that it was buying made a trading
profit of Pounds 1.77m on turnover of Pounds 67.8m last year. It was paying
a Pounds 6m discount to the Pounds 25.1m net assets.
It was taking on all of Cadel's stock, debtors and creditors. By reducing
the working capital and phasing the payments for the business, the Pounds
16.2m raised should cover the cost of the acquisition, Mr Phillips said.
At its March 31 year-end, net debt had fallen to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds
20.3m), gearing of 38 per cent.
The group also announced yesterday a 25 per cent decline in pre-tax profit,
from Pounds 13.3m to Pounds 10m, on sales of Pounds 209.2m (Pounds 219.7m).
This was after a near Pounds 1m cut in interest costs to Pounds 1.88m.
Earnings per share fell to 31.8p (41.6p). A final dividend of 11.5p makes an
unchanged total of 17.25p.
BSS also operates more than 60 branches serving the industrial and
commercial markets.
It said those had continued to weaken and were expected to remain in
recession until next year. However, it believed the domestic heating and
plumbing market would start to recover later this year.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Continental sales help Powerscreen to
Pounds 18.8m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SALES GROWTH in continental Europe helped Powerscreen International, the
Northern Ireland-based maker of screening and crushing equipment, to
increase annual pre-tax profit to Pounds 18.8m.
The advance, from a restated Pounds 15.8m, followed a 22 per cent rise in
turnover to Pounds 88.1m (Pounds 72.3m) in the year to March 31. It was the
company's fifth year of profits growth.
Mr Shay McKeown, chief executive, said the Continent's share of sales had
risen from less than 12 per cent in 1988 to 28 per cent last year. Germany
had been a strong market, particularly for the recycling of material to lay
as a base for new infrastructure.
North America still accounted for the largest proportion of sales with 39
per cent. Guzzler, which makes truck-mounted suction equipment for waste
removal, was in for a full year instead of eight months. Under Powerscreen's
ownership it had broken into the municipal market for cleaning sewers.
Two more recent acquisitions, Finlay and Matbro in the UK, contributed 12
per cent of sales and Pounds 300,000 to pre-tax profit, which was better
than expected.
Product development had been another important part of the group's growth.
The Powerscreen Commander, which gives a three-way split in the screening of
aggregates, had built up to 17 per cent of group sales since its 1988
launch.
Mr Barry Cosgrove, finance director, said new subsidiaries brought in about
Pounds 7.5m debt. Nevertheless, the group finished the year with a small
amount of cash in hand, compared with Pounds 2m net cash in March 1991.
The previous year's figures were restated because it had been decided to
write off research and development spending in the year it was incurred
instead of capitalising it.
With extra shares in issue and a higher tax charge, fully diluted earnings
per share rose 9 per cent to 16.1p (14.8p). A final dividend of 4.3p makes a
total of 6p (5.55p).
COMMENT
Powerscreen has proved to be one of the best recession-beating stories in
the engineering sector. Years of work on overseas markets have built up
non-UK sales to 73 per cent. Its products can handle a variety of materials,
from rubble and coal to sewage, and its specialisation in mobile machines
has proved difficult to compete with. Where it has been affected by
slackening demand, it has limited the damage. Machine volumes at Powerscreen
and Brown Lenox, its two biggest subsidiaries, were 2-3 per cent down last
year, whereas it is estimated the building and construction market in
western Europe and North America fell 15 per cent. Mr McKeown reckons that
these two offshoots will provide the main sources of growth this year,
particularly as the US recovers. Pre-tax profit is forecast to top Pounds
22m - giving a prospective multiple of 15, in line with the market. This
represents a substantial re-rating as the shares have doubled in value to
282p since the beginning of last year. Nevertheless, it can still be argued
that the stock deserves to trade at a premium.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Slimmer Stakis loses Pounds 3.4m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STAKIS, the hotels and healthcare group where a rescue was launched last
year by Sir Lewis Robertson, yesterday highlighted a 22 per cent improvement
in operating profits from its core businesses as evidence that its fortunes
were beginning to recover.
However, the group incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.39m for the six
months to March 29.
That compared with losses of Pounds 45.1m last time after exceptional costs
of Pounds 43.7m.
Excluding the exceptional item, the pre-tax loss was roughly doubled,
reflecting interest payments up from Pounds 8.81m to Pounds 11.8m.
Sir Lewis became chairman last spring.
He sacked Mr Andros Stakis, the chief executive and son of Sir Reo Stakis,
the Glasgow-based company's founder and previous chairman, and embarked on
slimming the group.
In December Mr David Michels, formerly with Hilton International, became
chief executive.
Operating profit from continuing activities increased from Pounds 6.92m to
Pounds 8.41m, with operating profit in hotels rising 89 per cent to Pounds
4.7m reflecting reduced overheads and improved margins. Healthcare operating
profit doubled to Pounds 1.28m as nursing homes filled up and the business
matured.
Operating profit in casinos, which Stakis is retaining after failing to sell
them at a satisfactory price, fell 36 per cent to Pounds 2.46m because of
reduced takings from the Barracuda in London and from casinos in the north
of England.
Overall operating profit, including businesses to be discontinued, rose 13
per cent, from Pounds 7.43m to Pounds 8.38m.
Because of the decision not to sell the casinos, Stakis is still negotiating
with its 21 banks, some of them foreign, to roll over its debt, which has
declined from Pounds 215m last September to Pounds 200m.
'In practice there has been a rolling over,' said Sir Lewis, 'but the
formalities are not yet complete. The big banks have been helpful but the
convoy has to move at the pace of the slowest.'
As part of the recovery policy Stakis has sold its public houses and most of
its restaurants, and entrusted its commercial property portfolio to the
management of Co-ordinated Land and Estates, which has so far achieved sales
of Pounds 4.5m.
Losses per share were 1.24p (16.22p) and no interim dividend is declared
(0.45p).
Although analysts expect the group roughly to break even this year, Sir
Lewis said that 'the signs for next full year to September 1993 are at
present encouraging.'

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Vodafone rings up 11% advance

<TEXT>
VODAFONE GROUP, the mobile telephone company which was demerged from Racal
Electronics, yesterday announced that it is to double annual capital
expenditure as it reported an 11 per cent increase in profits for the year
to end-March.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 244.7m to Pounds 271.8m on the back of an
increase in sales from Pounds 536.8m to Pounds 585.3m.
Capital expenditure is expected to double this year to Pounds 120m with a
further Pounds 120m earmarked for the following year.
This is mainly to fund the switch to digital equipment, allowing
pan-European use of its portable phones, and the introduction of the next
generation of micro-cellular phones to be introduced in about 18 months.
Mr Gerry Whent, Vodafone's chief executive, said that after an initial
recovery, the economy was 'bumping along on a plateau with little sign of a
real upturn'.
The pessimistic outlook was reflected in the proportion of customers leaving
the network each year, which rose from 21 per cent to 24 per cent, although
it has currently been reduced to 22 per cent. It was 15 per cent before the
start of the recession.
Revenue per customer also fell year-on-year from Pounds 730 to Pounds 711,
although it was up on last summer's figure of Pounds 700. The total number
of subscribers The group said it had maintained its lead over Cellnet with
56 per cent of the cellular market.
Mr Whent described the micro-cellular service which it plans to introduce in
18 months as a 'reduced service at a reduced price' aimed at the retail
market. About 95 per cent of the group's present customers are businessmen.
Micro-cellular networks are being designed to compete with personal
communication networks, owned by Mercury PCN, a consortium led by Mercury
Communications and Hutchinson.
The group does not believe it will face significant competition until 1994.
Mr Whent said the group's continued growth through the recession proved the
media wrong in thinking that mobile telephones were 'yuppie inventions'. He
added: 'We do not have a single yuppie among our customers; the portable
phone is a required business tool.'
The group improved its cash position from Pounds 34m to Pounds 65m, which
reflected the increase in interest receivable to Pounds 8.3m (Pounds 2.4m).
The number of shares held in the US in the form of ADRs, has risen by 2 per
cent to 18 per cent.
Earnings per share rose to 18.38p (16.86p). A final dividend of 2.94p makes
a total of 5.8p (5.27p), excluding the special dividend paid on demerger
from Racal.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Emap calls for Pounds 77.9m to fund growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMAP, the publishing and exhibitions group, yesterday announced a Pounds
77.9m rights issue to enable it to continue with its strategy of buying and
launching new titles.
The announcement of the issue of 34.7m shares on a 1-for-4 basis at 230p
apiece accompanied pre-tax profits of Pounds 27.1m for the year to March 28,
an increase of 9 per cent on last time's Pounds 24.8m.
The figures were struck after exceptional costs of Pounds 3.75m (Pounds
7.21m). The previous year's figure was restated to take account of recent
accountancy standards recommendations about the treatment of exceptional and
extraordinary items.
The share price fell 4p yesterday to close at 281p.
Over the last three years Emap has spent Pounds 121m on acquisitions,
including a number of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's business magazines and
exhibitions.
About Pounds 65m was spent in the last 12 months. Over the same period a
further Pounds 17m was spent on launching 20 consumer magazines, four
business magazines and and seven exhibitions.
Before the rights Emap's internal budget suggested average borrowing of
Pounds 64m in the present financial year.
'The directors believe that this level of borrowing would be likely to
restrict their ability to react to acquisition and investment opportunities
in a timely and flexible fashion and that the rights issue is the most
appropriate way to remove this constraint,' the company said yesterday.
The issue is fully underwritten by Schroders and Emap said that the
sub-underwriting had been successfully completed by the end of business
yesterday.
Negotiations for a British publishing acquisition worth less than Pounds 10m
are already under way.
Emap will be looking at further expansion into continental Europe
particularly in consumer magazines. Purchases are likely to be in the small
to medium range which Emap considers to be up to Pounds 20m.
Mr Graham Ross Russell, chairman, said yesterday that all divisions
increased operating profits in the second half when overall operating profit
increased by 22 per cent. This was mostly due to cost-cutting rather than
any recovery from recession.
Mr Robin Miller, group chief executive, said that advertising had stopped
going down, 'but is so far showing no real signs of going up'. Display
advertisements were improving but jobs ads are still falling year-on-year.
Turnover was static at Pounds 269.4m (Pounds 269.3m). Net interest charges
rose to Pounds 2.93m (Pounds 1.17m). Earnings per share increased by 9 per
cent to 12.6p. An increased final dividend of 5.5p is proposed for a total
payment of 7.5p (6.9p).
Analysts are predicting pre-tax profits of between Pounds 40m and Pounds 42m
for the current year and about Pounds 53m for 1993-94.

FT  10 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Meyer tumbles 32% and sells lossmaker for
Pounds 19m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEYER International, which owns the Jewson builders' merchant chain, is
ending an expensive three and a half year long foray into heating and
plumbing distribution with the sale of Cadel to BSS Group, writes Jane
Fuller.
The extraordinary losses made on the sale, associated closures and goodwill
adjustments total Pounds 41m.
Acquired with the UBM builders' merchants branches in a part-exchange deal
with Norcros in 1988, Cadel lost Pounds 5.3m last year.
Mr Richard Jewson, Meyer's chairman, said the business had reached the point
of 'double or quits' and the group had decided 'to bite the bullet and get
out'.
With net debt unchanged at Pounds 102m at the end of March, gearing went up
from 37 to 40 per cent because of the reduction in net assets caused by the
Cadel provisions. The Pounds 19.1m phased proceeds of the sale would at
least restore gearing to the lower level.
He admitted that the Cadel venture had proved a mistake, but pointed out
that it came with UBM which had been incorporated into Jewson.
A the same time Meyer announced a 32 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 36.1m) on flat turnover of Pounds 1.13bn in the year to
March 31.
The pre-interest profit figure of Pounds 39.3m (Pounds 52.8m) included
Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 5.3m) of gains on property disposals. Net interest costs
fell Pounds 2m to Pounds 14.7m.
The 202-strong Jewson chain made an operating profit of Pounds 18.1m (Pounds
26.9m) on sales of Pounds 409m (Pounds 419m). Market share had increased,
but prices had come under severe pressure and that had continued into this
year.
Forest Products made Pounds 8.5m (Pounds 13.3m) profit on Pounds 213m
(Pounds 231m) turnover. Timber prices were no higher than in 1985.
Both subsidiaries were sensitive to the level of house moves, because of the
link with renovation and new building. The number of moves had dropped from
2.1m in 1989 to 1.2m last year. Private housing starts fell from about
220,000 in 1988 to 135,000 in each of the last two years.
PontMeyer, the Dutch subsidiary, improved to Pounds 9.7m (Pounds 7.6m)
profit on Pounds 234m (Pounds 243m) sales. The growing German business was
being incorporated into it.
Earnings per share fell to 19.2p (27.9p). An unchanged final dividend of
12.3p maintains the total at 16.5p.
COMMENT
It was mea culpa day for Meyer as Cadel made its final dents on the figures.
Yet no one suggested the business should have been kept. Mr Jewson stressed
the group would now 'stick to its knitting', namely the strong market
positions of Jewson, Forest Products and PontMeyer - with its promising
German dimension. It is a pity that they are saddled with relatively high
group interest payments as well as with severe price competition in the
yards. Critics rub salt in the wound by saying that if only Pounds 80m had
not been wasted on Cadel and the abortive bid for Travis &amp; Arnold, the
company would look wonderful. Now that it is down to its core, the question
revolves around the housing outlook. Mr Jewson did not help the bulls' cause
by saying there were no signs of recovery - and when it did come it would be
flattened by the ERM and low house values. Pre-tax profit estimates range
from Pounds 24m to Pounds 28m, excluding property, giving a prospective p/e
approaching 20 times. The price has fallen from nearly 500p last
August/September to 368p. For believers in housing recovery, it is at least
a hold.

Creditors of Polly Peck International, the collapsed fruit and electronics

administrators complete their disposals.
Coopers and Lybrand Deloitte and Touche Ross, the joint administrators, have
told the creditors in a six monthly update that the best estimate of a
return is now 11p in the pound with a lowest estimate of 3p in the pound.
This excludes any contribution from northern Cyprus or from legal actions
launched by Mr Christopher Morris, the Touche Ross administrator, against Mr

Originally the administrators had hopes of achieving a much higher figure.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Companies stir a sleepy corner as they search for the Holy
Grail: The popularity of undated preference shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK companies and banks eager to bolster their balance sheets are turning
again to undated preference shares to raise permanent capital, stirring an
area of the capital markets dormant for 20 years.
In May, Commercial Union became the first UK insurer in recent memory to
issue preference shares, raising Pounds 100m. This week Enterprise Oil is
looking to raise up to Dollars 300m (Pounds 164m) by issuing preference
shares in the US, the first UK non-bank company to raise equity capital like
this.
Preference shares pay a fixed coupon like a bond but rank below all debt
holders in the event of winding up. Interest payments can be suspended if
the company hits trouble, absorbing losses like equity if dividend payments
are passed. And because most preference shares do not have a redemption
date, holders need never be repaid.
The only recent UK issuers of preference shares were banks, stimulated by
the fine print of international banking regulation: other than ordinary
shares, preference shares are the only instrument classified as 'core'
capital.
Banks have driven the latest rash of sterling issues. National Westminster
launched a Pounds 140m preference share issue in September last year,
followed by Barings and Bank of Ireland.
From the perspective of the UK company finance director, preference shares
offer a simple way to bolster the balance sheet without diluting existing
shareholders.
'Everybody has been looking for the Holy Grail - an instrument which counts
as equity on the balance sheet, yet is non-dilutive to existing
shareholders,' commented Mr Andrew Shilston, treasurer at Enterprise Oil.
While the quest is not new, many of the more complex instruments designed to
meet the objective have proved fundamentally flawed:
Convertible preference shares incorporating a put option - allowing
investors to sell the bonds back to the company at a premium - were issued
by a number of high-flying UK companies including Saatchi &amp; Saatchi, Next
and Hillsdown.
However, as shares fell from the peak of the late 1980s, investors demanded
repayment rather than converting into ordinary shares. Supposed equity
capital became a pressing liability.
Convertible capital bonds are deeply subordinated in the manner of equity
but do not contain the dangerous premium put option. Issuers include
Sainsbury, Tesco and Tarmac.
The exact terms of issues vary, but even under old accounting rules auditors
were not always comfortable presenting convertible capital bonds as equity.
Under new rules proposed by the UK Accounting Standards Board, most
convertible capital bonds will have to be accounted for as liabilities.
Auction-market preferred shares (AMPs) are a US invention, offering
investors the chance either to sell their paper or demand a higher return at
a regular auction.
The drawback for the company is that the cost of capital rises if it runs
into problems. If an auction fails completely, with most investors looking
to offload paper, the AMPs pay a punitive interest rate. Dividends can be
suspended, but mount up for payment at a later date. Rank repaid Dollars
200m AMPs last year when a decline in its credit rating increased the cost
of capital.
As each of these structures has shown fragility, attention has switched to
the old 'plain vanilla' idea: fixed-rate, undated preference shares.
Moreover, as interest rates fall, the cost of new fixed-rate preference
capital should also fall. This has already happened in the US.
At current interest rates sterling preference shares still look an expensive
form of capital in the early years. But if companies deliver real dividend
growth, fixed-rate preference capital soon becomes cheaper to maintain than
ordinary equity.
The biggest hurdle for potential sterling issuers is finding willing buyers.
UK institutions had little appetite for undated fixed-rate instruments in
the high inflation years of the 1970s and 1980s. Instead, they wanted
equity-linked paper - such as convertible preference shares and convertible
capital bonds.
However, some institutional investors now take the view that sterling's
membership of the European exchange rate mechanism should result in lower
inflation and lower interest rates.
It could also mean a period of economic consolidation, in which companies
struggle to deliver real dividend growth. On this argument, fixed-interest
instruments - especially paper priced to reflect current interest rates and
offering a higher yield than ordinary corporate bonds - are again
investments worthy of consideration.
Few have switched substantial sums into fixed-interest securities. Most
investors still expect ordinary shares to out-perform fixed-interest
securities in the 1990s.
'The sterling preference share market is by no means unlimited. There is
still a select group of major institutions driving it,' commented Mr David
Karat, head of capital markets at Salomon Brothers in London.
But even a marginal increase in buying of fixed-interest instruments has
opened up the sterling preference share market. In addition to recent issues
by companies and banks, building societies have raised Pounds 460m over the
past year through issues of permanent interest-bearing shares. Like
preference shares, these are undated, pay a fixed rate and are deeply
subordinated.
If this trend continues, more mainstream UK companies could be raising
permanent, fixed-rate capital in either sterling or dollars. There are
certainly good arguments for doing so.
'Academic theory states that the capitalisation of enterprise should not
affect its value. In reality, there is virtue in looking at all forms of
available capital,' commented Mr Stephen Crompton, treasurer at SmithKline
Beecham, the UK-listed pharmaceuticals group.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Telegraph issues pathfinder prospectus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE offer for sale of The Telegraph, which owns the UK's largest selling
daily quality newspaper, will cut the stake held by Mr Conrad Black's
Hollinger Group from 87 per cent to 68 per cent. Hollinger will not then
sell more shares, at least until the next accounts are published.
The pathfinder prospectus issued yesterday promised investors a 10p net
dividend for the current year, up from 9p for 1991. The prospectus shows
earnings per share for 1991 were 25.4p, or 20.3p on a fully taxed basis.
Pricing of the offer will be announced in the final prospectus, to be
published on June 23. But analysts yesterday suggested the shares merited
around a market rating. That indicates a value for the group of around
Pounds 440m, with Hollinger raising about Pounds 85m. No new shares are
being issued.
Trading prospects for the group depend for the foreseeable future, the
prospectus says, on the main titles' ability to increase advertising revenue
which has been depressed in the recession. Pre-tax profits were Pounds 40.5m
in 1991, up from Pounds 38.5m in 1990 and near to the 1989 peak of Pounds
41.5m. Further ahead, The Telegraph is expected to make acquisitions in the
media.
Analysts said that the offer should not suffer seriously from the
announcement on Monday that the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers is to
be the subject of a Department of Trade and Industry investigation.
Mr Black said he felt it his duty to look at buying the Mirror but that he
was not enthusiastic at the prospect. However, Hollinger is in talks to buy
the New York Daily News, and if successful The Telegraph could take a share
of that.
The prospectus details safeguards against Hollinger misusing its majority
stake, such as having a majority of independent directors on the board and
an audit committee.
Applications in the public offer will close on July 1 and dealings should
commence on July 8. Half the 26m shares to be sold will be offered to the
British public. The rest of the shares will be placed with institutions,
mainly in the UK but also in Canada. NM Rothschild is the merchant bank to
the issue and Cazenove and Panmure Gordon are brokers.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Swedish Match to return to Sweden in Procordia deal
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROCORDIA, the Swedish food and pharmaceutical conglomerate jointly owned by
Volvo and the Swedish state, has reached a preliminary agreement to purchase
Swedish Match, the world's leading match and disposable lighter
manufacturer.
Swedish Match will become a subsidiary of Procordia's tobacco and
confectionery business, Procordia United Brands, after negotiations are
completed by the end of next month. Procordia United Brands will then have
total annual sales of at least SKr8bn (Pounds 760m) and employ nearly 10,000
workers in 20 countries.
The purchase price and other financial details were not disclosed. However,
Mr Klaus Unger, president of Procordia United Brands, said the acquisition
of Swedish Match would double its annual sales in Europe to SKr2.4bn.
Swedish Match has about 75 per cent of the UK market through its Bryant &amp;
May and Swan Vesta brands.
Mr Massimo Rossi, president of Swedish Match, said: 'We have now reached a
fine solution and feel that Swedish Match will be entering into the best
possible industrial environment.'
Mr Rossi said he would continue to run Swedish Match after the acquisition.
Swedish Match is owned by an international consortium which includes
Citicorp Venture Capital in London; Continental Holdings; the Italian
Lavajji group; and Monforte, an Italian merchant bank.
The company has passed through a number of owners since it was acquired for
SKr5.9bn as a diverse industrial group by Stora, the Swedish forestry giant
in March 1988. In November 1989 Stora sold Swedish Match consumer products,
which included Wilkinson Sword, for SKr3.93bn to a group of international
investors including Gillette of the US who registered the company in
Holland.
As a result of the deal, Swedish Match became the subject of a Monopolies
and Mergers Commission investigation in Britain which ruled in March last
year that Gillette had to undo the effect of the merger in the UK market.
Swedish Match's homecoming will appeal to many Swedes. The company holds a
sentimental place in the country's industrial history going back to the
1920s when it dominated the world match market under the Swedish
industrialist Mr Ivar Kreuger who shot himself in 1932 when his industrial
empire collapsed.

The timing of The Telegraph's red herring prospectus had a certain piquancy,
coming as it did just one day after the launch of an official investigation
into last year's big newspaper flotation, that of the Mirror Group. There
are many differences between Mr Conrad Black and Mr Robert Maxwell, the most
important being Mr Black's unblemished reputation. In today's market,
however, the sale of a minority stake in a national newspaper by a heavily
indebted owner with a record of moving assets and liabilities from one part
of his empire to another is bound to carry a discount.
Then again, the shadow of Mr Maxwell is perhaps the best reason for
supposing the flotation will prove attractive. The prospectus bulges with
the great and good: a viscount, five lords and three knights among the
non-executive directors, with Cazenove and Rothschild as advisers. The
safeguards for minority shareholders and pensioners are set out in detail.
And if Mr Black were ever tempted to pitch the price high, fellow-directors
such as the chairman of Rothschild, the managing director of Hambros and the
deputy chairman of Barclays would doubtless remind him that making a fast
buck out of Telegraph readers would hardly promote its long-term image as a
stock.
The argument over price may hang chiefly on whether the valuation should be
on the basis of yield or earnings. The former is suggested by a circulation
figure almost unchanged since 1947, the latter by the cyclical nature of
advertising revenue. Splitting the difference between a market yield and a
market p/e points to a price somewhere around 310p.

<TEXT>
At some stage Vodafone will doubtless reap the benefit of UK economic
recovery. The timing, however, appears more elusive than it did when the
company announced its interim results in November. Average revenue per
customer was Pounds 711 at the end of the financial year, above its nadir of
Pounds 700 last summer but down on the Pounds 730 recorded a year earlier.
The number of subscribers rose by 44,000 to 715,000 for the year as a whole,
but the proportion who failed to renew their subscription increased to 24
per cent from 21 per cent.
Against that background, Vodafone could claim to have done well in
increasing annual profits by 11 per cent to Pounds 272m. There was a Pounds
6m boost from higher interest income, though, in turn a function of
unusually low capital spend. On a historic multiple of more than 20, the
shares seem to be discounting an implausibly strong recovery.

FT  10 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: PowerGen
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No doubt times are getting tougher in the electricity generation business.
But PowerGen's disclosure of Pounds 88m of exceptional income yesterday is a
reminder that monopoly profits are not necessarily extinct. The figure,
which excludes a central overhead contribution, reflects the price extracted
by the company for guaranteeing essential electricity supplies to the
National Grid. At the very least it will interest Professor Stephen
Littlechild, the industry's regulator, who is busy examining complaints from
distributors that these so-called uplift charges are excessive. It might
even put pressure on National Power to set out its own numbers in more
detail next week.
Exceptionals aside, the underlying picture at PowerGen is what one might
expect. For the moment it has guaranteed margins of 15 to 20 per cent thanks
to its pre-flotation contracts, but has improved on that due to substantial
cost reductions and increased direct sales to industrial customers. The
market's focus, however, is on the re-contracting negotiations with British
Coal on the one hand and the 12 regional electricity companies on the other.
PowerGen was anxious to assure listeners yesterday that all will be well and
that the uncertainty should not be overplayed. But while this confidence
should not be discounted, the longer the talks drag on the greater the
danger that new terms will end up closer to the pool price. The generators
may appear to have British Coal over a barrel, but the regional companies
will surely be cautious until the regulator has made his position clear.
PowerGen's 11 per cent dividend increase puts the shares on an average
market yield, which seems enough until confirmation arrives that such rises
can be sustained.

FT  10 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Carsberg's last call
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is perhaps unfortunate that Sir Bryan Carsberg could not be persuaded to
be more forthcoming ahead of the BT secondary offering last year. Had he
spelt out his thinking on pricing then, investors might have proved
distinctly less enthusiastic. The review turns out harsher than expected,
not only in terms of the price cap set at 7.5 percentage points below the
rate of inflation, but also because of its interventionist tone.
BT will almost certainly have to live with the result. Sir Bryan, who
vacates his post at the end of this week, has tied the hands of his
successor to his 'no-negotiation' approach. The alternative is a protracted
Monopolies and Mergers Commission inquiry which could do considerable damage
to a public company with a market share of 93 per cent.
It would not do to lose all sense of perspective. Sir Bryan assumes a rate
of return well below the 19.3 per cent achieved last year, but the cost of
his measures, amounting to between Pounds 100m and Pounds 150m, compares
with annual profits of Pounds 3bn at present. BT has still to reap
significant gains from its rationalisation programme. Compared with the
industrial average it boasts a healthy dividend cover of more than 2 times
earnings.
There is a nagging worry just the same. In requiring BT to lay 3.5m
kilometres of optical fibre and to make digital services available to 99 per
cent of customers by 1997, Sir Bryan is limiting management's freedom to
decide the pace and application of investment. BT will face only a moderate
loss of market share at the end of the period. Indeed, the price cap may
well prove a competitive constraint on Mercury. But BT looks like remaining
at the mercy of a regulator bent on a view of his role which seems to go
beyond competition. The shares may have a little further to fall as this
point sinks in.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Core inflation slows to lowest annual rate for five years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICES of manufactured goods leaving Britain's factories rose by 3.6 per
cent in the year to May, the lowest annual rate of increase for five years.
The producer prices index, often taken as a measure of core inflation, rose
0.1 per cent on the month compared with a 0.4 per cent monthly rise in
April, supporting government hopes that upward pressure on prices will
continue to ease.
Further evidence of the disinflationary momentum in the UK economy came from
the rise in the index excluding the volatile prices of food, drink and
tobacco. This rose by 0.2 per cent in May compared with the previous month,
bringing the year-on year rate of change to 2.7 per cent, the lowest since
the late 1960s.
Producer price inflation has been falling steadily - bar a couple of upward
monthly blips - since a peak of 6.2 per cent in April 1991. It remained
above 4 per cent for the first three months of this year, dropping to 3.8
per cent in April.
The latest figures are likely to cool recent worries that underlying
inflationary pressures in the economy are proving difficult to squash. Over
the past six months the annual rate of retail price inflation - the headline
inflation figure - has stuck at above 4 per cent after dipping briefly to
3.7 per cent in October.
On Friday, the retail prices index for May is expected to show a slight rise
from April's 4.3 per cent before resuming a downward path later in the year.
The prices of raw materials and fuels used by manufacturing industry rose a
seasonally adjusted 0.1 per cent last month. Non-seasonally adjusted input
prices fell by 0.1 per cent on the month and by 0.9 per cent compared with
the same month a year ago, reflecting depressed commodity prices.
The Treasury said the figures provided further evidence that underlying
inflationary pressures were weak.
'We are on course to meet the Budget forecast that output price inflation
excluding food drink and tobacco will fall to 2 per cent in the final
quarter of 1992,' it said.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Letter: Jubilee Line extension much more than just Canary
Wharf link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Councillor SALLY KEEBLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article on the extension of the Jubilee Line ('No jubilation at
the end of the line', June 5) fails to recognise its wider benefits.
The extension would serve not only Canary Wharf but also the growing City
overspill on the south bank, and the Surrey Quays areas of Docklands, as
well as provide a much needed rail extension to Greenwich.
On a wider level it is important in the strategic development of east
London, including Stratford with its Channel Tunnel rail link with Europe.
Through its connection with the proposed East London line extension, it
would link new areas of London into the underground network - especially
those with high unemployment, including Peckham and Hackney.
Lack of proper transport facilities has long been both a bar to people in
these areas getting access to jobs elsewhere, and also a deterrent to
prospective employers moving into the area.
Councils that lie along the planned extensions of both the East London and
Jubilee Lines support the developments for very obvious social and economic
reasons. We have also won the support of private sector employers which
share our concerns that the future development and success of London will
depend on the provision of proper infrastructure  - especially transport,
The problems facing Canary Wharf should not blind planners to the fact that
London - like the Financial Times - is moving southwards and eastwards. The
underground network must move with it.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Foreign Affairs: The benefit of the doubt - Mexico has many
of the features of a one-party state, but Salinas remains its only credible
leader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
One cannot always be in the right place at the right time. Last Tuesday,
while the Danish voters were joyfully consigning their free copies of the
Treaty of Maastricht to the shredder, I was in Mexico, forming part of the
comitiva (entourage) of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari, on a visit to
the north-eastern state of Tamaulipas.
Why Mexico? I had gone there, as readers of last week's Foreign Affairs may
remember, at the invitation of the InterAction Council, the little-known
trade union for retired heads of government. Having got there, I was keen to
meet the president, having heard his policies praised as the model Latin
American success story during my pre-Earth Summit excursion to Brazil.
In Brazil, as it struggles with chronic stagflation, they speak of Mexico
with envy, even grudging respect. Mexico was where the great debt crisis
started in 1982, but today it is clearly under control. While I was there,
the finance minister was able to announce that he had reduced Mexico's
public debt to 38 per cent of the gross domestic product: a lower proportion
than in the largest industrial countries.
Inflation is in the middle teens (less than Brazil's monthly rate) and
falling; privatisation and deregulation are well advanced; foreign
investment is pouring in; negotiations for a free trade area with the US and
Canada are almost complete; and growth has resumed - although critics are
quick to point out that in per capita terms it is little more than 1 per
cent.
President Salinas is proud of the fact that population growth has fallen to
1.9 per cent per year. But even at that rate Mexico has to run very fast to
stand still. The population has more than tripled in 40 years, and here, as
throughout the Third World, the increase takes the visible form of
improvised shanty towns wherever there was vacant land in or close to the
big cities.
Several of the president's engagements during his tour of Tamaulipas were
meetings in these shanty towns, organised by the National Solidarity
Programme, which he launched the day after he took office in 1988. It sprang
from his Harvard PhD research in the 1970s, when he found that local
variations in support for the ruling party could be correlated, not with
gross social spending but with the direct involvement of the local
population in planning and implementing social programmes. In essence it is
a system of matching grants, whereby the state agrees to provide resources
for projects - schools, clinics, housing, potable water and sewage systems,
electrification, etc - which groups of poor people propose and carry out
themselves. In a period of cuts in state expenditure, it aims to allocate
scarce resources so that they stimulate and reward local initiative.
The comitiva comprised some 20 or 30 people: local politicians, junior
ministers, senior civil servants, private sector businessmen, a historian
from the Colegio de Mexico and a scientist who had done research on Aids. On
the platform at each meeting, whether in town square, factory or under the
trees of a remote farming community, each of us found a chair bearing a
typed label with his or her name on it.
From this privileged vantage point I could read the messages directed at the
president, thanking him for his support with this or that project, but also
imploring him to solve problems, uphold the rights of a Solidarity committee
against local bureaucrats or, in the oil port of Tampico, promise to build a
new refinery. (He showed his political skill by withholding that promise - a
decision for the board of Pemex, the state oil company, to take on strictly
economic criteria - and yet making the crowd cheer his assurance that 'your
friend, the president of the republic' would personally watch over their
interests.)
Occasionally one could see the banners of a small opposition party. But
conspicuous by its invisibility was the party to which Mr Salinas himself
belongs, and which has ruled Mexico almost unchallenged since its foundation
in 1929: the Partido Revolucionario Institucional (PRI). On the flight back
to Mexico City I put it to the president that this was strange. In any other
country one would expect his own party to be in the lead in welcoming the
head of state when he tours the country, especially if (as is clearly the
case with Mr Salinas) he has some popularity to cash in on.
Yes, he said, that 'used to be the tradition' in Mexico too, but party
meetings had become 'very rigid, with a lack of interest among the people .
. . because they had almost no relation with what was going on'. By
contrast, he explained, the people at the meetings I had witnessed were
'those directly related to what is going on, and are mobilised through
Solidarity committees, which are not party-related, because we are convinced
that these committees reflect the pluralistic composition of the population,
and they do not want the parties within the committees . . .'
There is no doubt that the PRI is active behind the scenes in the Solidarity
programme, as in almost everything that happens in Mexico. A colleague told
me how he came by accident on a squad of PRI militants in the midst of the
countryside, toiling to finish a school building which Mr Salinas was due to
inaugurate the following day.
Mexico still has many of the features of a one-party state. The press
remains weak, the television respectful, and the number of journalists who
meet violent deaths (not all, ostensibly at least, for political reasons)
has aroused the anxiety of PEN, the international writers' lobby. The
opposition has clearly lost ground since the 1988 presidential election,
which many believe Mr Cuauhtemoc Cardenas would have won if the votes had
been honestly counted.
Mr Salinas worries about such things, too, or anyway about the effect they
have on Mexico's image. He has set up a National Human Rights Commission,
and he says he 'would like to see more modern political parties'. At the
same time he is acutely defensive about Mexico's national sovereignty,
evidently fearing that any qualification of it might be exploited by the US,
for instance by attaching political strings to free trade.
So far the US has abstained from doing so, evidently considering that Mr
Salinas is by far the best Mexican leader it is likely to get and that
nothing would be gained by rocking his boat. 'Generally Americans like to
link economic issues with democracy and human rights,' says one
disillusioned Cardenas supporter, 'but there are three exceptions to that:
China, Mexico and Kuwait.'
To such critics the good press that Mr Salinas gets at home and abroad, and
especially the willingness of foreign liberals to give him the benefit of
the doubt, is infuriating. 'Why should what he says be taken on trust, any
more than what Bush or Major or Kohl says?' the same person asked. The
answer is that of course it should not. But the question is the wrong one.
What one should ask is whether there is an alternative leadership and an
alternative programme more likely to move Mexico in the direction of greater
prosperity and greater freedom; and there the answer can only be that if
there is one, it is not yet in sight.

Sir, Vanessa Houlder (Property Market, June 5) is not comparing like with

The situation in Croydon in the early 1970s was very similar to that of
Docklands today. Developers, having built an enormous amount of speculative
office space, faced the prospect of buildings standing vacant. It took Home
Office and the Department of the Environment intervention to save the
situation. I know. I was one of the unfortunate civil servants who had to

FT  10 JUN 92 / Letter: Regulator must act on water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From W A G SPICER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, In your article, 'And not a drop to spray: The water crisis in the UK'
(May 30), you commented on the profits and dividend increases being reported
by various water companies.
Pride of place was awarded to the East Surrey Water Company, whose profits
and dividend increased by 42 per cent and 19.5 per cent respectively. These
figures should come as no surprise given that increases applied at April 1
1990 and April 1 1991 resulted in a cumulative increase of approximately 69
per cent: the Retail Prices Index increase was only a fraction of this
figure.
In my view competition in the marketplace is an essential ingredient of the
free enterprise system. Water companies enjoy an absolute monopoly in their
supply area and were not appropriate candidates for privatisation. It is not
surprising that, at a time when many large companies subject to the rigours
of competition in a severe recession are reporting markedly reduced profits,
the water companies are prospering.
Unless there is some really effective action by the industry regulator the
prospects for the customer are bleak indeed with ever escalating charges and
little to show for it.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Time to review the regulators
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CUSTOMERS of UK utilities are almost daily assailed by headlines
alleging profiteering and poor service. Electricity generator PowerGen's
profits are up 30 per cent in the depths of a recession. Complaints about
the behaviour of the water companies have doubled. British Gas stands
accused of 'ripping off' the customer by failing to cut gas bills fast
enough as inflation falls. Are Britain's regulators doing enough to protect
the hapless consumer from the predations of monopolistic, privately owned
public utilities?
The shareholders of these utilities probably see things rather differently.
Millions of Sids who bought British Gas shares find the pricing formula
enforced with unforeseen ferocity. BT faces the third tightening of its
price cap since privatisation with ever more services subject to control.
Dividends paid to water shareholders could be restricted under proposals
that the companies should finance a higher proportion of investment through
debt. Are Britain's regulators running amok, tearing up the prospectuses
published when the utilities were privatised?
The truth lies somewhere between: Britain's regulatory system is evolving.
Experience has shown that simple 'RPI - X' price caps, which limit price
rises to X per cent below the rate of inflation, have often required
refinement to curb monopoly profits. The 'X' factor has needed to be
increased in some cases (from 3 per cent to 7.5 per cent in the case of BT).
The basket of prices encompassed by the formula has grown fuller. Quality
criteria have been added, and regulators now enforce service standards.
Social requirements
Other public policy issues have arisen. The regulator may attempt to promote
investment in infrastructure like fibre optical cabling, for example. In the
utilities which provide basic necessities, there are social requirements to
offer special services to the old and the disabled. Water prices are being
increased by more than the rate of inflation to invest in much higher levels
of water purity.
Finally, most of the regulators are rightly required to work towards their
own abolition by creating the conditions for more competitors to thrive.
Ofgas has pressed British Gas to open up more opportunities for competing
suppliers. BT is constrained in its ability to compete with cable TV
companies. The big two electricity generators face restraints on their
ability to dominate regional supply markets.
All of these are legitimate objectives for regulation, though their import
may not have been fully understood by managers or shareholders when the
companies were privatised. Equally, those involved in creating the
regulatory process may have underestimated the difficulties in applying
light touch regulation to complex industries. That is why the picture is
shifting, and why the regulators have at times appeared to move in different
directions or at different paces. While all have held on to price caps,
reflections on justifiable rates of return on capital have begun to feature.
Such evolution is desirable, and the existence of several industry-specific
regulators encourages diversity and experiment.
Little scrutiny
However, all of this can be bemusing to the ordinary consumer or investor.
There is astonishingly little scrutiny of the processes which have become so
important to household budgets and industrial competitiveness. Much more of
the information regulators use to make their decisions could be placed in
the public domain without threatening commercial confidentiality. And
parliamentary select committees could hold public examinations of the
regulators after the publication of their annual reports. The appointment of
regulators might also be subject to confirmation by these committees.
More fundamental scrutiny of each regulated utility is also needed from time
to time, with the Monopolies and Mergers Commission well-placed to carry
this out. However, the regulatory process itself also requires periodic
scrutiny to establish how it is evolving and whether it is as effective as
it can be.
The government should ask the Office of Fair Trading to review utility
regulation. Its report, rich in research and analysis, would then provide an
excellent basis for public scrutiny by a parliamentary committee. This is
the right way to build on the success of utility privatisation.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Japan's role in the world
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PARLIAMENTARY fisticuffs and filibusters notwithstanding, Japan has taken a
timid but important step towards playing a political role in the world
commensurate with its economic might.
After a sitting that lasted four days and nearly four nights, parliament's
upper house passed a bill authorising small numbers of Japanese troops to
serve in United Nations peace-keeping operations overseas. Assuming the
lower house, which agreed the bill some time ago, now passes the amended
version, Japan will be able legitimately to deploy its modest but growing
self-defence forces abroad for the first time since the second world war.
The decision was the subject of more than 18 months of bitter parliamentary
debate. During that time Japan - much to its government's embarrassment -
was unable to play anything more than a financial part in the Gulf war. The
fact that Japanese politicians have been stung into recognising the need for
a physical as well as a financial contribution to international action is
significant. It is only with this kind of experience, gathered cautiously
over a substantial period of time, that Japan will broach a serious debate
about how the country is to exercise its power in the world and its
immediate region.
Security needs
These are deep and dangerous waters, and wading into them requires
diffidence. Japan is not, for one thing, on the point of developing much of
a foreign policy of its own. Any international deployment of its forces will
be strictly wrapped in the UN flag and in all other respects Japan continues
to depend overwhelmingly on the US for its security and other foreign policy
needs.
But that observation itself begs a question which may, in the next few
years, become more insistent: how durable is the US-Japan relationship?
Japanese officials are inclined to brush such doubts aside. Equally, no
country in the region, including China, wants to see a re-emergence of Japan
as a regional power. The argument runs: if everyone wants the US to stay
then the US will stay.
This line of reasoning may be plausible, but its converse is hardly
unthinkable in a period which lacks the galvanising polarities of the Cold
War and features an unremitting stream of economic tensions which has made
Japan such a volatile factor in American politics.
The US did not find it unthinkable to shut down its previously vital naval
facilities at Subic Bay in the Philippines last year and it needs to be
borne in mind that it is encouraged to keep troops in Japan by the
substantial sums the Japanese government pays towards their upkeep.
Unsettling events
Moreover, even if the US relationship is as solid as Japanese officials
claim, they are well aware that continuing stability in their immediate
neighbourhood is scarcely guaranteed. It is not hard to think of events that
might occur in north or east Asia before the century is out, that could
seriously unsettle the entire region: from reunification of the Korean
peninsula to a large-scale upheaval in the Chinese leadership. It would be
remarkable if in all these possible crises, the US and Japan saw completely
eye to eye. The possibility of Korean unification, for example, is already
causing frissons of concern in Tokyo that seem to some observers to go
beyond America's specific worries over North Korea's nuclear programme.
Japan's substantial economic stake in the future of south-east Asia may also
eventually translate into a political approach to the region which deviates
from that of the US.
Such considerations are a far cry from the modest step into the
international arena Japan has just taken. But it is they, rather than hazy
notions of international solidarity associated with the UN, that may be the
real foreign policy preoccupations for Japan over the next few years. The
wrangling over the peace-keeping bill is a small hint of the troubles the
country has yet to face in coming to terms with its changing world role. It
is in everyone's interest that Japan's emergence as a more vigorous world
citizen is accomplished with appropriate tact.

FT  10 JUN 92 / The shrewdest deal for Docklands: The government can drive a
bargain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Environment Secretary Michael Howard has declared that the decision to move
government employees to Canary Wharf will be taken on hard-nosed value for
money grounds. But what does value for money mean when the government itself
has the power to transform the viability of the troubled development simply
by moving civil servants down-river and proceeding with the Jubilee Line?
There is a risk that Whitehall negotiators will, in the jargon of the
property market, undervalue their own 'covenant': their status as providers
of the most reliable income stream in commercial property.
The government's bargaining position at Canary Wharf is overwhelmingly
strong. There is no other comparable tenant in sight. That points to a
rock-bottom initial rent and flexible lease terms that exclude upward-only
rent reviews. But that is not enough. Simply by moving people eastward in
bulk, the government will be creating capital value. Ministers have it in
their gift to reduce the banks' write-offs and provide a profit for any
successor to the Reichmanns.
A private sector tenant in a comparable position would exploit the fact by
taking an equity interest as a reward for restoring a lame duck. There is no
reason why the government should not do the same, if enough space is taken
to alter the scheme's finances materially. Should a developer try to buy
Canary Wharf from the administrators, he would inevitably seek to treat with
government, not least in its capacity as a potential tenant. The government
would be selling the taxpayer short if it failed to respond commercially.
The negotiation of the relative equity stakes would hinge on valuations of
Canary Wharf with and without the government, adjusted for respective
contributions to the Jubilee Line. The state's equity interest could then be
subject to an agreement to sell on completion of the whole scheme.
Alternatively, it could be securitised - turned into the equivalent of a
unit trust for institutional investors just as American mortgages are turned
into mortgage-backed securities.
Yet none of this is likely to happen. First, Lord Wakeham, who co-ordinates
government efforts on Canary Wharf, has asked the administrators to
negotiate with Whitehall departments individually. This brilliantly
undermines the government's negotiating strength by inviting the opposition
to divide and rule. Then there would be practical objections about
valuation. Such things, invariably surmountable in the private sector, are
taken frightfully seriously in Whitehall. Finally, there is the ideological
hang-up. Ministers feel that entrepreneurial activity by the state
contradicts the logic of privatisation.
The government's property advisers might well respond by suggesting a less
conspicuous form of equity. It would be possible, for example, to structure
the lease so that rents rose to, say, 70 per cent instead of 100 per cent of
market value on periodic rent reviews. The snag is that while this de facto
equity would have been valuable in the inflationary property market of old,
the huge oversupply of London offices makes it of questionable worth today.
The value that the government should be seeking to capture derives less from
rental inflation than from further development many years down the line.
There are other opportunities to manage existing government assets more
imaginatively which seem equally unlikely to be grasped. A feature of
today's otherwise severe property slump is that there are plenty of buyers
for property let to first class tenants. No better tenant exists than the
government, since its creditworthiness is supported by the power to tax. At
a time when the impetus behind the privatisation of state corporations is
inevitably waning, the sale and leaseback of more government property would
be an attractive way of taking pressure off the gilt-edged market. It would
reduce funding costs and make the fiscal convergence criteria of the
Maastricht agreement - if they survive the present Danish fracas - more easy
to attain.
There are plenty of so-called trophy buildings, the kind that appeal to big
international investors, in the government's portfolio. Whitehall has a
stunning collection of them. Yet the ownership of the land, bricks and
mortar in Whitehall is still sacrosanct, untouched by the Thatcher
revolution and undisturbed by Majorism. This seems odd. Unlike the coal
industry or British Telecom, the building that houses HM Treasury is no more
than a passive asset. The only reason that the City is not humming with
plans to privatise or securitise Great George Street is that it is simply
unthinkable. The objections are all based on the idea that government
tenants are somehow different - arguably true of the Ministry of Defence,
but not of much else.
Perhaps the Number 10 policy unit could summon up a shocking thought or two,
to help ease the government's funding burden. Selling the ground from under
the Treasury would bring a whole new dimension to Whitehall's turf war.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Arts: Bach cantatas - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a matter of constant concern that not enough people, not even
dedicated music-lovers, know about the riches of Bach's cantatas. More than
two hundred cantatas, in the accepted numeration] (which is neither
chronological nor ordered in any other way, except that the 'secular'
cantatas are catalogued last.) Though a few of them are patchworks,
fragments or single numbers, or dubiously attributed to Bach, such worries
are only the business of musicologists.
Stravinsky made the essential point. Asked whether any music ought to count
as 'basic' in the Western concert-repertoire, he voted for Bach's cantatas.
His grounds, I imagine, went something like this: the cantatas exemplify at
once - and magisterially - the possibilities of Western tonal construction,
and the range of (spiritual) music-drama it affords, but without any narrow
attachment either to Viennese symphonism or to Romantic theatre. Those great
subsequent traditions may be viewed as historical and special. For all his
Lutheran commitments, it was Bach who spelled out the definitive means in a
timeless way.
The title of the South Bank series that Sir William Glock has devised for
the Orchestra and Chorus of the Age of Enlightenment - 'Bach: The Colourful
Dramatist' - underlines the point. Though Bach's period-pious texts may seem
quaint now, their sense is completely rendered in his music; by comparison,
some of Mozart's best effects sound like extra-musical theatre.
On Monday the OAE's Queen Elizabeth Hall concert, the fourth in their series
of six, ranged from the almost private soprano-meditation 'Mein Herze
schwimmt in Blut' (Cantata no. 199, delivered with bell-like sweetness by
Nancy Argenta) to the grand choral fervour of no. 79, 'Gott der Herr ist
Sonn' und Schild'. Even in the latter, rapt interjections by soprano
(Argenta again) and bass (the hugely promising Gerald Finley) supplied a
close-up personal dimension. The young German counter-tenor Andreas Scholl -
only a decade ago, he was singing one of the Three Boys in Zauberflote - was
both agile and subtle.
Martyn Hill's tenor contributed stylishly to no. 73, 'Herr, wie du willt'.
Here and there I had unenlightened reactions to the 'authentic'
playing-style: did 'period' violins (lively as they were here) so often peck
at their music, where unabashedly modern performers sculpt broad lines?
What, exactly, is the virtue of renting natural-horn devotees who keep
'splitting' on their notes, when they could deliver the music on valve-horns
with cool facility?
Still, one mustn't look this period gift-horse in the mouth. It does bear
unfamiliar subtleties of balance - and a musical democracy-of-parts that is
too often sacrificed now to the fashion for star soloists with faceless
accompaniment. The conductor of this concert was Rene Jacobs; the last two,
on June 17 and 23, will be conducted by Barthold Kuijken.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Arts: Worrying straws in the wind - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are many straws in the wind. Programmes are now turning up regularly
on screen looking as though they have been created specifically to compete
in the new market-obsessed contest which is being thrust upon British
broadcasters by the 1990 Broadcasting Act. British television is starting to
look more and more like American television, not only because there are so
many American imports (likely to increase even further as we move towards
January 1993 and the new franchises) but because British programme makers
are increasingly producing the sort of programmes favoured by American
programme makers, and for the same reasons.
Commercial broadcasters are not the only ones. In approaching the renewal of
its charter in 1996, while preparing in the shorter term for the examination
promised by the new broadcasting minister, David Mellor, the BBC clearly
feels under tremendous pressure to scrimp, save and maximise audiences in
order to prove itself more market-obsessed than its competitors. Thus we
learn that in two weeks time BBC1 will begin an ambulance-chasing series
called 999 which we are warned will 'focus on the real life drama behind
every emergency call' and will tell 'dramatic stories of real life rescue'.
Of course the bravery and selflessness of ambulancemen and lifeboatmen are
reasons for celebration, and no doubt there are heartening stories to tell.
But this series is pretty clearly inspired by the American series Rescue 911
(the British dial 999 but Americans dial 911) which all too often turns out
to be current affairs for ghouls. Last time I watched Rescue 911 the cameras
followed one poor soul all the way into casualty where, we were told, he
died on the operating table. Perhaps the British version will be less
sickeningly intrusive, and, who knows, it may not be especially cheap. But
it is hard to avoid the feeling that 999 is another move towards the sort of
ratings-led tabloid telly which BBC1 is already seeking to exploit in such
series as Crime Limited.
ITV is doing the same with Michael Winner's True Crimes which appear to be
modelled closely upon the old Edgar Lustgarten programmes. There has been
much comment about the morality of this series, and the Rachel McLean case
which was supposed to open the new batch on Saturday was postponed at the
behest of the Oxford college attended by the late Miss McLean, the
suggestion being that an account of her murder might put the undergraduates
off their exams. The notion, much pursued in other newspapers, that Winner
ought not to be allowed to 'exploit' crime in this way is, presumably,
inspired by dislike of his Death Wish vengeance movies.
But Winner's television reconstructions are less exploitive than
Shakespeare's in Richard III. Our real objection should be to the amateurish
nature of the drama which consists almost entirely of cliches. 'At last]'
says one character as a document arrives. 'It's hot off the press]' says the
other, and you can hear the exclamation marks. 'His technique was given a
baptism of fire in his own back yard' says Winner, mixing his metaphors
while stacking his cliches. This stuff is being brought to us by London
Weekend, the company previously responsible for Weekend World, Poirot and
The South Bank Show.
Similarly worrying signs are coming from Granada. This column has complained
in the past that British television drama seems transfixed by period
naturalism - all that documentary realism in steam trains, Players packets,
and Oxford bags - and weak on contemporary fantasy. The Americans, somewhat
surprisingly, given their traditional strength in modern action drama, have
proved themselves greatly superior here, from the 1950s to the present, with
series from The Twilight Zone to Quantum Leap.
Now we find Granada, the company which gave us such triumphs of period
naturalism as Brideshead Revisited and Jewel In The Crown, attempting to ape
the Americans but getting it wrong. Having offered us the very ordinary
hospital series Medics they have tried us on Angels, a 90-minute drama
involving not one but three guardian angels, played by Tom Bell, Cathy Tyson
and Eric Mallett, with Alfred Molina and Warren Clarke as two of those on
earth who become involved. Unless they were blinded by the starriness of the
cast the mystery is how those in charge at Granada ever allowed this to get
onto the network in peak hours.
Though billed as a 'comedy drama' it was consistently unfunny. Worse, it was
long winded, the three strands did not fit well together, and the plot broke
all the rules of time travel and celestial visitors. By all accounts this
was intended as a pilot for a regular series, but we would be better served
if Granada brought us another American series, provided it was as good as
the better episodes of, say, Beauty And The Beast.
There is, perhaps, less reason for suspecting that A Stab In The Dark on
Channel 4 is inspired by the desire to be ready for more cut throat
competition come 1993, though since the channel is going to cease being
supported by ITV and instead compete with its old supporter for advertising,
we certainly should not be too starry eyed. The depressing thing about this
late night Friday series, described as 'a topical programme which takes an
oblique look at the week's news, serving up anarchic and subversive topical
comment in front of a studio audience' is its pathetic safeness.
Had the producers wanted to achieve the sort of delighted shock which
greeted That Was The Week 30 years ago they could have done so by attacking
today's sacred cows: tunnel vision feminists, loopy greenies, the
politically correct apparatchiks of the Aids industry. What did they choose
instead? The House of Lords, Mark Thatcher and a book on etiquette which had
already received a much fiercer roasting from Private Eye. Picking through
celebs' dustbins and castigating the owners for not taking bottles to the
bottle bank requires less moral courage than explaining to an audience
bombarded by green hype that most bottle banking is a total waste of time
since the recycling industry can only use a tiny proportion of what is
collected, and the business is largely a feel-good charade.
The common factor in all these straws is the expectation of fiercer
competition for audiences and, in all cases outside the BBC, profits. One
more item this week may give an even more vivid hint of things to come. We
are told that Sky is planning from early 1993 to encrypt its 24-hour news
channel Sky News and its general entertainment channel Sky One and sell them
in a package with five other channels (the rock video channel MTV, the
American classic movie channel Bravo, the nature and science channel
Discovery, the Children's Channel, and the planned UK Network which is being
launched by Thames and BBC Enterprises) for Pounds 5 a month. Add that to
the Pounds 17 a month already charged for the movie channels and the Pounds
22 a month predicted for soccer and you reach an interesting total of Pounds
528 a year for the satellite services, or just over six times the BBC
licence fee.
For 'straws' read 'haystacks'.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Arts: Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If sheer machined efficiency and implacable technique were all that's
needed, the Pittsburgh Symphony Orchestra would qualify easily for the place
among the world's great orchestras it claims for itself. But there was
something utterly charmless, if not almost repellent, about the display it
gave to a capacity Royal Festival Hall audience on Monday: a demonstration
of prodigious strength in every department and seemingly inexhaustible
reserves of tonal power certainly, but little feeling of individuality or
even of corporate artistic spirit.
Comparisons with the Philadelphia Orchestra, which played in the same hall
two weeks earlier, are inevitable. Where that authentically great orchestra
certainly gave ample proof of its collective virtuosity, it was used there
as the starting point for wonderfully elegant musicianship, with beautifully
fashioned wind solos and strings blended and refined into an infinitely
malleable whole. The Pittsburgh suggests none of that; it leaves the
impression of being no more than the sum of its formidable parts, parading a
surface glare which wearies the ear on unrelieved exposure.
Whether more humanity would have emerged under a conductor other than Lorin
Maazel, the Pittsburgh's current Musical Director, is another matter.
Maazel's approach to Mozart and Mahler at least had the virtue of
consistency; both performances - of the E flat Symphony K549 and Mahler's
Sixth - were hard driven and glossy, self-consciously expressive,
interpretatively embalmed. If Mozart symphonies are still to be performed by
a modern symphony orchestra perhaps they should go all the way like this,
and be propelled by driving rhythms, shored up by heavily emphasised
dynamics and smothered under a thick blanket of string tone.
Certainly Maazel's Mozart seemed like an endangered species, unable or
unwilling to adapt to a changed concert environment, and his Mahler too
seemed to belong to a past age of over-interpretation, when Mahler's sense
of symphonic architecture could not be allowed to take of care itself but
had to be nudged and prodded along, with every passing event taken out of
its context and grotesquely magnified. The Pittsburgh played it with great
accuracy and tonal weight. It all made for an uncomfortable experience, not
because the nerve-ends of Mahler's emotional journey were revealed, far from
it, but because the parade of musical images was so coarse-grained, so
hopelessly over-blown.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Arts: Der fliegende Hollander - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On Monday a new Dutchman launched the 21st season of week-long Midland Bank
Proms at the Royal Opera House. It went off with a bang: a lively,
purposeful staging of an opera which, for all its sanctified position as the
first great Wagner music-drama, so often goes dull and purposeless in the
theatre. At Covent Garden the full resources of contemporary stage
technology are used to 'do the piece', not to re-invent it in the
high-concept terms that have become fashionable in recent years. (The 1986
Royal Opera production, with its factory sets and blue-jeaned Senta, was an
unloved and short-lived example of the latter trend.)
The producer and set-designer of this latest London Dutchman, Ian Judge and
John Gunter, have gone for spectacle which modernises the stagecraft of the
libretto while leaving its dramatic properties essentially unscathed. A
great pivoted wooden platform spins and dips and rears up to serve the
shipboard scene of the first part and the dockside of the last (the opera is
given in single-act form). Contrasts of local and supernatural, elemental
outdoors and cosy indoors, are neatly achieved with the raising and dropping
of sails and sea-front facades, the sharp-eyed detail of Deirdre Clancy's
costumes, the sudden blazing or dimming of lights.
The production looks at once complex and simple, spectacular and practical.
Big effects are swiftly and surely worked up. The drama whizzes along. Mr
Judge, director of (among many others) the celebrated ENO Faust, Opera North
Show Boat and Boris Godunov, and RSC Wizard of Oz and Comedy of Errors,
almost always comes up with a terrific show, and does so once more in his
first Covent Garden venture. My own feelings of deep disappointment at the
showbiz superficiality of it all  - the limited poetic horizons and stunted
humanity of the treatment, the patina of 'efficiency' that lies on the opera
like a thick cosmetic cover - will not be widely shared, will indeed appear
the grossest ingratitude.
One person on stage, however, wakens the performance to the high-Romantic
thrill to which it otherwise seems so strangely and resoundingly impervious.
This is Julia Varady, an artist in the full bloom of glorious maturity,
whose every note, every word, every action quickens with 'felt life', with
passionate spontaneity and musicianly and dramatic warmth. The very vibrancy
in the timbre removes this soprano from the realm of Northern-myth Sentas:
the sfumature of Miss Varady's singing, with its loving legato and
portamento phrasing, are generally thought of as belonging to the world of
Italian opera, though of course Wagner (himself a connoisseur of fine
Italianate singing) blossoms in such vocal conditions.
She is not a dramatic-soprano Senta, not limitless in stamina; while from
that small frame (set in particular relief by the presence of so many tall
male principals) some remarkable and fearless utterances are thrown out, the
climaxes of the duet with the Dutchman tax all her resources. Yet this too
humanises the portrayal, and with it the notion of redemptive
self-sacrifice, into something utterly fresh and vital - Miss Varady is
neither the icon-Senta of past Wagnerian treatment nor the nut-case-Senta of
recent years, but a flesh-and-blood creature upon whom the whole emotional
and poetic drama can properly be fastened.
Ideally, she needs to play opposite a Dutchman of similar vitality, similar
quickness of response. James Morris's Heldenbariton is well known in this
theatre; and though on Monday he started the evening in unwontedly dry,
hollow-voiced form, hooking and lifting up into the notes, the large sounds
and securely-shaped phrases soon came into focus. I feel about Mr Morris's
performance the same dastardly ingratitude as I do about the show as a
whole: admiration for his bigness and security of vocal craft, weariness at
the sheer predictability and externalised effects-making of his
characterisation.
The Swede Thomas Sunnegardh is a personable, slightly shallow-voiced Erik,
Neill Archer an alert and agreeably lyrical young Steersman (he also dances
notably well), Anne Wilkens a pleasantly tough, unfussy Mary. Gwynne
Howell's first Covent Garden Daland, though he too started the evening in
rough voice, is no cartoon capitalist but a rounded human being - Mr
Howell's gift for understated but sharply observed comedy, too little
employed, makes a welcome re-appearance.
The conductor is Christoph von Dohnanyi. Fine playing and singing from the
much-improved chorus, a forward-moving impulse to the solos and duets, a
clear and authoritative eye on the big climaxes, an exciting sweep to the
finale: the performance has all the now-familiar Dohnanyi virtues and many
others besides. What it lacks is genuine grandeur, ripe affection for the
picturesque musical elements (the sailor jollifications lose their rhythmic
bounce by being too evenly accented), richness and variety of atmosphere. In
a sense, conducting and production are all of a piece.

Channel 4's consumer affairs programme Check Out 92 (8.30) asks why there is
so little discussion of prostate cancer even though it kills 9,000 people a
year in Britain. The answer is obvious: the disease occurs exclusively in
men and anything exclusive to men is anathema to television. The medium is
obsessed by women's rights, beliefs, complaints, emotions and maladies.
'It's a man's world' chants the monstrous regiment and, after 13 years under
Mrs Thatcher and 40 under Elizabeth II, we dutifully nod our heads and
switch to the week's fourth programme on breast cancer and cervical smears.
It is a good night for those who like true stories about secret agents.
Timewatch (8.15 BBC2) tells of a Europe-wide terrorist network called
'Gladio'. Inside Story (9.30 BBC1) undertakes to reveal 'the story of
Russia's master spies' which until now have been 'shrouded in secrecy'.
Really?
Channel 4's new series of comedy pilot shows, Bunch Of Five (10.30), began
fairly well last week with a sort of 'Young Ones Plus'. This week Frank
Skinner is a would-be pop star living with his parents.

TOSG TRUST FUND LTD v GIROZENTRALE UND BANK DER OESTERREICHISCHEN SPARKASSEN
AKTIENGESELLSCHAFT AND OTHERS
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hobhouse: January 28
1992 BONDED SUMS obtained by an incorporated trust fund from banks on the
undertaking that money not used in exercise of its corporate powers will be
repaid, are repayable only to the extent that they exceed the aggregate of
the sums spent by the fund within its powers as set out in its memorandum
and articles of association.
Mr Justice Hobhouse so held when giving judgment for the plaintiff, TOSG
Trust Fund Ltd, on its claim against the defendant banks, Girozentrale und
Bank der Oesterreichischen Sparkassen Aktiengesellschaft and others, for a
declaration that it was not liable to repay to the banks bonded sums if,
though initially misapplied, they were subsequently properly applied by TOSG
in accordance with its powers.
HIS LORDSHIP said that TOSG was a company set up by the Tour Operators Study
Group, an association of UK travel and tour operators.
Its primary purpose was to administer bonding arrangements made for the
protection of its members' customers in the event of failure. Its objects
and powers were defined by its memorandum and articles of association.
In accordance with TOSG purposes a bond was issued by the banks on September
28 1989 in favour of TOSG. The subject matter of the bond was the potential
failure of a company called ILG Travel Ltd, a TOSG member.
The amount of the bond was Pounds 63.2m. The banks undertook to pay the
bonded sum to TOSG on demand in the event of ILG Travel's insolvency.
In consideration of issue of the bond, TOSG agreed to undertake to repay the
banks 'on demand' such part of the 'bonded sum' as was not spent by TOSG in
execution of its powers as set out in the memorandum and articles of
association. On March 8 1991 the appointment of administrators of ILG Travel
triggered the banks' obligation to pay under the bond. On March 11 Pounds
63m was paid by the banks to TOSG under the bond. On March 13 TOSG provided
the requisite letter of undertaking.
A problem then arose. The ILG group included other associated companies
which were not TOSG members. They were affected by the group's collapse.
Believing it was entitled to do so, TOSG made payments for the benefit of
the non-members' customers. The banks protested that those payments were not
within TOSG's powers. They claimed an injunction to restrain TOSG from
spending the bonded sum other than in connection with customers of ILG
Travel.
Judge Diamond sitting as a deputy High Court judge held that TOSG was
entitled to make payments in respect of non-members' customers. The banks
appealed. The Court of Appeal said TOSG was not entitled to make such
payments (FT, February 5 1992).
TOSG had paid Pounds 10m outside its powers (ultra vires) and, because the
banks were saying that sum should be repaid, it was left with only Pounds
40m to apply within its powers (intra vires) for customers of ILG Travel.
Since TOSG did not have funds apart from those paid under bonds, it was not
in a position to repay the banks save out of the funds received from the
banks.
A body called Air Travel Trust (ATT), established by the secretary of state
for transport to provide back-up to meet claims arising from the failure of
tour operators, had made loans to TOSG, and had given a conditional
undertaking which, subject to the present dispute, should also enable TOSG
to reinstate the sums expended ultra vires.
On February 11 1992 the banks formally demanded repayment of the Pounds 10m.
TOSG refused. On February 18 it issued the present proceedings raising the
question, inter alia, whether on the true construction of the undertaking it
was liable to repay sums applied ultra vires if reimbursed to TOSG (whether
by ATT or any other person) and then properly applied.
TOSG asked the court to declare it was not under any such liability. The
banks counterclaimed a declaration that it was. Their argument was that the
express words of the letter of undertaking required TOSG to repay the banks
on demand such part of the bonded sum as was not spent on intra vires
payments.
The figures to which the argument had to be applied were now reasonably
crystallised.
On the receipts side TOSG had had Pounds 63.2m under the bond on which it
had earned Pounds 3.94m interest, making a total Pounds 67.14m. From ATT it
had received Pounds 10.1m, partly by way of loan. On the payments side intra
vires payments totalling Pounds 51.4m had been made. Other payments totalled
Pounds 11.1m.
Accordingly at present TOSG had a reserve of Pounds 14.7m. It estimated that
there were about a further Pounds 16m intra vires claims to be met.
If TOSG was not required to repay the banks it would be able, with ATT's
assistance, to pay the ILG Travel customers' claims in full.
TOSG submitted that it should be allowed to make the intra vires payments in
full. The banks submitted that it should not, but should repay the Pounds
10m paid ultra vires prior to the provision of further funds by ATT.
The relationship between TOSG and the banks was simply one of debtor and
creditor.
The bond gave rise to an obligation on the banks' part to pay a sum to TOSG
on a certain contingency occurring. The letter of undertaking imposed on
TOSG an independent obligation to pay a sum to the banks on a certain
contingency. The contingency if it occurred created a liability in debt of
TOSG to the banks.
The question of construction of the letter of undertaking was one of
identifying the contingency on which creation of the debt stood.
The 'bonded sum' was an amount of money, not a fund in which the banks had
reserved any proprietary right or which was impressed with any trust.
Therefore one could substitute for 'bonded sum' the words Pounds 63.2m. If
TOSG could demonstrate it had spent Pounds 63.2m in performance and
execution of its intra vires function, it was not liable to repay anything
to the banks. The contingency had not occurred.
The Court of Appeal judgment was not concerned with the present questions.
It was asked to rule on a contention by TOSG that it could avoid liability
to repay by proving it would have been possible to have spent on intra vires
functions money which it had in fact spent on ultra vires functions. On that
argument it could not escape the express words of the undertaking. It could
not show that it had spent the money on intra vires functions. Rejection of
the contention was inevitable.
On the facts now before the court TOSG was in a position to show that,
subject to a small margin, the sum spent by TOSG on intra vires functions
would fully absorb the sum paid by the banks together with accrued interest.
When the matter was before the Court of Appeal TOSG was not in a position to
show that, and had to accept for the purposes of those proceedings that the
sums properly expended would inevitably fall short of the sum received by
some Pounds 10m.
The banks' present argument was that as soon as TOSG spent money ultra vires
an automatic liability accrued to make an equivalent payment to the banks.
That argument depended on some idea of an earmarked fund. There was not any
fund having that character.
In reality and in law the effect of the letter of undertaking was that when
TOSG came to state what it had spent, it could not bring into account any
ultra vires expenditure. It could only bring into account intra vires
expenditure that it had in fact made. Before the Court of Appeal TOSG's
arguments were bound to fail. Before the present court they succeeded.
On the true construction of the letter of undertaking TOSG was liable to
repay only the amount by which the bonded sum exceeded the aggregate of the
intra vires payments.
For TOSG: Alan Steinfield QC and Christopher Moger (Norton Rose).
For the banks: Jeremy Cooke QC and George Leggatt (Clifford Chance).

<TEXT>
David Lovett is quitting the US operations of Lafarge Coppee, the French
company which is the world's second largest cement manufacturer, to join one
of its arch rivals, Blue Circle of Britain.
As the new president and chief executive of Blue Circle's US operation,
Lovett, who is 50, replaces Keith Orrell-Jones. The latter will shortly be
returning to London as group managing director of Blue Circle Industries.
Blue Circle's US profits have slumped from Pounds 35.9m in 1987 to Pounds
11.5m last year, so Lovett will not be short of a challenge. It was poor
performance that prompted the arrival of Orrell-Jones two years ago; the
company credits him with introducing a stringent cost-cutting programme
which it claims has at least lessened the effects of deep recession.
A Canadian, Lovett has spent the last 23 years with Lafarge, mostly in
Canada. Three years ago he moved to Lafarge Corporation's headquarters in
Reston, Virginia, as president of the construction materials group, one of
the two principal divisions, reporting directly to Lafarge's boss, Robert
Murdoch.
Blue Circle and Lafarge and a small number of other European cement
companies have expanded aggressively into the US, and now account for around
half of America's cement production.
Blue Circle, whose ready-mix concrete and concrete product operations are
based mainly along the eastern seaboard, is headquartered in Atlanta,
Georgia.

FT  10 JUN 92 / People: Barclays Life reflects
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
On the principle that clearing bank managers and smooth-talking life
insurance salesmen never mix well, Barclays has decided to hire a thoughtful
consultant, Jeremy Goford, as managing director of its fast-growing Barclays
Life operation.
Goford, 46, has been poached from Tillinghast, one of the largest life and
general insurance consultancy firms in Europe, where he was vice president.
Having trained as an actuary with Equity and Law, he joined Mike Tuohy and
Chris Smart in 1973 to establish Tillinghast's London office. Apart from a
two-year stint as Skandia Life's finance director, Goford has spent the bulk
of his career with Tillinghast.
A member of the Council of The Institute of Actuaries, Goford's major
professional contribution is a paper on 'The Control Cycle - the financial
control of a life assurance company' which has become a reference document
for actuaries. He has spent a considerable amount of time measuring the
profitability of insurance products.
Barclays has been slower than some of its rivals, particularly Lloyds Bank,
to break into the lucrative life insurance market. Unlike Lloyds, which
acquired Abbey Life, Barclays decided to build its own life operation partly
because it felt that by growing its own operation there was less chance of
it alienating the managers of its 2,500 high street branches, its main sales
outlets.
'One of the fears of bank managers is what happens when a life insurance
salesman gets hold of their customers' says Goford. He intends to address
these fears by focusing more closely on what customers need rather than what
they can be sold. Given his experience as a consultant rather than a
salesman, he believes that he can make the job of marketing life insurance
'less intrusive'.
Last year, Barclays Life increased its sales by 18 per cent. With 1500
representatives in the field and assets of Pounds 1.5bn, it is already one
of the bigger insurance companies.
Goford is taking over from John Little, who has been doing the job on a
temporary basis and who will remain a director of Barclays Life.
*****
Sir John Banham, outgoing director general of the Confederation of British
Industry, is to become a non-executive director of National Westminster Bank
from July 1.
Sir John, who leaves the CBI at the end of this month, is to chair the
proposed new Local Government Commission. He will also take up non-executive
directorships at National Power and Tarmac from the beginning of July.
In 1983, Sir John was appointed Controller of the Audit Commission and
became director general of the CBI in 1987.
*****
Ray Pettitt, 55, who is retiring after ten very active years at the helm of
Minet, the international insurance broker, may firmly dismiss any future
role at the troubled Lloyd's insurance market.
But he could be a useful man to have around at Lime Street as the market's
bosses grapple with rebel Names. Minet Holdings became ensnared by scandal
in the early 1980s, when executives from the group's then subsidiary, the
PCW managing agency, were accused of siphoning off cash belonging to Lloyd's
Names. Pettitt, who had spent much of his working life in Nairobi building
up Minet's African subsidiaries, was drafted in to clean up the mess.
And he has also had some corporate finance experience - which could come in
handy for a market seeking to attract 'corporate capital'. In 1988 he was
involved in negotiations which ended in the sale of Minet to its current
owners, The St Paul Companies, a Minnesota-based insurance company - the
first time any Lloyd's broker has been sold to an insurance company.
Minet is looking to the younger generation for a replacement. Peter
Christie, 45, is a specialist in liability insurance. Christie has been with
Minet since 1968. He was appointed group managing director and chief
operating officer in June last year. Pettitt will continue in his role of
non-executive chairman until the end of October.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Management: How to stay in control when your staff is
revolting - Lucy Kellaway offers managers a practical guide to coping with
difficult colleagues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How many difficult people do you have to deal with at work? There is the one
who moans incessantly; the paranoid one who will not stop talking; and one
who cannot take decisions. There is a prima-donna, a bully and the nervous
one who clicks his finger-joints. If only we could find a way of coping with
these people, our working lives would be a lot easier.
According to Barry Woolf, an expert in anti-social behaviour at work, the
first mistake is to confuse difficult people with difficult behaviour.
Genuinely difficult people are apparently rare, while nearly everyone is
capable of behaving in a difficult way.
Quoting recent US research, he says that only 6 per cent of people suffer
from the 'real jerk syndrome'. The other 94 per cent 'just want to get
along'. Treated properly, they should pose no problems.
The whole question is subjective, Woolf told a packed conference organised
by IIR Seminar Centre. Everyone is likely to object to behaviour that is the
opposite of their own. If you are very efficient, it may be hard to work
with someone who is in a permanent muddle and cannot get anything done. They
may find your neat lists and schedules equally maddening.
The aim, says Woolf (whose modulated voice and unruffleable behaviour might
annoy some people), is not to change the 'difficult people', but to change
the way they behave towards us and the way we respond to them. We must be
more flexible and more tolerant. We must understand and be able to predict
the sort of things that are likely to get on our nerves.
The idea is to defuse conflict before it arises. Woolf suggests 'pacing' the
difficult person, which means copying their body language and even breathing
at the same rate, to create the impression of harmony and agreement.
However, there is a danger that your colleague may notice you are breathing
in an unnatural way and scratching you head each time they scratch theirs:
that would surely spoil everything.
In most situations, it is going to take more than rhythmic breathing to sort
out the problem. Never mind talk about subjectivity, many sorts of behaviour
are plain difficult, whichever way you look at it. Some of the most common
are:
Exploders, who blow up over trivial details.
Wet blankets, who contribute nothing, then say: 'I told you so'.
Moaners who complain constantly.
Gossip-mongers who spread rumours.
Backsliders who always say that it's not their fault.
Stubborn people who will only do things their way.
What makes this sort of behaviour difficult is that it provokes a response
in you: you snap back in anger, work yourself up into a private rage, or say
something you regret later. The ideal is to recognise the hook and refuse to
respond. Say to yourself: 'I am not going to let this get on my nerves'.
But sometimes, the behaviour is so obstreperous that something needs to be
done. A talk may be a good idea, but according to Woolf, this needs to be
handled with great care. He suggests you should:
Listen to what is being said.
Humour colleagues. Acknowledge what they have to say.
Replay the offending event or behaviour to them.
Tell them what you feel about it, and note the unfortunate consequences of
their behaviour. Explain the changes in a firm, non-challenging way,
offering as carrots any positive benefits to the organisation.
Woolf's advice may be good, although it rather assumes that the person is
already pretty reasonable. Really difficult people are likely to go into
orbit if they suspect you are humouring them. Behaving like a saint may help
in some cases. Of more practical assistance are his crisis measures to deal
with particularly nasty behaviour.
BULLIES
Let colleagues vent their anger, but try not to take it personally. Separate
the emotion from what they are trying to say.
Stand up for yourself: explain the benefits of your point of view, and
express your disagreement in factual terms. Above all, make sure you have
your facts right.
Allow them to save face.
If all this fails, get help.
BLAMERS AND MOANERS
If someone is seeking to avoid blame, you should:
Make sure that the facts are in the open and point them out.
Don't sympathise and, above all, if they are trying to blame you, don't rise
to it.
If colleagues complain constantly, you should:
Make a list of the complaints, and present it to them.
Discuss the matter with them surrounded by positive people.
Ask: 'What are you going to do to fix the problem?'
PROCRASTINATORS
Set a system or diary, and make sure they know what they are supposed to be
doing and by when.
Be supportive of their efforts.
Follow up, keeping close tabs.
These stereotypes may be of no help with your difficult people. In general,
Woolf recommends a six-step written Master Plan that will deal with
everyone.
It involves writing down:
Details of your difficult people and their particularly annoying
characteristics.
Why you are vulnerable to them.
What specifically the person does to trap you
Your typical response.
A plan to deal with the problem, and a list of expected advantages.
Later, monitor your progress.
If you can make this list without getting into a fury at the very thought of
your difficult person, you may be on the way to cracking the problem.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Management: Top bosses find change is as good as a pest -
Senior executives are becoming resistant to altering the way they work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Resistance from middle managers is usually considered the biggest obstacle
to the sort of organisational and culture change which most western
companies are trying to implement. Yet in Britain, resistance to change
among senior executives is soaring to such an extent that top managers now
claim it is becoming almost as serious a barrier.
Not only that, but top managers say that resistance from their own board
colleagues, albeit less intense than from middle or senior managers, has
become a greater problem than opposition from junior managers or even from
trade unions. Some organisations are now suffering from a 'siege' mentality
among their managers.
These are the findings of a survey about Managing Change in the 1990s* among
475 top and senior executives in 364 large British organisations, in both
the private and public sectors.
As the second survey of its kind in two years by the same consultancy,
People In Business, the results provide a useful gauge of the changing
temperature at various organisational levels.
The survey is not an objective test, since it measures the perceptions of
top managers - 91 per cent of the sample were directors. But it does shed
light on how managerial attitudes tend to shift, both as change programmes
get under way for the first time - as in many public sector organisations at
present - and as executives start to be more affected by established change
programmes than they had expected.
The study does not demonstrate conclusively whether changes in resistance
are associated directly with job insecurity, but its authors say that part
of the increased resistance is from managers whose departments are under
threat.
In terms of strict ranking, resistance from middle managers is still seen as
Obstacle No 1 by the survey's respondents: it was cited by 22 per cent, the
same as in 1990.
This constitutes a serious problem. As the study says, recalcitrant middle
managers act as a 'refractive layer', 'blocking, distorting or bending
communication about change'. Instead of being labelled by their
organisations as 'villains', these managers need to be integrated with the
change process and made comfortable with it, the study argues. They must be
'given' the skills to handle their new roles as change leaders, rather than
being left to flounder.
If this is true of middle managers, it applies even more to the executives
above them. Yet the new survey suggests that such managers are themselves
fast becoming 'a second refractive layer'. It ranks resistance from senior
managers (one or two levels below the board) as Obstacle No 2; opposition
from them was cited by 18 per cent of respondents, up from only 12 per cent
in 1990. Resistance from top management, at 11 per cent (up from 8 per cent)
has overtaken resistance from trade unions, at 10 per cent (down from 12 per
cent). Perceived resistance from junior managers is up slightly,from 6 to 8
per cent, while opposition from lower-ranked staff employees is down from 9
to 7 per cent.
When the responses are broken down between the private and public sectors,
the implications of the survey become even more intriguing. The perceived
surge in resistance among senior managers stemmed entirely from the private
sector (where it was cited by 20 per cent of respondents, up from 13 per
cent in 1990), with the public sector perception of it stable at 8 per cent.
Yet the surge in reported 'top' management resistance was entirely in the
public sector (up from nil to 11 per cent), with private sector perception
of it stable at the previous survey's level of 11 per cent.
Paul Lloyd, one of the study's authors, says the odd-looking public sector
figures may be explicable in terms of time lapse. Most public sector
organisations are at an earlier stage in the management change process than
the private sector, he says. As a result, top management resistance is only
now catching up with private sector levels. As for the relative lack of
resistance below board level, Lloyd suggest that this is either because
change has not yet become an issue between top managers and those
immediately beneath them, or because there is a greater sense of fear in the
public sector, so that senior managers 'will jump when told to'.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Hoisting a new green standard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies in search of a green badge of approval might be tempted to conform
to the rigours of the new environmental management standard from the British
Standards Institution (BSI).
Compliance with the standard, known as BS7750, will indeed signal some form
of environmental credibility but, more importantly, it promises to transport
companies down a route which could have striking effects on the corporate
culture.
'Don't do it for publicity,' warns Michael Gilbert, the project manager of
the BSI's environment initiative. 'Using 7750 is like total quality
management - you can't go at it half-heartedly. It's about cultural change
and if you're not willing to bite the bullet, then forget it.'
BS7750 describes the type of management systems and procedures that have to
be in place for companies to produce a sound environmental performance. A
small number of pioneering companies, such as BP, have been doing this
privately for some time.
The standard was launched in April and is now being tested by 50 companies.
It will not become a formal standard for at least a year. The BSI wants it
to be consistent with a number of other emerging standards, such as the EC's
Eco-Audit regulation and its eco-labelling scheme.
It looks likely that 7750 will be the backbone on which the International
Organisation for Standardisation (ISO) builds its environmental management
standard. The BSI is contributing to a draft international standard
scheduled for completion in September.
BS7750 establishes an institutionalised system which can be verified by
outsiders, in the same way as the closely related quality management
standard, known as BS5750.
The BSI's environmental management standard is significant on both a
practical and political level. Its uptake will, for example, indicate just
how keen business is to regulate itself.
Business leaders, such as those on the Business Council for Sustainable
Development and the UK's Advisory Committee on Business and Environment,
have been arguing strongly for the benefits of self-regulation rather than
imposed legislation.
Compliance would also send important signals to the market. An increasing
number of customers are demanding high environmental performance from their
suppliers. Conformance with a recognised environmental management standard,
such as 5750, could become a minimum requirement in contracts.
'A lot of companies went for the quality management standard (5750) to get a
badge on the wall to satisfy customers. In some sectors, especially waste
management, the same will apply to 7750,' says Tony Bishop, manager of
environmental services at PA Consulting.
The environment standard has been written to appeal to almost any business
in any sector. 'The oil industry has had a positive experience with 5750 and
we are hoping for the same with 7750,' says Mike Northover, a member of the
health, safety and environment management group at the UK Petroleum Industry
Association.
'I don't think it is the commercial side that our industry is interested in.
We are trying to improve our operations rather than trying to show that we
are more green. But I don't think that any of us will decide to go for it
gung-ho until we find out how practical it is,' he says.
Ray Nash, development manager at Beaman Bodyworks Barnstaple, a small Devon
company that repairs damaged cars, says compliance with the standard will be
good for the company's efficiency and marketing.
Beaman was the first business in its sector to comply with 5750. It is keen
to conform to 7750 too, although it has decided against being part of the
initial pilots.
'One thinks that these standards will cause a lot of hassle but it's not
like that at all. We have become more efficient and it takes one person five
to 10 hours a week to manage 5750. But I must say that if we had not managed
to implement 5750 I don't think we would have even begun to understand
7750,' says Nash.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Jobs: Spanish ensconced on high - Smaller companies'
executive-pay league
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT has 10 years of socialist government in Spain done to the country's top
managers? Ensconced them on the heights of the European executive-pay
league, that's what. Their prominence now stands confirmed by four
successive salary studies from two different sources.
The latest, just published, is by the European Remuneration Network, a
consortium of nine consultancies and institutes, each doing separate pay
surveys. Their combined exercise for 1992 covers 3,309 companies employing
nearly 40,000 executives of various ranks in 11 countries. But anybody
wanting data on all of them will need the full report (priced at Pounds 525
including postage and an up-date in the winter), obtainable from the
network's British member: P-E International, Park House, Wick Rd, Egham,
Surrey TW20 0HW; telephone 0784 434411, fax 0784 437828.
My extracts, in the table to the right, are limited to eight of the
countries, and to companies in two particular size-bands as measured by
total numbers of employees. The first are those with up to 100 on the
payroll, the second are those with between 250 and 1,000. While the separate
surveys were made at different dates, their findings have all been up-dated
in line with higher-level pay movements to the start of this month. I have
converted the other currencies to sterling at the London market's closing
rates on June 4.
For each country and size-band, the table begins with managing directors.
Then come heads of marketing-and-sales and of finance, together with heads
of personnel except in the small companies of the United Kingdom, Belgium
and the Netherlands, where not enough of same were employed to furnish
statistically respectable data.
In every case the table shows both basic salary and total pay received in
money including bonuses and suchlike. The lower quartile figures in light
type relate to the executive who would be a quarter of the way up from the
foot of a ranking of all in the same country and type of job. The upper
quartiles, again in light type, refer to the one a quarter way down from the
top.
The median figures in bold type give not only the salary and total cash pay
of the executive mid-way in the ranking, but also a rough indication of
buying power. It is calculated by taking the total pay, deducting the
country's standard tax and so on for someone married with two dependent
children, then adjusting the result in line with P-E's index of
international differences in the costs of executive life. But please be
warned that - although I've ranked the countries on the buying power of the
M D of the bigger-sized companies - such living-cost comparisons are
extremely sketchy. For one thing, they take no account of housing. For
another, indices produced by different organisations can vary widely.
Even on straightforward exchange-rate conversions, however, the Spanish
managing directors of the 250-1,000 employee companies tower above all the
rest (and in the up-to-100 bracket come second only to their counterparts in
France). Spain's M Ds also have a bigger differential over their subordinate
departmental heads than is generally the case elsewhere.
As for the UK, it appears to be ex-ceptional along with Denmark in the
valuation it places on heads of sales and marketing by comparison with heads
of finance. In both countries those two departmental bosses have much the
same median total pay. But everywhere else the sales and marketing head is
several percentage points better off.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Heseltine pledge on coal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, guaranteed yesterday
that British Coal employees will get a stake in its future, whatever form of
privatisation is chosen.
Addressing the annual conference of the Union of Democratic Mineworkers
(UDM), he said that no final decision had yet been taken on how to privatise
British Coal but expressed sympathy for the UDM-led consortium which aims to
take a 25 per cent stake in the corporation.
Mr Roy Lynk, president of the UDM, said he would approach British Coal board
members to join the consortium as well as the main management unions. The
open-cast mining company R. J. Budge Mining of Retford, which employs about
1,000 people, has already joined.
Privately, UDM officials have made clear that they would welcome the
participation of Mr Albert Wheeler, deputy chairman of British Coal, but do
not want Mr Neil Clarke, the chairman, or Mr Ken Moses, the other deputy
chairman. Mr Clarke was criticised by some delegates for not standing up
strongly enough for the coal industry.
A buy-out led by the UDM, the union that broke away from the National Union
of Mineworkers during the 1984-85 miners' strike, would be politically
attractive for the government, but is not possible without a secure
agreement for supplying coal to the privatised electricity industry.
Mr Heseltine said he could not dictate to privatised companies but did say
to the electricity generators: 'Remember when you are negotiating these
contracts that you are determining the future availability of a national
resource for which you will have longer-term need. Remember also that you
are talking about communities of men and women whose lives will be affected
by your decisions.'
Mr Heseltine warned that even with an agreement, the number of pits would
fall from the present total of 50 after privatisation, but he said the
industry should still be able to win the 'lion's share of the domestic
market'.
He also tried to reassure the UDM that privatisation would involve no
compromises over health and safety, pensions, or concessionary coal. Mr Lynk
said he welcomed Mr Heseltine's speech, which amounted to a 'green light'
for the UDM-led bid.
The consortium of mineworkers that took over the Monktonhall colliery
outside Edinburgh from British Coal yesterday has no sources of finance
apart from the money the miners invest themselves, it emerged yesterday,
James Buxton writes.
Each of the 200-odd members of the consortium is investing Pounds 10,000,
making about Pounds 2m.
Monktonhall Mineworkers, the company created to run the mine, the first deep
mine to be operated by the private sector since 1947, has been granted a
lease and licence to operate Monktonhall by British Coal, which mothballed
it in 1987. It expects to commence production within six months.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Manchester to seek Olympics contracts bids
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER is to invite consortia to bid for contracts to design, build,
operate and maintain the stadium, cycle track and other sporting facilities
for its bid for the 2000 Olympics.
The combined-contract approach - DBOM for short - was used for the city's
Metrolink supertram. Designers and builders receive the bulk of their
returns from running the facilities over several years, rather than simply
taking profits from construction.
Mr John Redwood, the environment minister, opened the bidding for the
Olympic facilities to worldwide competition yesterday. Only well financed
consortia of architects, civil engineering contractors, development
companies and leisure management specialists are likely to have much chance.
Several large contractors have already made inquiries and are assembling
consortia.
Mr Robert Lewin of Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank advising the
Manchester team, said consortia should declare themselves by July 27. A
shortlist of three or four will be asked to go into more detail by November
2, with selection of the preferred consortium in January.
The aim is to negotiate a contract by this time next year, with construction
starting three months later - at about the time the International Olympic
Committee is choosing between Manchester, Berlin, Milan, Brasilia, Beijing
and Sydney.
For the supertram, rival consortia had to prove they could underwrite the
Pounds 135m project. However, for the Olympics contracts, experience of
successful syndicated fund-raising from financial institutions to pay for
big projects will be enough.
The Olympic Village, a housing project, is not included, but as much as half
the Pounds 1bn cost of the games is likely to be involved.
The government has committed Pounds 55m to preparing the ground and the bid.
Total public-sector commitment is likely to be nearly Pounds 300m if
Manchester wins the games.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Sins of commission exact a price: A long dispute over
payments to intermediaries in the financial services industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'sins of commission' came back to haunt the UK's financial services
industry yesterday.
Two reports issued yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading conclude that
consumers know too little about the financial products they buy to choose
them wisely and that commissions paid to sales agents distort those choices.
Most financial intermediaries are paid by commission for each sale they
make. The level of commission varies substantially between products and
between companies.
This report revives a long-running dispute within the industry and raises
the question of whether self-regulation is workable for the industry.
Regulation has been controversial ever since the Financial Services Act
(FSA) became law in 1988, but the publication at the end of last month of
the conclusions of the Securities and Investments Board's 13-month retail
investment review was supposed to put the issue to rest.
The OFT's reports attack SIB's conclusions on commission disclosure -
forcing intermediaries to disclose what they have been paid by product
providers - but they also throw into question the scope of the entire
regulatory regime.
Mr Jeremy Mitchell, a former director of the National Consumer Council and
director of consumer affairs at the OFT, and Ms Helena Wiesner, a director
of Lautro, the Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory Office, produced
independent reports.
They agreed on several points.
Levels of commission may influence the advice of salesmen. That is
illustrated by growth in the sale of endowment mortgages, which pay a
commission not available for standard repayment mortgages. In 1970,
endowments accounted for 6.7 per cent of mortgages and repayments for 88 per
cent. In 1990, endowments took 75 per cent of mortgages and repayments only
20 per cent.
Endowments are less flexible and often more expensive than their repayment
counterparts, according to Ms Wiener, who believes the high rate of
surrender of such policies gives 'considerable grounds for concern'.
The drive by life companies to secure sales outlets, particularly with
building societies, has pushed up commission levels. 'Tied agency' deals, in
which a building society sells only the products of one life office, have
proved very popular, and only two large building societies, Bradford &amp;
Bingley and Yorkshire, remain independent.
According to Ms Wiesner's report, Halifax building society, which is tied to
Standard Life, the UK's largest mutual life insurer, received Pounds 162m in
commission during 1990 - 16 per cent of income and 27 per cent of profits.
Since 1989, the share taken by commission from a 10-year endowment policy
has risen by 27 per cent for independents and 47 per cent for tied agents.
According to Lautro's last commission survey, the highest commission paid on
a Pounds 50-a-month, 25-year endowment policy at a tied agent was Pounds 642
 -more than the whole first year's premiums.
High turnover of sales staff may have implications for their training and
competence. On average, 38 per cent of new sales recruits to life insurance
companies leave within a year and 54 per cent leave within two. One office,
Provident Mutual, loses 90 per cent of recruits within two years.
Ms Wiesner says a company representative leaving a company may encourage
people he or she has advised to surrender their policies and invest with a
new company.
SIB decided not to force intermediaries to disclose their commissions
because direct sales forces and tied agents could not be made to do the
same.
That would put independents at a disadvantage as SIB forces independents to
disclose their commissions, if asked, once a sale has been completed.
Ms Wiesner rejects that argument, saying independent advice is worth paying
for, and that consumers should know the true price.
The OFT reports agree with SIB in one area. Sir David Walker, outgoing
chairman of SIB, called the scope of regulation under the FSA into question.
He pointed out that insurance products come under one regime, but building
society accounts, which most consumers regard as closely comparable, are
regulated by another - the Building Societies Commission.
Mr Mitchell pointed to the levels of compensation a consumer could expect
for different investments.
An investor claiming compensation on an investment of Pounds 60,000 could
expect a maximum of Pounds 60,000 if the investment were covered by the Law
Society or the Policyholders' Protection Act, but only Pounds 18,000 for a
building society deposit, and Pounds 15,000 for a bank deposit.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Future looks up for Scots engineers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGINEERING companies in Scotland reported a modest rise in optimism
yesterday. Intake of orders and capital investment had increased, with the
electronics industry and medium-sized engineering companies reporting growth
while heavy engineering had a drop in orders.
Scottish Engineering, which published its quarterly survey for the three
months to June of its 300 members as well as some electronics companies that
are not members, said the survey showed a 'positive move out of the depths
of recession across the industry'.
The level of job losses was slowing down, the survey said.
The proportion of companies reporting increased optimism about their
prospects was 41 per cent, compared with 32 per cent in the previous survey,
which covered the period to the end of February.
The proportion saying their optimism was unchanged was static at 44 per
cent.
In the electronics sector, some 42 per cent of companies said their orders
had increased, while 28 per cent said they had declined.
In heavy engineering, though, more companies reported a fall in orders than
reported an increase.
The foundry sector appeared to have arrested its orders decline, but
improvement was patchy.
Only light engineering companies said they had increased their staffing
level, while other parts of the industry were still shedding labour.
Overtime worked was falling, with the heavy engineering sector showing the
sharpest fall.
On capital investment, 18 per cent of companies said they were increasing
their spending while 19 per cent said they were reducing it. The rest
reported no change. The electronics sector reported the biggest increase in
investment in training.

FT  10 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: Call for stronger action on forest
destruction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Members of Europe's leading non-governmental organisations (NGOs) last night
met European environment ministers at the summit to call for stronger action
on forest destruction and a commitment to work towards a worldwide forest
convention, reports Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro.
Forests, are one of the most contentious issues of the summit, and there has
been little progress on bridging the north-south divide on the subject. With
only one day of working group discussions left it seems unlikely there will
be any agreement on deforestation which is continuing at a rate of 17m
hectares a year.
Mr Andrew Lees from Friends of the Earth said there was a danger the summit
was losing sight of vital environmental problems because so much was being
negotiated simultaneously in Rio. Forest devastation was continuing
'unhindered' in the meantime.
A convention had to be dropped long before the summit and replaced by a
non-binding declaration of forest principles which says little other than
that forests should be conserved and managed sustainably. Even this is
causing controversy at the conference with developing countries, led by
Malaysia, seeing it as an infringement of their sovereignty.
NGOs argue that the declaration is so weak as to be almost worthless
particularly as it includes no firm commitment to halt deforestation. The
NGO demands presented to ministers last night include a commitment to follow
up the principles with a legally binding instrument, and to allow
signatories to set up national policies against trade in unsustainable
forest products.

FT  10 JUN 92 / The Earth Summit: British business left in the cold - Diary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH businessmen hoping to promote their wares at the Earth Summit in Rio
de Janeiro are grumbling about lack of support from the UK government. A
band of exporters have put up their stalls 300 miles from Rio in Sao Paulo,
Brazil's commercial capital, which is staging an exhibition of environmental
technology.
Talk that Mr John Major, the British premier, might pop in has fallen
through. Downing Street thought he should spend time on the way to Brazil
talking to Colombians about drug control; Mr Michael Howard, the environment
secretary, would go to Sao Paulo instead. Now he has cancelled as well,
because of negotiations in Rio.
So Britain's gallant few had to do with Mr David Maclean, the environment
minister, who slipped into Sao Paulo for a few hours on his way home to
London yesterday. The Germans, by contrast, will be visited today by
Chancellor Helmut Kohl. 'Typical,' mutters a disgusted Brit.
*****
Everyone is relying on Japan to provide the money and technology to
implement the summit treaties. But it is the great polluters, the Chinese,
that are bringing a smile to the faces of delegates.
Chen Wen Yii, an enterprising Chinese immigrant, has set up a flower shop
inside the conference centre from which he is distributing red roses free.
'For people to save the planet it is important that they are happy,' he
explains.
*****
Mr John Major will be met by a sleek green Jaguar when he arrives in Rio
tonight. He may never know how close he was to hitching a lift.
Brazil, still one of the world's most protected economies, only recently
allowed the importation of cars, and no suitable British vehicle was
available in the country. The closest armour-plated car was in Georgetown,
British Guyana, and had to be shipped down the coast, suffering considerable
damage en route.
Until a few days ago the Jaguar was in pieces in a mechanic's shop in Rio
waiting for new parts - including a bullet-proof windscreen - to be flown
in. Mr Brian Brown, the mechanic and a British former naval engineer, had to
postpone leaving Brazil to finish the task.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Congress tries to kick deficit habit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONGRESS will today begin debate on a last bulwark against the
ever-spiralling US fiscal deficit: an amendment to the constitution to
require the president and Congress to balance the budget.
Neither Republican President George Bush nor the Democratic majority in
Congress has shown much appetite for taking the tough decisions necessary to
comply with such a constitutional amendment, such as raising taxes or
slashing spending.
Nevertheless, both Mr Bush and an improbable coalition of Democrats such as
Senator Paul Simon of Illinois and Representative Charles Stenholm of Texas
have joined forces to press for the amendment.
The balanced budget amendment has lost momentum in recent weeks as it
encountered stubborn opposition from senior Democrats, led by Senator Robert
Byrd of West Virginia.
Still, the measure has kept up a good head of steam and is thought to stand
a fair chance of winning the required two-thirds majority in a House of
Representatives vote expected tomorrow, even if it then faces a rougher ride
in the Senate.
Senator Byrd likens the amendment to everybody's favourite granny: cute, but
toothless. 'You cannot gum the deficit to death,' he told his colleagues.
If passed by the necessary majority in both houses, the amendment would need
to be ratified by three-quarters of the US's 50 states to take effect.
The campaign for a balanced budget amendment has won much of its support,
particularly in the House, from legislators anxious to redeem themselves
with voters who have expressed increasing disgust at Washington's apparent
gridlock, as well as at members' exploitation of the liberal overdraft
policies of their House bank.
But its backers have also tapped a national undercurrent of concern at the
mounting national debt, which has quadrupled to more than Dollars 4bn
(Pounds 2.1bn) in the last decade.
The drive for a balanced budget amendment mirrors in some respects the
appeal of Mr Ross Perot, the Texas billionaire who has built his still
undeclared presidential campaign heavily on the need to tackle the deficit,
and on Washington's inability to get the job done.
The budget deficit this year is expected to set a new record at Dollars
400bn, or nearly 6.9 per cent of gross domestic product. Although this
deficit would, on the administration's projections, fall in the mid-1990s as
the cost of bank failures dwindles, it would start to rise again in 1997,
both in cash terms and as a proportion of GDP.
Net interest this year is estimated by the Congressional Budget Office at
Dollars 201bn, more than 18 per cent of total tax revenue.
Last week, Mr Bush threw his weight behind the amendment in a news
conference. But he and the amendment's congressional backers look rather
like alcoholics begging their friends to take away the whisky bottle, while
simultaneously trying to hold on to their jobs as barmen.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VENEZUELA says it intends to seek new financing terms for about Dollars 769m
(Pounds 422.5m) of external government debt not included in a general debt
restructuring agreement signed in 1990, but is not seeking to renegotiate
the accord.
This week's announcement by Mr Pedro Rosas, finance minister, came after
Venezuelan newspapers quoted a congressman and other figures as saying that
the government should consider renegotiating its Dollars 19.8bn of
restructured debt. Mr Rosas denied that the government intended to
renegotiate the debt rescheduled in the 1990 Brady accord, which con-sists
principally of marketable bonds.
The government, facing a large fiscal deficit this year, plans to reschedule
about 50bn bolivars (Dollars 769m at the current exchange rate) in
non-restructured foreign government debt, scheduled to mature this year and
next year. The debt comprised mostly supplier credits and commercial paper
to finance military purchases, Mr Rosas said. Some internal government debt
will also be refinanced.
The minister added that interest payments were being made 'normally' on both
restructured and non-restructured debt.
The government of President Carlos Andres Perez, immersed in a political
crisis since a coup attempt in February, is struggling to cover a large
fiscal deficit caused mainly by weak prices for its main export, petroleum.
The government, however, still has a strong reserve position. International
monetary reserves in mid-May stood at more than Dollars 13bn, about the same
as at the end of 1991.
According to official figures, Venezuela's total external public debt stood
at Dollars 26.8bn at end-1991, up slightly on the year. Interest and
principal payments on external debt last year totalled about Dollars 2.2bn.
The government also allotted Dollars 646.5m to debt repurchases and Dollars
329.8m for debt-equity swaps in 1991.

PAPUA NEW Guinea yesterday claimed to have re-established central government
control in 80 per cent of the secessionist island of Bougainville, which has
been in rebel hands since police and army units withdrew in 1990, writes
Kevin Brown in Sydney.
Mr Rabbie Namaliu, the prime minister, said the government expected to
regain control of the remaining rebel areas in the Kieta and Arawa districts
by the end of the year.
Military beachheads have been established recently on Buka Island, to the
north of Bougainville, and at Siwai, in the south. However, Mr Namaliu said
the re-establishment of government control in the remaining rebel-held areas
would be achieved 'by talking, not with the barrel of a gun.'
He said Mr Francis Ona, leader of the rebel Bougainville Revolutionary Army,
had requested a resumption of peace talks, which have been held
intermittently over the past two years.
'I have said we are prepared to resume on the condition that secession is
not included for discussion,' Mr Namaliu said.

INDONESIA'S President Suharto (above left) watches people queueing to vote
yesterday in an election which his ruling Golkar party expects to be
returned to power with a substantial majority, William Keeling reports from
Jakarta.
Early reports suggested a high turnout of about 90 per cent, with
preliminary results expected later today. There has been little violence.
Gen Try Sutrisno, the chief of armed forces, warned on Monday of
'individuals and parties who want to turn back the clock' by preaching a
Marxist ideology. About 500,000 people died in a bloody backlash following a
failed communist coup d'etat in 1965.
Gen Sutrisno denied that there would be manipulation in counting the vote,
although government officials have conceded an element of fraud in past
elections.
In the last election in 1987, the Golkar party won 73 per cent of the vote.
Opposition parties were expected to make only marginal gains yesterday.
Despite the overwhelming support for Golkar, some voters in Jakarta
yesterday spoke of disillusion with the political process.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Islamic murder awakes fears among Egyptian elite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER and SHAHIRA IDRIS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   CAIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EGYPT'S liberal elite has been stunned by the Moslem extremist assassination
on Monday in Cairo of Dr Farag Foda, the prominent secularist writer and
campaigner against fundamentalism.
Dr Foda was caught in a hail of bullets fired from an automatic rifle as he
left his office in a Cairo suburb. He died later in hospital. One of his
assailants was arrested.
Mohammed Sayed Ahmed, a columnist for the daily Al Ahram, described the
killing as 'an extremely serious development'.
He said that the threat of Moslem extremism in the country was increasing
'exponentially'.
Dr Foda's assassination coincides with a government crackdown on Islamic
extremists, and follows serious communal disturbances recently in towns
south of Cairo between Moslems and Christians, in which 13 people were
killed.
It also comes on the eve of another IMF-inspired round of price increases
that are certain to fuel resentment among hard-pressed Egyptians as the long
hot summer approaches.
Ms Hala Mustapha, an expert on Islam at the Al Ahram Strategic Studies
centre, described Dr Foda's slaying as 'a terrible thing'. An Egyptian had
now been murdered for his 'opinions'.
'This is a dangerous tendency because one used to say that those groups were
in conflict with the government,' she observed. 'But now it is not so: they
are targeting any kind of view which is contrary to theirs.'
'This is without any doubt terrorism, an unprecedented incident that could
threaten the whole society,' she added. 'This man could do nothing; he had
no power, he was not a politician. All he had was his pen. . . .''
The assassination in broad daylight of Dr Foda by young men claiming
membership of Islamic Jihad (the same group responsible for the murder in
1981 of President Anwar Sadat) is almost certain to force the Egyptian
authorities into a further review of their strategy in dealing with Moslem
extremism.
The government has been seeking to co-opt mainstream Islamic groups by
presenting itself as a custodian of Islamic values, while at the same time
cracking down hard on fringe Islamic groups such as the Jihad which advocate
violence.
The banned but tolerated Moslem Brotherhood (Ikhwan) may also find itself
under increased official pressure following the death of Dr Foda and
indications recently that Islamic extremism is again on the rise in Egypt.
Mr Maamoun Hodeibi, the leader of the Ikhwan in Egypt's parliament, said
yesterday his organisation 'regretted' the incident, but blamed the
government for allowing the public media to be used to attack Islam.
'The position of the government in general and that of the government-run
media in particular is responsible for such an incident,' he declared. 'The
government-run media has its writers who attack Islam. . . '
Dr Foda, 47, was easily the most prominent among Egyptian critics of Islamic
extremism, and last week advocated the enactment of a special law to deal
with terrorism.
An unsuccessful candidate for Egypt's 1990 parliamentary elections, he
declared in a campaign statement: 'I'm fighting terrorism. I'm not fighting
the people who pray, but I'm fighting the people who abandoned dialogue and
who fight now with the Kalashnikov.'

FT  10 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Tokyo hits back at Washington the 'unfair
trader' - Japan finds condemnation can create a useful stir among its
trading partners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT LEAST one senior Japanese official welcomed Washington's anger at topping
a new Japanese league table of unfair traders. The US scored more violations
than Indonesia and Malaysia, two countries not generally cited as models of
free trade.
Having felt neglected by the international community, Tokyo has concluded
that condemnation can create a useful stir among its trading partners,
particularly the European Community and US.
The release this week of a controversial report on Unfair Trade Policies
should be taken as a promise of condemnation to come. The report, authorised
by Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), found that
the US had abuses or misuses in nine of 10 trade categories surveyed. It was
blasted by the Bush administration on the 'people who live in glass houses'
principle and by US Congressman Richard Gephardt, who suggested that 'Japan
doesn't have the credibility to call others unfair'.
Conceding that Japan is deficient in various trade areas, indeed, that the
country is a 'sinner', the government report, to be prepared annually, is
intended to point the finger at Japan's major trading partners.
In the past, a passive Japan hinted it would appeal to the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) for a ruling on unilateral action taken against
it by the US and EC, but Tokyo generally agreed to limit exports of cars,
machine tools or textiles and complied with apparently dubious anti-dumping
rulings.
The 212-page Report on Unfair Trade Policies assesses the legal validity of
such unilateral action, and finds, in most cases, that Japan has been sinned
against. As such, the report is meant to be a warning that Japan will be
less willing to accept voluntary restraint agreements and would be
vindicated in any legal challenge against such agreements.
But there are two sides to a voluntary restraint agreement, and Japanese
companies and Miti have consistently buckled under US and EC pressure. A few
days before the report was released, Japanese electronics companies agreed
to provide confidential procurement information to help the
politically-influential US semiconductor industry.
Over the past year, Japan has assisted the US Eximbank in a co-operative
financing programme that helps US companies win third-country projects,
agreed to the introduction of a new five-year semiconductor pact, and set
targets for purchases of US-made car parts.
'We do have our problems,' a Miti official said yesterday. 'But we think
this report is important in establishing a legal framework for unfair
policies. We are not really comparing the countries' performance because the
report does not examine the degree of the problems in various countries.'
Apart from finding that various US and EC actions are unlawful, the report
emphasises that countries are hurting themselves by imposing restrictions on
trade. But there is also a blunt recognition that trade friction is
'unavoidable'.
'Friction is a product of development, an unavoidable way-station on the
road to further growth. Yet this is a difficult fact to grasp, perhaps
because trade friction is simply one kind of economic growing pain, and
growing pains are not easily recognised as such by those experiencing
growth,' the report concluded.
But the report implicitly shows that those growing pains are unusually
concentrated in the US-Japan region: 'With the one exception of
trade-related investment measures, the US employs unfair policies and
measures in nine areas out of 10 cited in this report.'
Those unfair policies include alleged quantitative restrictions on trade,
discrimination against foreign products in government procurement,
unilateral action against trading partners, arbitrary application of
anti-dumping measures, arbitrary changes in tariff classification, and
deficiencies in protecting intellectual property.
Trade negotiators in Washington were no doubt bemused to find government
procurement and intellectual property on the offence list, as these are two
areas in which the US claims Japan is deficient and which have been the
subject of constant negotiation in recent years.
The EC also scored six violation points out of a possible 10, having
allegedly failed on quantitative restrictions, government procurement,
anti-dumping, arbitrary application of country of origin rules, tariff
changes, and restrictions on trade in services.
Italy receives particular attention for its tough restrictions on Japanese
car exports, while France is cited for demanding that 40 per cent of films
broadcast be French, a rule that invites another unusual if mild warning
about European cultural development.
'These restrictive measures, ostensibly designed to preserve European
culture, are claimed to be politically unavoidable. These provisions,
however, have also been criticised as suppressing the dynamic development of
European culture,' the report says.
The Japanese government is determined to be more controversial, if gently so
on the issue of culture. But the Tokyo now fond of sending toughly-worded
letters to Brussels and Washington is yet to match these words with action
on rice market liberalisation or on making transparent some of its own
procurement practices.

A CONTROVERSIAL bill to permit Japanese troops to join United Nations
peace-keeping missions was due to enter its final stage of Diet
deliberations today.
The bill was approved by the Diet's upper house early yesterday by a vote of
137 to 102 after filibustering by opposition parties forced the chamber to
hold four exhausting all-night sessions. Although sometimes bordering on
farce, the Diet's deliberations have highlighted the deep concerns evoked by
the bill about a possible infringement of Japan's pacifist constitution.
The opposition Social Democratic party finally abandoned its delaying
tactics out of consideration for the health of some of its elderly members
and for public protests about wasting taxpayers' money. However, the smaller
communist party continued filibustering to the bitter end.
Both parties have pledged to fight the bill when it returns to the lower
house today for the deliberation of amendments. The lower house passed the
original bill last December but it has since been watered down in a vain
attempt to accommodate opposition party views.
The ruling Liberal Democratic party is confident that the bill will be
passed before the Diet ends on June 21 even though opposition party
officials vowed to block the measure. Party officials have threatened to
call a general election if the legislation fails. It would be held at the
same time as an election for upper house seats due in June.
The LDP often does well in such a 'double election' because it has more
money than the opposition so can more easily fund the extra campaigning. The
opposition parties say they would welcome a general election in order to put
the peace-keeping forces bill to the people.
There is an element of bluff on both sides - some senior officials in both
the LDP and opposition parties are against wasting valuable funds on an
unnecessary double election.
The bill would allow the government to despatch 2,000 troops to serve on
United Nations peace-keeping missions.
At the insistence of the opposition, Japanese participation will be limited
to support roles.
Japanese servicemen will be allowed to carry out combat duties only if the
Diet revises the bill on a future occasion. Even then, every despatch of
troops would be subject to a Diet veto.
Meanwhile, the delays over the bill have placed in jeopardy the plans of Mr
Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, to attend the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro. Mr Miyazawa, who was due to travel to Rio this weekend, may be
unable to leave Tokyo if problems emerge in the lowerhouse.
Nor will Mr Michio Watanabe, the foreign minister, be able to deputise for
the prime minister, either in Rio or in the Diet. Mr Watanabe has been
rushed into hospital for emergency treatment for gall stones.

PROSPECTS for a peaceful transition to democracy in South Africa will be
seriously threatened if the government fails to intervene effectively and
impartially to stop violence and curb security force excesses, says a study
today by human rights group Amnesty International.
The 100 page report, 'South Africa - State of Fear,' provides a catalogue of
security force involvement and complicity in political killings over the
past two years, noting that more than 7,000 people were victims of political
violence between January 1990 and March 1992.
'There seems to be little relation between the politics of negotiations
about the 'new South Africa' taking place at the national level and the
cynicism, distrust and fear evident at the grassroots,' the report says. It
calls on the government 'at the highest level to acknowledge publicly that
extrajudicial executions, torture and other grave human rights violations
continue to be committed by members of the security forces and others acting
apparently on their behalf or with their acquiescence.'
Amnesty says the government should make it clear that all people responsible
for such conduct will be brought to justice.
Although it acknowledges abuses on all sides, Amnesty focuses on human
rights violations committed by the government or its surrogates.

FT  10 JUN 92 / HK Democrats condemn British Secrets Act plan
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMOCRATS IN Hong Kong last night condemned a British decision to bypass the
local legislature and introduce the UK 1989 Official Secrets Act by
administrative means.
The colonial government sought to present the decision as a 'liberalisation'
of Hong Kong's laws governing official secrets. It said yesterday that the
1989 act would become law in Hong Kong at the end of this month after an
order by the Privy Council.
The United Democrats said the decree violated a 1984 pledge, enshrined in
the Hong Kong Act of 1985, that the colony would have the power to enact its
own laws. They vowed to campaign for its withdrawal. A spokesman said orders
in council fell outside jurisdiction of the colony's bill of rights. A law
so enacted would not be legal after Hong Kong reverted to Chinese
sovereignty in 1997.
This would create a vacuum Beijing would fill by applying its law to Hong
Kong in the same way - by order - thereby depriving Hong Kong people of a
say in an important piece of civil rights legislation. A dangerous precedent
had been set.
The government said the Privy Council's decision did not rule out a move to
localise the law through Hong Kong legislation. But it has shown little
inclination to do so. If the government were to introduce local legislation
it would first have to seek China's approval. Measures which span 1997 are
the subject of Anglo-Chinese negotiation.
Given the poor state of Hong Kong-Beijing relations, latterly strained by
disagreement over financing the colony's HKDollars 120bn (Pounds 8.5bn)
airport, the government is reluctant to raise the issue with China.
China has urged the Hong Kong government to relieve Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank of its residual central banking powers as the bank is 'paring its
commitment' to the colony.
The Beijing-funded China News Service said the government should 'enhance
further its financial supervision' in the colony now that 'the HSBC intends
to fade out from Hong Kong'.
The government 'should strengthen its control' over the domestic money and
foreign exchange markets. It did not mention Hongkong Bank's role as a note
issuer or clearing system manager.

ISRAEL yesterday partially relaxed tough new rules put into force on Monday
restricting the number of Palestinians from the Gaza Strip allowed to work
in Israel following protests from Israeli employers whose businesses were
threatened by the regulations.
The hasty climbdown underscored the dilemma Gaza has posed the hardline
Likud government as the June 23 general election approaches. It sealed Gaza
to prevent a repeat of a fatal stabbing of an Israeli schoolgirl near Tel
Aviv, which led to furious protests over security policy. But Likud ideology
also dictates that Gaza is an integral part of Israel and Israeli industries
such as construction have come to depend heavily on cheap Gazan labour.
The Labour opposition argues that Israel cannot absorb Gaza and the West
Bank, which should be allowed to develop as a separate entity.
Yesterday's regulations dropped the lower age limit for Gazans allowed to
work in Israel to 25 from 28.

THE Swiss-Swedish group Asea Brown Boveri (ABB) has been commissioned to
develop and operate an ADollars 2bn (Pounds 800m) coal-fired power station
in Western Australia.
The 600 MW plant in Collie in the state's south-west region will be the
first big privately-funded and owned power station in Australia.
Much of the funding is due to be raised through the issue of special
infrastructure bonds to be arranged by the consortium's financial adviser,
Bankers Trust Australia. The bonds, which attract concessional tax rates,
were introduced by the Commonwealth government in February to encourage
private financing of large infrastructure projects.
The Collie plant was originally to have been developed by a syndicate led by
Australia's Transfield Group and Japan's Mitsubishi Corporation. The Western
Australia government awarded the mandate in October but withdrew it in April
when Mitsubishi Transfield failed to raise funding at rates that would
deliver its promised electricity prices.

THE newly-elected leaders of the Czech and Slovak republics have agreed to
try to form quickly an interim federal government despite deep differences
over the future federal state revealed at their first meeting which ended
early yesterday.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, Czech leader of the Civic Democratic party (ODS), said the
six-hour meeting revealed 'completely different positions' on the future of
the 74-year-old federation. He said the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia,
led by Mr Vladimir Meciar, was 'not interested' in a common state.
'They are for a vague economic and defence union, a community of two
sovereign states modelled more on the Visegrad Alliance (between
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland) or a mini-European Community than a
federation,' he said.
'We have no illusion about the chances for success and stability for such an
unusual configuration,'
At a press conference Mr Klaus reiterated that his party demanded what he
called a 'working federation', continuation of economic reforms and the
re-election of Mr Vaclav Havel as president as the basis for a reformed
federal state.
The Slovak leader has publicly refused to support President Havel's
candidature and declared his intention to proclaim a sovereign Slovakia with
its own constitution and president.  He has also expressed radically
different economic ideas, including the demand for a Slovak central bank.
Mr Klaus said the two sides had not even started to discuss economic matters
during their talks which will resume in Prague tomorrow.
However, they agreed on the need to form an interim federal government as
soon as possible and will discuss details of a skeleton administration at
their next meeting.
Mr Klaus said that the first round of talks, which took place in Brno, the
Moravian capital, halfway between Prague and Bratislava, took place in a
'calm and business-like manner'. In spite of the depth of their
disagreements neither wants to be seen as being responsible for a future
Break-up of the federal state.

SERB forces resumed their bombardment of Sarajevo yesterday and street
battles flared again in the Bosnian capital where many of the 300,000
encircled residents, including Serbs, face starvation, Reuter reports from
Belgrade.
Fighting broke out towards midday after Serb forces held their fire during
the night, regrouping after suffering their first setback in a two-month
siege.
Residents described the renewed fighting as intermittent shelling, less
intense than on Monday when Sarajevo's Moslem and Croat defenders, defying a
two-month siege by Serb irregulars, staged their first counter-offensive
after three days of blistering Serb bombardments. The fighting left streets
littered with bodies and rubble and handed the Serb irregulars ringing
Sarajevo their first setback. Unofficial estimates said dozens of people
were killed and more than 350 wounded.
Moslem and Croat forces yesterday fought to hold positions seized from Serb
irregulars in Vraca, Vidikovac and Zuc, one of the main positions for firing
artillery, rockets and mortars at Sarajevo.
Local journalists said there was fighting around Nedjarici, with the Moslem
and Croat defence forces trying to push towards the Serb-held airport.
Military observers and diplomats said it was not possible to tell how many
fighters were in the hills or in the city. They said there were certainly
more than 20,000 on each side waging what appears to be the key battle of
the Bosnian conflict.

THE RUSSIAN president, Mr Boris Yeltsin, is expected shortly to appoint the
top brass for the new Russian armed forces which are being built from the
remains of the Red Army, writes Leyla Boulton in Moscow.
General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence minister, said yesterday that the
names of new deputy ministers, new commanders for the army, navy, air force
and other services would be announced within days. He also said that there
would be a reshuffle of some military district commanders.
The new deputy ministers are to be 'new people' - leaving no room for
deputies from the formerly Soviet and now so-called Commonwealth defence
ministry. Gen Grachev said they would be selected on a 'democratic' basis -
from multiple candidates who were presently in Moscow for the final
selection procedures.
But it is also clear that President Yeltsin will be looking for people whose
loyalty he can rely on most at a time of political instability, and low
morale within the armed forces.

<TEXT>
THE CRISIS over Czechoslovakia's future as a federal state is taking place
against the background of a political landscape which has already been
transformed by last weekend's elections.
The anti-communist intellectuals, who kept passive resistance alive after
the 1968 Soviet invasion and led the 'velvet revolution' of November 1989
have been eclipsed. Their movements, the Civic Forum in the Czech lands and
its Slovak version, the former 'Public Against Violence', were already
gravely weakened by earlier splits. Both failed to gain the 5 per cent of
votes needed for seats in parliament.
The consequent departure of men like Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the foreign
minister, and 12 other members of the outgoing 18-man federal government,
has weakened President Vaclav Havel.
He looks like an isolated monument from that brief period of euphoria when
poets and philosophers replaced apparatchiks. His re-election next month has
been threatened by the opposition of Slovak nationalists and former
communists although he retains the affection of many ordinary Czechs and
Slovaks.
But the polarisation of politics between 'left-wing' nationalists in
Slovakia and 'right-wing' market reformers in the Czech lands which has put
the federation at risk has also weakened other 'centrist parties', like the
former ruling Christian Democrats in Slovakia.
The erosion of the centre, and the return to respectability of the
communists, especially in their reformed and renamed Slovak version under
the young and personable Mr Peter Weiss, has greatly narrowed the victors'
scope for coalition-forming.  In Slovakia, Mr Vladimir Meciar, the former
communist whose nationalist Movement for a Democratic Slovakia (HZDS) just
failed to win an overall majority in the Slovak National Council, has to
choose between Mr Jozef Prokes, leader of the outright separatist Slovak
National Party, or the Democratic Left Party (DLS) of Mr Weiss.  First
indications, after talks with both leaders yesterday, are that Mr Meciar is
leaning towards the reform communists.
An alliance with the DLS would give Mr Meciar both more seats - and more
flexibility in talks on the federal future. The choices open to Mr Vaclav
Klaus, whose Civic Democratic Movement won 80 out of 300 seats in the
federal assembly, are more limited.
The size of his electoral success squeezed out his naturally, the Civiv
Democratic Alliance (CDA) and his right-hand man, Mr Vladimir Dlouby, the
former federal economics minister.
The failure of the Civic Democratic Alliance to surmount the 5 per cent
barrier means that Mr Klaus will need other allies than a handful of Czech
and Slovak Christian Democrats.
In order to confront the Slovak nationalists and Czech and Slovak
ex-communists ranged against him in the federal parliament he needs a deal
with the Social Democrats, who up to now he has dismissed as unrealistc
believers in 'a third way' between capitalism and communism.
Ironically, a decision to end the federation would greatly simplify politics
in both republics.
Both Mr Meciar and Mr Klaus dominate their republican parliaments and would
be able to implement policies which would move both halves of the present
republic in opposite directions.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Spanish establishment divided by a reputation: Scandal
surrounding the Bank of Spain's governor is changing the face of a nation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'The main activity of the Ibercorp group is speculation and the support of
its own share prices. Even if equity is greater than the minimum required
 . we have doubts about the viability of Ibercorp.' Bank of Spain inspectors
report, February 6, 1992.
'At its last inspection Banco Ibercorp did not have any problems and no
shortfalls of any kind  .. the bank was found to be in perfect condition.'
Mariano Rubio, Governor of the Bank of Spain, to parliamentary committee,
February 20, 1992.
GOLF partners will sometimes joke that Mr Mariano Rubio, the governor of the
Bank of Spain, has a handicap which does not always reveal what a good
player he is. But none of them thinks of him as a liar.
Nevertheless, when he sits before a parliamentary committee in Madrid today
to explain how, in February, he told them that a bank under his supervision
was 'in perfect condition' when his inspectors quite plainly thought it was
not (and which two weeks later collapsed) he will be fighting to salvage one
of the most distinguished reputations in Spanish public life.
The scandal that ruined Ibercorp has already destroyed any chance of Mr
Rubio being re-appointed governor for a third term next month. It has buried
a social and financial establishment and begun a media war which threatens
to reshape Spain's opinion-making machinery.
Mr Rubio has already explained that his testimony in February was
technically correct. The Ibercorp group's bank, at the time, had assets
worth more than its liabilities and as governor he was never going to
suggest in public that a bank might be in trouble because the inevitable
result was that it would be.
But the scandal has deeper roots. On February 12, the young newspaper, El
Mundo, claimed that Mr Rubio and a host of society figures had been favoured
in a share transaction made by Ibercorp's president and founder, Mr Manuel
de la Concha and his partner, Mr Jaime de Soto.
Mr de la Concha had been a close friend of the governor (and his broker) for
25 years.
A former stock exchange chairman, Mr de la Concha and Mr Soto had been given
a banking licence by the Bank of Spain to open a small bank in the late
1980s when Mr Rubio was granting a string of similar licences. El Mundo
reported, in a story subsequently confirmed by the stock market commission,
that funds being managed by Mr de la Concha on behalf of Mr Rubio and Mr
Miguel Boyer, a former finance minister, and members of their families, had
been invested in an Ibercorp subsidiary, Sistemas Financieras (SF). In the
spring of 1990, SF suddenly accumulated large amounts of its own stock.
Investigating this, the commission asked Ibercorp for a list of the people
who had sold SF shares back to SF. The list was incomplete and a second
list, supplied under pressure, revealed that someone had deliberately
omitted Mr Rubio's name from the first list and disguised the names of Mr
Boyer and his wife, Mr De Soto and Mr de la Concha and members of his
family.
The SF share price collapsed soon after it had accummulated its own stock.
Thus Mr Rubio and the others had been able to get rid of their stock while
lesser shareholders in SF were abandoned to their fate.
Both Mr Rubio and Mr Boyer insist that they did not know their names were
being omitted and altered and Mr Rubio insists that he did not interfere
with Mr de la Concha's handling of his modest Dollars 120,000 (Pounds
66,000) portfolio.
Mr Rubio's association with Mr de la Concha was poorly judged but easy to
understand. They were at university together and, like many young men at the
time, disliked both the Franco dictatorship and its radical opponents.
It was they who became the capitalist, modernising elite in Spain towards
the end of the dictatorship and who - as an informal network of civil
servants, financiers and businessmen - oiled the wheels of economic reform
after Spain became a democracy. Newly free and hungry for glamour, the media
dubbed a core group of these reformers los butiful.
But the past three or four years have seen new faces take the high ground in
Spanish business life. Two newcomers, in particular, have shaken the
establishment - Mr Mario Conde, who was appointed president of one of the
country's biggest banks, Banesto, in 1988, and Mr Javier de la Rosa, a
Catalan entrepreneur who partnered the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) in a
Dollars 5bn investment drive in Spain in the late 1980s and who is now the
country's most powerful individual investor.
As convenient new arrivals, these two have been blamed, in certain
newspapers supporting the governor, for starting a campaign to unseat Mr
Rubio. This conspiracy theory is full of holes, though, and ignores the fact
that Ibercorp was well known for the number of people who joined and quickly
left it.
What the conspiracy theory does do is concentrate a fierce media battle
around Ibercorp as establishment newspapers and magazines have rushed to try
and fault El Mundo's campaigning journalism. This war reached its zenith on
May 31 when the imperious El Pais, until then regarded as being above petty
rivalries, published a long editorial, attacking El Mundo.
With El Pais having jumped off its perch to attack his accusers, Mr Rubio
could not have found a more powerful ally when he goes before MPs today.

<TEXT>
MR OSKAR Lafontaine, enfant terrible of Germany's opposition Social
Democratic Party (SPD) and lately candidate for German Chancellor, was
yesterday fighting for his political life.
For an hour in front of the parliament of his native Saarland, the abrasive
and frequently mischievous deputy leader of the SPD sought to prove that he
was not guilty of bending the rules of official pension rights to gain a
tidy windfall of around DM100,000 (Pounds 34,364).
He even produced two charts, with red lines and black lines to show his
actual and potential income, to prove that he was facing nothing more than a
'dirty character assassination campaign' by his political opponents.
The charge against Mr Lafontaine, raised to the level of a no confidence
debate in the Saarland parliament, where he is prime minister, is that he
managed to draw a full pension from the age of 42, in addition to his
ministerial salary, thanks to his former position as mayor of Saarbrucken.
The accusation, first published in the magazine Der Spiegel, comes on top of
a series of reports about extravagant spending by the tiny German state,
which is dominated by declining coal and steel industries.
The magazine reported that the Saarland premier, aged only 48, had
nonetheless drawn a pension as mayor on top of his DM18,000 monthly salary
and DM7,000 monthly expenses as a member of parliament.
Mr Lafontaine now must wait until tomorrow to see if he will survive the
probable vote of no confidence.

<TEXT>
WEST German industrialists expect output to return to normal at the end of
1993, and grow at an average 2.5 per cent a year for the following three
years, according to Ifo, the Munich economics research institute.
The manufacturing workforce will fall 1.6 per cent this year, a further 0.5
per cent in 1993, and will then start to increase again, but only by 0.1 per
cent a year.
The forecasts, gleaned from a detailed survey of 400 large companies'
medium-term outlook, suggest that while confidence is rising again,
employment and investment plans have been affected by increasing labour
costs in Germany and fears of fading competitiveness.
The survey showed annual growth in new investment in Germany stagnating at
the 5.1 per cent expected this year.
A separate Ifo survey of 500 economists in 62 countries showed rising
confidence abroad. The April poll showed that after further deterioration in
the first quarter of this year, gross national product was forecast to
increase by an average 2.4 per cent over the full 12 months.
The highest rates, 4.9 per cent and 3.4 per cent, were expected in Asia and
Latin America. Growth in western Europe will be limited to 1.6 per cent and
to 2.1 per cent in north America.
West German industry's order books are still feeling the effects of
recession abroad and flat demand at home. The value of incoming orders in
April was 2 per cent lower than in March, the economics ministry said.

THE LEADERS of Ireland's four main political parties made a joint call
yesterday for a 'yes' vote in the referendum on the Maastricht Treaty which
is to be held on June 18.
In a rare display of cross-party unity, the leaders of Fianna Fail, Fine
Gael, Labour and the Progressive Democrats, which between them represent 153
of the 166 seats in the Irish parliament (Dail), said that following
Denmark's rejection of the Treaty, 'it is, more than ever, vitally important
for Ireland, and for Europe, that the people of Ireland vote 'Yes' . . . a
'No' vote would be clearly against our national interest'.
Of particular importance for Ireland is the proposed doubling of EC
structural and cohesion funds for the four 'Objective 1' countries, made
under the Delors II proposals, and under which Ireland would hope to obtain
IPounds 6bn (Pounds 5.5bn) for the 1994-98 period, as opposed to IPounds 3bn
for 1989-93. Both the UK and Germany have expressed strong reservations over
the Delors II package, as they would be the main contributors.
Mr Bertie Ahern, the finance minister, was yesterday expected to emphasise
to his fellow-EC finance ministers the importance of the funds for Ireland
and for Irish voters' perceptions of the Maastricht Treaty. He is hoping to
be able to bring back to Dublin some reassurances that the money will indeed
be available.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, warned yesterday, however, that
Ireland 'would not even have a place at the negotiating table' to argue for
its share of the structural funds if the country votes 'No'.

Lack of transparency in EC policy-making is one reason for popular
scepticism about further European integration, Germany's deputy finance
minister argued yesterday.
Mr Horst Ko'hler reaffirmed his country's commitment to further European
integration despite the setback of the Danish vote against the Maastricht
treaty last week.
He was backed by other finance ministers, including Mr Guido Carli of Italy,
who said that the Danish referendum result should strengthen rather than
weaken EC states' resolve to maintain the tight economic discipline needed
for economic and monetary union.
But the ministers steered clear of the sensitive subject of treaty
ratification during the formal business of their meeting.
'We are trying to continue business as usual, in line with the conclusions
reached in Oslo,' said a spokesman for the Portuguese presidency of the EC.
'That is the clearest sign which could be given to the markets.'
The proposed 1993-97 EC budget again came under attack during the meeting,
with Germany, France, Belgium, the Netherlands and the UK coming out
strongly against the planned hefty increase in EC spending.
The so-called Delors II package would push up spending from Ecu66.6bn this
year to Ecu87.5bn in 1997, at 1992 prices.
Mr Ko'hler told journalists before the debate that the budget should not be
merely a list of the Commission's wishes for which cash had to be found.
Ministers also heard the tough judgments of the monetary committee of EC
national treasury officials and the Community's financial watchdog, the
Court of Auditors.
Mr Cees Maas, the Dutch treasury official who heads the monetary committee,
told ministers that 'cohesion' funds for poorer EC members should not be
released until those nations had achieved strict economic convergence
targets.
The poorer southern countries argue they need the funds first to help them
meet the targets.
The Court of Auditors, which was asked to report on the lessons of past
budget plans, has warned of the risk of losing control of spending in key
areas of the budget, notably agriculture and structural funds.
Earlier, ministers gave their broad backing to Spain's plans for
convergence. Mr Pedro Perez, the Spanish secretary of state for finance,
said Spain believed the plan was right for the economy with or without EMU,
whose future has been clouded by a Danish vote last week to reject the
Maastricht Treaty.
The programme, which has already been approved by Madrid, would cut the
government spending deficit to 1 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) by
1996 from 4.4 per cent last year.
The finance ministers were expected to be up until late last night tackling
the difficult technical questions of VAT harmonisation and common capital
rules for the European securities industry.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Regulators disagree on state of financial services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TREASURY may be called on to settle a dispute between regulators
following the publication yesterday by the Office of Fair Trading of two
reports which fiercely criticise the regulation of retail investments.
The OFT asked two consumer affairs consultants, Jeremy Mitchell and Helena
Wiesner, to prerpare separate reports. Both found that there were 'market
failures' in financial services, resulting from public ignorance and the
commissions paid to intermediaries.
One report said: 'A commission-based remuneration system poses substantial
conflicts of interest for intermediaries and can have a deleterious effect
on the type of product a consumer is advised to buy, and for independent
financial advisers, also on the company from which that product is bought.'
It also criticised the scope of retail regulation, and the fact that
building societies, unlike insurance and other investment products, are not
regulated under the Financial Services Act.
If the OFT accepts the reports' conclusions, Sir Gordon Borrie, the
director-general of fair trading, would be brought into direct conflict with
the Securities and Investments Board, which regulates most of the financial
services industry.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, would then be called on to make a final
decision. However, the OFT stressed the reports were aimed at 'stimulating
discussion' and did not commit the office to the recommendations. It said
the reports had revealed much useful information.
The SIB announced last month it would not force independent financial
advisers to reveal the commissions they received from investment companies
in cash terms at point of sale.
It also allowed life companies to quote illustrations for potential buyers
on the assumption that their costs were in line with the industry average -
even if their expenses were much higher.
Both decisions are attacked in the OFT's reports, which said: 'Clear
information about costs and other features of the product or service are
essential. This is patently not the case as far as the provision of
independent advice is concerned.'
When Sir David Walker, out-going chairman of the SIB, announced the results
of his review, he admitted he disagreed with Sir Gordon on commission
disclosure. He added: 'Ultimately, if he persists in his view, and I persist
in mine, then we will have to leave ministers to decide.'
The OFT will be unable to act until the SIB's proposed rules have been fully
drafted, which will probably not be until the end of next month. At that
point, the director-general could advise Mr Lamont to change the proposals.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Lower phone bills likely as Oftel tells BT to cut prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER PHONE bills are in prospect after BT, the telecommunications group,
was told yesterday to accept a tough new pricing regime or face
investigation by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, proposed that BT should be forced
to cut the average level of its prices by 7.5 percentage points below the
rate of inflation, compared with 6.25 points at present.
Given the current level of inflation at 4.3 per cent, this would mean many
customers would receive cuts in their phone bills.
In order to help small customers, connection charges would be cut to Pounds
99 from the present Pounds 152.75 and a more generous scheme would be
introduced for those who seldom use the phone.
Moreover, BT, which wanted to increase line rental charges by 8 points more
than inflation annually, would only be allowed to increase them by 2 points.
In making its proposals, Oftel wants to ensure that residential customers
share the benefits of price cuts. It also wants to help the company's rivals
compete against it.
The overall package, which is harsher on BT than expected, is the testament
of Sir Bryan Carsberg before he leaves his post as Oftel director-general at
the end of this week to head the Office of Fair Trading.
The proposals have been strongly influenced by widespread criticism that
BT's profits - Pounds 3.07bn in the last financial year - are excessive and
that domestic customers have received a poor deal since the company was
privatised in 1984.
Even so, business customers would still be the main beneficiaries of the
regime, seeing their bills fall by about 10 percentage points below
inflation each year. The average residential customer would receive a 3 per
cent cut in real terms.
The tougher regime, which would start next year, is expected by Oftel to cut
BT's profitability - as measured by return on capital employed - from about
22 per cent in the last financial year to between 16.5 and 18.5 per cent
over four years.
BT said the proposals were 'harsher than we expected and raise some serious
business issues which will take time for us to evaluate'. Privately,
executives are accusing Oftel of gross interference in their business.
User groups generally welcomed the regime, while arguing that BT should also
have been forced to hand back 'excess profits' to customers by making a
one-off cut in prices.
BT has been given two weeks to respond. If it refuses to accept the regime,
it will be referred to the MMC which can impose a solution.
Mr Bill Wigglesworth, who is taking over as Oftel director-general in an
interim capacity, said there was little room for negotiation with BT.
Oftel also told BT that it would have to publish separate accounts for its
main businesses from next year.
BT's shares fell 8p to 354p.

FT  10 JUN 92 / Labour sets out conditions for Maastricht vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR WARNED the govern-ment yesterday that it would back ratification of
the Maastricht treaty only if Britain abandoned the waiver exempting it from
provisions for a new social chapter of workplace rights.
The move, intended to maximise the discomfiture of the government in the
wake of the Danish referendum, came as Tory backbenchers met to plan a new
broadly-based group to oppose any further progress on the Maastricht bill,
now shelved until the autumn.
Speaking at Commons' question time, Mr Roy Hattersley, Labour's deputy
leader, said the party would 'only support' a bill which included those
parts of the treaty most of benefit to the British people 'and that
specifically includes the social chapter'.
His words were taken as giving notice that Labour would no longer abstain
from voting but would instead side with Conservative opponents of the
Maastricht agreement by voting against ratification of the treaty.
The tactic puts further pressure on the government which is already coming
under intense lobbying from its own backbenches to abandon the Maastricht
agreement.
Several rightwing members of the cabinet have also emerged as doggedly
opposed to ratification of the treaty as it stands. While some may favour a
dilution of the existing treaty terms, there is no prospect of the
government dropping its opt-out from the treaty's social provisions.
In reply to Mr Hattersley, Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons
standing in for the prime minister, said it was now up to all 12 members
states to look for ways forward following the Danish decision to oppose
ratification.
'That is a sensible policy and for you to pretend there is some simple, neat
and immediate answer is absurd,' he said.
In Strasbourg, Mr John Smith, odds-on favourite for the Labour leadership,
outlined the case for a general realignment of currencies within the
European Exchange Rate Mechanism.
In a significant policy development for Labour, he argued that an upward
alignment of the D-Mark against other currencies would trigger reductions in
interest rates across the Community, reversing the 'deflationary bias
currently operating in the ERM'.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Moscow's mayor quits to seek new challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Boris Yeltsin has accepted the resignation of Moscow's mayor, Mr
Gavriil Popov, a former comrade-in-arms who wants to try demolishing
socialism in Russia at large because doing it in the capital alone is too
difficult.
The departure at the weekend of one of the pioneers of Russia's
anti-communist movement just one year after his direct election to the post
means the loss of a controversial ally for Mr Yeltsin.
The stocky economist, whose disdain for ties is matched by an equally
idiosyncratic political style, said he wanted to campaign in national
politics in the run-up to an autumn referendum on whether Russia should have
private land ownership and a strong presidency. But Mr Popov has resigned to
head a weakling Russian Movement for Democratic Reform (another unpromising
attempt to encourage party politics in an arena dominated by strong
personalities).
An avowed democrat who acted like an autocrat, Mr Popov is believed to be
positioning himself for higher office before his failure to deliver concrete
benefits for Moscow's 9m inhabitants tarnishes his image nationwide.
'He considers that the latest steps, including new cabinet appointments, by
Yeltsin are very dangerous,' said Mr Arkady Murashov, the Moscow police
chief who is also thinking of resigning following the departure of his
patron.

commercially-producing offshore oilfield comes on stream
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Flaring illuminates the night sky over Canada's first commercially-producing
offshore oilfield, 250km south-east of Halifax, Nova Scotia.
Lasmo Nova Scotia, a subsidiary of the UK oil exploration company Lasmo,
this week commenced production at the Cohasset development, representing an
important milestone in the 30-year quest to establish commercial production
from Canada's substantial offshore fields.
The CDollars 260m (Pounds 119m) Cohasset development comprises two offshore
fields, Cohasset and Panuke, with estimated recoverable reserves of about
50m barrels of light crude.
Only the Panuke field is currently producing, but development drilling on
Cohasset will commence next year, bringing production to around 40,000
barrels a day for the next six years. A third field, Balmoral, 3 km (2
miles) north of the existing facilities, will later be tied into Cohasset by
a subsea pipeline.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Securing pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AS Maxwell company pension scheme members besieged the House of Commons
yesterday Mr Peter Lilley, Secretary of State for Social Security, confirmed
that the government is to begin making payments to dispossessed pensioners
and is launching an independent inquiry into the legal framework under which
pension schemes operate.
For obvious reasons the government is playing down the implications of its
financial support. This is, it says, only a temporary grant of funds until
assets illegally diverted can be recovered from the banks. Obviously Mr
Lilley is anxious to avoid any general commitment to bail out troubled
occupational pension schemes. He prefers to argue that by putting legal and
moral pressure on the banks and others involved in this pensions debacle he
can recover the government's money. But it is not clear that the state's
responsibilities can be judged tangential.
Certainly, the occupational pensions industry will take these developments
seriously. The hint of a central state guarantee for occupational schemes
could potentially cost schemes very dearly in terms of operational
restrictions and legal constraints. The actual and potential risks of
occupational schemes have barely been recognised officially, but now they
must be considered, whether directly by the state or, more likely in due
course, through a formal industry-wide compensation scheme.
Pension schemes will have to be run in ways that make them, in effect,
insurable. This will mean following laid-down rules not only on the
questions of safe custody of assets and independent inspection of operations
which arise directly from the Maxwell affair, but also on prudence in
investment and on the maintenance of minimum funding standards. Even the
pronouncements of venerable actuaries on the solvency of schemes might need
to be brought under the microscope.
The independent committee under Professor Roy Goode has, rightly, been given
a broad remit to examine pension scheme law as a whole. It has taken a
shocking case of fraud to trigger such an inquiry, but the committee should
not feel obliged to confine itself to narrowly criminal questions of
security and supervision. Millions of scheme members in the past have
suffered losses on a smaller but still serious scale through the inequitable
operation of scheme rules; hazards have included poor transfer values and
the inadequate protection of pensions against inflation. The ability of
employers to access surpluses through contribution holidays, early
retirement initiatives and scheme mergers also needs examination.
The role of the government itself must also be examined. Pension law needs
to be reconsidered even in respect of such relatively recent law as the
Financial Services Act of 1986. Fraud has prompted this welcome review, but
the committee will only do its job if it roams across the whole field of
occupational pensions.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Arts: Why the sum is greater than the parts - BP Portrait
Award
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The measure of any regular exhibition chosen from an open submission of work
is not so much its particular qualities and differences in any given year,
but the nature of the constituency it sustains in the longer term. By such a
standard the Portrait Award can only be judged an remarkable success.
Of course the work each year will be different, especially so, as is the
case with the BP Portrait Award, when an age limitation, up to 40, takes old
regulars out of contention while new faces appear. No such show can ever be
better than the work submitted, yet it is curious how often the sum seems to
be greater than the parts.
There are large paintings and small; conversation-pieces and single figures;
full, half and three-quarter lengths; heads alone. The range of practical
approach is quite as wide, from the loose and indulgently expressionist to
the most closely observed and clearly stated.
That range is fairly reflected in the works singled out for prizes and
commendation: with Alec Chanda's large, loose and ambiguous painting, of a
figure in a wheel-chair, winning the Pounds 4,000 second prize and the
Travel Award that now goes with it, on the one hand; and Ishbel Myerscough's
half-length 'Hairy Man' on the other, a closely objective scrutiny of the
figure in the manner of the 16th century German masters, that takes the
third prize of Pounds 2000.
One always disagrees with the judges, all the more so when the standard
overall is admirably high and so many of the entries in consequence
manifestly unlucky. Emily Feaver for example, with her disarmingly
straight-forward full-length self-portrait, deserved at least a
commendation. Of the six actually commended, with a consolation of Pounds
500 apiece, both Michael Clark, with a dense impasto grisaille head of an
old woman, and Martin Churchill, with his two slaughtermen at work in the
abattoir, were unlucky not to get more.
The Clark especially raises certain questions, for it is quite small and
deals only with the head, which is beautifully realised. Yet it is the
larger work that so often wins, as though to say that size itself denotes a
more serious purpose and ambition. This year both the first and second
prize-paintings may be fairly described as large.
The commended painting by Brendan Kelly, of a seated figure with a second,
standing figure seen through the open doorway, raises a second point. The
conversation-piece is a tradition in itself, and with its particular
opportunities and limitations it might warrant a category, if not a
competition, of it own.
Which leaves Lucy Willis the winner of the Award for 1992 of Pounds 10,000,
and a further commission of Pounds 2,000 to be arranged with the National
Portrait Gallery. Her painting, 'Her Majesty's Pleasure', shows some ten or
eleven prisoners sitting at a table, doing nothing. It is an awkward, quirky
painting, arbitrary in composition, in part closely observed, in part
ill-drawn and unresolved: a nervous, worried flicker of black hair and blue
shirts across the yellow canvas, arms, elbows and pencils staccato across
the table. It is at once visually worrying and oddly disturbing, a powerful
image.
With the Royal Academy and its Summer Show inevitably dominant, the work of
the other exhibiting societies tends to be overshadowed. The Royal Society
British Artists dates back to the 1820s and has counted such luminaries as
David Roberts, Whistler, Sickert and Peter Greenham among its presidents.
Its annual show is now on which, like the Royal Academy, needs no more than
a willingness to search out the particular from the mass, and draw one's own
conclusion. It seems less crowded than usual, perhaps for being so well hung
by its current president Tom Coates. Among much else, I would recommend his
work and that of Edward Bishop, Fred Cuming, Jack Millar and Hans Schwarz,
and a French landscape and a bunch of geraniums by Jim Russell.
The BP Portrait Award 1992: National Portrait Gallery, until September 5:
sponsored by British Petroleum The Royal Society of British Artists Annual
Exhibition: Mall Galleries, until June 13

FT  09 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Further setback but trading very thin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HOLIDAY closure of most stock markets in northern Europe deprived London
of much of its investment business yesterday. Share prices continued to fall
and traders were unhappy to see the FT-SE Index dip through another testing
level to close 22.7 down at 2,645.8.
Concern over sluggishness in the domestic economy was heightened by
disclosure of a very modest increase in consumer credit in April, regarded
as a sign that consumers still lack confidence. Nervousness over US credit
policy was not helped when a San Francisco Federal Reserve official was
quoted as doubting whether a further cut in US interest rates was justified
at present.
Much of the setback in the stock market was again led from the stock index
futures sector, where the June contract on the FT-SE Index traded at a
discount to its fair value quotation that allows for dividend flows and
financing costs.
A further decline in UK government bonds, partly reflecting sterling's
weakness in the ERM currency range, also continued to unsettle equities.
Share prices closed at the day's low point, rattled afresh by an
unimpressive start to the new Wall Street session, where the Dow shed 5
points in UK trading hours.
Traders were disinclined to read too much into yesterday's somewhat gloomy
picture, however, because of the lack of investment activity. Seaq-recorded
business totalled a mere 305.7m shares, compared with 536.4m on Friday. Many
stock prices were barely tested yesterday, Cadbury Schweppes, for example,
gaining several pence against the market trend with fewer than 1m shares
changing hands.
The downward trend in the market was emphasised by another heavy fall in
Midland Bank shares, putting them at an increasing discount to the value of
the largely paper bid from Hongkong and Shanghai Banking; the withdrawal of
Lloyds Bank from the fray is seen in London as the probable end of the
battle.
The arbitrageurs, who built large stakes in Midland Bank last week, have
turned highly apprehensive about the outlook for the HK and Shanghai share
price with which Midland's shares are now inevitably linked, and also for
the Hong Kong stock market itself. Midland shares were again sold heavily in
London yesterday.
With bid interest now sated for the present, the rest of the banking sector
followed Midland lower. US-influenced stocks were in the doldrums and the
domestic consumer issues were unsettled by the consumer credit data.
Strategists at the leading securities firms continued to express caution
over the near term outlook for UK equities, while remaining relatively
confident for the medium term. Mr Peter Thorne at Nikko remarked: 'The Danes
have introduced an element of uncertainty . . . ' He believes that although
the UK market is excellent value, it will continue to languish in the short
term.
At investment bank Barclays de Zoete Wedd, Mr Richard Kersley warned that
any early recovery in dividend growth, currently below 2 per cent
annualised, is far from likely.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures fell, trading at a discount to fair value for most of
the session following reports from the US indicating that a cut in interest
rates was unlikely in the near term, writes Joel Kibazo.
With no support from the other European markets which were closed, the early
firmness in the June contract on the FT-SE Index disappeared, sending it
down to 2,656 by mid-morning and pulling the underlying cash market lower.
The comments from the US caused a heavy bout of selling of the June future,
and the weakness in the gilts market was reported to have hurt sentiment
further, as did the poor opening on Wall Street.
June ended at 2,648, down 25 from the previous session and below its
estimated fair value premium of about 6. Volume at 6,190 lots was light.
Further falls in June were reported in after-hours' trading. Dealers also
talked about the increased business in September, in which more than 1,000
lots had been dealt by the official close.
In traded options, turnover in the FT-SE option of 12,875 accounted for the
bulk of the day's total volume of 27,900 contracts.
Continued selling of Midland Bank once again made it the most active stock
option of the day. It had 2,757 lots transacted, with the June 420 calls the
busiest series.

MORE HEAVY selling of Midland Bank by arbitrageurs, mostly from the US, who

They closed 27 down at 419p, having been as low as 414p. Turnover reached
12m. A leading trader in the shares commented: 'There was a panic to get out
first thing and the stock has barely recovered.'
It was suggested that arbitrageurs were not keen to take on Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking scrip and had sold their stock into the market. HK Banking
shares were believed to have met considerable selling pressure in the Far
East after London closed last night.
The rest of the banking arena was littered with sizeable falls, specialists
taking the view that the market would now concentrate on the bad news that
is still overshadowing the sector. A growing feeling that a Lloyds Bank move
against other so-called bid targets is now most unlikely left TSB 7 lower at
144p and Royal Bank of Scotland 9 off at 193p.
Standard Chartered, surrounded by worries that its exposure to hefty losses
in India may be way above the Pounds 50m figure already factored in by the
bank, dropped 12 to 464p. Lloyds, belaboured by the weekend press, lost 6 to
430p.
Utilities fall
The regional electricity companies were the major casualties in a generally
unhappy utilities area of the market, with SG Warburg Securities, the
leading UK brokerage, said by dealers to have instigated some substantial
selling of the individual stocks and the Electricity Package.
The broker was said to have highlighted the increased likelihood of
Professor Littlechild, the electricity regulator, launching an attack on the
profits achieved by the regional electricity stocks over the past year.
These were up 40 per cent on average, well above expectations, with dividend
growth expected to be some three times the rate of inflation and
substantially more than other utilities which have already been exposed to
the power of the regulatory bodies.
Warburg is thought to have adopted a particularly cautious stance on East
Midland (7 lower at 295p), Northern (3 off at 327p), Seeboard (5 easier at
323p) and Yorkshire Electricity (11 down at 362p). The Electricity Package
fell 48 to Pounds 3165.
A squeeze and full-year results in excess of market expectations combined to
cause a strong advance in UK airports operator BAA, making it the day's best
performing FT-SE Index stock.
The shares climbed 15 in early trading and were up 20 at the day's best
after the company reported annual profits of Pounds 192m, down 22 per cent
from the previous year's but better than market forecasts. Trading was
further enhanced by an accompanying statement predicting annual growth in
air travel of between 5 and 8 per cent.
Mr Christopher Will at Lehman Brothers said: 'This is a solid result in a
year that was difficult as the company recovered from the effects of the
Gulf war and the continued recession.' Mr Will maintained his forecast for
the year to March 1993 at a high Pounds 315m, which even he believes is 'a
little demanding'.
Cazenove was among leading brokers reported to have quickly moved to upgrade
forecasts. The shares eventually came off the top to close at 679p, up a net
14, with turnover rising to 2.4m.
ICI stood out with a 15 fall to 1312p amid concern that the European
Community's farm policy reforms would have an adverse effect on the
company's important agrochemicals business.
Wellcome, sustained by a bullish article on its Zovirax anti-herpes drug,
managed a minor rise against the market trend to close at 947p.
Vodafone eased a fraction to 370p ahead of today's preliminary figures,
which are expected to show profits of Pounds 265m, against last year's
Pounds 244m.
Excellent preliminary results with profits up 10 per cent helped Electronic
Data advance 12 to 525p. The recent BZW buy recommendation continued to
stimulate support for GEC, 2 firmer at 224p.
Trading in property issues was subdued ahead of this week's clutch of
results, with analysts saying that in the present depressed circumstances
dividends are likely to be of particular importance.
Great Portland Estates dipped 4 to 153p ahead of today's figures, while
Regalian, with results tomorrow, weakened 5 to 20p. British Land gave up 2
to 204p as the market awaited Thursday's data from the company.
Cadbury Schweppes was one of the brighter spots in the market, but in light
turnover, rising 6 to 475p. Mr Carl Short, food manufacturing analyst at
Nomura, said that although he had not changed his profits forecasts for this
year or next, he regarded the present share price as being attractive on
fundamentals alone.
He pointed out that the present price/earnings ratio is at a premium of only
6 per cent to the market, which historically is low for such a quality
stock. Mr Short added that the company appears to be doing well in spite of
the recession and that the underlying situation is good. This also
discounted the ongoing bid speculation centring on suggestions of a possible
offer from US tobacco group Philip Morris.
Regional brewer Marston Thompson and Evershed, in which Whitbread has a 36.6
per cent stake, gained 5 to a year's high of 264p ahead of today's results.
The shares continue to attract bid speculation on suggestions that the
national brewer's interests could be served best by selling its entire
holding in Marston.
Boots remained under a cloud, losing 12 to 447p, following disappointment
with the results announced last week and negative comment in a Sunday
newspaper about the company's long term strategy.
BPB retreated 6 to 180p after another profits downgrading, while Pilkington,
the glass manufacturer, dipped 5 to 132p ahead of Thursday's preliminary
figures, which some analysts say may see the company cut the dividend.
Euro Disney fell 20 to 1083p in thin trade as the stock continued to be hurt
by last week's disappointing results and Friday's reported credit rating
lowering by Morgan Stanley of Walt Disney, Euro Disney's US parent company.
Transport Development Group declined 12 to 280p. Downward profit revisions
are in the air after the company was reported to have indicated to City
analysts that current year expectations around the Pounds 43m mark may be a
little too high.
Lucas Industries receded 7 to 130p. There was talk that James Capel, which
cut its profits estimates for the company last week, was taking a further
look at the figures with a further downgrading a possibility.

FT  09 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities trade in thin range
for third day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
FOR THE third consecutive day US share prices traded in a narrow range
yesterday, amid growing uncertainty about the outlook for the economy and
equity values, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 5.45 at 3,404.14,
having spent the entire day no more than a few points either side of
Friday's close.
There was a similar lack of significant movement in other indices, with the
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 up 0.12 at 413.36 and the Amex composite off 0.73 at
396.43. The Nasdaq composite slipped 3.42 to 582.01. Turnover on the New
York SE came to 161m shares.
Although last Friday's unexpectedly weak May employment report raised hopes
that the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates once more to boost economic
activity, there was enough uncertainty surrounding monetary policy, and the
state of the economic recovery in general, to deter investors from buying
stocks in anticipation of a rate reduction.
Analysts also cited overnight weakness in foreign equity markets, notably in
Tokyo and London, and the lack of a direction from bond prices as other
reasons for the market's indecisive tone.
Even a multi-billion dollar merger between two big regional energy providers
failed to stir the market from its slumbers. Gulf States Utilities advanced
Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 15 3/4 in turnover of 2.06m shares after the
company agreed to a Dollars 2.3bn link-up with Entergy Corp, which eased
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 27.
After a delayed opening due to an order imbalance on the buy side, General
Dynamics jumped Dollars 5 5/8 to Dollars 71 in heavy trading on news that
the defence manufacturer will conduct a Dutch auction tender for up to 30
per cent of its stock. Analysts said the company could end up paying as much
as Dollars 75 a share for its stock.
Trading in Abbott Laboratories was also delayed at the start, and on its
resumption the stock plunged Dollars 4 1/8 to Dollars 27 3/4 in turnover of
9.3m shares as investors sold heavily on news that the company had withdrawn
its Omniflox antibiotic drug from the market because several patients had
suffered serious reactions to the drug.
Other medical shares which weakened in the wake of Abbott's decline included
Critical Care (already troubled by negative recent press coverage), down
Dollars 2 3/4 at Dollars 42 5/8 , and Baxter International, Dollars  3/4
lower at Dollars 36 1/8 .
Asarco improved Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 31 3/8 after Mr Vahid Fahti, an
analyst at Kemper Securities, raised his rating on the metals group from
'hold' to 'long-term buy', citing increasing demand for copper, which has
pushed the metal's price higher in a tight commodity market.
Canada
THE Toronto market also closed little changed after a moderate day's
trading. The TSE 300 index gained 1.9 at 3,394.5, but declines led advances
by 283 to 222 after volume of 20.9m shares valued at CDollars 254.2m.
Rio Algom fell CDollars 1 3/8 to CDollars 15 1/4 . The company said its
parent, RTZ Corp, is selling its 51 per cent interest in Rio Algom at
CDollars 16.50 a share.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark retains EMS strength
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
  By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK maintained its strength against most European currencies
yesterday, as the foreign exchange markets failed to shake off last week's
concern about the future of European Monetary Union (Emu), writes James
Blitz.
With most of Europe off on holiday, trading was thinner than usual. But that
did not stop the D-Mark making new gains against the Spanish peseta and
Italian lira in the wake of last week's decision by the Danish people not to
endorse the Maastricht treaty for closer political and economic union.
Against the D-Mark, the peseta ended at Pta63.12, after Friday's close of
Pta62.95, while the French franc gained only a small amount of ground,
finishing at FFr3.370 compared with a previous FFr3.372. Sterling closed
unchanged at DM2.9150. Traders said that neither the pound's performance nor
the French franc's was enough to suggest that the worries over Maastricht
were dying away.
Emu-related fears are threatening the Italian lira more than any other
currency, however. The market's view was that the Maastricht treaty would
force Italy to curb its huge budget deficit more resolutely than its own
politicians would. Yesterday, the lira slipped further against the German
currency, closing at L756.8, its lowest point since last December.
Analysts said this slippage is causing concern, especially considering that
the Bank of Italy was last week forced to raise its emergency funding rate
by  1/2 percentage point. Yesterday, one London bank reported that it had
received several calls from the Bank of Italy requesting prices of European
currencies, but there was no evidence that the Italian central bank had
intervened in the market.
There are now two important hurdles for the Italian currency. The first is
L760, the high point in D-Mark/lira trading last December. Analysts said
that if the lira crosses this threshold it could weaken to L764, its low
limit against the D-Mark in the European exchange rate mechanism.
The Bundesbank would be forced to intervene in the market and buy lire at
this stage to keep the Italian currency within its permitted bands. The Bank
of Italy might also have to lift its discount rate again to protect the
currency.
With no major US economic data out yesterday or today, dollar trading was
mostly subdued. The US currency regained some of last week's losses in the
European opening, but drifted back later in the day. The outcome was just
modest net improvements for the dollar against the D-Mark and yen, at
DM1.5895 from a previous finish of DM1.5880 and at around Y127.08 from
Y126.75. In New York it ended at DM1.5865 and Y127.28.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Short rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT rates in the sterling cash market ended the day slightly lower after
most of the Pounds 1.3bn shortage forecast by the Bank of England was
removed in morning operations.
One-month money finished  1/8 percentage point down from Friday's close, at
9 7/8 per cent, after the Bank of England bought more than Pounds 1bn of
bills from the market in the morning. The move pushed the overnight rate
down to a low of 6 1/2 per cent on the day.
At least one trader in a discount house expressed surprise that the Bank had
allowed the shortage to be taken out so quickly when sterling is at the
bottom of the European Monetary System grid and trading two pfennigs off
last week's levels.
However, other traders said the Bank was doing nothing unusual in its
operations. 'I wouldn't say that bolstering up the overnight would lead to a
stronger currency,' said one money market trader. 'The Bank would probably
want to reserve a tighter money policy for when it is more seriously worried
about a sterling slide.'
The remaining period rates finished unchanged. Everything from three-month
Libor out to one-year closed at 10 per cent. The overnight ended at 9 per
cent.
In its money market operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 437m of Band-1
bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 310m of Band-2 bank bills at 9 7/8 per
cent and Pounds 280m for resale to the market on June 29 at 9 15/16 per
cent. With the shortage later revised to Pounds 1.4m, the Bank bought Pounds
169m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 205m of Band-2 bank
bills at 9 7/8 per cent. The Bank did not operate in the afternoon.
Trade in sterling futures had a tone that was less technical, and more
bearish about base rate movements. The June short sterling contract traded
up three ticks on the day to 89.97. But the September contract went down to
90.15 yesterday, its lowest since the half-point reduction in base rates on
May 5.
This is the first time that the market has effectively dismissed the
possibility of a  1/4 point cut in rates between now and the autumn. The low
of 90.15 implied that 3-month Libor in September would be at 9.85 per cent.
The closing price of 90.18 implies that it will be at 9.82 per cent.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: IEA sees more signs of rising
oil demand
</HEADLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BY NEIL BUCKLEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER SIGNS of an upturn in oil demand are highlighted in this month's
report from the International Energy Agency, the west's energy monitoring
body, which predicts a 1.5 per cent rise in second-quarter demand among
members of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
This follows a 1.8 per cent rise in the first quarter, and the estimate has
been revised upwards after unexpectedly strong US demand in April. The IEA
has raised its US second-quarter consumption growth figure to 2.5 per cent.
This is expected to help OECD consumption grow to 37.4m barrels a day,
although demand is likely to remain unchanged in Europe and the Pacific.
Growing expectations of a tight market in the third quarter have already
seen oil prices gain more than Dollars 1.50 a barrel since the decision by
the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries last month to leave its
output ceiling unchanged. Brent crude for July delivery last week breached
the Dollars 21-a-barrel barrier for the first time in seven months. It
closed yesterday at Dollars 21.07 1/2 , down 17 1/2 cents.
In spite of Opec's agreed ceiling of 22.98m barrels a day, IEA estimates its
real production as 23.5m b/d in May, in line with a survey by the Reuter
news agency last week. However, a report from the magazine Petroleum
Intelligence Weekly puts Opec output at 23.81m b/d in May, with increased
production from Kuwait, Saudi Arabia and Venezuela, although much of the
increase was earmarked for storage.
Production in the former Soviet Union continued to decline, the IEA says, by
around 12 per cent year-on-year, averaging around 9.4m b/d in April, down
from 9.5m b/d in March. The decline was most severe in the Russian republic.
But exports recovered in April and early May.
The IEA says total OECD demand for 1992 is likely to average 38.6m b/d, an
increase of 1.5 per cent over 1991, with moderate growth in all regions.
World oil demand is forecast to be 67.0m b/d, an increase of 0.6m b/d over
1991.
Market analysts at Kleinwort Benson, the London merchant bank and securities
group, said the IEA's forecasts supported their view that the price of Brent
crude was likely to average Dollars 20 for the year.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Farmer's Viewpoint: CAP yields heavy crop of confusion -
Growers lack the information needed to plan for the coming season
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS EUROPEAN grain growers gather this week in Stoneleigh, Warwickshire, for
the UK's annual practical demonstration at an event entitled Cereals 92, one
topic will dominate their discussions: the incredibly confused implications
of the reform package to change the nature of the European Community's
common agricultural policy.
For although the May 21 agreement by the community's agriculture ministers
may be old news for the collective Euromedia, which has long since
transferred its attention to fall-out from the negative vote on the
Maastrich agreement in the Danish referendum, the details of what exactly
has been agreed on farm reform are still far from clear. Indeed about the
only thing that is clear is that some of those details affecting UK farmers
are still being worked out by European Commission and Whitehall officials
and may not become available for some months.
Furthermore my inquiries have detected a distinct lack of urgency among some
of the officials responsible, who seem to think there is plenty of time. In
reality, however, farmers need to make crucial management and purchasing
decisions within the next few days and weeks.
The primary purpose of the reform package is, of course, to reduce the
production of cereals and other surplus commodities across the EC. In simple
terms it will cut guaranteed prices by 30 per cent in stages over three
years and compensate growers on the basis of average regional yields
according to a graduated scale over the period. In order to qualify for the
compensation, however, farmers will have to set-aside 15 per cent of their
usual acreage of cereals, oil seeds, peas and beans, for which they will
also be compensated.
In other words growers will have a choice; to set aside the required acreage
and take the compensation or to attempt to grow and sell the crops in
question at a profit, without benefit of compensation, even though the
prices they will receive for them will be substantially reduced.
I am bound to say that I believe economics will almost certainly dictate
that set-aside will normally be the most profitable policy. It may, however,
pay some especially efficient UK farmers on the highest quality, most
productive soils to reject EC compensation and to continue to farm all their
land for high yields.
But they cannot make this calculation with accuracy because no decision has
yet been taken on the actual levels of compensation that will be paid. All
that is known is that it will rise to an average of Pounds 208 per hectare
by 1996 and that for individual farms it will be based on historic average
yields across specific regions of the EC, yet to be defined, and that the
higher the average the greater will be the level of compensation.
In other words, those who have been in the habit of growing average or below
average yields within whatever is eventually decided is their region will be
fully or even over-compensated for their loss of income compared with the
old system, whereas those who usually grew above average crops will be worse
off.
For the purposes of approximate calculations most UK consultants have used a
figure of 5.82 tonnes per hectare (2.35 tonnes per acre) which is the
official average yield of wheat for England and assumes that the UK will be
divided into four regions; England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland.
Some Ministry of Agriculture officials, however, have suggested that the UK
may be divided into up to 14 regions.
Should that turn out to be the case the odds are that the compensation for a
highly productive region like East Anglia would be increased, making
set-aside there more attractive. Conversely lower yielding regions would
receive less compensation.
There is so far no ruling, however, on the quality standards to be imposed
on grain that will be accepted into intervention stores. Rumour has it that
these standards may be made more stringent than in the past, thereby
limiting the quantities that will qualify for intervention buying and by
implication reducing the overall value of the new guaranteed price package.
It is not clear whether a farmer can opt to enter the new set-aside scheme
whenever he wishes during the three-year transitional period or whether he
must join from year one or not at all.
If participation from the start is required it may be necessary not to plant
15 per cent of winter wheat and winter barley in the coming autumn so that
it is not there to be harvested in 1993. Seed for that which is to be
planted will have to be ordered within the next few weeks, however, so it is
vital for farmers and the supply trade that the information on which to make
management decisions is made available.
There seems to be no definitive ruling as to whether the new set-aside
should be rotational, in other words on different fields each year, or
non-rotational, on the same land for a period of years. If it were allowed
to be static farmers would of course select their worst land to leave
uncropped every year. That would increase average yields harvested, but it
would also limit the effects of set-aside on overall production.
Summaries of the reform package that I have seen clearly state that non-food
crops may be grown on set-aside land. Does this mean a farmer can grow
linseed for oil, which is used in the manufacture of paint, and claim an
additional area payment for it under another unrelated EC scheme? I suspect
not but it is yet another example of the confusion that characterises this
reform package.
And I wonder how this complex production-reducing policy, which also
includes dairy and beef cattle as well as sheep, will ever be effectively
administered and policed across Europe. Only France within the EC, I
understand, has an up-to-date register of land and knowledge of who owns
what. In the UK farmers are required by the government to complete annual
returns giving individual crop area details and stocking levels. That
information must be on a Ministry of Agriculture computer somewhere.
Some EC member states, however, have no such information. How will they set
about introducing such complicated legislation? How will their farmers
respond to the mass of forms that they will be required to fill in to claim
their compensation? How can British farmers be sure that other countries'
governments will comply with the dictats of Brussels as assiduously as their
own?
Having witnessed for myself recently that Italy has not yet introduced milk
quotas eight years after they were supposed imposed across the EC I am
somewhat cynical as I look forward to this latest rash of rules. Meanwhile,
I have it on good authority that the British Ministry of Agriculture is
recruiting people to police its farmers as fast as it is able.

FT  09 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Turmoil eases as holiday calm settles
on the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN, SIMON LONDON and TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING the turmoil of last week's bond markets, calm descended on the
primary Eurobond market yesterday as holidays throughout much of continental
Europe precluded much activity.
The focus for the rest of the week is expected to fall on the US and
Canadian dollar markets, where sentiment has benefited from the poor
performance of most European bond markets following last week's rejection of
the Maastricht treaty by Denmark. Among European markets, the D-Mark and
Swiss franc sectors are looking in good shape.
Ontario Hydro's global bond offering, arranged by Merrill Lynch, Goldman
Sachs, Nomura and Wood Gundy, is likely to be launched later today. The
underwriting syndicate was assembled yesterday, and the maturity of the
transaction was set at 10 years. Initial soundings of investors point to a
size of more than Dollars 2bn, according to banks close to the transaction.
The offering may be added to Ontario's existing 10-year global bonds, or
structured as a separate deal. In either case, the launch spread over the
Canadian government yield curve is expected to be close to the 68 basis
point spread quoted yesterday on Ontario-Hydro's outstanding 8 5/8 per cent
global bonds due 2002.
In the dollar sector, the Asian Development Bank has mandated Goldman Sachs
to arrange a Dollars 500m 10-year deal. The bonds, which are expected to be
launched in the next week or so, are likely to be priced to yield 30 to 32
basis points above the 10-year US Treasury, according to dealers. Such a
level is comparable with the current spreads of deals for Japan's
Export-Import Bank and Japan Finance Corporation for Municipal Enterprises
(JFM). Goldman declined to comment on the timing and pricing of the
transaction.
Despite the absence of continental European investors, the decline of Ecu
bond prices continued. The French government's 10-year Ecu OAT fell  3/4
point to close at 96.80.
Bonds issued by Statni Banka, the Czechoslovakian central bank, wavered
slightly in the secondary market following gains made by Slovakian
nationalists in elections, writes Simon London.
The result was seen as increasing the chances of a split between the Czech
and Slovak republics or the development of a looser federation.
Statni Banka bonds were yesterday quoted at a yield spread of 300 basis
points over US Treasuries, from 285 basis points before the elections.
However, Nomura International, which lead-managed the Dollars 200m issue in
November last year, reported very little selling.
The covenants of the issue make it an event of default if Statni Banca
ceases to be the central bank of either republic.
REPSOL, the Spanish oil, gas and chemicals group, has again extended its
convertible bond issue. Initially set at Pta25bn, it was first extended to
Pta50bn and is now going up to Pta80bn, writes Tom Burns in Madrid.
The bonds were priced at Pta10,000 and investors were limited to buying a
maximum of 800 for Pta8m.
Bondholders can convert into shares in late September. Should they do so,
the state's shareholding in Repsol will be reduced, at current share prices,
by some 10 per cent to around 54 per cent.
Repsol is also planning to make an international placement of shares for
institutional investors after the September bond conversion.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Europe continues slide in high-yielding
paper

EUROPE'S higher-yielding government bond markets continued their slide
yesterday in the wake of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty. The
referendum result dashed investors' hopes of convergence in European
interest rates and led to a sharp drop in the high-yielding markets last
week.
Italy, which was once one of the more popular high-yielding European bond
markets, suffered a further setback on fears that the Bank of Italy may be
forced to raise interest rates in order to support the lira.
The emergency funds rate was raised by 50 basis points to 13 per cent last
week, and dealers said the market was worried that the central bank would
have to raise the discount rate from its current level of 12 per cent if the
currency comes under further pressure.
News that Moody's, the rating agency, has placed Italy's foreign currency
debt under review for possible downgrade also upset the bond market, dealers
said. The 12 per cent government bond due May 2002 fell in price from 96.40
at Friday's close to end at 95.50 yesterday. The futures contract fell from
its opening of 96.05 to close at 95.39.
Many of the European bond markets were closed yesterday for a public
holiday. However, dealers reported a continuation of last week's trend of
switching out of high-yielding markets into the safety of the D-Mark bloc
using the futures market. The Liffe bund futures contract rose from 88.06 to
88.21.
UK GILTS fell nearly half a percentage point as the market continued to
suffer from worries about convergence and the government's heavy funding
programme.
The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from Friday's close of 98.06 to open at
97.31, and ended the day at 97.22 on a volume of about 27,000 contracts. The
benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from Friday's close of 116
5/16 to trade at 115 7/8 by late afternoon.
JAPANESE government bonds ended the day mixed, with the futures contract and
long-dated issues closing lower while shorter-dated bonds finished the day
slightly firmer.
Dealers said the bond market opened on a firm note, helped by the stronger
yen and the release on Friday of slightly worse-than-expected jobs data in
the US for May. The figures raised hopes of a further easing in US monetary
policy and encouraged Japanese government bond prices to open stronger.
The benchmark No 129 issue opened with a yield of 5.465 per cent, moved to
5.455 per cent and fell on futures-driven selling to close at 5.505 per
cent. The futures contract, which opened at 102.07, reached a high of
102.09, then fell back to end the day at 101.75.
Dealers expect the market to trade in a narrow range ahead of the Bank of
Japan's quarterly survey of business sentiment - the Tankan - which is due
on Friday.
AFTER the excitement generated on Friday by an unexpectedly weak May
employment report, US Treasury markets settled down into a narrow trading
range yesterday as dealers and investors digested the implications of last
week's monthly jobs data.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  1/16 at 101
25/32 , yielding 7.838 per cent. Prices were firmer at the short end of the
market, with the two-year note up  1/8 at 100 3/32 , yielding 5.057 per
cent.
Late last week, prices gained on the unforeseen rise in the monthly
unemployment rate from 7.2 per cent to 7.5 per cent, which boosted hopes of
another policy ease by the Federal Reserve.
A closer study of the figures, however, revealed that labour market
conditions were mixed in May, and there was enough evidence of an
improvement in the employment situation in certain sectors to prevent the
market from adding substantially to Friday's gains.
By yesterday, the consensus appeared to be that while the May jobs data had
negative implications for the state of the economic recovery, they were not
bad enough to warrant an interest rate cut by the Fed.
Dealers and investors, therefore, were holding their fire, awaiting the next
set of economic numbers, which are due out later this week.
Thursday will see the publication of May retail sales and producer price
index figures, while on Friday details of May consumer prices and April
business inventories will be released.

HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank, one of the largest single creditors of Olympia &amp;
York, the troubled Canadian property developer, said its total exposure to
O&amp;Y was Dollars 787m, writes Simon Holberton in Hong Kong.
Hongkong Bank rebutted suggestions it was a large lender to the Canary Wharf
development in London, saying its exposure to that project was less than
Dollars 9m.
The bulk of its advance to O&amp;Y had arisen from its participation in a
Dollars 2.5bn syndicated loan to Olympia &amp; York Resources Credit Corp.
The syndicate effectively has a first charge over O&amp;Y's 71 per cent stake in
Gulf Canada Resources and 82 per cent interest in Abitibi-Price, pulp and
newsprint manufacturer.
The current 'loan-to-market value ratio' of these two assets was around 66
per cent, the bank said.
This suggests that Hongkong Bank may have to provide up to Dollars 270m if
the underlying assets were sold at current values.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANNOUNCEMENT by the South African Standard Bank group that it has
obtained a UK banking licence will not necessarily lead to a flood of
similar applications from other South African banks.
Although the banking community is enjoying the greater business freedom
allowed by the country's political rehabilitation, the new possibilities
this opens up are being assessed cautiously.
Mr Piet Badenhorst, chief executive of ABSA, South Africa's largest banking
group, is known to be of the view that obtaining a banking licence in London
is not a high priority.
An ABSA spokesman says London is a very crowded market, and also one
perceived as being heavily controlled by the status quo in the City.
He says an ABSA operation there is still some way off. The group's sheer
size, however, may hasten the process.
Mr Badenhorst said at a recent presentation that they were attracting new
corporate clients because of their size, and because corporations wanted to
spread their exposure. If these clients required an overseas service, ABSA
would clearly provide it.
Mr Viv Bartlett, senior general manager at First National Bank (FNB), said
they were examining options in relation to London and would be making a
decision 'in the not too distant future'.
He said the primary focus of offshore operations would be in assisting
corporate investors with their trade-flows and foreign exchange dealing
operations.
Mr Bartlett said obtaining a UK banking licence - the one issued to Standard
was the first to a South African bank since 1985 - should not be a problem.
'Since the political changes, the signals out of London have been that we
would be warmly received.'
Mr Bartlett said an application was being processed for an FNB branch in
Zurich, while they were submitting an application for a separate deposit
taking company licence in Hong Kong.
A disincentive to making a 'bricks and mortar' investment abroad is the high
cost because offshore purchases have to be financed through the financial
rand mechanism.
No Nedcor Bank spokesman was available for comment.

THE US SUPREME Court has ruled against an appeal by Eastman Kodak, the US

company's ability to control replacement parts and service on equipment it
manufactures, AP-DJ reports from Washington.
The justices, on a 6-3 vote, affirmed a federal appeals court ruling
reinstating an anti-trust lawsuit filed against Kodak in 1987 by 18
independent companies that repair Kodak copiers and printers.
They charged that Kodak had violated federal anti-trust law by refusing to
sell replacement parts to owners of Kodak equipment unless they agreed not
to do business with independent service companies. It was alleged that this
illegally tied the sale of one product to a separate condition or service.

FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: McGowan, MCI chairman and
telecom visionary, dies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM McGowan, chairman of MCI Communications and one of the most
important figures behind the revolutionary changes in the structure of the
US telecommunications industry over the past two decades, died yesterday in
Washington of a heart attack. He was 64.
Mr McGowan, a restless challenger of convention, came to the rescue of a
tiny, financially-ailing start-up company - then known as Microwave
Communications Incorporated - in 1968 and turned it into the second-largest
long-distance telephone company in the US.
Central to his success was the legal challenge he mounted to mighty American
Telephone &amp; Telegraph, which led in 1978 to a landmark court ruling breaking
AT&amp;T's monopoly of the long-distance telephone market.
Mr McGowan, who for most of his career was a chain-smoking workaholic,
suffered a serious heart attack in 1986. He underwent heart transplant
surgery the next year but returned to his desk after only a few months,
declaring 'it would be punishment not to work'.
However, in recent years he had steadily withdrawn from day-to-day
responsibilities at MCI and late last year he ceded his role as chief
executive to Mr Bert Roberts, MCI's president and his long-time heir
apparent. Mr Roberts is expected to be named chairman.
Wall Street analysts said Mr McGowan's death was likely to have little
impact on MCI's operations, in view of the careful devolution of power to Mr
Roberts.
However, they said the US telecommunications industry as a whole would
suffer from the loss of one of its most articulate and visionary spokesmen.
MCI's shares closed at Dollars 32 7/8 , up Dollars  5/8 on the Nasdaq
over-the-counter market.
Mr McGowan, a florid-faced man with a broad grin, was born into an Irish
immigrant family in Pennsylvania. His father was a railroad engineer and his
mother a teacher. After attending the Harvard Business School, he set up in
New York as a consultant rescuing troubled companies.
In 1968 he was invited to help rescue MCI, then based in Chicago, which
wanted to offer a radio telephone services to trucks travelling between that
city and St Louis.
The company needed approval for this service from the Federal Communications
Commission, which oversees the US telecommunications industry, but its
application was opposed by AT&amp;T, which had a virtual monopoly in the
long-distance market.
MCI eventually won FCC approval and Mr McGowan, having taken control of the
company after paying off its debts, got a taste for challenging AT&amp;T. It was
his particular genius to realise that a tightly run rival could undercut the
giant's prices and that AT&amp;T's heavy-handed approach to potential
competition made it vulnerable on anti-trust grounds.
Over the subsequent decade and a half, MCI constantly harried AT&amp;T before
regulatory agencies and in the courts, to the extent that the company
jokingly became known as ' a law firm with an antenna on the roof'.
Mr McGowan, aware that good relations with the FCC would be vital to his
crusade, quickly moved the company's headquarters to Washington, just around
the corner from the commission's offices.
Parallel with MCI's attacks on AT&amp;T, the Justice Department pursued the
giant on anti-trust grounds, and Mr McGowan's ultimate vindication came in
1984 when this suit led to the break-up of AT&amp;T and the spinning-off of its
local telephone services into seven separate 'Baby Bell' regional companies.
This created a much more level playing field for MCI and other independents,
such as Sprint, to compete against AT&amp;T in the long-distance market. A
bitter price war ensued, which helped the US consumer but in 1986
contributed to huge losses at MCI and heavy staff cuts.
MCI recovered, helped by innovative product introductions, and it is now
estimated to hold some 17 per cent of the long-distance market - although an
aggressive AT&amp;T has made it much harder for MCI to win further domestic
market share.

975m share buy-back

<TEXT>
GENERAL Dynamics, the US defence contractor which has been promising to
return its rapidly-mounting excess cash reserves to shareholders, yesterday
announced plans to spend up to Dollars 975m to buy back 30 per cent of its
stock.
The company said it would launch a so-called Dutch auction tender offer this
week for up to 13m shares. As part of the package, the Crown and Goodman
families, which own 22 per cent of General Dynamics' stock, intend to lower
their stake to around 15 per cent.
The share repurchase is the latest stage in a 'plan of contraction' by Mr
William Anders, the former air force pilot and astronaut who took over as
chairman of General Dynamics last year.
The company, which is being slimmed to four core defence businesses, is
selling off peripheral activities, including several commercial businesses
and its missiles division. It is sitting on Dollars 1.2bn of cash and
marketable securities.
Mr Anders said yesterday the company's cash resources 'far exceed those
needed to pursue opportunities within our core businesses and to keep them
strong and viable'. He believed the best way to invest a significant
proportion of the funds was in the repurchase of the company's stock.
The Dutch auction involves shareholders specifying a price not greater than
Dollars 75 a share and not less than Dollars 65. 3/8 (last Friday's close)
at which they would be willing to sell their shares.
The company would then decide the lowest price in that range which would
allow it to buy 13m shares, and then pay that price for all shares tendered
at or below the purchase price.
General Dynamics shares, which have risen from Dollars 25 1/4 at the start
of last year, rose sharply on the news to close at Dollars 71, up Dollars
5.625, on the New York Stock Exchange.
The company's management said it would not be in General Dynamics' best
interests for the Crown and Goodman stockholders to increase their stake in
the business.
The families' three representatives on the board shared this view, it said.
The Crown and Goodman families would have preferred to retain their current
stake, but for tax reasons would be tendering shares likely to cut their
holding to around 15 per cent.

NEW SENIOR management of Young Group officially takes charge of the coal
mining company following its annual meeting today, clearing the way for the
business to be refocused on its core activities, identified as opencast and
underground coal mining and haulage, with an eye to opportunities likely to
arise in British Coal's privatisation.
Mr Joseph Stevenson, recently appointed non-executive chairman-elect and Mr
Brian Calver, group managing director-elect, have started a review aimed at
overcoming working capital problems which led to the recent financial
restructuring, but have declined to state which non-core activities might be
sold.
The review has a 'certain urgency', said Mr Stevenson, as Young wants to
exploit privatisation opportunities.
After today's meeting Mr Bob Young, a miner's son, will cease to be chairman
and chief executive of the Durham-based company he founded in 1970. His
departure from the chair was agreed in April as part of a restructuring
which gave the group an additional Pounds 2.4m overdraft facility.
He will become non-executive vice chairman, advising on marketing strategy.

Steady sales growth and control of costs helped GWR Group, the independent
radio contractor, boost interim profits to Pounds 253,984 pre-tax.
The outcome of this USM-quoted group for the six months to end-March
compared with just Pounds 32,509 last time and was achieved on turnover
marginally ahead at Pounds 3.46m (Pounds 3.36m).
National and local advertising improved 15 per cent and 12 per cent
respectively over the previous, albeit depressed, half year reflecting,
according to Mr Henry Meakin, chairman, listening figures ahead by 15.8 per
cent.
Despite acquiring a 17 per cent stake in Classic FM, the first national
commercial classical music station which is due to be launched in the
autumn, and stakes in Minster Sound in York and Spire FM in Salisbury for a
total consideration in excess of Pounds 1m, gearing remains low at 15 per
cent.
The interim dividend jumps from 1p to 3p, payable from earnings of 5.7p
(0.7p) per share.

<TEXT>
PROTEAN, the water purification and laboratory equipment maker formerly Elga
Group, yesterday displayed the fruits of recent acquisitions with steep
rises in profits and turnover for the year to March 31.
Pre-tax profits increased 55 per cent from Pounds 1.31m to Pounds 2.03m. A
final dividend of 2.15p is proposed for a total of 2.75p (2.5p).
Mr Peter Ryan, chairman, said last year was one of great achievement.
Although profits were boosted by a first full-year contribution from
Chromacol, acquired in February 1991, all companies traded profitably
despite pressure on margins caused by the recession.
Two other acquisitions had less impact, coming towards the end of the
reporting period. Aquadem, the Paris-based water purification components
supplier was acquired in December. The purchase of Carbolite, a maker of
laboratory furnaces, was not completed until March.
Turnover rose to Pounds 22.7m (Pounds 16.5m), in line with the interim
figures, when sales were 37 per cent ahead at Pounds 9.6m (Pounds 7m) and
pre-tax profits increased 52 per cent to Pounds 462,000. Earnings were
affected by a higher tax charge and rose to 8.29p (8.05p).

FT  09 JUN 92 / RTZ to sell its stake in Canadian mining unit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RTZ, the world's biggest mining group, is selling its 51.5 per cent stake in
Rio Algom, a large Canadian mining and metals distribution subsidiary.
RTZ will earn Pounds 118m from the sale, after expenses and Canadian capital
gains tax. The book value of the stake is Pounds 148m, leading to an
extraordinary loss of Pounds 30m.
Rio Algom has gradually declined in its importance to the group. The
disposal allows RTZ to concentrate on its remaining North American
businesses, which were mainly acquired in 1989 from BP.
An RTZ spokesman said the sale would prevent possible conflicts of interest
between Rio Algom and RTZ's other North American businesses such as
Kennecott, its most profitable subsidiary.
Analysts welcomed the sale, saying Rio Algom had failed to match the group's
earnings growth in recent years. 'Its cash-cow uranium earnings have fallen
rapidly and will cease altogether in 1996,' according to Mr Alan Richards at
BZW.
The 22.51m shares are being placed with mainly Canadian institutions and
underwritten by Gordon Capital Corp, RBC Dominion Securities and Wood Gundy.
The placement price of CDollars 16.10 compared with Friday's closing price
of CDollars 16.25. Payment is due in three instalments over the next two
years.
RTZ approached at least two companies in recent months about selling the
stake as a block. But no purchaser would match the stock market value.
The apparently hasty disposal of the stake, which has fallen in value by
CDollars 129m (Pounds 59.10m) in the past year, prompted speculation RTZ is
preparing another move in Canada. 'Perhaps Kennecott will do something soon
which could conflict with Rio Algom,' said Mr Euan Worthington at SG
Warburg.
The sale is unlikely to alter RTZ's earnings for this year. In 1991 Rio
Algom contributed only Pounds 11m of RTZ's net attributable profits of
Pounds 308m. But RTZ's cashflow will be about Pounds 128m stronger,
representing the sale price and about Pounds 10m in notional deferred
interest on the instalment payments.
A Toronto-based analyst said Rio Algom had been limited by RTZ's investment
in Kennecott. The sale gives the Canadian company 'a better chance of
operating independently', he said.
Rio Algom is also expected to try again to sell its metals distribution
business, with a price close to book value of CDollars 200m.

Dollars 2.3bn (Pounds 1.3bn) cash-and-stock offer to acquire Gulf States
Utilities (GSU), a Texas-based utility, in an agreed takeover that could
help rationalise the electricity market in the region.
The terms of the deal - which would make the combined group one of the top
five utilities in the US - call for Entergy to offer up to Dollars 250m in
cash and the remaining Dollars 2.05bn in stock.
The takeover values GSU at Dollars 20 per share, representing a 38 per cent
premium over its closing price last Friday.
Yesterday the GSU share price rose by Dollars 1 1/4 , or 8.6 per cent, to
close at Dollars 15 3/4 . Entergy's share price declined by Dollars 1/8 to
Dollars 27.
Entergy is a large New Orleans-based utility serving more than 1.7m
customers in Arkansas, Louisiana and Mississippi. The company, which employs
12,500 people, made a Dollars 482m net profit last year on Dollars 4bn of
revenues. GSU of Beaumont, Texas, is a smaller utility with 579,000
customers in south-east Texas and southern Louisiana. Its 1991 net profit
was Dollars 102m on revenues of Dollars 1.7bn. GSU has 4,500 employees.
The deal may be seen as a resolution of GSU's long-standing woes. The
company invested about Dollars 3bn in the 1980s in a 1,000MW nuclear power
plant in Louisiana, but said yesterday it was only earning a return on about
half the investment because of a lack of customer demand.
Analysts said yesterday the merger seemed promising. But they warned
approval could be lengthy. Entergy said yesterday it would raise the price
of the transaction if it had not been completed by June 1994.
Mr Edwin Lupberger, chairman of Entergy, said the deal would create a more
competitive and efficient company and would lead to fuel-cost savings,
operational advantages and cost efficiencies.
Mr Edward Tirello, an analyst at Smith Barney Harris Upham, said GSU had
faced threats from competition in the past. 'By going with Entergy, a larger
company with a more diverse fuel base, they will be able to lower prices to
keep their industrial customers, such as the petrochemical and oil refining
business,' he said.
Salomon Brothers is advising Entergy. GSU's adviser is Goldman Sachs.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Hanson's US arm goes back to basics: Why the group wants to
convince investors that it does more than buy and sell companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT has been a painful and frustrating period for Mr David Clarke and Mr John
Raos, respectively chief executive and chief operating officer of Hanson
Industries, the US arm of Hanson.
They have had to watch from the sidelines as Hanson engaged in a phoney war
with Imperial Chemical Industries, and its share price significantly
underperformed the FT-SE 100 index. And they have had to live with bad
publicity after Hanson's flotation of a majority stake in Smith Corona, the
typewriter company, was followed by a collapse in its share price and a
blizzard of shareholder lawsuits.
Now, the two plan to regain centre stage, as the news that Hanson is again
considering floating majority stakes in its US non-core businesses
indicates.
Behind that process is some simple arithmetic. If investors priced Hanson's
shares by looking at the US market's average prospective price/earnings
ratio of 17, rather than the UK's 13, the stock would look a lot healthier.
The mooted US flotations are a way of tapping those higher American
valuations.
At one point, serious thought was given to floating or spinning off the
entire US business, which contributed 60 per cent of Hanson's Pounds 1.3bn
pre-tax profits for the year to September 30.
'In the end,' says Mr Clarke, 'it was never proven to be advantageous
because unbundling the US businesses would have increased the tax bill,
which in turn would be dilutive to earnings.' Instead, he decided to refocus
Hanson's strategy. He hopes to persuade US investors that Hanson is no
longer just a strategic buyer and seller of companies but a manager of seven
core businesses.
Significantly, five of them are based in the US: Peabody Coal; Cavenham
Forest; the aggregates company Beazer USA; Grove Industries, the largest
hydraulic crane manufacturer in the world; and SCM Chemical. Two are
UK-based: Imperial Tobacco; and the Hanson building products operations,
which now include ARC and London Brick.
Hanson plans to expand its core businesses through 'bolt-on' acquisitions.
Mr Mark Alexander, who leads Hanson's merger and acquisition team in the US,
says: 'We are focusing primarily on our core businesses, which is why our
bolt-on activity has dramatically increased.'
Hanson still retains its opportunistic streak. For example, it is looking
hard at Canary Wharf, the London office development owned by Canada's
Olympia &amp; York, now in insolvency proceedings.
But if Hanson acquires a bargain unrelated to any of the group's existing
big businesses, the Clarke strategy calls for it to become a new core
business - in Canary Wharf's case, by merging it with the group's extensive
property portfolio in the US.
Outside the core is a raft of smaller companies, which Hanson refers to as
portfolio businesses. Under the Clarke plan, those that cannot be expanded
will be sold off, raising perhaps Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m).
The way became clear for Hanson to float off some of these smaller companies
on US stock markets seven months ago, when Smith Corona settled the
shareholders' lawsuit against it over its flotation in 1989. The total
settlement was Dollars 24m, of which Smith Corona contributed Dollars 5m.
It is easy to see why shareholders were angry. When Hanson sold 52 per cent
of Smith Corona to the US public in July 1989, it obtained Dollars 21 a
share. Not long after the sale, with Japanese competition increasing and the
dividend cut, Smith Corona's share price collapsed to less than Dollars 5.
(It was yesterday trading at about Dollars 9.)
Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, believes there is a simple lesson
to be learnt from the Smith Corona experience. 'The flotation price was
pitched too high,' he says, 'while the business was severely affected by
Japanese companies dumping on us.'
The market will bear those words in mind as it contemplates the possible
candidates for flotation.
Hanson Industries has arranged them into four groups:
Housebuilding, including Beazer's US housebuilding interests and MW (which
produces interior moulding for windows);
Consumer products, including Tommy Armour (golf clubs), Farberware
(cookware), Ames (lawn, garden and industrial hardware) and Rexair (vacuum
cleaners);
Recreation and leisure, including Irte Toys and Valley (pool tables and
electronic dart games);
Jacuzzi, the whirlpool bath manufacturer, which is considered big enough to
stand alone.
Hanson would keep a small stake in all the possible flotations.
If the US stock market unexpectedly falls out of bed, Lord White says,
Hanson will quickly shelve the possible flotations and look for strategic
buyers.
But unless or until that happens, the overheated US market for initial
public offerings has been performing in line with a stock-promoter's wildest
dreams. One recent example is Royal Appliance Manufacturers, which makes the
'dirt devil' vacuum cleaner. It came to market in August 1991 at Dollars
15.50 a share; rose to Dollars 64; and is now around Dollars 40. With luck,
such stories will make US investors forget Smith Corona.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Czech and Slovak leaders in key talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Foreign Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of Czechoslovakia was last night in the hands of the country's
two political king-pins, prime minister-designate Vaclav Klaus and the main
Slovak leader Vladimir Meciar. The two men met yesterday for crucial talks
which could decide whether their country splits apart.
Mr Klaus, whose rightwing Civic Democratic party won most votes in the Czech
republic in last weekend's election, wants to retain a strong Czechoslovak
federation and push through radical economic reforms. Mr Meciar, election
victor in Slovakia, is keen to loosen ties with Prague and slow down
reforms. Yesterday, the two met half-way between Prague and the Slovak
capital Bratislava. Talks continue today.
As leaders of the two strongest parties, Mr Klaus and Mr Meciar must
establish a working relationship if Czechoslovakia's two deeply-divided
parts are to remain together. The talks between the two will centre on the
form of the future federal government and the division of power between
Czechs and Slovaks within it.
Mr Klaus has said he will reduce the federal government to a few key
ministries - such as finance, economics, foreign affairs and defence - but
this may lead to clashes with Slovaks, who want their republic freed from
federal control.
Mr Klaus has said that fiscal and economic policy must remain unified, but
Slovak nationalists want two central banks and full control of the
privatisation programme in their republic.
After his election triumph, Mr Meciar said he would oppose President Vaclav
Havel when members of parliament vote in a presidential election next month.
He said Mr Havel's chances of re-election were now minimal.
President Havel, whose immense personal authority makes him the main
unifying force in Czechoslovakia, will pull out of the election if the
country heads for a split and political and economic reforms are
jeopardised.
Mr Meciar held talks earlier yesterday with the leaders of the two next
strongest Slovak parties in an attempt to form a regional government
coalition. Mr Meciar favours two strong republics - the Czech lands and
Slovakia - which would conclude a treaty and only then agree to concede some
powers to a central federal government.
This attitude is unacceptable to many Czech politicians who claim it would
effectively break up Czechoslovakia, born 74 years ago from the ashes of the
Austro-Hungarian Empire.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Former Soviet states accused of cultivating illegal drugs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 3m acres of mari-juana are being illegally cultivated in the
former Soviet Union, together with about 100,000 poppy fields in Russia
alone, according to a report produced by a United Nations fact-finding
mission.
The UN Drug Control Programme in Vienna, which has been investigating how to
help contain the problem, has also disclosed that a special aerial survey is
being carried out this month to check whether opium poppies have been
secretly sown in the contaminated area around Chernobyl. The poppies should
be starting to flower about now.
The mission says Russia's 'frantic race for capitalism' and its efforts to
make the rouble convertible will provide 'propitious terrain' for money
laundering.
In addition, newly opened borders are not being effectively controlled, so
that new routes are appearing which can be used for exporting drugs to
western Europe.
Some traffic has already been diverted from the increasingly better-policed
Balkan route to one through the Caucasus.
The mission, led by Mr Enrique Parejo-Gonzalez of the UN agency, included Mr
Robert Simmonds, former commissioner of the Royal Canadian Mounted Police,
and Dr Istvan Beyer, former director-general of the Hungarian National
Institute of Pharmacy.
Their report says the drug abuse problem in the countries of the former
Soviet Union 'is bound to develop exponentially in the near future', as
illegal supplies are pushed to fuel local demand.
The report warns that 'all the ingredients' for a drug abuse problem are
there: 'Unemployment, poverty, a phase during which freedom is carried to an
extreme, fascination with western modes of life, the appearance of new drugs
and 'business' in all its forms, which will encourage new dealers and
encourage proselytism.'
The report urges technical help and advice so that new governments can fight
the problems more effectively.
This includes better links with international drug control bodies, new
anti-drug laws to fill the legal vacuum in most republics, rehabilitation of
addicts, and laboratories and equipment to help catch traffickers.
All the new governments are taking the problem seriously but knowledge of
its extent is imperfect in the present phase of political and economic
upheaval, the report says.
New facts uncovered in the visit included 350,000 acres in Kazakhstan and
150,000 acres Kyrgyzstan where marijuana is growing wild.
This is used locally or exported and the authorities said it was impossible
to control or eradicate totally.
In Uzbekistan, poppies are being grown in mountainous regions but police
lack equipment to destroy the fields. The report says the same problem
occurs in Russia, where there are now an estimated 100,000 poppy fields or
plots and nearly 2.5m acres of marijuana under cultivation.
'The situation is similar in Belarus, particularly in the region near
Chernobyl, in Ukraine and in Tajikistan,' the report adds.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Nadir theft charges rejected: Former Polly Peck chief faces
20 further counts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HIGH COURT judge yesterday dismissed 46 charges of theft, involving Pounds
119.5m, against Mr Asil Nadir, former chairman of Polly Peck International,
the collapsed fruit to electronics group.
Mr Nadir, who was present at the hearing at Birmingham Crown Court, still
faces a further 20 charges of theft and false accounting, involving some
Pounds 30m.
After the hearing, his solicitor, Mr Peter Lakin of Pannone March Pearson,
the Manchester law firm, said Mr Nadir was delighted by the outcome.
'This is one of the best Monday mornings we have had for some time,' Mr
Lakin said.
Last night, the Serious Fraud Office, which brought the charges, said it was
considering its position.
Whether the charges were reinstated at a later date would depend on an
appeal in another case on a similar point, a spokeswoman said. That case is
due to be heard by the Law Lords in July.
Yesterday's decision followed an application by Mr Nadir last month to have
charges under section 1 of the Theft Act 1968 dismissed.
The charges alleged theft by transfer of funds from PPI's bank accounts to
the account of a wholly owned subsidiary, Unipac, held at the National
Westminster Bank in Jersey, or to the Midland International account of the
Industrial Bank of Kibris, a bank in Northern Cyprus owned by Mr Nadir.
Mr Anthony Scrivener QC for Mr Nadir said there was no evidence of any
'appropriation' of the funds as required under the terms of the Theft Act.
He said there was no assumption by Mr Nadir of PPI's rights because, in
transferring the assets to other bank accounts, Mr Nadir was doing something
he was authorised to do.
Mr Justice Tucker, the judge assigned to Mr Nadir's case, said there was no
doubt that Mr Nadir was authorised by PPI to make transfers.
However, the question was whether this authorisation was subject to the
proviso that transfers had to be for the legitimate business purposes of
PPI. The prosecution alleged Mr Nadir had no authority to transfer assets
other than for legitimate business purposes and that the transfers to Unipac
and IBK were fraudulent and dishonest.
They alleged that Unipac and IBK were used as conduits for Mr Nadir's
personal objectives.
The judge said the prosecution's argument entailed the proposition that if
Mr Nadir had changed his mind after transferring the assets and had applied
them for the company's proper purposes he would still - his initial
dishonest intention having been proved - have been guilty of theft.
But that could not be right, the judge said. The transfers were merely
preparatory acts.
'I take the view that no appropriation (or more accurately,
misappropriation) took place when the defendant transferred the sums of
money from the PPI bank account to the accounts of Unipac and IBK.
'But there is clear prima facie evidence that the withdrawal of assets from
the Unipac and IBK accounts immediately afterwards was unauthorised and that
there was an appropriation at that stage,' he said.
The judge added that the wording of the charges might have been enough to
cover this situation, but it was clear that the prosecution intended them to
cover only the early stage of the transactions.
Mr Nadir's trial is not expected to begin before March next year.

FT  09 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Capital adequacy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The vexed issue of monetary union aside, today's meeting of European
Community Finance Ministers will be even more fraught than usual. For the UK
in particular, the debate on capital adequacy standards for securities
houses represents a challenge of the sort relished by a certain baroness
when prime minister. If a German-led proposal is adopted, securities houses
will be subjected to the same rigorous capital standards as banks, despite
the gulf separating their activities.
The result for much of London's broking and underwriting houses would be
nasty. Many brokers could no longer afford to do business. The Euromarket
would face constraints on underwriting severe enough to drive public sector
borrowers away. The precise effect on the UK's invisible earnings is
impossible to calculate, but the direction is all too clear. The question is
whether the UK government should seek merely to water down the proposals or
to sidetrack them entirely.
The latter would be preferable. There are plenty of existing rules designed
to protect investors against brokers going bust. Moreover, the Basle
committee on banking supervision and the International Organisation of
Securities Commissions have been working jointly in this very area for
months. Arguably they are better placed than the Commission to produce
guidelines which are sympathetic to different securities markets' practices,
if only because they are openly consulting the various participants.
In practice, it looks as if the UK government will endorse a compromise
which pays lip service to national differences but leaves the principle of
tougher capital adequacy standards intact. That looks an unnecessarily risky
trade.

FT  09 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: UK pensions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Besides a Pounds 2.5m rescue scheme for Maxwell pensioners, the government
yesterday agreed to implement legislation ensuring that any deficiency in a
wound-up pension fund becomes a debt on the employer company. Industry
experts had previously expected Ministers to delay this provision of the
1990 Social Security Act on the grounds that the issue of equal pension
benefits for men and women remains unresolved, and that calculating a final
deficiency therefore is impossible at this stage. The equal pensions point
was specifically addressed in the Maastricht Treaty, but given recent events
may now not be resolved in the European Court until next year.
Mr Lilley's gesture is not to be sniffed at. But there is arguably no great
comfort anyway for pensioners in ranking alongside ordinary trade creditors,
who seldom get much in a liquidation. The alternative would have been
preferential status; and that, no doubt, would have been too much for the
banks.

FT  09 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: BAA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA has clearly set out to prove that there are other ways of investing in
the air transport business than buying British Airways. The airports
operator has outperformed BA by 75 per cent since flotation and yesterday
produced full year figures which will do little to dim the enthusiasm of its
fans. A 22 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, after all, had long been
expected in the wake of the Gulf war and the recession. What stood out in
the results, though, was the comfortable absorption of unexpectedly high
property provisions, the depth of the cost cutting and a marginally more
generous dividend than hoped for. The task of valuing BAA is complicated by
the lack of comparative stocks. Last night's price of 679p represents a 5
per cent to 10 per cent premium on the market's forward earnings multiple.
Productivity savings and traffic growth should offset the impact of a
tougher regulatory regime this year and next. Whether the company can do
better than the market depends on whether more optimistic forecasts for
volume growth are justified. There-after, however, pricing pressure on
airport charges starts to ease and retailing revenue will be building up.
BAA, moreover, is now in the enviable position of having very little
regulatory risk. The next review is almost 5 years away. Were the CAA to
contemplate getting tough, the threat used so successfully this time of
abandoning Heathrow's Terminal 5 might still be credible. But the more
profitable BAA becomes, the more seriously a future government would have to
consider bringing competition into the airports business. Hiving off Gatwick
would not work; but separating the ownership of terminals at Heathrow might
do the trick.

FT  09 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Maxwell in context
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The terms of reference of the Mirror Group investigation make it clear that
yet another full-blown City scandal is on the horizon. The simple approach
would have been to confine the inquiry to the exploits of Mr Maxwell
himself. By choosing rather to concentrate on the MGN flotation, the
inspectors will also bring on the full cast of bankers, brokers, lawyers and
accountants who made it all possible.
While the specific grounds for the investigation are not yet clear, three
areas suggest themselves. First, the prospectus itself. Did it contain
sufficient warning of the threat to the pension fund? It did make clear - if
only in the small print - that the fund was controlled and largely managed
by Maxwell companies. It also stated that the fund had not been audited for
over a year, which presumably covers the advisers against any looting which
may have gone on close to the flotation. A further crucial question is
whether the balance sheet and profit and loss account presented a true and
fair view. Given Mr Maxwell's record, that is perhaps a matter best left to
the inspectors.
The other two areas concern share price manipulation, not only of Maxwell
Communication ahead of the MGN float but also possibly of MGN itself
immediately after it. This is a particularly murky area, in which a number
of City reputations are at risk. However it all turns out, there is a
piquancy in the means of investigation. Up to the last, Mr Maxwell bitterly
attacked the system of DTI reporting which led to him being famously damned
in 1971. It was, he said, a form of business murder which he was unique in
having survived. Yesterday's announcement means the system can now revisit a
tireless opponent without fear of contradiction.

Sir, With companies removing management layers, and political devolution

<TEXT>
Sir, The furore raised in the media about the negative Danish vote on the
Maastricht Treaty is difficult to understand. With regard to the most
important part of the treaty, it could hardly have been anticipated, even if
ratification by all member states were assured, that convergence of economic
performance would have permitted their inclusion in the initial EMU which is
likely to be formed by 1997.
It is to be remembered that four convergence criteria have to be satisfied
(Article 109 of the Treaty).
On this basis, the likelihood of Greece, Italy and Portugal qualifying seems
remote, and given the Belgian public debt of well over 100 per cent of GDP,
its prospects as a partner are not exactly brilliant, despite the Belgian
government's urging that the Maastricht timetable be respected.
If, therefore, Denmark stands on the sidelines for the time being as far as
the Maastricht economic proposals are concerned, it will not be alone and
the 'variable geometry' factor will be present whether that particular
country is in or out.

Sir, Rejecting European integration would be the worst economic disaster to
befall Ireland since the 1847 famine. But I deplore the rush to ignore the
Danish decision. Now that the Danes have inflicted a mortal legal blow to
Maastricht, the other member states have an opportunity to go back to the
drawing board and devise a loose bureaucratic system.
The EC leaders should heed concerns about the lack of democratic control
over EC decision-making, especially in regard to the eminence grise role
played by the Brussels Commission.
As a former Commission spokesman on agriculture, I am still amazed at the
inefficiency and lack of accountability which I observed at first hand. Nor
do I have much regard for the authoritarian approach of Mr Jacques Delors. I
also have grave doubts about the Commission's capacity to take on new
responsibilities under the Maastricht Treaty when it so badly manages its
present role.
The choice between EC mammon and democrat supervision of the EC institutions
is a real dilemma for many like myself in the Irish Maastricht referendum on
June 18. The over-reliance by Prime Minister Albert Reynolds on the economic
argument for an Irish yes vote, however valid in itself, does not do justice
to the other factors which need to be taken into account. One of these may
be a Perot factor.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Clear thinking is now needed. Of course the 11 can press firmly ahead.
Denmark can go its own way, if it wants, and pay the price. But we should
look further.
The reality of European integration, taken one step further by Maastricht,
reflects our practical needs, to solve at a European level problems that
cannot be adequately dealt with by nation states. That includes most of our
economic framework, hence the strong push from single market to single
economic and monetary system.
But the perception of the ordinary voter, not only in Denmark, is quite
different. The ordinary voter believes that unelected bureaucrats are
forcing nonsense down his/her throat. The lesson from Denmark is that
current procedures are not acceptable and the flow of information between
voters and the centre is inadequate. Europe is wrestling with complex and
important issues, and voters are entitled to a political system that deals
with the issues and takes the decisions under democratic control. What is
needed is to strengthen the political centre, not weaken it.
Even before the Danish vote political reinforcement was urgently needed,
because of the drive to monetary union, enlargement and a more coherent
foreign policy. Questions covering the relationships between Council,
Commission, and European and national parliaments, as well as their internal
workings, cannot be set aside to 1996, nor settled by secret negotiation.
May I suggest we need much earlier a large and open conference designed to
arouse and react to public opinion, focused on this very clear theme: 'We
are building a new Europe, it is our only sensible hope for the future,
isn't it time we decided properly how we are going to manage it?'

Not all public relations material is utterly useless. London design company
Davies Baron has come up with a clever means of self-promotion. It has sent
Observer its lavishly produced slim volume of 12 pithy quotes on Europe, in
this year of European single-marketedness.
The playwright Tennessee Williams is there: 'That Europe's nothing on earth
but a great big auction, that's all it is' - along with the equally robust
DH Lawrence: 'One realises with horror, that the race of men is almost
extinct in Europe. Only Christ-like heroes and women-worshipping Don Juans
and rabid equality mongrels.'
Yet it must surely be scraping the barrel to quote Senator Schall 'of
Minnesota', who apparently said in 1953: 'To hell with Europe'. Davies Baron
could easily have got a similar view from any number of more memorable,
contemporary government figures.

If Rupert Murdoch's men really are intent on bringing down Britain's monarch
they have certainly done their homework. The Times' timely wall chart
celebrating the 350th anniversary of Britain's civil war shows an unusually
sharp attention to detail.
It puts the number of people killed at 84,738, and another 117,534 were
taken prisoner. There is also a big puff for John Pym, King Charles' number
one enemy in Parliament, whom the Times describes as a 'man of genius'.
Could this be any relation to John Pym, text editor of yesterday's wall
chart?

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A two way trade in senior managers seems to be developing between newspaper
tycoons Conrad Black and Rupert Murdoch. Black, who was most upset when
Murdoch pinched Andrew Knight from the Daily Telegraph, has now got his own
back by poaching one of Murdoch's rising stars to help lead his invasion of
Murdoch's home market.
Australian Michael Hoy, who won his spurs in the Murdoch empire as a tough
managing editor of The Times, is joining the Conrad Black consortium which
recently took over Fairfax, owners of the Sydney Morning Herald, the
(Melbourne) Age and the Australian Financial Review. The 42-year-old Hoy,
has been lured away from Murdoch's South China Morning Post after just seven
months as general manager, to be editorial director and deputy
chief-executive of Fairfax.
Meanwhile, it sounds as if Black is close to finding a chief executive for
the rudderless Fairfax. The word is that Phil Scanlan, chairman of the
Sydney Institute, a free market think tank, is the frontrunner. A right-wing
radical, Scanlan's views are likely to appeal to Black, if not to the
journalists who dominate the Fairfax publications.

True, the group is no longer on the brink of collapse following its

simply be that his wife is expecting their first child. Perhaps Wednesday's

Betterware proudly boasts that its trees will grow in 'a managed forest' in

Juan Antonio Samaranch, the most powerful man in international sport, should
be enjoying his twilight years as president of the International Olympic
Committee. But the run-up to the summer Olympics in his home town of
Barcelona has been marred by unpleasant criticism.
The publication of a critical book, Lords of the Rings, and a couple of
Granada TV documentaries, have thrown into question Samaranch's stewardship
of the Olympic ideal. So yesterday, Samaranch came to London to face his
Anglo-Saxon critics who want to unseat him. The occasion was the launch of
David Miller's official biography: Olympic Revolution, which had been rushed
out to counter-balance the charges made by Lords of the Rings.
Samaranch did not come alone. He was flanked on the stage by three IOC
members, the IOC director-general and Sir Arthur Gold, chairman of the
British Athletics Association.
As an accomplished ex-ambassador, the president knows how to be diplomatic
in the face of hostile questioning, especially on the subject of his future.
A lot of people have been putting pressure on him both to stay and to go,
but, teasingly, he says he will wait until after Barcelona to make up his
mind. The ring-master remains in complete control of the Olympic circus.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the success of last year's 'Music for Life' day on the South Bank, the
Aids fundraising body Crusaid organised another such jamboree last Sunday.
Throughout the morning and afternoon musicians were doing their thing on a
voluntary basis: many and varied things, including Judith Weir's mini-opera
The Small Moments (In Life) in the Royal Festival Hall ballroom, a
performance in the Elizabeth Hall by an ensemble of six pianos (Piano
Circus), and a staging in the Festival Hall by the Finchley Children's Music
Group of Britten's church opera Noyes Fludde.
The day had a glowing gala resolution in the form of an evening recital by
Montserrat Caballe and her fine pianist Manuel Burgueras at the Royal Opera
House.
The soprano was a friend and unlikely artistic partner of the late Freddie
Mercury; thus her contribution to Aids fundraising here and elsewhere has
personal poignancy. She offered one of her familiar chronological (or near
enough) programmes, starting in High Baroque, ending in the demotic style of
the zarzuela, and the whole sequence laced with theatricality and camp
appeal.
Her three Vivaldi arias immediately assured us that the voice was in
powerful shape, as doughtily heroic as meticulously controlled; grandly
assertive and, if never exactly delicate, capable of wonderfully precise
focus. The wife's complaint 'Sposa, son disprezza' (from Bajazet) had
passionate purity of line as well as pure passion of utterance.
Caballe is to lead the Royal Opera's new production of Rossini's Il viaggio
a Reims in July (celebrating the 20th anniversary of her house debut), and
her Sunday selection of Rossiniana displayed her characteristic gift, not
much dimmed by age, for hard coloratura brilliance and the ringing, knowing
top.
She has never perhaps been the most beguiling and simply seductive of
singers, and one missed the note of unaffected sentiment in her Massenet
songs and, more surprisingly, the touching Andalucian intensity of Turina's
'Cancion de cuna'.
Sometimes one felt that delicacy and pathos for Ms Caballe are mere
diminution of force rather than mettlesome qualities in their own right.
But she made the subtle patter of the zarzuela song, 'Marinela', absolutely
captivating, and as an encore rendered Puccini's brief 'O mio bambino caro'
with plausible pathos if not first freshness. She turned a longer Massenet
encore into a finale of astonishing stamina and flair.
One more encore, then the house came tumbling down, and everyone rose to his
feet.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Arts: After communism in Hungary - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK LIPSIUS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Budapest, two impresarios meet on a cloth-draped stage to negotiate a
change of management for the bankrupt theatre in a spoken preface to the
Erkel Theatre's new production of Orpheus in the Underworld.
In the third act, the misplaced wanderer in hell mixes his drunken panegyric
to sexual prowess with snide comments about the limp minister of finance.
Thus has the once ear-straining subtlety of anti-government innuendo in
Hungary given way to blatant invective, as the conservative coalition
proposes a parliamentary bill to impose more 'responsibility' on the
outspoken Press.
Even more telling are the sheer exuberance, stylishness and sexuality of
Viktor Nagy's production, a stark contrast to a drab seriousness of the
theatre under the Communists. Attila Csikos's sets evoke the playfulness of
an Olympus revelling in its excesses, led by Bela Kartza's winking Jupiter.
Hades has never been decked out more fittingly as a fin-de-siecle brothel.
The final scene's can-can for the gods may not have been as shocking as in
Offenbach's own first production in Paris, but it marked a departure from
the recent past in Budapest.
Budapest's internationally celebrated Katona Jozsef Theatre, fresh from a
visit to Australia, finds new richness in the naturalism of Chekhov's
Platonov. A production ten years ago at the nearby Jozsef Attila Theatre
plunged into the dark recesses of Chekhov's youthful imagination; this one
has a much more off-handed air, breezily placed among the comfortable
Russian bourgeoisie enjoying a holiday. Director Tamas Ascher makes the
servants clumsily open a deck chair and foolishly wander the room to further
mock the old regime.
A six-year-old production of Gyorgy Spiro's Chickenhead at the same theatre
is a reminder of what used to pass for realism: squalid public housing
victimised by juvenile delinquents, a pair of inarticulate toughs themselves
victims of welfare indifference and cruelty. With a pair of comic cops to
round out the picture, Gabor Zsambeki's production veers from the
oppressive-realist to the absurd, capped with a violent climax to round out
a perfect reminder of what passed for civil disobedience in the old days.
Appropriate as these productions seemed to post-Communist Hungary, they gave
as deceptive a view of the new order as the country's optimistic economic
figures. What in the old regime was stodgy and simple has become
fundamentally unstable despite a patina of exuberance and refreshing
frankness.
The immediate danger to Budapest theatre is financial: the national
government has turned the vast majority of theatres over to the city
council, retaining only the National Theatre and Opera.
As part of the National Opera, the Erkel shows how much national support can
mean. But even here, Orpheus may be one of only three new productions this
year, compared to a dozen in years past.

<TEXT>
George Bull, (left) who has piloted Grand Metropolitan's drinks business,
International Distillers and Vintners (IDV,) as it grew into the world's
largest wines and spirits company, is now moving to head GrandMet's
expanding food operations.
This follows the promotion earlier this year of Ian Martin, who led the
acquisition and integration of the US Pillsbury food operations, to group
managing director and chief operating officer, under Sir Allen Sheppard,
chairman and group chief executive.
Bull, 55, will take over as chairman and chief executive of the food sector
 -which includes Pillsbury flour and baking products, Green Giant vegetables
and Haagen-Dazs ice cream - on July 15. His task will be to build the
business, through acquisitions and joint ventures where possible, to match
the scale of the drinks operations. The food sector contributed Pounds 300m
in trading profits last year compared with IDV's Pounds 454m.
Joining one of the founding IDV companies in 1957, Bull held a series of
posts in the business before becoming chief executive in 1984. The company's
volume sales are now the largest in the world - more than 96m cases of wines
and spirits a year, including brands such as Smirnoff vodka and J &amp; B Rare
Scotch whisky. It has achieved 25 per cent compound growth in trading
profits over the past five years.
John McGrath, 53, (right) who became managing director and chief operating
officer of IDV last year, will succeed Bull as chief executive and joins
GrandMet's board immediately. He came to GrandMet from Compair in 1985 and
headed the group's brewing operations until the pubs-for-breweries swap with
Courage.
He was responsible for the reorganisation last year of IDV's international
business into four geographic regions.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): All change for recovery -
Business support organisations and the government are striving to create a
more streamlined and effective network
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The 1980s was a decade of rapid upheaval for small businesses in Britain.
The 1990s look likely to see an equally fundamental shake-up of the
organisations that support business; the chambers of commerce and of trade,
the enterprise agencies and the most recent arrivals, the Training and
Enterprise Councils (Tecs).
Change is being driven by a rethink of government attitudes; by the
recession which has cut a swathe through the membership rolls of many
groups; and by a realisation that business support must become more
professional.
It also reflects the limited number of people capable of running the
voluntary business agencies. Experienced individuals often find themselves
sitting on the board of their chamber of commerce as well as playing a role
at their local Tec.
An important catalyst for change was the launch, three years ago, of the
nationwide network of 82 Training and Enterprise Councils to provide
training and small business support on a local basis.
Uncertainty persists over just how well the Tecs will adapt to the
enterprise part of their brief but there is no doubt that they have
succeeded in galvanising existing organisations into improving their level
of service. The Association of British Chambers of Commerce (ABCC), whose
chambers represent 83,000 businesses, is 18 months into an ambitious
programme to boost membership and the quality of service that chambers
provide.
Evidence of the success of this policy, and of the pressures of the
recession, came last week with news that the National Chamber of Trade,
representing chambers and trade associations with a total of 150,000
members, is seeking a merger with the ABCC. The two, which have been rivals
for more than 90 years, hope to complete their merger talks in the autumn.
A merger of the two chamber organisations would significantly reduce the
fragmentation of small business support networks. But it would still leave
the chambers and Tecs uneasily vying for market share in some parts of the
country. The two organisations have held talks about closer co-operation
though it is unclear whether this might ultimately lead to mergers.
Earlier this year, it looked as though the business support picture was
going to become even more confused with the announcement of a plan for a
network of business clubs.
Tom Moffat, founder and chairman of the Durham Small Business Club, had
hoped that his network would become operational in April with 20 members,
but it is taking longer to get started. He now hopes to launch it with a
dozen members towards the end of the year.
Moffat maintained from the outset that his clubs would form part of a
three-tier network, sandwiched between the enterprise agencies and the
chambers of commerce. The proposed chambers' merger has prompted Moffat to
suggest to the ABCC that the two organisations devise a joint strategy.
While the chambers and business clubs try for strength through unity, the
300-plus enterprise agencies are faced with the need to create a new
national organisation from scratch. Business in the Community, which has
acted as an umbrella organisation for the agencies over the past 10 years,
is working on plans to end this special relationship.
In future BITC intends to provide backing on a more even-handed basis to the
whole range of business support organisations including the Tecs and the
chambers.
Quite what sort of national organisation will emerge to take on the role of
BITC in co-ordinating support for the agencies and representing their views
to government is unclear. It is not inconceivable that the agencies may
establish links with the Tecs or the chambers.
But whatever the business groups themselves decide, an important role will
be played by the government. Previous government involvement has appeared ad
hoc and unfocused and the creation of the Tecs angered some of the existing
business groups which felt they should have become the channels for
government action.
Michael Heseltine, whose trade and industry department has taken over
responsibility for small firms policy from the department of employment, is
known to be more interventionist in his approach, though it is not yet clear
what this means in practical terms.
There have been signs recently that the government has become willing to use
existing business networks. It is employing enterprise agencies to run five
pilot schemes to encourage private individuals - 'business angels' - to
invest in business. It also plans to use trade associations for three test
schemes on how to tackle the late payment of debt. If government and the
business organisations can make the right choices, then Britain will have a
more streamlined and more effective network of business support by the end
of the decade. If the chances are missed, networks will remain patchy,
fragmented and businesses will suffer.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour seeks a unified position on
Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour leadership yesterday attempted to broker a unified party response
to Denmark's refusal to ratify the Maastricht treaty.
It is threatening to vote against any 'improper' attempt by the government
to resubmit legislation until a clear way forward has been proposed.
In an amendment to a motion for consideration by the parliamentary Labour
party from Mr Tony Benn, the veteran leftwinger, calling on Labour MPs to
support a referendum on the treaty, the leadership has instead argued that
the UK should reconsider its stance by approving the social chapter and
greater democratic accountability.
But in an alternative move, members of Labour's so-called 'soft left'
grouping have tabled a second amendment demanding outright opposition to the
government and 'a fundamentally different treaty', promoting democratic
accountability in European Community institutions.
The three strategies, due to be debated by Labour MPs tomorrow, have
underlined growing differences within the parliamentary party on the correct
strategic approach to the new circumstances.
While Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, yesterday kept open
the option of voting against the government, Labour's leaders privately
believe that any opening up of the treaty to renegotiation might frustrate
moves towards closer union, which it supports.
However, Mr Bryan Gould, a challenger for the leadership, sided with the
soft left by arguing that the current treaty was now 'dead'. In a speech to
Labour MEPs in Strasbourg, he called for democratic accountability for the
proposed European Central Bank; a strengthened social chapter signed by
Britain; and an enhanced 'regional dimension'.
Mr Gould called for the opening up of a 'new and more constructive agenda'
including a reassessment of defence, employment and energy policies.
'We should be clear that further ratifications and referenda on a
non-existent Treaty can only be charades', he said.
Tory opponents of Maastricht are increasingly looking to Labour as the best
chance of defeating the government. The official line states that Maastricht
'contains much official Labour policy . . . whose enactment would be
beneficial'. It adds: 'The best way forward would be a reconsideration of
the treaty during the UK presidency, with the purpose of including an
enhanced social chapter.'
At the weekend, Mr Kaufman said Labour would vote against the Maastricht
Bill if it was reintroduced before the confusion created by the Danish
referendum had been cleared. He also hinted that there might be
circumstances in which Labour would back a referendum.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: MPs attack banks over Maxwell cash
 -Pensioners say government aid plan inadequate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, NORMA COHEN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COMMERCIAL banks were put under heavy pressure yesterday as MPs on both
sides of the Commons put the onus on them to recognise their moral
obligation to the Maxwell pensioners.
The government also faced unease from both Labour and Tory MPs when Mr Peter
Lilley, social security secretary, was unable to give an assurance that the
government's measures would mean that all pensioners would continue to
receive a full pension indefinitely.
That concern was echoed by a number of pensioners in Robert Maxwell's
company pension schemes, who hailed the government's announcement of an
interim aid package, but said that it fell far short of what was needed.
In the Commons, Mr Lilley defended the offer as a move to tackle 'a
particularly acute short-term pressure which is unique to this case'.
Mr Richard Page, the Tory co-chairman of the all-party group of MPs
campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners, and other backbenchers,
urged Mr Lilley to keep up the pressure on the banks.
Other MPs from both sides of the Commons expressed anger at the position of
members of the Maxwell family.
Mr Frank Field, Labour co-chairman of the all-party group and chairman of
the cross-party social security committee in the last parliament, welcomed
Mr Lilley's enthusiasm 'for shaking warmly by the throat the banks,
financial institutions, companies, individuals and members of the Maxwell
family who have done so well out of the Maxwell years, in order to get
contributions to rebuild the pension funds'.
National Westminster Bank, one of the banks that holds shares claimed by the
Maxwell pension funds, said it had been considering a voluntary fund
launched by government and the City as a way of helping Maxwell pensioners
without admitting liability for their losses.
It added, however, that it had to put the interests of its shareholders
first and therefore could not transfer to the pension funds shares in Teva,
an Israeli pharmaceutical company, which are claimed by the funds.
They are also being claimed by the administrator of the Robert Maxwell
Group, the parent of the Maxwell private interests, as well as by the
liquidator of Bishopsgate Investment Management, trustee of the pension
funds.
Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, said he
was confident that banks and financial institutions holding some Pounds 217m
in securities belonging to the pension funds would return those assets.
'I'm taking a bet that the banks will return the Pounds 217m,' he said,
adding that even then pensioners would still need more than Pounds 200m to
meet all obligations.
He was critical that the government's measures appeared to exclude all those
who were not pensioners when the schemes collapsed but have retired since.
'A 64-year-old with 30 years' service who retires tomorrow will not be
helped,' Mr Trench said.
The scope of the measures will be tested by MPs today in the Commons debate.
Mr Field will be among those to press Mr Lilley for an assurance that if the
trustees say that the Pounds 2.5m announced yesterday is inadequate, then
the government will not end the scheme without making a further statement to
MPs.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: A crusade into Medieval law -
Review of pension fund regulation welcomed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE pensions industry, thriving under a loose patchwork of laws and
practices, faces a radical overhaul after yesterday's announcement of a
wide-ranging government review.
Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, said that an independent
commission, headed by Professor Roy Goode QC of Oxford University, would
study the framework of pensions legislation and make recommendations within
12 months.
The National Association of Pension Funds, the trade association that has
offered cautious endorsement of some elements of pension fund reform, said
it welcomed the commission.
The review is to follow closely a report from the cross-party Commons select
committee on social security, issued in early March, which recommended
sweeping changes to the trust law that has been the basis of pension fund
operation since the 1920s. The committee had concluded that trust law,
designed in the Middle Ages to protect the estates of knights on crusade,
may be inadequate in that it does not take into account that the interests
of trustees may be at odds with those of beneficiaries.
It also urged requirements for scheme members to be widely represented on
pension boards and a number of custodial practices designed to frustrate the
designs of larcenous pension fund managers hoping to secure scheme assets
for their own benefit.
Most significantly, Mr Lilley has specifically ordered that the commission
is to study what is acknowledged to be the thorniest issue facing the
industry: the ownership of assets. Many employers have seized upon the
existence of surpluses in recent years as an opportunity to take a
'contributions holiday', cutting their annual expenses significantly by
allowing high investment returns built up in prior years to cover employer
contributions for the future.
Depending on the wording of trust deeds, employers may legally withdraw huge
sums from their own pension schemes without sharing those benefits with
employees.
Indeed, it emerged during the select committee hearings that Robert Maxwell
was able to strip more out of the pension fund surpluses of companies he
acquired than he paid for them in the first place.
Pensions industry professionals say pension-fund reform cannot be considered
separately from ownership of assets. Thus far, there is no statutory answer
to the question, they say, but judgments about the best way to require the
administration of schemes is clearly dependent upon whom one believes they
belong to.
Meanwhile, it is expected that the new commission will have to address the
question of a compensation scheme for pensioners who may be affected by
future fund collapses. While Mr Lilley did not single out the construction
of a compensation scheme as part of the commission's remit, the select
committee specifically urged that one be studied.
Already the proposal is causing controversy within the industry, partly
because large, well run schemes have balked at the idea of paying to bail
out weaker ones.
Mr Tom Ross, partner at actuaries Clay and Partners and chairman of an NAPF
subcommittee studying a compensation scheme, said that the experience of the
US and other foreign pension-fund safety nets in other countries showed that
no scheme would work unless its participants were required to reduce their
own risks.
'My own view is that if a pension scheme compensation fund were set up, you
cannot give people a blank cheque,' he said. However, it was precisely those
schemes which were most reluctant to adopt certain minimum standards that
were most likely to need a scheme, he added.
'My own view is that no scheme will work unless it is compulsory.
'But none of these issues - compensation, ownership of assets, safety of
funds - can be considered on its own. They are all connected and must be
considered together.'
Industry professionals note that every other aspect of investment - life
insurance, bank and building society deposits, unit trusts and other retail
financial investments - are covered by a compensation scheme of some sort.
Pension-fund experts say that the construction of a compensation scheme
might well require amendments to trust law because trustees are required to
use assets solely for the benefit of members. Thus schemes would have to
argue that the construction of a scheme was in members' best interests
before they could be allowed to contribute to it.
Industry sources say that some months ago, the Department of Social Security
broached the question of compensation for the Maxwell company pensioners
with the industry and sought legal advice on the matter. The DSS dropped the
matter after learning that trustees were barred from any such payments.

THE Department of Trade and Industry adopted its normal practice with
investigations yesterday by appointing two experts to examine Mirror Group
Newspapers - a lawyer and an accountant.
Mr John Laugharne Thomas QC, aged 44, who is based at 4 Essex Court in the
Temple, London, specialises in a wide range of commercial and international
law in one of the leading commercial sets, or practices.
Mr Thomas was called to the Bar in 1969. He was appointed a Queen's Counsel
in 1984, and in 1987 became a recorder on the Wales and Chester circuit.
He has been a visiting faculty fellow in maritime law at the University of
Southampton for the past two academic years.
Mr Raymond Turner, aged 56, a senior partner with Neville Russell, a firm of
accountants with many insurance-sector clients, was previously part of the
team investigating BOM Holdings Group, a DTI probe launched in February 1990
and which reported earlier this year.
He has also previously worked on a number of confidential DTI
investigations.
His other appointments have included being liquidator to CR Driver, a small
insurance underwriting firm closely linked with London United Investments,
the insurance group that collapsed in May 1990.

fishing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BILL aimed at conserving British fish stocks received its second reading
in the Commons last night despite being opposed by three rebel Tory MPs,
David Owen writes.
Opposition to the measure by Mr David Harris, the MP for St Ives, Mr David
Porter (C Waveney) and Mr Robert Hicks (C Cornwall South East), helped
restrict the government majority to 29 (216-187).
Mr Harris expressed concern that fishermen from other countries would
'continue fishing while our boats are tied up.'
The Sea Fish (Conservation) Bill would restrict time at sea for some 3,800
vessels over 10 metres in length and increase sharply to Pounds 50,000 the
maximum penalty for breaching a fishing licence condition.
Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, said the government did not intend
extending restrictions on the number of days that fishing boats may spend at
sea to vessels under 10 metres in length 'unless it were necessary'.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lamont rules out early City reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGULATION of financial services will remain unchanged as a result of the
Treasury's new responsibilities for the industry, Mr Norman Lamont, the
chancellor, said last night.
On the day he took over responsibilities previously held by the Department
of Trade and Industry, Mr Lamont made clear that he did not envisage an
early shake-up in the City's system of self-regulation.
Speculation about possible reforms had been encouraged by the appointment of
Mr Anthony Nelson as economic secretary to the Treasury. Before he became a
minister he was a critic of the City 'club' and a proponent of extra powers
for the Securities and Investments Board.
At the minimum, yesterday's statement suggests that there will be no
immediate move towards giving the Bank of England a more direct role in
overseeing the City's investment markets.
Mr Lamont said financial services had become increasingly closely linked in
the UK and overseas, justifying the bringing together of responsibilities
into a single department.
'No changes are proposed in the way financial services are regulated as a
result of the transfer,' he said in a Commons written answer.
The transfer involved the functions and staff of the DTI's financial
services division. They covered policy, legislation and the overseeing of
regulation in the areas of investment business, collective investment
schemes, the issue of securities to the public and investor protection.
The Treasury will now have responsibility for the regulatory system set up
under the 1986 Financial Services Act, including overseeing SIB.
The DTI will continue to have responsibility for company law and for
investigations under the financial services, insolvency and companies acts.
It will retain responsibility for the insurance industry.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Football widens market: FT Satellite Monitor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of Premier League football on satellite television has extended
the potential market for satellite dishes, according to the latest FT
Satellite Monitor.
Since the publicity over the Pounds 304m joint BSkyB-BBC deal with the
Premier League last month, the number of people saying they will probably
get a dish has risen by more than 300,000, from 1.814m to 2.195m.
The numbers saying they will definitely get a dish, however, fell from
224,000 in April to 67,000 in May. Mr John Clemens, chairman of Continental
Research, which produces the monitor, believes potential purchasers may now
be waiting for the live football to begin in August.
The announcement of the deal has particularly stimulated interest among
unskilled workers and people aged between 45 and 64. Overall, the present
market potential for satellite television in the UK is 4.773m homes,
including those which have already installed satellite dishes.
Last month, about 68,000 dishes were installed, bringing the number of UK
households receiving satellite television on their own dishes or through
communal systems to 2.511m, or 11.2 per cent of households. Pearson, owner
of the Financial Times, has a stake in BSkyB.
The 68,000 figure represents a fall from 71,000 installations in April and
94,000 in March.

<TEXT>
A MULTI-million-pound contract for a microwave network linking the studios
of Westcountry Television, the new broadcaster for south-west England, will
be awarded today to National Transcommunications.
The Westcountry network will be the first such television system to be
independent of BT, which has been involved in the television industry since
the 1930s.
National Transcomm, formed from the engineering division of the old
Independent Broadcasting Authority, will be installing a network that will
not only link studios in the region but carry virtually all Westcountry's
internal communications and data links.
The deal is a small example of plans to modernise the UK's broadcasting
infrastructure and provide digital networks.
Earlier this year BT signed a Pounds 50m contract over 10 years for an
advanced digital network for Channel 4 - a network that will allow the
channel to broadcast different adver-tisements simultaneously in six
regional TV areas.
BT's broadcast and visual services division has started negotiating with the
main ITV companies and the BBC to provide them with modern digital
communications. Investment of about Pounds 100m is required.
BT has warned the broadcasters that the existing system, dating from the
1960s, cannot be sustained after 1994 as faults continue to increase.
'Some of the switches need oilcans,' said Mr Steve Maine, director of BT
broadcast and visual services.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Tenders to run council housing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSING associations and private-sector companies are to be invited to
tender for the management of 4m council homes under plans announced
yesterday by Sir George Young, the housing minister.
Launching a green paper setting out the government's proposals, Sir George
told a London conference on housing management that the extension of
contracting-out to council housing would help tenants getting a bad deal.
He said: 'There are too many estates where management breakdown is evident,
with empty properties boarded up for long periods or taken over by
squatters.'
Compulsory competitive tendering would encourage decentralisation and tenant
involvement in management, the minister said.
The plans were attacked by Mr David Blunkett, Labour's local-government
spokesman, as 'pure party-political dogma'. He said tenants would suffer
while some private companies made 'a killing'.
The government published a report on the scope for competitive tendering in
housing management, commissioned from consultants last year. It said that
competition would improve efficiency by focusing on cost accounting and
quality assessment.
The consultants recommended, however, that tendering for housing management
should be introduced gradually, to allow councils to develop the necessary
systems.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Exports lead textile recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTS are leading a patchy recovery in the textiles and clothing
industries, according to the sector's trade association.
In its latest quarterly report, the Apparel, Knitting and Textiles Alliance
(AKT) found that textile and clothing exports rose 9 per cent to Pounds
1.1bn in the first quarter of this year, compared with that period last
year. Imports edged 2 per cent higher to Pounds 2.1bn.
Domestic sales 'remained stagnant despite extensive price cutting', the AKT
said. Retailers continued a cautious approach to ordering, which encouraged
the manufacturers' drive for exports.
Mr Colin Purvis, AKT director, said: 'We are getting better at exporting,
especially to markets in southern Europe.'
Clothing exports grew 10 per cent to Pounds 445m, helped by a sharp rise in
sales to the Commonwealth of Independent States, albeit from a low level.
The largest export market remains Ireland, with Germany and France close
behind.
Textile and clothing imports from the rest of the European Community rose by
16 per cent, partly counterbalanced by a 7 per cent fall in imports from the
US.
The AKT has not published employment levels this quarter because government
estimates are 'unreliable'. Mr Purvis said Department of Employment figures
overestimated employment in the industry.

FT  09 JUN 92 / High Court approval for BCCI payout offer sought
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE liquidators of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International
(BCCI) went ahead yesterday with their move to obtain the High Court's
approval for an offer to creditors of a repayment of at least 30 per cent.
Mr Michael Crystal QC, counsel for the liquidators, told Sir Donald
Nicholls, the Vice-Chancellor - senior chancery division judge - that, in
spite of opposition from the BCCI creditors' committee, the liquidators
still considered that the deal they had negotiated with the government of
Abu Dhabi, BCCI's majority shareholder, gave the best chance of a
significant and swift return.
The deal, which involves the injection of Dollars 1.674bn (Pounds 920m) by
the Abu Dhabi government, has to be approved by courts in the UK, Luxembourg
and the Cayman Islands this month before it can be put to creditors.
The liquidators say it would increase the estimated return to creditors from
the range of 0 per cent-10 per cent to 30 per cent-40 per cent, with a first
payment of 10 per cent during the first half of next year.
It would be subject to acceptance before an autumn deadline by creditors
with admitted claims totalling Dollars 7bn - 70 per cent of the estimated
Dollars 10bn claims against the bank.
Mr Crystal told the court that, as part of the deal, the government of Abu
Dhabi would give up potential claims amounting to more than Dollars 2bn
against the principal BCCI companies. Creditors accepting the offer would be
required to give up any claims they might have against the majority
shareholders, and BCCI would give up any corporate claims other than for
debts arising in the ordinary course of the bank's business.
A sworn statement on behalf of the Abu Dhabi government said it must be
appreciated that Abu Dhabi was the principal victim of the BCCI fraud - it
lost more than Dollars 6bn. The fraud was carried out at a time when the
government held only a minority interest in BCCI and exercised no control
over its affairs. It never had any involvement in the fraud.
In deciding whether to approve the deal to be put to creditors, Sir Donald
will hear the views of the creditors' committee, the BCCI Depositors'
Protection Association, the campaign committee for the bank's employees,
various individual creditors and the government of Abu Dhabi.
The hearing is expected to last several days.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Consumers exercise a tight rein

   CONSUMERS continued to behave prudently in April
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
paying back more than they borrowed on credit agreements excluding
mortgages.
Demand for consumer credit shrank in the three months to April, according to
Central Statistical Office figures. This suggests that the repayment of
expensive debts accrued during the 1980s is a priority.
A Gallup survey, however, suggests that consumer confidence picked up last
month. The survey of more than 2,100 people found that the balance of those
who thought the time was right for making big purchases was the highest for
a year. In May, the balance - those who think the time is right minus those
who think it is wrong - was 8 compared with 0 in April.
According to the survey, confidence increased among all consumers,
particularly those aged between 16 and 24.
The seasonally adjusted figures from the CSO, which do not include mortgages
and account for about 15 per cent of total private-sector debt, show that
consumers repaid a net Pounds 114m in the three months to April, compared
with net repayments of Pounds 293m in the three months to January.
In April, the latest monthly figure available, consumers repaid a net Pounds
56m on agreements with finance houses, building societies and bank credit
cards that are part of the Visa or Mastercard system.
That compares with a net repayment of Pounds 71m in March and was the eighth
month out of the past nine in which net consumer credit has fallen.
The median forecast among City analysts was for outstanding credit to grow
by Pounds 75m.
Mr Keith Skeoch, chief UK economist at James Capel, the stockbrokers, said:
'Figures suggest that credit is very, very sluggish and provide no evidence
that people geared up after the April election.'
Although the overall net credit figure fell by Pounds 56m, it included an
Pounds 83m rise in borrowing on credit cards in April. That probably
reflected the 0.8 per cent rise in retail sales in April after the
Conservative general election victory.
In the three months to April, outstanding credit-card debt increased by
Pounds 239m, a sharp increase on the three months to January, when it grew
by only Pounds 34m.
New consumer credit advanced was also more buoyant. It was Pounds 4.1bn in
April, the highest monthly figure since December. In March, new credit
advanced was Pounds 3.9bn.
Measured on a three-monthly basis, new consumer credit advanced grew by 3
per cent in the three months to April, compared with the previous quarter.

Sue Stuart writes.
Residents welcome the races as a boost to the economy, but in recent years
the influx to an island with a population of only 70,000 has also brought
difficulties.
Mr Alan Bell, Manx tourism minister, said: 'Our biggest trouble is
logistical - getting to the island and then accommodating the numbers of
fans.' Over the past five years, the number of registered tourist beds has
halved because of declining tourism outside the TT period. The tourist board
has appealed for residents to accommodate race fans. The Isle of Man Steam
Packet, the island's only ferry service, has also cut services over the past
few years.

FT  09 JUN 92 / What the letters VAT could spell for industry: Business
fears about possible increases in taxation rates as Lamont grapples with EC
pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH businesses will be watching closely today to see if Mr Norman Lamont
becomes embroiled again in the continuing row with the European Commission
over value added tax.
The chancellor will be in Luxembourg for a meeting of finance ministers,
called primarily to discuss the EC budget. Even so, he is likely to find
himself under renewed pressure to accept the commission's plans for minimum
rates of VAT throughout the community.
Of much more direct concern to a wide range of British companies is any
potential fallout from the government's refusal to accept the proposal for a
15 per cent minimum rate.
Last week the commission hinted that Britain might, as a result, be
jeopardising its right to maintain zero rating on a large number of everyday
goods and services.
In spite of categorical assurances from the Treasury that Britain's present
position is guaranteed under the sixth VAT directive, the role of zero rates
will have to be reconsidered before the expiry of the directive in four
years' time.
Britain has zero rating in several fundamental areas, including basic
foodstuffs, children's clothes, public transport, books and newspapers,
domestic utility supplies, charities and the sale of property.
Previous threats to remove zero rating have met fierce opposition and while
those industries concerned see little immediate threat to their position,
any future change would be certain to provoke a similar response.
Train and bus operators, for example, are warning of dire consequences if
VAT was to be imposed on public transport. Britain, Denmark and Ireland are
alone in the EC in applying zero rating. Most other EC countries favour
reduced rates of VAT for transport fares - typically 5 per cent but reaching
as high as 19 per cent.
Fare increases from the imposition of VAT, coming on top of the customary
annual rises, would provoke an outcry, particularly among British Rail's
'captive' travellers such as Network SouthEast commuters.
VAT would directly lead to a downturn in revenues for the bus and train
operators: one estimate, for example, has suggested that a 17 per cent tax
on train fares would reduce BR's gross revenues by Pounds 180m.
Beyond the moves to impose a minimum 15 per cent VAT there is a parallel
proposal to consider taxing all passenger transport services at a special
reduced rate of at least 5 per cent. The UK air travel industry is already
resisting the plan vigorously. British Airways said it was strongly opposed
to this because the move would translate immediately into fare rises.
Imposition of the extra tax would pose a big handicap for water companies,
already planning to raise charges in England and Wales by an average of 5
percentage points above the level of inflation each year to finance the
industry's Pounds 28bn capital investment programme.
Water costs less in Britain than in all other European countries except
Spain, Belgium and Norway, but the modernisation programme to meet EC
standards is quickly pushing up charges. Mrs Dilys Plant of Ofwat, the
industry's economic regulator, said: 'The loss of zero rating would impose a
heavier burden on customers who are already finding prices high and getting
higher.'
The UK construction industry has already fought one battle with European
Commissioners over the imposition of VAT. In 1988 the European Court ruled
that the tax should be imposed at the standard rate on all construction
except house building and a limited amount of work on listed buildings and
work to help the disabled. As a result, only about a tenth of all building
work is not covered by VAT payments.
The Building Employers Confederation said that, given the European Court
ruling, it was unlikely the EC would be able to extend VAT charges to house
building. The prospect of the imposition of VAT on books, newspapers and
periodicals would probably lead to another 'hands off reading' campaign such
as that which recently drew together all parts of the industry to fight the
threat.
There have been claims that 15 per cent VAT on newspapers would cut
circulation levels by 10 per cent. Mr David Pollock, director of the
Newspaper Publishers Association, said: 'We remain emphatically of the view
that there is only one appropriate rate of VAT for newspapers - zero.'
Food and clothing manufacturers appear more relaxed about VAT, believing
their products are more price-resistant. The Food and Drink Federation
pointed out that 50 per cent of all food consumption attracts VAT - largely
through restaurants, take-away meals, snack foods and confectionery.
The supermarket group Safeway would not speculate on the likely impact of
VAT, emphasising that the government was committed to resisting change.
Mr Martin Taylor, chief executive of Courtaulds Textiles, said introducing
VAT on children's clothes would only slightly affect sales because 'people
really have to buy them'.
Charities believe they would be badly hit. Oxfam, whose shops raise Pounds
17m a year for overseas aid programmes, said charities were already
contesting the seventh EC directive on second-hand goods, which would impose
VAT on their sales.

FT  09 JUN 92 / AWD receivers to make 500 workers redundant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 500 of the 650-strong workforce at AWD, the former Bedford trucks
business put into administration last week, are being made redundant.
The redundancies were announced to a mass meeting at the AWD factory at
Dunstable, Bedfordshire, by joint receivers Mr Tony Thompson and Mr Roger
Oldfield of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. They said remaining
employees would resume production tomorrow of orders in progress.
Most of AWD's workers have been idle since the start of this year as a
result of the prolonged recession in the UK truck market and the failure of
some expected important foreign orders to materialise.
Mr Thompson told the meeting: 'A review of orders and available resources
has led us to conclude that the business can only afford a reduced
workforce.' However, he repeated the receivers' intention of selling AWD as
a going concern and said a number of 'substantial' companies had already
made approaches.
He said there would be a number of changes to improve AWD's financial
performance. He described the moves as a 'positive step'.
As recently as Novem-ber, AWD announced a Pounds 70m deal to supply 2,000
trucks to Iran which, after a Pounds 46m order from Zimbabwe, had been
expected to secure its future. However, AWD made only 22 trucks in the first
three months of this year, compared with 546 in the same period last year.
AWD was bought from General Motors in 1987 for about Pounds 20m by Mr David
Brown, a Yorkshire entrepreneur.

FT  09 JUN 92 / BA faces strikes in cabin crew pay row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AIRWAYS services in the UK and Europe face disruption after cabin
crew on short-haul flights voted to strike over pay cuts for employees in UK
regions.
The TGWU general workers' union said a ballot among 2,900 cabin crew members
had produced a two-to-one majority for strike action.
BA's proposals would mean cuts of Pounds 2,000 for employees operating
European and UK routes from Birmingham and Manchester who the company says
earn Pounds 12,000 a year.
Next year they would receive a pay rise only if inflation was above 4 per
cent. In addition they would lose holiday pay supplements.
BA said pilots and ground staff had agreed to similar proposals. The effects
of the cuts would be softened by such methods as phasing them in over an
18-month period.
Mr George Ryde, TGWU national secretary, said cabin crew would not tolerate
wage cuts while Lord King, BA chairman, and other BA bosses were 'handing
each other huge increases', and the compnay was reporting its second-highest
profits.
The TGWU would not say how many people voted in the ballot. BA managers
believe that might signify a low turnout, especially among London cabin
crew.

FT  09 JUN 92 / R&amp;D spending rises at most companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN and CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST British companies increased spending on research and development last
year in spite of the recession, according to government figures.
The second annual R&amp;D survey from the Department of Trade and Industry says
the 10 biggest spenders devoted Pounds 3.9bn to R&amp;D last year - 4.3 per cent
more than in 1990 - while their profits fell 17.1 per cent to Pounds 15.8bn.
The top dozen companies - those which spend more than Pounds 100m a year on
R&amp;D - account for about half of corporate R&amp;D spending.
The figures indicate that companies spend less than half the amount per
employee on R&amp;D than companies in the US and Germany.
ICI maintained its position as the UK's biggest spender on R&amp;D, with Pounds
596m, up 1 per cent from 1990.
Siebe, the engineering group that has grown into one of the world's leading
controls manufacturers, is the fastest rising star of the DTI top 20. Its
R&amp;D spending rose 66 per cent to Pounds 78m last year.
Glaxo moved up from fourth into second place, with a rise of 19 per cent to
Pounds 475m, ahead of Shell, GEC, SmithKline Beecham and Unilever.
The two large oil companies, Shell and BP, stand out for having cut their
R&amp;D spending. The fall at Shell was only marginal but BP (in seventh place)
cut spending by a significant 6 per cent to Pounds 308m.
The pharmaceutical companies emerge from the DTI scoreboard as by far the
largest R&amp;D spenders per employee and as a percentage of sales. Glaxo
devoted 14 per cent of turnover to R&amp;D and spent Pounds 13,330 per employee.
British Aerospace lifted its spending by 11 per cent to Pounds 263m in spite
of falling into loss for the year. BAe's R&amp;D rose from 1.5 per cent of sales
in 1990 to 2.5 per cent last year. At 11th-ranked Rolls-Royce, on the other
hand, R&amp;D fell 9 per cent to Pounds 216m.
The two acquisitive industrial conglomerates, BTR and Hanson, do not come
out of the survey well. BTR (ranked number 21) cut spending by 7 per cent to
Pounds 55m and Hanson (number 28) was unchanged at Pounds 34m. BTR devoted
0.8 per cent of sales to R&amp;D and Hanson only 0.4 per cent.
The highest-ranked service companies were BT in ninth place and Reuters in
17th.
The scoreboard is compiled for the DTI innovation branch by Company
Reporting, an external consultancy, and made possible by changes in
accounting rules from 1989 that require companies to disclose R&amp;D spending
to shareholders.
Those seem to be having an effect: 330 quoted companies reported R&amp;D in
their 1991 annual reports, compared with 230 in 1990.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Council anger at pay opt-out advice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT advice to local councils to opt out of national pay bargaining
has evoked a strong response from the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities.
The Environment Department, in guidance to the Local Government Commission,
which is advising on the future of the authorities, says the government
supports moves to 'greater realism, flexibility and performance-related pay
within the national pay negotiating framework'. It adds that it is also
encouraging authorities to opt out of that framework.
In a letter to Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, the
Labour-controlled association says that of the 25 authorities that have
already opted out, most arrived last year at settlements that were higher
than the national deal.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Five Tube lines miss targets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE OF London Underground's 11 lines have failed to meet the performance
targets announced by the government last month. On the system as a whole, on
average, 97.5 per cent of scheduled rush-hour trains were run.
The worst performer was the Victoria Line, which failed to run nearly 20 per
cent of scheduled rush-hour trains in the four weeks to May 22. Top
performer was the East London Line, which ran all its rush-hour trains.
London Underground blamed a long-standing matter of irregular wear on
trains' wheels, which was probably caused by faulty lubrication.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Warning on size of merchant fleet
</HEADLINE>

   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S merchant fleet has shrunk to the point where it can no longer play
a full part in the defence of the realm, a report commissioned by the
shipping industry claims, Richard Tomkins writes.
It warns that a national operation such as the Falklands campaign would now
be 'at best on the margins of practicality and at worst impossible'.
Although the Gulf war had involved Britain in a large-scale deployment of
its armed forces, the sea lift was achieved almost entirely through the use
of foreign-flag vessels on charter.
The report was sponsored by the Chamber of Shipping, the trade association
for British shipowners, which has unsuccessfully campaigned over several
years for government help to stem the industry's decline.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Botnar held 'talks' with Ford executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR OCTAV BOTNAR, chair-man and managing director of Nissan UK, negotiated
with a senior executive of Ford of Britain to head the company, it was
disclosed in the High Court yesterday.
Mr Ernie Thompson, sales director of Ford of Britain since 1986, said he
held two meetings with Mr Botnar in April and May 1986.
Mr Thompson was subpoenaed to give evidence on behalf of Mr Stan Cholaj, a
former Missan UK assistant managing director, who is seeking Pounds 1m in
damages for wrongful dismissal and breach of contract.
Mr Thompson said Mr Botnar explained that he was seeking to negotiate the
sale of Nissan UK to Nissan Motor, the Japanese carmaker.
The Ford executive said Mr Botnar realised that 'due to the somewhat
acrimonious relationship between him and the Japanese, it would be
impossible for him to remain in Nissan UK, if and when the Japanese bought
it'. Mr Thompson told the court he negotiated to become managing director of
Nissan UK, with Mr Botnar becoming initially chairman and chief executive.
He said discussions stopped when he heard that the negotiations for a
takeover by Nissan Motor were not progressing.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UDM told cost-cutting in collieries will continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNION of Democratic Mineworkers was warned yesterday that a successful
employee buy-out of British Coal would not reduce the need for continued
cost-cutting in the industry.
Mr Albert Wheeler, British Coal deputy chairman, said that, in spite of a
reduction of 33 per cent in deep-mine operating costs over six years, longer
underground shifts were needed, plus the virtual abolition of national
bargaining in favour of agreements suited to each colliery.
Mr Wheeler told the UDM national conference in Weymouth: 'We must question
whether national arrangements and national rates can give us the flexibility
to meet our needs.'
He pointed out that 22 per cent of miners' earnings already came from local
deals.
Mr Wheeler advocated six-day working, with one week off in four - as
practised at the new Asfordby mine in Leicestershire - for all collieries.
The UDM, which broke away from the National Union of Mineworkers in the
1984-85 strike and now represents about a third of British coalminers, is
keen to lead a possible employee buy-out, or part buy-out, of the
soon-to-be-privatised corporation.
Mr Roy Lynk, UDM president, said he had recently held informal meetings with
the British Association of Colliery Managers to discuss buy-out plans, but
he insisted: 'They have to join our consortium.'
Mr Lynk, who has previously warned that many senior managers would be
replaced in the event of a successful buy-out, envisages an employee stake
of at least 25 per cent. He is keen to attract individual members of the
National Union of Mineworkers, even though the NUM leadership remains
strongly opposed to the plan.
In spite of moral and financial support from the government for a UDM-led
employee stake, it is not certain to succeed. The value of the corporation
and the number of pits likely to survive privatisation remain uncertain.
Mr Wheeler warned yesterday that, without a satisfactory outcome in
negotiations with the electricity industry, British Coal's biggest customer,
'there will be little of value in the business to privatise'. The generators
at present buy 65m tonnes a year, which is likely to fall to 45m, declining
eventually to 30m.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Culture blamed for conflict with Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN practises a different form of capitalism from those of the US and
Britain. Neither side fully understands that, so each accuses the other of
cheating to protect markets, according to Professor Ronald Dore, an
economist at the London School of Economics.
Prof Dore, an authority on how companies operate in the three countries,
said yesterday there was a Darwinian struggle between Japanese and
Anglo-Saxon concepts of capitalism.
Addressing a Manchester Business School conference on Japanese multinational
companies, he said the Anglo-Saxon model made return on investment its first
priority, while this had ninth place in Japanese capitalism's priorities.
Japan placed most emphasis on maintaining market share to safeguard jobs in
companies and their suppliers.
Prof Dore said that was reflected in the Anglo-Saxon method of regular,
competitive tendering for sub-contracts and the sharp contrast of Japanese
companies' long-term relationships with suppliers.
The divergence also showed in equity markets. US and UK companies feared
their shares being instantly traded if they fell out of favour with
investors. In Japan, between 65 per cent and 80 per cent of any company's
shares were held by other Japanese companies with which they did business,
so they did not rock one another's boats.
The overall result was that Anglo-Saxon capitalism was driven by
self-interest while the Japanese model was more concerned with collective
good.
Prof Dore said that although people feared Japan would win the battle, this
might not happen. Each system was borrowing the other's ideas and much
evolution was by imitation rather than one species wiping out its
competitor.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Complaints body says coverage of royalty 'odious'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Press Complaints Commission attacked newspaper coverage of the
apparently strained marriage of the Prince and Princess of Wales as 'odious'
yesterday and warned that it threatened the future of press self-regulation.
Further criticism of newspapers came from Dr George Carey, the archbishop of
Canterbury, who said: 'The current speculation about intimate personal
matters has exceeded the boundaries which should be observed in a society
claiming to respect basic human values.'
Speculation over the state of the royal marriage has filled many newspapers
since Friday, when the front page of the Daily Mail claimed that the
Princess had attempted suicide during the 1980s.
The story was based on a biography of the Princess to be published in the US
next month. Other newspapers followed with detailed allegations from a rival
biography, serialised in The Sunday Times.
The Press Complaints Commission described some reports as 'an odious
exhibition of journalists dabbling their fingers in the stuff of other
people's souls in a manner which adds nothing to legitimate public interest
in the situation of the heir to the throne'.
It added: 'The state of the marriage has been put into the public domain in
part at least by the outward behaviour of the spouses and it is therefore a
legitimate subject within the public interest for report and comment by the
press.'
But it said that frequently the manner and tone of the reports was without
doubt in breach of the newspapers' code of practice.
Mr David Mellor, national heritage minister, welcomed the commission's
statement and said the government would take its views into account in the
government's review of press self-regulation at the end of this month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATORS from the US, Canada and Mexico are reported moving towards
agreement on a domestic content rule for vehicles that will provide
tariff-free status for cars sourcing 60 per cent of their output in North
America.
Canada's agreement to the rule, reached last week, was apparently secured
when the US and Mexico agreed to a liberalised rule of origin, exempting
from duties vehicles produced by some foreign-owned plants in Canada. The
new rules would include in local content some expenses at present disputed.
Thus the cost of interest would be included up to a pre-determined limit.
After intensive talks last week, Nafta chief negotiators were vague about
progress. Mr Julius Katz, deputy US trade representative, said: 'You make a
great mistake latching on to a single number or a single fact,' but he did
not deny the report that a car deal had been secured. Negotiators made
'pretty satisfactory progress', with some areas 'near closure and others
still unresolved for political reasons,' a trade consultant said.
Work continues this week and next on technical problems, before trade
ministers meet in Mexico to resolve the toughest issues. Financial services,
energy, textiles, and foreign investment remain the most difficult areas.

FT  09 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Japan's chip makers get down to brass
tacks - The American industry sees changing attitudes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE and STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US semiconductor industry could not have hoped for a more positive
outcome from last week's semiconductor talks in Japan. After more than 10
years' efforts to beat down the door to the Japanese semiconductor market,
the US industry has now obtained a public pledge from its Japanese
counterparts on measures to speed purchase of foreign semiconductors.
The new pledges could be a turning point. Before the talks, the Japanese had
said they were already doing everything possible to boost purchases of
foreign-made chips. Yet now the 10 biggest buyers have agreed to release to
US companies for the first time detailed semiconductor purchase plans
normally protected as commercial secrets. The change is not simply a result
of the Japanese side opening its eyes after seeing the stagnation of foreign
chip sales in Japan for the past two years. Rather, the Japanese now face a
US industry with strong political backing in Washington and the
all-important support of the US computer industry, raising the real
possibility that trade sanctions may be imposed if the market share of
foreign companies does not rise significantly from the 14.4 per cent
recorded at the end of 1991.
The US and Japan agreed last year that this share should rise to 20 per cent
by the end of this year. The Japanese say the 20 per cent was not a promise
or pledge, but anger is growing in Washington that no progress has been made
toward reaching the target. An inter-agency study of the agreement's
implementation, under Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, is due for
publication in August, when the US election campaign will be moving into
high gear. The Japanese need to show quickly that the agreement was more
than an empty pledge.
'I believe Japanese companies are concerned that sanctions are right behind
(if nothing happens),' said Mr James Norling, president of Motorola's
semiconductor group and vice-chairman of the US Semiconductor Industry
Association. Beyond the threat of government action, big Japanese groups
have more reason than ever to co-operate and boost US chip sales in Japan,
since the balance of commercial power between the Japanese and US
semiconductor industries has shifted. Mr Wilfred Corrigan, chairman of LSI
Logic, said: 'The big guys who can pull this off are the ones to benefit if
trade relations improve, and lose most if trade friction heats up.'
In past years, Mr Corrigan and Mr Norling say, the Japanese industry was in
a stronger position. Japanese companies gave a terrible thrashing to the US
industry as they strove to achieve complete domination over the market for
dynamic random access memory chips, a key memory device used in all personal
computers and a whole range of electronic devices. But after driving several
US companies out of the field, Japan's victory has proved pyrrhic. A rapid
rise in output of high-capacity memory chips in Korea and Taiwan has helped
to drive down world prices to a point where Japanese companies are unable to
make returns on their investment. In recent weeks, Japan's big chip
producers have reported steep declines in profits as a result.
Also, the US hold on the products such as microprocessors has grown tighter.
Mr Corrigan says: 'The good parts of the business are extremely intellectual
property intensive.' This where the US companies excel. But growing US
industry confidence is tempered by a degree of scepticism toward the latest
Japanese pledge to increase chip imports. A huge surge would have to occur
in Japanese orders for foreign semiconductors over the next two months to
have an effect on trade data before the US inter-agency review is completed.
No guarantee can be made that US chip sales in Japan will rise, but clearly,
the big Japanese purchasers are determined to break the deadlock. The
Electronic Industries Association of Japan is to tell its 62 members to
increase purchases of US chips faster than for Japanese chips as the market
enters its expected recovery phase later this year. Under the industry
agreement forged in Tokyo, the Semiconductor Industry Association of the US
will publish a monthly index of Japanese orders, providing a more timely
indicator of the market share trend than the quarterly market share figure
put out by the US and Japan.
This will enhance the ability of the US industry and government to respond.
The Japanese industry efforts are being welcomed as a positive development
by US industry executives. But concern still exists that the 'emergency
measures' may be short-lived and serve only to delay a US government
decision on retaliatory sanctions until after the November election. Another
flaw is that the new measures do not involve smaller Japanese chip
purchasers. The US side is now counting on the biggest 10 companies, who
account for 50 per cent of the market, to do more than their share. Most of
these companies already buy over 20 per cent of their chips from foreign
companies; they may now have to push this higher to stop the trade row
growing.
Mr Shinichi Itoh, vice-president at NEC, the Japanese electronics company,
said access to the market would also be improved for European makers, but
nothing specific was on offer. Mr Corrigan poured scorn on European
complaints that the US was getting preferential access. 'Enthusiasm of the
European companies to penetrate the Japanese market does not seem high.'
European companies could not complain while protected by a 14 per cent
tariff barrier.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Stepped-upsecurity slows crime rate: Reported incidents have
fallen by 50 per cent in some of the more affluent suburbs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the benefits of the Earth Summit for local residents has been the
spectacular drop in crime in Rio de Janeiro's smarter neighbourhoods. A
combination of 35,000 army and police personnel and 10,000 extra hotel
security guards has caused the number of reported incidents to fall by as
much as 50 per cent in some areas.
Locals are already asking for the army to stay after the party is over, but
the high command is fearful troops may be corrupted if they remain in
contact with Rio for too long.
Not everyone is happy with the stringent security arrangements. Foreign
correspondents at the conference centre are compiling a petition to protest
about the assault on a Visnews television reporter by Brazilian security
guards after he failed to stop when running with a tape to catch a satellite
feed.
'Brazilians assume that only thieves run,' complains a colleague.
The current villain of the summit, US President George Bush, will, it
transpires, be spending his birthday in Rio. Given the present isolation of
the US adminstration, rotten tomatoes and protest banners are more likely to
be the order of the day on June 12 than cakes and candles.
A taste of what is to come was made clear during an ecological march along
the beach on Sunday at which the most polite banners carried statements like
'Bush Lead or Get Out of the Way', 'USA Join The World' and 'You're
Embarrassing US'.
Journalists have been surprised at how freely US officials are handing out
copies of the notorious leaked memo from Mr Bill Reilly, Environmental
Protection Agency chief, which asks the White House to agree a 'fix' on the
controversial biodiversity treaty.
Enemies at work trying to embarrass the man further? Apparently not.
Insiders say Mr Reilly's supporters are distributing it in order to assert
his green credentials and to try to shame the White House into a last-minute
face-saving initiative.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Bad year for Colombian president: Power cuts and guerrilla
warfare torment Gaviria as he waits to meet Major
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARITA KENDALL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FOR Colombia's President Cesar Gaviria
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
unlike the British prime minister to whom he plays host today and tomorrow -
1992 has been a bad year. As recently as four months ago, everything seemed
to be going his way: his main economic and political reforms were in place
and peace talks with Colombia's two main guerrilla groups were still alive.
Now electricity rationing, an escalating guerrilla war, a recalcitrant
congress and hostile trade unions have contributed to a collapse in his
government's popularity.
Power cuts of at least seven hours a day have been the main factor in
reducing forecasts for economic growth this year: 2 per cent, barely enough
to keep pace with population growth, instead of the 4 per cent previously
forecast.
A survey by the association of small industries found that four-fifths of
companies have had to cut production and one-fifth have laid off workers.
Agriculture output has also been hit.
The direct cause - the country is 80 per cent dependent on hydro-electricity
for its power - is outside the government's control: a prolonged drought.
But bad planning, corruption, heavy debts and inefficiency have contributed
immeasurably to the crisis.
Firm - if somewhat belated - handling of the electricity disaster has
improved the president's standing. But, as he himself pointed out, sacking
top officials and emergency measures to restore full power by the end of the
year cannot compensate for economic and other losses.
On top of this, peace talks with guerrilla groups collapsed more than a
month ago, resulting in an escalation in violence. Mr Gaviria, endorsing a
military offensive against the groups, has said the aim is to force them
back to the negotiating table.
However, the whole idea behind the peace process is being jeopardised by a
judge who is asking for warrants to be issued against the leadership of the
former guerrilla movement M-19, now converted into a political party after
making peace with the government in 1989. The warrants are being sought in
connection with the M-19 takeover of the Palace of Justice in 1985, in which
more than 100 people were killed.
Faced with the dynamiting of power lines, air navigation aids, television
transmitters and pipelines, as well as daily kidnappings and bomb explosions
in cities, the majority of Colombians now rate the guerrilla war as the
country's main problem.
Foreign oil companies are the main target for the National Liberation Army,
one of the active guerrilla groups. Mr Major will be landing close to their
territory when, as planned, he goes tomorrow to BP's big discovery at
Cusiana in the Andean foothills northeast of Bogota.
British investment in Colombia, especially in the oil sector, has grown
significantly in the last decade. BP alone is spending Dollars 200m (Pounds
110m) on exploration this year. This presence, combined with Mr Gaviria's
dedication to liberalising the economy, laid the foundation for talks
between the two heads of government in the presidential guesthouse on the
shore of Cartagena Bay.
Drugs - both heroin and cocaine - continue to be an important issue.
Colombia has a wide range of subjects on the agenda, particularly economic
issues such as EC trade access and the revival of the coffee pact. Despite
the slump in coffee prices to near 22-year lows, greater export volumes have
kept Colombia's earnings close to last year's level.
Overall, export income was slightly down in the first five months of 1992,
but this did not dampen growth of international reserves. The figure for
reserves - Dollars 7.3bn last week - is more a discomfort than a joy, partly
because it increases inflationary pressures.
Income from 'tourism' rose from Dollars 139m in the first five months of
1991 to Dollars 391m in the same period this year, though the tourist is a
rare species in Colombia.
Reserves are now forecast to grow by Dollars 2.2bn this year, instead of
Dollars 1.2bn originally expected.
The main reason for the continuing inflow is the higher return on money in
Colombia, together with a tax amnesty. Although analysts have given up
trying to separate the bad money from the good, the tightening of banking
legislation in the US to reduce money-laundering has probably helped
encourage the return of funds.
The administration is also having one of the cornerstones of its economic
policy chipped away by congress, despite a majority for Mr Gaviria's
Liberals. This is tax reform designed to replace the fiscal income lost as a
result of lowering import tariffs and to allow for transfers to local
government required under the new constitution. But, even after frantic
negotiating to push through a mutilated version of the reform, the outcome
remains uncertain.
However, despite current setbacks, Mr Gaviria has already committed Colombia
to the free market road and seems prepared to battle his way along it for
the second half of his presidency.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Guerin funds went to prince's equerry

MR James Guerin, the former deputy chairman of Ferranti who will be
sentenced to prison in the US today on fraud, money laundering and illegal
military export charges, used Swiss bank accounts to transfer more than
Dollars 1.2m (Pounds 650m) of stolen corporate funds to Sir David Checketts,
a former private secretary and still-serving equerry to Prince Charles.
Until 1989 Sir David also worked as a London-based executive at Ferranti,
the UK defence electronics group.
The disclosure, contained in a court filing by US prosecutors, also states
that Sir David - who has not been accused of wrongdoing - was interviewed
last year by Britain's Serious Fraud Office (SFO) in connection with the
fund transfers.
Mr Guerin, who in 1987 sold International Signal and Control (ISC), a
Pennsylvania defence company, to Ferranti, will be sentenced on charges of
defrauding Ferranti of Dollars 1.1bn, engaging in Dollars 950m of money
laundering and illegally exporting military technologies to South Africa and
Iraq.
Sir David, who last night was advised by his solicitor not to comment on the
matter, resigned in 1989 as the managing director of ISC Technologies Ltd, a
UK affiliate of the ISC-Ferranti group. He first joined ISC in 1979 and
served as an international marketeer of defence electronics, aerospace
products, missile systems and educational equipment. Sir David, aged 62, who
served as private secretary to Prince Charles between 1970 and 1979, remains
an extra equerry to the prince. This post was described by Buckingham Palace
last night as 'a very part-time position'.
In 1989 Sir David denied any knowledge of the ISC fraud and said his
resignation from the Ferranti group was 'not directly' related to the ISC
affair.
According to the US court documents Mr Guerin 'invested substantial sums
with another business associate and executive of ISC, Sir David Checketts.
During the period 1986 through 1988, Guerin disbursed Dollars 1,258,510 to
Penselworth Ltd. . . a company formed by Checketts to invest in a shuttle
air service and a printing company'.
A US official said the Dollars 1.2m transferred by Mr Guerin to Sir David's
company in the UK was part of the stolen corporate funds included as part of
the conspiracy section of the indictment of Mr Guerin. The indictment says
these included funds diverted from ISC for Mr Guerin's 'personal benefit and
the benefit of others, including payments to relatives, friends and business
associates'.
The documents further show that Sir David received the funds in six
transfers to accounts at Barclays Bank in the UK from Swiss bank accounts
opened by Mr Guerin in the name of fictitious entities with names such as
Severn, Loreo, Held and Rovigo.
The SFO last night confirmed it had questioned Sir David last year and said:
'Even though our investigation is still technically open, we are satisfied
that those indicted in the US are the primary defendants to the allegations
of fraud with which this office is concerned.'
In London, Ferranti declined to comment on the matter.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK looking to Latin America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The visit to Colombia by Mr John Major, the first to South America by a
serving British prime minister, reflects a decision to assign more
importance to Latin America in British foreign policy, according to UK
officials, writes Stephen Fidler, Latin America Editor.
The increased interest in the region represented 'a new departure in foreign
policy', according to a senior official. Three government ministers,
including foreign secretary Douglas Hurd, who visited Mexico last month,
have already been to Latin America this year.
The move follows the shift to democracy by Latin governments and their
abandonment of the import-substitution model of economic development, which
had damaged trade relations. Now there was a convergence of interest between
Britain and Latin America, the officials said. The success of liberal,
market-friendly economic policies were already apparent in Mexico, Chile,
Venezuela, Colombia and Argentina.
Mr Major will visit Cartagena, Bogota and the Cusiana oil field before
flying to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro late on Wednesday. It is not
his first visit to Colombia; he was there in 1984 as a government whip.
Mrs Margaret Thatcher attended the North/South summit in Cancun, Mexico, in
1981 but this was not an official visit to Mexico.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PANAMANIANS from jobless slum dwellers to wealthy businessmen plan to make
their grievances known to US president George Bush when he visits on
Thursday for the first time since he ordered an invasion of their country,
Reuter reports from Panama City.
All of them accuse the White House of doing too little to resolve lingering
problems caused by the December 1989 military strike that toppled strongman
General Manuel Noriega and killed at least 520 Panamanians.
'There are a lot of people in Panama who feel that the US should continue
giving to this country, that the aid hasn't been sufficient,' said a senior
Latin American diplomat.
'They'll take advantage of Bush's visit to ask for more.'
On the surface, Panama's post-invasion recovery looks sound. But prosperity
over the past 2 1/2 years has failed to reach much of the population.
Unemployment in the port city of Colon has climbed to 50 per cent by some
estimates. In Panama City, where drug abuse has soared since the invasion,
police are battling a crime wave that appears unlikely to go away soon.
And the country's image is tainted by incessant reports that money
laundering has fuelled its booming construction and banking industries.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Conference on fishing agreed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARTH Summit delegates are to hold a big international conference on the
contentious issue of over-fishing and dwindling world fish stocks.
A Canadian-led move to increase international co-operation on the issue had
been resisted by the European Community and Korea, but delegates at the Rio
de Janeiro summit were finally persuaded by the argument that over-fishing
contravenes the principle of sustainable development. A conference will be
held next year under UN auspices.
Countries such as Canada, Iceland and many Latin American nations had voiced
concern that foreign over-fishing on the high seas was depleting national
fish stocks.
The main worry was over straddling stocks - fish that cross between the
exclusive economic zones of different countries or between those zones and
the high seas - as these are not included in the Law of the Sea regulation.
The Canadian delegation said it had voluntarily reduced its total allowable
catch of northern cod by more than half to 120,000 tonnes in February and
was likely to announce a new cut soon.
A resolution on a fishing conference will form part of Agenda 21, the global
action plan on environment which is one of the main Earth Summit documents.
The conference will not affect the Law of the Sea.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Collor signs treaty on greenhouse gases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor and CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Earth Summit has produced its first result, with the signing by Brazil's
President Fernando Collor of one of two treaties being considered by the
conference - on climate change.
The treaty aims to oblige countries to reduce emissions of greenhouse gases,
particularly carbon dioxide, which are believed to result in global warming.
But like most conference documents it has been widely denounced as
ineffective, and some countries are exploring ways to strengthen it.
The crucial weakness is that it does not impose any targets or deadlines on
signatory countries.
The original intention was to require that CO emissions be reduced to their
1990 levels by the year 2000. But the US - worried about the economic impact
 -took exception to this and argued it was more important to concentrate on
ways to cut emissions than on specific targets. As a result the treaty now
only requires signatories to formulate plans 'with the aim of' returning
emissions to their 1990 levels.
But there are other provisions in the treaty to give it clout. For example,
the industrialised countries which produce the greatest amount of CO must
produce their plans within six months of the treaty coming into force (which
happens after 50 countries have ratified). Developing countries have up to
three years.
The wealthier countries have also agreed to provide financial assistance and
technology to Third World nations to help them deal with global warming.
But the precise terms on which this help will be given, and how much of it
will be available, is still the subject of tough bargaining. There is
agreement, though, that for now all aid will be channelled through the
Global Environment Facility, a financing vehicle jointly administered by the
UN and World Bank.
Signatories will also have to provide and regularly update information about
emissions and plans for dealing with them. There will be two formal reviews
of progress by all signatories before the end of the century. Germany has
offered to host the first.
Two constituencies which have welcomed the treaty in its softer final form
are the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) and the
business community.
Opec is still worried the treaty will lead to carbon taxes and other
measures to curb use of oil, but the threat is now reduced. The
International Chamber of Commerce feels the treaty is a good thing now it is
less restrictive. Mr Michael Kohn, chairman of the ICC energy commission,
described it as 'a realistic and significant step forward'.
But many countries wish it was tougher. Ms Ruth Feldgrill-Zankel, the
Austrian environment minister, is trying to drum up support for a
'declaration of like-minded countries' who would voluntarily subscribe to
tighter targets. 'I was convinced from the beginning that we should give
clear signals,' she said. She has the backing of Switzerland and the
Netherlands, but other potential supporters are not keen on side
declarations.
Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, regretted the treaty
'unfortunately does not contain an adequately binding commitment to CO
stabilisation'. But he pointed out that EC countries have already set
stabilisation targets.
IN an apparent attempt to seize the initiative and fill the Earth Summit's
leadership vacuum, Mr Klaus Topfer, the German environment minister, said
yesterday he was leading a move for an EC declaration on stronger action to
reduce carbon dioxide emissions, writes Christina Lamb in Rio de Janeiro. He
also called on other countries to commit themselves to stabilising emissions
by the year 2000 and for signatories to act before the convention becomes
effective.
Mr Topfer said he would like to see EC and EFTA countries joining forces on
the issue.
A senior EC official confirmed yesterday that the Community was preparing a
statement calling for immediate action on emission reduction, to be read by
Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the Portuguese prime minister, when he signs a treaty
on climate change later this week.
A joint European move emphasising dissatisfaction with the treaty, which was
weakened to accommodate American concerns, would increase US isolation at
the summit.
US fears of this were highlighted when Mrs Ruth Feldgrill-Zankel, the
Austrian environment minister, confirmed she had received a cable from
Washington requesting she drop moves for an initiative to strengthen the
treaty. She said the strongly-worded cable had been 'based on a
misunderstanding' and added that her initiative was 'far from dead'.

FT  09 JUN 92 / US and Russia race to secure N-arms accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA and the US yesterday made a final effort to bridge differences on
nuclear disarmament in time for an agreement to be concluded at next week's
summit between Presidents George Bush and Boris Yeltsin.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, and Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian
foreign minister, met in Washington yesterday in a bid to decide on how to
cut their nuclear weapons forces beyond the levels to which they are already
committed by the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty (Start) signed last year.
Mr Kozyrev said the two countries had a 'unique opportunity to make a major
step beyond the Start treaty'. His US counterpart, however, warned that the
gap between the two remained wide.
'We're not there yet. We've got some substantial ground to cover,' Mr Baker
said.
Start set a limit of 6,000 warheads on each country's strategic nuclear
arsenal, although differences in the way these are counted under the treaty
would mean the actual number of warheads would be higher.
As the Soviet Union crumbled last year the US proposed to cut the number of
warheads to 4,700, with the elimination of all land-based multiple warhead
missiles.
The US is particularly keen to eliminate the Russian SS-18 missiles, which
carry 10 warheads each.
Russia countered with a suggestion for an even deeper cut to 2,500 warheads
that would also eliminate submarine-launched multiple warhead missiles.
While the two sides appear near agreement on a number close to the US
proposal of 4,700 warheads, they remain far apart on the type of missile
that should be cut.
US insistence on eliminating land-based multiple warhead missiles is based
on the principle that these missiles are uniquely destabilising. This is
because in theory it would be tempting to launch the missiles quickly in
order to stop the enemy from destroying them in their silos with a first
strike - the 'use them or lose them' principle.
The argument is also, however, disingenuous. Since land-based missiles make
up the bulk of the Russian nuclear arsenal, whereas the US strength is
primarily in its submarine-launched missiles, a ban on land-based multiple
warhead missiles would weigh disproportionately on the Russians.
There is some concern in the US that the Bush administration, by sticking to
its demand for such an asymmetrical ban, may jeopardise the chances of
winning substantial nuclear arms cuts.
'It would be foolish to forego the opportunity for steep reductions because
you are hung up on a demand that isn't very realistic,' said Mr Jack
Mendelsohn, deputy director of the Arms Control Association, a Washington
group monitoring disarmament issues.
Many arms control analysts believe it should not be beyond the wit of Mr
Baker and Mr Kozyrev to craft a compromise - especially as any agreement on
deep cuts in the number of warheads would force Russia at least to reduce
its land-based multiple warhead missiles, since these make up such a large
proportion of its total force.

WHILE official Earth Summit delegates drily discuss strategy in small
fibreglass cubicles, members of 2,000 non-governmental organisations are in
tents 30 miles away in a seafront park debating how they would save the
planet.
A replica Viking ship bobs in the harbour. A group in black body stockings
sing bossa nova while manipulating a large Muppet sat astride a leather bag.
Stalls sell everything from Earth Repair Handbooks to Grow Your Own Mini
Ecosystem kits. A blue fibreglass globe balanced on a cluster of iron bars
spits and sizzles as its creator, Antenor Colussi, explains that it is
generating ozone from a 48,000-volt box underneath. 'This shows we can
produce ozone and send it to the North Pole,' he explains to passersby.
This is the parallel conference, where everything from feminism to socialism
to racism is on the agenda along with the environment. Inside the tents,
groups discuss diverse topics such as 'Breastfeeding is an Ecological Act',
'Mental Pollution in the Inhabitants of Large Cities', 'The Culturing of
Worms in the Process of Organic Fertilisation' and 'Zambian Women and
Energy-Efficient Cook Stoves'.
Everyone is here, from the World Bank to the Film-makers' Union of
Kazakhastan, the Brazilian state mining company to the Socialist Youth,
Olivia Newton John to the Grand Mufti of Syria. On the grass, orange-robed
swamis sit crosslegged and meditate in the baking sun.
Sessions include workshops on alternative technologies, debates on climate
change and discussions of the environmental problems of China and the
sustainable development successes of countries such as Botswana and Costa
Rica.
An Earth Parliament of spiritual leaders and parliamentarians has attracted
such noteworthy participants as His Holiness the XIV Dalai Lama - who told
crowds he was having 'fun, fun, fun'.
A daily meeting of engineers and architects is putting forward plans for an
'Ecopolis' - the environmentally friendly city of the future. Designs
resemble giant beehives suspended over water where families live on shelves
and park boats underneath.
There is much to see, discuss, and marvel at, but the Global Forum as it is
known has not succeeded in its objective of pressuring delegates at the
official conference. However, NGOs have had considerable input in the treaty
formulation process before Rio and will be essential for monitoring
governments to ensure they stick to what they sign.
The Forum, meanwhile, is facing financial difficulties. Still Dollars 2m
short of the Dollars 11.6m (Pounds 6.3m) target to fund the Rio event,
organisers are appealing for funds to 'ensure the legacy we leave is not one
of debt - the opposite of the goal of sustainable development.'

FT  09 JUN 92 / Japan's upper house passes UN peace troops bill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S upper house of parliament approved early today a controversial bill
that would allow Japanese troops to serve abroad in peace-keeping missions
for the first time since the end of World War Two.
The bill, voted in plenary session by 137 against 102, now goes back to the
more powerful lower house for final approval. The 252-member upper house
passed the Peace-Keeping Operations Bill two hours after reconvening a full
midnight session, a parliamentary spokesman said.
The bill, which had been subject to continuous filibustering tactics by
opposition parties, would allow Tokyo to send up to 2,000 soldiers abroad to
trouble spots as United Nations peace-keepers.
The diet's upper house had spent three successive all-night sessions on
interminable procedural motions.
To the annoyance of many Japanese, the politicians' tactics have reduced
debate over a serious revision in foreign policy to a farce. The ruling
Liberal Democratic Party together with two small centrist parties has a
majority in the chamber. But it had held back from forcing a vote for fear
of being accused of cutting short deliberation of a very sensitive bill.
So, the opposition Social Democratic and Communist parties have run riot
with the Diet rule-book. Knowing that procedural motions take precedence
over substantive ones, they filed no less than eight no-confidence motions.
They have then prolonged the voting through a technique called the 'ox-walk'
in which members edge their way toward the ballot box an inch at a time.
By yesterday afternoon, opposition members had perfected their technique to
the extent that a single vote took a record 13 hours and three minutes,
exceeding a record 11 hours 37 minutes set on Saturday.
The votes were taking so long that Diet officials relaxed a rule which
required members to ask special permission of the chairman if they wished to
go to the toilet during a vote.
Television viewers were treated to the unedifying spectacle of scores of
their elected representatives sleeping on the job.
Other film clips showed aides bringing piles of packed meals into Diet
waiting rooms.
The Diet's press office was flooded with 'countless' calls protesting about
the waste of taxpayers' money.
The marathon has taken its toll on members, many of whom are elderly. The
oldest parliamentarian, Mr Tadashi Yaoita, who is 87, was applauded in the
chamber when he staggered to the ballot box.
The bill's tortuous journey through the Diet reflects the deep divisions it
has caused in the country between those who believe that Japan must play a
bigger role in world affairs and those who think sending troops abroad would
infringe Japan's peace constitution.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A POWER struggle for the leadership of Lebanon's main Christian political
party, the Phalange, was resolved peacefully yesterday with the re-election
of Mr Georges Saadeh, a parliamentary deputy and minister of posts and
telecommunications.
At stake were the participation of the Maronite Catholic party in prime
minister Rashid Solh's government and a boycott of this summer's
parliamentary elections.
Mr Saadeh's victory indicates a degree of acceptance by Maronites of
Lebanon's Syrian-backed government and constitutes a severe setback for his
opponent, Dr Samir Geagea, the leader of the 'Lebanese Forces' Phalangist
militia.
The Lebanese army last week seized heavy weapons stored illegally by the
militia at Amchit and Jeita.
The Maronite synod opposes general elections while Syrian troops remain in
Beirut. Had Dr Geagea won the Phalange party leadership, the Maronite
community - about 30 per cent of Lebanon's population - would probably have
boycotted the elections.
Mr Saadeh has not defined his position on the issue, but is likely to
encourage his followers to vote.
Dr Geagea abandoned a career as a medical doctor to become a militia leader.
He was named minister without portfolio in the Lebanese government formed
last month, but resigned within hours to protest at the predominance of
pro-Syrian ministers in the cabinet.
Mr Saadeh maintained the Phalange should 'be present at the heart of
Lebanese political life' regardless of the imbalance. He felt that his
party's absence would further isolate the Maronite community which was torn
by the 1990 war between Dr Geagea and rebel Gen Michel Aoun. When Gen Aoun
was defeated by Syrian forces in 1990, many Maronites felt humiliated by the
deployment of Syrian troops in the Christian enclave.
The Phalange was founded by the late Sheikh Pierre Gemayel in 1936.
Relations between the party and the militia have been strained in recent
years as the political and military branches vied for leadership of the
Maronite community. With yesterday's election, the power of the militia was
further diminished.

SOUTH KOREA announced plans yesterday to build a Dollars 12.7bn (Pounds
6.9bn) international airport that it hopes will become the air transport hub
of north-east Asia, AP reports from Seoul.
The airport would handle up to 100m passengers a year and would be built on
a tidal flat between two islands off Inchon, the western port which serves
as South Korea's main trade base with China.
Financing for the project, however, is expected to cause concern since the
country's economy continues to be troubled by a high inflation rate and a
large trade deficit.
Construction of the airport and its terminals and roads would be completed
in 2020, said officials from the Transportation Ministry, which drafted the
plan. The airport would have four runways capable of handling 700,000
flights a year.
The officials said South Korea needed a new international airport to meet
the growing demand for transport between South Korea and China.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Indian ministers accused in stock market scandal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
INDIA'S parliamentary opposition was yesterday preparing to launch a fierce
attack on the government over the Bombay stock market scandal with the
allegation by one of their senior leaders that three cabinet ministers were
involved.
Mr George Fernandes, a former socialist industry minister and a Janata Dal
leader, claimed at a press conference that four ministers were involved,
including three of cabinet rank.
He declined to name them but said he was seeking an appointment with the
prime minister to brief him about aspects of the scandal requiring urgent
attention.
In similar vein, Mr L K Advani, former leader of the militant Hindu
Bharatiya Janata Party, said that fraud on such a large scale would not have
been possible without the direct or indirect support of senior members of
government.
Mr Advani claimed that the failure of the Reserve Bank of India (the central
bank) to take action sooner was proof that the brokers and bank employees
involved had well-placed political patrons.
A report of a Reserve Bank committee of inquiry published last week said
that banks and financial institutions stood to lose Rs30bn (Pounds 577m) as
a result of illegal securities trading.
In an effort to minimise the bank's losses, the government has yesterday
impounded the assets of 31 people and companies, including those of Mr
Harshad Mehta, the Bombay broker still detained by police for questioning,
members of his family and companies associated with him.
The seizure was made as a result of a decree published over the weekend
under which the government is also setting up a special court to try fraud
charges connected with the scandal.
A judge of the Bombay high court was yesterday expected to be named to
preside over the hearings.
The decree provides that impounded property shall be used to pay outstanding
taxes and debts to banks and financial institutions.
Mr PV Narasimha Rao, the prime minister, in an attempt to dispel a widely
held belief that there will be no criminal convictions in the affair, told
an Indian daily yesterday that 'there will be no cover-up, no shielding of
anyone.'
He added: 'We are absolutely clear in our mind that anyone who is at fault
will have to pay for his deeds.' The law would take its course and at speed.
The interview was published by the conservative Hindustan Times which on
Saturday called in an editorial for the resignation of Mr S Venkitaramanan,
the Reserve Bank governor, as 'unfit to hold the job he was entrusted with.'
Mr Fernandes called for the resignation of both the governor and Dr Manmohan
Singh, the finance minister.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Czechs lead Slovakia in the economic stakes: High
unemployment has fuelled resentment among Slovaks against Prague
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BEFORE last weekend's elections Mr Vaclav Klaus, Czechoslovakia's federal
finance minister, said his ambition was to become the first leader in
post-communist Europe to win an election while most of the electorate was
still suffering from economic reforms.
That ambition was realised in the Czech lands as more than 30 per cent of
the electorate voted for the man who abolished subsidies, freed prices and
reduced their real incomes by up to 20 per cent over the last 18 months. It
was a huge personal victory for the didactic former economics professor who
suffers fools badly and makes few concessions to opponents.
His support reflects belief that sacrifices would pay off in the medium
term. They have already produced benefits such as an internally convertible
currency, liberalised imports and the start of a mass privatisation
programme. This will make 8.5m Czechs and Slovaks small shareholders in more
than 4,000 state-owned enterprises. If the programme is successful it could
be adopted as a model by other post-communist countries, including Poland
and Russia.
The latest statistics also indicate that the unprecedented 29 per cent
decline in industrial production since January 1990 bottomed out in the last
quarter of 1991. Output is now starting to rise. The official statistics
furthermore still largely ignore the private industrial sector where output
has been growing for months, fuelled by rising foreign investment and
start-up operations by local entrepreneurs.
At the same time, inflation dropped from 58 per cent last year, largely
caused by the reduction of subsidies, to an annual rate of around 10 per
cent in April. Real wages and savings are also rising again, both in the
Czech lands and Slovakia, according to Mr Karel Dyba, the Czech economics
minister.
Exports are also rising strongly after a 30 per cent decline in volumes
between 1989 and 1991. This, and the growing inflow of foreign equity
capital, has allowed Czechoslovakia to reduce its net foreign debt from
Dollars 9.4bn (Pounds 5.2bn) last year to Dollars 9.1bn at the end of the
first quarter of 1992.
Voters in Slovakia, however, do not share the faith of the Czechs that the
recovery is just around the corner. Unemployment has risen from nil to 12
per cent over the last 18 months, three times the official rate in the Czech
lands. In the large Czech cities like Prague, however, employers cannot fill
vacancies, specially for skilled workers and office staff.
High unemployment has fuelled the resentment expressed in support for Slovak
nationalist and separatist parties in the elections. The worst hit areas are
one-industry towns like Martin in central Slovakia, where more than 10,000
workers once had jobs making Soviet-designed tanks, mainly for export.
The outgoing federal government in Prague, staffed largely by idealists who
played a key role in the November 1989 'velvet revolution', ordered sharp
cuts in output and imposed tight export controls on defence equipment,
leaving thousands unemployed. Mr Klaus is expected to relax these
restrictions which merely led to former Czechoslovak arms markets being
taken over by US and other arms exporters. Despite the association agreement
signed with the European Community last year, however, Slovak attempts to
follow the more westerly Czechs into EC markets are proving difficult.
Kosice steel works, near the Ukrainian border, managed to sell cheap steel
wires and coils to France, Greece and other markets in recent months.
However, this only provoked protests and threats of anti-dumping duties from
Eurofer,the European steel producers' association.
Meanwhile, unemployment could rise sharply once the mass privatisation
programme finally puts state enterprises into private ownership.
It is only at that point that the new owners are expected to exercise their
proprietorial rights by cutting bloated payrolls and closing loss making
plants.
The main question now is whether the strong support for economic reforms
shown by Czech voters will lead to the expected sharp increase in foreign
investment.
With labour costs only 10 per cent of those in western Germany, western and
northern Bohemia in particular are being targeted as prime sites for
producing low-cost exports to EC markets.
US investment bankers advising the Czech government estimate that projects
worth an estimated Dollars 5bn are in the pipeline as Czechoslovakia gears
up to overtake Hungary as the prime target for foreign investors.
How much of this investment flows on to Slovakia will be influenced by the
outcome of negotiations on the future of the Czech and Slovak federation.
But most US investors in particular expect to make their first investments
at least in the Czech lands, which are close to the EC markets, rather than
more distant Slovakia, says Mr Mart Bakal of Crimson Capital Corporation,
investment bankers to the Czech Ministry of Privatisation.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UN backs relief plan for Sarajevo airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Security Council unanimously approved early this morning a plan to send
1,100 UN troops to take control of Sarajevo airport and enable relief
supplies to reach the besieged Bosnian capital, as Serb irregulars continued
their shelling of the city.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali the UN secretary-general, had proposed the plan to
enlarge the 14,000-member peacekeeping force in Yugoslavia. It requires him
to obtain further Council authorisation to send in the bulk of the troops,
once all conditions for the mission have been fulfilled, including the
existence of an effective and durable ceasefire.
But the UN chief is authorised to dispatch, at his discretion, 60 military
observers to ensure that anti-aircraft systems and heavy weapons are
withdrawn from within range of the airport, at present controlled by Serb
forces.
The blockade of the airport and the main road links into Sarajevo has
prevented any food and medical supplies from reaching the 300,000
inhabitants of the city.
Heavy explosions ripped through the heart of the capital yesterday and thick
columns of black smoke rose from burning buildings across the city, where
some 300,000 residents are trapped. Moslem and Croat defenders hit back hard
for the first time in days.
More than 30 people were killed and 120 wounded over the weekend in some of
the worst fighting in a European capital since the Second World War.
Hospital officials said at least eight people had been killed yesterday.
Bosnian territorial defence units launched an unexpected counter-attack
against the heavily-armed Serb forces near an area where 40,000 Serb, Croat
and Moslem residents are trapped.
The territorial units include troops drawn from Sarajevo's close-knit ethnic
communities, including Moslems, Croats and Serbs.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK may back limit on Brussels to settle treaty row
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government plans to explore with its European Community partners the
possibility of limiting the Commission's powers to intervene in national
affairs in the hope of breaking the deadlock over the Maastricht Treaty.
The aim would be to make an addition to the treaty with a form of words to
tighten up the application of 'subsidiarity' - the principle that decisions
should only be taken at Community level if they cannot be taken by national
or local governments.
In Brussels, however, a senior Commission official cast doubt on the move,
warning that any tampering with the treaty could directly affect plans for
speedy ratification.
He accepted, however, that the UK, which takes over the EC presidency next
month, had 'got to be seen to be doing something'.
A spokesman for the current Portuguese presidency of the EC also ruled out
as 'quite impossible' any changes to the treaty. But he added that the
Lisbon summit of EC heads of government on June 26 and 27 may address the
issue: 'I think they will use the conclusions of the summit to restate the
commitment of the Community to subsidiarity.'
The British proposal is for an explanatory codicil to be attached to the
treaty before ratification. UK officials stressed there was no question of
renegotiating the main treaty text.
But it was acknowledged that the plan was fraught with complexities, leaving
it unclear whether it would be sufficient to resolve the current impasse.
Earlier in the House of Commons, Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary,
confirmed his opposition to any renegotiation of the treaty, warning that
such a move would put the EC 'back in the maelstrom'.
Facing demands from all sides to renegotiate, modify or abandon the treaty -
including one from Mr Kenneth Baker, the former home secretary - Mr Hurd
said this would merely revive calls for further centralisation of the EC
that the government had successfully resisted.
Under pressure from his own backbench MPs, Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour's
foreign affairs spokesman, warned that the opposition would vote against any
attempt to retable legislation ratifying the treaty without clarification of
the way ahead.
Downing Street confirmed later that the Maastricht bill, shelved last week,
would be withheld until the autumn.
EC foreign ministers agreed in Oslo on Thursday to press on with
ratification of the unamended treaty.
The Danish government concurred with this strategy as its partners argued
that any renegotiation risked the complete unravelling of the European Union
project. Mr John Major and Chancellor Helmut Kohl also endorsed the full
speed ahead strategy when they met in Bonn on Friday.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Maxwell pensioners to receive Pounds 2.5m help
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, NORMA COHEN and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday announced a review of pensions law to report within
a year and emergency grants of Pounds 2.5m to deal with the plight of those
worst affected by the theft from Maxwell company pension funds.
Announcing the grants in the House of Commons, Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, said: 'Rarely in the catalogue of crime has there been a
fraud as callous and despicable as the pillaging of pension funds by Robert
Maxwell.'
He said the grants were not compensation for pensioners, but 'temporary,
emergency funding' to help Maxwell schemes which were unable to maintain
payments over the next few months. If the schemes turned out to have
sufficient assets to meet their commitments, the funds - but not individual
pensioners - would be expected to repay the emergency grants.
The short-term funding is expected to last for five or six months at most,
until after a court ruling on allocating the Pounds 100m of disputed assets
frozen in the Common Investment Fund.
Those first in line for assistance will be 240 pensioners in the Headington
Pension Plan whose payments have been stopped, and 5,000 in the Maxwell
Communication Corporation works scheme who face drastic reductions from July
1.
The 'drip-feed' of temporary funding meets one of the main points urged on
the government by the 100-plus all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf
of the Maxwell pensioners. The issue has been rising up the political agenda
since more than Pounds 400m was found to be missing from Maxwell pension
funds.
Yesterday's announcement coincided with a lobby at Westminster in which up
to 1,000 Maxwell pensioners took part.
Mr Lilley was cheered by MPs for urging financial institutions which held
more than Pounds 200m in Maxwell pension fund assets as security against
loans to the companies to 'examine their consciences' about returning the
money to help the pensioners.
Last night about 20 Labour MPs tabled a Commons motion calling on the
government to recover cash by using its sequestration powers.
Though the pledge of Pounds 2.5m was seen as 'insultingly meagre' by Labour
and some campaigners, some ministers had argued against providing any public
funds at all, on the grounds that more pressure should be put on the banks
and that it would be impossible to 'turn the tap off once it has been turned
on'.
There was also a general welcome for the independent and wide-ranging review
of pension law and regulation, which will address the status and ownership
of pension funds. Mr Lilley also said he would implement a provision of the
1990 Social Security Act which would make any deficiency of pension funds
that have been wound up, a debt on the employer company. It has been a key
demand of Maxwell campaigners.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, welcomed some of the
measures, but said the total bore 'no relation to the full extent and depth
of the government's moral and legal responsibility in this matter'.
'It's a very nice sort of cosmetic move,' said Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman
of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group.

FT  09 JUN 92 / DTI launches inquiry into Mirror group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY and ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WIDE-RANGING inquiry into the tangled affairs of Mirror Group Newspapers,
the heart of the late Robert Maxwell's publishing empire, was launched
yesterday by the Department of Trade and Industry.
The announcement of the inquiry by Mr Michael Heseltine, secretary of state
for trade and industry, more than seven months after Mr Maxwell's death
could cause greater uncertainty for the newspaper group, which includes the
Daily Mirror, Sunday Mirror and The People.
It could also delay further the sale of the majority stake in the group
which is now, in effect, controlled by a group of banks led by National
Westminster.
The DTI inspectors, Mr John Laugharne Thomas QC and accountant Mr Raymond
Thomas Turner, have been asked to investigate 'the affairs and membership'
of MGN and, in particular, the flotation in April last year of 49 per cent
of the company's shares which raised Pounds 245.5m.
A total of 196.39m shares were offered, with Samuel Montagu, the merchant
bank, offering 114m in the UK. Apart from employees' stakes, more than 78m
shares were offered to institutional shareholders outside the UK by Salomon
Brothers International.
One of the key issues to be investigated will be whether the assurances
given at the time by the company and its advisers that there would be a
'ring fence' separating MGN from other Maxwell interests were credible.
Other issues are likely to include statements made in the flotation document
about the state of the MGN pension funds and the company's property leasing
arrangements.
Yesterday's government announcement revived ironic memories of a previous
DTI inspectors' report in 1971 which Robert Maxwell complained about for the
rest of his life.
That report concluded that Mr Maxwell had shown 'reckless and unjustified
optimism' in making statements he must have known to be untrue. 'We regret
having to conclude that notwithstanding Mr Maxwell's acknowledged abilities
and energy, he is not in our opinion a person who can be relied on to
exercise proper stewardship of a publicly-quoted company,' it said.
The appointment of the inspectors yesterday came as Maxwell pensioners
marched to the House of Commons to protest against the more than Pounds 400m
missing from their pension funds. The issue is due to be debated today in
parliament.
Some in the City expressed surprise at the decision to set up an inquiry so
many months after the scandal first broke. 'This owes more to the
government's political timetable than the position of the company,' one
banker said.
Ministers said privately the decision had been taken because the inquiries
of the Serious Fraud Office were going in a different direction. Ministers
were keen that matters of corporate governance be properly explored.
Key witnesses for the inspectors who have been appointed under sections
432(2) and 442 of the Companies Act 1985 will be senior executives of Samuel
Montagu and Smith New Court, brokers for the flotation. Sir Michael
Richardson, Smith New Court chairman, declined to comment. Samuel Montagu
said it would co-operate fully.
The news of the inquiry comes at a particularly difficult time for MGN. The
company is in the final stages of negotiating a Pounds 250m two-year finance
facility designed to meet its needs until its future has been determined.
Full accounts were expected to be published at the end of this month in
advance of a relisting of its shares, suspended since late last year.
It is unclear whether the relisting will now be held up, although specialist
advisers to the company said a delay was far from inevitable.
A lot of the basic work has already been done which should help the DTI
inspectors.
At the beginning of this year the directors of MGN commissioned consultants
Ernst &amp; Young to carry out a full study.
MGN last night declined to comment other than to say it welcomed the
decision to hold an inquiry and would co-operate fully with the DTI
inspectors.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Rio talks face clash over targets for development aid
</HEADLINE>

   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EFFORTS to resolve the impasse over the financing of a global environmental
action plan were stepped up yesterday as the Earth Summit moved into its
final phase.
A new north-south clash seemed inevitable over the level and timing of
financial commitments to the programme.
With only two days to go before the arrival of heads of state, European
Community countries and the Group of 77 developing countries held separate
meetings yesterday to discuss a new Brazilian compromise proposal on
financing, the most crucial conference issue. Further talks were planned
last night.
The G77 repeated its demand for industrialised nations to commit themselves
to a target for overseas development aid of 0.7 per cent of GNP by the year
2000, a level and date rejected by many of the richer, industrialised
nations. The US is one of the main opponents of setting a 0.7 per cent
target. Its current overseas development aid (ODA) level is 0.13 per cent
compared with a European average of 0.5 per cent. A US official described
the G77 demand as 'completely unrealistic - it would mean an enormous
increase in aid'.
The US delegation is concentrating efforts on securing agreement on finance
in an apparent attempt to divert attention from its isolation over the
treaty on species protection, which it refuses to sign.
The delegation also hopes to improve the atmosphere at the summit before
President George Bush arrives on Thursday. Mr William Reilly, head of the US
Environmental Protection Agency, said he was optimistic the issue of finance
would be resolved quickly.
The new proposal, drawn up by Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazilian ambassador to
Washington, calls for countries already committed to achieve the 0.7 per
cent level to do so 'as early as possible' while other developed nations
should agree to 'make their best efforts to increase their levels of ODA'.
Mr Ricupero said yesterday: 'I hope this wording will resolve the problem.'
But the G77 insists on firmer commitments. Mr Kamal Nath, the Indian
environment minister, said: 'The document merely affirms the 0.7 per cent
target but affirmation is not enough. We need a time frame. Without that the
conference is just laudable rhetoric.'
Baroness Chalker, head of Britain's Overseas Development Administration,
said Britain refused to be 'tied down to either figures or timetables.'
However, she pledged to raise UK development aid from the current levels of
0.3 per cent of GNP.

FT  09 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Strategists assess Europe after Danish
'No'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The European equity world reacted more or less coherently last week to the
Danish 'No' vote in a referendum on the European Community's Maastricht
treaty, the French decision to hold their own referendum after the summer
holidays, and the uncertainty this cast on the process of European Monetary
Union (Emu).
The Danish component of the FT-Actuaries World Indices dropped 6.1 per cent,
after a 4.8 per cent gain in the previous week when domestic polls were
pointing to a 'Yes' vote. The Nordic block registered a 3.2 per cent fall;
France one of 2.2 per cent for President Mitterrand's temerity; and the
Mediterranean bourses in Italy and Spain declined by 1.6 and 2.7 per cent
respectively.
Mr Andrew Bell, director of European strategy at Barclays de Zoete Wedd,
notes that bourses had a clear lead from their bond markets, with yields in
the Mediterranean rising by around one-third of a percentage point, and that
there were comparable moves in some of the Nordic countries.
There is a twin risk for countries either in or entering the European
exchange rate mechanism (ERM), says Mr Bell. Within the ERM, the Spanish and
Italian economies have unresolved structural problems, and embedded
inflation. For those outside, such as the Nordic bloc, the newfound
respectability of their currencies based on EC entry and economic
convergence might have to be deferred.
However, BZW is not pessimistic about European equity prospects. There was
little corporate news about last week to test reactions and the broker
thinks that, unless there is a prospect of the ERM actually falling apart,
equity markets will limit themselves to trading, rather than fundamental
asset allocation moves.
Meanwhile, Morgan Stanley's senior strategist Mr David Roche thinks the EC
must now try to draw up a new treaty covering Emu and European political
union (Epu) for member states. Major changes in any new treaty, he says, are
likely to lead to the emerg-ence of a 'twin-track' Europe with greater
emphasis on economic integration than on political unity.
Working along similar lines to Mr Bell, he says assets of countries which
have already achieved a large degree of convergence with the Maastricht
criteria for monetary union - France, Germany, the Benelux countries and, to
a lesser extent, the UK - should continue to command a premium.
His probable losers are Denmark, Italy, Spain and Switzerland (where, he
says, the referendum on the European Economic Area may be called into
question), and Sweden and Finland, which may see their applications to join
the EC delayed by the confusion.
Morgan Stanley likes non-European markets although, clearly, the Japanese
were not listening last week as the Tokyo market fell by 2.3 per cent.
Within Europe, Mr Roche believes that cyclicals and dollar-earners, German
financials, and defensive stocks are likely to outperform.
BZW's Mr Bell thinks that timing of European recovery and falls in German
interest rates will be much more important to equities than rows over
European union, and that cyclically exposed markets in Norway and Sweden
could bear study in the interim.
About Denmark, he says the Danes have done more than almost any other
country to achieve convergence with the ERM, at a price of a niggardly
growth rate in the 1980s while the rest of Europe was booming. So while they
face some risk of political reprisals, there is also the possibility that
the economy can improve its investment appeal.

FT  09 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei settles down to
await June futures settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE PRICES lost ground on small-lot arbitrage-related selling, and volume
fell to its lowest level since March 30 as investors remained inactive ahead
of this Friday's June futures settlements, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 134.98 at 17,655.06, its lowest since May 1. The
index opened at the day's high of 17,795.56 and fell to a low for the
session of 17,390.31 in the afternoon.
Volume was a mere 170m shares, against Friday's 182m. Declines outnumbered
advances by 726 to 204, with 166 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all
first section stocks shed 8.17 to 1,337.79, while in London the ISE/ Nikkei
50 index eased 3.78 to 1,054.18.
The 225-issue Nikkei was depressed by arbitrageurs unwinding
arbitrage-linked cash positions ahead of the June contracts expiry. While
bargain hunting by public pension funds and individuals helped to recoup
some of the initial losses, the buying failed to trigger institutional
trading.
Traders forecast a lull in market activity for the next few weeks. Foreign
investor buying, which previously led activity in the market, has slowed.
Dealers took profits on speculative theme stocks which had been previously
sought for short-term trading. Okamoto Industries retreated Y70 to Y1,310,
but Meiji Milk Products, the day's most active issue, ended Y3 firmer at
Y925.
NEC receded Y25 to the year's low of Y885 on profit-taking by foreign
investors. Other high-technology issues also weakened.
Mitsui Trust and Banking fell Y19 to a low for the year of Y764. Investors
were discouraged by reports of the bank's extension of additional loans to a
consumer credit company facing financial trouble.
Mitsubishi Paper Mills moved up Y4 to Y573 on its strong earnings forecast
for the current year to next March. The company expects pre-tax profits to
rise by 31 per cent and operating profits to increase by 12 times.
In Osaka, the OSE average slipped 235.40 to 20,252.26 in volume of 6.7m
shares. Volume fell due to the lack of fresh news. Mori Seiki, the machine
tool maker, lost Y10 to Y2,460, investors having become increasingly
concerned over weak machine tool orders. Roundup
THE LOWEST close for four years was recorded by the Seoul market in a
Pacific Basin region that, with the exception of Manila and Jakarta,
continued to weaken. Australia was closed.
SEOUL's stabilisation fund failed to stop the market from falling: the
composite index lost 5.55 to 563.65, but trading ended one hour earlier
because of a computer failure. Turnover was put at Won162.5bn.
The few gainers advanced on theme-backed buying. Sunkyong rose Won200 to
Won20,400 and Yukong added Won400 at Won24,800. Both companies are competing
for a contract to provide a second mobile telecommunications system.
MANILA, by contrast, continued to break records, the composite index closing
at another all-time high, up 63.07 at 1,580.28. Sentiment has been
encouraged by the likelihood that Mr Fidel Ramos will soon be officially
declared president after last month's elections.
HONG KONG was sent lower by profit-taking among leading stocks. The Hang
Seng index ended down 57.05 at 5,978.75 in turnover of HKDollars 3.83bn,
against HKDollars 4.24bn on Friday.
HSBC Holdings declined HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars 46.75 following Lloyds
Bank's withdrawal from the takeover battle for Midland Bank. Hutchison
Whampoa dropped 40 cents to HKDollars 19.00 on unconfirmed rumours that it
will soon have a rights issue. Cheung Kong relinquished 60 cents to
HKDollars 25.90.
SINGAPORE eased, with the Straits Times Industrial index dipping 3.14 to
1,500.58 in turnover of some SDollars 54.8m.
TAIWAN, which rose in early dealing, closed down on balance after
profit-taking. The weighted index lost a net 21.57 at 4,565.04.
NEW ZEALAND saw lacklustre trading that was not helped by the closure of
Australian markets. The NZSE-40 index slipped 2.60 to 1,572.30.
JAKARTA rose on foreign buying of selected blue chips. The Jardine Fleming
index gained 1.56 to 68.22. The market is shut today for the general
election.

FT  09 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan falls after rise in
Lombard rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH most of the Continent closed for the Whit Monday public holiday, Milan
and Madrid were the main players on a stage darkened by last week's Danish
referendum 'No' vote, writes Our Markets Staff.
The focus for Euro Disney shifted to London where the shares finished down
20p at 1083p. Analysts said that trading was thin as many investors waited
for Paris where Euro Disney's shares lost 5 per cent on Friday.
MILAN was also depressed by rises in banks' base rates following the Bank of
Italy's increase in Lombard rate last Friday, and confused by another
blackout of the bourse's screen trading system which left volume thin after
last Friday's L99.5bn.
The Comit index fell another 6.34, or 1.3 per cent to 481.08. The 35 shares
listed on the computer system started trading by traditional open outcry at
1100 GMT after the screen system collapsed due to a technical failure. Heavy
rainstorms and lightning put the screens out of commission a week before.
Fiat fell L52 to L5,230, and shed another L50 to L5,180 on the kerb. Banks,
and other industrials lost ground, and selling of Ferruzzi's Eridania
dragged the food sector down by 3.15 per cent, Eridania savings shares
losing L280 to L5,410. Traders said that domestic Italian investors were
selling to raise liquidity for the upcoming Stet new issue.
The day's special situation was Alenia, the Italian partner in the troubled
European defence jet fighter consortium, which plunged L130, or 7.7 per cent
to L1,550 on Germany's lack of political will to stay with the project.
MADRID remained cautious with the post-Maastricht vote still weighing on
sentiment. However, the market may gain impetus on Friday with the release
of CPI data. The general index lost 0.84 to 253.80 in low turnover of
Pta5.7bn. Endesa bucked the trend, rising Pta25 to Pta3,680, on speculation
that RWE of Germany is interested in building a 10 per cent stake.
ISTANBUL was encouraged by positive May inflation figures published after
the close on Friday. The 75-share index gained 198.7 or 6 per cent to
3,462.05.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Millers worried about supply of
bread-making wheat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH MILLERS fear they could be forced to import substantial amounts of
bread-making wheat following the reform of the European Community's common
agricultural policy.
Simultaneously there is a danger that UK feed wheat exporters could lose the
competitive advantage that has led to 4m tonnes of exports a year, according
to the National Association of British and Irish Millers.
'We could be in the ludicrous position of UK millers importing bread making
wheat while UK growers and merchants are unable to export feed wheat which
has lost its competitive edge,' said Mr John Murray, director general of
Nabim, yesterday.
Bread-making wheat has declined to 20 per cent of the UK harvest. With a
perfect harvest this almost meets the millers' requirements of about 3.2m
tonnes. The attraction of growing UK bread-making wheat, which fetches a
premium, has declined. Feed wheats give yields per hectare up to 15 per cent
more than bread-making wheats but their guaranteed price in the intervention
system is only 5 per cent lower.
Outside Britain, support has been effective at a common wheat level because
the yield differential between bread-making and feed wheat is less and
favourable climatic conditions for quality grain are more predictable. The
UK market has been supported at the feed wheat level.
Nabim believes that following CAP reform, it is vital that intervention
should be not be based on feed wheat alone - as many other parts of the UK
cereal sector are arguing. If the EC goes for a feed-based support system
there will be a strong incentive for farmers to go for high yield varieties,
which will reduce the amount of UK bread making wheat grown while increasing
the amount of feed wheat available for export. 'The wrong intervention
system poses a considerable risk on both sides of the equation,' says Mr
Murray.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Peru attempts to give mine
sector a 'competitive edge'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW Peruvian mining law aims to attract much-needed private investment
into the country's deeply recessed mining sector. The supreme decree,
published as a separate supplement to the official government gazette,
liberalises mining activity in all respects and forms the legislative
framework for all mining activity in Peru, one of the world's top mining
countries.
In essence, the law draws together previously scattered legislative
initiatives to curb the traditionally interventionist role of the Peruvian
state and guarantee foreign investment.
Mr Demetrio Patsias, vice-minister for energy and mines, said the law was
intended to 'give Peru a competitive edge over our nearest neighbour,
Chile.'
One new incentive concerns the guaranteeing of tax stability for investors
starting up operations yielding between 350 and 5,000 tonnes a day, or
involving investment of at least Dollars 2m. They will be able to sign
10-year tax stability contracts with the Peruvian state, shielding them from
any taxes the government may create in the future.
The tax 'drawback' system to allow recovery of taxes paid to the Peruvian
state is extended to all exporters. It previously applied to Peruvian silver
producers only.
In another change long demanded by the sector, mining companies will now be
liable for taxes only on profits rather than total sales.
The Peruvian state has traditionally viewed mining as a 'milch cow' and
taxation has been swallowing up as much as 20 per cent of all revenue from
sales - with the result that only four companies in all Peru turned in
profits last year.
The minimum area for a mining concession has been reduced to 100 hectares
(240 acres) and concessions will be granted in multiples of this minimum
unit. Administrative procedures are also streamlined. Joint ventures are
permissible under the new law in any and all areas of mining activity.
Existing legislation guarantees foreign investors freedom to remit profits
and dividends without any restriction or prior authorisation. Foreign
exchange is guaranteed and mining exporters are entitled to the best
available rate.
The new law appears to be intended as a timely forerunner to an avalanche of
state sell-offs scheduled for coming months. The government has committed
itself to privatising all its vast but under-developed mining wealth.
New legal dispositions defining exactly how debt papers may be used in
coming privatisations are expected within days.

New York COTTON futures were sharply higher at midday on prospects of severe
damage to the Texas crop caused by recent heavy rains. 'The earlier cotton
planted in Rio Grande Valley and central Texas is standing in water, and in
the Lubbock area, a vast amount of the acreage has been damaged by the cool,
wet weather that visited the state again over the weekend,' an analyst said.
'At this time it appears the severe damage will amount to more than a
million acres.' The rains are delaying the Texas WHEAT harvest, sparking
concern over the crop's quality and helping to push prices higher in Chicago
by midday. More rain is expected this week in the southern Plains. NICKEL
rallied from earlier six-month lows on the LME in the afternoon but the
market still closed down. The decline mostly reflected speculative selling,
with sell stops hit below Dollars 7,200 a tonne for three month metal.
Analysts see the market remaining under technical pressure, with Dollars
7,050 the key downside objective. The momentum of three month ALUMINIUM's
move below Dollars 1,330 last week was continued, with sell stops triggered
when prices breached Dollars 1,320.

THE WORLD'S two biggest copper mines, located in Chile's Atacama desert,
were bracing themselves for a further spell of bad weather and possible
production losses yesterday as storms that lashed central Chile at the
weekend moved north.
The warming of the cold Humbolt current off Chile's Pacific coast has
provoked violent storms in the centre and south of the country and brought
rainfall to the Atacama - which is reputed to be the driest desert in the
world. The storms have closed Valparaiso, Chile's biggest port, and left
18,000 people homeless.
At Chuquicamata, the world's biggest open-pit mine, an official said that
three hours of rain last Thursday had caused a slow-down in operations. He
denied, however, that mining had come to a halt, as certain news reports
suggested.
Chuquicamata, owned by the state copper corporation Codelco, produces about
6 per cent of the world's copper - 641,429 tonnes last year. Reports of the
alleged shutdown lifted copper prices last Friday.
Managers at La Escondida, the second-biggest copper mine in the Atacama
desert, said that snow and strong winds had forced miners to adopt extra
precautions but that production had not been affected last week. La
Escondida, owned by BHP of Australia, RTZ of the UK and a group of Japanese
smelting companies, produces the equivalent of 320,000 tonnes a year of
refined copper in the form of concentrates.

FT  09 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Williams Holdings taps US
institutions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON

<TEXT>
WILLIAMS Holdings, the UK industrial group, has raised Dollars 175m
long-term debt from a placing of bonds with US investment institutions.
The placing is the latest in a series by UK companies keen to tap sources of
debt finance away from the syndicated bank credits market. Other companies
to have raised funds from US institutions this year include Pilkington,
Lucas Industries and Harrisons &amp; Crosfield.
Last month, British Aerospace raised Dollars 200m five-year funding from an
issue of bonds under SEC rule 144a, which created a hybrid public/private
debt market. The rule allows borrowers to place tradeable bonds with
recognised investment institutions and exempts them from many of the
reporting requirements applied to issuers of public securities.
The BAe bonds were priced to yield 104 basis points over US Treasury paper
and were placed with a group of more than 20 institutional investors. The
issue, made under the issuer's medium-term note programme, was lead-managed
by Goldman Sachs.
Like most other UK corporations, Williams Holdings opted not to use rule
144a. The group placed bonds privately with seven institutional investors in
a deal lead-managed by Wertheim Schroder.
The debt is structured in four tranches, with maturities between 10 and 20
years. At the shortest maturity, the paper was priced to yield 110 basis
points more than US Treasury paper. The 20-year bonds yield around 145 basis
points more than long-dated treasuries.
'We see this as an alternative to equity funding rather than short-term bank
debt,' commented Mr Brian McGowan, chief executive. 'This style of long-term
funding allows us to plan ahead.'
Mr McGowan said the proceeds of the issue would be used for expansion,
probably to fund small acquisitions in the US and Canada.

FT  09 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Italy's foreign debt under
review by Moody's
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S foreign debt has been placed under review for possible downgrade by
Moody's, the US rating agency, following the uncertainty surrounding the
future of European monetary union. Around Dollars 21bn of foreign debt is
affected.
Just under a year ago, Moody's downgraded Italy's long-term debt from
triple-A to double-A1. The debt is rated double-A plus by Standard &amp; Poor's,
the other leading credit rating agency.
Moody's cited two main reasons for the review: the continuing growth of
Italy's debt burden, and the difficulties of overcoming fiscal problems.
Fiscal packages in 1991 only succeeded in holding the public sector deficit
at the same level as in 1990 (10.7 per cent of gross domestic product),
while income and expenditure trends suggest the deficit will continue to
grow as a percentage of GDP.
'It may be increasingly difficult to reverse the underlying fiscal trends,'
Moody's said. Italian interest rates are expected to rise on doubts over the
progress of monetary union, following Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht
treaty.
The fragmentation of the Italian parliament following April's elections will
also make the consensus needed to cut the deficit even harder to find.
News of the review prompted Italian debt prices to weaken. Spreads of
Italian Eurobonds widened by about five basis points relative to the US
Treasury market. Italy's 9 5/8 Eurobonds due 1999, for example, widened to
40 basis points over the curve.
Outstanding bonds are suffering from some decline in liquidity as Italy has
not tapped the international bond market in over a year, relying instead on
its domestic bond market.

<TEXT>
CREDIT Lyonnais Rouse, the futures arm of the French bank, has launched the
first fund in Hong Kong authorised by the colony's Securities and Futures
Commission.
A second fund, from ED &amp; F Mann, the futures fund specialist, has also been
authorised.
The strong appetite for speculative investments in Hong Kong has fostered
hopes that futures funds may find an enthusiastic investor base. The
official authorisation means the funds can be marketed directly to Hong Kong
residents.
The SFC last month published detailed guidelines, containing both disclosure
and structural regulatory requirements, for futures funds seeking
authorisation.
'In Hong Kong, there does appear to be a demand for investment products that
might involve a high degree of risk,' commented Mr Robert Nottle, chairman
of the SFC. 'The SFC is of the view that it is preferable for such demand to
be channelled into authorised funds that carry fund risk disclosure and
other investor protection requirements than to be channelled into areas
where there is no regulation.'
The fund, CLR Select Futures Fund, has also been authorised in Luxembourg
and Germany, and is being examined by the Australian authorities. Credit
Lyonnais Rouse already manages Dollars 24m in existing futures funds.
ED &amp; F Mann's MAP II fund is managed using quantitative techniques; its
predecessor, MAP I, raised Dollars 18m. Mann has a total of Dollars 1.1bn
under management in futures funds.

FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Canadian utility finances
turbines deal through FSC
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HYDRO-QUEBEC, the Canadian power utility, has become the first company
outside the aircraft industry to finance a capital equipment purchase
through a US Ownership Foreign Sales Corporation (FSC).
The Montreal-based utility used an FSC - a complicated form of tax-sheltered
leveraged lease - to acquire four gas turbines, worth USDollars 90m, from
General Electric of the US.
The participants declined to give precise details and terms of the turbines
deal, which was concluded just over a month ago. The idea was the brainchild
of Babcock &amp; Brown, a New York investment bank, and CCG Equipment, an
equipment-financing company based in Barbados. CCG's shareholders are a
number of US and Canadian financial institutions, including Confederation
Life of Toronto.
Capstar Partners, a New York-based boutique run by a group of former
investment bankers, acted as Hydro-Quebec's financial adviser.
FSCs first made their appearance two years ago, and have subsequently become
a popular vehicle for foreign airlines to lease US-made aircraft. Some 75 to
100 FSC deals are expected to be completed this year.
The main difference between an FSC and a lease is that the former requires a
sale outside the US. A Foreign Sales Corporation, which functions as a
subsidiary of a US company, is usually incorporated in an offshore tax
haven.
Financing is provided jointly by equity investors and lenders. The equity
participant benefits from lease payments as well as the straight-line
depreciation of the asset on its books. The lender is paid a negotiated
interest rate.
In the case of the Hydro-Quebec turbine contract, the equity investor is a
subsidiary of the Bank of New York. CCG Equipment provided the debt finance.
Mr Claude Germain, Hydro-Quebec's director of financing management, said the
savings were enough to cover the unusually high legal and manpower costs and
still produce an 'interesting' saving compared with other forms of finance.
Hydro-Quebec turned to an FSC as part of a strategy to diversify its funding
sources.

FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Japanese companies post Y2,237bn
non-operating loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE companies' non-operating profits were squeezed by losses on
securities investments, the decline in cash-flow and the rise in interest
payments due to increases in short and long-term borrowings.
According to Wako Research Institute of Economics, 1,086 leading companies,
excluding financials, listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange, posted a combined
non-operating loss of Y2,237bn (Dollars 17.64bn) in the year ended March
1992.
The non-operating balance reflects profits and losses from financial items
such as interest and dividends and gains and losses through financial
investments. Wako said the combined non-operating balance, which had risen
for eight consecutive years since fiscal 1982, declined for the second year
in a row.
The sharp rise in Japanese share prices in the late 1980s and access to
cheap equity-linked financing led Japanese companies to rely on
non-operating profits to boost pre-tax profits.
But the stock market slump has forced many companies to post losses on stock
investments, and cash-flow declines due to sharp falls in operating profits
have eroded non-operating balances at most manufacturers.

FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Attempting to waken a slumbering
Greek giant - Management efforts to improve services and win back corporate
clients at National Bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Bank, the sleeping giant of Greek banking, is being prodded awake
by a new management team.
The three state-run commercial banks dominate Greek banking and National
Bank, with assets of around Dollars 28bn (60 per cent of total banking
assets), is much the biggest player. It has a network of 550 branches and is
well placed to benefit from the deregulation.
The debit side is that National Bank's proportion of non-performing loans is
high following decades of government-influenced lending, it is overstaffed,
and expertise in several specialised banking areas is in short supply.
The stimulus for change eventually came from within the government. The
Finance Ministry, which acts as proxy for an unwieldy group of state
organisations that control the bank, appointed a team of younger managers,
several of whom had worked abroad or with foreign banks in Greece.
The new governor, Mr Michael Vranopoulos, has a mandate to restructure the
bank's operations to compete effectively in the single European market. 'In
management terms, we have to catapult the bank from the 1950s to the 1990s.
We have to improve services and win back corporate clients. Our big problem
is that we have a lot of business which nobody else wants.'
An example of this is that National Bank handles almost all state pension
fund contributions and payments. It also acts as paymaster for several
hundred thousand employees of public sector corporations.
The bank's first step towards reform was to admit the extent of bad credit,
by abandoning the practice of accruing interest on doubtful loans. It
reported a loss of Dr12.3bn (Dollars 64m) for 1990, its first negative
results in living memory.
Last year, National Bank almost doubled its capital base through a Dr36.6bn
preferential rights offering and a Dr120bn convertible bond issue. Most of
the bond issue was taken up by the government.
At the same time, the bank set up a new subsidiary (National Capital) in
order to syphon off weak assets such as bad loans, low-yielding shares,
property and subsidiaries awaiting privatisation. So far, assets of Dr35bn
have been transferred to National Capital. 'It will take two to three years
to weed out the company's portfolio. Then it can be merged again with the
bank,' says Mr Spyros Capralos, a deputy governor.
The overhaul has brought a swift return to profit. National Bank reported
its best earnings of Dr43.1bn for 1991, despite an increase in provisions
from Dr7bn to Dr45.9bn.
Provisions are now equivalent to eight per cent of lending and will be
increased again next year, according to Mr Vranopoulos. This is partly
because the bank has exposure to a group of nationalised industrial
companies whose debts will have to be written off before they can be
privatised.
National Bank is adopting an aggressive lending policy, taking advantage of
deregulation of interest rates. The bank's computer system is being upgraded
to bring on-line all but a few branches on remoter Aegean islands. About 100
automated teller machines have been installed around Athens and in major
tourist resorts and 300 more are planned.
National Bank's overseas operations, set up to serve Greek immigrants to the
US, Canada and South Africa, are also being reviewed. 'It's no longer enough
to help a Greek migrant send remittances home. The overseas units must start
competing in their local markets,' says Mr Stefanos Vavalidis, who has the
task of upgrading the bank's 67 subsidiaries and branches abroad.
There is still a long way to go. Despite its improved results, National
Bank's return on assets remains negative.
The government promises to introduce legislation this year to abolish the
Finance Ministry's proxy. 'The bank needs to be much more independent of
government. The new law is a priority,' says Mr Vranopoulos.

FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: No-frills investment banker
stays ahead of the game - The new chief executive at Alex Brown, the
Baltimore-based securities house
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LUNCH at the oldest investment bank in the US is a modest affair. There are
no thick-carpeted dining rooms, nouvelle cuisine dishes or stunning
Manhattan views when you break bread with the top brass at Alex Brown &amp;
Sons.
This is not surprising, considering the firm is based in Baltimore, not New
York. Despite its venerable age and blue-blooded history (it was founded in
1800), Alex Brown does not put on Wall Street's airs and graces.
Over a simple chicken salad in a basement boardroom, Mr Buzzy Krongard, the
firm's ex-marine chief executive, dispenses maritime metaphors with abandon.
'The skill is in rigging our ship so that we are prepared to take maximum
advantage when the wind picks up behind us,' he says.
Mr Krongard is alluding to Alex Brown's strong performance in 1991 and so
far this year, when the company exploited handsomely its position as one of
the country's most experienced investment banks at taking new companies to
the stock market.
In the past year and a half, and especially in the last 12 months, US
companies launched initial public offerings (IPOs) of their stock in
unprecedented numbers. The rush was spurred by strong demand from investors
for equities and record-breaking share prices, which persuaded
capital-hungry companies the time was right to raise funds for refinancings
and expansion.
Many of the newcomers were from the young, fast-growing industries such as
healthcare, biotechnology development and computers - of the type that Alex
Brown had a decade of experience in bringing to the market. With so many
companies in their specialist industries going public, Alex Brown reaped the
benefits of the IPO avalanche.
Of the Dollars 24.3bn raised in IPOs last year, Alex Brown accounted for
Dollars 5.9bn in 38 separate issues, making it the leading IPO house in the
nation (when deals are measured by full credit to lead manager). The
strength of the IPO business lifted the company's profits to a record
Dollars 52m in 1991. Its return on equity of 26.5 per cent was the
second-best in the industry.
In the first quarter of this year, however, Alex Brown's share of the IPO
business shrank. In the opening three months it lead-managed just seven IPOs
valued at Dollars 410.3m. The chief explanation for the drop-off is that the
industries which the company specialises in had a difficult quarter.
To counteract the ups and downs of the IPO world, the company relies on its
retail broking, asset management and (to a lesser extent) mergers and
acquisitions businesses.
On the retail side, Alex Brown has just under 400 brokers, whose average
annual production of Dollars 420,000 each in 1991 was the best in the
industry. Alongside its retail broking operations, there is a growing asset
management business. Last year, managed assets rose 19 per cent in 1991 to
Dollars 47.6bn, and the company is currently adding new products and
services (fixed-income and environmental funds, for example) to bolster that
growth.
Alex Brown is keen to build up its M&amp;A business, but it is sticking to its
specialist industries. Mr Mayo Shattuck, the 37-year-old president, says the
company hawks its industry, not its M&amp;A, expertise to prospective clients.
Alex Brown has been fortunate that the decline in M&amp;A has been offset by a
boom in financial restructurings, especially in the pre-packaged bankruptcy
business. 'The beauty for us is that we weren't involved in screwing up
those companies in the first place,' says Mr Shattuck.
Part of Alex Brown's corporate restructuring business includes its new bond
trading operation in New York.
Unlike former days when the fixed-income desk acted like an island within
the company, it will be a fully integrated part of the investment banking
division, focusing on the high-yield end of the bond market. Another new
area is US/Japanese cross-border transactions, especially joint ventures.
Alex Brown has been able to pursue new ventures because of some welcome
stability at the top. It is a relatively new phenomenon. In 1989, after
running into financial difficulties, the management of Alex Brown shifted
from chief executive Mr Hebb to a power-sharing committee of three - Mr
Hebb, the chairman, Mr Griswold, and Mr Krongard.
The experiment with the 'chief executive triumvirate' proved a disaster, and
Mr Hebb eventually stepped down in late 1990. There followed a
morale-sapping seven-month search for a new chief executive, undertaken
against the background of an unsettling power-struggle between the old
retail broking professionals and the young turks of investment banking and
capital markets.
It was not until Mr Krongard's appointment as sole chief executive in July
last year that peace and stability was restored.
Today, with earnings at record levels and the ship sailing along nicely, the
chairman can joke about it all. 'Everyone at the time talked about an old
guard and a new guard,' says Mr Griswold.
'Well, today there is only one guard, and that's Buzzy Krongard.'

Argentine airline
</HEADLINE>

   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPANISH and Argentine government officials are expected to hold talks this
week in an attempt to break the deadlock between Argentina's transport
department and Iberia, the majority shareholder in Aerolineas Argentinas,
the privatised Argentine carrier.
Tension between Iberia and the government began almost immediately after 85
per cent of Aerolineas was sold to an Iberia-led consortium in November
1990.
However, the dispute took another turn last week when the Argentine
government, which retains a 5 per cent stake in Aerolineas, rejected the
company's draft 1991 accounts at the annual meeting.
An Argentine government representative and a representative of the
employees' stock participation scheme, which holds 10 per cent of the
airline, angrily objected to an item reportedly stating the company's
liabilities at about Dollars 670m, most of it due to some Dollars 390m in
debts run up by the company's new owners.
The owners have secured the debt with seven Aerolineas aircraft, even though
the government claims this is forbidden under the sale contract.
The government sold Aerolineas free of all liabilities, but now finds the
company has incurred heavy debts, apparently taken on to pay for the deal.
Aerolineas was sold for Dollars 260m and a further Dollars 2.01bn in a
debt-for-equity swap. Neither the government, Aerolineas or their auditors
Arthur Andersen were available yesterday for comment.
The sale of Aerolineas, Argentina's second privatisation, was troubled from
the start. A dispute among shareholders forced Iberia and other investors
based in Spain to take a majority stake in the airline. A subsequent dispute
with the Argentine government over the precise amount due in payment further
increased tension.

THE PENTAGON has lifted a ban on awarding new contracts to General
Electric's aircraft engine division, just four days after it imposed the
punishment over GE's involve-ment in an Israeli bribery scandal, writes our
New York staff.
The Pentagon's Defence Logistics Agency said it had lifted the ban because
of GE's rapid response to the government's con-cerns about the management of
the engine division, including an agreement to more government oversight of
the operations.
According to a suit being prosecuted by the US Justice Department, officials
in GE's aircraft engines division were involved in kickbacks to Gen Rami
Dotan of the Israeli air force to help insure equipment sales to that
country.

FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hongkong Bank's O&amp;Y exposure set
at Dollars 787m
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank, one of the largest single creditors of Olympia &amp;
York, the troubled Canadian property developer, said yesterday its total
exposure to the company was Dollars 787m.
In an unusual move, Hongkong Bank issued a statement 'in view of recent
press speculation' about its exposure to O&amp;Y. It rebutted suggestions it was
a large lender to the Canary Wharf development in London, saying it had an
exposure to that project of less than Dollars 9m.
The bulk of the bank's advance to O&amp;Y had arisen from its participation in a
Dollars 2.5bn syndicated loan to Olympia and York Resources Credit Corp, the
bank said.
The syndicate effectively has a first charge over O&amp;Y's 71 per cent stake in
Gulf Canada Resources and 82 per cent interest in Abitibi-Price, a pulp and
newsprint manufacturer.
The current 'loan-to-market value ratio' of these two assets was around 66
per cent, the bank said. This suggests that Hongkong Bank might have to
provide up to Dollars 270m if the underlying assets were sold at current
values.
However, the bank said it may recover the principal of the debt in the long
term.
Meanwhile, Hongkong Bank anticipated making a specific provision for the
loan, the size of which is yet to be determined. The provision would be
written off against this year's profits.

IN THE rural surrounds of western Japan, executives of Kobe Steel and Texas
Instruments last week celebrated the completion of the world's latest
semiconductor plant, a monument to US-Japanese co-operation in electronics
and to Japanese steel companies' diversification programmes.
At the same moment, back in Tokyo, representatives of the two countries'
chip industries were haggling over foreign market share in Japan.
These squabbles were not heard by the celebrants gathered in a
gaily-decorated local hall at Nishiwaki, whose mayor thought it appropriate
that the factory was finished just as the world semiconductor market had
taken a turn for the better.
The mayor appears to have been looking at the wrong spread sheets. Prices
for the memory chips to be produced at the Y55bn (Dollars 429.7m) wafer
fabrication plant in its first phase of operation have been in steep decline
for the past year, and the industry is still characterised by excess
capacity and weak demand.
But Kobe Steel likes to see itself as different to other Japanese
steelmakers, whose electronics ventures have generally soaked up enormous
amounts of investment and returned little in profits.
And Kobe remains confident, even though established Japanese electronics
companies are reviewing their ailing chip operations, which were partly
responsible for profit falls ranging from 43.1 per cent to 68.6 per cent in
the year to the end of March.
Mr Sokichi Kametaka, president of Kobe Steel, said the joint venture
company, KTI Semiconductor, in which his company has a 75 per cent share,
will accelerate Kobe's 'diversification into the mainstream' of the
electronics industry.
'The semiconductor field is seen as an area with strong growth and is
expected to have a very positive impact on the Kobe Steel group,' Mr
Kametaka said.
Japanese steelmakers are looking for the positive in a year in which steel
demand is slowing and diversification projects are in difficulty.
Kobe can point to a 15.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits last year: that
was below the 45 per cent drop at Sumitomo Metal Industries, the 37 per cent
fall at Nippon Steel and the 25.5 per cent decline at NKK.
NKK, Japan's second-largest steelmaker, has just released a review of its
long-term management plan that re-emphasises the importance of the core
steel business, and concedes that new business areas are likely to
contribute less to profits than previously forecast.
In a previous plan, drafted in 1988, NKK reckoned that new business would
account for 25 per cent of annual sales by the year 2000 - that figure has
been revised down to 16 per cent. Engineering business is expected to
account for 31 per cent of sales, up from the previously forecast 25 per
cent, and steel for 53 per cent, instead of 50 per cent.
Kawasaki Steel, which has a joint-venture chip factory with LSI Logic of the
US and its own plant, said last week that its recruitment of semiconductor
staff has been capped. By the year 2000, Kawasaki hopes, optimistically,
that chip sales will be Y200bn, or about 10 per cent of total sales.
However, the Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ) senses that
the traditional chipmakers and the newcomers, such as Kobe and Kawasaki, may
have got their numbers wrong.
The EIAJ last week warned companies not to expect a repeat of the rapid
market growth of the late 1980s, and advised them to develop new products,
while refraining from 'excessive' investment in increased capacity for
memory chips.
In opening a plant two days after the EIAJ advisory, Kobe Steel is counting
on the upturn in demand that the entire industry has sweated on for the past
year.
Meanwhile, US industry officials hinted last week that they were content to
leave the crowded memory chip market to Japanese and Korean companies, while
themselves concentrating on customised chips and microprocessors.
KTI is planning to start production in the autumn with a new generation of
16Mbit memory devices. But the company is unsure whether there will be
sufficient demand, for example, from makers of work stations, for these
high-capacity chips and whether the venture will have to turn to the present
generation 4Mbit chips in order to ramp-up the fabrication facility.
After gathering expertise from memory chip production, the facility will be
turned over to application-specific chips for consumer and industrial
electronics. These items tend to have smaller production runs designed to
suit customer requirements, and KTI hopes there will a queue of such
customers.
Kobe Steel began diversifying well ahead of the competition, and steel now
accounts for only 48 per cent of total sales, with machinery, aluminium and
copper products comprising most of the remainder.
The shift into electronics began in late 1987 with the establishment of
Genesis Technology (GTI), which provides testing services for chips.
If not actually providing much steel 'synergy', the new Nishiwaki plant does
have a certain political synergy. The finished products will be marketed
through Texas Instruments and counted as foreign semiconductors in the
Japanese market and, in a small way, perhaps ease trade friction with
Washington.
For the US company, which already has four plants in Japan, Kobe Steel's
enthusiasm for electronics provided an opportunity to share the considerable
costs of a new facility. Mr Jerry Junkins, TI's chief executive officer,
told the people of Nishiwaki that 'with many other demands for resources on
us in other parts of the world, it was desirable to seek a partner for this
additional effort in Japan'.

AVON Products, one of the world's largest manufacturers of cosmetics and
toiletries, is planning to cut around 1,000 jobs by 1994 - a move which the
company says will help reduce annual operating costs by around Dollars 40m,
writes Nikki Tait in New York.
At end-December, the New York-based company employed around 30,500 people,
one-third of whom were in the US and the rest overseas.
The announcement came as Avon said it was shutting down a manufacturing
operation in Alcala de Henares in Spain. This will eliminate around 140
jobs.
Avon, which has operated in Spain for almost three decades, will retain a
local headquarters and distribution centre in Alcala de Henares, but will
supply the Spanish market from manufacturing facilities in the UK, Germany
and Italy.

<TEXT>
BIOCHEM Pharma, Glaxo's Canadian partner in the development of the 3TC
treatment for the Aids disease, has withdrawn its first international equity
offering of 3.5m new shares because of a sharp drop last week in the market
value of its existing stock.
The company said it could not explain the drop in the share price from a
52-week high of CDollars 35 to below CDollars 20 in North American markets.
Clinical trials of 3TC, conducted by Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group,
are 'progressing well' and preliminary information is scheduled to be
released at next month's International Aids Conference in Amsterdam.
BioChem maintained that its financial position was strong, with net cash
exceeding CDollars 30m (USDollars 25.2m).
This position is expected to be enhanced by new capital from warrant, option
and equity subscriptions amounting to around CDollars 40m during the rest of
the company's financial year.
British and continental European interest exceeded the target 1.75m new
shares that were to be sold in Europe.
BioChem will proceed with full listing on the London Stock Exchange later
this year, and Kleinwort Benson has been named its global financial adviser.
BioChem is working on a number of new products for detection, prevention and
treatment of diseases. The company also makes vaccines and diagnostic kits.
Magna International, Canada's biggest independent car parts maker, is
raising a further CDollars 103m in new equity by a public issue of
subordinated voting shares at CDollars 32.25 each.
The proceeds of the issue will be used to reduce debt.

GENERALI, Italy's biggest insurance company, moved a step back towards its
central European roots with the signing yesterday of an accord to establish
an insurance company in Romania. It will be working with the country's
co-operative movement.
Trieste-based Generali was a important force in the insurance business in
eastern and central Europe before the communist takeover. The group, which
is one of the largest insurers in Europe, already has an operation in
Hungary.
Generali is the first western insurer to return to the Romanian market. The
new venture, to be called Generala Asigurari - the same name as Generali
traded under until its activities were nationalised in 1947 - will be 51 per
cent-owned by Generali. It should be operative by the start of next year.
Its local partners in the venture, which it expects will run both life and
non-life lines, are three co-operatives in the retail and financial sectors.
The new insurance company will be able to use over 1,000 outlets of the
co-operative movement, which has been active in Romania for over 140 years,
and is an important part of the country's economic life.
Generali gave no indication of how much it was investing in the venture.

FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: French insurers' man of
influence builds a network - UAP chairman Jean Peyrelevade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN leading figures in French finance were asked to name the most
influential figure in their field, Mr Jean Peyrelevade, chairman of Union
des Assurances de Paris (UAP), the biggest of the big French insurers, was
top of the list.
Mr Peyrelevade says he is unimpressed. 'It's of no interest to me at all,'
he said, puffing contentedly on one of his favourite Havana cigars in his
opulent office.
However, as he is well aware, influence is important in the incestuous world
of French commerce. Mr Peyrelevade owes his post at UAP to his standing with
the ruling socialists; he was a senior aide to Mr Pierre Mauroy when the
latter was prime minister.
Mr Peyrelevade is making the most of his political connections as UAP - and
the other two state-controlled insurers, Groupes des Assurances Nationales
(GAN) and Assurances Generales de France (AGF) - prepare for partial
privatisation possibly early next year.
Partial privatisation, where the French government will sell minority stakes
in the insurers, reducing its own holdings to as low as 51 per cent, comes
at a sensitive time in the industry.
The French insurers have just announced lack-lustre results for 1991, when
they were hit by the economic slowdown and the problems of the Paris
property market, where they are significant investors. UAP itself saw net
profits slide by 11 per cent, from FFr4.22bn to FFr3.77bn (Dollars 690m), on
turnover of FFr155.3bn.
'We are operating in a very competitive market, and in some sectors there is
too much pressure on prices,' said Mr Peyrelevade. 'Contrary to what a lot
of people say, I don't believe that things will be better in 1992.'
The medium-term outlook, he believes, is brighter, particularly in life
insurance, which ought to benefit from the forthcoming expansion of France's
private pension system.
In other sectors, he said, companies like UAP may have to 'risk losing
market share in order to protect profitability by bringing prices up to
reasonable levels again'.
In the meantime UAP, like the other French insurers, is concentrating on
augmenting its European network. It is already established as Europe's
second largest insurance group - after Allianz of Germany - with significant
interests in the UK, Belgium, Italy, Spain, Greece and the Netherlands.
'Our European coverage is satisfactory now with one or two exceptions,' said
Mr Peyrelevade. One exception that he 'eventually' plans to address is the
UK, where UAP hopes to diversify into non-life insurance.
However, the immediate priority is Germany, the largest European insurance
market, where UAP's presence is negligible.
Mr Peyrelevade sees Colonia, the German insurer controlled by Victoire, a
French insurance group, as UAP's key to the German market. UAP owns 34 per
cent of Victoire which is, in turn, controlled by the Suez group, of which
Mr Peyrelevade was once chairman.
Mr Peyrelevade has, for months, been negotiating to swap part of UAP's
Victoire shares for a stake in Colonia.
So far Suez has held out. Some analysts suspect it is making the most of its
negotiating power to try and strike a hard bargain. 'UAP is desperate to get
into Germany and all it has to bargain with is a minority stake in
Victoire,' said one analyst. 'UAP is over a barrel and Suez knows it.'
The backdrop to the negotiations with Suez - which Mr Peyrelevade will not
comment on - is the dialogue with the tial privatisation. Mr Peyrelevade
says it is up to the government to decide the terms of the forthcoming share
sales. It has to decide the amount of equity involved and whether the
companies themselves will be able to raise capital.
Behind the scenes, however, he, and the heads of the other large insurers,
have been eager to express their opinions.
Mr Peyrelevade sees partial privatisation as the next logical step in the
development of the French public sector. Although he is committed to the
concept of state investment in industry, as an advocate of a mixed economy
he sees the state's role as lending stability as a 'long-term investor'.
In its turn, he says, state-controlled companies, such as UAP, should lend
stability to the private sector companies in which they have invested.
Despite his support for state ownership, Mr Peyrelevade has argued for
changes in the relationship between the government and the companies it
controls. He believes the state's shareholding should be reduced. The 51 per
cent minimum permitted under the new partial privatisation rules will 'do
for the next few years', he says. In the longer term, however, he envisages
the state reducing its investment until it becomes 'an ordinary minority
shareholder'.
By then, he argues, the other vestiges of state control - notably its right
to appoint the heads of companies, like himself - should have disappeared.
'The same people would probably end up in charge,' he said, with the
confidence of a man convinced he would have risen to the top whatever the
system. 'But at least other shareholders would have their say.'
In the meantime, the critical question for UAP and the other French insurers
is whether they will be able to raise capital for themselves in the
forthcoming share sales. Even as ardent a mixed economist as Mr Peyrelevade
identifies the inability to raise capital - because of the constraints of
state ownership - as a disadvantage for public sector companies such as UAP.
He also recognises that it may have deterred some potential partners, if
they were unwilling to work with a state-controlled concern.
UAP is, for instance, locked out of the US market, where publicly-owned
companies are not allowed to invest in local insurers.
So far, Mr Peyrelevade claims, it has not been a large problem. 'After all,
we have become Europe's second largest insurer by expanding from our own
resources,' he said. 'But in the long term, unless we can raise external
capital, we could suffer in comparison with our international competitors
like Allianz.'

FT  09 JUN 92 / International Company News: Groupe Bull arm to launch 40
models in strategic overhaul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ZENITH Data Systems (ZDS), the US-based personal computer arm of Groupe Bull
of France, will today announce the most radical changes in corporate and
product strategy since it was established 13 years ago.
The changes, which have been planned over the past 18 months, are designed
to return ZDS to profitability in a market where prices are collapsing and
many suppliers are chasing too few customers.
They will also indicate that ZDS is once again a force to be reckoned with
after a period in which it seemed to have lost drive and direction.
The announcement, to be made in Paris by Mr Enrico Pesatori, ZDS president
and chief executive officer, will include the launch of 40 new computer
models in five families. All have been developed by ZDS since the personal
computer manufacturer was acquired from Zenith Electronics Corporation in a
controversial Dollars 500m deal three years ago.
It will mean that ZDS' entire line of notebook, desktop and network-server
computers will be revamped overnight. It will claim industry leadership in a
several areas, including portability, battery life and pricing.
'We have a new corporate look that includes everything from our products to
our logo,' Mr Pesatori said. 'ZDS is a whole new company.'
The company, a pioneer in portable computers, has been losing money since
the Bull takeover. Mr Pesatori agreed it would not be profitable in the
half-year to the end of June.
The success of ZDS is critical to Bull, which is hoping it will provide up
to 40 per cent of overall revenues by 1994, compared with about 20 per cent
now. ZDS currently turns over more than Dollars 1bn; Bull, about Dollars
6bn.
As part of a deal made this year with International Business Machines, ZDS
will manufacturer 150,000 notebook computers a year to IBM's specification.
A key part of the new strategy is to segment the product line, offering
separate families of machine to the cost-conscious and to the professional
computer user.
The important low-cost sector of the market is being addressed by large
manufacturers. Compaq, a leader in high performance machines, will soon
launch its first inexpensive models; IBM has formed a wholly-owned
subsidiary in Europe to sell inexpensive computers sourced from Asia.
Mr Pesatori said company strategy was now based on four principles: simple
ways for customers to upgrade their machines as technology advances; simple
ways to connect them together; simple ways to use the computers; and elegant
and ergonomic design.
Critics argue that despite the quality of build and design, the new Zenith
machines are essentially the same technology and price as other machines on
the market. Mr Pesatori says, however, that customers will increasingly
choose well known names over cheap, anonymous brands.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Chesterfield Properties shows 48% fall to
Pounds 6.7m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS of Chesterfield Properties fell by 48 per cent, from Pounds
12.78m to Pounds 6.7m, in the year to end-December.
The company attributed the decline to the ending of capitalisation of
interest charges on the completed Five Acre Square and Rochdale
developments.
Turnover rose from Pounds 35.3m to Pounds 38.6m and comprised Pounds 33.9m
(Pounds 27.9m) from rental income, Pounds 30,000 (Pounds 1.9m) from property
dealing and Pounds 4.62m (Pounds 5.45m) from cinema, theatre and other
activities.
The annual revaluation of the group's investment portfolio showed a deficit
of Pounds 91.6m. This included a further provision against Chestergate
House, a development property.
The net asset value per ordinary share fell by 47 per cent from 1,017p to
534p, or by 41 per cent from 965p to 572p fully diluted.
Mr Roger Wingate, chairman, said the principal cause was the collapse of
rental values in central London. The group's West End portfolio fell by 25
per cent, and the City and Southwark properties by 37 per cent.
In the case of the City,this was aggravated by the continuing 45 per cent
vacancy at Five Acre Square. Provincial properties performed better, he
said, the downward movement being 3.5 per cent for shops and 2.5 per cent
for offices.
The interest charge (including capitalised interest) showed a slight fall
from Pounds 26m to Pounds 25.3m. Profits after tax and minorities showed a
modest rise from Pounds 3.7m to Pounds 3.9m, mainly as a result of a lower
tax charge.
Earnings per share came out at 12p (10.83p) or 17.17p (16.24p) fully
diluted.
The final dividend is maintained at 11.5p for a same-again total of 18.5p.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Hotfoot it down to the Pounds 85m airport
mall - A look at BAA's plan to earn more from retailing than airport charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BAA, the former British Airports Authority, is gradually transforming itself
into a giant shopping emporium.
Sir John Egan, chief executive, sees in retailing one of the most promising
growth opportunities for his company's airports. About Pounds 85m has
already been earmarked for retail expansion at BAA airports over the next
four years.
And although traditional airport operations including take-off and landing
fees and other airline related charges now make the biggest single
contribution to BAA revenues, Sir John expects retailing to grow steadily in
importance.
'By 1993-94 BAA will earn more from retailing operations than from actual
aeronautical charges,' he forecast.
Aeronautical charges last year accounted for Pounds 363.2m of BAA's total
Pounds 909.3m revenues, whereas income from commercial operations amounted
to Pounds 277m. This included Pounds 137.7m from duty and tax free shops and
an additional Pounds 25.2m from book stores and other specialist airport
shops as well as income from a host of other commercial services.
During the last eight months, BAA has opened 27 new retailing outlets at its
airports and by the end of this year the total is expected to rise to 90 new
outlets. 'By 1996, we will have increased floorspace by over 400,000 sq ft
at our airports, virtually double the 1991 level.'
Intensive market research by BAA and airlines indicates that passengers like
to shop at airports, said Sir John.
'This is borne out by the fact that even during the recession when high
street retailers felt the pinch, we were able to increase the spend per
passenger.'
Shoes are one of the consumer items in biggest demand at BAA airports. The
Bally shoe shop in Heathrow's Terminal 3 will achieve a turnover of more
than Pounds 3m this year, selling more per sq ft than any other shoe store
in the UK.
BAA sees significant opportunities for further growth in retail sales at its
airports not only from new passengers but also from existing users who
currently do not buy at airport shops: only 32 per cent of the 72m
passengers who used BAA airports last year shopped at BAA stores. Sir John
also believes his company can substantially increase the current Pounds 6
average spend per passenger at its airports.
Higher income from retailing operations will help to offset expected
reductions in traditional aeronautical charges as a result of the Civil
Aviation Authority's new pricing regime governing traffic charges at BAA's
London area airports.
The new five year regime limits BAA London airport traffic charges - which
include those levied at Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted - on a formula of
retail price inflation (RPI) minus eight for both this year and next year,
RPI minus four the following year and RPI minus one for the two subsequent
years.
Sir John said the formula would lead to a reduction in income from airport
charges of Pounds 25m this year rising to Pounds 50m next year.
This would also make the charges at BAA airports among the lowest in the
world - and they are already at the bottom end of the European league,
according to an annual review of charges at 40 leading international
airports published yesterday.
The study, prepared by the Travers Morgan Consulting group, shows that the
five most expensive airports in terms of aeronautical charges are three in
Germany (Berlin, Frankfurt and Munich), Tokyo and Vancouver.
Heathrow and Gatwick featured in the lower half of the index, coming in at
21 and 27 respectively.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Betterware cleans up with 75% improvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BETTERWARE's advance on the doorsteps of the UK continued unabated last year
as the household goods company increased pre-tax profit by 75 per cent.
The figure rose from Pounds 4.02m to Pounds 7.04m, on sales up 44 per cent
to Pounds 41.7m, in the year to February 29. The Pounds 322,000 cost of
buying in franchises was treated as an exceptional item.
Mr Andrew Cohen, chief executive, said growing sales had provided more
opportunities to make economies of scale. For instance, the catalogue cost
the same to print as it had five years ago, even though it had increased
from 64 to 108 pages.
The group was continuing to improve its coverage of the UK market. 'The
right mix would be to have one distributor for every 1,000 households. There
are 21m households, so there should be 21,000 distributors. At the moment we
have 7,000.'
In general, direct sales showed strong growth as a shopping medium in the
UK, where the average annual spend on this form of shopping was only Pounds
32 per household. This compared with Pounds 48 in France, Pounds 88 in
Germany, Pounds 93 in the US and Pounds 250 in Japan.
Betterware launched a French operation last September at a cost of Pounds
250,000. Sales were increasing, but it was not expected to contribute to
profit until next year.
Earnings per share rose to 12.2p (7p). A final dividend of 2.21p makes a
total of 3.06p (2.325p). A 3-for-2 scrip issue is proposed.

every year is some way short of saturation in the UK. And the more sales it
gets, the better the deals it can do - especially during a recession - with
the printers of the catalogue and the makers of the goods. High unemployment
has also made it easier to recruit 'distributors' - the army of
self-employed people who do the door-to-door runs. The only capacity
constraint to emerge has been in the warehouse and Pounds 9m will be
invested over two years on a new one near Birmingham which will more than
double annual capital spending. Questions for the future include the
potential for overseas growth. France should break even this year, but it
will be some time before it becomes clear whether this operation has taken
off. Meanwhile, decisions will be made on whether to go into Italy, Germany
or Spain. Pre-tax profit is expected to grow by at least 40 per cent this
year to more than Pounds 10m. This gives a prospective p/e of more than 19
on yesterday's close of 336p. The share price has shot up from 54p two years
ago and 133p last June, but the stock is still worth holding. The scrip
issue and any reduction of the Cohen family's 60 per cent stake should
improve liquidity.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Banks reluctant to put property assets in
receivership says survey
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS ARE reluctant to put property assets into receivership because of
fears of large falls in their value, according to a survey of leading
insolvency practitioners conducted by English &amp; Overseas Properties.
In a sample of 30 accountancy firms involved in property receivership work,
80 per cent said banks were shying away from liquidation and choosing to use
accountants more as managers than sellers of assets.
The views come in spite of the recent use of insolvency procedures taken by
banks in a number of high-profile property projects including the
administration of Canary Wharf in London's Docklands.
But they echo concerns about Heron Corporation, Mr Gerald Ronson's property
and finance company, currently seeking to re-schedule its debts. It had its
property portfolio down-valued from Pounds 1.3bn to Pounds 1bn in April.
Some 90 per cent of the practitioners questioned in May believed the number
of properties entering receivership would continue to rise.
Half think property prices are starting to level off in the UK, but another
40 per cent expect further declines over the coming months.
Only 60 per cent were spending money to improve buildings in their charge so
that they would retain their value, and they often met considerable
resistance from creditors' committees in raising additional funding for this
purpose.
The appointment of property managers to help enhance the value of properties
in their charge was considered by 60 per cent of the firms, and the majority
accepted they needed to seek professional assistance when carrying out their
work.
Half said that marketing techniques to sell property assets could be
improved, although 80 per cent established marketing and advertising budgets
to help in disposals.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: EFM Japan launch to raise Pounds 20m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDINBURGH FUND Managers is seeking between Pounds 15m and Pounds 20m from
the launch of a Japanese investment trust.
EFM Japan will come to the market via an institutional placing and offer to
intermediaries, and becomes the third geographical specialist investment
trust to be launched this month, following trusts investing in Europe from
Henderson and Thornton.
However, Europe appears to be popular with private investors at present,
while Japan, following recent heavy falls in the Nikkei-Dow index, is less
fashionable.
EFM has also bucked a recent trend for complex split-capital issues by
opting for a conventional structure - there will only be ordinary shares,
plus warrants issued on a 1-for-5 basis.
Mr Iain Watt, EFM managing director, said he was confident that the trust
would not move to a discount to net asset value and pointed out that
Japanese investment trusts managed by Baillie Gifford, Robert Fleming, and
GT were all trading at premiums.
He said EFM was keen to add to its range of investment trusts, and already
had two unit trusts investing in Japan - EFM Smaller Japanese Companies and
EFM Tokyo - which were fourth and 54th respectively in the 60-strong sector
of Japanese unit trusts over the five years to June 1, according to Finstat.
Mr Watt said the offer was aimed at institutions and private investors. He
was confident there would be considerable interest. 'Japan remains a dynamic
economy with excellent recovery potential.'
The ordinary shares of 25p will be issued at 100p while the warrants will be
exercisable from 1993 to 2005 at that price. The trust will be open for
subscription between June 15 and June 23. First dealings will be on June 30.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: A question of management achievement -
Strength of leadership is central to the future of Dowty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS the witching hour for Mr Bruce Ralph, chief executive of Dowty, the
ailing aircraft landing gear and information technology group.
By 1 o'clock tomorrow shareholders will have decided whether to reject the
hostile Pounds 510.8m bid from TI Group or to give Mr Ralph another chance
to turn the company around.
If they accept the offer, Dowty will join Hawker Siddeley on a growing list
of famous British engineering names swallowed by acquisitive conglomerates.
TI, for its part, will join the FT-SE 100 index, becoming the UK's
second-largest engineering group behind British Aerospace, and the sleepy
atmosphere that some argue has settled over Cheltenham's largest company
would be rudely blown away.
As tomorrow's deadline approaches it seems that TI is heading for victory,
even though institutional shareholders are not convinced the price is a
knockout blow.
Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman, could not have struck at a worse time
for Dowty, struggling as it was to restructure a recession-hit aerospace
business.
Not only was Dowty forced to report dreadful interim figures last year when
it was already one of the most frequently tipped takeover targets. The
company also failed to spend enough time preventing analysts from further
downgrading their full-year forecasts earlier this year.
When, during the bid, Dowty reported full-year profits of Pounds 29m, some
40 per cent above expectations, the City was reluctant to accept the figures
or the company's claims about recovery.
With the bid coming only two months into its financial year, Dowty has also
effectively been prevented from issuing a profits forecast for this year, a
weapon which target companies consider one of their most effective defences.
Almost certainly Dowty will enjoy a substantial profits recovery this year,
not only because of higher anticipated orders for aircraft and spares. In
the year since Mr Ralph took over, Dowty has slashed costs, reducing the
workforce in the aerospace division by 27 per cent and cutting the wage bill
by an estimated Pounds 50m.
Some of this will benefit Dowty this year. But the company, its advisers
Lazards, and its brokers Cazenove, have not felt they can forecast the
strength of the recovery this early in the year.
In the last week, Dowty was forced by the takeover panel to distance itself
from whispers that it would make pre-tax profits of Pounds 50m this year,
significantly higher than market expectations.
Had Dowty been sufficiently confident to make such a forecast, TI's 188.3p
share offer and 175p cash alternative would have started to look less than
generous. As it is, Dowty's shares yesterday closed at 176p, down 4p.
Price is not however the deciding factor in this bid. Dowty will maintain or
lose its independence over the question of management.
Here Dowty not only has problems with its own record. Mr Ralph is also
trying to repel an increasingly well-respected management team. Mr Lewinton
may raise eyebrows in some corners of the City with his chunky executive
compensation packages or some of his accounting practices, but shareholders
do not argue with the way he has turned TI around.
In the six years since taking over at what used to be called Tube
Investments, Mr Lewinton has transformed the bicycles and kettles company
into an international sales and pipes business and has, until last year,
consistently grown earnings per share.
Dowty by comparison, clearly has not given its shareholders earnings growth.
While recession in aerospace has been partly to blame, the fatal blow may
well prove to have been the ill-timed expansion of its Information
Technology division under Mr Tony Thatcher, the previous chief executive.
Mr Ralph has recognised the mistake and Information Technology is up for
sale - either by an independent Dowty or a victorious TI.
But try as he may, Mr Ralph has failed to distance himself entirely from
responsibility for Dowty's expensive detour from engineering.
As a result Dowty has consistently found that a lack of management
credibility over the longer-term future has been a difficult obstacle to
overcome.
While institutions appear to like Mr Lewinton's record, they have not been
as impressed in terms of aerospace industry logic by the prospect of a
TI/Dowty marriage.
At best, analysts agree, Dowty's landing gear, propeller and avionics
division and its polymer engineering division would complement TI's
aerospace engineering and John Crane sales businesses.
From TI's point of view, however, the acquisition of Dowty makes strikingly
good sense. It would add a third business leg to Bundy International pipes
and John Crane, each with sales of about Pounds 400m. And it would give TI
critical mass internationally in the two areas, thereby reducing exposure to
cyclical markets.
These markets are likely to recover this year but not perhaps enough to
reverse last year's decline in earnings growth. Dowty, as one might expect,
claims that TI actually needs another acquisition to resume earnings growth
as there is evidence of only a meagre historic contribution from organic
growth.
Mr Lewinton rejects this argument but admits the engineering industry will
remain difficult. 'It is going to be a long, steady, grinding climb,' he
says.
What Dowty's shareholders appear to have decided is that they would like Mr
Lewinton and not Mr Ralph to lead that climb.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Thomas French in Pounds 1.2m acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thomas French, the decorative accessories supplier, has bought British
Trimmings' curtain tape making business for a maximum Pounds 1.2m cash.
The company also announced interim pre-tax profits of Pounds 299,000,
against Pounds 329,000.
The acquisition achieved unaudited gross profits of Pounds 695,000 on
turnover of Pounds 2.09m in the year to February 29. The consideration was
satisfied by an initial payment of Pounds 1.1m and a further maximum Pounds
100,000 depending on stock valuation and cost cuts.
Sales for the six months to March 31 fell from Pounds 7.12m to Pounds 6.38m
reflecting the recession and the impact of discontinued businesses. However,
Mr Jeremy French, chairman, said that margins were maintained.
Earnings per share came out at 1.47p (1.63p); the interim dividend is held
at 1.45p.

<TEXT>
IFG Group, the Dublin-based financial services concern, is paying Pounds
2.25m to First National Leisure Services for the First National Trustee
Company, which provides trustee and administrative services to the leisure
industry from its base in the Isle of Man.
IFG, traded on the USM, reported pre-tax profits for the 1991 year down from
IPounds 1.6m to IPounds 1.09m (Pounds 997,000). Turnover was higher at
IPounds 4.85m (IPounds 3.33m).
The consideration will be satisfied by Pounds 1m cash and the issue of
redeemable preference shares in IFG Ventures, an Isle of Man offshoot. To
part fund the cash element 2m shares have been conditionally placed to raise
IPounds 440,000.
In addition IFG is issuing a warrant for 1.5m shares exercisable in five
years at 30p a share to FNLS.
The profit was struck after an exceptional charge of IPounds 237,000 and was
said to be satisfactory in the difficult market conditions. Earnings per
share were 3p (4.82p) and an increased single final dividend of 1.05p (1p)
is proposed.

DECREASED SALES in the UK, France and Italy caused Acal, the USM-quoted
electronics and industrial control equipment wholesaler, to turn in sharply
reduced pre-tax profits, from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 2.78m, for the year to
March 31.
Total sales were down at Pounds 58.5m (Pounds 59.7m) and operating profits
declined to Pounds 3.49m (Pounds 5.06m).
New business acquisitions contributed Pounds 3.2m to sales.
The purchase of the Waycom electronics components business had a negative
impact on profit in the last quarter, but should contribute to profits next
year following reorganisation.
Earnings per share came out at 14p (20.5p) and a final dividend of 3.9p is
recommended, making an increased total of 5.85p (5.4p) for the year.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Henderson lifted to Pounds 17m despite 6%
fall in funds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HENDERSON Administration, the fund management group, yesterday announced
pre-tax profits of Pounds 17m for the 12 months to March 31, an increase of
7.3 per cent on the previous year.
This was achieved despite a 6 per cent fall in funds under its management.
However, directors said that 'the outflow has now slowed down', while the
subsequent strong post-election performance of UK markets had provided a
'useful boost' to funds under management.
They said the upswing in investor confidence following the general election
would boost their business, and Henderson was considering further
acquisitions and joint ventures to follow the establishment of Henderson
Venture Managers, which manages unquoted investments, and its 25 per cent
stake in Sabre, a futures manager.
Mr Jeremy Edwards, group managing director, said: 'I do see us acquiring
other fund management businesses if they would be a good fit with us and if
the price is right.'
Investment performance had improved slightly, despite the fall in the
overall value of funds under management.
The company hopes to use this to bid for more pension fund management
business, an area where it lost revenue following poor investment
performance in 1987 and 1988.
Operating expenses were reduced slightly, from Pounds 33.9m to Pounds 33m,
allowing a 40 per cent increase in operating profit from Pounds 7.23m to
Pounds 10.1m.
A final dividend of 28.5p (27.5p) is recommended, to give a total of 41p, up
from 37.5p the previous year.
Earnings per share were 54.3p, up from 49.7p.
Henderson's share price dropped on the news, falling from 760p to 745p.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: 29% pay rise for Sainsbury's top director
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The remuneration of the highest paid director of J Sainsbury, the food
retailer, increased by 29 per cent to Pounds 280,000 in the year to
mid-March. The company would not comment on the identity of the recipient.
It said that there had been a number of retirements and appointments to the
board over the year. The total remuneration for directors rose by about 16
per cent, less than the rise in profits and dividends. Pre-tax profits of
Pounds 628m were 21 per cent higher. Dividends, at 8.75p, rose 20.4 per
cent.
Sainsbury said it aimed to pay directors well in relation to their
responsibilities but not to give vast increases or pay large bonuses as a
result of small increases in profits.
Lord Sainsbury, the chairman, who retires in November, saw his remuneration
rise from Pounds 189,000 to Pounds 221,000.

Pounds 2.41m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRONIC DATA Processing, the expanding Milton Keynes-based computing
services company, is reaping the benefit of its decision to focus on
software at the expense of hardware with interim profits well up on City
expectations.
Despite a near-14 per cent fall to Pounds 7.47m in revenues for the half
year to March 31, profits before tax rose 29 per cent, from Pounds 1.87m to
Pounds 2.41m.
EDP has emerged as one of a small band of computing services companies which
has not only managed to raise sales and profits through the recession but
seems set to continue its growth. Mr James Warhurst, analyst with Henry
Cooke Lumsden, EDP's broker, anticipates profits of Pounds 5.2m this year
and Pounds 6.2m next. Last year profits totalled Pounds 4.08m.
Earnings per share rose 28 per cent to 18.83p (14.69p) and an interim
dividend of 2p (1.75p) is declared.
The company has cash balances of Pounds 11.3m and is actively seeking to
acquire software companies with products compatible with its own range.
However, an agreement earlier this year to buy Applied Computer Systems, a
Manchester-based private software house, has been abandoned. Mr Richard
Jowitt, managing director, said he had been dissatisfied with the
representation of ACS' assets.
EDP's principal products are the Mentor line of supermini computer systems
and Merchant, a software product developed for the wholesale distribution
industry. Services revenues, representing maintenance contracts and software
licence fees, were now more than Pounds 8m a year or more than 50 per cent
of revenues.
Mr Jowitt said the company would later this year release a software product
aimed at environmental management which he expected to make a considerable
contribution to revenues and profits.
Trading conditions remained depressed, he added, but he expected to maintain
a healthy position in the second half.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Liberty board contests Concerto Capital
plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOARD of Liberty has thrown its unanimous weight against the proposals
of Concerto Capital Corporation, the vehicle of South Africa's Myerson
family, to change the fashion retailer's share structure - 'to enfranchise
every shareholder', in the words of Mr Brian Myerson.
In a circular ahead of the extraordinary meeting on June 26 requisitioned by
Mr Myerson, Liberty directors said Concerto's proposals would not enhance
the marketability of Liberty shares. They reminded shareholders that the
ordinary shares had outperformed the FT-A Stores index by 147 per cent and
the FT-A All-Share index by 131 per cent since Mr Harry Weblin became
chairman in August 1984.
In the same period earnings per share and dividends had grown by an average
compound rate of about 20 per cent per year. Mr John Pugh, finance director,
said the board 'was confident of support'.
Mr Myerson said Concerto would be issuing a rebuttal of the company's
points. He contended that the figures were misleading because of the rise in
the share price since Concerto bought its 15.03 per cent stake of the voting
shares from the Merchant Navy Officers Pension Fund. He also said that, if
taken over a five year period, dividend cover had declined from 5 to 2.9
times and earnings per share had fallen from 21p to 20.77p. The circular
'fudged the enfranchisement issue,' he claimed.
Currently the 'inner' Stewart-Liberty family has 35 per cent of the voting
rights and the 'wider' Blackmore and Moffatt families between 15 and 20 per
cent. Liberty's share structure is 70 per cent voting and 30 per cent
non-voting.
Mr Myerson's proposals include the sub-division of the non-voting shares
with half given voting rights. Ordinary shareholders would be compensated by
a 1-for-2 scrip issue. Liberty said that this creation of three different
classes of shares would lead to a reduction in investment interest.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Coal deal provides spark for results - A
look at expectations as the electricity companies report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a hard world when a 40 per cent increase in your pre-tax profits does
not merit so much as a raised eyebrow.
But the electricity industry has resigned itself to the fact that its
results season, starting today, will attract less interest than its
negotiations with British Coal.
For the regional companies, which are due to announce pre-tax profits for
the year to March 1992 up by an average of over 40 per cent, the diversion
may come as something of a relief.
As it is, the increases are bound to attract some political attention. Mr
Frank Dobson, the shadow energy secretary, is always quick to condemn the
privatised companies for rewarding investors not customers.
He has already pounced on the 15 per cent increase announced by Scottish
Power last month, which he believes conceals a higher growth rate if
exceptional items last year are discounted.
The regional companies' dividend growth will also be high.
It is expected to average between 12 per cent and 13 per cent nominal and
about 7 per cent in real terms, considerably higher than last year.
'I think there may be a worry that over-egging the pudding could bring
regulatory attention and worries for investors, especially if some companies
go even higher this year,' said Mr Richard Leveritt, finance director at
Eastern Electricity.
However, the electricity regulator has so far shown little sign of being
concerned about dividend levels.
Meanwhile, the season begins with the two generators' results, which are not
expected to be anything like as spectacular.
PowerGen's pre-tax profit should be up by about 25 per cent to 30 per cent
at Pounds 340m-Pounds 350m, giving earnings per share of 29.5p to 30.5p,
with a dividend up about 10 per cent at close to 9.2p.
National Power is likely to report pre-tax profits between Pounds 500m and
Pounds 515m, for earnings per share of 28.8p to 31.5p and a dividend also up
about 10 per cent to 9p.
Operationally, the main issue is likely to be costs. Both companies have cut
manpower substantially - National Power now has 11,400 employees compared
with 17,000 when it was floated.
But now that the row over whether the generators were manipulating the
electricity pool or wholesale market has died down, attention is bound to
return to the coal deal on the basis that it says far more about the
electricity industry's future than last year's figures.
That is partly because the regional companies' dramatic profit growth is due
to a technical blip.
The companies were unable to increase their prices enough in the year to
March 1991, because of formulae put in place by the government at flotation
which linked prices to inflation forecasts which turned out to be
significantly too low.
They compensated in the year to March 1992 by sharp price increases, which
are largely responsible for this year's profits.
Electricity sales have grown by only about 1 per cent on average, with far
stronger growth in the south. And although the regional companies continued
their cost cutting programmes, some, notably Eastern Electricity and Manweb,
are expected to report losses in electricity supply, the low margin bulk
purchase and sale of electricity.
This is partly because 'uplift', the administrative charge they pay to the
pool, increased sharply during the year.
It is concerns about this supply business, and the regulatory issues that
surround it, that underlie the regional companies' concern about the coal
deal.
The regional companies are the kingpin of the deal between British Coal and
the electricity industry that the government needs before it can privatise
British Coal.
Although it is the two generators who buy British Coal's product, they have
to be able to sell it on as electricity to the 12 regional companies, who
are at present unwilling to take it.
This is because they have been warned by the regulator, who protects
customers, that they must supply power as economically as possible, or face
penalties later. And in 1994 the regulator is due to review the basis of the
regional companies' power purchases. At the moment, whatever they pay can be
passed on to customers. But the signs are that after 1994 the regulator will
not allow them to pass on costs which exceed an industry average or some
other yardstick.
The regional companies are thus nervous about signing a large, long-term
coal deal without a nod from the regulator.
And when there is no sign of any surprise in the core business, the extent
to which the companies' long-term future is still overshadowed by regulatory
issues is bound to attract more City attention.
When it comes to the generators, the importance of the coal deal issue is
more simple.
'Once the contract is settled the performance of the generators will be more
predictable,' said Mr John Baker, chief executive of National Power. The
contract is likely to cover about half the generators' income, for a period
of up to five years.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: 3i cuts its involvement in US venture
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
3I, the venture capital group which is preparing for a stock market
flotation later this year, has withdrawn from active involvement in the US
venture capital market because of poor returns.
The company, which is the largest venture capital company in the UK, has
stopped making later-stage investments in the US. It will provide follow-on
finance to the 40 companies in its Dollars 70m (Pounds 38m) US portfolio but
will not make any new investments.
The move follows the announcement in the middle of 1991 of its decision to
spin off 3i Ventures, its US start-up and seed capital investment company.
3i transferred its early-stage portfolio to Aspen Venture Partners, a new
venture management company in which it was sole general partner.
3i said then that it would provide extra funds to Aspen Ventures to allow it
to make follow-on investments taking the total capitalisation of the
portfolio to Dollars 150m, made up of investments in about 80 companies.
'We won't lose money over there but the returns won't be as good as we would
have wished,' said Mr Neil Cross, managing director of international
investments. 'We did not have a huge business in the US but the recession
went on and on.
'The decision to de-emphasise the US was part of the continuing process of
looking at all our activities.'
3i had not made a secret of its decision, said Mr Cross. Its 1991 annual
report said it planned to limit the resources provided to US investment
capital and reduce its involvement in the early-stage, high-technology
market. But the scale of its withdrawal from the US market has not been
widely appreciated in the UK.
3i has always emphasised the international nature of its activities and two
years ago formed a joint venture with Industrial Bank of Japan to provide
funds to small and medium-sized Japanese companies.
The Japanese project is still at an early stage but is going well, Mr Cross
said. It has made investments in 60 companies.
The emphasis of 3i's overseas activities is now in continental Europe. It
has operations in France, Germany, Spain, Italy, and, through associate
companies, in the Netherlands and Portugal.
New US investments amounted to Pounds 28m in the year ended March 1991. All
overseas investments were Pounds 93m out of total new investments of Pounds
382m.

FT  09 JUN 92 / UK Company News: WPP faces shareholder revolt over
refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WERE signs yesterday that WPP, the marketing services group, faces an
uphill struggle to persuade holders of convertible preference shares to
accept the refinancing proposal announced on May 13.
County NatWest, which is acting for UK institutions holding some of the 213m
convertible shares, claimed that more than 38 per cent of convertible
holders opposed one of the proposal's key elements, concerning the
compulsory conversion to ordinary shares. County Natwest said that other
institutions were also likely to oppose the scheme.
Under the proposal, convertible holders would be required to convert to
ordinary shares at a ratio of 0.588 - about four times the existing terms.
However, in recent months securities dealers have increased trading in the
convertible shares, giving the market prices of the two shares an average
conversion ratio of 0.46.
County NatWest said yesterday that some institutional shareholders are
seeking a conversion rate closer to 1:1.
WPP said its proposed conversion rate was not negotiable. The group has
other options if the proposal is rejected, including the formation of a new
company, which would be listed in order to raise the Pounds 150m equity.
WPP is seeking an equity-debt exchange with its banks, under which the banks
would subscribe to a Pounds 150m rights issue in exchange for some 25 per
cent of the group's Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m) debt.
The proposal is being considered by WPP's syndicate of 28 banks. WPP
confirmed yesterday that the Bank of New York and ASLK, the Belgian bank,
are seeking to sell WPP debt, at a discount, to secondary traders. BNY hopes
that WPP will approve re-assigning its debt, of some Dollars 85m, to Goldman
Sachs and others. However, this could jeopardise the proposal's acceptance
with the rest of the syndicate.
Yesterday, National Westminster, which owns County NatWest, stated to the
Stock Exchange that at close of trading on June 2, it held, via County
NatWest, more than 17m WPP convertible shares, giving it 6.3 per cent of
voting rights. The statement came after WPP had instituted a search of its
share register.

FT  09 JUN 92 / BAA year-end profits tumble 22%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLUGGISH air travel growth coupled with large property provisions and
restructuring costs sent pre-tax profits at BAA, the UK airport operator,
tumbling by 22 per cent to Pounds 192m for the financial year ending March.
But the performance was generally well received by the City: BAA shares
yesterday closed 14p up at 679p in a weak market.
The pre-tax profits and an 11.5 per cent dividend rise were at the top end
of City expectations.
The company announced a final dividend of 8.75p making a total for the year
of 14.5p compared with 13p last year. Sir John Egan, BAA's chief executive,
said the dividend increase reflected the company's growth expectations in
the next two years.
Excluding property and restructuring provisions, pre-tax profits were
slightly lower at Pounds 283m compared with Pounds 284m the year before.
Earnings per share were 19 per cent lower at 30.6p but excluding provisions
they were up 5 per cent at 46.3p.
The company made Pounds 55m provisions to cover the downturn in the property
market and a further Pounds 36m for voluntary staff redundancies which led
to the reduction of 2,000 jobs during the financial year.
The company's Lynton property subsidiary made a net loss of Pounds 53.5m and
its hotel activities also made a net loss of Pounds 22.9m.
BAA's core airport operations performed better than expected in a difficult
market hit by recession and the impact of the Gulf conflict on air travel
last year.
Sir John said traffic was showing signs of recovery. BAA expected annual
growth of between 5 per cent and 8 per cent this year over last year's
depressed levels settling down to around 4 per cent in the longer term.
Total revenues rose 9 per cent to Pounds 909m. The number of passengers
using BAA airports was unchanged at 72m.
Heathrow, the company's flagship, saw a 2 per cent traffic increase with 42m
passengers, reflecting liberalisation of London's air traffic rules. In
contrast, the liberalisation depressed activity at Gatwick, which suffered a
7.6 per cent fall in passengers to 18.9m.
Stansted, opened last year and BAA's only unprofitable airport, saw a 70 per
cent traffic increase to 1.9m passengers.
Sir John confirmed plans to hold down the cost of building a fifth terminal
at Heathrow to less than Pounds 900m instead of earlier estimates of around
Pounds 1.6bn.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Heron to meet bond interest payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property group which is negotiating
with its banks and bondholders over the rescheduling of Pounds 1.3bn of
debt, said yesterday it did not expect to miss any interest payments on its
bonds.
Interest on the 11 bonds, with a total principal value of Pounds 450m, is up
to date, and payments due later this month will be met, Heron said.
No further coupon payments are due until November, and by then the group
hopes its refinancing will be complete.
An information memorandum is being prepared for bondholders, and is expected
to be sent out next week. This will give some details of a report produced
by KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants, at the banks' request.
The group is proposing to roll up interest payments on some of its bank debt
after its standstill agreement with its 82 banks expires at the end of July.
However, it is understood that the amount involved is not large in the scale
of the group's loans.
Some areas of the group, notably the UK trading operations, are continuing
to generate cash and will meet interest payments on their debt.
However, the group felt that it was inappropriate for parts of the business
which are under greater pressure to make interest payments.
The company and its lead bankers believe that the group can be saved through
an orderly sale of assets over the next few years, whereas a fire sale now
would leave creditors faced with a Pounds 550m loss.
This was the essence of a plan put to bankers in April and was repeated by
KPMG when presenting its report to a meeting of the banks last Friday. This
report is said to have broadly supported the company's own earlier work.
The main difference was one of valuations of the properties. At last
Friday's meeting, chartered surveyors Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks emphasised
that the valuation it provided for the KPMG report, which showed a Pounds
300m lower figure than Heron's valuers had produced for the March 31 year
end, was a 'desk-top' review and subject to the limitations inherent in
that.
Two of Heron's own valuers, which had done a more thorough review of the
properties, said at the meeting that they stood by their earlier estimates.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Personal View: Why Cadbury leaves a bitter taste - Sir Owen
Green, chairman of BTR, responds to the report of the committee on corporate
governance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Sir OWEN GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Cadbury report on the financial aspects of corporate governance begins
with the words: 'The country's economy depends on the drive and efficiency
of its companies.' Certainly, all constructive proposals aimed at improving
that drive and efficiency are to be welcomed. Sadly, the report that follows
is long on accountability but short on drive and efficiency.
The proposals relate almost exclusively to the well-being of investors,
current and potential, who are described as 'owners of the company'. The
report makes several references to their responsibilities as owners, but my
reading of the report suggests that it is more about their rights.
The concept of ownership, as distinct from membership, of a limited
liability company is novel, untested and inappropriate. The expression
'owner' does not appear in the Companies Act, and the normal obligations of
a true owner are, except in respect of unpaid share capital, non-existent.
Perhaps the description has been introduced to stir a perceived apathy
illustrated by the voting habits of members of companies.
The report begins its section on corporate governance by defining it as 'the
system by which companies are run'. It is not: running the company is the
function of the executive. If taken literally, the report's recommendations
would produce a hydra-headed organisation, alien to the aims of drive and
efficiency.
For example, paragraph 4.3 of the report urges that 'if the chairman is an
executive director, a senior non-executive director should be appointed to
take the lead,' presumably against the chairman and his executive
colleagues. This unworthy proposal could easily be avoided by requiring
instead that the chairman should not also be the chief executive. In any
company of size, the roles are distinct and sometimes incompatible.
This is not the only example of the report's belief in committee
paramountcy. Elsewhere, for example, it suggests that the chairman of the
company may no longer be responsible for answering questions at the annual
general meeting about audit matters, even though these are important enough
to require a page and a half of proposals. Yet another chairman/spokesman
may need to answer to the AGM, this time on remuneration.
A more divisive aspect of paragraph 4.3 is the way it strikes at the heart
of the unitary board. It begins by restating the legal position that all
directors are equally responsible for the board's decisions. But the
committee immediately reveals its view of the real purpose of non-executive
directors. They are there to monitor the performance of the board (including
themselves?) and that of the chief executive.
As mentioned earlier, the paragraph recommends the appointment of a senior
non-executive director 'to take the lead, in order to maintain the balance
between executive and non-executive influence'. If the members of the
committee believe in a unitary board, as I do, this is nonsense. If they
seek this kind of segregation, they should have the courage of their
convictions and advocate a two-tier board structure.
There is more double-speak by the committee in paragraph 4.7. It says: 'The
emphasis in this report on the control function of non-executive directors
is a consequence of our remit and should not in any way detract from the
primary and positive contribution which they are expected to make, as board
members, to the leadership of the company.'
This is followed by a series of proposals. None is about leadership; all
stress the difference between the non-executive directors' status and
contribution and those of directors with executive responsibilities. A house
divided, the Bible tells us, cannot stand . . .
Of all the report's recommendations, I think the proposals on audit
committees are the least meritorious, notwithstanding the practice in the
US. This committee, says the report, should be entirely composed of
non-executive directors. It should recommend the appointment of the
auditors, review the company's financial statements, and discuss the audit
with the auditors.
At best, this is sheltering the auditors. It offers a crutch, of no legal
status, to the non-audit committee directors. At worst, it discourages other
members of the board from seeking individual satisfaction in the discharge
of one of the board's primary collective duties: to ensure on behalf of the
shareholders a proper reflection of their governance of the enterprise
expressed in published financial terms.
The arrogance of this imported proposal is communicated through the
committee's own words. The report describes at length the limitations of
auditor's responsibility. Then, in stark contrast, it blandly describes the
unlimited responsibilities of the board for the financial statements. The
striking difference between these two exposures surely requires the most
direct contact between every member of the board and the auditors, rather
than restricting this to a committee - no matter how composed.
The report refers to the competitive pressures, both on companies and
auditors, which make it difficult for auditors to stand up to demanding
boards. This seems to imply that the absolute requirement of an auditor  -
integrity - is regarded, apparently with understanding, as a victim of
competitive pressure. If that is the case, it is surely the auditing
profession which is in need of a committee review.
One other recommendation seems likely to add nothing but length to financial
reports. The committee says that directors 'should state in their report
that the business is a going concern, with supporting assumptions or
qualifications as necessary'. Such qualifications will surely ensure that
all reports contain the going concern statement, rendering its inclusion
valueless.
The report's subliminal message is of the need for total integrity and a
healthy objectivity in company affairs. This is strongly to be supported.
But the need for a code in addition to existing rules and regulations is
doubtful - as is its likely effectiveness in reducing the relatively few
instances of misbehaviour.
I believe that existing laws and regulations are adequate for the purpose of
corporate governance and that the statistically few failures stem from the
quality of the participants rather than the quantity of the regulations.
As the report itself points out, 'raising standards of corporate governance
cannot be achieved by structures and rules alone . . . what counts is the
way they are put to use.' That goes for all laws - but we still have
criminals.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Letter: To lend more than 100 per cent of property value is
dangerous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms CAROL GRANT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'The next step in housing' (June 2), seemed to suggest
that in order to tackle the 'negative equity' problem, mortgage lenders
should be allowed to advance more than 100 per cent of a property's value to
stimulate a recovery in the housing market. This is dangerous talk. Surely
you are not suggesting that we should rely on building societies to lend
their way out of the housing slump?
Mortgage lenders are already suffering the effects of lending a high
proportion - often 95 or 100 per cent - of the valuation on a prospective
home. Indeed, it was this practice that led to the negative equity problem
in the first place.
If anything, mortgage lenders will now be forced into more prudent lending
patterns because of intense financial pressure. Cuts in interest rates, and
concessionary deals to allow those in mortgage arrears to pay lower rates,
are putting pressure on the savings end of the operation.
If the outflow of savings from building societies continues, and funds on
the wholesale money markets prove more expensive as lenders see their credit
ratings downgraded as a result of provision for bad debt, we will see a
credit crunch rather than the expansion of lending you rashly suggest.
Also on June 2 ('Lenders will defend record'), in your coverage of the
meeting between the lenders and the government on mortgage rescue schemes,
you pointed out that 275,000 households are currently in long term mortgage
arrears. You then suggested that, since repossessions had been contained at
about 75,000 last year, 200,000 of these people had therefore been 'saved'
from repossession.
Nothing could be further from the truth. Virtually no one has been saved
through the complex rescue schemes devised with housing associations.
Lenders are containing the problem by accepting lower repayments and by
sitting on a lot of bad debt. When the upturn finally comes, these people
will be the most vulnerable to repossession.
