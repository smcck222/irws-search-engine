FT  09 JUN 92 / When the talk turns to trade: Mexico, Canada and the US are
set to clinch a Nafta deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
A month of intensive negotiations in Mexico City, Toronto and Washington has
brought a North American Free Trade Agreement to the brink of settlement.
Mexico's President Salinas told the FT last week that talks could be over
'in a matter of weeks'. Officials talk not of whether, but of when, a deal
will be struck.
Even though many details of the agreement have not been disclosed, both
Mexico and the US are now confident of net gains from such a regional trade
pact. It would integrate the trade of 350m people in Canada, the US and
Mexico in a region boasting a total gross national product of Dollars
6,000bn. This would make it almost identical to the European Community both
in population and in the size of the economy. A recent study by the
Washington-based Institute for International Economics (IIE) estimates that
it would add an annual Dollars 24bn to trade between Mexico and the US by
1995. It would also provide an estimated 600,000 jobs in Mexico, and give
the US a net employment gain of 130,000, mainly in the services,
distribution and farming sectors.
Unlike Mexico or the US, Canada is equivocal. Its bilateral trade with
Mexico is not large enough for the Nafta to make any significant impact on
its economy. It already has its own free trade agreement with the US, and if
the Nafta in any way erodes the terms of that agreement, there is a
possibility that Canada could walk away. In an attempt to avert this danger,
negotiators agreed last week to seek bilateral deals where three-way
agreement appeared impossible.
For the rest of the world - particularly Asia's fast-growing exporters  -
the Nafta may give cause for concern as US purchases and corporate
investment, are transferred from their economies to Mexico.
Among the most enthusiastic supporters of the Nafta are business leaders in
US states which border Mexico: 'The North American Free Trade Agreement is a
match made in heaven,' says Arizona's Republican congressman Jim Kolbe.
Viewed from Arizona, such a reaction is easily explained: the Nafta would
significantly boost the Dollars 2bn a year trade flows between Mexico and
Arizona, generating jobs in professional and financial services, creating
markets for farm products, and boosting the state's importance as a freight
centre.
Reservations about an agreement exist in northern car industry states like
Michigan and Ohio, and in textile producing states. Both fear that jobs will
be lost to Mexico as companies relocate south of the border. They also fear
that Mexico could be used by exporters in Asia as a springboard into the US
market.
In spite of this north-south division of opinion over Nafta, recent polls
indicate that the economic boost it provides and the jobs created are likely
to be a vote winner for President Bush in the presidential election
campaign. As a result, negotiations have been brought to the front burner,
and lawyers closely involved with the drafting process say few parts of the
agreement remain unsettled.
After the recent bout of negotiations, officials say that several chapters
of the negotiating text have been 'locked up'. These include customs
regulations, industrial standards, principles underpinning financial
services, intellectual property rights, textiles, food safety regulations
and rules controlling land transport.
Close to agreement are tariffs, rules of origin, safeguards intended to
protect domestic industries from import surges and insurance and
telecommunications. There also appears to have been a breakthrough on
Canadian worries about local-content rules for car production.
The main problem areas remain farm trade, government procurement,
particularly at state level and in the construction industry, and energy. On
farm trade, it appears four categories of products have been identified,
with the least sensitive to be freely traded as soon as the agreement is in
place, and the most sensitive retaining protection for between 15 and 20
years. The ultra-sensitive goods - grouped in 'Kika's list' in deference to
Kika de la Garza, the powerful head of the House of Representatives'
Agriculture Committee - are thought to include citrus products, tomatoes,
cucumbers, asparagus and cotton.
On the question of Mexico's reluctance to open its energy sector to foreign
investment, advisers to the negotiators say Mexico has signalled a
willingness to compromise by opening its petrochemical sector, pipelines and
petrol stations to foreign investment.
Depending on the pace of progress on resolving these outstanding issues,
officials are aiming for a ministerial meeting before the end of June that
would initial a final agreement: 'It is within the art of the possible to
have an agreement this summer,' Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade
representative, told the FT in Washington last month.
While the US administration believes an agreement is now within reach there
is still a question about how best to put the deal through congress. There
are not enough days left in the congressional calendar for President Bush to
be able to force a final agreement through before November. He has two
options: either to initial an agreement before the election, and submit it
for congressional ratification in January; or to keep agreement on ice and
push everything through after the election.
The first course would give him more time in the new year to get an
agreement through Congress, but would leave its terms exposed to attack from
political opponents and industrial lobbyists. The second course would avert
the danger of Democrat opponents making political capital out of the
agreement in some states during the election campaign, but would leave the
administration with a rush to present a finalised agreement to Congress
before March 1, when its power of 'fast track' approval of the Nafta
expires.
Mexico's President Salinas, who has been as powerful as President Bush in
pushing the Nafta, has different reasons for wishing to see a deal completed
quickly. It would lock in the economic reforms of the past seven years.
Perhaps more important, the agreement is expected to be a magnet for
urgently needed inward investment. President Salinas's conversion to a Nafta
followed a disappointing tour of Europe at the end of 1989. His ministerial
team received congratulations for the economic reforms they had initiated,
but few pledges of investment. His first overtures to President Bush on a
Nafta came days after he returned to Mexico from his European tour.
The fear of lost export opportunities, and of being starved of investment
funds, have been the main driving forces behind other liberalising countries
in Latin America, who are forming a queue behind Mexico for their own free
trade agreements with the US. Chile, Venezuela and Colombia are close behind
Mexico. Caricom, which groups the Caribbean states, is keen to join the
Nafta. Mercosur, which groups Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay, and
the Andean Pact, which groups Bolivia, Colombia, Chile, Ecuador and Peru,
are close behind.
Mr Sam Laird, an economist at the World Bank, has forecast that a Nafta
agreement without multilateral trade liberalisation would cost Latin
American countries outside Nafta annual exports to the US market of Dollars
222m, as Latin exports to the US would be replaced by those from Mexico.
With wider trade liberalisation, this loss falls to Dollars 21m.
The issue of whether the Nafta would benefit the world trading system or
would divert trade and investment from Asia and Europe is a fraught one.
Economists insist that regional trade agreements do not necessarily threaten
the world's multilateral trading system. But the idea that Nafta might
provide a model for any multilateral trade agreement is overstated, they
say. On the contrary, there are protectionist aspects of the agreement which
will be hard to swallow for countries outside North America:
in textiles, the US and Mexico have agreed a 'yarn forward' deal which means
that all textiles and apparel from yarn through to the finished product must
be of North American origin if they are to win duty free access to the
market.
in the auto industry, vehicles will have to have between 50-70 per cent
local content to avoid tariffs.
while Mexico will drop most tariffs on US imports to zero, it is being
pressed by Washington to maintain its average 9 per cent duties on imports
from other countries. This could make Mexico captive to US suppliers by
giving them an effective 9 per cent price advantage over competitors from
outside North America.
Such protectionist elements could sour the international trading
environment, particularly if the deadlock in the Uruguay Round of world
trade talks is not broken. Nafta could thus become a weapon of regionalised
trade war. In the face of the EC's 'Fortress Europe', Nafta would then draw
the ring fence for 'Fortress America'.
'The risk that regional trade arrangements may turn hostile towards each
other cannot be discounted,' says a recent World Bank report, adding that
this would damage world trade.
Even in Mexico, where the Nafta is important in locking in reforms and
securing access to the US market, there is awareness that a regional trade
agreement is likely to be second best to global trade liberalisation.
In a wider negotiating forum, such as the Gatt, it can join with other
developing countries to maximise negotiating leverage on industrial powers
like the US, Japan or the EC. Alone, and heavily dependent on the US
economy, its negotiating clout is limited.
'It is not easy to have a neighbour in the US,' said President Salinas last
week:
Such concerns are echoed by the IIE report. 'As a smaller trading power,
(Mexico) gains the most from the protection offered by multilateral rules,
and has most to lose if confidence in the multilateral system erodes.'
The US also stands to lose if regionalism undermines the multilateral
trading system. More than 55 per cent of US exports in 1990, totalling
Dollars 393bn, went to Europe or Asia, while less than 8 per cent of exports
went to Mexico. Wider global trading interests mean that the US government
sees Nafta reform as a complement to multilateral trade reforms rather than
an alternative.
While officials are buoyed by progress concerning a Nafta, their ultimate
objective remains a successful conclusion to a stalled Uruguay Round.
Without that, the gains from a regional trade agreement will be compromised
by the prospect of instability, insecurity and possibly global trade
conflict.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Leading Article: A state well worth saving
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of communism has already led to the destruction of two federal
states - the Soviet Union and Yugoslavia. The results of the weekend
elections in the Czech and Slovak Federal Republic suggest that
Czechoslovakia might go the same way. It is a prospect which politicians in
both republics should seek to avoid, and towards which western Europe cannot
remain indifferent.
Czechoslovakia is no longer the 'far away country about which we know
little', left to its fate by Britain and France in 1938. Even then it was
the most successful state in eastern Europe. Now it is a potentially
prosperous associate member of the EC. It should be able to call on the
Community for support at this crucial time, even though the main
responsibility for building a workable federation rests with the
newly-elected Czech and Slovak leaders.
Their principal objective should be to create the economic and political
conditions for Czechoslovakia to become a full member of the EC by the turn
of the century. That way lies prosperity and freedom for both peoples.
The danger that an independent Slovakia would slip back towards the
turbulent 'east', while the Czech lands forge ahead towards EC
compatibility, was recently highlighted by President Vaclav Havel. It is
recognised by a majority of Slovaks who, according to opinion polls, still
prefer to retain some form of link with the Czech lands. Most Czechs are
also in favour of keeping the 74-year-old federation. This reluctance to
break the union must be taken into account by Mr Vladimir Meciar and Mr
Vaclav Klaus, the main election victors, as they start their talks today.
The election results also show that economic policies made largely in Prague
have hurt Slovaks, while Czechs, with more hope for future prosperity, have
given their support to market reforms. These divergent responses reflect
real economic and social differences which have to be recognised and allowed
for.
Mr Klaus agrees that the original policy of halting arms exports and cutting
arms production was nave and damaging to Slovakia. If almost everyone else
is busily selling arms, it is difficult to see why Slovakia should not. He
also recognises that Slovakia's communist-era legacy of dependence on
Comecon markets and heavy industrial bias, as well as distance from EC
markets, make it particularly vulnerable.
But the Czech lands already subsidise Slovakia by more than Dollars 500m a
year. Prague and Bratislava could legitimately team up to ask the EC for
more help.
In recent months, for example, the Kosice steel plant in eastern Slovakia
has found new outlets in France, Greece and other EC markets. Last week,
this led to threats of anti-dumping duties. However politically difficult,
the EC should keep its markets open. It should also provide assistance for
radical improvement in Slovakia's communications with the west. EC funds are
under great pressure, but helping keep Czechoslovakia together should be a
high priority.
Where compromise seems impossible is over the powers of the federal
government. The Czechs are prepared to devolve more powers to the republican
and local governments. But Mr Klaus insists on a common currency, a single
central bank, close co-ordination of monetary and fiscal policy, rapid
privatisation and other market-oriented reforms. Without such powers, it is
difficult to see how a federal state could work, or indeed how the economic
reforms, now starting to show results, could continue.
If no agreement can be reached, both sides may find themselves facing what
they hope will be a 'velvet divorce'. They should beware. Divorces have a
nasty habit of becoming vicious. This is an old, established and hitherto
successful marriage. Each side should be prepared to make the compromises
needed to keep it going.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Housing tenders
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGEMENT of council housing is the latest public service put out to
compulsory competitive tendering. This will be a welcome step for many of
the 9m people living in council homes.
For while some local authorities have a good record of managing their
estates, others have failed dismally. Rent arrears have mounted to Pounds
430m, over 10 per cent of revenue in 29 authorities. The proportion of empty
homes ranges from 0.1 per cent to 9.7 per cent. Too many estates suffer
neglect which would be unacceptable in the private sector.
Compulsory competitive tendering is now the tried and tested way of dealing
with such service failures by exposing them to market competition. Where the
council is operating an efficient and high-quality service, the workforce
has little to fear. In a minority of cases - if other local services are a
precedent - outside firms will take over the management of badly-run
estates. Elsewhere, competitive tendering galvanises poor management and
forces the in-house team to improve its performance.
Contracting-out housing management is, however, more complex than tendering
for services such as street-cleaning. Particular skills are required to
manage badly-built and poorly-maintained estates within the tight financial
constraints councils work under. The allocation of costs between housing
management and other services such as housing the homeless is not always
clear. And dealing sensitively with low-income tenants who are strapped for
cash requires skill and tact.
For these reasons and others, the government is wise to proceed gradually.
It will take time to create a market of competing contractors with the
skills and resources to make a success of managing council estates. One
source of such managers could be councils with a successful track record of
tenant management. The unnecessary bar on councils competing for out-of-area
contracts where it is financially prudent for them to do so should be
lifted.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Strategy to re-sell a tarnished treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you think that following the Danish rejection of the Maastricht Treaty
the British government is up the Rhine without a paddle you are mistaken. It
hasn't much of a paddle, but just what kind of a creek it is up is unclear.
Mr John Major's cabinet is distinctly nervous, but at least it knows what it
proposes to do. There is a broad strategy, which I shall outline in a
moment. It lacks precision but it is more or less coherent. Its principal
defect is that its success or failure will be determined by the actions of
unpredictable tribes, such as the Danes, the Irish, the French, and
Conservative back-benchers.
The strategy begins with the simple proposition that it is the government's
job to prevent other Europeans from going off on their own to enact policies
that deeply affect Britain's interests. To this end the United Kingdom must
be a leading participant in European affairs. It must be welcomed as such by
the continentals. An unwillingness to accept this self-evidently correct
thesis has led to tears and tantrums on many occasions since 1945. Mr
Major's achievement has been to inscribe it upon a banner and hold it aloft
as the driving principle of his government.
It was under this banner that he and his foreign secretary, Mr Douglas Hurd,
worked so hard last year to reach agreement on the shape of a future
European Union. Both of them are certain that Britain does best in Europe
when it argues its case patiently and persistently, and worst when it
appears to be destructive, or leaves an empty chair. They will now work to
save the Maastricht deal. In this they regard themselves as blessed with a
greater sense of what is politically acceptable than the Portuguese, the
French and the Germans, who proposed at a meeting of foreign ministers in
Oslo to tell the Danish electorate to go to hell.
In some moods, it appears, the Danish government would have been rather
pleased with that. Perhaps they think it would browbeat their opponents. Old
hands know better. Mr Hurd persuaded the meeting to produce an emollient
communique. At the same time it was established that (a) Danish voters
cannot be asked to accept Maastricht unchanged, while (b) there can be no
renegotiation.
The question of when a renegotiation is not a renegotiation may trouble
Cartesian minds, but it is the kind of convoluted thought at which the
English excel. One non-renegotiation might be to take the treaty apart, with
the essence of it agreed by all 12 signatories including the Danes while
some bits - foreign and defence policy, say - would be set up as separate
deals among the other 11. The British government is against putting all of
the original treaty into a new Maastricht of the 11. That is 'not on.'
A different non-renegotiation, apparently favoured by Mr Hurd, would be to
try to show the Danes (and the Tories) that Maastricht represents an end to
the process of centralising the control of EC affairs in Brussels. Article
3b of the treaty, the one that states the principle of subsidiarity, would
be highlighted, perhaps by having everyone sign a new document affirming
that that is the way in which the future European Union will work.
The foreign secretary acknowledges that a declaration of this kind would not
suffice; he is looking for some further, concrete, means of making the same
point. It could not be a mere PR exercise. The groundwork for a fresh
proposal to tame the commission is therefore being carefully laid. Both Mr
Hurd and the chancellor of the exchequer, Mr Norman Lamont, have complained
that Brussels pries too much into the nooks and crannies of national life;
in consequence the phrase 'nooks and crannies' has become part of foreign
office jargon. It is tagged onto the names of those regarded as the more
interfering of the commissioners. One such is Mr Carlo Ripa Di Meana, who
looks after the environment.
Mr Hurd likes to refer to his Mansion House speech of April 29. He said then
 -pre Denmark - that the idea of an EC with a strong single executive
alongside a council of ministers working by majority voting 'is now looking
somewhat old-fashioned and I believe that the tide of reality has turned
against it.' In short, a modified Maastricht is to be sold as the original
was - as a victory over the centralisers.
For this argument to prevail the alternatives must first be shown to be
faulty. One option is a root-and-branch renegotiation, in which the treaty
agreed last November is whittled down to a free trade area. Some
Conservative backbenchers would prefer that. Mr Hurd regards such a route as
unrealistic; if the treaty was reopened the centralisers would be on the
warpath. The German chancellor said so when he met Mr Major at the weekend.
The positions won by Britain on both subsidiarity and the distancing of
defence and internal security from the ambit of the commission would have to
be fought for again.
Another popular alternative is to accept that Maastricht cannot be ratified.
We could then settle for a Europe without it. The European Single Act would
be implemented. To this Mr Hurd protests that the present irritations, the
delving into 'nooks and crannies' by the commission, derive their
legitimisation from the original Treaty of Rome and the Single Act.
The government's overriding argument against the above two options, what it
appears to regard as the clincher, is that if Maastricht was to be abandoned
what would follow would be a long period of bad-tempered confusion, fraught
with danger. Everything would be questioned - the enlargement of the
community, the Gatt negotiations, the reform of the agricultural policy. The
Germans and the French would become so frustrated that after a while they
would start all over again. They would develop their European army. They
would build an inner core of strongly-united European nations, taking in the
Benelux countries and perhaps even in extremis the Italians. Once again
Britain would be on the outside, knowing it must join in, afraid of the
consequences if it did, fearful of what would happen if it did not.
That, then is the government's strategy - to deploy the above arguments, at
home and abroad, over as long a period as events will allow. If the Danes
are not back aboard by December, then early next year, or a few months
later, will do. If parliament will not ratify the treaty now, the autumn
will be OK. These arguments are not without substance. But even the British
ministers who must develop them know very well that there is only the
slimmest of chances that they will succeed.

Peter Godwin reports from Indonesia, the country with the fourth largest
population in the world in BBC2's often excellent foreign affairs series
Assignment (7.45). Spread over a thousand islands, the nation is determined
to become an industrial giant and a major world power, but there are doubts
about how long President Suharto can retain his position.
There is no mistaking the influence of ITV's original series of The
Comedians which began in 1971 and gave prominence to such stand-up comics as
Stan Boardman, Frank Carson, Bernard Manning, Tom O'Connor, Mike Reid, Roy
Walker and Charlie Williams. A new series begins at 8.30 and the 30 new
comedians include a woman, Pauline Daniels, disabled Tony Gerrard who works
from a wheelchair, Roy Walker's son Phil, Scotsman Eddie Devine and,
youngest of the bunch, Jimmy Bright, who is 21.
This season's passion for documentaries which take the lid off sports
management and economics continues in More Than A Game (10.50 BBC1). which
looks at agents, sponsors, and television itself which is now removing major
sporting occasions from the public domain.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Arts: Jenufa - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the stirring revival of Janacek's Jenufa at Glyndebourne, Anja Silja has
been universally praised as the Sextoness (the 'Kostelnicka'), Jenufa's
stepmother - and arguably the tragic heroine of the opera. Twice in the run,
however, the role has been assigned to Susan Bickley: last Sunday, and also
on July 17. I can assure any readers who have booked for the latter
performance that they needn't fear disappointment. The formidable strength
and depth of Miss Bickley's Kostelnicka belie her still-tender years. Quite
rightly, she won vociferous acclaim on Sunday.
I have not seen the Silja portrayal, but Miss Bickley cannot be simply
stepping into her shoes, for these two performers are alike in nothing but
their dramatic dedication. The Bickley Kostelnicka is neither a tyrant nor a
hypocrite; at least, she isn't played as either of those things. If in the
course of events she proves to be both, it is a bitter discovery for her -
and not, therefore, a come-uppance to be relished, but genuine tragedy.
Though she moves with heavy dignity, she does not arrive in Act 1 as a moral
bully (and therefore makes less immediate impact than Kostelnickas who think
they are Katishas). For once, her fatal refusal to let Jenufa marry Steva
until he has spent a whole year sober seems like mature commonsense, against
the sentimental cries of 'Hard-hearted]' from the chorus. From Act 2 to the
end, while she turns the disaster of Jenufa's pregnancy into a worse
disaster of her own, she pours out anguished feeling on a grand scale.
There is hard steel in the Bickley timbre, as a Kostelnicka needs, but her
phrases have the ring of searing candour - not melodramatic or
self-righteous, but saturated with clear-eyed desperation. She is too
stiff-necked to plead for our sympathy, and thus earns it in spades. Vocal
steel like hers will be more comfortably accommodated, we all hope, in the
larger new Glyndebourne house. And the sound of a Janacek orchestra, too: it
was no fault of Yakov Kreizberg, who conducts the score with incisive
understanding, that the result - always compelling  - was sometimes gritty.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Arts: Artists' worlds converge in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LYNN MACRITCHIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hurrying down Brick Lane on my way to the EDGE office, pushing against the
tide of men heading for Friday prayers, suddenly I lost all sense of being
in London, indeed of being in any place familiar to me. This was somewhere
else, not east not west, not north not south, but a place which was all of
these, a place made of things I knew but could not recognise. Just for an
instant, the world had changed.
Not all the works to be seen in the EDGE Biennale of Innovative Visual Art,
which runs until June 14, offer so vivid and unsettling an experience, but
most of them at least try. And pushing through the streets finding them,
from Spitalfields to Docklands and back north to Hornsey, is all part of the
show.
This year, the third time the biennale has been held, it reached heights of
ambition which almost overwhelmed even its redoubtable directors, Rob la
Frenais and Tracey Warr. Since the first show in Clerkenwell in 1988, EDGE
has always had an international cast of artists and several locations -
Glasgow, Newcastle and Rotterdam in 1990. This year Europe's Culture
Capital, Madrid, was approached and persuaded to host the show jointly with
London, thus also offering the enticing possibility of European as well as
UK-based funding for the show.
In an exhibition which attempts such a lot - to symbolise a united Europe,
to question, in several of the pieces by artists from the Americas, the
'achievement' of Columbus and to create, through the environments,
performances and installations the artists made especially for sites in both
cities, genuine new worlds, a new order of the imagination - the possibility
for failure is enormous. The remarkable thing about the show is that,
despite its sometime chaotic interface with the viewing public, clutching
inadequate maps on their voyage of discovery, it often succeeds.
Some of the most accomplished pieces are situated conveniently close to the
EDGE centre in Brick Lane, where dubious maps and a handsome catalogue are
available, along with news of any artworks which may not be accessible that
day. Turning back from one of the huge models of guns made by Czech artist
David Cerny which dot the neighbourhood as part of his piece 'The Day of
Killing', a short stroll brings the visitor to Commercial Street where the
disused underground toilet, not the Hawksmoor church, is the object of
attention. Down the steep stairs (you must choose whether to descend by the
English or the Irish side) Irish artist Dorothy Cross has constructed a
urinal with a difference - a beautifully cast bronze map of the British
Isles, each of the two island masses which form the bowls drained by a
sensitively modelled penis.
Nearby, in an empty unit of Spitalfields market, in a space carefully swept
and lit, stands a font. Instead of the baptismal water, its bowl holds a
mass of strawberries, which a mechanical hammer pounds slowly into a pulp:
the fragrance of crushed fruit fills the air. On the wall, the redness of
more crushed fruit, displayed behind four neat glass ovals lit by naked
light bulbs, reveals at the centre of the sticky mass the white brick of the
wall forming the letters RAGE.
Leaving this pristine and yet decaying environment, the work of British
artist Helen Chadwick, a further short walk to Broadgate reveals a vista of
an Indian village, or at least its human and animal inhabitants, arrayed in
neat ranks on the piazza above the station concourse. The sculptures, by
Indian artist Nek Chand Sinai, seem both ridiculously exotic and completely
at home in their new setting.
Wandering further, near Tower Hill in the old seaman's church of St Paul's,
Spanish artist Pepe Espaliu has created perhaps the most satisfying piece in
the show. It is very simple. In front of the disused altar, miraculously,
water runs, covering the marble expanse and trickling gently over the steps,
where it drains away. In the water sit the hassocks from the empty pews, not
exactly floating, not exactly praying, but seeming to do both, objects
interceding for the congregation which has deserted them. Also in the
church, a delicate piece by Martha Fleming makes use of shells and a mirror
which cannot reflect, although its viewers can.
Those with transport can find other pieces at Allen Gardens, Tobacco Dock,
Trinity Buoy Wharf, the Chisenhale Gallery - a beautiful installation by
Rose Finn Kelcey featuring a cloud of steam - and in the disused swimming
baths in Hornsey Road, where Maria Klonaris and Katerina Thomadaki have
created a huge, hermetic environment presided over by an angel (be sure to
check first by phone whether this piece is open).
Politics, sex, colonialism and prayer are but a few of these artists'
subjects: on a bad day, when the tube gets stuck and the exhibition sign has
fallen down, this diversity of concerns and difficulty of location can make
the whole complex enterprise seem a bit much, even a bit silly. But it is
not. In a world in which city life necessarily involves the parallel
existence of many different universes, seeing but not knowing each other,
experiencing art works in this way heightens our awareness of the infinite
strands of history and possibility which make up urban life.

Gordon Milne, who resigned as managing director of Scottish Metropolitan,
the Glasgow-based property company, in January, is to become visiting
professor of land economy at Aberdeen University. The part- time post will
involve Milne, who is 55, teaching and researching on property and land use
 -thereby also helping the university bridge the notorious gap between
academe and the business world.
In this latter role Milne will tell companies what the university's
department of land economy can offer them, with the aim of developing
consultancy services and obtaining sponsorship for research - all part of
the way in which universities try to diversify their sources of income.
He will target companies which either have big property interests or operate
in the land economy department's special field of marine resources
management, which covers such things as fishing and fish farming.
Milne is not a graduate himself. But he knows Aberdeen University well,
having delivered an annual Scottish Metropolitan property lecture since
1974. Having been forced to resign from the company he was long identified
with, by institutional investors annoyed when recession forced it into loss,
he say he regards the new post as a 'mid-career switch by means of which I
can put something back.'

FT  09 JUN 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: Member states must be consulted
about social fund grant reductions - European Law
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The European Court of Justice last week overturned European Commission
decisions to reduce European social fund grants for employment training
projects in three cases involving Portugal.
In one case concerning the retraining of unemployed people over 25,
especially from the small business sector, the Commission failed to give
Portugal the opportunity to comment on the proposed reduction in the grant.
Under social fund rules, the Commission may reduce the final financial
contribution when conditions attached to the initial grant are not
satisfied. But the member state concerned must have an opportunity to
comment beforehand.
In the other two cases concerning training projects for people under 25, the
ECJ said the Commission's decision infringed the Treaty of Rome's
requirements to state adequate reasons.
Although the decision referred in general terms to certain expenditure being
outside the grant as one reason, the Portuguese applicants had not been
informed of the method used for calculating their individual reduction.
The Commission explained that its standard practice was to issue short pro
forma decisions under European social fund powers. The Court said this
practice was inadequate to meet the standards of reasoning it required when
decisions have financial effects.
Following these cases, Community countries should be able to insist on
greater participation and respect for their rights under social policy
measures administered by the Commission.
Cases C-157/90, C-181/90 and C-189/90, Infortec, Consorgan and Cipeke v
Commission, ECJ 2CH 4 June 1992.
Equal Pay and Social Security in Germany
The ECJ also ruled last week that a German law discriminating between
part-time and full-time employees is prohibited by Treaty of Rome sex
discrimination rules, when the part-time employees are mostly women.
The Court said, in particular, that a national law will infringe EC equal
pay law if it allows employers to pay part-time workers on the basis of
their part-time hours, when they undergo full-time training in connection
with worker representation, and full-time workers in the same situation are
paid on the basis of their full-time commitment.
Case C-360/90, Arbeiterwohlfahrt der Stadt Berlin v Monika Botel, ECJ 6CH 4
June 1992.
The court also interpreted the EC social security rules in favour of an
Italian worker who was in dispute with his German employer.
The Italian wanted six weeks' pay under German law on the basis of evidence
of his incapacity to work arising from illness on holiday.
The Court said that the employer could be held liable to pay the money even
though it was not a social security institution.
Case C-45/90, Paletta v Brennet AG, ECJ FC 3 June 1992.
Free movement, public procurement and VAT in Italy
An Italian law restricting beer imports with quantities of sulphur dioxide
above 20 mg per litre has been condemned by the ECJ under the Treaty of
Rome's free movement of goods rules.
The question arose in criminal proceedings against imports of French beer
lawfully made and sold in France by Brasserie Fischer with 36.8 mg of
sulphur dioxide per litre.
Following the approach adopted in previous cases to available national and
international scientific evidence, the Court held that Italy could not
justify such a low permitted quantity of the additive on public health
grounds. For example, twice the quantity was permitted in wine.
Cases C-13/91 and C-113/91, Debus, ECJ 5CH 4 June 1992.
The Court also condemned Italy's law intended to implement a 1971 EC public
procurement directive in the field of public works.
Two provisions of the law infringe the Treaty prohibition of discrimination
on the ground of nationality against providers of cross-border services.
First, the law reserves 15-30 per cent of works to companies with their
registered office in the Italian region concerned. This is also contrary to
the provisions of the directive itself.
Second, preference is given under the law to temporary associations or
consortia established in the region. Whether or not this amounted to overt
nationality discrimination, it still amounted to discrimination against
companies from other member states.
Cases C-360/89, Commission v Italy, ECJ FC, 3 June 1992.
Italy has also been found by the Court to infringe its obligations under the
EC Eighth VAT Directive by systematically ignoring the six-month period for
refunding VAT to non-resident tax payers.
Case C-287/91, Commission v Italy, ECJ FC, 3 June 1992.
Customs Classification,
Valuation and Imports
In a series of cases last week, the ECJ clarified the customs tariff heading
for non-sterilised blood serum of veal foetuses (Case C-318/90) and the
definition of 'Morello cherries in syrup' for the purposes of EC import and
minimum price rules (Case C-246/90).
Of more general interest, the ECJ has confirmed that the cost of credit,
agreed separately to the price of goods, in consideration of delayed payment
is not to be included in the customs value of the goods. (Case C-21/91).
Mars Ice Cream Suspense
Court of First Instance President, Cruz Vilaca, has given interlocutory
orders in the EC competition law dispute over the distribution of Mars
ice cream products in Germany.
Two German ice cream distributors who had refused to sell Mars ice cream
products appealed against a Commission interim decision requiring them to
sell the Mars products through their outlets. Simultaneously, they requested
the CFI to suspend the Commission's decision until their appeal had been
decided.
The president's order postpones full consideration of the interim suspension
application until the parties have supplied further relevant trading
information. Until then, the Commission's decision is suspended.
The order also allowed Mars to intervene in support of the Commission and
accepted confidential treatment claims by Langanese, one of the German
distributors, for parts of its submissions containing business secrets.
Cases T-24/92R and T-28/92R, Langanese and Scholler v Commission, CFI Order
of the President 8 May 1992.
Sunday Trading
Last week was unusually busy for the ECJ. As well as delivering 11
judgments, the Court held oral hearings in the UK Sunday trading cases
referred to the ECJ from the House of Lords and other UK courts in an
attempt to resolve the Sunday trading conundrum caused by Treaty of Rome
rules on the free movement of goods.

Hays, the business services group, has picked David Tibble, head of
financial control at BTR, as its new finance director, with Graham Williams
promoted into the new position of corporate development director.
Tibble, 40, was a contender for the job of finance director at BTR himself,
but the company went outside to pick Kathleen O'Donovan, the 35-year-old
former Ernst &amp; Young partner who has so impressed the City since she was
appointed last year.
Hays chairman Ronnie Frost said yesterday that 'after a six month search I
am delighted to have found someone who thinks it worthwhile to move to a
smaller company to be number one.' The experience in the financial work of a
bigger company, and one that has 'attacked and acquired aggressively' is
what Frost says he was looking for.
Frost has repositioned 49-year-old Williams, who was himself keen to move
from pure finance onto the commercial side of the business, in preparation
for an ambitious programme of acquisitions domestically and abroad. Frost
aims to double the company's size in the next three years. 'Graham speaks
perfect French and negotiable German' says Frost, adding that he will
continue 'to be supportive with the City' until Tibble's feet have been
under the desk for a while.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Technology: Prejudice in the classroom - Technically
Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S BACK to the drawing board for technology teaching in England and Wales.
The subject was made part of the national curriculum two years ago, which
means that all pupils up to the age of 16 must study technology in a form
determined by ministerial order.
Britain is the first country in Europe to enshrine the subject as a
compulsory part of the school timetable up to 16. Together with ventures
like the City Technology Colleges and the Technical and Vocational Education
Initiative, it was intended to redress the bias of the traditional
curriculum against the practical and applied, and give an entrepreneurial
edge to Britain's rising youth.
It may still do so - but not as currently taught in schools. A highly
critical report last week by the schools inspectorate led John Patten, the
education secretary, to set up an 'urgent inquiry' into the current regime,
with a view to producing a new curriculum and revised syllabuses for the
GCSE exam within three years.
The inspectorate found technology teaching to be poor in 40 per cent of
secondary schools. The most common problems were ill-prepared staff,
inadequate facilities and an over-complex curriculum framework with too
little emphasis on relating theory to practical skills.
First and foremost, schools were found to have had insufficient support in
getting technology up and running as a new subject. Lack of support staff
was found to be a weakness - in many cases a damaging side-effect of the
policy, supported by all political parties, of devolving more resources from
local education authorities (Leas) directly to schools.
'At a time when teachers need advice and support with the introduction of
technology,' said the inspectorate, 'many Leas have reduced the number of
advisory teachers and closed specialist in-service training centres, often
in order to reduce expenditure and to enable them to delegate more money to
schools.'
As to equipment: surprise, surprise, only half of all girls-only schools
have adequate facilities for teaching craft and design, and even fewer
boys-only schools cater for work with food and textiles. Yet more demands,
then, on hard-pressed capital budgets.
On the wider issue of teaching the subject, many schools were found simply
to be ignoring the rules. For the most part (in the jargon) they were
concentrating on 'artefacts' at the expense of 'systems' and 'environments'.
The Engineering Council is blunter: too much school technology, it says, is
'Blue Peter' stuff, a semi-serious break from 'real' work.
The inspectors noted one secondary school where pupils spent three weeks
trying to identify a need associated with the theme of 'communication'. By
the end of it several had become 'disillusioned' and in week four 'brought
in their own ingredients and made a pizza'. It may be that the training and
commitment of staff are more at fault than syllabuses, but the inquiry has
been asked to look at them again.
Integrating the component parts of the subject into a coherent whole is a
challenge many schools have yet to meet. 'Technology' is supposed to be more
than the sum of art, craft, design, home economics, business education and
information technology. Pre-1990, few schools offered all of those; many
taught only two or three.
The inspectorate divides schools into three: those taking a 'federated'
approach, with staff planning together but teaching only their specialism;
those who keep everything separated rigidly; and those adopting a fully
integrated approach. It likes the first approach best.
Underlying it all remains the problem of ingrained prejudice. Too often
schools still see technology as cooking and metalwork - pursuits to keep the
less able from wreaking havoc with the physics or Latin. Unsurprisingly, the
inspectorate found little worthwhile business education in technology
courses. That, after all, might even make Mastermind.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Technology: A matter of life or death - How biotech
companies can minimise risk in an industry full of pitfalls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the US Food and Drug Administration announced in April that it was
denying approval for a septic shock drug from Centocor, a US biotechnology
company, the entire industry sat up and took notice.
'It was a wake-up call for the sector,' said Kenneth Bate, chief financial
officer for Biogen, another US group. The incident was the second alarm to
be sounded that month, coming soon after the news that Centocor's competitor
Xoma had also been sent back to the drawing board by the FDA.
Analysts say biotech drug groups have become increasingly likely to play for
high stakes in recent years. After offsetting risks in the late 1980s
through joint ventures, mergers and licensing agreements, many biotech
companies are now reasserting their independence.
Much of the shift in strategy has to do with the phenomenal success of
Amgen, a California-based group which by pursuing a go-it-alone strategy in
the 1980s built itself into a Dollars 5bn operation. The company's
achievement inspired many start-ups to take a big gamble, and these days
biotechnology groups are more likely than ever to try to bring products to
market on their own.
'The trend in the industry has been to assume more risk,' said Mark
Goldberg, head of the Massachusetts Biotechnology Research Institute.
'Companies are increasingly likely to try to do everything themselves.'
But the more independent track is full of pitfalls, and Wall Street seems to
be waking up to the risks. The approval of Chiron's IL2 cancer drug in May
has done little to allay investors' fears of over-exposure. Indeed, the
incident seemed to confirm the belief that the go-it-alone strategy is not
always best.
The FDA had rejected the drug in 1990, signing a death sentence for the
product's original owner Cetus, which was purchased by Chiron last year.
Chiron, a more cautious participant, succeeded two years after Cetus had
failed.
To the industry, the message from the FDA seemed clear: patience and
thoroughness would be rewarded. The trouble is, these are expensive
commodities. 'If they succeed, the rewards are enough to make your mouth
water,' says one executive.
But winning is not easy. 'FDA approval isn't the only obstacle,' Goldberg
pointed out. 'Even if a company doesn't trip up in the initial research or
development phase, they may fail when the get to marketing or sales.'
The problems are compounded by an escalating cost structure. 'Costs go up by
multiples as you move from research to development to sales,' said Bate. 'A
Dollars 100,000 project can turn into a Dollars 10m project.'
The industry is now littered with the casualties of go-it-alone strategies.
Genetics Institute, also considered a high-risk taker, sold 60 per cent of
its shares to American Home Products in 1991. 'I wouldn't be surprised to
see Centocor up for sale soon,' said Henri Termeer, head of Genzyme
Corporation. Other observers worry that start-up companies in the sector
have an increasingly flimsy basis from which to build a success.
'Many new companies concentrate more on technology than on specific
products,' noted Lowell Sears, chief financial officer for Amgen. 'For
instance, they try to get patents on things like carbohydrate chemistry,
with the idea that the technology is bound to turn out some valuable
products. They are a few steps further from the market than we were when we
started, because we had a specific product in mind. They'll have to raise
significant amounts of money, and I just don't think they will make it.'
Amgen is the object of much admiration in the biotechnology business, an
example of a company which took a big gamble and won. Like Centocor, the
group bet heavily on its initial products, building up a sales and marketing
force even prior to FDA approval.
According to Sears, though, Amgen was never as risk-oriented as the market
believed. 'The difference between us and Centocor,' said Sears, 'is that we
were sure of our product from the beginning. We also worked very closely
with the FDA; we involved them and listened to them, and did not adopt an
adversarial approach.'
Although many biotechnology groups are risk-takers, there are several models
for controlling it. 'We don't try for large markets,' explained Larry Kurtz,
vice-president in charge of communications at Chiron. 'We try for small
successes. We've also done a pretty good job of bringing in other firms to
help develop products.'
One of the most conservative companies in the industry is Biogen. In the
beginning, Biogen's strategy was to license out its products to other
groups. The arrangement was simple. In exchange for up-front money to
finance research and development, Biogen sold the rights for many of its
drugs.
Now the group receives regular royalties from the products, and avoids
marketing and sales overhead. 'The advantage of that strategy is that we
have a steady revenue stream,' said Bate. The problem with the approach is
that it severely limits profit potential. For initial products like the
hepatitus B vaccines, Biogen received just Dollars 80m in royalties on some
Dollars 700m in sales.
'There is the danger in following an ultra-conservative strategy that a
company will become little more than a coupon clipper,' said Goldberg. In
the wake of the Centocor incident, Biogen feels its stance is vindicated.
'We're a little less sexy than other biotech firms, but it's the time to
be,' said Bate.
One money-making gem, Genzyme, has its own recommendation for risk control:
old-fashioned conservative fiscal management. 'We never finance research for
a product we can't afford, said Termeer. 'We use our own money to finance
development, and if it's too expensive, we just drop the idea.'
Genzyme's chairman has little respect for the methods of heavy risk-oriented
companies. 'Some groups in the sector start spending and hope for FDA
approval before the money runs out,' he said. 'As the time for approval
draws near, they're making tremendous losses.'
Ultimately, it may not be the biotechnology groups themselves which decide
how much risk they will take on. The sector's future depends on investors'
willingness to put up venture capital, and some experts believe Wall
Street's love affair with high-risk biotechnology groups may be over.
According to Gabriel Schmergel, chief executive officer of Genetics
Institute. 'If you win, you'll win big, and if you lose you'll lose big. The
problem is, nine times out of ten, you lose.'

FT  09 JUN 92 / Technology: Spirits lifted at Otis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The last thing most people want when they get trapped in a lift is to be
talked to by a computer - but they do want to talk to someone.
At Otis's new nationwide service and training centre in west London, a
computer screen flashes red when it receives an electronic message from
sensors attached to lifts. This prompts the human touch to come into play,
with a telephone call to the unfortunate passenger. An Otis engineer,
meanwhile, is automatically notified.
Innovations like the Remote Elevator Monitoring service are important for
Otis. Technology is being used to strengthen lift-makers' service business,
which is at the centre of a power battle in an industry that has seen new
equipment sales floored by the recession. Even in good times for new sales,
service business accounts for the lion's share of the industry's profits.
But the relationship between service and technology works both ways, says
Bill Hogg, general manager at the centre.
Improved quality of service to existing customers, for example, can lead
indirectly to increased business for Otis modernising old-technology lifts.
Microprocessors have been used in lifts for at least 20 years, but 70 per
cent of the 150,000 lifts in the UK still use relay technology.
The recession in the UK construction market has made Otis's Pounds 5m
investment in its new centre, opened in December, particularly timely. New
lift sales fell 50 per cent in 1990, and a further 50 per cent fall last
year, says Hogg.
The investment has enabled the company to bring together functions such as
its Otisline data and information management system, its modernisation
business and its service centre and related engineering and training
functions.
Otisline, introduced two years ago in the UK, is a classic illustration of
the symbiosis between after-sales service business and technology. For the
customer, it offers 24-hour access to the company's engineers in case of
faults.
For Otis, the system performs as a database that gives early warning of any
recurrent faults - information used in new product design.

IS THERE A GOSPEL FOR THE RICH? by Richard Harries Mowbray Pounds 12.99, 182
pages
WHEN ALL is said and done, the Gospel is not much help to the digestion of
your typical FT reader. It is not just the eye of the needle conundrum: the
blessings of poverty, hostility to possessions and attacks on
acquisitiveness feature on every page. True, the apostles - even Christ
himself - were, by and large, self-employed petit bourgeois. But 'love
communism' is a fair description of the life they and their early followers
led; and the ideal animates not just third-world Catholic priests, but at
least part of the impoverished masses to whom they minister.
It is something of a relief, then, to have Richard Harries, the urbane
Bishop of Oxford, interpret the Word to the City. Yes, the poor demand our
attention and generosity. But no, you do not have to sell all and donate it
 -unless you feel called to do so.
More to the point, there is no hard-and-fast definition of who are the poor.
'All are rich in the light of world poverty,' yet poverty is not simply
about material wealth. Anyone suffering affliction and oppression - 'all
those who are losing out in some way because they are up against the world
as it is' - are poor.
Bishop Harries's argument is fairly conventional, though elegantly
expressed. Free-market capitalism is 'the worst system we've got - except
for all the others.' Following Luther, if jobs are necessary to the working
of human society, then filling them is an honourable Christian vocation. 'It
is as Christian to be a banker as a bishop, as religious to be a stockbroker
as a monk.'
The generation of wealth is a moral activity, and the job of business is
that of 'increasing the resources of society so that the quality of life for
all might be improved.' Provided, that is, it is done in an ethical fashion
 -pause to praise the City ('a place of great personal integrity') and to
plug the bishop's campaign against the Church Commissioners for failing to
follow an 'ethical' investment policy.
It is the uses to which wealth is put that matter. The bishop does not go as
far as Wesley ('gain all you can: save all you can: give all you can'), but
almost. There is no Christian blueprint for a fair and just order - just
precepts and a tradition to guide individual Christians. Most of the book is
a commentary on the two, peppered with thoughts-for-the-day on Modern Life.
The latter are not particularly profound, but revealing for the light they
cast on the Church of England's post-Thatcher view of the world.
'God wills a stable order as a precondition for genuine human community,'
says the bishop. Inflation is the enemy of stability, 'so however painful
and undesirable it is, it may be necessary for a society to experience
substantial unemployment. All a Christian can do is insist that extensive
unemployment cannot be tolerated indefinitely.' So Norman Lamont can sleep
with a clear conscience. But not George Bush, alas; since some pages later
the American dream is derided as 'destructive' because 'it fails to
recognise that there are other values in human society besides success, and
we all have to relate to one other as mutual failures, not just potential
victors.'
The biggest lacuna in the book is its obsession with the very rich and the
very poor - home and abroad - fortified by an outdated preoccupation with
Marx and Marxism. What about Essex Man - rich in the light of world poverty,
but with little in the way of shares and capital of which to dispose, and
living on the margins of middle class respectability?
Most of us, after all, are middling in our own society's estimation. The
bishop has something to say about what should be done to us: companies
should follow stakeholding policies a la Charles Handy, offering
consultation and share options aplenty. But what should be done by us goes
largely unsaid. Refuse to work for companies investing in Serbia? A tenth of
our income to Oxfam - and to hell with the mortgage?
In other words, is there a gospel for Basildon? Until the bishop and his
colleagues start telling us, the C of E and its works will become still more
irrelevant to the great mass of its own people.

FT  09 JUN 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (23): How to learn from
truancy - Economics, Finance, Industry, Trade, Management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIT MCMAHON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TRUANT DISPOSITION by Ronald Grierson Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson Pounds 9.99,
112 pages
THE BOOK is like the man: brisk, stylish, amusing and elusive - especially,
elusive. It is, as the author says, not 'an autobiography in any accepted
sense of the term. It is a random series of reflections on those periods of
my adult life when, instead of pursuing my business career, I frivolously
played truant from it.'
This means that, though the title is Horatio's phrase, the book more
resembles Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead, with only the most
tantalising glimpses from time to time of the main action. Ronnie Grierson
was with Warburgs for 26 years - and a director for 16 - but there is
nothing of this, no stories of the great Siegmund, nothing except his forced
resignation at the time of the Plessey bid because he was a director of GEC.
A recurrent theme of the book, signalled explicitly in the foreword, is that
of the awkward German immigrant confronting 'that most intimidating of
mafias, the British Establishment', ineffable in its condescension. But the
incidents themselves suggest something different. Ronnie, having been born
in Nuremburg in 1921, started the war as an interned Oxford undergraduate
and ended it, aged 24, as a Lieutenant Colonel in the Black Watch, complete
with kilt.
His whole life appears to have been punctuated with requests from all parts
of the Establishment to perform important tasks, and his career has been
crowned with a knighthood. Perhaps both he and the Establishment are more
subtle than he suggests (though his picture of the straight-faced
shin-kicking of the Civil Service rings true).
As for the truancies themselves, the puzzle remains why he embarked on his
various ventures into public service - most famously, but not only, the IRC
and the Brussels Commission. There is a pattern. The request arrives; his
friends advise against it; his previous experience and his instincts suggest
that he will encounter fatuity, banality, bureaucracy, misguided
interventionism and frustration. He takes the job. It turns out just as he
feared and he leaves it in something of a blaze. He comes over, in short, as
disillusioned without having been illusioned in the first place.
Which is not to say that the reasons for his disillusionment are not well
set out. He is devastating on the naivete and muddled thinking that
characterise much interventionism; on the false analogies between government
and business; and on the dreary unreality of much that goes on in the
Commission in Brussels. Perhaps the simple truth is that he is a romantic.
It is good to see that his last truancy was no truancy at all but the highly
successful development of the South Bank.
As in any reminiscences, the anecdotes are the best bits. His first
encounter with the world's public service was a surreal attempt to join the
Egyptian army in 1940. We get no details of an obviously distinguished and
exciting career in the SAS, except for the War Office's choice of his cover
nationality: a New Zealand Grierson is an oxymoron indeed] There is a
picture of the Swedish Gunnar Myrdal, one of the world's great one-worlders,
who could not stand Norwegians. There is the moment when James Callaghan,
praising Alf Robens for his diligence in closing pits, discovered that the
latest was in his constituency. And many more.
But not enough. This really is a slim volume. And unlike Paradise Lost (in
Dr Johnson's view) and most autobiographies (in mine), one would wish it
longer.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Speaking the language of
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Danes have provided a temporary setback to the European Community's
plans for political and monetary union but progress towards the creation of
a single European market continues uninterrupted, writes Charles Batchelor.
Even at this late stage - the formal launch date for the single market is
January 1, 1993 - there is still time for dilatory businessmen or women to
take action. Many of the measures needed to implement the single market will
not be in place until long after the official deadline and the EC will
continue to extend its influence over the coming years.
The message of Influencing the European Community: Guidelines for a
Successful Business Strategy (Kogan Page 358 pages Pounds 35) is that
businesses are not simply obliged to respond to change: they can also affect
its course.
Cecilia Andersen provides an encyclopaedic account of the workings of the
community and detailed explanation of how companies can influence the
preparation of EC regulations.
Andersen, an academic and a consultant, urges companies to adopt a European
public affairs strategy suited to their size. Large companies should
identify policy planners and decision-makers in community institutions and
establish good communications with them, she says.
They should participate in key organisations and groups where community
initiatives which concern the business are dealt with and take part in the
technical preparation of community legislation.
Companies should gather information on community issues and disseminate it
within the organisation. They should also foster a corporate European
mentality so the business is seen as knowledgeable on European issues.
Small businesses, with more limited resources, should make use of the free
and low-cost channels of help and advice available, while consultants can be
used to solve specific problems or to lobby for the business's interests in
Brussels.
A business's public affairs campaign should not be confined to the
Commission, despite its pivotal role in the single market process. Sometimes
it may make more sense to turn to the officials of member states, or their
permanent representatives based in Brussels. Members of the European
Parliament and their specialist committees can also prove useful allies.
A company which wants to influence a specific piece of legislation should
concentrate on the early drafting work by the Commission, Andersen suggests.
Commission officials will draft a policy proposal and then hold discussions
with outside experts selected by member states.
A working party from the appropriate directorate general will then refine
the proposal taking the views of interest groups into account. Other
directorates general will be contacted for their views before the proposal
moves up for commission-level action, by which stage the contents are more
or less final. Andersen has written an essential, if somewhat wordy,
handbook for businesses of all sizes which need to take the European market
seriously.
A less discursive guide to getting your voice heard in Brussels is provided
by Effective Lobbying In The European Community (Kluwer Law and Taxation
Publishers. 162 pages. Pounds 26). James Gardner, a US lawyer, describes the
structure of the Brussels bureaucracy and the organisations which companies
are likely to encounter.
His advice is of value to small and large businesses alike. A weakness of
this otherwise helpful book is its failure to provide case histories of
successful, and more interestingly perhaps, unsuccessful lobbying campaigns.
For the businessman or woman less concerned with influencing the European
Community's decision-making process than with simply understanding the
debate, The European Community Fact Book: Second Edition (Kogan Page 256
pages Pounds 12.95) provides a handy guide.
Alex Roney, legal counsellor for the London Chamber of Commerce, provides a
concise review of European community institutions (including a chapter on
institutions not to be confused with EC institutions) and the main elements
of Brussels' policy-making.
An even more abbreviated guide to Europe and its jargon is provided by 1992
Eurospeak Explained (Rosters, 158 pages Pounds 5.95). The book starts with
the briefest of introductions to community institutions and a quick, but not
unhelpful, outline of how best to lobby Brussels.
Stephen Crampton, secretary of a UK consumer group concerned with EC issues,
then moves on to provide an A to Z of European terminology. His explanations
may prove too brief for some readers but others will find it a useful, basic
source of reference.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Benefiting the taxman -
In a Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies frequently lay themselves open to making unnecessary tax and
national insurance contributions by the way they treat benefits to
employees.
They may also incur penalties if they overstep the rules, according to
accountants Blick Rothenberg.
Most mistakes are made when companies reimburse employees for payments such
as credit card invoices, telephone bills, school fees, club subscriptions or
other personal spending made good by the employer.
A company which pays an employee's home telephone bill must make sure that
the bill is addressed to the company.
If it does this there will be no national insurance to pay though the
individual will be liable to pay income tax on the sum.
If the bill is sent to the employee's address, then the company, and
possibly also the individual, will have national insurance to pay as well.
A self-appraisal questionnaire to help employers spot problems is available
from Blick Rothenberg, 12 York Gate, London NW1 4QS. Fax 071 935 6852. Free.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Fishing curbs 'may not be extended'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
    By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT does not intend extending restrictions on the number of days
that fishing boats may spend at sea to vessels under 10 metres in length
'unless it were necessary,' Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, said
yesterday, David Owen writes.
He said the Sea Fish (Conservation) Bill would give him the power to do so.
'We have to build information about the behaviour of the under-10-metre
fleet,' he said.
The measure, which received its second Commons reading yesterday, would
restrict time at sea for some 3,800 vessels over 10 metres in length and
increase sharply the maximum penalty for breaching a fishing licence
condition.
The bill received a cool welcome both from Labour and some Tory
backbenchers, in spite of Mr Curry's warnings about the importance of fish
conservation to the industry's viability.
Mr David Harris, the Conservative MP for St Ives expressed 'the greatest
reservations' about the measure and said he would not be supporting it.
'Fishermen from other countries will continue fishing while our boats are
tied up,' he claimed.
For Labour, Mr Elliott Morley, a frontbench fisheries spokesman, described
the measure as 'the sea fish crisis management bill' and said restricting
fishing hours was 'a bureaucratic way of dealing with the problem of
overcapacity in our fleet'.
'There is no actual guarantee that a bill like this is going to be genuinely
a conservation measure,' he said, calling for a 'properly funded' vessel
decommissioning scheme.
He branded the government's planned Pounds 25m scheme 'a real tiddler' and
predicted that it would produce a reduction in capacity of approximately 3
per cent.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: DTI probe to centre on offer for
sale of MGN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HYPE surrounding the flotation of Mirror Group Newspapers included a
tabloid-style prospectus and a television advertising campaign featuring
Andy Capp, the paper's famous cartoon character.
Yet there was much suspicion about the issue - which valued MGN at Pounds
500m - even at the time. The UK part of the offer was only just subscribed.
The share price was set at 125p, but after closing a bare  1/2 p above that
on the first day of dealings, the shares never regained their sale price
until Robert Maxwell's death. On the day he died, MGN shares stood at 77 1/2
p. Ironically, when they were suspended in December they had just returned
to 125p.
Now Department of Trade and Industry inspectors are to examine the affairs
of MGN, with the offers for sale in May last year the particular subject of
their scrutiny.
The float involved a public offer for sale in the UK of 114m shares, handled
by merchant bank Samuel Montagu and broker Smith New Court. A further 78.5m
shares were offered to investors outside the UK by Salomon Brothers
International. Another 3.9m shares were set aside for an employee share
ownership scheme.
UK public offers are tightly regulated. They involve the publication of
large documents with much small print, closely scrutinised by lawyers and
accountants. Issuing a 'false prospectus' is a serious offence. The DTI
inspectors will have to decide whether investors were misled.
Even before the prospectus was written, there was concern in the City about
the influence Mr Maxwell might exert over the company. He was retaining a 51
per cent stake, and his style had always been to swap assets among his
companies.
To counter such fears, Mr Maxwell promised to appoint independent
non-executives to the MGN board months before the issue. When the prospectus
was published, it described an elaborate 'ring fence' intended to prevent
MGN's cash being siphoned off to private Maxwell companies.
Samuel Montagu, the merchant bank that advised on the UK offer, has said in
the past that it 'went to some lengths in the MGN flotation prospectus to
make sure MGN was an independent entity'. The bank said last night that it
intended to co-operate fully with the DTI inspectors.
Not long after Mr Maxwell's death in November it was discovered that Pounds
45m of MGN cash had been paid to Maxwell private companies. It was to be
invested in gilt-edged stock, but the stock has not been found. The
transaction was not, it seems, approved by the MGN board.
The prospectus assured investors that the MGN pension scheme was in good
shape. In the small print, it said the Mirror scheme had a surplus of Pounds
149.3m. After Mr Maxwell's death it emerged that there was a deficit of more
than twice that.
Further, it has emerged that Mr Maxwell was secretly buying MGN shares
within weeks of the flotation in an attempt to keep the market price up. He
had pledged MGN shares as well as shares in his other quoted company,
Maxwell Communications Corporation, as collateral against loans. As the
share price fell, the collateral was worth less and less.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Council anger at pay opt-out advice
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT advice to local councils to opt out of national pay bargaining
has evoked a strong response from the Association of Metropolitan
Authorities.
The Environment Department, in guidance to the Local Government Commission,
which is advising on the future of the authorities, says the government
supports moves to 'greater realism, flexibility and performance-related pay
within the national pay negotiating framework'.
It adds that it is also encouraging authorities to opt out of that
framework.
In a letter to Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, the association
says that of the 25 authorities that have already opted out, most arrived
last year at settlements that were higher than the national deal.
It adds: 'It seems perverse for the government, who are keen for all
employers to avoid inflationary wage settlements, to encourage authorities
to opt out of national bargaining which can only have the effect of
leapfrogging.'

FT  09 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Finland aims to put its house in order
ahead of EC entry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINLAND is to remove barriers to foreign investment, and privatise state-run
industries before entry into the EC in 1995, according to Mr Pertti
Salolainen, deputy prime minister and trade minister.
'We want to build confidence both internally and abroad that Finland will be
a full partner in the EC, a reliable partner which can deliver,' Mr
Salolainen said. 'We are ready to make sacrifices to put our house in
order.' Inward investment would be 'totally free' by the end of this year.
The country's determination to join the EC appears unaffected by Denmark's
recent referendum threatening the EC's integration plans as formulated at
the Maastricht summit late last year: 'We don't expect the EC to rein in on
commitments, despite Denmark's referendum,' Mr Salolainen said.
He expected the EC's answer to Finland's request for full membership to be
ready by the end of this year, with 1993 dedicated to detailed negotiations
for Austria, Sweden and Finland. A national referendum on the terms of entry
into the EC will be held in 1994; full membership is timed to come into
effect at the beginning of 1995.
Finland has over the past two years been thrown into deeper economic turmoil
than at any time in the past 40 years. The collapse of trade with the former
Soviet Union, which until two years ago made up 26 per cent of exports,
coincided with recession in its two main western markets, the UK and Sweden.
Reorientation of the economy started last year with a 14 per cent
devaluation of the Finnish markka. This alone has boosted exports by between
10-15 per cent, and improved competitiveness by 20 per cent since the low
point of the third quarter last year, Mr Salolainen said. The improvement is
urgently needed, since trade collapsed by 19.2 per cent last year, from
Dollars 27.0bn (Pounds 14.8bn) in 1990 to Dollars 21.8bn in 1991.
'We had a bit of bad luck in all directions,' Mr Salolainen added. Trade
with the former Soviet Union, which used to account for a large share of
Finland's energy imports and a big proportion of its exports of textiles and
clothing, shoes and leather goods, has slumped to 3 per cent of total trade.
Strategy towards the former Soviet Union will now focus on the Baltic
states, mainly Estonia, training east bloc business leaders, enhancing farm
output, and cleaning up the environment. Finland sees itself as a 'gateway'
to the eastern bloc, and is trying to attract investment for a road linking
Poland and the Baltics to the St Petersburg area.
Its nationalised petroleum company, Neste, is evaluating Russia's energy
resources, while the Poyry consultancy company has been asked to draw up a
plan for forestry in Russia and the Baltics. Since the former Soviet Union
is expected to recover so slowly, Finland has focused on diversifying its
trade with the west.
Sales to east Asian markets, including China, have risen strongly, from a
monthly average of Dollars 90m in 1991, to an average this year of Dollars
111m. While Germany has in the past year overtaken the UK and Sweden to
become the country's leading trading partner, Mr Salolainen said Britain
remained a top priority.
'It will take a couple of years, but I'm sure that we can put our house in
order by the time we enter the EC,' he concluded.

FT  09 JUN 92 / World Trade News: UK to boost exports to N America
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN aims to increase its exports to North America by Pounds 3bnby 1995
through a trade campaign to be launched next year, Sir Derek Hornby,
chairman of the British Overseas Trade Board (BOTB), said yesterday.
The campaign aims to lift Britain's share of North America's non-oil imports
by 25 per cent, from 4.3 per cent in 1991 to more than 5 per cent or Pounds
16bn. It will be at the core of an export promotion strategy targeting a
total of 54 markets, half of them in the priority areas of western Europe,
North America and east Asia.
Sir Derek was presenting the annual report of the BOTB, combined for the
first time with the board's plan for shaping the government's export
promotion programme for the year ahead. Mr Michael Heseltine, minister for
trade and industry and president of the BOTB, said he was 'reviewing all
factors that add up to the competitiveness of UK industry'. He warned of
signals that UK industry was 'overpaying itself', but did not expect to find
any 'quick fixes' to boosting export performance.
In western Europe, which accounted for almost 65 per cent of UK exports in
1991, the government plans to target commercial environmental technology and
car components, with the most initiatives in France, Germany, the
Netherlands and Sweden. In Japan, where the UK accounts for just 2.2 per
cent of imports, the 'Priority Japan' campaign continues to focus on
'perhaps the best business prospect among the OECD markets'. The rest of the
Pacific region is also targeted.

<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM led by Asea Brown Boveri (ABB), the Swedish-Swiss engineering
group, has won a Dollars 1.8bn (Pounds 980m) order to build an oil and
gas-fired power station and the world's biggest water desalination plant in
Abu Dhabi.
The Al Taweelah-B power station will consist of six steam turbine units of
125MW each. The desalination plant will produce 75m gallons of drinking
water a year.
Completion of the power plant, raising Abu Dhabi's generating capacity by
about a third, is scheduled for 1994. ABB's part of the deal is worth
Dollars 975m, with work to be carried out mainly by its subsidiaries in
Germany and Italy.
The Dollars 550m desalination plant will be built by the Iritecna subsidiary
of Italy's state-owned IRI holding group; Six Construct of Belgium will do
the civil engineering.
Mr Goran Lundberg, ABB executive vice-president in charge of power plants,
said: 'In the past six months, we have taken in Dollars 5bn in orders,
against Dollars 6.4bn in the whole of last year'.
Mr Fulvio Tornich, managing director of Iritecna, formed this year from a
merger of IRI's Italimpianti and Italstat subsidiaries, said the deal was
one of the biggest for an Italian company for desalination equipment in the
Middle East.
European Marine Contractors, a joint venture between Italy's Saipem group
and Brown &amp; Root of the US, has won a L650bn (Pounds 294.9m) contract to lay
900km of pipeline for a consortium led by Statoil, the Norwegian state oil
group.
The order, believed to be one of the biggest of its kind in the North Sea,
is for part of the Zeepipe project, to link gas finds from the Troll and
other Norwegian fields to the coast via a 40in-wide pipeline laid at depths
of 350 metres.
Work on the contract, including options for other pipelaying, starts next
year and should finish in 1995.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PANAMANIANS ranging from jobless slum dwellers to wealthy businessmen plan
to make their grievances known to US president George Bush when he visits
this week for the first time since he ordered an invasion of their country,
Reuter reports from Panama City.
All of them accuse the White House of doing too little to resolve lingering
problems caused by the December 1989 military strike that toppled strongman
General Manuel Noriega and killed at least 520 Panamanians.
'There are a lot of people in Panama who feel that the US should continue
giving to this country, that the aid hasn't been sufficient,' said a senior
Latin American diplomat.
'They'll take advantage of Bush's visit to ask for more.'
Mr Bush is scheduled to pass through the country on Thursday on his way to
the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro. He plans to meet Panamanian President
Guillermo Endara, sworn in at a US military base on the eve of the invasion,
and speak at a downtown plaza.
On the surface, Panama's post-invasion recovery looks sound. The economy,
buoyed in part by millions of dollars in cash, credits and loan guarantees
from the US, grew at an impressive 9.3 per cent rate last year. Deposits in
Panama's offshore banking sector rose from Dollars 11.5bn to Dollars 17bn
(Pounds 9.3bn) from December 1989 to December 1991.
But Panama's prosperity over the past 2 1/2 years has failed to reach a
sizeable portion of the population.
Unemployment in the Atlantic port city of Colon has climbed to 50 per cent
by some estimates. Residents there have rioted twice this year to demand
more help from the government.
In Panama City, where drug abuse has soared since the invasion, police are
battling a crime wave that appears unlikely to go away soon.
And the country's image is tainted by incessant reports that money
laundering has fuelled its booming construction and banking industries.

MR Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, has been elected head of an
International Green Cross being set up at his own suggestion to fight damage
to the environment, Reuter reports from Rio de Janeiro.
The Parliamentary Earth Summit of spiritual leaders and legislators from
around the world voted unanimously for Mr Gorbachev at the weekend. The
forum - grouping personalities as diverse as Tibet's spiritual leader, the
Dalai Lama, US Senator Al Gore and singer John Denver - is being held in
tandem with the official Earth Summit.
Mr Tarzie Vittachi, the forum's spokesman, said the goal of the
International Green Cross was to do for the earth and its resources 'what
the Red Cross was founded to do for people on the battlefield'.
The idea was proposed by Mr Gorbachev at a previous meeting of parliamentary
and religious leaders in Moscow in 1990, he said. In a message to the
Parliamentary Earth Summit, the former Soviet leader pledged to work
actively for the new group.

MERCHANT ENTERPRISE IN BRITAIN by Stanley Chapman Cambridge Pounds 40, 339
pages
ALMOST A decade ago the publication of Stanley Chapman's The Rise of
Merchant Banking transformed the landscape of financial history. Now his
masterly survey of the mercantile sector, sub-titled From the Industrial
Revolution to World War I, and focusing on the 19th century when Britain
dominated world trade as never before or since, has done the same for
another crucial piece in the overall jigsaw.
An ingenious ransacker of often heavily-concealed archival sources, and a
renowned exploiter of the 'free market' of ideas in current research,
Chapman continues to reach parts other historians sometimes do not know even
exist.
The core of the book comprises a series of penetrating studies on specific
themes: the destructive yet cathartic consequences of the French Wars,
clearing out a whole generation of merchants while bringing in another; the
merchants and cotton brokers (mainly in Liverpool) who made their fortunes
out of the Atlantic trade; the British agency houses in India and the Far
East, whose performance was rather better than the recent indigenous
literature would suggest; the City of London's impressively large-scale
textile quarter, mainly to the north of Cheapside, before its warehouses
were bombed out of existence by the Luftwaffe; the response to the coming of
the telegraph; and the way in which, late in the century, trading
enterprises transformed themselves into British-based investment groups,
allowing the advantages of the joint-stock system without the loss of family
control.
Underlying much of Chapman's analysis is a view of British business, and in
particular the City of London, which stresses the importance of diversity -
whether ethnic, cultural or organisational.
One of his great services has been to emphasise the foreign contribution to
the City, a cosmopolitan tradition starting before Nathan Rothschild in the
early 19th century and now continuing after Siegmund Warburg in the late
20th. Many of these immigrants have merged harmoniously enough into the
'Anglo' establishment, others have not, often through their own inclination
to stay apart. There remains much to debate about 'gentlemanly capitalism',
a current favourite concept of the historical profession.
An open City is also a Darwinian City, and at any one time those engaged in
it are keenly aware - and if not, keenly curious - of the credit ratings and
general standing of their rivals and those with whom they do business. Here,
as ever, Chapman makes suggestive use of 'character books', but it is a
shame their human dimension does not come through more strongly.
Take for example the book compiled by Barings in the late 1820s on some of
the City's leading merchants shipping colonial produce to the Continent.
Cordes is 'so cautious and prudent in what he does that the writer
entertains the best opinion of him'; Lobeck is 'far too sanguine a man';
Schmaeck 'is well disposed, but has not sufficient talent'; Walfords &amp; Green
are 'too much of Gentlemen to compete in the Market with the Industrious'.
The book also records their eventual fates. All failed except Cordes - who,
fitting his character, left merchanting altogether and turned . . .
clergyman.

MERCHANTS OF THE RAJ by Stephanie Jones Macmillan Press Pounds 40, 434 pages
DR JONES has written two histories of the Inchcape Group and family - Two
Centuries of Overseas Trade and Trade and Shipping.
She now adds a curious, not-uninteresting, 'symposium' (the word is Lord
Inchcape's) of the story of Calcutta's distinctive managing-agency houses,
opening in the mid-19th century but concentrating on the period since the
second war, so it is essentially the tale of the decline and fall of a
significant element in Britain's imperial trading system.
The history of Britain's commercial role in India is an important and
interesting subject and more than that, these reminiscences of burra sahibs
and chummeries and racism in the Club have their charm.
However, the decision of Dr Jones to limit her ambitions to a long sequence
of chopped-up verbatim interviews with about 70 of the 'Number One'
businessmen, mostly retired, carries with it serious weaknesses, principally
that it is an abdication of the historian's duty to describe, to analyse,
and then to make an impartial third-party assessment of, in this case, the
strengths and weaknesses of the managing-agencies.
This is lazy history. To be fair, perhaps it was Lord Inchcape's brief to
her.

heroes - History

MERCHANT PRINCES by Peter C Newman Viking, Pounds 20, 448 pages
THE QUALITY of The Hudson Bay Company's latter-day management was brought
home to its fur-trading veterans when they gathered on the auction floor of
Beaver House in London one evening in January 1988 to mourn the sale of the
fur business which had sustained their venerable company for the previous
318 years. As one participant remembered the evening, 'the greetings from
head office in Canada were as they had been for some years previous - zero.'
Such incidents - there are many more - raise a question mark over the title
of this third, and final, volume of the history of North America's oldest
company. Most of the men who have run The Hudson's Bay Company for the past
100 years have displayed neither the talent nor the glamour worthy of
Merchant Princes. One lost opportunity after another has diminished The Bay
over the past century from the colourful Company of Adventurers, who roamed
over a twelfth of the earth's surface trading furs, into a rather dull (and
not very profitable) collection of Canadian department stores.
The fur-trading business has been sold. So have the remote trading outposts
 -now mostly supermarkets - where The Bay's Factors introduced Indians and
Eskimos to the joys and sorrows of western civilisation. An oil and gas
business with vast reserves was sadly neglected before it too was eventually
put on the block. Even the department stores which now make up the rump of
the company have been in turmoil for years.
Just as it took The Bay more than a decade to capitalise on the booming
market in Arctic fox at the beginning of this century, its retail executives
hesitated in the 1950s and '60s to join the rush into suburban shopping
malls. The rather unremarkable qualities of most of the men who oversaw the
shift from fur trading to department stores have clearly given Newman, a
veteran Canadian business journalist, less material to work with for this
volume than for the previous two, Company of Adventurers and Caesars of the
Wilderness.
There are two notable exceptions. The Bay was brought into the 20th century
under the stewardship of the wily Donald Smith, who was propelled in middle
age from his fur trading outpost in Labrador to become, as Lord Strathcona,
one of the company's longest-serving Governors.
While in Labrador, Smith had the HBC's supply ship bring him a year's supply
of The Times on its annual visit. He made a point of reading each paper over
breakfast precisely one year after publication. In later years, Strathcona
celebrated milestones in his career, such as his peerage, by remarrying his
wife - four times altogether.
The Bay's present controlling shareholder, the second Lord Thomson of Fleet,
is also no run-of-the-mill businessman. Although now in his late 60s,
Thomson (or simply Ken, as he prefers to be known in Canada) still lives in
the shadow of his lively, newspaper-proprietor father.
The younger Thomson has always shown more interest in his dog and his
collection of Cornelius Krieghoff paintings than in his business
investments. To save money, the world's eighth richest man has his hair cut
by his wife; he saves on electricity bills by eating in the kitchen of his
Toronto mansion.
One theory suggests that Thomson hit on the idea of buying The Bay one night
while walking his beloved dog, Gonzo, through a park near his home. The most
visible object from the park is The Bay's ochre neon sign on its head office
building a few blocks away.
The Bay will probably be led into the 21st century by Ken Thomson's eldest
son, David, whose attention has so far been focused as much on the painter
John Constable as on the family businesses. Judging by Newman's description
of David Thomson as 'an improbable mixture of introspective genius and
post-industrial babble', the chances seem slim that anyone will find enough
material for a fourth best-selling volume on the venerable Hudson's Bay
Company.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Jakarta struggles to control its deregulation: Indonesia's
test of economic management may have just begun
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA, a centrally controlled, bankrupt economy in the mid-1960s, has
emerged into the 1990s with a 20-year record of economic growth. However,
there are signs that the government, which is certain to be returned to
power in today's general election, is struggling to control the deregulated
economy it has fashioned.
Deregulation began in earnest in 1983, supported by the Asian Development
Bank and the World Bank and prompted by the collapse in crude oil prices.
With oil and gas accounting for 80 per cent of Indonesia's export revenue in
1982, the country was faced with a crisis.
The subsequent rise in non-oil-and-gas exports and imports reflects both the
success of deregulation and the problems the government must confront:
exports have risen from Dollars 5.9bn (Pounds 3.24bn) in 1984 to Dollars
17.6bn last year, but imports have shown a concomitant rise from Dollars
13.9bn to Dollars 23.4bn.
Oil and gas last year accounted for just 39 per cent of total export
proceeds, but the cost of change is reflected in a 180 per cent rise in
public external debt since 1983 to Dollars 50bn. Servicing public debt this
year is expected to cost Dollars 7.3bn, or about 24 per cent of total export
proceeds.
As a result, Indonesia relies on foreign aid to cover a current account
deficit which reached Dollars 4.48bn last year and which donors expect to be
Dollars 4.8bn in 1992.
Dr Radius Prawiro, senior economics minister, says the deficit 'compares
favourably with other developing countries. Our deficit of 3.5 per cent of
gross domestic product (GDP) compares with some 9 per cent for each of
Malaysia and Thailand.' He admits, however, that the deficit almost ran out
of control last year and would have been Dollars 8bn had the government not
stepped in to cool the economy.
The government's problem was that deregulation, particularly in the banking
industry, had prompted a surge in private sector activity. Domestic bank
credit grew 158 per cent between the end of 1988 and December last year to
Rp113,608bn (Dollars 56bn). Private overseas borrowing has increased from
Dollars 14bn in 1989 to Dollars 25bn.
The government acted to curb foreign borrowing last September when it
announced a review of state-related projects worth Dollars 79bn. The
government also set ceilings for new foreign borrowing for the banking
sector of about Dollars 2bn for each of the next five years. This followed a
tightening of money supply in February 1991. But the action was late and
with Indonesia already nudging credit ceilings on the international capital
market, unnecessarily strong.
Bank sector credit is only expected to grow 14 per cent this year. When a
forecast inflation rate of 8 per cent, down from 9.2 per cent last year, and
an expected 6 per cent depreciation of the rupiah against the dollar is
taken into account, real credit growth may even be negative. The tightening
of the money supply pushed lending rates up to 30 per cent. This in turn
increased company costs.
'Companies are very pessimistic,' says Dr Mari Pangestu, senior economist at
Jakarta's Centre for Strategic and International Studies. 'A lot of the
conglomerates expanded and diversified when there was a lot of money.
Perhaps the greatest concern after the high interest rate is a string of
company failures.'
Last year, two companies, Mantrust and Bentoel, reneged on debts totalling
Dollars 770m. The government has since relaxed money supply, but lending
rates have remained high at 24 per cent, not because of bank illiquidity but
because of a perceived high lending risk.
Banks are concerned that many loans made during the 1988-90 credit boom were
not invested efficiently. The central bank estimated bad and doubtful debts
of the banking sector in 1991 to be 5.9 per cent of total loans, up from 3.9
per cent in 1990.
Economists at donor agencies, however, say the bad debts of the five state
commercial banks which dominate the sector range from 15 to 25 per cent of
their portfolios, and that many banks are providing less than 1.5 per cent
of performing assets for bad debt. A worst-case scenario would see further
company failures exposing a critically weak banking sector.
But this is to discount the government's record of economic management and
the underlying dynamic of the economy, which, with new export-orientated
manufacturing production coming on stream, remains strong. The recent rise
in prices of crude oil should also improve export earnings.
Donors will be pushing for further deregulation to unleash growth,
particularly in the agricultural sector. Government ministers say that the
issue of private companies being given monopoly rights over certain farm
produce will be tackled within 12 months.
Two such companies are headed by children of President Suharto, which has
led to doubts over the political commitment to deregulation within the
administration. Government officials insist, however, that a further tranche
of tariff and trade deregulation is imminent.
The Asian Development Bank recently forecast GDP growth for this year at 6.7
per cent, the same as last year. The report stressed, however, that
'exploiting the country's considerable potential will require a continued
commitment to transforming the economy.' Raising per capita income,
estimated by the World Bank at Dollars 570, will be a slow task.
With consolidation among domestic banks and reduced credit on the
international capital market, future growth must come from increased
productivity. The government's test of economic management may have only
just begun.
Indonesia is ready to leave the ranks of the world's poor and nearly double
the income of its population by the end of the decade, the World Bank said,
Reuter reports from Jakarta.
However it is a formidable task and Jakarta must open up its economy, be
more efficient, improve local infrastructure and deal with a huge current
account deficit and foreign debt, it said in a confidential report obtained
by Reuters.
Foreign donors will have to continue large-scale aid, at least in the short
term, to help Indonesia pursue its widely-praised economic programmes.

   JERUSALEM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Israeli authorities yesterday allowed Palestinians from the occupied
Gaza Strip to go to work in Israel for the first time in 15 days, but
introduced tough new measures to cut down sharply on the number eligible to
do so.
Only a few thousand workers will initially qualify to cross into Israel
under the amended regulations compared with the 30,000 to 40,000 who did so
before the closure. Yesterday, only a few hundred had the necessary permits.
Employment in Israel, chiefly in the construction industry, is the main
source of income for the 750,000 inhabitants of the impoverished strip.
Israel sealed it off following the fatal stabbing by an unemployed Gazan of
an Israeli schoolgirl near Tel Aviv on May 24, despite army concerns that
the move would fuel further violent unrest in the territory.
Those allowed entry will be restricted to people over 28 years of age
employed in places where at least 10 Gazans work together.
Their Israeli employers will be required to collect them from exit
checkpoints - Gaza is fenced - and deliver them back after work.
They will have to carry a special red permit, in addition to at least three
sets of written permits already required to work in Israel.
Mr Hanan Rubin, spokesman for the Civil Administration, the military
government in Gaza and the West Bank, said it was intended to increase the
numbers allowed back into Israel over time, according to the situation.
However, Mr Rubin said the red permit and the requirement for all workers to
be collected and returned by their employers would be permanent measures.
He said it was also possible that the lower age limit of 28 would remain
permanently in force.
The Gaza Strip has been the most militant area against Israeli rule.

Mr S Samy Vellu, minister of energy, telecommunications and posts, will be

Mahathir told reporters.
Mr Samy Vellu, president of the country's main Indian party, the Malaysian
Indian Congress (MIC), has said the proceeds from the share sale went to a
college he helped set up.
Opposition leader Mr Lim Kit Siang accused Mr Samy Vellu last month of
'hijacking' 9m of 10m shares originally allotted to MIC's investment arm
Maika Holdings.
The 9m shares were later taken up by three companies and sold for a profit
of 7.16m ringgit (Pounds 1.5m). They would have been worth over 117.9m
ringgit at yesterday's prices.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Philippines fails to deliver power to the people: The severe
shortage of electricity has hit the economy harder than any of the natural
calamities that have befallen the country recently
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOME RESIDENTS of metropolitan Manila are not exaggerating when they
complain these days that in this age of laser technology they still cannot
enjoy the simple benefits of electricity.
Because of a severe supply shortage, power is rationed among industrial and
residential users in the Philippines' main island of Luzon, including Manila
and its suburbs.
Mrs Corazon Aquino, Philippines prime minister, last week ordered government
agencies to cut red tape and speed approvals for new power plants to ease
the power crisis which is hampering economic development plans.
Present plants are either old or inefficient so that they break down more
often than usual. Drought has stalled production at hydroelectric plants,
which account for much of available capacity.
The effects of the crisis have been more devastating to the economy than any
of the natural calamities - a killer earthquake, the mammoth eruption of
Mount Pinatubo, and a string of 'super-typhoons' - that have befallen the
Philippines recently.
The plants run by state-owned National Power Corporation (Napocor) meet only
three-quarters of the daily demand of some 3,150 MW on weekdays.
Power cuts, or 'brownouts', have already cost Manila industries some 20bn
pesos (Pounds 465m) in the first three weeks of May alone, according to Mr
Raul Concepcion, head of an inter-agency task force monitoring the
situation.
A 620 MW nuclear power plant, completed towards the end of the
administration of ousted president Ferdinand Marcos, was ordered mothballed
by Mrs Aquino because of suspicions of corruption in its financing and
questions over safety However, no new capacity was put up in place of the
nuclear plant.
The crippling electricity shortage has kept the local business sector edgy
over prospects of resulting aberrations in operating costs and markets. Some
industries are said to be contemplating laying off up to 150,000 workers if
the long power interruptions continue.
More importantly, the situation could again militate against efforts to
attract foreign investment, considered essential for the fledgling economic
recovery to be sustained.
For the short term, the solution seems to lie on the installation of gas
turbines and transportable diesel-powered plants. But being petroleum-fired
these tend to be costly to operate over long periods.
A plan for privatisation of Napocor plants, or even the awarding of
maintenance contracts to private groups, is being closely studied and much
is expected from the build-operate-transfer and build-own-operate schemes
offered to entice private groups into power generation.
Mr Wencesalo de la Paz, presidential energy adviser, says that Napocor is
providing for a 7 per cent annual increase in capacity starting this year.
By 1993 it expects to put on line 800 MW and by 1994 another 600-700 MW is
due. If these new plants are put in place as planned, there should be a
buffer of about 900 MW by 1994, which could allow Napocor time for
maintenance shutdowns to upgrade its facilities.
Investors, however, may not be willing to wait that long.

<TEXT>
THE Russian government yesterday claimed its reform strategy remained
intact, in spite of a week in which three senior ministers from the
industrial lobby entered the cabinet and an indefinite delay was put on
raising energy prices.
A new round of negotiations between the government and the IMF on an
economic programme starts in Moscow this week, with a deal still in the
balance. Agreement is required to give Russia access to Dollars 24bn (Pounds
13.1bn) of funds put up by the west and the IMF, and more importantly, to
allow the World Bank to lend to the republic.
Mr Anatoly Chubais, the minister in charge of privatisation, told an
economic conference yesterday that the pace of privatisation had quickened,
and that receipts now totalled Rbs5bn. This is, however, far short of the
rate necessary to fulfil a planned receipt of Rbs90bn this year.
The government passed a privatisation law through parliament on Friday
although deputies had refused to pass it a week before. Mr Boris Yeltsin,
the Russian president, has also said he will sign a decree to bring in a
bankruptcy law - which the deputies had also thrown out.
The bankruptcy law will have its casualties - as Mr Feodor Prokopov,
chairman of the Committee on Employment, said yesterday. The government
expects 4m unemployed by the year end, and is proposing unemployment benefit
of 75 per cent of the minimum wage.
Mr Chubais said that he still expected a struggle over the privatisation
programme, due to go back to parliament in a few days' time.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, now joint first deputy prime minister with Mr Vladimir
Shumeiko, the former deputy speaker of parliament, told Izvestia that
reforms hung on the solution of debts of Rbs1.7 trillion in the enterprise
sector and the lack of cash in the economy which has left millions of
workers unpaid. However, he said that he would not bail companies out with
more credit; and that the debt problem would be addressed by selling it off
at a discount.
Azerbaijan's nationalist Popular Front yesterday said its leader, Mr Abulfaz
Elchibey, was headed for victory in the presidential election that took
place on Sunday, Reuter reports from Baku.
A victory for Mr Elchibey, who is against participation in the Commonwealth
of Independent States (CIS), would distance Azerbaijan further from Moscow's
sphere of influence.

Financial Services Centre on the dockside walk briskly past, carefully
avoiding the gazes of men languishing on streetcorners or at the entrances
to bookmakers' shops. Ireland's unemployment rate now stands at just over 20
per cent, the highest in the European Community. On June 18 the country will
vote in a referendum to ratify or reject the Maastricht Treaty. Unemployment
is increasingly becoming the focus of the Maastricht debate.
Mr Albert Reynolds, the prime minister, spelt out the significance of the EC
for the Irish economy when he addressed a conference organised by the Irish
Congress of Trade Unions last month. 'The community takes three-quarters of
our total exports. Exports to our partners represent 42 per cent of our
national output. More than half the jobs in the state depend on our
continued access to the community market. Stronger growth in our community
partners, the removal of economic frontiers and Emu (European monetary
union) will therefore yield considerable benefits to this country,' he said.
He emphasised that the government attached 'the highest priority' to
cohesion in its proposals on the draft treaty. This is the principle that
the poorer member states, namely Spain, Portugal, Greece and Ireland, should
be net beneficiaries in the distribution of EC funds, to bring their living
standards gradually into line with the rest of the community.
For every pound that Ireland puts into the EC budget, it gets six back. In
1991, IPounds 2.2bn (Pounds 2bn) was transferred to Ireland under the Common
Agricultural Policy and the structural fund. Together they represent 6 per
cent of national income.
Since Ireland joined the EC in 1973, gross domestic product per capita has
risen from 59 per cent of the EC average to 69 per cent today. A recent
econometric study by the Economic and Social Research Institute (ESRI) in
Dublin estimates that by the year 2000 participation in the single market,
Emu and the structural fund will increase GDP to between 7 and 8 per cent
above what it would have been. The study assumed that structural and
cohesion funds remained at their current level.
Under the new Delors budget proposals, which would almost double the
structural and cohesion funds available to the four most disadvantaged
states, Ireland hopes to receive IPounds 6bn for the 1994-1998 period
compared to IPounds 3bn for 1989-1993.
But while these arguments are being used in an effort to convince the
Euro-cynics in the lead-up to the Maastricht referendum, many of the experts
also doubt whether cohesion funds are sufficient in themselves to create
economic convergence.
Mr Kieran Kennedy, director of the ESRI, says that Emu's emphasis on
institutional arrangements to control monetary policy, without a fiscal
authority of comparable weight, creates an inherent danger for Ireland.
'The outcome could be a macroeconomic policy that would weight the balance
excessively towards price stability at the expense of employment and output.
Protracted unemployment poses a more severe threat to the cohesion of our
own society, and to our role in the EC than to the gap in average income
between Ireland and the EC,' he says.
Mr Maurice Doyle, the central bank governor, said recently: 'Ireland would
seem to be vulnerable to country-specific shocks in that the structure of
the economy is quite different from the average European economy.' He
pointed to Ireland's high dependence on agriculture, the domination of the
industrial sector by foreign investment which is internationally mobile, and
a service sector strongly oriented towards domestic demand, making it
vulnerable to shocks in other sectors. 'I mention these factors to emphasise
the importance of economic cohesion for Ireland and the need for
community-wide policies and adjustment mechanisms to cope with the
inevitable shocks that the union will encounter.'
The Irish government's own resources are extremely limited. According to the
ESRI, in Ireland every 10 workers have to support on average 22 dependants,
whereas in Denmark, at the other extreme, every 10 workers have to support
only nine dependants. This gives it limited room for manoeuvre, either to
find the resources to deal with the existing level of unemployment, or the
effects of any shocks resulting from the single market and Emu.
Ireland has placed itself in the fast-track to Emu. This requires strict
fiscal and monetary discipline to keep down inflation, reduce borrowing and
cut government expenditure. Ireland is well on target for Emu but is
suffering rising unemployment and growing labour unrest. The government is
simultaneously attempting to reduce taxes to harmonise Ireland's tax regime
with that of its EC partners.
The EC structural and cohesion funds are thus vital to Ireland in order for
it to harmonise its economy with those of its 11 EC partners.
The dilemma is that the funds themselves are unlikely to be sufficient to
resolve Ireland's severe unemployment problems, but the alternative - to opt
out of Maastricht altogether - is even bleaker.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Lira faces renewed pressure

<TEXT>
THE Italian lira came under renewed pressure yesterday as the business and
financial community took stock of the impact of last week's Danish
referendum rejecting the Maastricht treaty.
At the same time, leading commercial banks raised their prime rate by half a
point to 13.5 per cent in response to last week's raising of rates by the
Bank of Italy.
In thin trading the lire was quoted at 756.4 against the D-Mark. This was
right against the Bank of Italy's unofficial floor for the currency. The
lira has hovered at this level since last Thursday when the markets first
reacted to the Danish referendum result. But yesterday the Bank of Italy did
not intervene by selling D-Marks as it did on Thursday and Friday last week.
'The situation surrounding the lira is complex and the markets continue to
be nervous,' Mr Rony Hamaui, head of research at Banca Commerciale Italiana
(Comit), said.
Last Thursday the Bank of Italy raised rates on short-term advances by half
a point to 13 per cent to protect the lira but refrained from a more
definitive move by increasing the discount rate. Yesterday, the Bank of
Italy also sought to squeeze liquidity by raising rates on repurchase
agreements with the banks. The rate being offered was 13.13 per cent, more
than 0.6 per cent above that of last Wednesday.
The commercial banks have felt obliged to raise their prime rates in
response. 'I don't know if the half point on the advances (by the Bank of
Italy) will be sufficient,' Mr Hamaui said. 'The Bank of Italy intervened
quickly and sought to anticipate things which could get worse.'
The main concern centred on whether the politicians' resolve to tackle
Italy's deteriorating public finances would be weakened by the Maastricht
crisis.

ALMOST three-quarters of Germans believe that Germany should have a
referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European political and economic
union, according to the latest opinion poll.
At the same time, 56 per cent of those questioned for Stern magazine, on the
day after Denmark voted against the Maastricht treaty on European union,
still favour the idea of union, but 72 per cent opposed the abolition of the
Deutsche Mark. Just 22 per cent were positively in favour of a single
European currency.
Some 70 per cent of those questioned by the Dortmund-based Forsa opinion
research institute said they believed Germany should retain its full
sovereignty to decide questions of foreign and security policy, social,
economic and financial policy - suggesting widespread ignorance of the
degree to which such responsibility has already been transferred to EC
institutions.
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the German foreign minister, rejected the growing pressure
for a German referendum on Maastricht, saying that such a vote was not
provided for in the German constitution.

<TEXT>
CYPRUS has heatedly denied that it has become a money-laundering centre for
illicit funds transferred from Yugoslavia by an increasingly beleaguered
Serbian regime.
Mr Andreas Philippou, a senior Central Bank of Cyprus official, yesterday
described reports of up to Dollars 750m (Pounds 412m) having been lodged in
Cyprus banks and front companies by Yugoslav nationals as a 'gross
exaggeration'.
'The amount of money deposited in Cyprus by Yugoslavs is nowhere near
Dollars 750m and not even a fraction of that,' said Mr Philippou, whose
responsibilities include supervision of banks and financial institutions on
the east Mediterranean island.
The Washington Post had reported that Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian
president, and associates had shifted millions of dollars recently to
Cypriot subsidiaries, protected by strict banking secrecy laws.
The newspaper raised the possibility that Mr Milosevic and his allies may
have been using Cyprus, with its thousands of registered offshore companies,
to circumvent United Nations trade and financial sanctions.
Mr Philippou angrily rejected suggestions that Cyprus had helped Serbian
nationalists defy UN sanctions. The government, he said, implemented UN
sanctions immediately and local financial institutions were under strict
instructions to freeze transfers of Yugoslav funds. The Bank of Cyprus
official said Yugoslavia's use of Cyprus as a trading post in the
Mediterranean and a centre for offshore companies had been 'going on for
years'. He estimated that Cyprus had some 8,000 offshore companies, but he
was unclear how many of these were Yugoslav-owned.
He described reports of huge sums being moved by Milosevic associates as
'rumour-mongering'. He insisted there had been no surge of financial
transfers since the troubles intensified in Yugoslavia.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE impact of United Nations sanctions imposed a week ago on Serbia and its
tiny ally Montenegro will bite much sooner than expected, according to Serb
economists and western diplomats.
They say this is because the Serbian government did not build up adequate
reserves of raw materials and spare parts, even though it saw how the war in
neighbouring Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina had severely disrupted the
entire transportation system throughout the former Yugoslavia.
The sanctions have forced the government of Montenegro to introduce petrol
rationing which took effect from last Saturday. Serbia is expected to follow
suit by issuing ration coupons this week.
In Montenegro, private car owners are allowed 30 litres of petrol a month,
transport vehicles 400 litres and tractors and taxis 250. In both republics,
the price of petrol increased last week by between 80 and 100 per cent. A
litre of petrol now costs 750 dinars or one US dollar at the official rate.
Serbia's oil fields produce between 20 per cent and 25 per cent of the
country's total needs. The rest was imported from Romania, Greece, Iran, and
the former Soviet Union. A Serb economist yesterday said Serbia might not be
able to keep domestic production at present levels. 'We were in the process
of concluding contracts for importing exploration equipment to maintain that
production. The sanctions put paid to that,' he said.
Serbia has abundant hydroelectric supplies. However, the sanctions mean that
Serbia will not be able to import turbines from Croatia, one of its
traditional suppliers. 'We do not have extra turbines. The sanctions show
just how inter-dependent the Yugoslav republics were,' the economist said.
He added that petrol shortages will exacerbate food price rises, because
petrol rationing could reduce the volume of food supplies coming into
Belgrade, the Serbian capital. Belgrade newspapers yesterday reported that
the price of 7,200 goods were increased last week. In addition, the
agricultural sector depends on imported chemicals and oil derivatives. Mr
Andras Vince, a Hungarian economist in Belgrade, said Hungary supplied
Serbia with the bulk of its chemical needs. The steel industry is likely to
be hit hard by sanctions. Any steel shortages could soon affect the arms
industry, and the military effectiveness of the Serbians.
For instance, the steel works in Niksic, Montenegro, produces between
250,000 and 280,000 tons of steel a year, including high quality alloyed
steel, most of which goes directly to the defence industry. Mr Samo
Markovic, an official at the Yugoslav Iron and Steel Federation, said the
plant had stockpiled only about 20 days of finished products.
'The steel mills are not self-sufficient,' said Mr Markovic. 'Serbia and the
other republics had to import almost all their iron ore and coke from
eastern Europe, the former Soviet Union, and Latin America,' he explained.

SECRECY yesterday surrounded plans for the first post-electoral meeting on
the future of the Czechoslovak federation.
Mr Vaclav Klaus, the federal finance minister and head of the Czech
delegation, is expected to meet Mr Vladimir Meciar, the Slovak leader, today
at an unknown venue somewhere between Prague and the Slovak capital,
Bratislava.
Mr Klaus was asked on Sunday night by the Czechoslovak president, Mr Vaclav
Havel, to begin negotiations to form a new federal government.
Mr Klaus and Mr Meciar will discuss the form of the future federal
government and the division of power between Czechs and Slovaks within it.
Mr Klaus has said he will reduce the federal government to a few key
ministries, such as finance, economics, foreign affairs and defence, but
this is likely to lead to clashes with the Slovaks, who want their republic
freed from federal control. The powers of the federal Finance Ministry will
be the subject of particularly fierce debate. Mr Klaus has said that fiscal
and economic policy must remain unified but Slovak nationalists have asked
for two central banks and said they intend to take full control over the
privatisation programme in their republic.
Mr Havel himself has seen his position as presidential candidate threatened
by the strong showing of the Slovak nationalist forces and the collapse of
the remnants of the Civic Movement which brought him to power after the 1989
revolution.
Mr Meciar said in Bratislava that he would ask his deputies in the federal
parliament to withdraw their support for Mr Havel's presidential
re-election. Other key policy makers, such as Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the
federal economics minister, and Mr Jiri Dienstbier, the federal foreign
affairs minister, will not be able to help Mr Havel as their parties failed
to win any seats in parliament.

FT  09 JUN 92 / Bosnian defence units launch counter-attack on Serbs

<TEXT>
Serb irregulars devastated Sarajevo with heavy shelling yesterday, leaving a
trail of destruction and fire in the Bosnian capital, but Moslem and Croat
defenders hit back hard for the first time in days.
In New York Mr Boutros Boutros-Ghali the UN Secretary-General, recommended
enlarging the 14,000-member United Nations peace-keeping force in Yugoslavia
by more than 1,100 troops to enable the UN to reopen the airport at Sarajevo
tin order to bring in humanitarian supplies.
Heavy explosions ripped through the heart of the capital and thick columns
of black smoke rose from burning buildings across the city, where some
300,000 residents are trapped.
More than 30 people were killed and 120 wounded over the weekend in some of
the worst fighting in a European capital since World War Two. Hospital
officials said at least eight had been killed on Monday.
Bosnian territorial defence units launched an unexpected counter-attack
against the heavily-armed Serb forces near an area where 40,000 Serb, Croat
and Moslem residents are trapped.
Sarajevo radio reported that more than 30 people were killed and 120 wounded
over the weekend. An estimated 5,300 people have died and 22,500 been
injured since the fighting broke out in the republic in April.
The territorial units include troops drawn from Sarajevo's close-knit ethnic
communities, including Moslems, Croats and lery left behind by the
Serb-dominated Yugoslav federal army units which withdrew from a central
barracks in the city last Friday. Ms Gordana Kenezevac, a journalist from
Oslobedjne, the Bosnian daily said:'Everybody is fighting to save their
city. Mathematicians and students, fathers and sons, sportsmen and office
workers.'
'Even though we have no food or medicine, we will not surrender to Karadzic
and his forces.' Ancient parts of Sarajevo were burning after yesterday's
shelling from Serb positions in hills surrounding the city. The medieval
Serb orthodox church, the Holy Trinity catholic church and the Ali Pasha
mosque, all located in the capital's old quarter, were destroyed.
In New York there was progress on plans for the United Nations to take
control of the capital's airport which Serbian militia have blockaded for
the past nine weeks.
The blockade of the airport and the main road links into Sarajevo has
prevented any food and medical supplies from reaching the 300,000 Moslem,
Serb, and Croat inhabitants of the city, which has been under siege for over
two months.
If it goes ahead, the UN plan to secure Sarajevo's airport, which was agreed
in principle at the weekend between the Bosnian government, Serb forces, and
UN officials, will allow UN troops to impose a 10km ring around the airport.
They will also secure two 20km-long corridors from the ring into parts of
Sarajevo.

'All of management is integrally connected with time management,' one of
Britain's few management gurus, Professor John Adair once said. It should
not be surprising therefore, that in an attempt to improve Time Management,
he has produced an integrated system on the subject.
The Filofax-type package, called The Keytime Management System, is at
present sold only in one (desk) size, but the manufacturers are considering
other sizes. It is one of the best of the many such systems available, and
the manufacturers assure me that they are attending to the only problem I
have spotted so far: one is likely to lose the highlighter, as it does not
fit its holder properly. It comes with an introduction to the system
designed by Professor Adair, and the company offers the system by itself or
in conjunction with Adair-designed and -approved seminars on time management
which it runs in-company.

By contrast, scenario-planning is fashionable, and Professor Bill Weinstein

There may be no such thing as a free lunch, and one certainly does not find
many free products which can be recommended, but Pharos is an 'expert'
computer programme produced by NatWest and designed to help you assess how
your business will be affected by the Single European Market, and what
strategic or operational actions your company should address.
The programme helps you build a profile of your company and analyse your
business from several key perspectives. It then highlights key issues,
explains their relevance, suggests courses of action, and advises on sources
of information. Best of all, Pharos enables you to keep up to date with
changing legislation by means of a twice yearly update: NatWest has
announced that the first of these will deal specifically with business
responses to UK and European environmental issues. Update3 cost Pounds 40 +
VAT for customers of NatWest, of Ernst &amp; Young and for CBI members: all
other businesses must pay Pounds 125 + VAT.

Another company diagnostic tool in relation to the Single Market, though a
workbook rather than a computer program, is Euro-Train (Pounds 70 for single
copies, multiple copies cheaper). The second volume consists of a regional
listing of information sources. The focus is on helping you examine your
commercial, production, human resource and strategic profile and identify
actions you need to take. Both Euro-Train and Pharos have arrived in the
market late, but their appearance is still welcome.

The Prime Minister's Opportunity 2000 campaign is only a small part of an

schoolgirls to top bankers, furniture removers to a dress designer, have
broken through the invisible barriers which have kept women from jobs

To help with decision-making and team-work, Training Business Products has

Simple in format, using cards and discussion groups, the game is
surprisingly effective in drawing out key problems in existing groups for
discussion and analysis. Gower's more complex but equally effective business
game on a similar theme, called Top Team, is ideally suited to middle
managers and can also be used to tackle problem-solving, communication and
time-management. This game is played by between 16 and 24 participants; both
games last an hour to an hour and a half.

Sold] is the BBC's video-based guide to consultative selling, a concept
which was originally pioneered by the Huthwaite Research Group but which has

so there has not been much good material on the subject, and nothing good on

WHAT ARE we to make of the environment? If the general message in the
torrent of titles brought out to coincide with the Earth Summit is anything
to go by, the planet will be lucky to survive far into the next century. But
who really believes that? If the sense of alarm was that acute, Rio would
produce action rather than, as seems to be the case, mere words.
Dare I say that having read a large number of 'green' books I remain
relatively unmoved by the dangers to the planet which they describe.
Doubtless this is because I am part of the problem which many of these
authors identify: a tendency to ostrich-like behaviour. But I am talking
about a literary rather than a scientific problem. I do not doubt that the
environment faces grave dangers. But I cannot ignore a dulling sameness in
these books: the reiterated facts about the threats to land, water and air,
the same complaints about political inaction, the same calls for 'global
solutions'. What one is looking for is a flash of insight, a ring of truth.
The five titles above are among the more illuminating of the genre. Two, The
Third Revolution and Beyond the Limits, are good introductions to the
issues. Beyond the Limits is a sequel to The Limits to Growth, which
appeared 20 years ago. The authors revisit the subject, using the same
computer model with which they made their earlier predictions that the world
was on an unsustainable path.
What makes this book valuable is that it contains 14 scenarios for the
planet's future, using different assumptions for variables such as
population and economic growth. This allows the reader to apply his own
imagination to the problem with much more instructive results than the
'global disaster' approach.
Paul Harrison's thesis is that rising tensions between the rich and poor
worlds are the biggest threat. A compelling writer, he supports this with
first-hand accounts of life among the world's underprivileged and
dispossessed: the Madagascan peasant who has to slash and burn the forest to
survive, the poor of Abidjan. Unlike history's earlier revolutions - caused
by shortages - the third revolution of the title will be caused by waste and
wasting.
Ultimately, the worry about the environment is a worry about extinction. But
in The Miner's Canary Niles Eldredge reminds us that it is not an uncommon
phenomenon, that it has a stimulating effect on evolution - and that we are
probably due for another mass extinction pretty soon anyway, based purely on
averages.
The real question, though, is whether homo sapiens' meddling with the
environment puts a new complexion on extinction. Unfortunately Eldredge
ducks out at this point. 'It is not easy, in general, to tell human from
non-human agency in the ongoing destruction of the modern biota,' he writes.
(The book is not as turgid as that one quote suggests). However, Eldredge
clearly wants us to worry about man's interference with nature and our
ability to bring mass extinction upon ourselves.
So what are the solutions?
This is the point at which one is looking for realism. It is too easy to
demand a global action plan, or bemoan the lack of political will. Yet this
is what most green books do, with the sort of disappointing result one sees
in Rio.
At least Al Gore, a member of the US Senate, is close to the political
action. Earth in the Balance is a readable, passionate account of the
problem. But it echoes his own frustration at the failure of public opinion
to stir greater action at governmental level. He has his theories for this.
One is technological hubris: we think we can fix the problem. Another is
that our civilisation has become addicted to consumption and, like all
addicts, we react irrationally. We can even deny that the problem exists.
But Gore also belongs to the global solution school. He calls for an
environmental 'Marshall Plan', backed by annual summit meetings, with a
number of strategic goals to stabilise the population, develop appropriate
technology and measure the impact of decisions on the environment better.
Shridath Ramphal is also close to government. A former foreign minister of
Guyana and for 15 years secretary-general of the Commonwealth, he brings a
Third World perspective to the debate in Our Country the Planet. The 'feudal
relationship' between rich and poor countries is the big culprit in his
view. For him, the choice lies between muddling through, creating a new form
of imperialism in which strong countries tell the weak how to behave, or his
preferred route of 'enlightened change'.
Big issues, all of them. And if nothing else, Rio has stimulated debate and
educated millions to what is at stake. But the green literary genre remains
one-sided. I still await the book that hits home.

INFLUENCING THE EUROPEAN COMMUNITY by Cecilia Andersen Kogan Page Pounds 35,
349 pages
IF the EBIC and the CVMP (more anon) leave you cold or, worse, ignorant,
then this highly practical and informative work is for you. It is, in a real
sense, a definitive business book; it contains hard business news, or at
least tells you what to look for, and where - often down to detailed
addresses and telephone numbers - if your company or organisation is doing
business in Europe.
The European Community increasingly affects the operational environment of
all firms doing business in it. Corporations big and small need to influence
European policies before they are finalised, and it is argued cogently in
this study that the Commission in Brussels needs to consult widely with
business in advance of policy decisions. Bureaucrats with little or no
knowledge of the real world of business will make bad decisions if business
does not seek to influence policies before they are finalised. Companies
should be plugging into the thinking of the Brussels Commission long before
it gets to the doing stage; early information and lobbying should be the
name of the game.
Cecilia Andersen's work, aided by a lot of detailed research by some of her
students at Boston University in Brussels, certainly shows the way, even
down to telephone numbers for accessing Community data bases, and it
contains interesting mini case histories of some of the more successful
commercial lobbying operations on behalf of the European automobile
industry, food and drink manufacturers and the big pharmaceutical companies.
The Japanese Automobile Manufacturers' Association was quick to learn; it
moved its main European office from Paris to Brussels in 1990.
Andersen, a consultant to a number of major multinational companies (by her
own terms, a lobbyist) and a professor at Antwerp University, insists that
business involvement in Community decisions requires that companies
determine what they want to achieve, know the openings provided by the
Community policy-making structure, and use established if not always
well-known channels to express their views.
This approach should not be at the margins of corporate policy but at the
very core of strategic planning. She illustrates the case of the Swiss
pharmaceuticals giant, Bayer, which set up a special Steering Committee
1992, chaired by a main board member, to study - and seek to influence -
European Commission policies. 'The task of the committee was to formulate
and propose Bayer's strategies and to support decision-making. Members fed
into the committee their analyses and judgments on new proposals and draft
regulations. The committee identified issues and allocated them to
appropriate committees or working groups. At corporate level, issues such as
procurement and energy, anti-trust legislation, finance, tax, and insurance
were analysed. Various sectors of the company, business groups, and regional
organisations studied the impact of 1992 on production, sales and marketing,
acquisitions and logistics.'
But the business world is not made up of big Bayers. This book also
addresses the needs of small businesses, and points them in some useful
directions, such as the need to plug into trade associations, and indeed to
encourage them in turn to link with collective lobbying agencies in Brussels
 -often staffed by former employees of the Commission. The larger firms of
accountants and lawyers now have offices in Brussels and offer both advisory
and consultancy services.
The European Commission itself maintains almost 200 Euro-Info-Centres
throughout the Community providing 'cheap sources of information, rapid,
up-to-date information on the internal market and on all Community services
for enterprise'. The book stops short of listing all the centres, but it
does contain a lot of useful addresses; it is a near-essential item on any
corporate book shelf.
(As for EBIC and CVMP: respectively, the European Business and Innovation
Centre and the Committee for Veterinary Medicinal Products . . . and
Andersen will tell you a lot which is even more useful.)

PROFITING FROM INNOVATION edited by William G Howard and Bruce R Guile The
Free Press Pounds 15.95, 150 pages
ON BOTH sides of the Atlantic, corporate research and development
departments are renowned for their innovation and technological
breakthroughs. They are equally famous for their frequent failure to bring
the fruits of these brain-waves to market.
This is not a new problem. In 1967 an advisory panel of US technical
business leaders chaired by Robert Charpie, then President of Union Carbide
Electronics, produced a report in which one of the main conclusions was that
a major effort should be made to help managers and executives to 'learn,
feel, understand and appreciate how technological innovation is spawned,
nurtured, financed and managed . . . ' But two decades later American
business was still chalking up failures, exemplified by the success of
foreign competitors in the steel, car, consumer electronics, semiconductors
and production equipment sectors.
It was against this background in the late 1980s that the Washington-based
National Academy of Engineering set up the nine-man study committee on
'Profiting from Innovation' chaired by William Howard Jr, a former corporate
director of research at Motorola.
At the end of the three-year study the committee could have produced a
weighty account of its findings which no doubt would have been highly
praised - and then consigned to the shelf to gather dust. Instead, Howard
and Bruce Guile, director of the Academy's programme office, have produced a
nuts-and-bolts handbook to 'demonstrate how managing technical resources is
as important to the paper clip business as it is to microelectronics,' and
which succeeds in describing and illustrating tools and techniques to help
managers commercialise technology.
The book is peppered with examples, including some of some of the most
notable, such as the legendary failure of Xerox to recognise the commercial
potential of the Alto, the first personal computer, built by researchers at
its Palo Alto Research Centre (Parc) in 1973, long before Apple and IBM
began putting PCs on desktops.
But the book is not just a catalogue of good and bad practise. It analyses
how innovation occurs in cycles; how, in the early stages of a new
technology, the value lies in identifying applications and getting products
to market; how,later, it is essential to make improvements quicker than
others; and it stresses that a static monopoly of a particular technology is
unsustainable in the long term.
This book is not just for academics; it is also a practical guide to help
managers and engineers become better at managing and exploiting technology.
It continues where the Charpie Report left off.

QUALITY: CHANGE THROUGH TEAMWORK by Chaudhry-Lawton, Lawton, Murphy and
Terry Century Business/Sunday Times Pounds 20, 318 pages
MANAGING INTERNATIONAL TEAMS by Nicola Phillips Financial Times/Pitman Books
Pounds 30, 198 pages
TEAMWORK, quality and customer service are three of the obvious top
half-dozen managerial priorities of the early 1990s. So one does not need to
smell conspiracy at the discovery that two of Britain's leading newspapers,
the Sunday Times and the Financial Times, have each chosen these topics as
part of their first real involvement in popular business book publishing.
In partnership with Century Business, the Sunday Times' trio of books form
part of a first batch of five volumes in its new 'Business Skills' series of
training packages. These comprise the books, two videos and a work book on
each topic. The other two initial titles are on time management and
effective meetings. The books are of good quality (the one reviewed here is
excellent), but take second place in the company's promotional campaign to
the video-based courses. Some of the books go well beyond the basics (though
these are very much their focus), and cost only Pounds 20 - quite low for
business hardbacks.
By contrast, the FT's involvement in the arena, in partnership with Pitman
Publishing, is with a self-standing series of hardbacks priced mainly around
Pounds 30. Under the title 'Books for Business', the series is an
international one, in both content and authorship - a number of the planned
titles are by Continental Europeans. This is a refreshing departure from the
convention of English language business books 'having' to be written by
either Americans or Britons. In addition to quality, teamwork, and customer
service (which commands two launch titles), the other two initial topics are
the marketing of professional services, and an investor's guide to warrants.
Even if the two series are not as directly competitive as they may seem, why
should two such strong newspaper titles get involved with popular business
books in the midst of a recession? The short answers are that the recession
arrived after the planning had been done; that the financial risk is being
borne by Century Business and Pitman, rather than by the newspapers; and
that sales of educational business books seem to hold up well in recession,
as companies and individuals trade down from business school courses.
Both newspapers have got involved in the sector because of the maturing of
the business books' market, at least in Britain. Several years ago, when the
enterprise society was in its first flush of youth, it was looking for
blockbusters by million-selling gurus and business leaders such as Lee
Iacocca. Now, with the exception of such American-based giants as Peter
Drucker and Tom Peters, plus home-grown equivalents such as Charles Handy
and Sir John Harvey-Jones, the market has fragmented into a host of detailed
subject areas. In the words of one publisher, 'people are now looking not
just for exhortation, but either for practical information or for a
combination of the two.' The market potential is obvious.
How do the two new series measure up to this objective? Reasonably well,
each on its own terms, Both have a smattering of quirks, to judge from the
initial volumes, which are irritating or attractive depending on your point
of view. The Sunday Times/Century Business have slapped a fashionable
'quality' surtitle on three of their volumes, whereas only one hits that
subject squarely. The other two, on total customer service, and change
through teamwork, cover a far broader ground than just quality, and are all
the more worth reading for that.
The Sunday Times/Century Business book on Quality: Change Through Teamwork
(appropriately by a team of four authors) is especially useful. It deals
simply but thoroughly with a broad canvas of detailed issues: when to use
teams; how to create them with a balanced set of skills appropriate to each
particular task and context; and the need for team leadership to adapt
itself to varying circumstances. It also advises on how to accelerate team
processes. And, having listed a series of tell-tale signs of an ineffective
team, it suggests a series of practical trouble-shooting techniques.
If the Sunday Times/Century Business title writers went over the top in
slapping a 'quality' label on their teamwork book, their FT/Pitman
counterparts did an over-simplification job with their equivalent book,
which they called Managing International Teams. Written by a single author,
it is a stimulating and helpful exercise in the journalistic digestion of a
wide range of research by academics and others on several complex subjects.
But the book is at least half about the effect which differences in national
culture have on the attitudes, motivation, behaviour and leadership styles
of individual managers.
When, halfway through the book, the author turns fully to the subject of
teamwork, her international content tails off, and she concentrates mainly
on the generic mechanics of all types of team. That the two strands of the
book are not sufficiently interwoven may be because of the paucity of
evidence: few companies have much experience of operating successful
cross-cultural teams, and even fewer expert observers have studied them.
All the same, the book contains several instructive case studies and
anecdotes. One gem is the story of a Japanese member of a mainly American
team who, in order to 'belong' to it, created for himself the nickname of
'Fast Eddie'. But after the probing of a culturally sensitive team leader
(one of the book's hero types), it emerged that he preferred the more
respectful title of 'Endo-san'.
The story epitomises one of the main lessons of the book: that multinational
companies do themselves a disservice by trying to impose a monolithic global
corporate culture. Instead, it rams home the point that they will be more
creative and competitive if they try to work with the different national
assumptions and values of their various team members.

POWER: CREATING IT, USING IT by Helga Drummond Kogan Page Pounds 10.95, 228
pages
HOW TO BE HEADHUNTED by Yvonne Sarch Century Business Pounds 7.99, 210 pages
HELGA DRUMMOND'S latest manual cleverly appeals to the devil and the angel
in all of us. A no-holds-barred 'guerrilla handbook' for anyone wanting to
get to the top in the corporate jungle? Or a common-sense plea for the
constructive benefits of using power wisely, on the view that 'power is not
about empire-building and personal aggrandisement. It is about enabling
managers to do their jobs instead of 'draining vital productive energy into
going around in circles'?
The problem with power is that it is both these things. Dr Drummond wisely
leaves the choice up to the reader. If you have been unable to read a report
for a meeting and consequently worry about being unable to answer questions,
her tip is to grab a highlighter pen, randomly isolate a few paragraphs and
scribble a few irritable looking notes in the margin. If you do this, and
then open the document on the table, no one will dare ask you anything for
fear of incurring a blistering response.
'The fact that you may have highlighted insignificant parts of the report or
written 'Rubbish]' against perfectly sensible passages adds to strength
because it makes others believe that your analysis is more penetrating than
theirs]'
Is this meant for the unscrupulous board-room bounder or the hard-pressed
corporate worthy? Although Drummond tries hard to distinguish between the
wise and the vicious uses of power, her illustrations nicely point up its
paradox by blurring the distinction.
Drummond's path to power is lined with good advice: aim to be mysterious,
restrict socialisation, cultivate unpredictability; divide and rule, keep
your options open, practise eternal vigilance and watch for clues in those
around you ('someone who regularly has bags under his eyes, or whose hands
shake, for example, is under strain, whatever he might say.').
Create a reputation for decisiveness, even by over-acting on small issues;
learn to be decisive and obstructive ('I only wish I could'); delegate the
difficult jobs to rivals; be diplomatic, compensate for other's
deficiencies; and never retract - 'if you put your foot in it, leave it
there.'
Never reveal yourself in an unguarded moment: Princess Margaret's scandalous
involvement with Peter Townsend was deduced by onlookers when she brushed
dandruff from his shoulders during the coronation.
Drummond is not afraid of the gruesome comparison: 'The Romans used to say,
to assassinate someone, first get close to them.'
Always offer the other party a way out: 'The torturers of the Spanish
Inquisition, for example, always kept a confession ready by the rack for
signature.'
If you have read Drummond's book and still not reached the top, then it can
only be because you have been murdered by a colleague whose deficiencies you
forgot to allow for.
However, you can exit in another way: by being headhunted. How to be
Headhunted, written by a top executive search consultant, covers much the
same ground, though in a less lively way.
The secrets are to build your profile, 'network' by developing contacts who
can assist your career progression, develop the stamina to succeed, broaden
your experience, and manage change.
It also helps to be seen to contribute to the bottom line. You will not be
headhunted until you have developed a clear strategy for your career success
and consolidated a reputation for achievement, inside and outside the
office.
Both books contain checklists and summaries to help prospective
power-seekers chronicle their progress. The lesson is plain. As one artistic
drop-out put it: 'There is a tide in the affairs of men, Which, taken at the
flood, leads on to fortune.'

JAPANESE INDUSTRIAL TARGETING by William R Hester Macmillan Pounds 45, 297
pages
JAPANESE ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT: THEORY AND PRACTICE by Penelope Francks
Routledge Pounds 12.99, 320 pages
WILLIAM HESTER examines Japan's economic 'miracle' and demolishes the
country's claims that it was the culmination of hard work and free market
enterprise. It was, asserts Hester, the result of neo-mercantile policies,
targeting of carefully selected industries backed by cartels, subsidies,
incentives to export and barriers to import.
It is a remorseless, humourless account, largely derived from other people's
research. He does not try to explain how and why Japan was successful,
whereas other countries tried to guide development and fell flat on their
faces. Occasionally Hester slips up, for example when he claims that the
Bank of Japan governor and his deputy always come from the Ministry of
Finance. (In fact career Bank officials have provided two of the last three
governors).
Francks sets Japan's post-war economic miracle in its historical framework,
going back to examine the Meiji and pre-Meiji roots of growth. Her
schoolmarmish approach and determination to see what lessons Japan affords
for other countries grate from time to time. Never the less, she makes a
useful contribution to the debate about how and why Japan was so successful.
She points out that Japan's is no monolithic 'developmental state' and that
state intervention is not the answer for its success. Her conclusions are
limited but important. Japan can offer lessons for the Third World that the
West cannot. But attempts to follow Japan are leading to friction and fear.
It is doubtful whether Francks' attempt to lend perspective will allay this.

INTERNATIONAL LABOUR AND THE ORIGINS OF THE COLD WAR by Denis MacShane
Clarendon Press, Pounds 37.50, 324 pages
ONE OF the side effects of the collapse of communism has been the triumph of
the western International Confederation of Free Trade Unions over the
Soviet-dominated World Federation of Trade Unions.
Few people have heard of either. Most of those aware of their existence
probably assume that they provided an excuse for senior trade unionists from
the respective blocs to eat and drink at their members' expense in exotic
locations.
But co-operation between unions across national borders is, especially
inside the European Community, an increasingly serious business. Indeed, one
of the reasons for the UK's 'opt-out' from an extension of EC employment
policy at last year's Maastricht summit was the fear of Europe-wide
collective bargaining between the European Trades Union Congress and UNICE,
the European employer's body.
Denis MacShane's book about the trade union internationals and the start of
the Cold War was completed too soon for reflections on the end of the Cold
War, and is too narrowly focused for a discussion of current developments in
the EC. But a good polemical journalist like MacShane, who has spent much of
the last decade working for the International Metalworkers Federation, might
have been expected to tell us what the union internationals are for and what
they have ever achieved.
Instead he serves up a mass of detail which seeks to overturn various
supposed orthodoxies of international trade union history, and swipes
unpleasantly at his fellow trade union historians for their myopia,
arrogance, or 'essentialism' in the Cold War debate.
His main, unremarkable, thesis is that the Cold War was not 'external' to
the unions and that the split in the WFTU after 1945 stemmed from an older
split between communist and socialist unions going back to 1917.
The same could be said of the Cold War itself. It was the co-operation
between the Allies and the Soviet Union between 1941 and 1945 that was the
exception. The east-west, or communist-capitalist, contest became more
menacing after 1945 only because the Soviet Union had become a super-power
and occupied a larger part of the globe.
MacShane fails to show that the internationals ever had any effect on
anything or had a class dynamic of their own transcending the nation state.
But after all those years rummaging in the trade union archives he has
convinced himself that organisations such as the WFTU and the ICFTU were in
fact major historical actors, and might even have started the Cold War
themselves. 'The confrontation within trade unions domestically and
internationally was one of the causes rather than a consequence of the Cold
War', he claims.
The discussion of French and German trade unionism just after the war is
more diverting. German trade unionists still seethe when they hear the
self-congratulatory British story about how the British occupiers
established west Germany's model system of industrial relations. In fact, as
MacShane points out, both works councils and industrial unionism had roots
in the Weimar Republic and the TUC had no blueprint and not much influence
over what was established in the late 1940s.
But MacShane undermines his thesis that the Germans did it all for
themselves by pointing out that the most influential German union leaders
wanted a single trade union for all workers and it was only the opposition
of the British, including the TUC, that prevented that and allowed the
creation of industrial unions. The opposition was based on the
unsophisticated argument that the Germans were inherently authoritarian and
would slavishly obey the orders of a mega-union.
Occasionally MacShane allows a touch of humanity to slip through the turgid
detail. During the First World War, for example, the International
Metalworkers Review continued to appear printed in three parallel columns of
English, German and French. 'While troops died in the trenches, metal union
officials could read of British or German legislation or union initiatives
to protect workers in the home factories.'
MacShane has also done his footwork, locating men like Eddie Frow, a leading
communist in the UK's Amalgamated Engineering Union in 1946. But the only
man who briefly comes alive is Jack Tanner, president of the AEU from 1939
to 1954, and the only member of the TUC General Council in the 1940s and
1950s to have attended the second congress of the Communist International in
Moscow in 1920, the founding moment of the world communist movement.
It is a pity that MacShane allows himself to get bogged down in heaping fact
on meaningless fact, in support of an uncontroversial thesis, instead of
telling us more about men like Tanner.

BUSINESS ORGANISATION AND THE MYTH OF THE MARKET ECONOMY by William Lazonick
Cambridge Pounds 24.95, 372 pages
WHY WAS Britain, the first industrial nation, overtaken by the US in the
early 20th century, and why has Japan taken the lead in the last 30 years?
For William Lazonick, an American economist and business historian, the
answers to these questions have to do with changes in the institutional
character of capitalism and, in particular, in the organisational
capabilities of the business firm.
Thus Britain's rise to economic dominance in the 19th century was
characterised by small, vertically integrated, family-owned firms. As
markets and technologies changed, this fragmented structure proved inferior
to the large, professionally managed, multi-divisional corporations which
emerged in the US. The American version of managerial capitalism dominated
the international economy from the 1920s to the 1960s.
Japan has improved on the American model by moving towards what Lazonick
calls 'collective capitalism'. Leading Japanese firms outperform their US
counterparts because of a superior form of managerial organisation. The
Japanese are able to organise cooperative investment strategies across firms
(through the keiretsu system) and to improve coordination within firms by
involving blue-collar workers in decision-making. These arrangements are
reinforced by a financial system which encourages long-term investment.
Neoclassical economists, Lazonick argues, have failed to understand, or even
to take an interest in, the link between business organisation and national
economic performance. The text book theory of the company 'takes as given
the technological and organisational capabilities of the business
enterprise. Yet it is changes in these capabilities that are the essence of
the development process'.
Central to Lazonick's approach is his view that 'organisational coordination
has increasingly replaced market coordination in the value-creation
process'. Through their attachment to the myth of the market economy
economists 'have failed to develop a theory of economic development that can
explain the nature and causes of the wealth of nations'.
Despite the pioneering work of Alfred Chandler, the business historian,
there has been no serious attempt to link business history with economic
theory. Because of the neglect of history, 'mainstream economics currently
propounds a view of economic activity that grossly misconceives reality'.
The separation from reality, Lazonick suggests, is reflected in the abstract
mathematical models that fill the economic journals and are presented as
economic science. 'The ability of economists to use mathematical technique
has far outrun their understanding of economic reality'.
Lazonick outlines his own theory of the 'innovative business organisation'.
Capitalist development, he says, is a process which combines innovative
strategy with organisational structure to alter existing technological and
social constraints on superior economic performance. The success of Japanese
companies is based in part on the ability to transform the traditional
division of labour between managers and workers as well as the skills and
attitudes of workers themselves. They have moved from a structure of work
organisation based on control to one based on commitment.
Although Lazonick may overstate the link between the organisational ability
of firms and economic performance, he is surely right to see the process by
which companies gain and lose competitive advantage not as a mere 'residual'
but as a crucial element in economic performance which deserves study. While
the book is aimed at economists, it is non-technical and draws on the
author's deep knowledge of business history. It contains insights and
arguments which the business reader will find stimulating and provocative.

FT  09 JUN 92 / The FT Review of Business Books (13): IBM's humble pie -
Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SILVERLAKE PROJECT by Roy Bauer et al. Oxford Pounds 20, 236 pages
SILVERLAKE illustrates how to eat humble pie without suffering indigestion
in public. The eponymous lake is a lagoon in Rochester, Minnesota, a sleepy
mid-Western town famous for wheat and the Mayo Clinic. It is also the
internal code name for a family of computers which International Business
Machines (IBM) designed there between 1985 and 1988.
The computers, the mid-range AS/400 family, are now among the most
successful products that IBM, the world's largest computer manufacturer, has
developed. Silverlake is not, however, about technology. Rather, it is a
study of how IBM, the archetypal market-driven company, lost contact with
customers and markets in the 1980s and the measures it has been forced to
adopt to retrieve the situation.
On the way, IBM Rochester was awarded America's prime business quality
accolade, the Malcolm Baldridge Award. This is no empty honour, but the
measure of a world class operation. The feat which won Rochester the
Baldridge was to build a competitive, innovative computer family in two
years rather than the usual four, turning many of IBM's shibboleths on their
heads in the process. IBM worshipped technological excellence; Rochester
asked customers what they wanted and gave it to them. IBM made a religion of
secrecy; almost everything about Silverlake was known before it was
launched, through innumerable meetings with customers, the press and
software developers. IBM was stiffly hierarchical; Rochester gave its people
authority and the resources to make their decisions count. IBM is now
attempting to spread these ideas through the rest of the company.
Silverlake the Computer is a product of endless working groups and
troubleshooting teams. Silverlake the Book, seems to have been produced the
same way. Three of the key Rochester executives collaborated in the writing
as well as Jerry Wind, Lauder Professor at the Wharton Business School, and
Patrick Houston, a writer seemingly employed to knock the manuscript into
shape.
The result, alas, is dry and two dimensional. It fulfils neither the role of
continuous narrative nor management text, although it aspires to both. (It
lists, for example, ten principles of general management which contributed
to Rochester's success and which the authors believe have general
applicability.)
It is no Soul of a New Machine, Tracy Kidder's rollicking book about Data
General in the 1970s. Silverlake's characters are crudely drawn and left
emaciated on the page. The director of the Rochester development laboratory,
Tom Furey, for example, is given credit for developing the vision which
inspired the Silverlake development. Yet little is said to explain the
motivation or leadership qualities of this pivotal character.
On the other hand, much is made of the isolation of Rochester, of the
feelings among executives there that they were staffing an outpost of the
empire of which not much was expected. One wonders whether it was easier for
these self-confessed 'hicks . . . as far removed from the power centres of
corporate America as you could get' to expose the sluggishness, marketing
ineptitude and technological arrogance which remain at the root of IBM's
problems, than for those at the centre of the company.
I visited Rochester once and was duly impressed by its sense of pride in its
Baldridge Award. The fine lettering commemorating the award on a
complimentary, US-made ballpoint pen wore off within days.

ALTERNATIVE ECONOMIC INDICATORS by Victor Anderson Routledge Pounds
30/Pounds 8.99, 106 pages
THE TAIL-END of a lingering UK recession and world economic slowdown is
perhaps not the best time to publish a book arguing that mainstream
economics has put too much emphasis on the importance of economic growth.
The current slowdown has spurned a rash of alternative economic indicators
of growth, claiming to spot the recovery before it shows up in official
government statistics. But Victor Anderson's book instead provides a number
of alternatives to economic growth as measures of economic well-being.
Yet Anderson, a researcher at the New Economics Foundation, has not produced
another green growth-bashing tract. Instead he argues for a middle ground
between maximising growth and abandoning it as a goal altogether.
His thesis is that by pursuing the maximisation of the monetary value of
physical production, 20th century economic analysis has neglected the
intrinsic value of human beings and their interaction, and the need to
protect and preserve the natural world. 'Narrowly financial criteria have
ruled economic policy-making for too long. It is time to bring human and
environmental realities back into economics.'
His initial objective, Anderson admits, had been to find a single statistic
'which could dethrone and replace the rate of growth of gross national
product as the principal indicator.' But this mega-statistic proved elusive.
Instead the book details 14 indicators which he argues could be considered
alongside economic growth in evaluating economic outcomes. The tables cover
the seven largest industrialised countries and the seven most populous
non-industrialised countries. The alternative indicators include: primary
school enrolment, literacy, calorie intake, telephones per person, carbon
dioxide emission and operable nuclear reactors.
Not all these objectives can be met simultaneously. Indeed, the book
provides few answers, except to make the rather obvious point that both the
'anti-growthists' and the 'pro-growthists' take too partial a view. But the
tables are interesting.

the end of history - Trade

EXPORT CONTROLS IN TRANSITION edited by Gary Bertsch and Syeven
Elliott-Gower Duke Univ. Press Pounds 54.65/Pounds 20.85, 355 pages
ONE HAS TO make forgive the authors for apparently deciding to end history
with the reduction of East-West strategic trade controls agreed in 1990. So
much has happened since that it grates to read about the 'Soviet' threat.
It is worth overcoming this. The book becomes interesting not so much for
what it prescribes for the future, but more for its analysis of the mesh
between security and trade policy.
The basic justification for the strategic export controls introduced after
World War Two was that technological superiority would give the US and its
allies a defence edge over the Soviet Empire. The US defence establishment
was also able to drive that technological advance because it was the main
customer of US high-technology industries, which dominated world markets.
By the 1980s this had changed. There was a greater civilian application of
high-technology processes. Technological skills spread through the
industrial world. During the last decade military procurement represented
only 10 per cent of the US semiconductor market. The US Department of
Defense had stopped being a leader of innovation.
One consequence was that US companies lost their competitive edge to
Japanese counterparts. US national security was threatened because
indigenous firms could not supply the technological goods the military
required.
Against this it is easier to understand the US debate on export controls.
One response to worries about declining innovative skills was to redouble
efforts to impede Soviet advances. That meant reinforcing controls and
ensuring that they were applied rigorously by other countries.
On the other hand, there was a growing feeling that the controls were
counterproductive. They were weakening the ability of US companies to
compete globally. In 1987 the US National Academy of Sciences estimated that
US companies were losing Dollars 9bn (Pounds 5bn) a year in sales because of
the controls. There was a further loss of Dollars 6bn in sales to Western
companies which had stopped buying US components because of re-export
restrictions imposed by Washington. It was thus possible to argue that it
was in the interest of US national security that a reduction in controls
would strengthen domestic industry and national security.
This school came to dominate. Moreover, the desire by European countries to
liberalise technology trade with the reforming East bloc was so strong that
international cooperation would have become impossible had not the US agreed
to soften its hard line. This is not say that liberalisation has proved
easy.
One prime political objective of easing trade restrictions with former
communist countries is to give them access to the technology and
infrastructure needed to be generate a level of prosperity that will sustain
democratic reform.
Central to the development of any modern economy is telecommunications, but
modern telecommunications can be turned to military use. Since the most
advanced communications are almost impossible to tap, the prospect of their
falling into the hands of a potential enemy is worrying. Yet for the same
reason, access to secure communications also strengthens opposition groups
and could reinforce democracy in the former Eastern bloc.
Export controls can also play into the hands of protectionists whose
concerns are unrelated to security - arguably the case with US sanctions
against Japan's Toshiba company after it was discovered to have sold
submarine manufacturing technology to the then Soviet Union.
The conclusion remains that export controls are still needed. There is no
guarantee that Russia will remain friendly. Future controls will have to
involve sensitive application of a consensus surrounding a limited number of
processes and products. As for the US, it needs to rationalise the dispersed
bureaucracy that has been responsible for the controls.
Whether that will suffice to produce an effective system is another matter.
As the authors admit, technological skills are widely available even in
newly-industrialising countries. Finally, one question is barely addressed:
how does the West keep dangerous technology out of the hands of madcap
dictators such as Saddam Hussein? Maybe that question is altogether too
difficult. If so, it is a pity, since that is where the threat increasingly
seems to lie.

SWITZERLAND AND THE EUROPEAN COMMON MARKET by Rene Schwok Praeger Publishers
Pounds 34.50, 131 pages
THERE IS NO disguising the chauvinism which underlies this examination of
Switzerland's relations with the EC. Mr Schwok not only appears perplexed
about the lack of interest in the subject shown by the media in Community
countries, he is also clear that Switzerland's situation is different from
that of its neighbour, Austria.
Austrian membership of the EC would, he says, 'finally redeem all the
failures' of its history: loss of empire, failure of the union with Germany,
Soviet dominance following World War Two. Switzerland, he adds smugly, can
take pride in having eschewed war and fanaticism and in having turned a
country without resources into one of the world's most prosperous.
With this tone established at an early stage, one would expect that the book
would argue forcibly against the contamination that would follow from
Community membership. That the contrary is the case helps explain why Berne
is now actively in favour of membership. The book is a voyage of discovery
in which the nationalist Swiss finally has to accept that his country cannot
stand aside from the rest of Europe.
Admittedly, the conclusion is forced partly by a belief that EFTA would have
no future with Austria inside the EC. Mr Schwok clearly would not like his
country left to the mercy of a group of Nordic nations preoccupied by
irrelevancies such as cod-fishing. Mr Schwok seems scarcely to have noticed
that these countries, too, have shifted towards membership of the Community.
He perceives rightly, though, that EFTA has always had difficulty
approaching the EC as a group and that the relationship between its members
and Brussels is principally a bilateral one.
Switzerland cannot afford the marginalisation that would follow from staying
out of the EC, but in the end the middle way is not satisfactory. An attempt
to integrate Swiss law with that of the Community, ,effectively what the
European Economic Area requires, would involve a surreptitious loss of
sovereignty.
It is difficult to fault the argument, even though the book has two serious
drawbacks. The first is the wooden translation from the French. The second
is a feeling that this book has been rather long in translation. One wonders
why there is no detailed evaluation of the negotiations for the European
Economic Area, though there is some compensation in its coverage of the
Swiss/EC agreement on non-life insurance.

<TEXT>
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS THEORY AND THE UK EXPERIENCE by A P Thirlwall and
Heather Gibson Macmillan Pounds 17.50, 437 pages
IT IS time to welcome back an old favourite: does it matter if Britain has a
big current account deficit? With public sector finances ballooning into
debt and with imports likely to expand faster than exports, the next few
years will see much discussion over Britain's ability to 'pay its way' in
the world.
This book provides useful arguments as to whether we should worry about
this, or whether to treat the deficits as purely a problem for academic
economists. Thirlwall is firmly in the 'deficits do matter' camp. With his
co-author he has updated a book which first appeared in 1980 and is now in
its fourth edition. The additional material since the previous imprint in
1986 adds much to the debate about the directions for manufacturing industry
in the UK, the impact of entry into the ERM, and the degree to which
government policies can influence economic performance.
Although much of the volume is technical, the lay reader will find useful
some of the detailed discussion about economic theory. There is also a handy
table of Britain's balance of payments going back to the 19th century, as
well as an explanation of such terms as crawling exchange rates.

risks and rewards - Finance

<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR

<TEXT>
NOTHING VENTURED by Robert J Kunze HarperCollins Dollars 22.95, 252 pages
ROBERT KUNZE'S lively account of US venture capital provides a timely
counterbalance to the poor press which the industry worldwide has received
of late. Kunze provides a graphic portrait of the dilemmas which face the
venture capitalist in deciding which deals to back and the pitfalls which
can trip up even the most promising venture.
His accounts of the deals which he turned down, often after months of
investigation - his book is subtitled The Perils and Payoffs of the Great
American Venture Capital Game - make fascinating reading as well as
providing a useful guide to entrepreneurs trying to raise equity finance.
Kunze is general partner (effectively managing director) of a San Francisco
venture fund specialising in medical products and biotechnology. Before
entering venture capital he held senior management positions in industry.
Even allowing for the inevitable bias of Kunze's version of events, his
account reveals that the world of the entrepreneur is peopled with more than
its fair share of dreamers and egocentrics. Such a story could appear
self-serving but for the fact that Kunze never completely loses his sympathy
for the characters on whom his livelihood ultimately depends.
The fallibility of the venture capitalist is pointed up even by the deals
which, eventually, come right. 'Venture capitalists usually feel euphoria
after they decide to invest: it is the greatest investment ever made] This
obsession can be a fatal flaw or it can be the single reason a company
succeeds,' Kunze writes. He illustrates the wild swings between euphoria and
despair in seven profiles of companies which raised venture capital finance,
which make up the middle section.
Despite lengthy due diligence, careful market studies and the apparent
suitability of the management team, one company profiled, Agrion, failed to
break into the markets envisaged, and teetered on the brink of collapse
before a sequence of lucky coincidences brought in financially powerful new
corporate partners. Even then the company was dogged by problems, most of
which it managed to solve, before finally selling out, at a very healthy
profit to investors, to a large German pharmaceuticals company.
Nothing Ventured begins with an account of the development of venture
capital in the US from the early days in the 1950s, through the 1970s, when
successful entrepreneurs started appearing on the cover of Fortune magazine,
to the excesses of the 1980s. By this stage the volume of money pouring in
pushed up the price of deals, depressed returns and meant too many marginal
ventures received backing. This process has been mirrored, though the time
scale has been compressed into just two decades, the 1970s and the 1980s, in
the UK.
Kunze highlights the important role of the US academic community in
producing the ideas around which many venture-backed companies were built.
Establishing links between academic institutions and venture capitalists in
the UK has never taken off in quite the same way and many UK science parks
have only tenuous links with the universities and colleges on their
doorsteps.
But even in the US venture capital has only thrived in a handful of centres,
Kunze points out. Silicon Valley in California and Massachusetts' Route 128
took 20 years to become established. And while venture capital has since
spread more widely in the north-eastern US and on the west coast, there are
huge gaps on the venture capital map. Austin, Texas and Washington DC are
the only other locations where venture capital seems set to develop on any
scale in the near future.
This limited geographical dispersion of US venture capital may give some
comfort to UK venture capitalists, continually criticised for concentrating
most of their activities in London and the south east.
As well as providing advice for the entrepreneur seeking finance -
businesses must be capable of producing sales of at least Dollars 25m
(Pounds 13.8m) within six years and tripling the value of the cash invested
 -Kunze also has useful suggestions for the trainee venture capitalist.
Beware of the 'great idea,' he warns. While most business plans are based on
a great idea it will only account for 10 to 20 per cent of what it takes to
succeed. Timely execution, market acceptance and reliability are far more
crucial.
On the future of venture capital in the 1990s Kunze has some warnings for
the industry. Poorly performing funds - most of those invested after the
early 1980s - will have difficulties raising new money, so there will be
less finance available to back new companies. Investors will become more
demanding (in the UK they already have).
But on the positive side Kunze believes that large corporations will invest
more money in independent funds after the past failure of in-house funds. He
also foresees a shake-out among portfolio companies, with venture
capitalists merging several competing, loss-making businesses into one
profitable company.
The book's sub-title makes clear that Kunze's concern is the US industry but
his perfunctory treatment of the industry outside the US is disappointing.
He writes off venture capital in the UK in two paragraphs. The British, he
asserts, will not work long hours to build up a business and are too wedded
to big company perks such as cars and pension plans. He is equally
dismissive of Germany and Japan.
This narrowly home-town view of the world apart, Kunze provides an
entertaining and instructive account of one of the most exciting new
financing mechanisms to emerge in recent years.

A FULL SERVICE BANK by James Ring Adams and Douglas Frantz Simon &amp; Schuster
Pounds 16.99, 381 pages
DIRTY MONEY: THE INSIDE STORY OF THE WORLD'S SLEAZIEST BANK by Mark Potts,
Nicholas Kochan and Robert Whittington National Press Books Dollars 21.95,
274 pages
BOTH OF these books about the birth, life and eventual shut-down of the Bank
of Credit and Commerce International (BCCI) claim to offer a comprehensive
story of corruption, regulatory lassitude and international political
intrigue as they seek to unravel the tale of the world's biggest ever
financial scandal. Both, however, are essentially workmanlike products
without much in the way of revelations or even flair in story telling.
The similarities between the two books are striking. Not only do both begin
with the same scene - the atmosphere in the City of London at lunchtime on
Friday July 5, 1991, as the bank is being closed - but both even contain an
identically entitled chapter heading ('Coming to America') as they describe
the way BCCI made use of front men to acquire US banks in secret.
For the most part the two volumes, written by competent American and British
journalists, cover the same ground. Here is the early career of Agha Hasan
Abedi, the founder of BCCI. Here are the bank's roots in Abu Dhabi and the
tale of how its complicated international shareholding structure helped to
evade proper regulation. Equally chronicled are BCCI's penchant for
cultivating influential friends such as former President Jimmy Carter and
former Prime Minister James Callaghan and its tangled dealings with the
Medellin cocaine cartel, former Panamanian dictator Manuel Noriega and a
platoon of arms dealers, terrorists and other shadowy clients.
Finally, both books narrate the frustrations of US investigators from the
Congress and the Customs Service and then (justifiably) make a hero of Mr
Robert Morgenthau, the New York district attorney whose own work on the BCCI
affair sped furiously ahead of the less energetic investigations conducted
by officials in Washington or London.
Unfortunately, neither book really breaks any new ground and both have
already been overtaken somewhat by recent events. The bulk of the BCCI fraud
is already in the public domain, but the final verdict on the Bank of
England's handling of the affair, for example, must await the special report
now being prepared by Lord Bingham in the UK.
The main caveat here is that both books should be regarded as little more
than an interim report in a still unfolding saga. The decision as to which
of the two to opt for therefore depends more on how much detail is wanted. A
Full Service Bank is not only longer but a good deal more detailed, with
slightly better reporting than Dirty Money. For example, where Dirty Money
skims lightly across certain details - such as how BCCI was originally
financed by Abu Dhabi and the Bank of America - A Full Service Bank is more
thoroughly researched. Dirty Money is a quicker read, but it also depends
far more on published reporting than A Full Service Bank. The latter,
however, contains more than 100 pages of fly-on-the-wall narrative about the
adventures of US investigators in steamy settings such as Panama City and
Miami.
This reader's view, however, is that better BCCI books are still to come.
Two more books are being written at present, and are likely to be published
next winter; these books will come from journalists at The Wall Street
Journal and at Time magazine who have covered the BCCI affair and are likely
to have further revelations. If the forthcoming books are to live up to
expectations, however, they also ought to be able to make use of the added
time to pull together more of the many threads of this tantalising story.
The present offerings do not.

FINANCE AND FINANCIERS IN EUROPEAN HISTORY 1880-1960 edited by Youssef
Cassis Cambridge Pounds 40, 445 pages
IN Maupassant's novel Bel-Ami the provincial hero, George Duroy, has the
luck and cynicism required to rise from obscurity into a Parisian social
elite of dubious morals, financial and sexual. He thrives in a world where
politics is inseparable from the financial improprieties of a sophisticated
elite. But financial scandal was a feature of the Third Republic and the
belle epoque. Excesses such as the Panama affair and Maupassant's imaginary
Moroccan bond scandal were symptoms of the regime's political instability.
Hubert Bonin might have done well to include Maupassant's fictional
financier, Monsieur Walter, in his contribution to this important volume of
essays. His chapter on the political influence of bankers and financiers in
France shows the links between high finance and politics after 1850. He
shows that the banking industry benefited from a liberal environment until
the 1940s. In 1945, it was abruptly nationalised.
Alain Plessis' parallel chapter on the role of bankers in French society
examines why financiers were the target of 'recurrent and impassioned
attacks' by politicians and journalists. While there was a closed financial
elite, Plessis argues that its members were not accurately characterised by
critics who lapsed into anti-semitism and hyperbole in their attempts to
show that France was ruled by a clique of 200 families.
These examples give the book's flavour. Its central purpose is to explore
the role of finance in European history. It does this first by analysing the
position of the financial sector in six European countries through various
indicators. It then looks at the position of financial elites in society.
The volume's great merit is that it adopts a broad comparitive approach.
European finance can be understood not just in terms of economics, but also
in terms of political and social forces and in the context of international
affairs.
A starting point is the notion that, in spite of the recent collapse of
rival modes of production and distribution, modern capitalism, and
particularly its origins, is still rather poorly understood. Indeed,
academic study of the role played by capitalists and financiers has advanced
little since 1967, when Professor Rondo Cameron published his pioneering
work on Banking in the early stages of industrialisation. Cameron argued
that bankers and financial intermediaries had played a greater role in the
industrial revolution than history had previously allowed.
Sidney Pollard and Dieter Ziegler usefully assess recent historical work
which has raised important reservations about some of Cameron's applications
of his ideas, notably his thesis that Scotland's more sophisticated
financial structure kept the country's economic growth rate above that of
England.
The broad issue of banks and economic development is well treated in a
series of chapters and Harold James offers a useful summary of the
contributions. He concludes that the years between the 1880s and 1930s were
a golden era for commercial banks. By contrast, in the 1930s there was a
secular shift associated with the world depression. In the UK, the influence
of commercial banks declined as building societies and savings banks took a
greater share of deposits. In the rest of Europe, there were banking crises
after which the savings banks grew faster than their commercial
counterparts.

MARKETS, FIRMS, AND THE MANAGEMENT OF LABOUR IN MODERN BRITAIN by Howard
Gospel Cambridge Pounds 30, 256 pages
THERE IS a widely-held view that the Thatcher governments, by reducing the
power of trade unions, removed an important source of industrial
inefficiency and paved the way for a new approach to labour relations,
better suited to the needs of international competition. Like many judgments
about the 1980s, this is at best an over-simplification. One of the merits
of Howard Gospel's admirably clear and well-argued account of the management
of labour in Britain is that it places recent developments in industrial
relations in a historical perspective. He argues that both the malign
influence of trade unions in the pre-Thatcher period and the extent of the
changes in the 1980s have been much exaggerated.
Two central themes in the book are, first, that the character of labour
relations is shaped largely by employers and, second, that employers respond
rationally to the market conditions which face them. British employers in
the 19th century adopted a labour relations strategy which fitted the needs
of the time - relying on the external market for labour, recruiting and
laying off as demand changed, avoiding long-term commitments to employees.
The institutions and attitudes arising from this strategy were reinforced
during the inter-war period. Faced with fluctuating product markets and an
abundant supply of workers, employers saw labour 'as a commodity to be
purchased at the going rate in the market place, with only minimal rights
and benefits within the workplace'. The apprenticeship system, for example,
was regarded by most employers more as a source of cheap labour than as a
way of providing the skilled human resources of the future.
Gospel contrasts this 'externalising' approach to the management of labour
with the 'internalising' strategy. The latter involves systematically
screening, recruiting and training workers and making every effort to
convert them into permanent employees. Some large companies in
capital-intensive industries did pursue such a strategy in the 19th and
early 20th centuries, but they were exceptions. Most companies were too
small to afford the necessary investment in managerial hierarchies; when
they did come together in mergers, they were generally run as loose holding
companies.
In the inter-war period larger companies in the US and Germany modernised
their industrial relations by developing internal labour markets. Britain's
lag was not a serious disadvantage in the protected and cartelised markets
of the 1930s. But after World War Two circumstances changed in two important
respects.
First, a prolonged period of full employment greatly strengthened the trade
unions and put collective bargaining arrangements under strain. Second,
competition in product markets began to increase from the 1960s as
price-fixing agreements were abandoned and import penetration rose.
Yet the response of British employers was slow. There was no concerted
attempt to remove inefficiencies in the workplace, reflecting management
acquiescence in over-manning and restrictive practices. Employers lacked the
organisational capacity at both national and company level to confront the
unions. Moreover, the will to launch such an attack was weakened by strong
demand, sheltered markets and a political climate of consensus.
As these easy conditions faded, it became clear that industrial relations
constituted a serious competitive problem for British industry. A growing
number of firms saw the disadvantages of employer associations which did
little to regulate conflict in the workplace. The trend towards more formal
single-employer bargaining was led by large companies in chemicals, oil
refining and parts of engineering; foreign multinationals played a
significant role. Such firms had both the motivation and the capability to
establish and administer internal labour systems.
Gospel rightly stresses that the reform of industrial relations started in
the mid-1960s. More controversially, he thinks that in the 1980s British
employers have built on the developments of the previous two decades; he
sees the changes as incremental rather than discontinuous.
This judgment would be challenged by many business people, for whom the
1980s marked a decisive change in labour-management relations. Gospel
accepts that a reduction in union power contributed to productivity growth
in the 1980s. But he argues that, in general, outside industries such as
coal mining in the first half of the 20th century and motor vehicles after
World War Two, the effect of unions on efficiency has been uneven and
probably exaggerated. 'Employers had initiatory power, while union power was
largely reactive and negative'.
Even if Gospel may under-estimate the independent influence of trade unions
in the earlier post-war period, no one would deny that employers today are
firmly in the driving seat. Under the pressure of competition, the
institutional inertia which held back the modernisation of British
industrial relations has been largely dissipated. Employers now have to take
the process further by developing more positive industrial relations
policies and investing in the skills, capabilities and commitment of their
workforce.

BILL GATES AND THE MAKING OF THE MICROSOFT EMPIRE by James Wallace and Jim
Erickson John Wiley, Dollars 22.95, 426 pages
WHEN THE screens and keyboards which clutter office desks are finally
replaced by proper visicom robots, men will marvel that such crude and
cumbersome machines could have ordered the business affairs of the late 20th
century.
Yet the revolution which produced today's personal computers was itself a
marvel of ingenuity and persistence. And among the heroes of that epic none
is odder, nor more spectacularly successful, than Bill Gates, the schoolboy
programmer, who became the billionaire chairman of Microsoft.
From his schooldays Gates was fascinated by the programming which makes
inanimate machines jump into life. In the early years this was a dreadfully
slow and painful task, both for the programmer and for the user: the machine
communicated in sullen and pedantic monosyllables.
Gates's and Microsoft's most recent success is founded on the vision that
personal computers should be bright, alive and responsive to the user,
should communicate in a simple standard way and should anticipate the user's
needs wherever possible. These ideas were first embodied in the operating
system of Apple computers, which present the user with a screen of small
drawings (or 'ikons') representing tasks he might want it to perform. By
using a remote controlled pointer, or 'mouse', the user can give
instructions without any need for typing.
Microsoft developed its rival Windows system for use on International
Business Machines personal computers and compatible makes. After a hesitant
start, Microsoft Windows is now sweeping the computing world, consolidating
Microsoft's dominance of the software industry and Gates's position as the
richest man in America, with a net worth of more than Dollars 8bn (Pounds
4.3bn).
Windows will no doubt come to be seen as an early form in the evolution of
intelligent desk-top machines to a point when they can understand the human
voice, can make suggestions and carry out many routine tasks unasked. Anyone
who thinks such ideas seem far fetched should read Wallace and Erickson's
account of the extraordinary progress made during the 36 years of Gates's
life and love for the soul of the machine.
It started when Gates was a bright, curious and highly competitive schoolboy
at Lakeside school, Seattle, playing games on a cumbersome terminal
connected to a computer owned by a local company called Computer Center
Corporation. Before long the 13-year-old Gates and his fellow pupils were
exploiting so many loopholes and faults in the machine that they were
invited by the company to go in after school to test the operating system to
destruction - while keeping a careful log. Gates then developed his lifelong
habit of working far into the night, but he did well in school also.
Gates even founded his first company, Traf-O-Data, at Lakeside, offering
analysis of urban traffic flows to local authorities. It might have
prospered, had not the Federal Government undercut him.
It was at Harvard, however, that Gates made his first serious business
venture with a fellow computer enthusiast, Paul Allen. They read that a
small company in New Mexico was to produce the first hobby computer in kit
form, the 'Altair', for the then amazingly low price of Dollars 397. No
matter that it lacked keyboard, screen, adequate memory, or programmes to
make it work, hobbyists were queueing to buy. Gates and Allen worked
feverishly at the Harvard computer to produce a version of the BASIC
programming language that would run on a machine of such meagre capacity. It
was a formidable task, since the computer understands only the simplest
instructions to open or shut switches. Gates and Allen completed the job,
formed a company called Microsoft and struck a deal with the maker of the
Altair.
In those early years, Gates displayed all the qualities of obsessive hard
work, vision, salesmanship, arrogance and temper tantrums which were so
important in 1980 when International Business Machines asked Microsoft to
develop a BASIC for the personal computer it was planning. Microsoft was
also to develop an operating system for the first IBM PC. This is the
central nervous system of a computer which silently organises the memory,
disk storage, and other 'bodily functions'. Devising an operating system is
a huge task which depends on excruciating detail, a combination suited to
Gates's genius. Even so, his new Disk Operating System was derivative, and
Gates struck a very tough bargain with Seattle Computer for the rights to
MS-DOS, the system which was eventually used on millions of machines
throughout the world.
This was an epic success, which broke some men and came close to destroying
the company, but it led to greater things, the development of Windows, and
Microsoft's leading wordprocessing and spreadsheet packages, Word and Excel.
Wallace and Erickson have made this into an exciting tale, told in the racy
style of American business journalism, with plenty of detail and well
researched quotations, all focused on the enigmatic personality of Bill
Gates. He emerges as a mildly unpleasant night owl with few interests
besides writing and selling computer algorithms. He relaxes by breaking the
speed limit, but cannot, it seems, fit women into his busy schedule nor find
time for many of the usual forms of relaxation. He screams abuse at his
employees and forces them to work inhuman hours. Yet work they do, at a
frenzied pace, and many are now millionaires through stock options.
By the end of the book one cannot help liking this appallingly ambitious and
lonesome brat. And if one should ask: 'What shall it profit a man that he
should gain the whole world . . . ?', the answer is that Gates's Dollars 8bn
represents, not just his winnings, but an important contribution to one of
the great revolutions in human history.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: Focus on jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Although the markets reacted pessimistically to Friday's non-farm payroll
data for May, traders will probably discuss the finer details of the
indicator this week, writes James Blitz.
There are plenty of other US statistics for the market to chew on in the
week, including May's producer prices figures due out on Thursday and the
same month's consumer prices figures due to be released at the end of the
week. But last Friday's non-farm payroll report had been seen as a vital
indicator of the strength of the US recovery, and will still need digesting
by dollar investors.
Analysts said that there was renewed pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease
interest rates and boost recovery after the non-farm payroll report showed
that US unemployment had surged to 7.5 per cent in May from 7.2 per cent in
April. The dollar responded by falling over a pfennig against the D-Mark to
DM1.5880.
But Michael Feeney, of Sumitomo Bank, believes that the upward revision for
the April payroll to 182,000 from 126,000 makes the overall picture
brighter, and expects the markets to respond to this more fully. 'If you
average out the revisions it all washes out,' he says. 'The Fed needs more
than weak money supply figures for an ease, but these jobless figures are
not weak enough for that.'
Trading in European Monetary System currencies is also certain to dominate
attention, after Denmark's decision not to participate in European Monetary
Union caused a flight into D-Marks. The German currency's rise appeared to
be firmly based by the weekend. The UK's retail prices index due out on
Friday, which is expected to show a second consecutive monthly rise, could
shake sterling further.

FT  08 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Banks back to the future
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
All recent history suggests that acquisitive financial institutions with
grandiose global aspirations have a marked tendency to come unstuck. The US
commercial banks' plunge into the British securities market in the
mid-1980s; Barclays' and National Westminster's recent adventures in North
America; Fuji Bank's disastrous acquisition of Chicago-based Walter E.
Heller; and, dare one say it, Midland Bank's catastrophic acquisition of
Crocker in California and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's
unhappy experience with Marine Midland.
With Lloyds finally retreating from the battle for Midland without any
damage to its share price on Friday, shareholders in Hongkong and Shanghai
must resign themselves to a gigantic leap backwards into the future. One can
understand why the men from Hong Kong want to do it. But it is also clear,
to judge by the market's response, that the shareholders have as much
enthusiasm for their management's international plans as the Danes have for
Maastricht. The difference is that bankers are subject to much looser
accountability than politicians. But for how much longer?
One explanation for the extraordinary ability of bankers to lose billions
over the past decade is that while the liabilities side of their balance
sheet has been socialised through deposit insurance, the asset side has been
subjected to increased competition. The bankers are thus under pressure to
generate increased profits - which implies taking on increased risk -
without being subject to any discipline from depositors.
The result is that they find themselves down at Canary Wharf, London's
answer to Brasilia, lending billions of unsecured money with no better
guarantee than the support of a parent company balance sheet that the
Reichmann brothers thought indelicate to show them. The taxpayer ends up
footing a substantial bill.
The extreme example is the US after the savings and loan debacle. Yet the US
banking system is now pointing to some thought-provoking ways out of the
impasse.
If bank stocks have lifted themselves off the floor this year, it is partly
because Wall Street has detected that rewards in banking are now being
subsidised, as well as risks. That is, the proportion of the asset side of
the balance sheet that carries an explicit or implicit government guarantee
has been growing as the banks buy Treasury bills, guaranteed mortgage backed
securities and the rest.
This risk-averse behaviour is just about profitable thanks to a steepening
yield curve, as the Fed drives down short-term interest rates while bond
rates remain relatively high. Since short-term rates have not come down in
Europe, a flatter yield curve precludes a comparable response. Yet the idea
of socialising both sides of the balance sheet as a means of clipping the
bankers' wings has its appeal. Why not unbundle the banks to achieve a
better matching of risk in the different parts of their business?
The moral hazard implicit in deposit insurance could be minimised if the
regulators insisted that insurance was only available where deposits were
invested in designated low-risk assets. Insurance might also be continued
for the payments system, which is really a utility. Risky assets, meantime,
could be financed chiefly by uninsured wholesale deposits, which would
carefully sort out the banking sheep from the goats.
All that flies in the face of the mega-merger cult. Nor, incidentally, would
it have been impossible to socialise assets in a Lloyds-Midland merger in
order to square competition policy. The US Community Reinvestment Act can
make bank mergers conditional on the expansion of lending to minorities and
the poor. Nationsbank (the newly combined NCNB and C&amp;S/Sovran), for example,
is required to expand such lending by Dollars 10bn over the next decade.
The commercial equivalent of an ethnic minority in Britain is the small
business sector. It would not be hard to stipulate a specific increase in
small business lending, as a condition of a merger, to pre-empt excessive
concentration. British banks, like their US counterparts, would hate it. But
would such a policy cost the banks more than Latin America or Canary Wharf?

SOUTH AFRICA'S Standard Bank Investment Corp (Stanbic) said its wholly-owned
subsidiary Standard Bank London had been authorised by the Bank of England
to begin banking in Britain, Reuters reports from Johannesburg.
A statement said it was the first British banking licence issued to a South
African bank since the imposition in 1985 of an international moratorium on
South African debt repayments.
Standard Bank London would perform the financial services of Stanbic's
current UK representative office and its existing London subsidiary,
Standard London.
The new subsidiary would play a central role in Stanbic's international
network and facilitate trade and capital flows between southern Africa and
the rest of the world.
Standard London currently deals with trade and loan finance, is a
market-maker in South African equities and all rand-related currency and
treasury products and takes part in the market in East European, African and
South American debt.
Stanbic described the launch of Standard Bank London as part of a strategy
to support customers' global business.

committees

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN ONTARIO court has split Olympia &amp; York's creditors into six committees
for the purpose of negotiating a debt-restructuring plan for the crippled
property developer.
O&amp;Y had proposed five committees, but Mr Justice Blair ruled that holders of
securities fully backed by specific buildings should be segregated from a
group of five banks which have lesser claims to the properties.
Creditors affected by the order have claims on Olympia &amp; York Developments,
the Reichmann family's parent company, and on 28 other Canadian companies
now under court protection.
Their loans make up about two-thirds of O&amp;Y's total CDollars 13.5bn
(USDollars 11.3bn) debt, and do not include direct loans to the Canary Wharf
project in London or O&amp;Y's two dozen US office buildings.
The committees represent the following groups:
About 30 members of a USDollars 2.5bn jumbo loan syndicate. By far the
biggest lender in this group is Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corp, which
advanced Dollars 750m.
Seven banks, led by Citicorp, which provided a Dollars 500m loan secured by
O&amp;Y's stake in Carena Corp, a Canadian property holding company controlled
by Toronto's Bronfman brothers.
Banks and insurance companies which hold Dollars 1.6bn in unsecured loans,
swaps and guarantees.
Holders of marketable securities, including various issues of bonds,
debentures and commercial paper.
Lenders to specific projects with a prior claim on those assets. They
include holders of CDollars 475m of bonds secured by First Canadian Place,
O&amp;Y's 72-storey flagship building in Toronto.
Four Canadian banks plus Citibank Canada which have subordinated claims to
various buildings.
Several of the creditors, notably the Canadian banks and Citicorp, are
represented on more than one committee.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Farm reforms may bring a bitter harvest: Europe's
agrochemical groups face restructuring
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With annual turnover of more than Dollars 8bn (Pounds 4.3bn), European agro
chemicals are big business. But, since last month's agreement on farm policy
reform, the world's largest market for products from fertilisers to
fungicides, is also in big trouble.
Market growth was minimal even before the agreement. Return on investment is
poor, and the financial risks of research and development high.
Now the reforms, which involve setting aside 15 per cent of agricultural
land from production and a 29 per cent reduction in cereal prices, threaten
to unleash a fundamental restructuring of the sector.
Ciba-Geigy, the Swiss group and the world's largest agrochemical
manufacturer, estimates sales will fall between 5 per cent and 10 per cent
within five years. France's largest chemical group, Rhone-Poulenc, expects a
drop of 5 per cent, while Imperial Chemical Industries of the UK sees a 15
per cent fall within three years.
The difficulty facing forecasters is that details of the reforms have not
been decided. 'A lot depends on how the 15 per cent of land is set aside,'
says Mr Allan Woodburn, director of Allan Woodburn Associates, an
agrochemicals market-research company.
'If the set-aside land is rotated, farmers will need to use herbicides on
it. If it's set aside for good, the consequences for the industry are more
serious,' he says.
The position is complicated by expectations that the reforms will lead to a
sharp fall in the number of farmers throughout Europe. This, paradoxically,
could mitigate the effects on the agrochemicals market.
Mr Walter Ernst, head of Bayer's agrochemicals division, says only 80,000 of
Germany's 400,000 farmers will be in business by the year 2002.
Rhone-Poulenc says the number of French farmers will halve within a decade.
Mr Alain Godard, director general of agrochemicals at Rhone-Poulenc, says
efficient farmers could be tempted to increase yields by using more product
on the 85 per cent of the land they are still able to farm.
However, ICI challenges this view. It fears more farmers, hit by falling
prices, will be tempted to use non-patented and cheap generic products.
Dr Alan Norris, a director specialising in chemicals mergers and
acquisitions at Chase Investment Bank in London, says groups like Schering
of Germany and Atochem of France - whose proportion of sales in Europe are,
respectively, 63 per cent and 62 per cent - have most to lose from the
changes. ICI, in comparison, has a broader base. Its European sales
represent only 31 per cent of turnover.
As volumes decline, a further threat to revenues is that prices might fall.
Ciba-Geigy, for example, is intent on winning market share in the UK and
recognises prices could fall. So far, pricing has been kept disciplined but
whether that can continue is open to question.
The agrochemicals groups nevertheless have to maintain large cost bases to
stay in business.
Research and development, the life-blood of the industry, is expensive and
becoming more so. Farmers demand environment-friendly chemicals to treat
their crops. Insects and fungi build up resistance to existing products. For
the chemicals groups, R&amp;D produces new, patentable products, for which they
can charge a premium.
Bayer estimates its agrochemicals division, with annual turnover of DM3.2bn
(Pounds 1.09bn), spends DM400m a year on R&amp;D, or 12.5 per cent of turnover.
Rhone-Poulenc and ICI both spend the equivalent of 8 per cent of turnover.
ICI says it costs between Dollars 80m and Dollars 100m and between 10 and 12
years to put new chemicals through the necessary regulatory hurdles.
Additional costs have been added by re-registration of old products to
ensure they meet new higher regulations.
ICI estimates it has spent Dollars 100m during the past four years to bring
14 of its 30 products up to new US standards. The EC is introducing similar
regulations. The company believes some groups with less commitment will
conclude that such expenditure is not justifiable.
A shakeout is inevitable. With 30 significant competitors, there will only
be 10 research-based groups left by the end of the decade, warns Mr Ernst at
Bayer.
Most restructuring will involve joint ventures, at least for the largest
groups, believes Dr Norris at Chase. The multiples required to buy a
research-based agrochemicals company are too high for an outright purchase.
He argues the savings through merging would generate significantly higher
margins.
Some companies would like to exit, at the right price. The commitment to
agrochemicals of groups like Germany's BASF, Shell, the Anglo-Dutch group,
and FMC, and Rohm and Haas, of the US, is debatable.
Restructuring has already begun. Schering tried but failed to put together a
venture with Sandoz. Two Japanese groups, Sumitomo Chemical and Ishihara,
have been buying small research and distribution groups. A few groups are
looking at the possibility of building up niches, either geographical or in
particular product areas, says Dr Norris.
Mr Godard is optimistic. He says demographic changes mean increased demand
for food and that oil-bearing crops could be used as alternatives to
fossil-fuels. However, Dr Norris at Chase says the countries with most need
for increased food production are those with least money to pay for
high-margin agrochemicals.
Even if the industry does have the potential to make sustainable profits, it
will first have to be significantly weeded.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Japanese accuse US and EC of widespread trade violations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN has accused the US and European Community of widespread trade
violations and of arbitrarily applying anti-dumping measures against
Japanese goods.
The attack comes in Japan's first annual review of unfair trade drawn up by
a senior advisory body to the Ministry of International Trade and Industry.
It accuses the US of the most abuses, at the same time as Japan's current
account surplus is soaring to record levels.
The report is a sign of Japan's determination to take a more prominent role
in the trade debate and is similar to annual assessments of trade barriers
by the US Trade Representative's office and the European Commission. Unlike
the US review, the Japanese report will not be a starting point for punitive
action against other countries.
'We hope that the report will stimulate discussion,' a trade and industry
official said. 'We admit that we are deficient in some areas, but we thought
it would be useful to define 'unfair trade' and look at the practices of our
trading partners.'
The study divided trade policies into 10 categories. It found that the US
was deficient in nine of these and the EC in six. Indonesia, Thailand and
Malaysia had a relatively good score, with black marks in only four
categories. The study excluded China, which would have a long list of
violations, because that country is not a member of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade.
Among US deficiencies was the demand for voluntary export restraints for
products including steel, machine tools, textiles and cars, all of which
affected Japanese companies and which were defined as a 'violation of
explicit Gatt provisions'.
The EC was listed for having imposed 'discriminatory quantitative
restrictions' on imports of 49 Japanese-made items. Italy was cited for
restricting direct imports of Japanese cars to 3,600 units, and only
allowing the import of another 27,000 vehicles through third countries.
In assessing 'unfair practices', the advisory body, including professors
from leading Japanese universities and representatives from companies such
as Nissan Motor and Sony Corporation, generally relied on interpretations of
Gatt provisions and international law.
It found that the US 'ignores commercial reality in favour of arbitrary,
mechanical rules' in bringing anti-dumping cases, while anti-dumping
measures were also allowed 'to apply to products that have not been subject
to an investigation.
'The EC follows many of the same practices as the US, and thus misuses the
Gatt and the anti-dumping code in the same way. In addition, the EC has some
uniquely European practices that exaggerate the proper scope of anti-dumping
law.'
Both the US and the EC were condemned for establishing arbitrary rules in
assessing the origin of products, a sensitive matter for Japanese companies
which have established foreign production facilities. The US 'frequently
abuses' conventions on this matter, and 'draft rules emerging from the
negotiations of a North American Free Trade Agreement indicate the strong
possibility that Nafta will impose origin rules that represent serious
restrictions on the traditional origin determinations'.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Serb forces prepare for final attack on Sarajevo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
SERB militia forces yesterday were preparing to launch a sustained and final
offensive against the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo as United Nations
officials tried to put the final touches to an agreement aimed at re-opening
the airport.
Large parts of the city were in flames after a weekend-long artillery and
mortar attack by Serb militia forces and the rump Yugoslav army. Thirty
people, many of them civilians, were reported killed. The airport, like
Sarajevo, has been blockaded for the past nine weeks.
Mr Cedric Thornberry, the UN's special envoy to Sarajevo, said that without
agreement on lifting the blockade, the people of Sarajevo would soon die of
starvation. They have been without supplies of food, water, electricity and
medicine for more than two months.
It will take a few days for the UN to finalise the negotiations, which
entail the deployment of 1,000 UN troops along a 10km ring around the
airport. But the talks could collapse, as have many ceasefires and
agreements.
Mr Thornberry, however, insisted the UN would keep trying. 'We must press
on. We must reach agreement,' he said.
Mr Mirsad Beserovic, a journalist at Radio Sarajevo, said: 'The Serb
irregulars know time is running out for them. This is no longer a war of
conquest by Serbia over Sarajevo. It is a war of destruction. It is pure
evil.'
Serb militia and irregulars continue to blast everything in sight. They
tried to bomb the local reservoir, the government headquarters, and every
administrative building in the city.
George Graham in Washington writes: President George Bush and Mr John Major
said they had no plans to move beyond the current UN economic sanctions
against Serbia and Montenegro. 'We stick with the sanctions, and we make
them tough,' Mr Major said after meeting Mr Bush at the president's Camp
David retreat.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Czechs and Slovaks reconsider the federation: Following
weekend elections, the two peoples may be heading for a 'velvet divorce'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON and ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The fate of Czechoslovakia now rests with two powerful politicians after
weekend elections revealed the strength of left-wing separatist feelings in
Slovakia and strong support for western-style economic reforms in the Czech
lands.
Voters in the economically more advanced and populous Czech republic, with
its capital in Prague, strongly supported the Civic Democratic party (ODS)
led by Mr Vaclav Klaus, the federal finance minister. But Slovaks in the
economically fragile eastern part of the federal state voted overwhelmingly
for Mr Vladimir Meciar, leader of the Movement for a Democratic Slovakia. Mr
Meciar has promised that Slovakia will no longer be dictated to by Prague
but until now has stopped short of demanding outright independence.
The two men, who will dominate their respective republican parliaments, will
have to make difficult compromises at a federal level which will test their
political skills to the utmost if the Czech and Slovak federation is to
survive.
In the Czech republic, the results are a personal triumph for Mr Klaus, and
a blow to the pollsters who predicted the ODS would only pick up about 20
per cent of the vote. It got more than 30 per cent.
The polls failed to register how Mr Klaus managed to win the pocket-book
loyalty of millions of voters by implementing the first stage of mass
privatisation before the election.
More than 8.5m voters went into these elections as the owners of voucher
books entitling them to shares in thousands of Czech and Slovak companies
now being privatised. Mr Klaus has made sure that millions of Czechs and
Slovaks have a stake in the successful outcome of economic reform.
At a first glance, the election results indicate that this has mainly
affected voters in the Czech lands. Many Slovak voters responded instead to
Mr Meciar's argument that an arrogant Prague had imposed macro-economic
policies which failed to reflect the different needs of Slovakia's weaker
and more vulnerable economy, still heavily based on arms and heavy industry.
But finding common ground on constitutional issues will be as difficult as
bridging the wide economic differences. Over the last two years, Czech and
Slovak politicians have tried and failed to write a new constitution to
replace that inherited from the communist regime which was swept away by the
November 1989 'velvet revolution'.
The question is whether Mr Klaus and Mr Meciar, having emerged as clear
leaders in their respective republics, have the political and personal
skills to negotiate a new basis for co-existence.
At present, legislation in the tri-cameral federal assembly has to be
approved both by the mixed Chamber of Peoples and the Chamber of Nations,
where Czechs and Slovaks have equal weight and vote separately. This allows
a handful of Slovaks to veto constitutional or legislative changes.
The first indication of a willingness to compromise will come early next
month with a presidential election by the new parliament. The Civic Forum
coalition, which backed the incumbent, Mr Vaclav Havel, split 15 months ago
and is now dead. Mr Havel, a Czech, will need Mr Meciar's Slovak votes to be
re-elected.
Mr Klaus, whose ODS was the only party to fight the election in both
republics, apart from the neo-fascist republican party of Mr Miroslav
Sladek, rejects any idea of a looser confederation and insists that a future
reformed federation must rest on a common currency, a single central bank,
close co-operation in fiscal and monetary policy and commitment to market
reforms.
This would leave the federal government with crucial economic powers against
the wishes of Mr Meciar, who wants economic decisions to be made in
Bratislava, the Slovak capital. Mr Meciar calls for greater state
intervention, financed by budget deficits if necessary and a Slovak central
bank.
This is anathema to Mr Klaus, who campaigned on the principle that the
federation is only worth preserving if it is based on 'sound principles'. If
not, he says, it would be better to opt for a 'velvet divorce'.
One of the few areas of common ground is the belief that dissolution of the
federal republic would not lead to the ethnic violence which has
characterised the partition of former Yugoslavia.
The elections, in which over 80 per cent of the electorate voted, were
impeccably peaceful. Together the Czechs and Slovaks ran the most successful
democracy in central Europe between the wars. But Slovaks have long resented
Prague's dominant role which has fueled the desire for Slovak national
sovereignty.
If these resentments lead to political divorce, however, it would inevitably
distract attention from economic reform. It would also cost the Slovak
budget an estimated Dollars 500m in annual subsidies from the Czech lands
and lead to a projected 100 per cent devaluation of the new Slovak currency.
After several recent devaluations, the federal currency, the koruna, is
stable at about 29-30 to the US dollar.
By contrast, the Czech lands, released from the burden of subsidising
Slovakia, and benefiting from proximity to the German and other EC markets,
would probably become even more attractive to foreigners. Investment bankers
in Prague say mainly US and EC companies have projects worth up to Dollars
5bn in the pipeline. Several dozen projects are only awaiting Czech
government approval before they can start. The attractiveness of investment
has been reinforced by the strong vote for rapid privatisation and market
reforms.
Slovakia has received some recent foreign investment, like Volkswagen's new
assembly plant in Bratislava and a joint venture with Whirlpool, the US
domestic appliance group. But over 80 per cent of foreign investment so far
has been in the Czech lands. Secession and a lesser commitment to economic
reform would further reduce Slovakia's attractiveness to foreign investors
who are desperately needed to help restructure the economy.
Apart from the strong economic arguments for remaining attached to what is
likely to be an increasingly powerful Czech economic 'locomotive', Slovakia
has a 600,000 strong ethnic Hungarian minority, an unresolved conflict with
Hungary over the controversial Gabcikovo dam project on the Danube and a
disputed border with a resurgent independent Ukraine. This is a potentially
dangerous part of the world for a small country on its own.
But Czechs too would be diminished if Slovakia peeled away, leaving them
alone to face the unresolved issue of compensation for the 3m ethnic Germans
expelled after the last war. Heavy German investment has already stirred the
first worries about the long-term risks to the survival of Czech culture as
a small country of only 10m people.
These are powerful, common sense reasons for Czechs and Slovaks to
re-negotiate the basis of their continuing co-existence.
Before the election, president Havel told voters they had the power 'to make
Czechoslovakia a focus of European stability or a place of permanent
conflict . . . and permanent political and constitutional crisis'. The
voters have spoken. It is now up to their elected leaders to decide which
path the country chooses.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Letter: Institute plans to act on Cadbury corporate
governance report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr W I D PLAISTOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, A number of the Cadbury report's recommendations on corporate
governance require action by the accountancy profession. These are now being
addressed urgently by my institute.
Internal controls: The institute made several submissions to the Cadbury
Committee, one of which recommended that listed companies should report
publicly on the state of their internal controls. The institute, with the
100 Group of Finance Directors, and the Institute of Chartered Accountants
of Scotland, has set up a working group to examine the practicalities of
reporting on internal control from the business viewpoint, and to take
forward Cadbury's recommendations.
Going concern: A similar working group will look at guidance for company
directors on the Cadbury recommendation that they should state in their
report that the business is a going concern. This work will be complementary
to that relevant to the proposals of the Auditing Practices Board on this
subject.
Rotation of audit partners: The institute also plans to carry out work on
the Cadbury Committee's proposal that the profession should draw up
appropriate guidelines for periodic changes of audit partners. Careful
consideration will be given to the implications of this, with a view to the
possible production of ethical guidance by the three institutes of chartered
accountants.
Prelims and Interims: The auditing committee of the institute recently
issued a discussion paper on the need for preliminary announcements of
listed companies' annual results to have audit approval. It is also
considering the role of the auditor in relation to interim statements and
will take account of the Cadbury Committee's recommendations on the subject.
Research: The institute has earmarked funds for any research proposals which
would carry forward the Cadbury Committee's work.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Solidarity meets social change: Union membership is falling
and the labour movement may be losing its 'critical mass'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Continental Europe has been experiencing a hot spring of labour unrest.
Workers in Germany, the Netherlands, Spain, France and Italy have been
taking industrial action over the past few weeks from varying positions of
strength and weakness.
If there has been any common factor linking the disputes it has been a
reaction to governments or employers trying to squeeze inflationary
expectations as European monetary discipline bites.
Government and employers in the UK have been trying to do the same. Yet
absent from the strike list are British workers, once famed for their
militancy, and still among the most highly unionised in Europe. This is no
fluke; in 1991 the number of days lost through strikes in the UK was the
lowest since records began 100 years ago.
The absence of strikes says something about how UK industrial relations have
changed, although it is not necessarily a sign of the terminal weakness of
organised labour. In Scandinavia, where unions are strong, strikes are rare.
In countries like the US and France, where unions overall are weak, they are
common in certain sectors.
Indeed, the reforms introduced by Britain's Conservative government in the
1980s, curbing the use of the strike weapon and making unions more
accountable to their members, not only improved industrial relations but
also, arguably, strengthened the support for apolitical trade unionism.
Contrary to much of the union rhetoric of the time there was no 'attack' on
trade unionism in the 1980s in the sense - well understood by American trade
unionists - of widespread derecognition of unions and refusal by employers
to continue collective bargaining.
Yet, after the failure of the Labour party to win the general election,
could the 1990s be the decade in which the unions start to lose that
critical mass which still makes them a force to be reckoned with in British
industrial life?
At the very least, they will face another five years of unfriendly
government, falling membership as jobs continue to shift from manufacturing
to thinly unionised services, and employers able to set the bargaining
agenda.
Some union leaders claim to detect a more conciliatory spirit in the new
Tory government - undogmatic Mrs Gillian Shephard at the Employment
Department and interventionist Mr Michael Heseltine at Industry - but they
may be confusing style with substance.
The leaders of the Trade Union Congress meet Mrs Shephard tomorrow and will
have a chance to find out. She has inherited an employment white paper more
openly opposed to collective bargaining and traditional trade unionism, and
more enthusiastic about re-establishing a direct relationship between
employer and employee, than any of the white papers from the Thatcher years.
She has also inherited legislative plans that could radically speed up the
decline in union membership. According to Professor Paul Willman of the
London Business School, the government plan to end the system by which
employers deduct union dues from employee pay packets could cut union
membership by up to 15 per cent, when it is introduced next year, so making
worse the financial crisis many unions face.
Furthermore, the government's plans to decentralise large parts of the
public services and introduce private sector management practices and local
pay bargaining could undermine the heartland of trade unionism. According to
the 1991 British Social Attitudes survey, 69 per cent of public sector
workers are in a union, compared with 27 per cent in the private sector.
The trend in the private sector is one of inexorable decline. Professor
David Metcalf of the London School of Economics says: 'By the end of the
decade, union membership will be below 20 per cent because of the growth in
services at the expense of manufacturing.'
Even in manufacturing industry, union density - the proportion of union
members in the total workforce - is down to about 40 per cent thanks to
union failure to recruit in growth sectors like electronics.
Yet the bleakness of the outlook for the unions should not be exaggerated.
There is no evidence that UK industrial relations is following the US
pattern, where unionisation has fallen from nearly 40 per cent of employees
in the 1940s to about 12 per cent today.
Even in UK service industries, supposedly a no-go area for unionism, there
are exceptions to the rule. Take the high street of a typical town in
south-east England: Midland Bank, Barclays Bank, the post office, the
railway station, W H Smith, and J Sainsbury are organisations that recognise
unions and bargain with them centrally.
The unions have lost 3.5m members since 1979, but they still have just fewer
than 10m members, including non-TUC affiliated unions. That is a respectable
38 per cent of all employees, excluding the self-employed.
Collective bargaining still covers more than half of all UK employees and
has an influence far beyond its formal boundaries with many non-union
employers shadowing union agreements. Decentralisation of bargaining in the
private sector, and the winding up of national agreements, has often played
to union strength at plant level.
Derecognition is slowly picking up but has been relatively rare over the
past decade apart from a few spectacular cases like Mr Rupert Murdoch's
shedding of the print unions at his Wapping plant and a trickle of less
prominent ones involving professional and managerial staff.
One reason deregulation has not gathered pace is the flexibility of the
unions - represented nationally by figures such as Mr John Edmonds leader of
the GMB general union and Mr Bill Jordan leader of the AEEU craft union.
Such unions have accepted much of the new 'human resources management'
personnel agenda with its emphasis on labour as a resource, not just a cost,
which needs to be trained, developed and communicated with - often
by-passing union channels.
And so rare has been the opportunity to acquire new members that unions have
competed to offer single union, no-strike deals, with complete labour force
flexibility on greenfield sites. Many established sites have started to win
similar changes, for example, the recent Japanese-style working practices
deal at Rover cars.
This new flexibility, which the unions have been forced to accept, has
helped to wipe out the historic productivity gap between union and non-union
companies and thus removed an important incentive to de-unionise.
Despite relative union weakness, and high unemployment, union negotiators
have comfortably protected their employed members' pockets since 1979. When
comparing similar jobs, union membership still benefits employees. The union
mark-up has fallen slightly in the past few years, but is still a 5 per cent
improvement on the pay of comparable workers not covered by collective
bargaining.
Pay rises are increasingly exchanged for productivity gains but,
nevertheless, unit labour cost increases over the past few years have
generally been markedly ahead of the UK's main competitors and average
earnings increases - currently 7.75 per cent on an annualised basis - have
remained at least two percentage points ahead of inflation.
This continuing pay problem prompted the National Economic Development
Council to speculate recently that the UK has the worst of both worlds in
industrial relations. Unlike the US, the UK has had sufficient collective
bargaining to push wages up but has not been centralised enough to follow
Scandinavia and Germany in co-ordinating pay in line with what the economy
can afford.
But following the US path may not help to keep wages down, as collective
bargaining is no longer the only, or even the main, culprit in high pay
deals. Between 1979 and 1990, the real earnings of manual workers, mainly
covered by collective bargaining, rose only 11 per cent, compared with a 33
per cent rise for non-manual workers, the vast bulk of whom are not covered
by collective bargaining.
So there is unlikely to be strong political or employer pressure for a
US-style solution, but the unions still face a slow dwindling of their
influence. Will they be able to halt that trend?
They will only by making better use of their meagre resources. Many unions
still do not know what a departmental budget is and many union leaders are
too preoccupied with politics to manage their organisations efficiently.
Breaking the links with the Labour party might help. So, too, could a
further concentration of functions at the TUC.
Labour's defeat makes more likely a historic merger between the two great
general unions, the GMB and the TGWU, to add to the other mega-unions.
Unison, the 1.4m strong mega-union planned for the public sector, should
make it easier for the highly centralised public sector unions to deal with
the challenge of de-centralisation by allowing them to fund bargaining
expertise at local level.
But in the longer run, as collective bargaining over pay withers, union
survival will depend on finding a role which complements the growing
importance of the law at work. Acas, the government conciliation service,
last year reported another record work-load for industrial tribunals.
One pointer to the future could be the attempts by the National
Communications Union, the main union in British Telecom, to expand outside
its dwindling base into the fast growing but mainly non-union communications
sector.
The NCU is unlikely to win traditional pay bargaining rights at Mercury,
BT's non-union rival, or in the small cable television companies where it is
recruiting. But it hopes to build up a substantial membership on the basis
of legal support in disciplinary and redundancy cases, health and safety
expertise, and the union discount services, such as cheap loans, insurance
and travel.
In smaller companies, unions like the NCU hope to play a quasi-personnel
role advising employers as well as employees on employment law. In larger
companies, the unions might also find a role dealing with the many
grievances that arise when collective bargaining is abolished and replaced
with individual performance measurement and individualised pay packets.
Advisory organisations providing services to individual employees may not be
a form of trade unionism that the movement's founding fathers would
recognise, but it is the best hope for British trade unionism in the 21st
century.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Waiting for Denmark
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS no need to panic when the Danes rejected the Maastricht agreement
on European union last Tuesday. So far, the British government has not done
so. There was an initial wobble over whether or not to postpone debate on
the bill enacting the treaty, but since then the prime minister has, quite
rightly, played for time. His government will respond pragmatically to
events as they unfold. Meanwhile, it will follow the plan agreed by the
foreign ministers in Oslo, which is to proceed as if the Danes, having
voiced their dissatisfaction, can be relied on to come round later.
Any other strategy would be immediately destructive. As leader of the
Conservative party, Mr Major must take notice of the growing strength of the
anti-federalists, while staying true to the delicate balance he worked so
hard to establish during the negotiations. As head of government, he must be
sensitive to the switch in national sentiment away from support for the
Maastricht accord, without being seen to abandon his commitment to both the
European Union and Britain's place 'at the heart of it'. As president of the
EC from July 1, he must consider the interests of a community of 12, and the
possible future of a club with perhaps 20 or more members.
Yet there is always danger in a minefield, even when you proceed with
extreme caution, and especially when you move ahead in a straight line. The
bill to ratify the Maastricht deal will have to be withheld from further
parliamentary consideration until the whips can be certain they will get it
through. The Labour party is aware that a government with a majority of only
21 can be embarrassed, particularly on an issue on which the ruling party is
divided.
Another upset
The Irish electorate, thought to be in favour of a 'yes' vote, may cause
another upset at their referendum in 10 days' time. If they accept the deal
they may temporarily neutralise the effect of the Danish rejection, but that
would not be the end of it. A popular vote called for by President
Mitterrand follows later in the year. The polls suggest that the French
electorate will not reject the deal, but in its present mood its response to
a long summer 'anti' campaign cannot be taken for granted.
At the same time, the pressure for a British referendum is growing. The
anti-federalists see it as a glorious opportunity to smash the Maastricht
deal. The Labour party has not succumbed to the temptation to make mischief,
but the possibility is always there. There is a decent argument in favour of
a British consultation, namely that since all the parties contesting the
general election in April were in favour the public has not had an
opportunity to vote on the proposed treaty. Against this must be set the
fact that no fringe anti-EC election candidates have succeeded in making an
impact. Yet the weekend polls suggest there is strong public support for a
chance for the British people to have a direct voice in the proceedings.
Theoretical merits
The theoretical merits of the case are, however, outweighed by the practical
damage that a government espousal of a referendum would do. It could be
widely misinterpreted at home as a chance to vote 'against the common
market'. In the rest of the community, it would almost certainly be seen as
a reversion to the traditional, ever-negative, insular opposition to all
things European that has kept Britain on the sidelines for most of the past
40 years. It would weaken the authority of Britain's EC presidency when
there is much work to do, not least on enlargement and the community budget.
What was agreed at Maastricht was imperfect, but then any closely-negotiated
agreement between 12 states is likely to be. It does, however, represent a
workable way forward for European union, in a direction that should give
greater comfort to those who wish to preserve the strength of national
governments than to the proponents of a super-state. The EC does not need to
become a superstate to achieve the cohesion needed to compete economically
with Japan and the US and to reinforce its position as the pillar of
political stability in a continent of shifting forces. But to achieve these
ends, the Community needs workable co-operative mechanisms of the kind the
12 sought at Maastricht. The excitable politics of referendums do not alter
that.

FT  08 JUN 92 / EC sports shoe quota treads on a few toes: A footwear
dispute is forcing Brussels to tackle curbs on imports from non-Community
countries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The chill wind of global competition is beginning to blow through the
European market in espadrilles and galoshes.
National trade experts and European Commission officials have seen an awful
lot of shoes over the past few weeks. They range from smart ladies' court
shoes, imported into the UK for just Pounds 3, and selling very nicely thank
you at Pounds 9.99 the pair, to top-of-the-range 'pump' training shoes,
which are snapped up for more than Pounds 54.90.
All these shoes are made in the People's Republic of China. The difference
between them is that, following agreement by trade officials last Thursday,
EC imports of waterproof footwear and beach-shoes should be completely
unrestricted from January 1 1993, while court shoes and trainers are likely
to be subject to a Community-wide quota.
The agreement has implications beyond the price and style of footwear in a
single European market. If the decision is confirmed at a meeting of EC
member states, to be held within a few weeks, it could represent an
important test case for reform of the chaotic system of national quotas
between EC members and external trading partners.
The sensitivities of reform are manifest in the shoes saga. While a number
of parents would doubtless welcome some Community-wide restriction on their
offspring's purchase of expensive training shoes, the quota proposal has
trodden on the toes of several companies. Nike, Reebok, LA Gear and others
have all employed legal counsel to fight their case in Brussels.
Their lawyers and lobbyists argue that the political point of imposing a
Community quota - to protect the EC footwear industry and the 500,000 or so
jobs dependent on it - is not relevant in the case of trainers. The
so-called 'high-tech' shoes which spearhead the lucrative market are not
made in the EC. A quota will needlessly increase costs, and possibly prices.
But Brussels officials are more concerned to tackle the fundamental trade
question: with the advent of the single market, what should be done about
residual national quotas applied over decades to imports of everything from
bicycles to umbrellas made in so-called 'state trading countries' - China,
North Korea, Vietnam?
These countries are outside the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade
(Gatt); as a result, the EC can freely impose trade restrictions and duties.
The problem is that individual national restrictions do not work. For
example, Britain - the only country this week to oppose a Community-wide
quota - has a tough national limit on Chinese shoe imports, but the Irish
Republic has no limit. As a result, Commission officials say there has been
a 380 per cent increase in Chinese shoes imported into Ireland in the first
quarter of this year. Trainers are crossing the Irish Sea in huge numbers.
In other areas of trade, the national quotas are a standing joke. 'We get
people calling us up saying: 'We can't export into the UK because the
British quota is used up - which other countries are free?' ' says one
Commission official.
When internal EC frontier controls are abolished at the end of this year,
national limits will be even more difficult to enforce, so the Commission
has to decide how to rationalise the network of restrictions. It has two
options: to 'communitise' - to set a single Community quota, enforceable at
external EC frontiers - or to liberalise.
Reform of the system of restrictions likely to be a painfully slow process.
This is mainly because the history of commercial links with state trading
countries is not really about trade at all, but about politics. Central and
east European nations used to be classified as state trading countries, and
movement to harmonise national restrictions was imperceptibly slow. That was
the case until one Friday in 1988, when member states suddenly decided that
Hungary was emerging from behind the Iron Curtain, and a Brussels official
had to prepare a regulation abolishing all EC trade curbs affecting it by
Monday.
In the case of China, it will take some time to find the same political
will. But in the meantime the Commission is trying to chip away at the
national quotas. For the trainer manufacturers, however, the fight is not
over: national experts must meet again to discuss member states' technical
objections to the measure, including its effect on the sports shoe market.
But Commission officials believe the fuss kicked up by the sports shoe
companies is less important than the battle Brussels appears to have won
with the member states. If agreement on a harmonised quota can be turned
into a formal decision, the way could finally be opened to further
simplification of the byzantine structure of individual barriers to trade
with non-EC countries before the end of the year.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Arts: Prokofiev's October
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Festival Hall on Saturday, Neeme Jarvi conducted the Philharmonia in
a typically adventurous programme (sponsored by AFG). In the middle came
Mozart's clarinet concerto, with large, impassioned choral cantatas by Arvo
Part and Prokofiev jostling it from either side.
The Mozart soloist was the superb Richard Stoltzman: faultless line, and
subtle as ever, but more buttoned-up than his norm. Stoltzman seemed to be
aiming to elevate it above its amiable station. Less delicacy would have
been more fun.
Not the least interesting thing about Part's and Prokofiev's monster
cantatas was that they proved to be, respectively, so much worse and so much
better than one might have expected. The 'dissident' Estonian composer has
described his 1968 Credo - banned after its first performance - as 'the
turning-point of my entire creative output': in it he foreswore his earlier,
unpopular flirtation with 12-note composing in favour of stern white-note
tonality and Russian Orthodox piety, the neo-mediaeval, crypto-minimalist
style that has made him a cult figure now.
Yet his Credo is just a piece of raw music-theatre, sincere though its
motives may have been. It begins and ends with churchly pastiche from the
choir. The central episode, however, consists of increasingly dissonant
music which culminates in an ultra-loud improvised cacophony, 90
Prokofiev's 1937 October Cantata should have been much worse, like most of
those Soviet works by composers who were made offers that they couldn't
refuse. Not only did it have the approved popular extravagances - an extra
military band, a percussion section swollen by machine-gun imitations and a
siren for the 'Revolution' set piece, and a team of six accordions - but
most of the words were taken straight from speeches by Lenin and Stalin.
At the close of this first British performance it was bizarre, though
poignant, to hear the Philharmonia Chorus declare (in hopeless Russian) that
'the blood our people shed' was 'strengthening faith in our powers and
mobilising us to a new struggle to win new victories for communism'. Yet
much of the music Prokofiev devised was sour and abrasive enough that no
premiere transpired. Only in 1966, when Prokofiev - and Stalin - had been
dead for 13 years, was October at last performed. By then the Stalin
settings (including the finale]) had become unacceptable and were duly
omitted.
As Jarvi demonstrated, October is an unbridled shivaree, but also a parade
of honest Prokofiev trouvailles. Broad lyrical lines, often angular and
underpinned by a hard, relentless pulse ;baleful churnings, that were never
the stuff to give the troops; for the orotund propaganda heights, a prosaic
kind of fervour in dogged even-notes.
October illuminates Prokofiev's transition from eager European cosmopolite
back to prudently Sovietised Russian, more vividly than anything else he
composed at that crucial time. We are in debt yet again to Jarvi's intrepid
foraging.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB Bank Scotland, one of the more successful parts of the TSB Group, has
found its new chief executive from within its own ranks. It is bringing back
to Scotland Alastair Dempster, a 51-year-old Scot who is currently chief
executive of TSB Bank Channel Islands.
The job became vacant when Charles Love, a long-serving TSB man, left to
become chief executive of the Clydesdale Bank, the Glasgow-based institution
which belongs to National Australia Bank.
Dempster joined TSB from Royal Bank of Scotland in 1986. He was TSB's
director of commercial banking and international until 1991 when he moved to
the Channel Islands.
Whereas Love latterly combined running TSB Bank Scotland with being head of
branch banking, which is run from Birmingham, Dempster will concentrate
purely on Scotland.
TSB Bank Scotland is the fourth largest bank north of the border, after
Royal Bank of Scotland, Bank of Scotland and Clydesdale.
In the year to October 31 1991 its profits grew by 26 per cent (to Pounds
77m).

FT  08 JUN 92 / Economics: UK data expected to confirm fears that inflation
is 'not yet licked'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE emphasis in the UK this week has been very much on inflation. The annual
rate of retail price inflation in May is expected to confirm the
Chancellor's fears that inflation is 'not yet licked', with the City
forecasting a rise of 4.4 per cent in the year to May. In April the annual
rate was 4.3 per cent.
Although the downward progress of retail price inflation has been bumpy,
producer price inflation - the prices of goods at the factory gate - has
been making better progress. The annual rate has fallen from 5.1 per cent in
November last year to 3.8 per cent in April. The City expects producer price
inflation to drop again in May to 3.7 per cent.
May producer prices are also expected to have risen in the US. Economists
are forecasting a monthly rise of 0.3 per cent, which would be the biggest
monthly increase in seven months. This would mainly reflect higher energy
prices.
With retail demand showing signs of growth in all the major sectors of the
economy of the US, retail sales are also expected to have risen quite
strongly in May.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Supervisors 'confused' on functions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUPERVISORS are confused about what they do and where they fit into company
structures, according to a Confederation of British Industry report
published today.
The report says that in some companies supervisors 'form a distinct
organisational tier which can become the 'piggy in the middle', trusted
entirely by neither management nor workforce and confused about their own
role'.
The competence of the UK's more than 1m supervisors has a significant effect
on business productivity, and the report, Focus on the First Line,
contributes to recent concern about the standard of supervision in the UK.
The National Economic Development Office last year criticised Britain's
supervisors as badly trained, especially in comparison with those in
Germany. A second study found that 96 per cent did not see improving
productivity as their most important goal.
Training for supervisors remains unsatisfactory and will have to adapt
because the job itself is changing rapidly, the CBI says.
The widespread move away from multi-tiered management means supervisors are
acquiring new roles as team leaders who support their workers rather than
deploying, inspecting and controlling them.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Councils urge pay talks shake-up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FUNDAMENTAL changes are to be considered for determining the pay of more
than 1.5m local-authority workers as employers respond to the challenges
presented by the creation of Britain's biggest trade union.
A confidential memorandum by the employers' lead negotiator in national pay
talks suggests single-table bargaining - which would combine negotiations
for all groups of workers - and binding arbitration to settle disputes.
It also floats the possibility of giving more leeway to councils in choosing
which parts of national agreements they wish to adhere to.
Changes to national bargaining arrangements have traditionally been strongly
resisted by unions - particularly Nalgo, which represents white-collar
workers.
Some employers see the creation next year of Unison, comprising Nalgo and
two largely blue-collar unions, Nupe and Cohse, as an opportunity for
reform. The memorandum on possible changes is being circulated to the
local-authority national associations.
In it, Mr Charles Nolda, secretary of the Local Government Management Board,
says that the unions are likely to be forced to come to terms with the case
for fundamental reform. This will be caused by pressures from compulsory
competitive tendering of services and from increasing numbers of authorities
opting out of national pay bargaining.
Mr Nolda says that the attractions of single-table bargaining for employers
include avoiding leapfrogging pressures between pay groups. He warns of the
need, however, to preserve separate pay grade structures for various groups,
at least initially.
'An integrated pay structure would lead to pressure to take a consistent
job-evaluation approach,' he says.
He adds: 'A consistent approach could be either extremely expensive and
likely to force authorities away from using the national agreement for
manual workers; or could lead to very widespread downgrading of many
(white-collar) workers, which is not likely to be deliverable in practice.'
Mr Nolda says that suggestions for a new deal - proposed by him 'just to
prompt discussion' - would be difficult to negotiate with unions and
suggests a timescale of 1994-95.
His suggestions include one negotiating body for all mainstream employees
which would determine an 'overall pay rise each year' as well as common core
conditions including leave, sickness and hours.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Extended reform of 'check-off' considered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT is examining ways of extending its proposed reform of the
'check-off' system - by which employers deduct union dues directly from pay
packets - to include the political levy paid by most trade unionists.
The trade union bill, promised in the Queen's Speech, will include a
proposal requiring union members covered by 'check-off' - about 70 per cent
of the total - to approve of the arrangement every three years.
Department of Employment officials said yesterday that Mr Michael Forsyth,
the employment minister, was considering adding a requirement that union
members on 'check-off' should also positively approve of the political levy
at the same time every three years.
Such a move would further cut the flow of funds to the debt-ridden Labour
party, already facing a cut in union funding. The 1984 Trade Union Act
required unions to vote every 10 years on whether to retain a political fund
but did not change the onus on opting out of paying the political levy.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Experts deny royal reports threaten Crown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS in the British media of difficulties in the marriage of the Prince
and Princess of Wales do not pose any constitutional crisis for the
monarchy, constitutional experts said yesterday.
Lord St John of Fawsley, the former Conservative cabinet minister, said that
the allegations published in The Sunday Times about the marriage, based on
Diana: Her True Story, a book by Andrew Morton, 'cast a shadow over the
monarchy and must be very upsetting for the Queen'. But, he added, 'they
have no effect on the role of the Queen or the role of the Prince of Wales'.
Lord St John said that if the prince and princess divorced, it would have no
effect on the succession. Other constitutional experts agreed.
Lord St John said: 'The role of the royal family as exemplar of family life
and values would be diminished, but there would be no practical effect on
the succession. Divorce is very widespread and accepted.'
In his book Mr Morton claims that Princess Diana attempted to commit suicide
during the 1980s. The book details conversations with friends of the
princess who say her marriage is a sham and that she is convinced she will
never become queen.
Buckingham Palace would not comment on the allegations yesterday.
A spokesman said yesterday that the Princess of Wales had not co-operated
over Mr Morton's book 'in any way whatsoever' and she had not seen the
proofs.
'As far as we are concer-ned it's business as usual. They both have official
engagements today which they will be fulfilling.'
He denied that, in the wake of the divorce of the Princess Royal and the
recent separation of the Duke and Duchess of York, the Palace's failure to
refute the allegations was fuelling a constitutional crisis.
'What constitutional crisis? There is no constitutional crisis,' he said.
He added that it was pointless to speculate about the effect of a divorce of
the Prince and Princess of Wales, because that was a purely hypothetical
situation.
Mr Brian Hanson, legal officer of the General Synod of the Church of
England, confirmed that the Prince of Wales could divorce and still succeed
to the throne with the title of Supreme Governor of the Church. He said:
'The only fetter on the heir to the throne is becoming a Roman Catholic or
marrying a Roman Catholic. In theory a divorce would be possible.'
Lord St John said damage to the monarchy caused by the book would be
limited.
Most of the events described in it and reported by the weekend press took
place in the early 1980s and were out of date. The feeling of the British
people was mostly against the press and not against the royal family.
'I am not worried about the future of the monarchy as a result of this,'
Lord St John said. 'Perhaps it will lead people to take a more realistic
view of the monarchy as ordinary people with ordinary problems.'

FT  08 JUN 92 / Civil servants resist going to the Dogs: Why howls of
protest against moving to Docklands may be in vain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, told the Commons last
week of his plan to move 2,000 of his department's civil servants from
Westminster to London's Docklands, it was attacked by the opposition as 'a
back-door deal to save Canary Wharf'.
The civil servants involved have been even more vociferous. At an angry
meeting of 1,000 staff on Friday there were threats of industrial action,
and one speaker described it as 'shoring up a failed private-sector
experiment'.
Mr Howard said three sites were under study: Canary Wharf; Harbour Exchange;
and East India Dock. The move may be less of a bailing-out operation than at
first appears. There are likely to be significant savings if the government
takes advantage of the depressed property market to snap up high-quality
offices in Docklands at Pounds 15 a sq ft or below, less than half central
London levels.
Although it is possible to relocate to areas well away from London where
rents may be even lower, a move to Docklands is more cost-effective,
according to Ms Honor Chapman of Jones Lang Wootton, the property agents.
'Docklands becomes very competitive if account is taken of the costs of
relocating outside London,' she says. 'These include the cost of making
redundant those who do not wish to move, of relocating staff who are
prepared to move, and of recruiting and training new staff.'
Jones Lang Wootton calculates that a typical relocation from central London
to Docklands could recoup the costs in as little as two or three months. For
Sheffield, the pay-back time would be five to seven years. But Ms Chapman
points out that the key to realising the benefits is how easy it is to
dispose of the offices that are vacated.
The experience of the Export Credits Guarantee Department is salutary. That
government body moved in 1991 from central London to Docklands, but its
original offices in Ludgate Hill remain unlet and the ECGD is now paying
rent on both buildings.
Civil Service moves to Docklands will be cost-effective only if they are
from buildings nearing the end of their leases or due to be vacated.
That is why the 2,700 environment staff working in and around the
department's headquarters in Marsham Street are likely to be the first to
make the move. The department last year decided to demolish those offices
after advice that their crumbling tower blocks would cost Pounds 50m to
repair.
In the same boat is the transport department, which shares the Marsham
Street building. Its plans are less advanced, but about 1,200 staff are
expected to move to Docklands.
The 300 staff who work for the Radiocommunications Agency of the Department
of Trade and Industry will also be moving to Docklands - the lease of their
present offices at Waterloo Bridge House is about to end. The same applies
to the 700 Health and Safety Executive staff in two London offices with
leases that both end in 1994.
Other Whitehall departments likely to join the exodus include the
Agriculture Department and the Lord Chancellor's Department. Parts of Mr
Michael Heseltine's DTI, homeless at present while its Victoria Street
headquarters is stripped of asbestos, may also gravitate to the Isle of
Dogs.
None of that has gone down well with the civil servants in the firing line.
A survey of Marsham Street staff last year found that 90 per cent opposed
moving to Docklands.
The relocation pill was sugared for ECGD staff by a Pounds 500-a-year bonus
for additional travelling time. No such inducements appear to be on offer
this time and, according to Ms Elizabeth Symons of the First Division
Association, the union representing top civil servants, undertakings
apparently given to compensate all staff for additional travelling time have
now been withdrawn.
The unions plan a sustained campaign to stop the moves. Aware that there may
be little public sympathy for civil servants, they plan to focus on the
economics of the move, challenging ministers' assertions that relocation to
Docklands is good value for the taxpayer.
The truth is that relocating civil servants to Docklands might well be an
astute financial move. It is unlikely, however, that those who must journey
to work on the Isle of Dogs rather than Whitehall will see that as a
convincing argument.
LONDON'S Docklands are expected to become a regional office centre like
Croydon, according to a poll of the property industry by Gallup, the
research company, Vanessa Houlder writes.
In a survey commissioned by Chartered Surveyors Weekly and Building Magazine
of 80 fund managers and property directors, 78 per cent said Docklands would
be regarded as a regional office centre of immediate importance within 10
years. Nearly one in six expected that it would eventually rank alongside
the West End and the City.
Five per cent thought it would not be regarded as an option for any form of
office accommodation.
A quarter thought the collapse of the Canary Wharf project would slow
economic recovery in the country as a whole. More than a third of the
investment and development companies (35 per cent) thought Canary Wharf's
being in administration would adversely affect their own lines of credit.
Canary Wharf's difficulties would have quite a depressing effect on the
property market, according to 36 per cent, while 48 per cent though it would
be 'not very depressive'. It is expected to be let at a rent of Pounds 14 a
sq ft on average.

FT  08 JUN 92 / BT assesses TV service using telephone lines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecom has found a way of delivering a television service along
existing telephone wires and is exploring the commercial feasibility of
offering a service to homes.
BT engineers have demonstrated that the project is technically feasible, and
good-quality pictures have been received using ordinary telephone cables.
Mr Steve Maine, director of BT's visual and broadcast services division, is
beginning to assess the commercial implications and whether BT would need
broadcasting partners to go ahead.
If extra television channels could be offered to everyone who has a
telephone, such a system might be a powerful competitor to cable and
possibly even satellite television.
It can cost more than Pounds 30m to build a cable television network serving
100,000 homes.
Only one channel of television can be delivered down a telephone line at a
time, but if computer-controlled switches are installed at central points -
say at telephone exchanges - viewers could choose from a range of channels.
Mr Maine believes that the first and possibly most economic application
would be to send individual feature films from a central library - a
telephone equivalent of the video shop.
Assessing the commercial potential of television by telephone is still in
its early stages, but Mr Maine has not ruled out joint ventures with
broadcasters and cable television channels.
Over the past few years BT has been pulling out of cable television and has
only a few stakes left, including that in Westminster Cable, a pioneer cable
television company.
The corporation's visual and broadcast services division, which covers
everything from videoconferencing to linking broadcasters with their
transmitters, has an annual turnover of about Pounds 150m.
Increasingly, cable companies see providing telephone services in opposition
to BT as an attractive business. The company is likely to face growing
competition from the cable television companies, which are backed by large
North American telephone groups, but it had decided to compete by improving
its core services.

PRE-EMPTIVE meetings called by Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the

expenditure in 1993-94 from far exceeding the government's target.
A rare series of negotiations by Mr Portillo appears to have trimmed the
most excessive spending ambitions of cabinet members, but they have still
submitted bids that together are much higher than the Pounds 245bn planning
total pencilled in by the Treasury in January.
Among the departments likely to face the biggest squeeze are defence, health
and environment. The Welsh and Scottish Offices have also been under special
scrutiny this year.
Mr Portillo will be looking for modest public-sector pay rises, including
MPs' allowances. The Top Salaries Review Body report on the allowances is
due in the next few weeks.
Usually, bilateral meetings between Treasury and cabinet ministers do not
take place until after the cabinet has set the framework for the spending
round at the beginning of July.
Mr Portillo's early start reflects a widespread fear in Whitehall that, with
the general election out of the way but public borrowing high, this year's
negotiations will be the most fraught since the early 1980s.
Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, is pushing for a cushion to soften
the impact of the new council tax. Treasury officials will look to the lower
end of the Pounds 1bn to Pounds 4bn estimated for the cost of the
transitionary arrangements from the poll tax. The Treasury will also want
tight control on housing expenditure and on the City Challenge programme for
urban regeneration projects.
On health, the Treasury will argue that spending rounds before the election
were generous and that there is scope for increasing enterprise within the
National Health Service. Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, will
point to the prime minister's commitment to continuing real increases in
spending and to how the flat property market has trimmed NHS income from
asset sales.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, who has yet to meet Mr Portillo to
discuss his bid formally, is preparing a case against a clampdown on
spending. He will argue that change can be made only slowly and will involve
redundancy costs.
Mr Portillo is also likely to find a tough battle in settling the budget for
the employment department. Mrs Gillian Shephard, employment secretary, wants
additional resources for the Training and Enterprise Councils. With
unemployment still rising, treasury officials are concerned about the value
for money of schemes such as Employment Training, run by the Tecs.
Mr John MacGregor, transport secretary, is likely to find Treasury pressure
on his department's roads programme and on any extra spending on transport
links to London's Docklands, including the Jubilee Line extension.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Post offices may bid for lottery sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POST Office Counters, which runs Britain's 19,000 post offices, is seeking
clearance from the Department of Trade and Industry to bid for a central
role in operating the planned national lottery.
The organisation, which has 28m customers a week and carries out 150
different types of counter transaction, believes that it can be a
front-runner among competitors to help provide a nationwide network of
outlets for lottery ticket sales.
The government is pledged to have the lottery operating by 1994. It is
expected to raise at least Pounds 1bn a year for sport, the arts and
charities, and will be run on a day-to-day basis by the private sector under
contract.
Competition to operate it might be tough, with the Horserace Totalisator
Board, known as the Tote, and the pools promoters among possible candidates.
At least two leading merchant banks are also thought to be actively engaged
in preparing proposals which might involve substantial expenditure.
The DTI, as the sponsoring ministry, has to agree to the Post Office
Counters initiative. The Post Office Act has tended to inhibit deals with
the private sector, but management is hopeful that it will be permitted to
submit its proposals to ministers.
Post Office Counters' interest is limited to offering, in return for a fee,
points of sale for the lottery, which would be administered by a partner. It
has privately calculated that as many as 30,000 outlets might be needed,
which would require a supplementary network of sale points to be provided by
other partners.
The organisation, which is having talks with potential partners, is hoping
that DTI ministers will not object in principle to its plan.
It is also pressing its case at Westminster by emphasising its need to
secure new sources of income in the face of a decline in some of its
traditional counter business. With its 10,000 rural post offices losing
Pounds 20m a year, Post Office Counters' management is also emphasising that
additional income sources are required to assure their future.
The deadline for representations in response to the government's lottery
white paper is at the end of this month. The government is expected to set
out more detailed proposals later in the year.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Lloyd's levy spotlights woes: The controversy over the
market's move to boost its guarantee fund
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE decision last week by the troubled Lloyd's of London to boost the size
of its central guarantee fund to Pounds 1bn has highlighted concern about
the insurance market's solvency.
Lloyd's says the extra Pounds 500m being raised by a one-off levy on all
Names - the individuals whose assets provide its capital - demonstrates its
capacity to meet all insurance claims.
The market's critics have dismissed the new measure as window-dressing that
does little to address fundamental weaknesses in Lloyd's capital base.
Worries have emerged this year because potentially several thousand Names
may be unable to pay for 1989 insurance losses that included those stemming
from disasters such as Hurricane Hugo. Lloyd's reports its 1989 results this
month and, according to Chatset, a company that monitors the market's
performance, the bill may well top Pounds 2bn, with a substantial minority
of weaker Names bearing the brunt.
According to Mr Alan Lord, Lloyd's chief executive, the new levy shows that
'in hard times we can cope from our own resources'.
In the first instance, the money is to be obtained from Lloyd's premium
trust funds, into which insurance premiums earned by Lloyd's syndicates are
paid.
Names underwriting in the three years affected by the levy - 1990, 1991 and
1992 - will not have to pay anything until June 1993 when the first of a
series of three one-off levies - each equivalent to 1.66 per cent of stamp
(the amount of premium a Name is allowed to underwrite according to Lloyd's
rules) will be charged.
The charge will be deducted by agents from the Name's annual profits or
added to their loss, in the same way as other personal expenses are treated.
Although the new money will not be raised until next year, it should equip
Lloyd's to meet claims that Names worst affected by the loss-making 1988 and
1989 years cannot pay. Where individual Names have insufficient assets to
pass the solvency test, amounts from the central fund will be earmarked to
meet the shortfall.
The measure has been generally welcomed by the market's agencies - which
manage syndicates - as well by the Association of Lloyd's Members, which
represents more than 9,000 of the market's 22,400 Names still underwriting.
Describing the levy as 'tantamount to a rights issue', Mr Robert Hiscox, one
prominent agency executive, says: 'It makes us more robust. We'll be more
liquid, able to meet claims and face up to litigation.'
According to a spokesman for the ALM: 'There will be a hell of a scream from
some Names. But it is an essential prerequisite for managing our way out of
the next two years.'
The measure also gives Lloyd's more time to discuss a possible bail-out plan
for the worst affected Names announced in April by Mr David Coleridge,
Lloyd's chairman.
Many Names are critical, however, especially those facing heavy losses. Mr
John Rew, co-editor at Chatset and himself a loss-making Name, says the levy
will 'cascade' losses at present faced by a minority of Names across the
market as a whole and contribute to what he describes as a general
'meltdown', with the market's capital base falling from its present level of
Pounds 10.1bn to as little as Pounds 4bn by the mid 1990s.
Mr Rew's analysis is based on a cautious assessment of the value of Lloyd's
assets and a downbeat view of the market's performance in 1990 and 1991.
Chatset is confident its forecast that losses in 1990 will amount to Pounds
1.15bn and to Pounds 750m in 1991.
As those Names remaining in the market pay their share of those losses -
which, in the market's three-year accounting system, will be reported in
1993 and 1994 - there will be a rapid erosion in the value of the Names'
assets, estimated by Mr Rew to be about Pounds 5.8bn rather than a figure of
more than Pounds 7bn claimed by Lloyd's. The resources of the 'average'
Name, writing about Pounds 400,000 in premium income, will be exhausted in
1994, Mr Rew believes.
At Lloyd's, Mr Rew's views are widely criticised as over-pessimistic and
even apocalyptic. Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting
Agents Association, says that with insurance rates rising sharply, many of
his members are becoming more confident about the future.
Chatset is sticking to its guns. Mr Rew says help from outside in the form
of tax breaks and credit lines is needed.
He adds: 'The only hope that Lloyd's has is to save the capital base while
it is still there. A lifeboat must be put in place by the authorities.'

FT  08 JUN 92 / Tribune Group attempts revival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRIBUNE GROUP, once a vigorous power base of Labour's parliamentary left
wing, is attempting to rejuvenate its radical traditions and so shake off
its recent reputation for passive acquiescence to the party leadership.
For some time, the group's meetings have been poorly attended, giving it
little influence on the party leadership. Now, after the election of Ms
Clare Short, MP for Birmingham Ladywood, as chairman, and Mr Peter Hain, MP
for Neath, as secretary, an effort is under way to revive the group 'as a
centre of renewal' and radical thinking.
In a circular to supporters at the weekend, Ms Short proposed that the group
should take Labour's general election defeat as an opportunity to remodel
Tribune as a lively forum for debate.
She writes: 'After previous election defeats, there has usually been some
shared analysis on the left as to why the defeat took place and what needed
to be done to take the party forward. On this occasion, there is no agreed
answer to these questions. This suggests a need for a period of open, well
informed and tolerant debate, rather than a need to organise for one
grouping or faction to seek to take control of the party.'
Her circular praises the party's organisational achievements but criticises
its over-reliance on 'polling and glitz', and its economic policy as 'deeply
cautious'.
Mr Bryan Gould last night urged Labour to adopt a radical anti-racist
programme. His call came in a policy document issued as part of his campaign
for the party leadership. He said: 'We must not shy away from our duty to
put forward a radical anti-racist programme, make clear our commitment to
equal opportunities, and put our own house in order.'

FT  08 JUN 92 / Major urged to head off BCCI litigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEITH VAZ, the Labour MP, yesterday urged the prime minister to intervene
in negotiations between the shareholders and creditors in the collapsed Bank
of Credit and Commerce International to prevent lengthy litigation.
His plea comes in advance of consideration today in the High Court of the
liquidation plan prepared for BCCI by Touche Ross, the accountancy firm,
which includes compensation of Dollars 1.7bn (Pounds 926m) to creditors.
The creditors adjourned a previous hearing to seek 'clarification' of the
settlement announced in February by Touche Ross and already approved by the
government of Abu Dhabi, the bank's majority shareholder. Creditors
criticised the size of the settlement and have threatened to take the risk
of suing for higher returns rather than accept it.
Mr Vaz would like the High Court hearing adjourned. He called on Mr John
Major to establish a panel to recover further assets from the bank and to
assemble compensation measures including pensions for the 1,200 BCCI staff.
'If the creditors sue, it will be disastrous and put back any compensation
agreement for years,' he said.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Showpiece declaration pleases nobody much
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Rio Declaration, which world leaders will sign at the end of the summit,
is supposed to be the showpiece of the event. Unfortunately, virtually
everybody thinks it is a flabby document, but no one wants to be the first
to pull it apart.
It consists of 27 principles enshrining what participants believe are the
tenets of sound planetary management. Some are obvious: the first says human
beings 'are entitled to a healthy and productive life in harmony with
nature'. Others lay down key objectives, like sustainable development.
Principle 3 reads: 'The right to development must be fulfilled so as to
equitably meet developmental and environmental needs of present and future
generations.'
A third set reflects the tough negotiations that went into it. For example,
Principle 2 recognises countries' rights to exploit their own natural
resources, a point which Third World states, particularly the tropical
hardwood growers, wanted in. But this right is balanced by an equal
obligation to ensure that 'activities within their jurisdiction or control
do not cause damage to the environment of other states'.
Others stress the need to eradicate poverty and aid developing countries. In
Principle 7, the industrial countries acknowledge a special responsibility
'in view of the pressures their societies place on the global environment'.
Free trade, more information, better environmental legislation, women's
rights, proper compensation for pollution victims - these are some of the
themes.
The main reason why the declaration is so flawed is that it was a compromise
from the start. Originally, there was to be an 'Earth Charter', 10 or so
commandments in simple language. That was thrown out because every country
wanted to alter the commandments to protect its own interests. The
declaration prepared instead is a highly political document in UN
bureaucratese, so finely balanced that to alter even one comma might upset
it.
'We're not enthusiastic about it. We'd like to see an Earth Charter which
would be sharper, more focused and more accessible,' says Mr Jean Charest,
the Canadian environment minister.
Other participants have more specific criticisms. The Israelis are cross
about Principle 23, which refers to 'people under occupation', and the
Vatican is opposed to Principle 8, which talks about 'demographic policies'.
The question, though, is whether anyone will demand that the agreed text be
re-opened. The fine balance means changes to one part would require changes
to others, setting off a chain reaction which could destroy the whole
document. 'It would be a mistake to re-open the Rio declaration,' says Mr
Klaus Topfer, German environment minister.
Much could however hinge on the US position. Mr William Reilly, the
administrator of the Environment Protection Agency, says: 'No country is
fully satisfied with it. We would have liked a different thing. We have not
decided yet whether to seek a reopening.'
The US does not like the parts which lay blame for environmental damage. It
also objects to a section which refers to the 'right to development'. This
could put economic rights above human rights, it fears, leading in extreme
cases to child labour.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Keeping up the pressure
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
What happens after Rio is all over? Will the participating countries just
disperse and forget all about it, or will someone be keeping up the pressure
for action on the environment?
The main proposal - for which there is growing acceptance - is for a
Sustainable Development Commission which would be part of the UN. This would
be similar to the UN Commission on Human Rights: it would monitor countries'
record on environmental protection, and apply 'peer group pressure' to those
who lagged behind.
The Commission would report to the Economic and Social Council, which
reports to the General Assembly, and would have over 50 members.
The exact details will be decided by the General Assembly in the autumn.
Mother Nature is delivering her own message to the Earth Summit. Any doubts
that delegates might have about global warming have been dispelled by a
sweltering heat wave which has engulfed Rio. Even though it is supposed to
be mid-winter, temperatures yesterday soared past 40 degrees Celsius. far
above the seasonal norm. Some delegates took the opportunity of the Sunday
break to snatch moments at the beach - where they must have ruminated about
the dangers of climate change.
Pollution can be caused by many things - including war. Invasion-ravaged
Kuwait has a specially poignant message for the summit. Its delegation
office is decked in grisly posters of burning oil wells, shattered homes and
oil-covered beaches.
The tiny oil state has brought a relatively large contingent of 50 people,
including consultants and scientists, who are pushing the message that
Kuwait is on the mend.
'We want people to know what happened during the invasion, and also after
the liberation,' says Dr Abdulwahad Alfouzan, the minister of health.
Only a few steps away from Kuwait's expansive office stands Iraq's much more
modest one-room presence. It contains a large picture of President Saddam
Hussein. But while the Emir of Kuwait will be coming at the end of this week
for the ceremonial signing, Mr Saddam, sensing he would not be enormously
welcome, has dispatched foreign minister Tariq Aziz instead.
The Brazilian Indians' claim that they know what is best for the jungle led
to some consternation in Rio over the weekend when a well-known Indian
spokesman appeared in the parallel non-governmental conference trying to
sell a large spotted jaguar skin. Mario Juruna said he had killed the 8-foot
animal and was determined to sell it, adding: 'If Indians were free they
would sell alligators, wild cat and other skins.'

FT  08 JUN 92 / Standard Chartered hopes rise for missing Pounds 200m:
Indian government takes powers to seize assets of fraud suspects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and R C MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Indian government has given itself power to seize assets of brokers and
others suspected of fraud, boosting the chances of Standard Chartered and
other banks recovering much of the large sums owed to them.
On Saturday, the government passed an ordinance giving it power to seize
money diverted from the banking system as far back as April 1 1991. That
period covers dealings involving Standard Chartered, which the Indian
central bank says is owed Rs10.55bn (Pounds 202m).
The order will save the UK-based bank from having to pursue its claims
through the courts, which could take years.
The government also took powers to set up a special court to try allegations
of fraud and corruption in the Bombay stock market scandal. Irregular
securities trading, in which Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay broker, and others
raised large sums from banks for stock market manipulation, is at the heart
of India's worst financial scandal.
The 10 so far charged appeared in court in Bombay on Saturday and were
remanded in custody.
Mr S Venkitaraman, governor of India's central bank, said the scandal would
not slow the pace of liberalisation of India's financial markets, though it
had given ammunition to opponents of reform.
He said there was nothing he could have done to have prevented the Rs30.8bn
(Pounds 600m) fraud on the country's banking system, which has led to calls
for his resignation.
There had been frauds in several banks, including Standard Chartered, with
many deals not being reported to the bank's managers, he said.
'No central bank in the world has a policing system for that.'
Mr Venkitaraman said he had been aware of similar abuses a year ago, though
on a smaller scale, and had told banks then to make sure there were adequate
controls.
The governor has been criticised because two banks at the centre of the
fraud - State Bank of India and National Housing Bank - are owned by the
Reserve (central) Bank and have bank representatives on their boards. Mr
Venkitaraman said he had no direct control over the banks, but that the
government was responsible for appointing their top managers. 'I can neither
hire nor fire the management.'
The central bank's ownership of banks apparently involved in fraud has
caused concern in some quarters about its objectivity in investigating and
apportioning blame in the affair. It has put pressure on ANZ Grindlays,
through which some of the money was diverted, to set aside funds to repay
Rs4bn to the National Housing Bank.
While he denied that the Reserve Bank's main aim was to recover money for
its subsidiaries, Mr Venkitaraman said: 'There is a conflict because we put
in share capital. It is unfortunate.'
The central bank should not be represented on the boards of commercial banks
and there should be complete separation of ownership and regulation, he
said.
In the meantime, the Reserve Bank was confident that it would trace much of
the missing money.
'We know where the money has gone. We are acting on some leads, and are
still confident we will be able to recover assets.' He refused to say
whether provision made by Standard Chartered, which has set aside Pounds
50m, was adequate.

FT  08 JUN 92 / The European Market: Advertising market grows as it
fragments - As European media outlets increase, users must decide which one
is best for them
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME Dollars 53bn will be spent on display advertising in 16 countries of
the European Economic Area (EC plus Efta countries) this year - fast
catching up with the Dollars 59bn US market.
But though the European display advertising market is becoming as important
as the US for big international advertisers, significant differences between
the two - the lack of a fairly homogeneous culture and common language -
mean would-be pan-European advertisers face more problems in hitting their
target audiences than in the US.
Moreover, increasing media fragmentation in Europe - a pattern well
established in the US - is giving advertisers and media buyers more
headaches. And finally, the European market has the extra frisson of an
increasing concentration of media ownership.
Four different groups tussle over the Dollars 53bn (Pounds 29bn) cash pool:
the owners of the media where the ads appear; the advertising agencies who
make the ads; the media buyers who buy the space; and the advertisers
themselves, who want better-targeted advertising space for the same, or
less, cost. In the European market, advertising expenditure is unlikely to
grow by more than 2 per cent in real terms this year. That slow growth is
putting a squeeze on everyone.
For both media owners and media buyers it is becoming more important to know
what type of consumer sees the media concerned; only through more refined
targeting can both sides continue to persuade advertisers to use them,
rather than a competitor. The piggy-in-the-middle, an advertiser -
particularly of fast-moving consumer goods - requires increasingly
sophisticated advice about where and when to place the advertising: without
careful market analysis, money could disappear down the drain.
In the last decade the European media market has witnessed a proliferation
of new outlets; in 1981 there were just 39 television channels, but by last
year that had exploded into 66 national terrestrial stations, 82 satellite
channels and another 700 regional and local channels (650 of those in Italy
alone). Across the EEA there are business plans for 40 more.
While satellite television is so far taken by only 3 per cent of European
households, cable television has reached 19 per cent of them - though in
France, Italy, Spain and the UK penetration is less than 3 per cent. The
domestic video recorder has spread to more than half (from a standing start
in 1978) and 60 per cent have remote controls; consumer viewing choice is
greater, faster, easier.
Advertisers have a glut of outlets elsewhere, too. There are now 10,000
different consumer magazine titles in the EEA, 4,200 paid-for and 4,300
free-distribution newspapers. But both magazines and newspapers have seen
their share of advertising revenue drop over the decade: from 26 to 22 per
cent for the former and from 39 to 30 per cent for the latter.
If media fragmentation is a cause for alarm for media owners anxious to keep
their share of advertising revenues, it plays into the hands of media-buying
specialists such as Carat, the largest in Europe, which this year will take
some 12 per cent of the market.
Mr Peter Scott, chief executive of Carat, says: 'Fragmentation of the media
is going to create more choice, more competition, more complexity and
therefore a greater need for research and computer techniques in order to be
able to find out where the audiences are. In the US, Warner delivers 150
different channels in some areas of New York. How do you as an advertiser
know where to go?' Carat is spending Dollars 20m this year on researching
that problem.
At the same time as a swing towards more media outlets, media ownership
across Europe is also becoming concentrated in fewer hands.
Europe's largest independent media buyer, Carat (part of the Aegis group),
has recently published research which indicates that 44 per cent of
television advertising spending - about Dollars 16bn - went to just five
European television groups in 1991; 69 per cent of all advertising was
snapped up by the top 20 individual channels.
In Italy, with a 1991 advertising market of Dollars 7bn, Mr Silvio
Berlusconi's Fininvest group is now estimated to have some 50 per cent of
all advertising revenues.
European publishing is becoming similarly concentrated. In 1991 eight of the
big publishers took 35 per cent of of all magazine advertising in the five
biggest European markets.
Moreover, Carat says that until quite recently (when Pearson sold its share
in the Dutch publisher Elsevier), the 15 top media owners in Europe were all
inter-connected in some way, through part-ownerships in more than 20
different media outlets, television, radio and publishing.
Such concentration of media ownership is also concentrating the minds - and
actions - of buyers. Last year, for the first time, more than 50 per cent of
all display advertising expenditure was channelled through specialist media
space-buyers.
Carat is convinced that, as pan-European media ownership concentrates while
the outlets become more fragmented and niche-like, buyers will have to
become more specialised.
Mr Scott is therefore confident about the future of his own and other
media-buying businesses, at the cost of European media owners: 'Overall, the
cost of advertising is coming down rather than going up. The massive media
inflation of the 1980s is now tailing off, and the inherent profitability of
media owners must be under threat; the power has shifted from media owners
to advertisers and media buyers. An advertiser and media buyer can now
achieve the same thing by going elsewhere, if media owners try to charge
outrageous rates.
'Give satellite another couple of years of penetration and you can start to
say 'no' to inflated charges from other forms of television.'

The Lebanese economy deteriorated sharply in the first third of 1992, the
Beirut Chamber of Commerce and Industry reported at the weekend, writes Lara
Marlowe in Beirut.
Researchers cited decreased activity in most economic sectors, capital
flight after a wave of rumours about some banks, postponement of foreign
reconstruction aid and a fall in the value of the Lebanese pound. Bank
deposits in Lebanon fell to Dollars 5.8bn in March compared with Dollars
6.2bn in March 1991. The central bank's foreign exchange reserves, which
stood at Dollars 1.234bn at the end of last year, fell to Dollars 690m in
March because the bank had tried to shore up the Lebanese pound.

SEVERAL members of the Organisation of American States are considering
military intervention in Haiti, after the failure of diplomatic efforts and
an economic embargo to secure the return to office of ousted president
Jean-Bertrand Aristide, writes Canute James in Kingston.
According to diplomats, several Caribbean and Latin American countries are
discussing 'surgical and selective strikes' in Haiti by a multinational
force. The intention would be to 'weaken the resolve' of the Haitian
military to hold on to power. But President Bush said yesterday he was not
yet thinking about using force and hoped sanctions could be made effective.

JAPANESE opposition parties have held up passage of the controversial United
Nations peacekeeping bill by a marathon display of filibustering,
culminating in a slow voting technique called the 'ox-walk', writes Stefan
Wagstyl in Tokyo.
Exhausted members of the Diet's upper house were last night preparing for a
fourth consecutive all-night session as party leaders argued over the bill,
which would allow Japanese troops to join UN peacekeeping operations. The
bill has divided the country, with supporters wanting Japan to play a bigger
world role and opponents fearful of expanding the military's role. The
ruling Liberal Democratic Party, which forced the bill through the Diet's
lower house last year, hopes today to overcome intense opposition in the
upper house from left-wing parties.

VOTING WITH THE HERD: Election officials in Azerbaijan took the ballot boxes
to the voters yesterday in the case of herdsmen unable to leave their sheep.
The presidential election result could herald the unravelling of the
Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS) and a decisive phase in the war
with Armenia, Reuter reports from Baku.
The Popular Front leader, Mr Abulfaz Elchibey, the likely election victor,
wants Azerbaijan to leave the CIS and UN peace-keepers on the Armenia
border.
Under Mr Elchibey, this oil-producing Transcaucasian nation would lean
towards Turkey in its foreign policy, pursue free-market reforms and take a
cautious line on Nagorno Karabakh.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Threat to D-Mark touches a raw
nerve - Aachen, Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS someone's birthday and the pils and kolsch were going down at full
throttle. A dozen Aacheners in a town centre bar were alternately mourning
and laughing themselves half to death over the topics of the day.
Faces lengthened briefly at the news that Steffi Graf had just lost the
French Open tennis championship to Monica Seles. And, inexplicably, one of
the party had not heard of the death of Benny Hill. 'A great artist. We
needed clowns like him,' he said.
Gitta, the birthday girl, about 65 with cyclamen-carrot hair, stepped into
the breach: 'What we need is more asparagus and more sex for senior
citizens. There's thousands of things to do with asparagus. . .'
'Oh aye, and the city can't tax you on it]'
There was plenty to laugh at and nothing was sacrosanct; the revered 'king
of vegetables' (approaching its seasonal peak), the British royal family
(close to its nadir), plans to house asylum-seekers in converted rail and
road containers, and the 'Genscher peso'.
The proposed single European currency has already found its own local
identity in Aachen in an expression of gentle mockery for the recently
retired foreign minister, Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, combined with something
close to contempt for the gall of those who think a half-baked amalgam of
lesser European currencies can replace the D-Mark.
'The Ecu. What kind of a currency is that? What about Genscher pennies?' How
they roared. No disrespect, Bert explained later. It was a quirk in
pronunciation that made the joke such a hit. The tone of the badinage was
back to asparagus and pensioners' rights.
But seriously, said Bert, he had no objections to the single currency. He
blithely cited the endless assurances from Bonn and the Bundesbank that,
whatever it was called, it would have all the stability and value of the
D-Mark.
Aacheners have so far managed well enough with everything the European
Community has offered. It was in their town, in the late 1970s, that the
German model for the European monetary system was adopted. And it was just
30km down the road in Maastricht that the treaties designed to bind European
political and monetary union were signed.
They live in a border community, a self-proclaimed 'Euregio Maas-Rhein'
encompassing the people, cultures and currencies of Germany, the Netherlands
and Belgium. The local newspaper costs DM1.50, BFr25 or Fl 11.75 depending
on what you have in your pocket. As almost everywhere else in western
Germany, the 12-starred Community banner is part of the civic fixtures and
retailers' fittings.
Bert claims to speak for his friends: the Danes 'do things as they want' and
that is fine. He does not want a referendum on the Maastricht treaties, and
he does not believe last week's TV and radio phone-in polls, which suggested
more than 80 per cent of Germans would vote No if they were asked.
If pressed, he is more worried about Russian-built nuclear weapons all over
eastern Europe, instability beyond the Community's eastern borders, and how
much of his pay packet goes to east Germany. 'The political classes have got
many big jobs to do, and we should ask ourselves if they are big enough to
do them.'
A straw poll of a dozen Maas-Rheinlanders too pleased at the prospect of the
long Whitsun weekend to worry much about subsidiarity suggests that the sole
implication of the Maastricht treaties which has impinged on local
consciousness is the loss of the D-Mark - and it is resented. But Europe is
Europe, with or without the Danes or, in the end, the D-Mark.
Rudi, a local visiting from his new home in Dusseldorf, worries that 'even
I, a businessman who understands the treaties,' cannot properly envision the
outcome when they come fully into effect. The politicians who signed them,
he says, have been irresponsible; too preoccupied with scoring party
political points at home.
'Some people say the Danes did not properly understand Maastricht. If that
is true it must also be true here. We Germans are not so clever.'
There are signs that the 'political classes' are waking up to the reality of
an information gap. Mr Friedrich Bohl, minister in the chancellor's office,
made a ponderous effort at clarification after the Danish referendum shock
last week. Without the union, he said, there would be no European
environmental policy and markets would be lost.
Acknowledging popular concerns, he added there would be no way of stopping
the flow of refugees and Germany would be defenceless against organised
international crime.
The Foreign Ministry, meanwhile, has sponsored a computer quiz game - On the
road to Europe - intended to deepen appreciation of the Community
neighbourhood. It was launched at the Europafest yesterday. Questions
include: Is the French national anthem called La Bouillabaisse? Who or what
is the Iron Lady? and How do Danes decorate their Christmas trees?

FT  08 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: EC reaction to the Danish vote
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST week's Danish vote against the Maastricht treaty sent tremors through
the European Community. Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign
minister, did his best to salvage the remnants of Denmark's European
policies; President Francois Mitterrand called a referendum; Chancellor
Helmut Kohl confronted growing German opposition to European monetary union;
Prime Minister John Major faced a backbench Commons revolt which could
sabotage Britain's bid to play a constructive European role during its
six-month presidency starting next month; and Italy struggled on with the
task of trying to form a government.
EC foreign ministers met in Oslo, and tried to pretend it was business as
usual. Around the continent the voters pondered the confusion - and wondered
what it all meant. Denmark's referendum exposed a deep gulf between the
pro-Maastricht policies of the country's political establishment and the
hopes and fears of ordinary voters.
To assess reaction to last week's events, Financial Times reporters went on
to the streets at the weekend and asked citizens in Britain, France, Germany
and Italy for their views on the Community's post-Copenhagen crisis.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Full implication of closer ties
eludes provinces - Sarzana, Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SARZANA'S European credentials are there for all to see. At the entrance to
this small provincial town on the borders of Liguria and Tuscany is the
large European Community symbol, with its blue background and yellow stars
of the 12 members.
Does Franco, the petrol pump attendant at the nearby garage, worry now that
there may be only 11 real members in the Community? 'Never bothered to count
the stars myself,' he says, slightly embarrassed.
Has he heard of Denmark's decision in a referendum to reject the terms of
closer EC integration? 'Wasn't that the night of the Italian under-21s
against Sweden?' Like most of his fellow countrymen, football is his term of
reference.
Franco is not afraid of Europe and has never questioned whether he or Italy
might not be part of it. Europe and the EC are just there. A fact of life.
Sarzana lies astride the ancient Highway No I (the Aurelia) close to the
mouth of the river Magra. Here the mountainous rocky coastline of Liguria
gives way to a fertile narrow plain that gradually broadens out towards
Viarregio and Pisa to the south. Historically, the town controlled access to
the inhospitable hinterland of the central Appennine chain and the rich farm
land of Parma.
This strategic position has long made Sarzana (population 25,000) a trading
centre. The town has also benefited from being close to the marble mines of
Carrara.
But the big change has come in the past 20 years with the construction of
two autostradas, one linking Genoa and Pisa and the other from Parma.
Sarzana has become a wealthy distribution centre - hypermarkets have grown
up on ring roads while the centre of town has acquired boutiques and antique
shops.
It is the kind of place marketing men like to test their new products.
But for the town's citizens, Europe is an awkward product. In the Chamber of
Commerce, at the local trade union office, the rules of the European game
are clear. But for the 'man in the street' notions are vague.
Aldo runs a fruit stall with his mother and two sisters. Is he aware that
Brussels is making regulations which might affect his business? 'I don't
know about the common market; but the big difference in our lives was when
they started building supermarkets on the outskirts of town. We have to
watch our prices. . . We don't have to worry about cheap foreign imports: we
Italians don't like buying foreign produce - we are still used to buying
things in season.'
One of Aldo's customers interjects: 'The common market's been good to us -
why should we think of a referendum? They've given too much money to the
south; but round here people in agriculture have been pretty good at
fiddling money (from Brussels).'
In a newspaper shop a lively discussion begins about the EC even though no
one apparently has paid much attention to the Danish referendum. 'The EC is
good for us - helps our exports,' says a young man with a motorcycle helmet
under his arm. 'They told us about our budget deficit. We can't spend so
much,' says a waiter who has popped in from a neighbouring bar.
The owner of the shop looks on bemused. 'I read the headlines. Selling
newspapers you don't have time to read them. . . mind you, the Danish
referendum wasn't given much prominence. It's political scandals every day
in Italy. Most of my clients prefer Corriere dello Sport and right now its
the Tour of Italy cycling,' she says.
Ana is a 19-year-old medical student from Pisa spending the weekend with her
parents. 'We should have a referendum on Europe, although I doubt there
would be enough signatures.'
Of more than a dozen people 'in the street', Ana is alone in being critical:
'Italy has blindly accepted everything about European integration. People
are fundamentally in favour of belonging to the EC but no one has asked why
and the politicians have not initiated a debate. But how can you have a
meaningful debate when the country has no faith in the politicians?' she
says.
'Thank God for Brussels,' says an antique dealer. 'Our politicians are
useless and the EC has given us our only project - no wonder Italians are in
favour of the Community. No one worries about sovereignty here. Modern Italy
has always been in hock to someone - if it wasn't the Vatican, then it was
the Americans. Why not Brussels?'
Nevertheless, in a prosperous town like Sarzana few realise the practical
implications of closer EC integration. For instance, Franco is working at a
petrol station owned by the state concern, Agip, which is about to be
privatised. He has not heard of competition policy and does not know the
intricate defence mechanisms adopted until now by Agip to keep foreign
competition out of the Italian market.
He realises, however, that self-service pumps, resisted by his union, are in
use in northern Europe and his job could be at risk.
'But Italy gives good pensions,' he says (thanks to a public-sector deficit
which Brussels tells Rome ever more bluntly it cannot afford).
Perhaps if European integration were explained in terms of a game of
football, where the fans no longer had the chance of intimidating the
referee, more Italians would question the benign view of Brussels.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Bastion of British culture wary
of a bouncer from Brussels bureaucrats - Coulsdon, England
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is plenty of indifference to Europe on the shopping streets of
Coulsdon, a community nestling on the green edge of London's southern
sprawl. This is tempered by a fair amount of benign Euro-mindedness.
It must be remembered, though, that Coulsdon is a bastion of British
culture. It is the place where the world's first proper game of cricket was
recorded in 1766. So it is hardly surprising that, on Saturday, the main
emotion expressed towards Brussels was suspicion tinged with stubbornness.
A united Europe would encroach on some cherished elements of British daily
life which Coulsdoners are certainly not ready to give up.
'The Danish referendum is indicative of what the man in the street is
thinking,' declares Mr Colin Moore, a clerical officer from British Telecom.
'There's a general feeling that Jacques Delors wants to be king of Europe.'
Mr Moore does not want the Community, for example, to meddle with the
content of British sausages. Warming to his theme he outlines other
treasured traditions under threat. 'We in this country are used to certain
things, like milk being delivered to the door. To sweep all this away
because others don't have it is wrong.'
Representing Coulsdon's indifferent tendency, by contrast, is the robust
manageress in Coughlans Patisserie. Reluctantly she undergoes an FT
interrogation while executing a strategically-placed order to sell four
juicy Danish pastries.
No, she does not have time to think about the Maastricht treaty, she frowns.
No, she has not done a record trade in unloading Danish pastries this week
to Coulsdon customers celebrating the Danes' feat in leaving the Community
sticky-fingered. No, she glares, she does not particularly like them
herself.
Mr Martyn James, who runs a busy butcher's shop, is more forthcoming. He is
more positive, too. He scoffs at Mr Moore's suggestion that Brussels would
interfere with his sausage trade. 'Ten years ago they said Brussels would
stop us selling fresh turkey. Nothing happened.'
Mr James says Yes to Europe. 'It's better to be united.' He gazes at his
wares - leek sausages, Chinese-style chicken wings, marinated lamb  - and
senses that the forces of internationalism are marching in the right
direction.
'We didn't sell all this before,' he says contentedly.
Another man who believes that 'a united Europe is essential' is Mr Robert
Cook, an elderly ex-army officer who met his German wife while in occupied
Germany after the Second World War. They are stocking up supplies after
spending three weeks near Hanover visiting relatives. Nonetheless, he adds:
'I can understand why people are a bit wary.'
Wariness springs from most Coulsdon lips. Mrs Pat Burcher, serving in a
stationer's shop, spots a creeping but ill-defined menace from Brussels. She
would love to say No in a British referendum. 'They will take away our
individuality. I don't want to be moulded into one.' What does she most fear
from Brussels? 'They're already laying down the law, aren't they,' she
replies. In what areas? 'You know, silly little things,' she replies.
Mr Kevin Wood, headmaster of a local school, says the Danish result is 'very
encouraging'. He explained it all at the school assembly on Wednesday,
recalling to the children how Sir Thomas More also declined to say Yes
(although this was to Henry VIII over a royal divorce, of all things, and
not to a Delors edict on sausages). Mr Wood stood for Labour in
Leicestershire on an anti-EC ticket in the 1970 election, lost by 17,000
votes, but now feels the satisfaction of late vindication.
Just back from a coach tour of France, Germany, Switzerland and Italy with
Surrey teachers, Mr Wood backs links with Europe, but does not want full
integration. 'The Danish vote tells me there is a groundswell of anti-common
market feeling.'
Mrs Joan Fazackerley pauses while guiding two small children down the
street. 'I'm in favour of being in Europe, but not of losing our
independence. I'm not in favour of one currency.' She would say No to
Maastricht in a British referendum.
Mr George Stewart, the joint proprietor of a gun shop, sees no reason why
Britain should have to give up driving on the left. He, too, has a German
wife and observes with pleasure how many Germans do not want to get rid of
the D-Mark.
Mr Stewart is also concerned about the remoteness of Brussels. 'The line of
communication between the people making the decisions and the man in the
street is so tenuous as to be invisible.'
Coulsdon clearly believes in town planning. Handily placed next door to the
gun shop is the parlour of W A Truelove, funeral directors. Just the place
for a last judgment on Maastricht.
Mrs Anne Lock, the manageress, says: 'I tend to agree with the Danes.
They've stood out where others have been afraid to. I don't think we should
be ruled by Brussels. No other country can tell us how to run things. We've
always been an independent little island, haven't we?'

FT  08 JUN 92 / G7 tries to end US isolation at Rio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Group of Seven industrialised countries is trying to end the isolation
of the US at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro to raise the conference's
chances of success as it moves into its final week.
In particular, the G7 will be pushing for a strong agreement on forest
conservation, the one area in which the US has expressed interest, and is
willing to propose financial support.
However, President George Bush made clear after talks yesterday with Mr John
Major that he would not sign a treaty to protect the 'biological diversity'
of the planet's plant and animal life. 'We don't have an open pocketbook . .
. the financial parts are too open-ended for us,' Mr Bush said.
Britain is expected to sign the treaty but Mr Major, during the talks at the
president's Camp David weekend retreat, apparently made little attempt to
persuade Mr Bush to change his mind. Mr Major said the treaty seemed to call
for 'very substantial commitments without commitments as to how and where
the money will be used'. He thought, however, it would be possible to solve
these problems.
The US position has been complicated by the leak of a memorandum from Mr
William Reilly, the administrator of the country's Environmental Protection
Agency and its chief delegate in Rio, seeking to win Mr Bush's approval for
a modified version of the treaty.
Mr Bush said the leak was 'unhelpful' and 'insidious'. If its author were
discovered, he would soon be 'gainfully unemployed'. The president will be
among the more than 100 world leaders converging on Rio at the end of the
week for the formal summit. But the US has a lot of work to do in the four
days before Mr Bush arrives if he is not to be met by angry crowds of
environmentalists.
Washington's refusal to sign the bio-diversity treaty, and the doubts it has
expressed about other documents have cast a shadow over the proceedings.
They have angered delegates and because the agreements negotiated in Rio
will need US financial and political backing if they are to succeed.
The developing countries have been pressing for large amounts of aid, but
the industrial countries want any new commitments to be tightly controlled.
Mr Reilly confirmed yesterday that the US had still not decided whether to
sign the Rio Declaration, the summit document to which all world leaders are
supposed to put their names at a round table ceremony on Saturday. Some US
officials admitted that a US refusal to sign would provoke an outrage.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Slovak nationalist poll win raises fear of split

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR VACLAV Havel, the Czechoslovak president, last night called on Mr Vaclav
Klaus, the federal finance minister, to try to form a new federal government
following Mr Klaus's right-wing Civic Democratic party's strong showing in
the weekend general elections.
But he will face strong opposition from Slovak nationalists led by Mr
Vladimir Meciar, whose Movement for a Democratic Slovakia won a clear
victory in Slovakia, fuelling fears that Czechoslovakia will split.
Mr Meciar instantly withdrew his support for Mr Havel's presidential
candidacy and repeated his pledge to push a Slovak constitution through the
Slovak parliament. This would violate the federal constitution drawn up in
1968 by the communists.
The strong support for nationalist and left-wing parties in Slovakia is
reflected in the federal parliament, where they will be able to form
alliances with Czech opposition groups to block attempts by Mr Klaus to form
a new coalition federal government or push through constitutional reforms.
But the Slovak nationalists are also internally divided into different
factions, with several ready to stop short of an outright break-up of the
federation and anxious to continue economic reforms, albeit at a slower
pace.
The Civic Democratic Party obtained 29.7 per cent of the vote for the Czech
parliament, where Mr Klaus will be able to form a majority coalition,
enabling it to accelerate market reform. He won 34 per cent of the vote for
the federal parliament.
The Czech right-wing parties won a convincing victory in the Czech
parliament over the left-wing opposition led by the Czech communist party
with 14 per cent of the vote, followed by the Social Democrats with 6.5 per
cent.
The extreme right-wing Republican Party, which appeals to the growing
resentment against gipsies, also managed to surpass the 5 per cent threshold
to gain seats in the Czech parliament.
But right wing parties were heavily defeated in Slovakia where 12 per cent
unemployment has fuelled resentment against radical market reforms which
have hit hardest at the republic's heavy engineering and arms industries.
Mr Meciar's movement, a loose coalition of nationalist forces, won 37.3 per
cent of the vote and is expected to form a majority coalition with the
pro-independence Slovak National Party which obtained 7.9 per cent.
In Slovakia the reformed communist party led by Mr Peter Weiss, gained 14.7
per cent while the Social Democrats led by Mr Alexander Dubcek, leader of
the failed 1968 Prague Spring revolt against communist rule, managed to gain
a handful of seats.
The Christian Democrats of Mr Jan Carnogursky, the former Slovak prime
minister, who replaced Mr Meciar earlier last year, gained only 8.9 per cent
while the attempts of Mr Klaus' party to gain a foothold in Slovakia failed
to surmount the 5 per cent barrier.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Tory rebels to renew push for Maastricht referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TORY MPs opposed to the Maastricht Treaty yesterday said they would keep
pressure on the government as weekend opinion polls showed strong backing
for a UK referendum on closer European union.
Amid clear differences among Conservatives, including in the Cabinet, Mr
Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, will try to soothe the row at Westminster
today when he reports to MPs on last week's emergency discussions by
European Community leaders.
Euro-sceptics will take heart at a hint from Mr Gerald Kaufman, Labour's
foreign affairs spokesman, that the opposition might support a UK
referendum.
'If we had a clear treaty which the country knew was going forward, then one
could not necessarily argue that there should never at any time be a
different way of getting popular approval,' Mr Kaufman said on BBC radio.
Tory backbenchers organising opposition to Maastricht are expected to cause
further embarrassment to the government by collecting signatures for a
motion opposing the reappointment of Mr Jacques Delors as European
Commission president.
The rebels have put forward amendments to the Maastricht bill calling for a
referendum. They have been encouraged by a Sunday Times-Mori poll showing 75
per cent in support of such a move. A Gallup poll for the Sunday Telegraph
showed 69 per cent backing a referendum.
'We are not going to cool off,' Mr Michael Spicer, Tory MP for
Worcestershire South, said.
Lord (formerly Mr Norman) Tebbit, former Cabinet minister, joined calls for
a referendum, saying Maastricht was about 'whether we should give away our
power to govern ourselves'.
The Maastricht bill's passage through parliament has been postponed until at
least the end of this month, following last week's Danish rejection of the
Maastricht treaty. Labour now plans to vote against the bill if the
government brings it back to the Commons without clearing the confusion
created by the Danish referendum result.
Privately some Tories warned at the weekend that ministerial resignations
could follow if the government attempted to bring the Maastricht treaty back
to the Commons in its present form.
'If resignation, as a means of giving leadership to others who needed to be
encouraged, was necessary, I have no doubt that some people would be
prepared to make that gamble,' said one minister.
Financial markets are hoping for a more settled week after the referendum
last week hit shares and bonds while boosting the D-Mark.
Markets were already relatively calm by the end of last week as analysts
concluded that, even if Maastricht might be dead, institutions like the
European Monetary System were more or less intact.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Boost for Maxwell pensioners: Up to Pounds 5m aid planned by
government as DTI considers investigation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEMPORARY financial help, worth up to Pounds 5m, for those pensioners worst
hit by the raiding of pension funds belonging to Maxwell companies will be
announced by the government today.
As Mr Peter Lilley, social security secretary, prepares to unveil a lifeline
for some Maxwell pensioners, plus an independent review of UK pension law,
it has emerged that the Department of Trade and Industry is considering its
own investigation into the affair.
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, may appoint inspectors
to look for possible breaches of company law in areas of the Maxwell empire
not already subject to inquiries by the Serious Fraud Office.
The government's announcement of financial help coincides with a large-scale
lobby by Maxwell pensioners at Westminster today. Early indications were
that the cash would help calm the political protests that have grown since
the discovery that more than Pounds 400m was missing from pension funds of
companies controlled by the late Robert Maxwell.
'This 'drip feed' is what we were pressing them to do,' said Mr Frank Field,
the Labour MP for Birkenhead who has helped to co-ordinate the pensioners'
campaign.
Mr Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, said the
package 'is no way going to meet the requirements of the 32,000 pension
scheme members who have been plundered'.
The announcement is an acknowledgment by the government of a responsibility
to the Maxwell pensioners. However, Mr Lilley will stress that the cash
injection will be strictly limited, probably lasting less than a year.
That may allow time for the completion of an investigation by the Investment
Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro), but the government will not make
any pledges of further help.
Mr Lilley will argue that there is a moral obligation on banks holding the
pension funds' assets - about Pounds 200m is understood to have been
identified so far - to repay the sums, in spite of bankers' claims that
payments were received in good faith.
He hopes that some, if not all, of the funds provided by the social security
department, in agreement with the Treasury, will be recouped.
It remains unclear how many pensioners will benefit immediately from the
cash. Initially it will be targeted at pensioners whose pensions have been
stopped, such as the 240 covered by the Headington Pension Plan, or reduced,
such as the 5,000 under the MCC works scheme.
There was no indication yesterday that the government was prepared to help
towards the legal costs of the Maxwell pensioners. Labour is to press for
the implementation of legislation which would make pensioners creditors of
pension funds, increasing their rights for compensation.
Amid a welter of government inquiries into Maxwell companies, an
inter-departmental committee has been set up to co-ordinate efforts to trace
cash missing from pension funds.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Monday Interview: Advocate of evolving intervention -
Dominique Strauss-Kahn, the French industry minister, talks to William
Dawkins, Andrew Gowers and Ian Davidson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS, ANDREW GOWERS and IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Dominique Strauss-Kahn, France's forceful young industry minister, has
little time for free-marketeers who lambast the French government for
propping up state-owned industries.
'My personal conviction is that we are living in the last part of the
ultra-liberal phase which began in California in the mid-1970s,' says Mr
Strauss-Kahn, 43, who emerged from relative obscurity a year ago to become
French industry and foreign trade minister and one of Europe's most
articulate advocates of an active industry policy.
'If the 1980s were dominated by financial questions and financial
regulations, the 1990s will be the time for states to intervene in industry
in the same way as they do in finance, as regulators - but not just as
regulators, as co-ordinators as well,' he says.
Whether you agree with Mr Strauss-Kahn or not - and plenty of private sector
financiers and industrialists in France do not - his views are worth
listening to. If the Maastricht Treaty on monetary and political union were
implemented by EC member states, the European Community would have the legal
power, for the first time, to seek to improve industry's competitiveness.
Even if last week's Danish vote has thrown the process into turmoil, Mr
Strauss-Kahn will be pushing industrial policy hard, both at home and in the
EC, in the years ahead.
Mr Strauss-Kahn is a typical member of the highly educated elite that runs
France, both in and beyond government. Trained as a lawyer, the former
university economics professor was chairman of the parliament's economics
commission before becoming industry minister. Fond of good food and skiing,
he is married to Ms Anne Sinclair, one of France's best-known female
television interviewers.
Since his appointment in spring 1991 by the former prime minister, the
industrially interventionist Mrs Edith Cresson, Mr Strauss-Kahn has been
unusually prominent for a French industry minister - traditionally a
low-profile job. In the past, industry strategy tended to be set by the
prime minister and finance minster: Mr Roger Fauroux, his predecessor, once
said he saw his job as being like the chief executive of a diversified
holding company. By contrast, Mr Strauss-Kahn is one of the thinkers behind
the controversial plan to reorganise the French state electronics industry
to create an electronics-to-nuclear-energy group, an example of what he
means by 'co-ordination'.
That plan, for a merger of Thomson Consumer Electronics (TCE), the
loss-making manufacturer of audiovisual equipment and home appliances, and
CEA-Industry, a nuclear fuel and reactor group, sparked off a debate in
France over how far interventionism should be allowed to go. The project has
since been scaled down by Mrs Cresson's successor, Mr Pierre Beregovoy. Now
the nuclear energy group is expected to take a minority stake in TCE.
Yet the fact that Mr Strauss-Kahn kept his job at all under the new prime
minister in the April government reshuffle underlines how important
industrial strategy remains in France, even after the relative retreat of
state interventionism. 'Why should the state be more passive than a private
shareholder? It can manage well or badly, but it is not being
interventionist in itself to try to manage one's assets as efficiently as
possible,' says Mr Strauss-Kahn.
The minister has no patience with criticisms of the logic behind the
proposed link between a maker of washing machines and a nuclear research
body. Mr Strauss-Kahn, highlighting two controversial private sector
link-ups, says: 'Look at Siemens and Nixdorf, or the alliance between Volvo
and Procordia. They might be good choices or bad ones, but nobody questions
that they are legitimate.'
At the same time, he is pragmatic over how far the state should wield
influence. He openly admits that state ownership is a second-best solution
for companies unable to flourish under private ownership. 'I say 'yes' to
state ownership not as a matter of principle, but because it is appropriate
for a country like France with its history, culture and state of
development. Once you have said 'yes' to this question, the behaviour of the
state must be that of a shareholder who is as wise as possible, acting in
the interests of those who have accorded it power, in this case the whole of
the French people,' he explains.
State funding, by contrast, is vital for projects that are too long term or
risky for private companies to handle on their own, such as making the next
generation of semiconductors, he argues. In this respect, he believes that
the EC gives too much power to its competition authorities, with their
repeated attacks on state aid, and has an inadequately developed industrial
policy.
Sir Leon Brittan, the EC competition commissioner, who has frequent run-ins
over state aid and merger policy with the French government, 'is right in
theory', says Mr Strauss-Kahn, with barely disguised condescension. 'But
real life is far from the theoretical world in which we would like to live,'
he says. In real life, he adds, market forces are imperfect: today's
sophisticated industrial products tend to emerge more as a result of costly
research and development, than in response to consumer demand.
'We cannot take our cue from the markets alone for very long-term or risky
decisions.' Governments that have lent a helping hand to emerging industries
have gained a competitive edge over governments that have left technology
development to the mercy of market forces, he argues.
Certainly, it is harder to decide just where governments have a duty to
intervene. 'There are no absolute rules to determine what is a strategic
industry . . . What is strategic or not, or what requires intervention or
not, does evolve,' says Mr Strauss-Kahn.
Of course, it is up to the government to decide what is strategic. Broadly,
he sees three kinds of business in which governments can legitimately act as
guardians of national interests: defence; sectors where technological
independence should be guaranteed; and vital supplies such as oil and
nuclear energy.
On oil, Mr Strauss-Kahn sees no ideological difference between the French
state's desire to wield some control over its oil companies and the way in
which the US or Saudi governments defend the interest of their own oil
producers. This explains why, for example, the French government is happy to
reduce its direct stake in Total, the oil group, to a mere 5 per cent, but
will still keep the right to nominate the chairman and vet its international
agreements.
There is no doubt that the frontiers of strategic industry are on the move,
as shown by the government's programme of partial privatisations, in which
it is prepared to sell up to 49 per cent of state-controlled companies.
Revealingly, Mr Strauss-Kahn's thumbnail definition of today's strategic
sectors does not apply to huge chunks of current French state industry such
as cars, steel, insurance and banking. But he is not naive enough to
broadcast in advance which privatisations will follow the partial sales that
have already been made at Elf, Total's larger state-controlled rival, and at
Credit Local de France, a local authority bank.
Yet the case of Renault, the symbol of French industrial policy, does
illustrate his general strategy. Here Mr Strauss-Kahn favours the
state-owned carmaker's alliance with Volvo, the Swedish car group, because
the basic business of carmaking can no longer be said to be strategic. But
that does not mean that the government has completely lost interest.
Instead, its interest has become more selective, shifting from basic
manufacturing to electronic components, for example, he says.
The overall impression is of a pragmatic, sometimes opportunistic approach
to industrial issues. Successful or not, the image of French industry policy
embodied by the eloquent Mr Strauss-Kahn is very different from that of 10
years ago. The aim used to be to keep inefficient manufacturers alive;
today, Mr Strauss-Kahn sees his job as nudging the public sector into a
high-technology world, in competitive shape.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Michael Prowse on America: Oregon blazes an electronic trail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Atop the Art Deco Capitol building in Salem, Oregon, a golden statue of a
rugged settler symbolises the state's pioneering spirit. The old frontier is
closed, but the state's leaders are still finding new trails to blaze.
The hottest idea in American politics is Mr Ross Perot's proposed
'electronic townhall'. The Texas billionaire and likely presidential
candidate believes the US can solve its economic and social problems only if
politicians use electronic technology to consult regularly with the people.
Barbara Roberts, the governor of Oregon, has already conducted just such an
exercise, known as 'The Conversation'.
When Oregonians elected Ms Roberts, a liberal Democrat, to the governorship
18 months ago, they simultaneously passed Measure 5, a tax initiative that
sharply cut local property taxes and shifted responsibility for financing
education to the state government. Ms Roberts had ambitious plans for
improving state services, but was faced with a prospective budget deficit in
the biennium beginning next year of about Dollars 1bn, or nearly 20 per cent
of revenue. She says she undertook state-wide electronic consultations for
two reasons. She sensed unprecedented voter unease. 'People felt left out .
. . we needed to build trust.' At the same time, she believed public
opposition to taxes reflected a lack of understanding of the issues. 'I felt
if they had my information, they would reach my conclusions.'
The Conversation took place last winter and worked as follows. On a given
evening, 20-30 small groups of citizens were assembled at different
locations across the state. They were in two-way audio contact with each
other and with the governor. There was also a one-way video link: all the
groups could see the governor but she could not see them. Ms Roberts would
raise an issue. The groups would discuss it. Then each group would be asked
to outline its conclusions. At the end of the process, the participants
filled out a detailed questionnaire.
Through such electronic meetings, the governor was able to consult directly
with 10,000 Oregonians. She stresses that participants were randomly
selected from voter registration lists, thus forestalling one of the
objections to Mr Perot's plans - that political activists might dominate
electronic meetings. She says the exercise was far more effective than
ordinary polling because participants had to think about the issues rather
than merely offer an instant, uninformed judgment.
The governor claims The Conversation reached a clear conclusion. The people
voiced willingness to pay for essential services, but only if the state
government first demonstrated greater efficiency. To fulfil her side of the
compact, Ms Roberts is enthusiastically streamlining the public sector. She
has announced that some 4,000 state jobs (about 10 per cent of the total)
will disappear and plans to close dozens of state boards and commissions.
But improvements in efficiency can reduce spending by at most Dollars 200m,
about a fifth of the savings needed to balance the books. She has thus just
embarked on stage two of her programme, which is to seek support for a
radical restructuring of taxes to make up the remaining revenue.
Many Oregonians are dubious about the benefits of The Conversation: the
governor recently survived a drive to 'recall' her - in other words, turf
her out early. Ms Ellen Lowe, a church leader and advocate for the poor,
sympathises with the governor's aims but says the electronic meetings failed
to discuss the main issue, which is the need to bring Oregon into line with
other states by introducing a sales tax. Instead, they degenerated into an
exercise in bashing government.
Mr Bill Wyatt, president of the Oregon Business Council, which represents
chief executives, says Ms Roberts has not persuaded most business leaders of
the need for higher taxes. But he claims The Conversation was an
'outstanding idea' which was less effective than it might have been because
of lack of resources. He contrasts her unconventional approach favourably
with that of Governor Lowell Weicker in Connecticut. Facing a similar fiscal
crisis, Mr Weicker forced through legislation for an income tax by 'putting
a gun to the head of the legislature'. The public reaction was an explosion
of rage.
Mr Wyatt believes electronic conversations that try to educate voters while
providing direct feedback for politicians represent the future of American
politics. 'The technology is there. The question is only the role that it
will play.'
Is it a coincidence that the first large-scale attempt to consult
electronically with the people was conducted by a woman? Governor Roberts,
whose trim appearance and no-nonsense style remind one of the younger
Margaret Thatcher, says not. 'I think women lead differently. They are
consensus builders. They don't need to find scalps.'
With a female governor, and with women instrumental in pushing through
radical reforms of both health care and education, Oregon is at the
forefront of another national trend: a drive by women to play a bigger role
in state and national politics. The combination of female politicians and
electronic townhalls could prove potent. You never know, President George
Bush's hopes for a 'kinder, gentler America' might even be realised.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Ian Davidson on Europe: End of the single gospel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When the Danes voted against Maastricht last week, the other 11 member
governments sternly declared that there could be no question of
renegotiating the treaty. They would, wouldn't they? After so much sweat,
the natural reflex is to put the frighteners on the Danes, and hope they
change their minds later this year. If the 11 once open the door to
renegotiation, the treaty would unravel faster than Penelope's knitting.
In a situation of profound disarray, this is a reasonable improvisation:
doing nothing looks like standing firm, it is an easy basis for unanimity,
and it seems to gain time. But if the Danish people do not change their
minds, it is the 11 who will have to think again.
Some quick minds in the Community circuit have already started to think
again, and are touting various power plays to force through the
implementation of the Maastricht Treaty, regardless of the Danish verdict.
One such scheme is to drive the Danes out of the European Community: if they
do not want the new Europe, they should at least allow the rest to get on
with it. Alternatively, the 11 should denounce the Community's existing
Treaty of Rome, and set up house next door in a brand new structure which
just happens to be the Treaty of Maastricht.
I do not know if these muscular fantasies are seriously meant, but they will
not do. There is no legal basis for driving the Danes out of the Community,
nor for denouncing the Treaty of Rome. Even if the Danes could be bounced
into withdrawing, that would be a fearful omen for the new Europe, whose
central characteristic is that it is based on democracy and the rule of law,
not on ruthless intimidation by a gang of toughs. This would not be the kind
of Community any civilised country should want to join. If the Danes, why
not the Greeks? They are far more deserving of eviction. If it comes to
that, why not the British?
If the Danes do not quickly change their minds, the stand-pat position
announced last week in Oslo will lose all plausibility. For a few months,
perhaps, the French can push ahead with the revision of their constitution,
as if nothing untoward had occurred; but they will be running a fearful risk
if they then call a popular referendum to ratify a treaty whose legal
credibility is holed below the water line.
And yet: the 11 did not let the British prime minister, John Major, prevent
them from fixing the target of a single currency, nor from adopting a social
charter. The very idea that Danish voters should totally block the rest of
the Community from moving to a new phase in the integration of Europe is
clearly inadmissible.
The problem is that the Maastricht Treaty is not a self-standing agreement,
but a far-reaching modification of the Rome Treaty. Here is the crux of the
dilemma: is Maastricht a seamless gospel, perfect in all its parts, which
cannot be touched without destabilising the whole structure; or does it
contain discrete nuggets which can be dug out and encrusted in one or more
new Communities?
It is easy to see why the 11 refuse to appease the Danes in a renegotiation
of the terms of the Treaty of Maastricht: they would all then have to
renegotiate the treaty to appease their own anti-marketeers as well. The
attack would be led by the Germans; and before you could say Jacques Delors,
the Treaty of Maastricht would have disappeared in a cloud of smoke.
But a strategy of disaggregation of the treaty need not involve any
substantive renegotiation. All the provisions dealing with economic and
monetary union could be stripped out and incorporated in a self-standing
treaty; there could be another treaty for foreign policy, security and
defence; there would be a social charter; and each of these new Communities
might have different memberships.
This was the way of the world before the Community came along: Gatt was for
trade, IMF was for balance of payments, OECD was for the rich, Nato was for
the west. In the past, orthodox Community dogma was that all members must be
full members of everything. The central question facing the Community in the
wake of the Danish referendum, is this: does the old orthodoxy of a unitary
Community become more compelling in the projected new phase of more intense
integration? Or does it, on the contrary, become less compelling because not
all members are willing or able to keep in step, and because many new
countries want to join?
Not even The Economist could produce a sweeping one-word answer to this
dilemma; it all depends on what kind of Community you want, and how far you
want to go. Some, like Peter Ludlow of the Centre for European Policy
Studies in Brussels, see the Maastricht Treaty as an integral whole, managed
by a single institutional framework. But others believe the Community must
become multi-speed, with an inner political core, because 20 or 30 members
will stop it dead. Manifestly, there would be no point in a foreign and
security policy to which the Irish, Swiss, Austrians, Swedes and Finns could
subscribe; or the Danes, for that matter.

FT  08 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Sweeping change forces traders to
adjust tactics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE aftermath of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty, bond
traders are rapidly adjusting trading techniques and valuation methods, in
order to adapt to a changed environment, in which the theme of convergence
is no longer relevant.
The most common convergence trade has been a bet that the spread between one
of the high-yielding markets, such as Italy, Spain and Portugal, will narrow
relative to a low-yielding markets, such as Germany. Last week many of these
positions were unwound and in some cases reversed.
In a convergence trade, the view that the spread between Italian bond and
bund yields is set to narrow is expressed by selling bunds (or bund futures)
and buying Italian bonds. The opposite view is a divergence trade, which
involves buying bunds and selling Italian bonds.
In the options market, implied volatility - which pushes up the price - has
risen as a result of last week's turbulent conditions, but dealers say that
options still offer reasonable value, considering the increased levels of
risk now present in the market.
There has been buying interest in options offering protection against
further weakness in the Italian bond and currency markets. For example,
dealers reported buying of put options on the Italian lira, which can be
exercised if the lira falls below the bottom of its range in the exchange
rate mechanism.
In the Ecu bond market, investors are no longer prepared to pay a
substantial premium to theoretical yields on expectations of benefits from
monetary union.
Ecu bonds may have further to fall, as traders revalue their Ecu bond
holdings in the wake of last week's turmoil, with greater attention to the
theoretical yield models based on the value of the component markets.
'The theoretical yield curve is one aspect of how the Ecu market is traded,
just as purchasing power parity is taken into account in the foreign
exchange market,' said Mr Jim O'Neill, international economist at Swiss Bank
Corporation. 'But if European monetary union is derailed, the market will go
through the theoretic yield curve.'
Real yields have already tightened to 10 basis points below theoretical
yields, and Mr O'Neill predicts that real yields will soon offer a premium
of around 15 basis points.
With prospects for supply in the sector dwindling, investors will demand a
liquidity premium for buying Ecu bonds, as well as a premium for economic
and political risk.
FOR MANY international fund managers, the past week has been a nightmare.
Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty caused pandemonium in the
European bond markets, writes Sara Webb.
The uncertainty which hangs over some of the European bond markets is
forcing many fund managers to reassess their investment strategy. Some are
considering reducing their European exposure in favour of US, Canadian and
Australian dollar investments.
The Danish vote means the prospects for the convergence of bond yields have
diminished. Whereas during much of 1991 investors piled into high-yielding
European bond markets, such as Spain and Italy, in the hope of gaining from
converging interest rates, they will now have to be more discerning about
the European bond markets.
Mr Nick Henderson, head of fixed income at Gartmore says: 'Post-Maastricht,
there is a greater need to differentiate between the markets. Convergence
towards German bond yields will still occur in those countries where the
economic fundamentals justify it, but we will have to be more careful about
those markets where it was just a convergence play.'
Spain, Italy and the Ecu bond markets will continue to suffer. These markets
were the worst hit last week as dealers switched into D-Mark and guilder
assets, and the high-yielding markets are likely to drop further.
'We're advising clients to sell Italian, Spanish, Swedish and Ecu bonds
because we think yields will rise further in the near-term, but then we
could see a good buying opportunity for these markets after a few weeks,'
says Mr William Ledward, European economist at Nomura International.
Although there was a burst of activity in the bond markets last week, some
fund managers are still assessing their investment strategy.
'Most of the transactions haven't happened yet. Fund managers haven't taken
their decisions yet - in situations like this, fund managers often just sit
on their hands,' says Mr Steven Bell, economic adviser to Deutsche Bank's
gilts operations.

FT  08 JUN 92 / UK Gilts: Dealers shrug off Maastricht factors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICES of gilt-edged securities slipped by up to 1 point as investors
weighed up the implications that European monetary union may not happen
after all.
But the shock waves sent through Europe by the referendum in Denmark may end
up having only a relatively small impact on the outlook for gilts. By Friday
night, many gilt practitioners were considering the outlook for the
securities with reference to factors other than the terms as set out in the
Maastricht treaty for Emu. These plans have now been relegated to history.
The gilt specialists were coming round to the conclusion that Maastricht had
 -in reality - had only a minor impact on the performance of the gilt market
over the past six months.
'Even before the referendum, many people thought Emu in some shape or form
had only a 50 per cent chance of coming off; after all, there were so many
things that could have gone wrong,' said one gilts observer. 'After the
Danes' decision, the probability has been pushed down to, say, 20 per cent.
The change has been in terms of nuance rather than a complete re-think about
how the market is operating.'
This interpretation was supported by the modest change in the yield
difference between gilts and lower-yielding German bonds during last week.
On Monday, 10-year gilt yields were 124 basis points (1.24 percentage
points) higher than the yields of equivalent German bonds. This illustrated
the scepticism on the part of many investors that union was on course to
take place by the end of the century.
Had their confidence about union been higher, the yield spread would have
been much lower, indicating the perception that inflation and interest rates
in the two countries were on course for convergence.
On Friday night, after the Danish decision led to investors switching out of
UK securities but left German bonds little changed, the yield difference was
slightly higher at 137 basis points. It looks over the next few weeks that
the yield difference may edge up still more, as investors rethink their
strategies over economic convergence. Theories held by some economists a
week ago that the yield difference might come down to only 100 basis points
by the end of the year are no longer in circulation.
Even so, the extent of last week's gilt sell-off has to be considered in the
context of the steady increase in gilt prices since the Tories' election win
on April 9. Prices are still much higher than on election day, with yields
correspondingly lower. In the 10-year area, gilts are now yielding about 9.1
per cent, compared with about 9.8 per cent on the day of the poll.
All this supports the thesis that many investors reckon the trend in Britain
towards lower inflation and interest rates - factors generally perceived as
being helpful to gilts - should continue with or without Emu.
That appears to be the view of the Bank of England, which on Friday
signalled a 'business as usual' approach by announcing an auction on June 24
of an expected Pounds 2bn or so of bonds maturing between 2007 and 2012.
Details of the specific stock and the amount to be auctioned are to be
announced on June 16. Plans for the auction were well received in the market
 -the type of stock is expected to be fairly easy to sell - and prices edged
up.
The auction announcement came after the Bank sold about Pounds 400m of 9 per
cent conversion stock due 2000 that had been available to the market for
over a week. It had been the residue of an Pounds 800m tranche of bonds
announced on May 22. During the week the Bank also gave details of gilt
sales in April - when demand for the securities was exceptionally strong.
Net gilt sales (taking into account redemptions) during the month were about
Pounds 4.4bn, of which Pounds 3.1bn were sold to UK non-bank investors and
Pounds 464m overseas.

FT  08 JUN 92 / US Money and Credit: Jobs data bring muted response
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Treasury bond market offered only a muted response on Friday to
worse-than-expected jobs data for May.
The US unemployment rate in May rose from 7.2 per cent to 7.5 per cent, its
highest level since 1984. But the jittery market, uncertain about the path
of US monetary policy, did not stage the kind of rally that would normally
be expected.
Instead it managed to mark the price of the benchmark 30-year Treasury bond
less than  1/2 point higher, to yield 7.84 per cent.
The lack of enthusiasm for data that would normally stir traders to chalk
bond prices higher - in the hope that more stimulation of the economy may be
needed - was widely perceived as a signal that many investors have now given
up hope of a further easing of interest rates by the Federal Reserve in the
near future.
The latest data are likely to have far more of an impact on the political
arena, where opponents of President Bush should benefit from the lacklustre
economic outlook. The May figures showed that 68,000 non-farm payroll jobs
were added, but this was well below the expected 125,000 increase. In
manufacturing, the number of jobs declined by 10,000.
According to Ms Maria Ramirez, the bond market analyst, traders were too
discouraged by recent reports that the Fed's policy was on hold 'to price in
a Fed easing'. Ms Cheryl Katz, economist at Lehman Brothers, the New York
investment bank, noted the jobs data was 'definitely not weak enough for a
Fed easing'.
With the long end of the Treasury market trading in a narrow yield range of
7.5 per cent to 8.0 per cent, Ms Ramirez reckons that those economists who
have been divining a 'traditional' post-war recovery are simply wrong.
Rather, she notes that the US economy is experiencing structural problems
that will take years, not months, to resolve. Among these are the oversupply
of property in the US commercial real estate market, the bad debt provisions
banks will have to make as a result of their property loan exposure and the
continuing liquidation of the property portfolio held by the Resolution
Trust Corporation, the US agency that auctions property seized from failed
savings and loans.
Taken together with the May jobs data, this scenario appears to indicate a
fragile US recovery and the prospect of a 1992 economic growth rate closer
to 2 per cent than 3 per cent.
The question facing the Fed, as Salomon Brothers noted on Friday, is whether
a slow and steady firming of the US recovery will be sufficient.
Opinions differ. Mr Philip Braverman, chief economist at DKB Securities,
calls the present economic environment a 'growth recession recovery' and
says it will remain fragile. However, he argues that such a recovery will
eventually force the Fed to ease further, perhaps with a 50-basis point cut
in Federal funds and the discount rate after the next meeting of G7 leaders
in July.
Looking ahead, the new data expected are still unlikely to prove conclusive.
Tomorrow sees the release of consumer credit figures for April, which may
have risen by Dollars 500m. On Thursday, May producer price data should show
a 0.2 per cent increase. Then on Friday consumer price numbers for May
should show a 0.3 per cent rise.

FT  08 JUN 92 / European Bonds: Price slide raises long-term questions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPINION remains split over the significance of the precipitous fall in bond
prices which hit most markets last week, following Danish voters' rejection
of the Maastricht treaty.
Some analysts and fund managers interpreted the shake-out as a fundamental
change of direction. To others, the events of the week were seen as a
temporary, if violent, correction in the longer-term process of European
convergence.
The immediate damage was certainly severe, especially in the high-yielding
European markets which have benefited from heavy in-flows of international
funds.
For example, Italian bond yields at the 10-year maturity rose from 11.04 per
cent at the close on Tuesday, net of withholding tax, to 11.36 per cent by
Friday.
Spanish bond yields at the same maturity stood at 11.26 per cent the end of
the week, up from 10.90 per cent before the result of the Danish referendum
was known.
Bonds denominated in Ecu, the potential single European currency, were
especially hard hit. The French government 10-year Ecu bond, the benchmark
in the sector, closed the week on a yield of 8.91 per cent, from 8.58 per
cent on Tuesday.
About the only area of gain was the German market, which ended higher on the
week - 10-year yields at 7.95 per cent by Friday from 7.97 per cent on
Monday - in spite of falling in sympathy with other markets in the immediate
aftermath of the Danish announcement.
The unresolved question is whether the slide in high-yield European markets
will continue or stabilise. It remains to be seen whether investors will
totally rethink their asset allocations and switch funds into the markets of
the D-Mark block, or out of Europe entirely.
Some switching out of high-yielding bonds had already taken place last month
as concern about the Maastricht ratification process started to gather.
According to JP Morgan's government bond index monitor, Spain and Italy were
among the worst performing bond markets in May - returning only around 0.75
per cent in local currency terms. In the year to the end of April, Spain and
Italy were the second and third best-performing markets, outpaced only by UK
gilts.
Last week, some fund managers were switching funds within Europe. A
favourite strategy was to sell Italian bonds and buy Denmark, which has
sound, low inflation economic fundamentals and looked cheap after
Wednesday's sell-off.
The Danish government bond market was closed for a public holiday on Friday,
but yields had already fallen from the 8.97 per cent peak reached on
Wednesday.
Some other markets appeared to have touched bottom by the end of the week.
The yield spread of French government bonds over Germany remained steady at
75 French government even managed to auction FFr11bn worth of new stock on
Thursday, in spite of the nervous market conditions.
However, the scale of the damage was still substantial. At the close on
Tuesday, before the result of the Danish referendum on Maastricht was known,
the yield spread stood at 53 basis points.
Yet the Italian and Spanish markets continued to fall. Both markets closed
on Friday significantly lower on the day.
One line of argument is that the high-yielding markets will not offer fair
value until yields have risen to the levels seen last summer - when it was
unclear whether the European Community governments would be able to reach
agreement on the text of the Maastricht treaty.
On this view, Italian government bond yields could rise to 11.75 per cent
net. Spanish bond yields could rise to 11.9 per cent.
Contrary to the view of some fund managers last week, Danish bonds might not
stabilise until yields are around 9.25 per cent.
Against this, the fundamentals have improved in some economies this year.
For example, Italian inflation is now running at an annual rate of around
5.7 per cent and falling, having averaged 6.5 per cent last year. So bond
prices could settle some way above the levels before Maastricht was
calculated into the price of high-yielding markets.
To some investors these arguments were clearly secondary. On this view, the
debate over Maastricht is likely to hang over European markets - even those
where the economic fundamentals are good or improving - for some time to
come.
International funds were retreating from European bonds entirely last week,
in favour of the US, Canada and Japan. There was strong buying of Euro-yen
bonds towards the end of the week, for example.

FT  08 JUN 92 / International Company News: Fears on Fokker deal revealed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   AMSTERDAM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GROWING unease in the Netherlands about the proposed sale of a 51 per cent
stake in Fokker, the Dutch aeroplane builder, to Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa)
of Germany was underlined at the weekend by reports that the company's
supervisory board chairman, Mr Frans Swarttouw, had threatened to resign.
In a letter leaked to the press, Mr Swarttouw warned the deal must not lead
to Fokker being downgraded to a simple assembly plant and to the loss of
Dutch high-technology expertise.
The letter, addressed to the company's management board and to the Ministry
of Economic Affairs, which owns 32 per cent of Fokker, also said the company
should be looking for alternative partners to Dasa in case no suitable
agreement could be reached with the German group.
The main outlines of the confidential letter appeared on Saturday morning
just hours before the eight-member supervisory board was scheduled to meet
with the company's chairman, Mr Erik-Jan Nederkoorn. Mr Swarttouw described
the leak as a 'disaster'.
After the meeting, Fokker said the letter had been 'overtaken' by events and
that the entire supervisory board now fully supported the management board.
Nevertheless, the misgivings of Mr Swarttouw, who ran Fokker's management
board for 11 years until 1989, reveal the extent to which the company is
worried about its future as part of a Dasa-led European aeroplane
consortium.
The German group says that it is conducting the negotiations with Fokker on
behalf of its partners in the European 'Regioliner' joint venture -
Aerospatiale of France and Alenia of Italy.
Controversy about the deal was heightened last week after comments in Munich
by Mr Jurgen Schrempp, Dasa's chairman, who seemed to cast doubt on Fokker's
claim that it would be the 'leading partner' in any joint development of
regional aircraft.
Dutch unions and members of parliament are concerned that Fokker might lose
its ability to design and sell its own aircraft if it were taken over by
Dasa, bringing to an end the Netherlands' independent role in international
aviation.
Talks between Fokker and Dasa are scheduled to continue in the Netherlands
tomorrow.

Tokyo trading

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN brokers' share of market volume on the Tokyo Stock Exchange rose
above 20 per cent in April, thanks to their expertise in stock futures and
options trading, and to continuing foreign interest in Japanese equities.
The increase in foreign market share reflects the decline in trading at
Japanese brokerages, which depend on orders from domestic investors. It
could also prompt further criticism of futures and options trading by
foreign brokerages.
Japanese financial authorities have blamed the stock market volatility on
futures and options trading, and have tightened rules and increased
commissions to curb activity.
Of the 124 brokerages registered with the Tokyo Stock Exchange, 25 are
branches of foreign houses.
According to brokers' figures, foreign brokerage houses had accounted for
only 3 per cent of the market in the first half of 1988 fiscal year but this
figure rose to 11 per cent in 1990.
On the other hand, the market share of the Big Four - Nomura Securities,
Daiwa Securities, Nikko Securities and Yamaichi Securities - which accounted
for more than 45 per cent in the first half of 1988, has fallen below the 30
per cent level.

steel prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VOEST Stahl, the Austrian steelmaker, saw operating income halved last year
to Sch624m (Dollars 55.4m) from Sch1.29bn because of weak steel prices and
losses from specialty steel production.
However, Mr Ludwig von Bogdandy, chairman, said he expected a slight
improvement in the 1992 results following restructuring at the steel and
specialty steel divisions.
The steel company is the largest subsidiary of the state-owned holding
concern Austrian Industries (AI), which is faced with massive losses at its
aluminium unit AMAG.
There has been talk that Mr Rudolf Streicher, who last month lost the
election for Austria's presidency against Mr Thomas Klestil, might take over
from Mr von Bogdandy at Voest. Mr Streicher is an experienced industrial
manager.
Voest's 1991 after-tax income dropped only 19 per cent to Sch285m from
Sch350, helped by extraordinary results. Group sales advanced 20 per cent to
Sch55.1bn because of the takeover of the Swedish specialty steel company
Uddeholm and other smaller foreign acquisitions.
Uddeholm has been merged with Voest's troubled specialty steel unit Boehler,
which suffered a loss of Sch1.2bn last year. The combined unit is expected
to swing to profit in 1993.

SA BREWING Holdings may have to modify its plans for a ADollars 6bn
(USDollars 4.61bn) merger with Foster's Brewing Group after receivers and
managers took control of Foster's largest shareholder, International Brewing
Investments (IBI), Reuters reports from Sydney.
Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) last week appointed receivers and managers to
IBI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mr John Elliott's International Brewing
Holdings. IBI's principal asset is a 32 per cent shareholding in Foster's.
Mr Ross Wilson, SA Brewing chief executive, said he expected to have
discussions with BHP next week.
'I think what BHP has done has clearly made the transition of the merger
that much more simpler because, in fact, it's now resolved or partly
resolved the IBH problem,' Wilson said in an interview.
IBH owns 37.75 per cent of Foster's, a stake worth about half its debt of
ADollars 3bn owed to bankers and BHP. The stake was built up when IBH tried
to take over Foster's in 1989.
Under SA Brewing's proposal, SA Brewing shareholders would receive one share
in the newly merged company for every one SA Brewing share held, and
Foster's shareholders would receive one share for every 1.5.

FT  08 JUN 92 / International Company News: Dofasco omits dividend after
posting CDollars 17m loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOFASCO, Canada's biggest steelmaker, has omitted its dividend for the first
time in recent memory.
The loss-making company, which was one of Canada's most profitable and
highly-regarded industrial groups before its ill-fated 1987 acquisition of
Algoma Steel, said that it would not pay the quarterly dividend of 15
Canadian cents, due on July 1.
The dividend stood at 32 cents a share in early 1991.
Dofasco's chief domestic rival, Stelco, suspended its dividend payments a
year ago.
Both companies have been hit hard by the slump in the North American motor
industry and by fierce competition from imports. The steelmakers have
received a modest boost since last November, however, from a decline in the
Canadian dollar.
Dofasco suffered a first-quarter loss of CDollars 17.6m (USDollars 14.7m) on
sales of CDollars 461m.
The company earlier wrote off its entire CDollars 700m investment in Algoma,
which emerged last month from a debt-restructuring with its employees
holding a sizeable equity interest.
Dofasco, which is based in Hamilton, Ontario, plans to cut its workforce by
1,000 jobs by the end of the year through an early retirement package and
the closure of its foundry operations.

FT  08 JUN 92 / International Company News: Banc One to buy Key Centurion
for Dollars 536m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANC ONE, the fast-growing Ohio-based commercial banking group, is to
acquire Key Centurion of West Virginia in a stock deal worth Dollars 536m.
The purchase of the 54-branch bank, which represents Banc One's sixth
acquisition of the year, will bring the group's total assets to Dollars
75bn, more than double their level at the start of last year.
The rapid growth of the bank, which has made a dozen small to medium-sized
acquisitions over the past 18 months, is as striking as its ability to avoid
the large loan write-offs and other difficulties experienced by much of the
US banking industry.
Under the leadership of Mr John McCoy, chairman and chief executive, Banc
One has been concentrating on a conservative lending policy in the retail
banking sector and has maintained a return on assets that is among the
highest in US banking.
Last year Banc One bucked the national trend by turning in a 25 per cent
increase in net profits, to Dollars 529.5m.
After the Centurion deal, which will add Dollars 3bn of assets, Banc One
will control 58 separate banks with more than 1,300 branches in 12 states.
As such the bank is taking advantage of gaps in state banking laws to become
one of the most geographically diversified of US banking groups.
Mr McCoy said in an interview at the weekend that Banc One had made 109
acquisitions since 1967. He stressed the focus on retail-oriented bank
acquisitions that allow Banc One to achieve a leading market share in each
region in which it has expanded.
Although Mr McCoy's management is admired by many, the ambitious expansion
of Banc One, which only two months ago did a Dollars 1.2bn stock deal to
acquire Valley National Bank of Arizona, has drawn criticism from fellow
bankers.
'I think McCoy has done a terrific job of building up Banc One, but I worry
that he may be doing too much,' said the chief executive of a New York bank.
'They have a lot on their plate now. It would not surprise me to see them
developing a hiccough at some point,' commented Mr Dan Martin, a banking
analyst at Standard &amp; Poor's, the rating agency.
Mr McCoy responds to such concerns by stressing his acquisitions have mainly
been of banks with healthy balance sheets and that he has never acquired a
bank more than a third the size of Banc One.
He also notes that unlike most US banks, Banc One has an unusually low
proportion of property lending, which is roughly 13 per cent of the bank's
total loan portfolio, or half the average of many bigger banks.
'Nobody had to call us to ask how much loan exposure we had to Olympia &amp;
York. We are focused on retail banking,' he said.
The Centurion deal is unlikely to cause any problems, according to S&amp;P. This
is because the West Virginia bank is very liquid, with a Dollars 1.4bn loan
portfolio and Dollars 3bn of total assets.
A recent study by Salomon Brothers concluded that despite the speedy growth
in assets, the recent acquisitions are unlikely to cause a 'material
impairment of earnings'.

FT  08 JUN 92 / UK Company News: GPA lifts offer to 85m shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GPA, the world's largest lessor of modern commercial aircraft, has increased
the size of its global share offer from 80m to 85m shares. There has been no
change to the Dollars 10 to Dollars 12.50 (Pounds 5.45 to Pounds 6.80)
indicated range for the issue price. At the Dollars 12.50 price the offer
would raise over Dollars 1bn and value the group at Dollars 3.6bn.
The issue could be increased again by up to 12.75m shares under the
so-called 'green shoe' arrangements, should demand warrant it.
The group, based in the Irish Republic and headed by Mr Tony Ryan, is going
public through a four-part offer with tranches in the UK and Ireland, the
US, Japan and the rest of the world. The prospectus for the UK and Ireland
issue will be published today.
Advisers to the group said that responses to the international presentations
to potential investors had been sufficiently encouraging to increase the
size of the offer. There had also been a higher level of interest shown by
UK and Irish private investors than expected and as a result the prospectus
will be advertised in the press.
Of the extra 5m shares, 3.5m will be additional new shares, taking the
number the company is selling to 59.5m. If the price is set at the top of
the range GPA would receive Dollars 696m, net of expenses, from the sale.
Existing shareholders are selling 25.5m shares after the increase.
The proceeds will go towards financing aircraft purchases. GPA has
commitments to buy Dollars 11.9bn of aircraft by 2000, of which Dollars
7.1bn is due by the end of 1994. It has options to buy another Dollars 9.1bn
by 2000.
The group's banking covenants allow it a maximum debt to equity ratio of
5:1. The ratio is 3:1 before the offer. As well as committed loan
facilities, GPA sells aircraft to help finance purchases. In the last two
financial years these sales have raised Dollars 1.2bn a year.
GPA also taps the international bond markets for funds. It is finalising a
Dollars 522m deal securitising aircraft leases.
The offer period for the UK and Ireland part of the offer is being extended
by one day to June 16. Applicants in this offer can specify a maximum price
they are willing to pay or can agree to buy at whatever price is set. UK
applicants must apply for a minimum of 200 shares, costing at least Pounds
1,090 at the lowest price.
The price will be set on or about June 17, when the decision whether to
increase again will be taken. The price will be announced on June 18 at
12.30pm, with conditional dealings expected at 2.30pm.
That price will form the basis of public offers in the US and Japan and
private placements in continental Europe, Canada and elsewhere. These offers
will close on June 25.

MR WILLIAM Purves, Hongkong and Shanghai Bank's chairman, said yesterday
that he expected Midland Bank shareholders to follow their board's strong
advice and accept his bank's offer for the British clearer now that Lloyds
Bank had withdrawn from the contest.
Hongkong Bank convenes an extraordinary general meeting of its shareholders
tomorrow to approve its Pounds 3.9bn offer for Midland. At that meeting
shareholders would also be asked to withdraw the restriction limiting any
one shareholder from owning more than 1 per cent of the bank.
Mr Purves said that the bid 'seems to be moving in the right direction'. On
Friday, just hours after the department of trade and industry allowed Lloyds
to buy up to 10 per cent of Midland, it had decided to withdraw from the
fray.
'I don't anticipate anyone appearing on the horizon in the next 18 days,' Mr
Purves said in an interview. 'But until the offer is closed and declared
unconditional one can not be certain.'
He said he did not expect that any of Midland's large shareholders would
hold out and not accept the bid.
'If we do not have 50 per cent on the 25th (of June) then the offer is
dead,' he said. 'In that event I would think the Midland share price would
fall back by 100p to 150p. So I think it's unlikely that people would want
to risk that.'
He said that once the offer went unconditional it would be left open for a
period to allow for a mopping up exercise. He said the bank wanted to settle
the transaction in July.
'Once it is unconditional we can sit down with Midland. There is a lot of
work to be done if we are to get the synergies we promise.' The bank
predicts synergies will result in extra profits of Pounds 800m over the
first four years of the merger.
Looking back on the contest for Midland, Mr Purves admitted that there had
been the 'odd distraction' but that it had gone according to plan.
'We planned to go down this route and we did,' he said. 'The only thing we
got slightly wrong was not realising that institutional shareholders of
Midland would not be interested in holding our loan stock. They did not
believe it would trade at par.
'Because of this we revised the offer so there was a cash alternative. We
also revised it because of the planned sale of Thomas Cook. That will add
about Pounds 100m to Midland's profit this year.'
It was Mr Purves and Sir Kit McMahon, former Midland chairman, who conceived
of the marriage between the two banks in the wings of the 1987 International
Monetary Fund conference in Washington. But yesterday Mr Purves declined to
take personal credit for the success.
'This is not a personal thing, it's a corporate thing. The board has been
very supportive and a large team has worked on it.'

FT  08 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome's US boost from Zovirax
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US REVENUES generated by Zovirax, the world's best-selling anti-viral drug
marketed by Wellcome, the UK pharmaceutical group, could be far higher than
analysts' predictions, according to a leading American virologist.
Dr Richard Whitely, Professor of Paediatrics and Clinical Virology at the
University of Alabama, believes Zovirax will be used by as many as 1m
chicken pox patients over the next 12 months and by as many as 3m a year as
early as 1996.
Previous estimates of Zovirax sales for this illness have been far lower. In
a recent note, SG Warburg, the company's brokers, estimated only 20 per cent
of US patients would use the drug by 1994, generating additional revenues of
only Pounds 15m.
Zovirax, which is used mainly to treat herpes and related infections, was
only licensed in the US for chicken pox early this year.
Between 3.4m and 4m US residents catch the disease annually.
Speaking at a virology conference in Berlin, Dr Whitely said he believed
general practitioners would come under intense pressure form Paris to
prescribe Zovirax for children infected with chicken pox.
Public awareness of the drug's benefits were well known, he said. If
administered within 24 hours of the first signs of chicken pox, the drug can
reduce the number of lesions and the severity of the disease.
Dr Whitely added that doctors may well prescribe Zovirax, which cost between
Dollars 30 and Dollars 55 for a five day treatment, for fear of potential
litigation.
Chicken pox can lead to serious complications in a small minority of cases
and the drug may be able to prevent the disease or lessen its severity.
He warned that the drug's high cost and the problems of quick diagnosis
would prevent all patients receiving Zovirax.

NORWEB, the Manchester-based electricity company, is significantly expanding
its retailing activities through the acquisition of 20 Atlantis electrical
superstores from Thorn EMI for Pounds 5m in cash.
The acquisition of the Atlantis stores will double Norweb's retail floor
space to 230,000 sq ft and give it access to retail parks in the north of
England and the Midlands.
Earlier this year, Thorn EMI decided to withdraw from its loss-making
electrical retailing activities, which had lost Pounds 50m over the previous
three years. Thorn said it would convert most of its 450-store Rumbelows
chain to rental outlets and would consider selling its 45-store Atlantis
chain.

FT  08 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Rugby pays Pounds 15.3m for Ward after
unusual administration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WARD GROUP, which makes technically advanced components for the building
industry but ran out of cash to survive the recession, has been bought by
Rugby Group for Pounds 15.3m. Nearly 1,000 jobs will be saved in Britain,
France and Germany.
Ward, based in Sherburn, North Yorkshire, went into administration last
month, but the sale to Rugby was only made possible because two Coopers &amp;
Lybrand partners sent in to run it borrowed Pounds 2m to sell it as a going
concern. Accountants say such a move on the part of the receiver is unusual,
but not without precedent.
Rugby, also in the construction components business, has got Ward cheaply,
since the book value of net assets purchased is Pounds 27.1m. Ward has been
trading on a cash with order basis while a buyer was found.
The purchase will strengthen Rugby's position in the metal products market
and give it Ward's Atlas building system, which supplies complete metal
buildings packages through a network of approved contractors.
Ward also makes structural steel frames, pre-engineered components and steel
cladding systems, as well as owning Abbseal, a glass processor and insulated
glazing manufacturer with modern plant in Leeds and Peterborough.
Ward made Pounds 12.6m on sales of Pounds 175m in 1989, when interest
charges were Pounds 266,000. In 1990, turnover dropped to just under Pounds
173m but profits tumbled to Pounds 8.7m as interest charges rose nearly
eightfold to more than Pounds 2m. Last year's sales crashed to only Pounds
99m and Ward just managed to break even before interest.
However, the soundness of Ward's advanced products in construction markets
convinced Mr Michael Moore and Mr David Waterhouse of Coopers' Leeds office
that they should risk borrowing Pounds 2m to keep it going. The money will
be repaid by the deal and Coopers, which would have shared any losses, will
get a fee.
Ward's creditors agreed to freeze their positions. Mr Moore said all would
now be paid. 'Although it was risk, it was an innovative approach which
worked well,' Mr Moore added.
The sale includes marketing companies for Ward building systems in Germany
and France, as well as Multicom in Colmar, France, a steelwork manufacturer
employing 151 people.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Heron to suspend interest payments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HERON INTERNATIONAL, Mr Gerald Ronson's troubled UK property and finance
company which is seeking to reschedule nearly Pounds 1.2bn of debts, is to
suspend interest payments on a portion of Pounds 700m in bank loans from the
beginning of July.
The company said yesterday: 'We are paying interest now but we have
concluded that it would be inappropriate to pay interest after the end of
the month in those parts of the group in which cashflow is insufficient.'
The action has been taken in consultation with the banks involved in lending
to the most illiquid parts of the group. However, Heron declined to say
which divisions or which banks would be affected.
Heron did not disclose how much of its Pounds 700m bank debt would be
covered by the suspension of interest payments. It will not affect Pounds
450m in bond market debt, also being rescheduled.
Heron was forced to attempt to reschedule up to Pounds 1.15bn of its Pounds
1.45bn debt after its estimated net assets collapsed to Pounds 115m at the
end of March and put it in breach of covenants.
Unaudited accounts for the year to March 31 this year show a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 124m before exceptional items - of which Heron said about Pounds 118m
was in interest payments - compared with a re-stated Pounds 59m loss the
previous year.
More than 80 banks are still digesting a report commissioned by KPMG Peat
Marwick, the accountancy firm, circulated on Friday, which included a Pounds
1bn valuation of the group's worldwide property portfolio. That contrasted
with a valuation in March of Pounds 1.3bn in a report from Price Waterhouse
using other surveying firms.
Heron said the Peat Marwick report confirmed its own recommendation for a
controlled disposal of its investment properties over a number of years.
Heron warned bondholders in April that a 'fire sale' of assets would result
in a shortfall of at least Pounds 550m.
It said yesterday it hoped its re-scheduling would be completed by autumn,
ahead of the next payments to the holders of its Pounds 450m in Eurobonds.
The five banks on the steering committee dealing with Heron are Barclays,
National Westminster, Bank of America, Royal Bank of Canada and Chemical
Bank.

FT  08 JUN 92 / SEBanken makes first loss ever
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   STOCKHOLM
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SKANDINAVISKA Enskilda Banken (SEBanken), Sweden's largest private
commercial bank, has reported an operating loss of around SKr600m (Pounds
57m) after bad debt provisions for the first four months of the year, its
first deficit ever.
The bank said it had decided to make a preliminary statement about its
interim results ahead of their full disclosure tomorrow to counter
speculation about the state of its finances.
The loss follows a jump to SKr2.5bn from an estimated SKr1.6bn in bad debt
provisions. Actual write-offs in the first four months totalled SKr563m.
The bank reported an operating profit of SKr752m for the first four months
of 1991.
There remains little prospect of any early revival, but the bank said its
capital ratio was still above 10 per cent, which put it well within
international requirements. SEBanken's total risk capital amounted to
SKr31.4bn on April 30.
The bank estimates that its total provisions could amount to SKr7.5bn for
the whole of 1992 after reaching a figure of SKr4.76bn last year.
The crisis in Sweden's property market and construction industry have hit
SEB and other Swedish banks badly.
Last week Coronado, the third largest listed property company on the
Stockholm bourse, suspended payments on its outstanding debt of between
SKr3bn and SKr4bn.
Its main bankers are SEBanken and Nordbanken, the Swedish state-owned
loss-making bank that is about to be bought up completely by the government.
Nordbanken last week reported a SKr1.97bn loss for the first four months of
the year.
Mr Bjorn Svedberg, SEBanken's recently appointed chief executive who was
formerly in charge of Ericsson, the big Swedish telecommunications group,
also faces difficulties in reviving morale at the bank.
He is the third person to hold the top post there in less than three years.
Even if the provisions are excluded from the figures, the bank's operating
profit fell 19 per cent in the first four months to SKr1.9bn from SKr2.3bn
for the same period of 1991.
For the whole of last year the group operating profit after provisions fell
30 per cent to SKr2.326bn after provisions.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RAPID fading of post-election enthusiasm in the UK stock market has been
confirmed in a survey of UK fund managers by the Gallup polling organisation
on behalf of Smith New Court, the London-based integrated and international
securities house.
A balance of 15 per cent of senior fund managers in the survey this month
expected to increase their holdings of UK equities, compared with 18 per
cent last month, and 49 per cent at the beginning of April when the London
market was awaiting the general election.
The survey reinforces the trend towards increased investment in Japanese and
European equities at the expense of US stocks.
The balance of those taking a bullish view of the FT-SE Index over the
coming three months has fallen from 32 per cent in May to only 12 per cent.
A Footsie of 2,990 is predicted for June 1993, compared with Friday's close
of 2,668.5. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is seen at 3,458 in 12 months,
against Friday's 3,398.69.
Those planning to sell US equities have jumped from 25 per cent in May to 37
per cent in June. Prospective buyers of European equities increased their
net dominance from 16 per cent to 22 per cent, while prospective buyers of
Japanese shares remain in a majority, albeit down from 37 per cent to 29 per
cent.
Senior representatives of 100 fund management groups handling funds
totalling Pounds 498bn took part in the survey.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Economics Notebook: Buenos Aires puts out the inflation
fires
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Even by Latin American standards, Argentina's inflation record over the past
30 years is something special. While world prices rose on average 14 times
between 1960 and 1990; in Latin America they went up 1.7bn times and in
Brazil 1.9bn times. In Argentina, prices increased by a multiple of 359bn.
So for most Argentines, the past year has offered something different.
Recently, retail prices have been rising between 1 and 2 per cent a month;
wholesale price inflation has been running at an annual rate of 5 per cent
or less.
This sharp drop is due to two factors: the creation of a surplus in the
budget and the tying by law, since April 1, 1991, of the Argentine currency
to the US dollar. This convertibility law more or less prevents the central
bank from issuing local currency unless backed by inflows of foreign
exchange.
Thus the central bank has been converted, nearly, into a currency board such
as that in Hong Kong, though an important difference is that the bank can
also issue currency against its volatile holdings of Bonex, a shrinking pool
of government-issue dollar-denominated bonds.
The Argentine government has, in effect, turned its economy into an economic
region of the US. Since Argentina has an annual per capita income of Dollars
18,000 less than the US and is distanced from it by several thousand miles,
history and language, it would be not be surprising that such an arrangement
can cause strains.
On the face of it, Argentina's economy should be under strain. Retail prices
have risen more than 30 per cent since the currency was fixed, against about
4 per cent in the US.
But if this suggests a dramatic loss of competitiveness for Argentine
industry, the reality is less dramatic. Most inflation has taken place in
the oligopolistic retail and services sector not subject to foreign
competition. This has turned Buenos Aires into one of the world's most
expensive cities but has yet to cause huge damage to industry. The
government has also cut tariff barriers, which, combined with fixing of the
nominal exchange rate, has put downward pressure on input prices.
The risk to competitiveness is that relatively high retail inflation -
compounded by forthcoming rises in value added tax rates and a broadening of
the tax's scope - could translate into demand for higher wages. This is
bound to bring increased pressure for devaluation.
Further pressure for devaluation from Argentina's protected industry may
grow as imports continue to climb. In 1990, imports totalled Dollars 4.1bn
(Pounds 2.25bn); in 1991 they nearly doubled to Dollars 8.1bn; this year,
they could reach Dollars 11bn.
However, the architect of the convertibility law, the economy minister, Mr
Domingo Cavallo, does not have much faith in devaluation. He believes
competitive benefits deriving from it are transitory in an inflation-prone
economy such as Argentina's where it takes only one or two months for such
advantages to be lost in price rises.
He might not be worried either by rising imports and the shrinking trade
surplus. Some imports are of capital goods, raising an abysmally low
investment rate which fell below 8 per cent of GDP in 1990; the rest are for
now adequately financed by inflows of capital helping to swell reserves.
Although the reserve inflow is swelling the monetary base, this is not
necessarily inflationary. Some economists argue that when inflationary
expectations drop sharply, people are willing to hold cash for longer and
the velocity of circulation falls.
In Brazil, it is easy to find sceptics about the Argentine economic miracle.
None the less, the gradualist policies of economy minister Mr Marcilio
Marques Moreira seem to be making slow headway against inflation, running at
about 20 per cent a month. Perhaps he might try a drop of Argentine
medicine?
Asked about this possibility last month, Mr Moreira said it would be
'unthinkable' to subject the Brazilian economy to the 'straitjacket' of a
fixed currency.
Indeed, such a move might risk putting the cart before the horse. The
Argentine government has been generating a primary surplus, even before
privatisation receipts, sufficient to allow it to finance interest payments
on debts in a non-inflationary manner. Better control of public finances was
evident in Argentina even before April 1 last year, but is far from proven
in Brazil, where the political process lacks credibility.
Mr Paul Luke, an economist with Morgan Grenfell asset trading unit, says the
reserves of the central bank in Brazil (the monetary base of a currency
board) - currently between Dollars 14bn and Dollars 18bn, depending on
definition - may be too small a proportion of an economy with annual gross
domestic product of more than Dollars 520bn. Argentina's reserves of more
than Dollars 7bn compare with an Dollars 80bn GDP.
Although Brazilian tariffs have been cut, they are three times the level on
average of this in Argentina. This may make transition to a new regime more
difficult in Brazil, since downward pressure on input costs in Argentina
would not be in place for Brazilian industry.
Of course, the eventual success of the policy is not proven in Argentina. Mr
Lawrence Brainard of Goldman Sachs in New York says, in the long-term, the
currency board system depends on interest rates influencing the real
economy. It not clear whether a 1 percentage point increase in interest
rates would have any noticeable impact in Argentina. 'The linkages in the
economy are a lot looser than in a place like Hong Kong,' he says.
Perhaps it is no coincidence that Mr Cavallo is an economic historian. For
Argentina has tried the currency board idea before. Late in the 19th
century, Argentina tied its currency to the pound sterling and became part
of the sterling area. In retrospect, these have proved to be Argentina's
golden years.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Bush adviser seeks clemency for former Ferranti executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN and TOM FLANNERY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LANCASTER, PENNSYLVANIA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A TOP intelligence adviser to US President George Bush has written to a US
judge to try to help win a lighter prison sentence for Mr James Guerin, the
convicted former deputy chairman of Ferranti, the UK defence electronics
group.
The letter, from Admiral Bobby Ray Inman, marks the first time any US
government official has substantiated Mr Guerin's claim that he worked
secretly with the Central Intelligence Agency and other agencies.
Disclosure of the letter could have repercussions in US political circles,
as well as among members of the board of Ferranti in Britain. Admiral Inman,
a former deputy director of the CIA who is the acting chairman of Mr Bush's
foreign intelligence advisory board, is also a paid member of the proxy
board of a Ferranti US offshoot. Such 'buffer' boards comprising former US
government officials are required by law for American subsidiaries of
foreign companies engaged in classified contracts.
Admiral Inman yesterday denied any conflict of interest between his proxy
board role and his writing a letter that could help a convicted former
Ferranti executive to receive a shorter prison term.
Both Ferranti's US lawyers and the prosecutors are hoping for a heavy prison
term for Mr Guerin.
Ferranti, which only learned of the letter at the weekend, is believed to be
paying Admiral Inman about Dollars 25,000 (Pounds 13,736) a year.
In London, Mr Eugene Anderson, the US-born Ferranti chairman, was last night
believed to be considering a response. Mr Jim Shinehouse, president of
Ferranti USA, said he was only authorised by London to state: 'At this time
Ferranti chooses not to make a comment.'
Mr Guerin, who in 1987 sold International Signal and Control (ISC) of
Pennsylvania to Ferranti, will be sentenced tomorrow after agreeing a plea
bargain in the US on charges of defrauding Ferranti of Dollars 1.1bn. He was
also charged with Dollars 950m of money laundering and the illegal transfer
of military technologies to South Africa and Iraq.
Admiral Inman's letter to Judge Louis Bechtle in Philadelphia is dated April
27 1992 and was submitted by Mr Guerin's lawyer along with a memorandum
arguing for a reduced prison term. It says the former Ferranti deputy
chairman 'displayed patriotism toward our country' during work with US
intelligence agencies in the 1970s.
Admiral Inman, travelling in Germany, said yesterday he submitted the letter
on behalf of Mr Guerin 'because his lawyer asked me to'.

FT  08 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Water sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's deal on capital spending between Ofwat and North West Water was
at first sight unremarkable. North West came up with Pounds 360m of extra
spending to compensate for earlier under-estimates. The regulator has
allowed the company a real return of 7 per cent on the new capital, but
stipulated that customers must not suffer price rises higher than those
allowed for at privatisation three years ago.
On further examination, the arrangement looks distinctly curious. North
West's capital spending forecast in the 1989 prospectus was Pounds 2.2bn, so
the error was material even if one assumes the government was applying
downward pressure ahead of the flotation. The extra money will be spent
mainly on computers and information systems and rationalising buildings and
staff, improvements which the rest of the sector is managing largely within
the agreed budgets.
One of the axioms of privatisation was that companies should be exposed to
the discipline of the market. If North West's management got its capital
needs wrong, it is for the company and its shareholders to bear the
consequences. Instead, the regulator has offered them a novel form of
protection, on the apparent grounds that customers would otherwise suffer.
At the least, Ofwat might have found a less drastic way of encouraging North
West to improve its services.
Further, in principle the regulator should only condone significant extra
spending where the law has changed - as with South West Water's deal last
year - or where efficiencies can be introduced more quickly because
commercial conditions have altered. It may be that Ofwat has been too
concerned to establish in North West a benchmark against which to measure
all water companies' performance. It could yet come to regret allowing it
such favourable treatment.

FT  08 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: EFA
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At a time when Germany is agonising over whether to abandon the European
Fighter Aircraft, investors are bound to reflect on the position of the
companies supposed to be building it. In the unlikely event of the project's
being scrapped altogether, it is necessary to distinguish between aerospace
and electronics companies. For British Aerospace, the result would
undoubtedly be serious. As a supplier of both airframes and weapons, it
would find itself deprived of its future in combat aircraft. For GEC the
outcome might prove less damaging. The governments in the project have
already paid for the development of a large amount of sophisticated
electronic kit. Even if they backed away from building the EFA itself, they
would surely seek to deploy the gadgetry in existing aircraft. The same
should be partly true for Rolls-Royce as engine supplier.
But such an extreme case seems unlikely. By all accounts, the project would
be feasible if as few as 400 aircraft were built. If Germany and even Spain
pulled out, the UK and Italy could with luck make up the total with the help
of exports to such as Saudi Arabia and Malaysia. The dwindling of the
project to an Anglo-Italian alliance would be a blow to its status. But
since production will be allocated according to how much each country buys,
the UK's apparently firm intention to order 200 aircraft would give it a
larger share of a smaller project.
The argument within Germany may also belong within a broader political
context these days. The immediate savings from pulling out would be modest,
since Germany only ever meant to buy less than 20 aircraft this side of the
millennium. With the EC in turmoil after the Danish referendum, this is
hardly the time for Germany to make a highly publicised withdrawal from a
European agreement.

As the UK market gropes in vain for signs of an upturn in consumer spending,
a disquieting thought occurs. The UK government is squaring up to a
particularly grim public spending round. One consequence is bound to be
further job losses in the public sector. A decade ago, the old concept of a
job for life was abolished for steelworkers and miners. It then started to
die for bank clerks and telephone operators. It is now dying for civil
servants, teachers and hospital workers. In the long run, this may prove
beneficial in breaking down traditional rigidities in the UK labour market.
But its transitional effect on consumer confidence looks decidedly awkward.
At a time when the population has grasped that house price inflation is a
thing of the past, who is there left with a safe enough job to risk a big
mortgage?

The flag of dissent hoisted over Maastricht last week was a particularly
grim sight for participants in the Ecu bond market. Denmark's vote against
the treaty sent investors scurrying to sell, and left would-be issuers of
the fledgling Euro-currency looking distinctly glum. Their fear is that if
the Emu bandwagon really comes off the rails, the Ecu will prove a basket
case in more senses than one. It will revert to its original status as a
basket of currencies, useful merely as a convenient short cut to investing
separately in each of the component parts.
Until the first half of 1991, Ecu bonds generally traded around their
theoretical, or synthetic yields. But when it became clear that the Ecu
could be transformed one day into a proper parallel currency, spreads
between the actual and theoretical yield began to reflect more than the mere
saving on transaction costs. The signing of the Maastricht Treaty by heads
of government last December prompted a rash of new Ecu bond issues and saw
spreads on some maturities reaching 60 to 80 basis points over the
theoretical yield.
In retrospect it is hard to account for the euphoria. But a premium at the
time seemed justified on the grounds that Ecu depreciation was a lesser risk
than individual currency depreciation in the run-up to monetary union. That
was based on a political calculation which, following the Danish vote, can
no longer be taken for granted. Hence Friday's further fall-out in the Ecu
bond market, when spreads fell below 10 basis points.
On the basis that the Ecu is still destined to be Europe's currency but that
the date has been pushed into the next century, the longer-dated issues may
still be worth holding. Until the dust settles, fair value for shorter
maturities must surely be close to the theoretical yield.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Letter: Training in UK needs to be formalised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Sir, Sir John Cassels admirably explains (Personal View, June 2) why so few
16- to 18-year-olds benefit from education and training on a par with
Britain's competitors. Our 'system' works against the grain of human nature.
Sir John's solution works with it.
As he says, all 16- to 19-year-olds' further education has to be
state-funded and the cost of trainees' pay or, preferably, allowances, has
to be balanced by the value of the trainee's output. In the interests of the
trainee, there should be a formal training contract, culminating in a
nationally recognised qualification.
Employers need to be involved to ensure the quality of craft-technician
level vocational programmes remains ahead of our competitors. There is a
danger it will not, as more young people remain in full-time education,
unless a market system as described by Sir John is created.
The Engineering Employers' Federation has been campaigning for such changes.
Early Youth Training Scheme policy was establishing the right attitudes,
funding, training contracts and trainee allowances. Regrettably, the
essential national qualification and quality control system was not then in
place. A critical first move would be for the government to reinstate those
early policies and use training credits as the funding mechanisms.

It won't be all plain sailing at actuaries R. Watson's forthcoming seminar.
The first session is called 'A plain man's guide to the US benefit scene',
and the second 'A plain man's guide to the Canadian benefit scene'.
But the next is 'Expatriates: benefits and related tax issues.'
The reason for the style-change isn't hard to find. While men will present
the first two, the third will be run by Ruth Ryals of George Beram &amp; Co in
Boston. 'A plain woman's guide . . .' would be less than politically

Wouldn't it be nice if Premier John Major's commitment to open government
shed some light on Whitehall's secretive system for deciding public
spending?
Opening up the process to public scrutiny might arguably help the government
to reach better decisions. But officials have rejected requests for
publication of details of the spending bids different departments are now
submitting as part of the build-up to the Treasury's Autumn Statement.
By custom, the papers are never published, though no one can rule out
'leaks' of selected contents by individual departments anxious to press
their case for more money.
While the public would clearly be better informed about the issues if
different departments' bids were open to examination, the official view
remains that government efficiency is best served if the arguments go on
behind closed doors. Another piece of civil service stone-walling that needs
knocking down.

Another tell-tale sign that all is not well at Wasserstein Perella, the
high-flying international investment banking boutique?
Alan Stephenson, co-head of the merger and acquisitions advisory group, has
decided to hand in his notice and return to his old law firm, Cravath,
Swaine &amp; Moore.
He insists his decision to jump ship says nothing about the future of
Wasserella, founded by former Wall Street takeover superstars Bruce
Wasserstein and Joe Perella, 'I had never lost my interest in law,' explains
Stephenson who is expected to re-recruit old clients such as Time and CBS.
Even so, the departure of a professional of his calibre suggests that some
of the other big names lured to Wasserella a couple of years ago may be
rethinking their careers.
At 69, the London operation's chairman Lord Haslam is probably too old to
bother about moving. But one wonders how much longer an ambitious type like
Sir Peter Levene, 50-year-old former head of defence procurement at
Britain's defence ministry, is going to hang around.
After all, if Levene was working flat out on Wasserella business, he'd
surely not be collecting odd jobs such as the chairmanship of the Docklands
Light Railway - let alone have the spare time to advise the prime minister
on efficiency.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Observer: Extra time for Dunkel
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Long-suffering Arthur Dunkel, director general of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, looks like breaking yet another of the deadlines he has
set in recent years - that for his own retirement.
Ambassador Lars Anell, Swedish head of the Gatt committee responsible for
finding a successor, is being told by other Gatt ambassadors that the
uncertain plight of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks makes it
impossible to pinpoint the right person.
In December, when Dunkel released his 'Final Act' - a draft Uruguay Round
agreement meant to break deadlock in negotiations that began in Punta del
Este six years ago - he announced he'd retire at the end of 1992. That was
the date by which the trade agreement was due to be implemented.
He also set a deadline of Easter for negotiators to agree in principle to
the final act's terms, hoping his scheduled resignation would force the
pace.
Alas, with Easter well past, US and EC trade negotiators are still wrangling
over dismantling farm protection. Prospects for an agreement by the year end
are dimming by the day. Ambassador Anell, supposed to start formal
discussions with Gatt signatories on the search for a successor at the
beginning of July, is being informally told he is wasting his time.
Two factors are inhibiting the search. First, there are fears that if Dunkel
retires before his final act is endorsed, the draft will die with his
departure. 'There are a number of officials who see him as the guarantor of
the draft,' said a senior member of a western Gatt mission. Second, without
successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round, it is not possible to tell
candidates what kind of institution they'd be heading.
Current betting is that Dunkel will be asked to stay on for a further six
months. But, this time at least, nobody's setting any firm deadlines.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Letter: Maastricht ratification would herald legal maze for
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mrs CELIA HAMPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Politicians might like to consider the plight of the European
businessman - an intended beneficiary of the single market of 1993 - if the
11 decide to ratify the Maastricht amendments without Denmark.
In 1993, the businessman will have to obey the amended EC Treaty in 10
countries, including its new legally-binding objectives. Some of these, such
as the protection of consumers and the environment, are highly relevant to
everyday business and will be given practical meaning by the European Court.
In the UK, he will be able to ignore some of the employment-related rules
agreed by the 10, but he will have to comply with the new objectives. In
Denmark, he will have to comply with Community law as it is at present, but
he can ignore the new objectives. In Sweden, Switzerland or the other EFTA
countries, he will also have to obey existing Community law, without the new
objectives, under the EEA Agreement, but reliance on Community law will be
more precarious because there will be no common court to enforce it. In
Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Poland he will have to obey the parts of
Community law which are embodied in the three Association Agreements.
These extra layers of Community law will be in addition to the burden of
complying with local national laws. One could hardly blame the businessman
for staying at home: he will need a battery of lawyers to advise him every
time he strays abroad. For whose benefit were the Community and its single
market conceived?
For Community law, the Maastricht compromise allowing the UK to secede from
part of the Treaty (the 'social protocol') contained the seeds of
destruction. Adoption of the Maastricht amendments by only some of the EC
will secure germination.

<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to correct an impression given by Mr Hanson (Letters, May
22) that the licence condition derogation granted to National Grid for the
connection of the Grey-stones Power Station may compromise system security.
The derogation will allow output from Greystones to be sold into the
electricity pool before associated grid system reinforcements are complete.
The station will be able to generate at full output under normal grid system
conditions, but with a severely restricted output when transmission outages
occur. Arrangements will be made by National Grid for automatic reduction of
station output when required. Thus Greystones itself will be connected at a
reduced level of security. The remainder of the system, including
connections to other power stations and regional electricity companies, will
operate to the standards placed on National Grid by its transmission
licence.
Security of supply to customers will be unchanged by this arrangement, but
customers will stand to benefit from the earlier introduction of an
efficient power station on to the grid system.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Public policy and the banks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THOSE who were worried at the prospect of further shrinkage in the
already thin ranks of the British clearing banks, the withdrawal of Lloyds
from the battle for Midland will be a cause for rejoicing. Yet the crude
numbers remain an exceptionally poor indicator of the public policy fallout
in this tightly argued battle.
In terms of the public interest, the respective merits of Lloyds and
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation as owners of Midland always
depended heavily on how the problems of the British banking system were
defined. If the problem was a lack of competition, a victory for Lloyds was
likely to be a mixed blessing, and not necessarily because of the impact on
hard-hit small businesses. For it could be argued that banks simply do not
behave competitively in this sector in a recession, tout court, and that a
reduction in clearing bank numbers might not have affected the issue much
one way or another. But the Monopolies Commission would probably have raised
concerns about other areas of the two banks' businesses.
If, on the other hand, the more pressing problem is surplus capacity, the
Lloyds' proposals for pruning branches and employees provided a more
efficient solution than anything the Hongkong Bank could offer. The building
societies are banks in all but name and competition in retail banking is
fierce. In wholesale banking, the barriers to entry have been substantially
dismantled, to the delight of the large contingent of foreign bankers in
London.
Huge profits
Hongkong Bank raises an altogether different set of issues. With its strong
balance sheet and huge profits in Asia, it will undoubtedly lend muscle to a
British clearer that has been forced to curb its ambitions because of a
conspicuous shortage of profits. While the need to look after sensitivities
in Beijing may militate against big injections of capital into Midland,
everything nonetheless points in the direction of greater competition, not
less, assuming the takeover is completed. The addition of external capital
to British banking would also have the beneficial effect of reducing any
financial constraint on economic recovery.
Yet increased competition is not an unequivocal boon in banking. Over the
past decade, deregulation has done more to destabilise banking systems than
to generate beneficial increases in efficiency. Bringing external capital to
an already fragile banking market could thus make it even more unstable.
Looked at from another perspective, Hongkong Bank's earlier expansionary
moves, especially into the US, have not been well managed. Nothing in the
past record points to increased efficiency at Midland coming from a powerful
new ownership discipline.
Difficult issues
These issues of competition and excess capacity are exceptionally difficult
ones. A notable disadvantage of Lloyds' departure from the fray is that they
are less likely to be aired at length in public. Yet they need to be. For
the huge losses that have been incurred in banking across the world over the
past decade call for both radical analysis and novel policy proposals.
It has been fashionable for some time to draw a distinction in banking
between so-called niche players and those banks that offer a full range of
services. Yet it could be argued that the full-service bank, of which
Hongkong-Midland will be an example, is really no more than a collection of
loosely- knit businesses whose shape owes more to historical circumstance
than any overwhelming synergy or customer need. Were it not for the central
bankers' continuing desire to rule out takeovers by non-banks, the aspiring
full-service banks would long since have been recognised for what they are:
conglomerates. The so-called full range of services would have been
unceremoniously unbundled - not least at Midland and Hongkong and Shanghai.
In the absence of a more open market in corporate control, these giants
lumber on, their behaviour dictated as much by the quest for size as profit.
In the meantime, the casualties - mainly in the US and Scandinavia in the
present economic cycle - make bigger and bigger demands on the public
finances. It is not a sustainable situation. And it is bizarre that it has
yet to find its way on to the policy agenda.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Arts: The False Servant - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dr Johnson knew that people reveal confidences in order to show that they
had been trusted in the first place. In 1724 his contemporary, Pierre
Marivaux (1688-1783), wrote a satire based on this fact of human nature and
called it La Fausse Suivante (The False Servant). He made it intellectually
puzzling and morally complex, but kept it light. The new production at the
Gate Theatre, Notting Hill - a British premiere - answers Marivaux with a
delightfully-paced evening of rapid-fire dialogue and shifts of plot.
The action centres on a Chevalier who has disguised herself as a man in
order to probe the protean deceits of Lelio, whom she thinks she loves.
Lelio in turn, randy for gain, has betrothed a rich Countess and is yoked to
her by bonds of forfeit rather than love. Lelio, believing the Chevalier is
a man, enjoins him to woo the Countess into breaking her betrothal and
paying the forfeit. Meanwhile Trivelin, the Chevalier's duplicitous servant
and Arlequin, the lovelorn clown of the house reveal the Chevalier's true
identity, one through venality and the other through stupidity. The
Chevalier disrobed turns out to be a prospect that Lelio has coveted from
afar. Nobody marries.
The result is a serious comedy that feels like Haydn's 'The Joke' in that
one is never quite sure it has ended, and sounds like the best of Alfred de
Musset, in that one never wants it to. Deceit and disguise dominate the
action, which itself appeals to a set of constantly changing unseen rules,
always governed by the final injunction that the rules can change any
minute.
The insights emerge from the meeting of the unshockable with the
undeterrable. The pattern of tests, feints, parries is always motivated by a
saving of face and a saving of money. Negotiations and love songs are often
mistaken for one and the same.
The sharp translation from Jonathan Guy Martin (who directs) and Mary Ann
Vargas keeps the ethos of the original, giving it a modern bite without
resort to modern infelicity. All the characters are obsessed with form and
forms of language. This can be very funny indeed: 'Sir,' says the Countess,
''sensitive to' is going too far. You could have said 'aware of'.' The
interchange between characters at full stretch also finds a moral level: 'Do
you repent the wrong? or your failure to succeed?'
The acting keeps up with the action. Crispin Redman plays Lelio as a mincing
cadaver; his limber interchanges with William Hope's Trivelin and
Christabelle Dilks' Chevalier (not yet his nimble equal) form the centre of
the action. Susannah Morley plays a leaden-footed Countess. Robust music,
bawdy intrusions from a party of wedding guests, and a simple plain set
complete the salon effect. One pedantry: when a character says 'time's
ticking away', he should not twitch at his wrist. It was only 1724.
The Gate Theatre (071 229 0706) until 4 July

FT  08 JUN 92 / Arts: Mario and the Magician - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW PORTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Janos Vajda's and the late Stephen Oliver's versions of Mario and the
Magician (both 1988) were one-act operas; the first was given in a
double-bill with Dido, the other with Offenbach's Ba-ta-clan. Harry Somers's
Mario and the Magician, which had its premiere in Toronto last week, is in
three acts and lasts three hours. The Canadian Opera Company maintains a
steady output of new Canadian operas, but Mario was its first 'mainstage'
premiere in 18 years - preceded by Charles Wilson's Heloise and Abelard in
1973, and Somers's own Louis Riel in 1967. It was a success: warmly
acclaimed by the public, brilliantly performed by the company.
Canadian Opera, with Brian Dickie as general manager and Richard Bradshaw as
music director, is flourishing. Thirty-five of the 36 singers in Mario, most
of them young, came from the company, and were there space enough all would
be named and praised, for there was a vivacity and precision in the
performance that held eye and ear. Among the prominent were Theodore Baerg
(Mann, renamed Stefan), Marcia Swanston (his wife), Andre Clouthier (the
chief heckler), Heather Thompson, Cornelis Opthof, Benoit Boutet (Mario),
and the treble Patrick Torcat.
But wherever the eye fell, it fell upon performers alert in response and
reaction; and the orchestra of 26 (woodwind and brass quartets, saxophone,
harp, piano, percussion, and strings), conducted by Bradshaw, played with a
like animation. Robert Carsen, the producer, combined dynamic stage
pictures, ingeniously and economically devised, with attentive inspiration
of each individual character.
The work itself? Shadowed, for me, by Britten's Death in Venice; I'm still
under the impact of Covent Garden's recent production, and Philip
Langridge's Aschenbach. In Mann's Mario und der Zauberer, the
Aschenbach/Mann of Der Tod in Venedig is developed and split into two
separate characters - the German narrator, striving to keep Apollonian
detachment, and the Magician, Cipolla, shamelessly flaunting his Dionysian
powers and at last bringing the boy into his arms and onto his lips. Der
Zauberer - the hypnotic manipulator of words to bring people to his way of
thinking - was Mann's family nickname.
But there are also what Mann called 'minor political highlights and topical
allusions tucked away' in the successor tale - the grotesque but potent
Cipolla as a Mussolini hypnotising decent Italians into indecent behaviour.
But 'I should prefer to see its significance in the realm of ethics rather
than politics,' Mann said.
In Somers's opera the minor political allusions were not tucked away but
dominant: a portrait of Il Duce hung on the back wall, replaced at the close
by one of Der Fuhrer; Giovinezza, the now-banned Fascist anthem, was the
first-act finale. (It is a fiendishly catchy tune; during the interval
people could be heard happily humming it.)
Carsen, on a stage bared to a blackened back wall, and with almost all his
characters black-clad (even on the beach), displayed not a smiling,
seductive Italy menaced but one already blightened, blackened, and
bellicose; blackshirted, jackbooted squadristi were prominent supers. The
fabulous, enduringly apposite qualities of the novella were diminished to an
historical episode - an effect emphasised by the framing of the tale within
a 1919 Munich lecture on the menace of totalitarianism. Acts 2 and 3, played
without an interval, were Cipolla's show.
Rod Anderson, the librettist, left nothing out (as Vajda and Oliver did),
conscientiously underlined and expanded what was there, and added more of
his own. This was a protracted music-theatre account of Mann's novella. But
one that was gripping, for Somers is an able, efficient, and experienced
composer. His manner varied from neoclassical Stravinskian scherzo (complex
only on the page and for the performers, with its ever-changing metres) to
Britten-type - but not Britten-great  - lyricism. There was free-range
harmony, often with parallel fourths beneath figuration. The score was not
boring.
The opera was done not in Toronto's 3200-seat O'Keefe barn but in the
company's other house, the 1500-seat Elgin, where operas can tell. (Its
bright, intimate acoustics allowed some of Somers's exuberant brass writing
to drown the words.) Cipolla's audience, until he summoned them to the
stage, was seated in and sang from open boxes rather like those in the
Edinburgh King's. As the Magician, the American tenor David Rampy gave a
terrific performance. It is a role that calls for a Jon Vickers. Rampy has a
heavy, clumsy, powerful voice - a potent character-tenor without beauty but
on an heroic scale - and a presence and utterance that from his first,
insolent entrance until the melodramatic finale nearly two hours later, held
spellbound both his figured and the real audience.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Arts: The RA's cupboard is full of surprises - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Reviewing the Royal Academy's annual Summer Exhibition is one of the bench
marks for a critic of the architectural year. At a time when the rate of new
architectual commissions for architects has slowed down alarmingly because
of the recession, the RA exhibition provides a good opportunity to consider
the state of the art. The Academy this year has described the Summer
Exhibition as being about complexity. It is certainly not one of those shows
that eliminates contradictions in order to produce a rational and clear
statement about the visual arts.
Architecture and architects now plays a much a much more important part in
the Academy's activities and the placing of the architecture room in Gallery
VI means that it is right on the main axis from the Central Hall. The rich
mixture of models and drawings makes this room look like an intriguing
cupboard full to bursting with potential surprises. It seemed less
predictable than last year and highly catholic in its selection.
What are the acknowledged 'masters' showing this year? James Stirling
exhibits his competition entry for the Kyoto Centre in Japan, and shows once
again his particular drawing skill. Stirling remains an architect completely
outside the current architectural stylistic debate, pursuing his sculptural
approach to architecture that sees each new commission as a work of modern
art.
Sir Richard Rogers has strayed beyond the architecture room and you will
have to look in Gallery One to see his geometric study of the Court of Human
Rights that he is building in Strasbourg. This is a major commission for a
British architect and, as a rather simple exercise in basic geometry, it
looks as though it may be a building with a tough presence. Rogers continues
the European theme by showing his great model of his proposals for the
Potsdamer/Leipziger Platz in Berlin. This seems to be a somewhat
schizophrenic scheme: half wants to follow the formal street plan of the
city and half wants to impose giant and unfriendly buildings upon the
hapless inhabitants; because of the democratic nature of the German planning
system, it seems unlikely that that one architect will be allowed to impose
his own vision upon such a large slice of the new city. In his unsuccessful
competition entry for the new Inland Revenue headquarters in Nottingham,
Rogers vast elegant glass tents certainly showed considerable panache.
The third member of the trio of Academician 'masters', Sir Norman Foster,
remains, for me, the most disciplined and elegant of them all. He shows this
year his winning design for the new airport - the Chek Lap Kok Airport in
Hong Kong. The great relief model shows how clearly Foster grasps the
complexities of modern air transport and refines the problems they cause
down to a solution of distinction and style. We know from the completed
terminal at Stansted that he can produce a public space of great light and
beauty. The impressive thing about the Hong Kong airport is that it is the
corner stone of some ten major infrastructure projects for the Crown Colony.
British Government please copy at home . . . Can there be something wrong
when this trio of such prominent architects are all exhibiting as their
major work projects that are being built abroad ?
British architects do, however, exhibit some highly distinctive British
characteristics in the exhibition. There is nothing wrong with an affection
for history and it is always fascinating to examine some of the drawings
that accompany conservation activity. Proposals for the insertion of an art
gallery inside the shell of that neglected masterpiece, Alexander 'Greek'
Thompson's Caledonia Road Church in Glasgow, by Gillian McInnes may prompt
more action to save that splendid building. It is interesting to compare
this scheme with the plans exhibited by David Chipperfield for the major
alterations to that strangely Islamic looking First Church of Christ
Scientist in London's Sloane Terrace. Chipperfield's solution has a clarity
and boldness that should be commended. The detailed study for the
replacement of railings at Gibbs's great church of St. Mary-le-Strand in
London by Donald Insall reflect the care and craftmanship that is still
active in this country.
There are a few exhibits that really belong as much in the art galleries as
in the architecture room. Surely Ben Johnson's two paintings of European
interiors, the great vista orf the Cini Foundation and the view of part of
Chateau Margaux, would have raised the standard in the main painting
gallery, Gallery III? Michael Sandle's study for an architectural monument
also has a place to elevate the sculpture selection.
There is an underlying theme in the RA show that affects the artists as well
as the architects, and that is the increasingly visible concern with
landscape. The wonderful panoramic landscape painting by Michael Andrews and
Richard Long's Two Stones represent the the two poles of landscape art. In
the architecture room, the finely detailed drawings of Sir Geoffrey Jellicoe
for a classical garden, an Egyptian garden and an English Wiltshire garden
show the lasting influence of this old master of the land. Landscape is a
whole area that the British understand and are once again beginning to
reinterpret as a new art form. I detected some of this thinking in two works
very strongly: in Richard Reid's 'Greenville, an Urban Village' traditional
landscape and settlement patterns are reinterpreted; senand in Edward
Cullinan's design for the National Trust Visitors' Centre at Fountains Abbey
in Yorkshire the interweaving of the architecture, the landscape and the
siting promises to be a remarkable contribution to this encouraging marriage
of architecture and nature.

Having gone from managing director to the dole queue, Philip Walker started
the Campaign Against Age Discrimination in Employment, subject of Open Space
(7.40 BBC2).
Horizon (8.10 BBC2) and World In Action (8.30 ITV) are both concerned with
international sport. The former promises to tell the story of 'State Plan
14.25', East Germany's programme for the routine drugging of the former
country's sporting elite. The latter shows the second half of its report on
the Olympics including the way in which cities compete for the right to
stage the games, and again the widespread use of drugs. The Guilty is a
four-hour thriller to be shown wrapped around News At 10 today and tomorrow.
Michael Kitchen, we are told, plays a 'ruthless barrister' about to be
appointed a judge 'but his fatal flaws are alcohol and women'. That word
'fatal' might ruin the plot. BBC1 repeats Tumbledown Charles Wood's
outstanding drama - vivid and technically superb, pro-soldier but anti-war -
about the Falklands war and in particular Scots Guards Lieutenant Robert
Lawrence who had the top of his head blown off by a sniper (10.10).

FT  08 JUN 92 / People: Shell Shock
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHELL TRANSPORT AND TRADING has yet to put a woman on its board but it has
demonstrated that it is more imaginative than many British multinationals by
appointing its first academic. Professor Bob O'Neill, Chichele professor of
the history of war at Oxford, has joined Shell as a non-executive director.
Until now the non-executive members on Shell's board have consisted of
retired senior civil servants, ex-diplomats and well-connected businessmen.
But the company has tended to pick its non-executive directors for their
broad strategic vision rather than their specialised expertise, so the
choice of a 55-year-old Australian military historian and veteran of the
Vietnam war is not as big a break with tradition as it might at first seem.
Shell Transport, the British end of the Royal Dutch Shell group, is one of
the world's most successful oil companies and analysts often ascribe this
success to its ability to think very long term about where its business is
going. Whereas other oil multinationals tend to be buffeted by short term
events, Shell puts a lot of effort into scenario planning exercises. Its
board of directors tend to be tapped for their geopolitical skills rather
than their abilities to explain the latest change in accounting standards.
Given this background, Professor O'Neill's expertise will come in handy. A
Rhodes scholar, he served in the Australian army between 1955 and 1968, has
been the official Australian historian for the Korean war, and headed
Australia's strategic and defence studies centre for a decade until 1982.
He then directed the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London
for five years and since 1987 has been based in Oxford where he is a fellow
of All Souls.
Professor O'Neill is the second non-executive appointment to the Shell board
in recent months. Last November, Sir Antony Acland, 62, former head of the
diplomatic service and ambassador to Washington, was appointed. They replace
Edmund Dell, a former Labour secretary of state for trade, and Sir Michael
Palliser, a former head of the diplomatic service, who have retired on
reaching 70.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Management: Spreading the Coke message from Pole to Pole - A
whole new way of work for staff at the Gdynia bottling plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE OVERALLS are clean and pressed and waiting for you every morning and
you don't have to sign a chit for them.' This is what strikes the 230 Poles
who have started work at Coca-Cola's new bottling plant in Gdynia.
'We find people who wear them take more pride in their work and it makes
them stand out when they drive out to town,' says Michal Rossa, the
company's manager. Rossa got the job after placing an advertisement seeking
work in the newspaper when he was deputy head of a state-owned shipping
company.
From Rossa down, all employees find the style different, the pace faster and
the pay higher than they had been used to in state companies. 'I didn't do
much where I worked before but I didn't earn much either,' says one employee
on the bottling line in Gdynia.
Many also speak of a friendly team spirit, with management much readier to
delegate responsibility. The new management praises the underlings for their
enthusiasm and readiness to work.
Pay levels at the new factory are not made public, as they were in the old
state sector. Indeed employees are discouraged from talking about how much
they earn.
However, the clash between the old ways of socialist management and the
brash new style that Coca-Cola affects is not as great as might appear at
first sight.
Most skills are still learnt on the job, although there is some training for
the sales people. Even Rossa worked out the management methods he is now
using while he was in his previous job. 'I just couldn't enforce them there
so I left.'
The chief difference is a rigorous staff selection process which includes
repeated interviews. At Gdynia, there are aptitude tests to help pick the
right person from the 10 who apply for each job.
'We wanted young people,' says Rossa, adding that talent and ability to
learn counted more than previous experience. Keeping staff is made easier by
the area's 12 per cent unemployment.
Not all the employees came from the state sector. For instance, Tomasz
Perepeczko, the head of production at Gdynia, worked before at a local,
Swedish-owned fish canning operation.
Coke is concentrating its efforts on marketing and maintaining contact with
the point of sale - and is already breaking ingrained habits among retailers
and competitors alike.
'I have to visit between 15 and 20 shops every day, making friends with the
owners and checking they have the product, are displaying it prominently and
that it looks good,' says one ambitious 30-year-old who previously drove an
inter-city bus. 'I have no complaints.'
Neville Isdell, president of Coke's north-east Europe-Africa division, sees
no theat from trade unions at Gdynia.
'We are present in 185 countries and we work with trade unions in some and
without trade unions in others. We have no rule about that.' So far there is
no sign that the Gdynia plant will have a union. For the moment the
employees seem intent on the prospects of vertical promotion.
'After all,' says one sales representative, 'Donald Keough, the Coca-Cola
president, started as a delivery boy and he made it to the top'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AMP, Australia's biggest life insurance company, has put the finishing
touches to its newly-established UK investment business by appointing the
Earl of Limerick as chairman of AMP Asset Management.
AMP Asset Management, which has Pounds 13bn of funds under management, was
set up last November following AMP's 1989 acquisitions of both Pearl
Assurance and London Life. AMP has combined Pearl's investment management
business with that of London Life's, lumping in its own international
investments as well. The new London-based operation is headed by Ray
Greenshields who came over from Australia last year.
Although AMP Asset Management is only managing the funds of its own
companies at present, Greenshields says that it will start offering its
investment skills to outsiders next year. It has recently hired John Whalley
from Norwich Union to look after its Pounds 1.5bn UK property portfolio and
a new marketing director is being recruited. Greenshields said that the new
group, which is heavily retail orientated, plans to expand into the
wholesale market.
In an effort to give the new group its own independent identity, Lord
Limerick, a former deputy chairman of Kleinwort Benson, has been recruited
to a board which includes Tom Hutchison, a former ICI executive, and John
Sadler, a former finance director of the John Lewis Partnership.
Lord Limerick, 62, who retired from the Kleinwort Benson Group in May 1990,
is chairman of Pirelli UK and a non-executive director of De La Rue.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Management: Sterling work in the treasury - Companies are
seizing opportunities to make their money work harder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until it was privatised just over two years ago, South West Water had
relatively little money to manage. Over the previous 10 years, the company
had built up debts of Pounds 130m, which were managed by the same man who
also ran the payroll and settled the company's bills.
Privatisation changed all that. In just two years, SW Water has put together
borrowing facilities worth Pounds 530m. It has begun using revolving
credits, signed up leasing facilities and last February, made its first
long-term sterling bond issue.
From managing SW Water's money part-time, Derek Bancroft has taken over
full-time responsibility for managing treasury operations and now has an
assistant and a money dealer to help him. Much of his time is spent
maintaining contacts with City institutions and the banks on which this more
elaborate financial framework depends.
SW Water was prompted into taking treasury management seriously by its
conversion into a public company. Other corporations are being forced by an
increasingly uncertain environment to improve their treasury management
skills.
The break-down of the Bretton Woods system of fixed interest rates in the
early 1970s and the deregulation of the banking industry have both created
greater opportunities and threats for companies with money to manage.
It is just over a year since Allied-Lyons, the UK drink and foods group,
announced a Pounds 150m loss on foreign currency operations while, in the
non-commercial sector, many local authorities are still smarting from losses
incurred from entrusting funds to the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International.
Every company has to manage treasury operations even if it does not apply a
formal label to the activity, says Gerald Leahy, director general of the
Association of Corporate Treasurers. Treasury may involve handling relations
with the company's banks; arranging cash transmissions; dealing in foreign
currencies; and raising outside finance. Depending on the size of the
company, these dealings may be handled by anyone from the chairman, through
the managing director and finance director to the company secretary.
Companies probably need to take on a full-time treasurer when turnover
reaches Pounds 200m-Pounds 250m, says Derek Ross, partner in charge of
treasury management at accountants Touche Ross. But they may need to move
earlier if they have sizeable borrowings or significant foreign exchange
activities, typically from Pounds 50m upwards.
Wassall, a listed manufacturing and distribution group with projected
turnover of Pounds 250m, decided to review its treasury management systems
in the wake of Allied-Lyons' foreign exchange losses. 'We got our auditors
to do a 'quick and dirty' review to see if there were any black holes,' says
David Roper, finance director.
Wassall has completed the first stage of beefing up its treasury systems by
introducing basic controls in group subsidiaries to avoid problems and to
hedge any foreign exchange exposures above agreed limits. The second stage
will be to appoint a full-time treasurer to monitor these operations
centrally and to plan ahead.
At present it hedges its foreign exchange exposure when booking an order but
it does not yet hedge anticipated exposure for the coming 12 months.
Central control will allow the company to match foreign exchange needs,
setting purchases against sales, and reducing the need to deal with the
banks. But while full-time treasury management only becomes necessary and
affordable when a company has reached a critical mass, even small companies
are becoming more sophisticated in managing their money.
Primasil, a Herefordshire-based manufacturer of silicon rubber compounds and
mouldings took out an interest rate cap on Pounds 250,000 of borrowings at
the suggestion of its bank manager. The cap means that Primasil, which
expects turnover to rise to Pounds 1.9m this year, has frozen interest rates
at 11 per cent for the next three years.
It took National Westminster Bank four months to sell its first interest
rate cap in 1987 but demand has taken off and it has sold more than 1,600
since January, says Chris Fountain, senior manager of the bank's capital
markets unit. NatWest has reduced the minimum size of cap available to
Pounds 100,000 from Pounds 5m in response to increased demand from smaller
customers, with sales of Pounds 1m or more.
Michael Pearce, founder of Pearce Management Consultants, based in
Hertfordshire, says demand from smaller, unquoted companies for treasury
advice has grown over the past year. 'Financial directors like to have a
framework to operate in,' he says. 'Before, if they speculated, they would
get it in the neck.'
But much of Pearce's work does not involve advising companies on arcane
financial transactions: it is a question of finding basic solutions to
management problems.
One British company was invoicing customers in Zambia in sterling for
supplies bought in dollars in the US, thereby running an exchange rate risk.
It did not matter to the Zambians which of the two currencies they used so
Pearce suggested invoicing in dollars to cut out the exchange risk.
Pearce spends a few hours a week with some of his clients handling their
treasury operations. Not only would the smaller company be unable to afford
the Pounds 40,000-Pounds 50,000 salary of a full-time treasurer, it would
not have enough business to keep him occupied. 'He would become bored and
tempted to play the market,' warns Pearce.
But the scope for mistakes or deliberate wrongdoing in treasury is so vast
that tight controls are necessary in any organisation. 'Problems arise when
the board does not realise what risks are being taken,' comments Leahy. 'If
the finance director or the other directors do not understand a particular
transaction, they should ask the treasurer to explain its effect on their
financial and tax position.'
Leahy advises against appointing 'a star footballer from outside who feels
he has to prove himself' but who does not understand the business. Better to
choose a senior manager from within the company and get him to recruit the
technical people, he suggests.
The smaller the treasury team the more difficult the problem of control
since there will be fewer people to oversee the work of others, says Ross.
There must be an absolute separation of the three stages of dealing,
confirmation and settlement, he advises.
Ross believes that the recent controversy over whether treasury operations
should be considered as a cost centre, merely providing services to other
parts of the company, or as a profit centre, with a mission to make profits,
really hinges on the question of control.
'People who don't understand treasury say the 'profit centre' approach
encourages speculation, but in a bigger group, it is the only way to measure
added value,' he says.
Reuters, the financial information group, aims for a middle road between the
cost and profit approaches, according to Philip Wood, director of treasury.
With 80 per cent of its revenues from outside the UK, Reuters manages its
foreign exchange exposure to avoid large fluctuations in its earnings, he
says. At the same time, it measures the success of its treasury operations
against the exchange rates laid down in its budgets. In the past two years,
treasury has made a profit of Pounds 12m.
Companies sceptical of the benefits of treasury management believe that the
creation of the European exchange rate mechanism (ERM) and the prospect of
declining interest rates will reduce its relevance. But Leahy and other
treasury specialists point out that many important trading currencies, such
as the dollar, will remain outside the ERM while there is no long-term
guarantee of cheap money.

RESULTS DUE
Welsh Water, which attracted some unwonted attention last year with results
well ahead of expectations, should announce a more muted pre-tax rise of
less than 10 per cent to about Pounds 140m for the year to March. It remains
the only water company to have a stake in a neighouring electricity company,
and that investment has shown a healthy profit. On Wednesday, Northumbrian
Water, smallest of the 10, is expected to show the most progress with a 25
to 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Pounds 60m. However, this
represents a rebuilding of margins after some heavy costs in its first year,
rather than a surge to a new level. It is still waiting the outcome of
public inquiries into plans to build waste incinerators.
The two dairy groups Unigate and Northern Foods are reporting annual profits
on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively. The contrast between the two has been
marked in recent years with Unigate's profits falling while Northern's have
climbed. These figures will see Unigate's profits beginning to rise again,
if only because it has sold loss-makers such as its chicken business.
Analysts are looking for around Pounds 90m pre-tax against Pounds 75.5m,
although there will be little underlying growth. Northern should continue to
see the benefits of heavy investment in the last few years in rising
profits, as well as a contribution from the Express Dairies and Eden Vale
businesses acquired two months before the March year end. Forecasts centre
on Pounds 125m pre-tax, up from Pounds 105.4m.
Analysts do not know what to forecast for Pilkington, the glass group, as it
has Pounds 30m to Pounds 35m of exceptional costs to cover redundancies and
the restructuring of the head office. If all these costs are taken in the
year to end March pre-tax profits could be as low as Pounds 70m, against
Pounds 151.6m, which would leave the dividend not just uncovered but under
water.
Racal Electronics, which announces annual results on Wednesday, has twice
forecast profits of about Pounds 50m pre-tax for the year to end-March,
against a Pounds 21.8m loss last time. That return will be after exceptional
provisions of about Pounds 30m for redundancies. The main interest, however,
is likely to be in details of the Chubb demerger and also whether the
recovery is still on track.
Vodaphone will be questioned closely on how it plans to cope with
lower-priced competitors preparing to enter the telecoms market when it
announces annual profits on Tuesday. Analysts are expecting pre-tax profits
of about Pounds 267m, compared with Pounds 245m, and a final dividend of 6p.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Construction Contracts: Road design
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RENDEL PALMER &amp; TRITTON has won its second roads contract in Ghana within a
few months. It has been commissioned to update earlier detailed design and
assist in letting the tender for an EC-funded project to build a new road
along an existing 54km unpaved road alignment west of Kumasi.
The road will be useful for the timber and cocoa export industries and runs
through the primary and secondary rainforest of the Brong-Ahafo region of
Western Ghana. Its sub-standard alignment and propensity to flooding renders
the road unusable at certain times of the year.
The earlier work involved evaluation and design improvements to enable the
road to accommodate higher traffic volumes and heavier lorries.

TRAFALGAR HOUSE GROUP companies have won more than Pounds 30m of work in the
last few weeks for projects at home and abroad.
In central London, Trafalgar House Construction Management has secured two
contracts together worth Pounds 18m. The Croydon-based company is to
refurbish the Willis Corroon Group's five-storey corporate headquarters at
10 Trinity Square while the client is still in occupation and without
disrupting its daily business.
At the BBC's Bush House headquarters in the Aldwych, WC2, work is underway
to upgrade the World Services studios in the central block of the north
wing. This project includes demolishing redundant studios, offices and
continuity suites and replacing them with offices, audio workshops and
studios.
The company has also been awarded the initial stages for the first phase of
a Pounds 100m residential golf community in Marbella, Spain, called Altos de
Los Monteros.
The regional business of Trafalgar House has been awarded orders worth
almost Pounds 12m for building work at HMS Heron, HMS Warrior, RAF Lyneham
and civil engineering projects in Essex, the West Country, Scotland and the
Midlands.

<TEXT>
BOVIS CONSTRUCTION, a P&amp;O Company, has been awarded a Pounds 7.6m management
contract to build and fit out a 46,500 sq ft store for Safeway on the
outskirts of Plymouth.
Bovis is breaking new ground with this project, which is being built above a
series of natural springs, requiring the installation of a special
geotextile membrane beneath the building.
Used more frequently on civil engineering projects, this is believed to be
the first time this technique has been employed to protect a building.
The membrane (which consists of one impervious and one pervious layer) will
filter the natural water as it rises, diverting it to the sides of the
store, where it will then flow into special drainage channels.
Construction work has already started to excavate the 4.5 acre site to a
depth of 12 ft in readiness for the membrane. Once it is in place, work will
start on the single-storey steel-framed structure.
The exterior of the store will feature decorative arches, clad with Blenheim
natural brick, and a flat roof finished with slate clad mansards.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Ministers hopeful on EC hours rule
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS are confident that the new uncertainty about the Maastricht treaty
makes it unlikely that the disputed working-time directive will be imposed
on the UK when employment ministers meet on June 24.
The directive, which includes the proposal for a maximum working week of 48
hours, averaged over three months, has been delayed by UK objections. It was
expected the directive would be forced through at the meeting. Britain
cannot veto it as it is being introduced under EC health and safety rules
and needs only a qualified majority.
The directive, amendments notwithstanding, is still unpopular with the
government. Department of Employment officials say the government will
either abstain or vote against at the meeting.
After the Danish referendum result, however, British ministers are more
optimistic that other EC countries which support the directive will not want
to be seen to be imposing an important measure on a recalcitrant country,
for fear of inflaming more hostility to European integration.
That means that if the directive is to be accepted at all, the UK proposal
that no worker can be forced to work more than 48 hours but may do so if he
or she wishes, will probably have to be swallowed by several countries -
particularly France - that wanted something tougher.
The Portuguese presidency of the EC is still expected to want an agreement
on the working-time directive on June 24 but will now have to ensure that it
is watered down enough for the UK not to vote against.
If that is not possible a decision may be delayed again. The UK would then
argue that the issue should be dealt with in the 'social chapter' which 11
countries, excluding the UK, agreed at Maastricht.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Eggar urges deal on coal for power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has attempted to speed the privatisation of British Coal by
increasing pressure on the electricity industry to agree a new deal with the
corporation.
After months of stagnation, there are signs that the generators and British
Coal have agreed to work towards a 'wedge-shaped' deal under which the
generators would buy about 45m tonnes of coal a year, falling to about 30m
within a few years.
That compares with the 65m tonnes the generators buy annually under
contracts that end next March. It would initially generate about 90m
kilowatt hours a year - about half the total electricity market open to the
generators.
PowerGen, one of the two large generators in England and Wales, will this
week put an offer based on that deal to the 12 English and Welsh regional
electricity supply companies. The generators will not agree to buy coal
unless they can sell the electricity it generates to the regional companies.
PowerGen, which previously seemed reluctant to agree a deal with British
Coal at all, is now understood to believe a deal can be done, although
British Coal's prices are still above world levels.
The regional electricity companies are dragging their feet, in spite of
prompting from Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister. He is understood to be
keen to secure a deal in time to put legislation for British Coal
privatisation before the Commons this autumn.
One regional company chief executive said: 'We have no reason to sign a deal
at all except a predetermined government timetable.'
The regional companies are concerned because the captive domestic market
will be liberalised progressively after 1994 and they may find themselves
with a long contract to buy coal-fired power and no customers for it.
They are also concerned that Offer, the industry regulator, might penalise
them if it proves that they could have supplied customers with cheaper
power.
National Power, the other large generator in England and Wales, recently
offered the regional companies a coal-based deal. But they said both
generators were failing to give them adequate details of the coal deal, and
are hesitant to expose themselves by signing individual contracts.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Divisions show in Scottish opposition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPPOSITION parties in Scotland presented a disunited front at the weekend. A
demonstration against the Conservatives failed to attract the degree of
support expected, and Mr Malcolm Bruce, departing leader of the Scottish
Liberal Democrats, admitted to strategic errors in the run up-to the general
election.
About 3,000 people took part in a march ending in a rally outside the Tory
party's Scottish headquarters in Edinburgh on Saturday. It was organised by
Scotland United, a fringe grouping from the non-Conservative Scottish
parties set up immediately after the general election to campaign for a
multi-option referendum on the country's constitutional future.
The attendance was no more than those of the first two Scotland United
rallies in Glasgow in April.
At a one-day conference in Dunfermline, the Scottish Liberal Democrats voted
not to join Scotland United. Instead they aim to improve the proposals for
constitutional reform worked out by the Scottish Constitutional Convention,
a grouping mainly of Labour and Liberal Democrats.
Mr Malcolm Bruce, MP for Gordon, who stepped down as Scottish leader after
the party's disappointing showing in Scotland in the election, said the
party had made a mistake in becoming too close to Labour in the convention.
'We gave Labour a respectability; we compromised on radicalism and did not
achieve advances,' he said.
Mr Jim Wallace, the MP for Orkney and Shetland who was elected party leader,
said the Liberal Democrats should develop their policy of seeking a federal
constitution for Britain which would be harder for the Conservatives to
oppose than the devolution of power to Scotland alone.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Protection of bio-diversity sparks Rio controversy: Earth
Summit suggestions about the sharing of technology have upset the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US's refusal to sign the Earth Summit treaty on biological diversity,
and the doubts expressed by other countries such as the UK and Japan, have
made this much the most controversial document at Rio. It is also one of the
more complex because it covers new areas such as patent rights on
bio-technology.
The purpose of the treaty is to create measures to protect the diversity of
plant and animal life on the planet and prevent potentially valuable species
being wiped out before they have even been discovered. Scientists estimate
that there are at least 10m species in existence, of which only 1.4m have
yet been identified, and say we are losing as many as 75 each day.
About half of the treaty consists of worthy measures which cause little
difficulty: establishing protected areas, conserving eco-systems, aiming for
sustainable development. One important principle is that all countries have
the right to exploit their bio-diversity, but must not damage the
environments of other states.
The US objection centres mainly on the section dealing with bio-technology.
In some ways it is misleading to call it simply the bio-diversity treaty.
The treaty makes clear that one of its objectives is to give all parties
access to genetic resources, and also to the technology to exploit them.
This is a tricky area because it is mainly the Third World countries which
have the bio-diversity, but the industrial countries which have the know-how
to transform it into something of commercial value.
Developing countries have been demanding access to bio-technology on
preferential terms, backed by aid from the wealthier nations. But the US, in
particular, has been resisting any suggestion that the treaty imposes a duty
on industrial countries to share their technology, or give it away.
Washington insists that the private sector, and not governments, has control
of this.
Moreover the treaty leaves open the door for countries to patent genetic
material and charge royalties for its use, thus reducing the profitability
of the multinational pharmaceutical companies which develop them into
saleable products. Mr Marcos Azambuja, Brazil's chief negotiator, says the
treaty will keep intellectual property lawyers in work for years. 'If the
bark of a tree in Piaui (a state in northern Brazil) is found to have
certain valuable properties, is that a Brazilian asset? Do we allow others
to share it and can we charge royalties if someone synthesises it?'
US worries on these issues were graphically highlighted in the leaked
memorandum which Mr William Reilly, head of the US Environmental Protection
Agency, sent to the White House last week proposing changes which might make
the treaty more acceptable.
One of the treaty clauses, for example, says countries should co-operate on
patents and intellectual property rights in both the letter of the law and
the spirit of the treaty. The US wanted the section on the spirit of the
treaty removed.
'We would have hoped that the negotiations would have confined themselves to
the issue of protecting flora and fauna,' said Mr Reilly. In fact it was the
US which was initially pushing for this treaty until it realised that it
would incorporate bio-technology as a trade-off for developing countries to
conserve their eco-systems.
Since catering to US objections would have involved re-opening the treaty -
something which is now too late - Washington has been unable to sign it even
though Brazilian President Fernando Collor implied in a speech last week
that the treaty could be later modified.
The US is the only country which has expressed these worries quite so
strongly. But Mr Reilly claims 'many countries share our fears but for their
own political reasons don't have the nerve to come out publicly and say so'.
Other countries have admitted their concern privately that the treaty
includes a 'blank cheque' which would commit the rich countries to pour
limitless technology and financial resources into the Third World.
This arises because the treaty says the amount of money needed to make it
work will be decided by a 'conference of the parties' - the signatories.
Since there are likely to be far more recipient country signatories than
donor countries, the latter could easily be outvoted.
The UK and Japan are among those worried on this score. But both are likely
to sign the treaty if it is made clear that the troublesome clause refers to
money which is needed as opposed to money which must be provided.
A further controversy arose from a French proposal that countries draw up
lists of species. Although the idea of a global catalogue is appealing, many
countries objected because they feared that once a species was put on a list
it would become protected and unexploitable. The idea was dropped, but
France has said it will continue to explore it in other ways.

THE RESULT of the Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty throws greater
doubt on the prospects for economic and monetary union. If Emu is less
likely, hopes of European monetary stability depend on the durability of the
ERM. It has survived without a general realignment for almost 5 1/2 years.
Can it continue to do so?
The underlying rationale for reliance on a fixed exchange rate as a means of
controlling inflation is 'the law of one price'. This states that goods and
services that compete closely with one another cannot sell for very
different prices. Since the proportion of the economy open to international
competition in the larger European countries would amount to about a third,
the ERM should be viewed as basically a selective price control.
Yet it appears to be an effective one. Consider producer prices, which are
the best indicator of the prices of tradable goods. The top section of the
chart shows that since January 1987, the Ecu-denominated producer prices of
Germany, France and Italy, all members of the ERM throughout that period,
have moved together closely. By contrast, those of Spain, which joined in
June 1989, and the UK, which joined in October 1990, deviated considerably,
as exchange rates shifted.
Convergence of producer prices is not an iron law, especially over shorter
periods. The small inset in the top section shows that since October 1990
producer prices have fallen by some 5 per cent in France, but risen by
slightly more than that in the UK. For the UK, this does mean a disturbing
loss of competitiveness.
A partial price control is likely to create distortions: the more effective
the price control, the more serious the distortions. Among symptoms of too
low a relative price - and so profitability - of tradable vis a vis
non-tradable output (a relationship also known as the real exchange rate)
might be a current account deficit during a recession, as in the UK today.
An indication of the shifts in the relative prices of non-tradable goods and
services vis a vis those for tradable goods and services is the movement in
consumer prices, which includes marketed services, as against producer
prices.
German producer prices in Ecus rose 12 per cent between January 1987 and
March 1992, while its consumer prices rose 16 per cent, for a relative rise
in consumer prices of only 3 per cent.
UK producer prices had risen 31 per cent by March 1992, while consumer
prices had risen 40 per cent, for a relative price rise of 7 per cent.
French producer prices had risen only 6 per cent by the last quarter of
1991, while consumer prices had risen 14 per cent, for a relative price rise
of 8 per cent.
Italian producer prices had risen 13 per cent by January 1992, while
consumer prices had risen 27 per cent, for a relative price rise of 13 per
cent. Finally,
Spanish producer prices had risen 24 per cent by February 1992, while
consumer prices had soared 52 per cent, for a relative price rise of 22 per
cent.
Judged by Ecu producer prices, the UK has suffered the largest loss of
competitiveness since 1987. But Spain, followed by Italy, has suffered from
the largest apparent distortion in its internal relative prices. Even so the
data do not demonstrate this distortion. A country with relatively high
productivity growth in tradable output would experience a sharper rise in
the relative prices of non-tradable goods and services. The same would
happen to a country with large net capital inflows.
Productivity growth is definitely not an adequate explanation for what has
happened to Italy, where productivity in manufacturing has grown more slowly
than in France and Germany in recent years. By contrast, both productivity
growth in manufacturing and capital inflows have been relatively high in
Spain.
The nominal exchange rate is just a partial price control and, like any
price control, can create internal distortions. In Italy, and perhaps Spain
as well, it seems to be doing precisely that, with ominous implications for
exchange rate stability.

FT  08 JUN 92 / World car sales to grow 1.3% in 1992
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORLD car sales are forecast to grow by 1.3 per cent to 34.6m this year
following a 2 per cent drop in 1991, which was the largest reduction in
sales since the economic recession of 1980-81.
According to DRI Europe, the UK-based automotive analysts, car sales are now
recovering in North America, the UK and Spain and remain strong in Italy and
in Latin America.
The German market is forecast to fall sharply this year, however, by around
11 per cent to 3.7m from the record 4.2m achieved last year in the wake of
reunification. Sales are also forecast to fall further in Japan.
The decline in the German market will eliminate the volume gains achieved
elsewhere in Europe leading to a 1 per cent fall in overall west European
new car sales in 1992 to 13.4m.
The DRI report is optimistic about growth in new car demand from 1993 and
beyond and forecasts a 20 per cent rise in new car sales worldwide in the
five years from 1991 to 41m in 1996.
Sales in west Europe are forecast to rise to a record 15m in 1996, while car
sales in the US are expected to rise by 4 per cent this year to 8.7m and to
more than 10m by the mid-1990s.
The downturn in Germany, the biggest single market in Europe, is forecast to
bottom out in 1993 at 3.5m, some 16 per cent or 700,000 cars below the 1991
peak with demand recovering from 1994 to reach 3.8m in 1996.
After growing by 38 per cent between 1988 and 1990 Japanese new car sales
fell by 5 per cent last year to 4.9m. The DRI report forecasts that demand
will weaken further this year by 4 per cent to 4.7m but will recover in 1993
to reach more than 5m again in 1995.
According to the DRI study new car sales in the European Community will grow
from 12.6m in 1991 to 13.9m in 1996 with Japanese car manufacturers
capturing around 30 per cent of the growth.
The Japanese share of EC car sales is forecast to rise from 10.9 per cent in
1991 to 12.5 per cent in 1996. Japanese penetration is expected to grow in
most EC markets but above all in the UK, where the Japanese share is
expected to rise from 11.6 per cent in 1991 to 16.9 per cent in 1996.
The capacity of Japanese car plants in Europe will probably exceed 700,000
units a year in 1996.
In the UK the new Nissan Micra, Toyota Carina and Honda Synchro all start
production this year. DRI forecasts that Japanese car production in the UK
will rise to more than 600,000 in 1996 pushing UK car output to 2m, which
would be 60 per cent or nearly 800,000 units above the 1991 level.
DRI says that after a weak recovery this year to 1.7m from 1.59m in 1991 new
car sales in the UK will grow more strongly in 1993 by 12 per cent to 1.9m.
The market is forecast to be above 2m again in 1994 but will not have
recovered its 1989 peak of 2.3m until 1996.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Nigeria's influential finance minister goes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIGERIA'S influential finance minister, Alhaji Abubakar Alhaji, has been
appointed high commissioner to Britain, and Mr Jibril Aminu, the oil
minister, has resigned voluntarily, the country's military government
announced at the weekend.
Nigerian officials said in Lagos last night that neither move signalled a
significant change in government policy. But they declined to elaborate on
the reasons for the changes. Initial speculation has linked the departure of
the two men with recent violence in Lagos and Kaduna, blamed partly on fuel
shortages and deteriorating economic conditions.
There have long been suggestions, however that Mr Aminu, 52, was planning to
resign and stand for president in the election scheduled for December 5, the
last stage in the phased handover to civilian rule.
He is replaced by Mr Chu Okongwu, a former budget and planning minister and
currently minister for special duties.
More striking is the move to London by 'Triple A', the widely used nickname
for the former finance minister, who is succeeded by Mr Ahmed Abubakar, the
Finance Ministry's director general (permanent secretary).
It would be uncharacteristic of him to treat the job as a sinecure,
associates said yesterday, noting that he would be well placed to follow
Nigeria's talks with western creditors. But they added that it seemed
unlikely that he could exercise the same influence on policy making.
A former permanent secretary and minister of budget and planning, he became
increasingly influential after General Ibrahim Babangida seized power in
1985.
Triple A played a leading role in the implementation of the country's
structural adjustment programme. With a combination of belligerence and
charm, a shrewd understanding of western financial institutions, and a
disarming capacity to quote from the classics of English literature, he won
an international reputation as a formidable negotiator in his dealings with
the International Monetary Fund (IMF), and in rescheduling Nigeria's
external debt to government and commercial bank creditors.
He also emerged as a powerful but controversial figure in the politics of
Nigeria's mainly Moslem north. With Gen Babangida's backing, he was
installed last year as the Sardauna of Sokoto, entrenching his leading
position in the Moslem hierarchy.
His popularity within Nigeria has steadily diminished as economic hardship
increased, the state's financial management deteriorated, and the Babangida
government faced allegations of widespread corruption.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Suharto party's majority set to slip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA goes to the polls tomorrow to elect a new parliament with the
ruling Golkar party, in power since its formation in 1971, certain to win
but probably with a reduced majority. Nevertheless the make-up of the
parliament will be an important indication of President Suharto's popularity
in the run-up to presidential elections next March.
In the last election in 1987 Golkar won 73 per cent of the vote and the
officials of the two opposition parties, the Indonesian Democratic Party
(PDI) and the United Development Party (PPP), admit they have no chance of
power.
The parliament has little effective control over the presidency. Since
President Suharto assumed power in 1965, the parliament has neither
initiated, nor blocked, a single piece of legislation.
The 400 members elected tomorrow will be joined by 100 members nominated by
the armed forces.
Nevertheless, the month-long election campaign has not been devoid of
incident. Last week the PDI, which won 11 per cent of the vote in 1987 and
which has its roots in the nationalist movement of former President Sukarno,
mobilised up to 3m supporters, out of a 100m electorate, at a rally in
Jakarta.
The rules of the campaign, however, have restricted hard political dialogue.
Parties are not allowed to campaign on religious issues, which has made life
difficult for the PPP, an amalgam of Islamic groups which took 16 per cent
of the vote in the last election.
Other banned topics include the dominant role of the small ethnic-Chinese
community in the economy, and anything which might question national unity.
Mr Witoelar argues that public debate of sensitive issues would invite
political instability, even a re-run of 1965 when up to 500,000 people were
killed in the aftermath of a failed communist coup.
One issue that has broken through has been alleged nepotism within
government, and criticism of the business interests of President Suharto's
children. Two of his sons run companies which enjoy monopoly rights over
buying and selling certain farm produce.
Golkar supporters are preparing themselves for a reduction in their
majority, perhaps to 68 per cent. A fall below that figure would embarrass
President Suharto in advance of the presidential elections in which he is
expected to stand for a sixth five-year term.
The question of who could succeed the 71-year-old president is itself
becoming a sensitive issue. President Suharto has in the past attracted
all-party support for his nomination, but the PDI has suggested it might put
forward an alternative candidate.
Although his re-election should still be guaranteed - the presidential
electoral college includes all members of parliament, plus another 500
members chosen by the president - much will depend upon the support of
senior army officers with which the president has not always agreed.

FT  08 JUN 92 / G7 summit set to streamline supply of expertise to eastern
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year's Group of Seven economic summit in Munich will be asked to
approve the creation of special co-ordination groups to improve the supply
of western expertise to the former communist countries of eastern Europe and
the former Soviet Union, write Peter Norman and Quentin Peel in Bonn.
Mr Horst Kohler, the German government sherpa, or official, preparing next
month's summit, said the states could no longer cope with the different
advice and technical assistance supplied by western states.
He told the Financial Times that the G7 sherpas, representing the US, Japan,
Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada, had already reached broad
agreement for the summit to give the go-ahead to so-called country
co-ordination groups to aid each of the emerging market economies.
These would link the efforts of the International Monetary Fund, the World
Bank and possibly the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development with
those of interested western countries to ensure that macro- and
micro-economic advice is better co-ordinated, and to eliminate some of the
overlap and competition among western countries providing assistance. This
would also give the G7 something to offer Russian President Boris Yeltsin,
who will join the G7 leaders for talks after the summit.
The main goal of the summit, which runs from July 6 to 8, will be to boost
the confidence of western businesses and consumers and foster economic
recovery. Mr Kohler said Germany, as the host country, was keen developing
countries should not be left out of this process.
He said the summit would not institutionalise a new north-south dialogue.
But there were many areas of shared interest between the industrial and
developing countries, ranging from the environment, through economic growth,
to combating the drugs trade and controlling immigration and epidemics. The
prospects for more fruitful contacts had increased since the collapse of
communism and the increased adoption of market economics and ideas of good
governance in the developing world.
The proposed focus on north-south relationships would give leaders a break
from issues which could make the summit one of the more acrimonious G7
gatherings.
The still-faltering state of world growth, Germany's high interest rates and
the problems it is facing in absorbing the new eastern Lander, the
possibility that the Uruguay Round of trade liberalisation talks will stay
stalled until after November's US presidential election and the difficulties
surrounding the former Soviet Union's emergence from communist dictatorship
have set the scene for a meeting where there will be no easy answers.
The sherpas have so far failed to reach agreement on one important summit
issue: how best to make safe the nuclear power stations of the former east
bloc. 'We are not going to solve all the problems of the world at a stroke.
It could be a failure,' Mr Kohler admits.
However, Germany is doing its utmost to make the summit a success. For
example, Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, has brought forward by two
weeks the deadline for finalising next year's federal budget, to show that
Germany is earnest about cutting the fiscal deficits caused by unification.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Milosevic fails to convince he is powerless: Observers
believe the Serbian leader does have authority over forces in Bosnia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Cedric Thornberry, the United Nations mediator in the besieged Bosnian
capital of Sarajevo, is pinning all his hopes on the coming days.
Following lengthy negotiations between the Bosnian presidency and Serb
militia groups at the weekend, an agreement was reached to reopen Sarajevo
airport.
As long as the airport remains blocked by the Serb forces, the more likely
the people of Sarajevo will die of starvation. Its remaining 300,000
inhabitants have been without food, water, electricity and medicine, after
Serb forces started bombarding and besieging the city nine weeks ago.
Mr Thornberry wants UN troops to take control of the airport, as well as the
surrounding areas. But any successful implementation of this plan depends on
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic.
In an attempt to distance himself from the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina so
as to end the UN sanctions imposed on Serbia a week ago, Mr Milosevic claims
he no longer controls the forces in Bosnia. Few experienced UN or western
diplomats in Belgrade believe him. They say the fighting in Bosnia could be
reduced if the Serbian president chose to call in the Serbian commanders who
control large sections of that war-torn republic.
These commanders are located in four key centres: Sarajevo; Pale, which is
close to the capital; Banja Luka in the north-east; and Tuzla, in the east
of Bosnia.
In Sarajevo, Mr Milosevic's hand-picked man is General Ratko Mladic.
Formerly Yugoslav army commander in the self-proclaimed Serbian republic of
Krajina, south-western Croatia, he was appointed head of the Yugoslav army
in Sarajevo by Mr Milosevic in early May. A few days later, he was made
chief of Serbia's proxy Bosnian army.
Since then, along with Mr Radovan Karadzic, leader of Bosnia's Serb
Democratic party (the sister party of Mr Milosevic's ruling Serbian
Socialist party), General Mladic has ruthlessly tried to starve Sarajevo
into submission.
Through siege and bombardment, he and Mr Karadzic, whose headquarters is now
in Pale, want to divide the city's ethnically-mixed, but close-knit,
community into separate Croat, Moslem and Serb districts.
To the north-west, in the 195,000-strong city of Banja Luka, a Serbian
stronghold, a more insidious campaign to create ethnically-pure Serb regions
is under way. A special 'Centre for Migration', organised by Mr Brdjanin
Kuprasanin and Mr Radislav Vukic, has been set up to administer the transfer
of populations.
For example, Mr Kuprasanin recently demanded that the mayor of Zenica, a
city in central Bosnia, swap 30,000 Moslems and Croats from Banja Luka for
Serbs from Zenice. Before the fighting, Banja Luka was 55 per cent Serb, 15
per cent Croat, and 15 per cent Moslem. Zenica was 55 per cent Moslem, 15
per cent Serb and 15 per cent Croat.
Moslems refusing to move out of their homes are forced to, or are killed.
When they try to flee, the men are often picked out of the convoys and shot.
A bus driver, involved in bringing some of the 200 refugees from the eastern
Bosnian town of Visegrad, recounted last week how Serb militia forces on the
Serbian border turned back the convoy into Bosnia. The Serbs then stopped
the bus, picked out 17 Moslems and shot them dead.
In Tuzla, Serb forces led by Mr Mile Dubajic began bombarding the
131,000-strong city two weeks ago with the aim of driving out all non-Serbs,
and consolidating that swathe of territory between Serbia proper and Tuzla.
Over 47 per cent of the city is Moslem.
Like other Serb commanders, Mr Dubajic has no respect for UN or other relief
agencies. He told a senior international aid agency official that if he
returned to the city, he would be shot personally by Mr Dubajic. 'They don't
want us around because they don't want us to see the atrocities,' said a UN
official.
Away from the main centres of fighting, UN and diplomatic military personnel
returning from other regions in Bosnia explained how Serb and Croatian
forces were driving out innocent civilians from villages through a policy of
pillage, burning, and killing.
'In remote areas, Croats and Serbs are doing their own forms of ethnic
cleansing in such a way that refugees who want to come home will have
nothing to come home to,' a senior UN official explained.
In regions around the south-western city of Mostar in Hercegovina, Croat
forces under the command of Mr Slobodan Praljak, Croatia's assistant defence
minister, have forced thousands of Serb villagers to flee into neighbouring
Montenegro. UN officials say Croatian President Franjo Tudjman is using the
international spotlight on Serbia to advance Croatia's own aims by trying to
annex Hercegovina to Croatia.
But they still insist that Mr Milosevic has the authority to order the siege
of Sarajevo and its airport to be lifted, and the power to rein in General
Mladic, Mr Karadzic and Serb militia groups.
A senior western diplomat said: 'If Milosevic says he has nothing more to do
with Bosnia, why doesn't he prove it by halting all oil and money sent from
Serbia to the army in Bosnia, and removing General Mladic?' He added:
'Maybe, in his cynical and cowardly way, Milosevic will do it when Sarajevo
has been completely destroyed.'

FT  08 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: EC ministers to pursue single
market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER and CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS, BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EC finance ministers meeting in Luxembourg tomorrow will try to give the
impression of business-as-usual, despite uncertainty over the future of the
Maastricht treaty, by advancing measures to create next year's single
market.
Ministers will have their first formal look at Spain's 'convergence'
programme, under provisions whereby the 12 examine each member state's
efforts to prepare for economic and monetary union (Emu), by converging
their fiscal and monetary performance towards targets set by Maastricht.
Following Denmark's rejection of the treaty last week, this increasingly
important exercise in mutual bullying will be watched more closely by
markets anxious about whether Emu and a single currency are now feasible by
the target dates of 1997, or 1999 at the latest.
Ministers will also have their first serious discussion on the European
Commission's plans to increase EC revenue by more than 30 per cent from now
to 1997. This increase partly flows from Maastricht pledges to increase
fiscal transfers to Spain, Portugal, Ireland and Greece, the Community's
poorest members.
The size of the increase is hotly opposed by Germany and the UK, the EC's
two biggest net contributors. But if the EC tips itself into a further
argument about money, the prospects of ratifying Maastricht could be clouded
further. The most potent weapon of the Irish government, for instance, which
is holding a referendum on June 18, is EC cash.
The finance ministers will also continue the EC's increasingly controversial
efforts to persuade the UK to harmonise its value added tax rates with the
rest of the Community as part of the single market.
Christopher Parkes adds from Bonn: Chancellor Helmut Kohl said yesterday EC
leaders would agree to accelerate the pace of enlargement at their next
summit in Lisbon later this month.
'The train will not stop,' he added in a robust response to the Danish
referendum's 'no' to political and monetary union. 'We want to step up the
pace rather than slow it down,' he said in a radio interview.

FT  08 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Cosmopolitan mix keeps support
for European unity alive - Saint-Denis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE spirit of Maastricht is alive and well
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
on the surface, at least - among the many races and creeds milling around
the market in Saint-Denis on the northern outskirts of Paris.
Saint-Denis has an incongruous mix. It is one of France's most cosmopolitan
towns; Corsicans, Arabs, Poles and Africans mill through the streets. The
kings and queens of France lie buried inside the town's single-tower Gothic
cathedral. The town hall is run by the Communist party, which believes the
Maastricht treaty is an affront to national freedom. One in four of the
town's residents vote for the extreme right-wing National Front, whose
leader Jean-Marie Le Pen is France's chief anti-Maastricht campaigner. And
yet, on the evidence of the market-place, Saint-Denis is decidedly
pro-European.
The Danish vote against Maastricht has made almost no impact on 10 French
nationals picked at random from this colourful gathering.
Half of them were of foreign extraction - proof of France's tradition of
assimilating people of different cultures. Seven of the 10 said they would
definitely vote for Maastricht in the referendum announced by President
Francois Mitterrand on Wednesday, one said no and two had not made up their
minds.
'Anything that moves to a single Europe is good,' says Mr Hamadache Arezki,
39, a trader selling billowy underwear to Saint Denis' larger ladies. Mr
Arezki considers himself badly informed on the details of Maastricht, and
then reels off most of the main points with startling expertise. Algerian by
origin, Mr Arezki thinks of himself as French.
The National Front and the Communists won a combined 50 per cent of the vote
in regional elections held in March, so it is surprising to find so many
people in the streets confessing to be pro-European.
Mr Le Pen's supporters blame immigrants - 28.5 per cent of Saint Denis'
population is foreign - for the 14 per cent unemployment rate, four points
above the national norm. Saint Denis is also poor; nearly half its
households have no car and a quarter have no bathroom, toilet or central
heating, according to a study by the town hall.
Perhaps the town's non-Europeans think the EC will improve their lot, while
the anti-Europeans want to defend their livelihoods against a possible
increase in immigration. Significantly, the only firm anti-Maastricht voter
in the FT's straw poll was of French origin.
Mrs Francoise Dauphet, a middle-aged woman who works in a clothes shop,
says: 'I'm glad the Danes said no. Perhaps the single European currency is a
good idea. But opening the frontiers is bad. There are already too many
immigrants in Saint-Denis and too much unemployment.'
Mrs Dauphet, who says she votes for the neo-Gaullist opposition, adds: 'Look
what happened when Germany let down the wall. We don't want that here.'
A young French girl, sitting at the information desk in the nearby town
hall, claims never to have heard of Maastricht, let alone its treaty. In any
case, questions on Europe's future are not her business and should be
addressed to the electoral office she says, a reflex which shows typical
French belief that the public administration knows everything.
The office is run by Mr Philippe Chartier, a polite, bespectacled
26-year-old, who agrees that average French people are not well enough
informed on the content of the Maastricht treaty, and have lazily left the
subject to their respected administration.
Public ignorance may have contributed to the Danish problem, he says, adding
that this factor might have been underestimated by the French government.
'French people tend to see Maastricht as a source of conflict between
political parties, rather than for what it is,' he says. Mr Chartier
believes that voters will view the Maastricht referendum as much as a chance
to express a view on the increasingly unpopular Mitterrand presidency as on
the treaty. The referendum could thus backfire.
'Even so, I think only four out of 10 in France will say no,' he says.
Back in the street, a surprising number of locals talk about the need for
Europeans to band together against perceived US domination. Mr Bernard
Mascheroni, 61, a part-time landscape painter, sips black coffee in a bar as
he argues 'European union will make us all stronger, so that the EC can
resist US imperialism'.
The threat to national identity is a marginal problem for a multiracial
district like Saint Denis, he points out. 'The Danes might be right,' echoes
the barwoman, Mrs Chantale Monetti, who does not know how she will vote.
The painter's fear of the US is echoed by Mr Albert Baum, 67, a Polish
tailor, who adds that the EC should try to imitate a US federal system.
'It's not a perfect model, I know, but it works,' he says. Mr Baum would be
happy to pay his bills in Ecu, rather than francs.
'The Danes have got it all wrong. You can't make a European union and
completely satisfy everyone. This is the problem of Europe and they have to
accept that,' says Mr Baum.
Like others he fears the average Frenchman or woman is not well enough
informed to vote rationally on Maastricht. 'People will just vote on what
they are told.'

FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and The Family: Maxwell - the heat grows / As
pension victims prepare to march, Norma Cohen reports on the drive for
justice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON MONDAY, thousands of pensioners will march on the House of Commons to try
to force a political solution to a commercial disaster that has effectively
deprived many of them of their life savings. They are members of various
schemes controlled by the late Robert Maxwell, and are the victims of an
apparent fraud which occurred almost unnoticed by the myriad professional
advisers and trustees whose job it was to protect scheme assets.
'Citizens have the right to expect their savings to be safeguarded by
government,' says Kenneth Trench, chairman of the Maxwell Pensioners' Action
Group. Trench, who describes many members of his organisation as being 'on
the precipice of poverty,' claims the government has an obligation to
provide compensation to pensioners because regulators failed to spot and
halt Maxwell's activities.
At least Pounds 400m is missing from the pension funds, leaving some Pounds
295m left to pay the pensions of 32,700 scheme members, around 14,000 of
whom have retired already. Beginning next month, about half the 10,000
members of one of the schemes, the Maxwell Communications works scheme, will
have their monthly cheques cut by 70 per cent. Former workers at CJ Arnold,
a Leeds printing company, have already had their entire pensions stopped.
More than 100 employees who have retired from Maxwell Communications
Corporation since February cannot get any pension and that number is
increasing monthly. The most fortunate scheme members are those at Mirror
Group Newspapers, which has said it will try to make up the shortfall with
annual contributions.
But more than 500 employees of British International Helicopters, acquired
by Maxwell from the then government-owned British Airways, will lose their
payments. He had transferred them to the MGN scheme, but MGN says it will
not pay pensions to another company's employees. Since March, one former
captain has retired and others are due soon to follow suit.
Those acting for the pensioners estimate it would cost Whitehall between
Pounds 400,000 and Pounds 500,000 a month to make up payments. MPs with
Maxwell pensioners in their constituencies are urging a government financial
'drip-feed' to those affected while efforts are made to track down and
secure assets taken from the schemes.
Since the pension funds' missing assets were discovered in December,
solicitors, professional trustees, accountants and actuaries have jumped
into the fray with an energy not visible before Maxwell drowned off the
Canary Islands. But the pensioners have just discovered one of the home
truths about hiring professionals: the cost.
Trench says the bill between December 5 1991 and March 3 1992 - all from the
funds' scarce assets - was around Pounds 3.5m. This money can no longer be
used to pay pensions as, legally, advisers' bills must be settled before any
benefits are distributed.
'These bills include 17 1/2 per cent VAT,' Trench notes, 'so the government
is taking a cut of our pensions, too.'
Lawyers for the pensioners concede privately that the legal arguments for
government compensation are weak. Because no government department has
statutory obligations to oversee pensions, it is difficult to point to any
one division and argue that it failed in its duties to protect citizens.
which might have had some responsiblity is Imro, the self-regulatory body
for the fund management industry which authorised the Maxwell-owned fund
manager - Bishopsgate Investment Management - to invest the pension assets
of sister companies. But Imro's charter prevents it from being sued for
negligence.
The whole situation has exercised the minds of a cross-party select
parliamentary committee on social security. In March it issued a report
calling for pension law reforms. These include giving more muscle to the
Occupational Pensions Board.
It also called for changes to the law which gives great discretion to
pension fund boards of trustees, and asked the government to establish a
top-ranking committee to review pension law generally - a proposal to be
adopted by the government when it announces the setting-up of a commission
on Monday.
But if the legal case for aid is weak, lawyers argue that the moral case is
very strong. 'The role of government is to protect the defenceless,' says
Richard Thomas, independent trustee for the MCC pension scheme and a
director of Law Debenture Corporation.
Unlike the investors entitled to compensation under the Investors'
Compensation Scheme, Maxwell's pensioners never made any decision to invest
funds. Indeed, up until 1988, they were required by law to contribute a
portion of their salary every year to an occupational pension scheme if
their employer sponsored one. Until 1986, they were not entitled to ask how
those funds were being invested and present law, which requires schemes to
provide information to members, has no mechanism to force compliance.
Thus, in attempting to learn lessons for scheme members from the tragedy of
Maxwell's pensioners, it is difficult to point to steps which could have
been taken by individuals to protect themselves. Those who try to avoid
being defrauded by opting out into personal schemes risk losing benefits
provided by many employers - and are likely to pay heavy administrative
costs which could reduce final payments.
The only lesson, it seems, is for pension scheme members to urge MPs to
adopt a new, safer pensions act.

FT  06 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's announcement by Offer, the electricity regulator, confirmed that
the market in second-hand UK power stations will be a limited affair. The
two generators feared the forced introduction of competitive tendering for
stations marked for closure because that would have encouraged the
persistence of overcapacity. In the event, by merely keeping an option to
appoint independent consultants, Offer seems to have accepted the
probability that there will be few, if any, bidders for plant which the
generators have already written off as uneconomic. The transparency
introduced in the form of individual power plant forecasts scarcely seems
the key to bringing in new entrants either.
All the same, Offer has removed a little of the uncertainty surrounding the
generators in the run-up to the forthcoming deal over future contracts with
British Coal. The timing of that remains obscure, although signs earlier
this week that the regional electricity companies are gradually being
brought into line by the government suggest there may not be much longer to
wait. Whatever the regional companies say publicly, it seems certain that
they will be able to buy electricity more cheaply. The question is by how
much. Until the deal is announced, the generators' shares will doubtless
mark time, not least because they have outperformed the market by nearly 9
per cent in the last month.

FT  06 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Euro Disney
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Not all Disney rides are rewarding or exhilarating, as shareholders who
failed to jump off in recent weeks are discovering to their cost. Yesterday
they were treated to another uncomfortable bump as Euro Disney fell 5 per
cent in Paris. Walt Disney, its US parent with a 49 per cent stake, is now 7
per cent below its Wednesday close.
The latest source of concern is Thursday's half year report, which does
little to allay market fears that attendances since the grand opening have
been worse than hoped. Judging by the first seven weeks, it seems most
unlikely the company will meet its first year goal of 11m visits. Taken with
the decision to delay opening of the second phase and doubts about whether
or not there will be profits in the current year, this certainly suggests
the sceptics have a point.
That said, those who have held their nerve so far should sit it out. It is
foolish to rely too much on the extrapolation of early trends. It is also
worth remembering that consumer spending in France has been weak in April
and May. After so much Disney hype, there is no point in succumbing to
excessive Disney gloom.

<TEXT>
TI's bid for Dowty looks a closer call than at first appeared. When it was
launched, no one expected Dowty to be declaring profits of Pounds 33m for
1991-92. But if the bid, worth 193p at last night's close, looks less
generous than before, that does not change the fundamentals.
Dowty has reaped an early harvest from its restructuring, but there must be
doubts about the continuing pace of improvement, especially in electronics.
The company has given no details of its order book and was forced yesterday
by the Takeover Panel to dissociate itself from market estimates of sharply
higher profits this year. Even at Pounds 45m pre-tax, Dowty would be trading
on an expensive forward multiple of 16. Investors who side with TI may
sacrifice some running yield, but their chances of capital appreciation
would increase. TI brings scope for higher margins and a better chance of
selling the loss-making Cognito venture.

FT  06 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Lloyds blinks first
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At least the choice facing Midland investors is now simple: whether, with
Lloyds out of the game, they should accept Hongkong Bank's offer. The
chances are a majority will do so. Midland's shares may have closed
yesterday some 6 per cent below the HSBC bid value. But that is natural for
a paper offer whose value will fluctuate with the hugely volatile Hong Kong
stock market till it closes on June 25.
The more awkward question is where Lloyds goes from here. Its chief
executive, Mr Brian Pitman, has gone to extraordinary lengths to persuade
the City that a partnership with Midland was the best way forward. Now he
looks uncharacteristically bereft of direction. Few predators would pull out
of a deal only hours after they received special permission from the
government to buy shares in the market. Not to have foreseen the price
required to stay in the game smacks of naivete, to say the least.
There is perhaps a mitigating factor. In deciding to pull back, Mr Pitman
was true to his long-standing aim of maximising shareholder value. The
mathematics can never be precise, but there may be something in the argument
that at a price of say 520p, Midland shareholders would have been handed an
unfair share of the merger benefits. If so, Lloyds did right by its own
investors, especially given the chance of the MMC imposing conditions on the
deal.
Many would argue, however, that there was something left for Lloyds'
shareholders even at the higher price. That leaves the nagging suspicion
that Lloyds also felt under pressure to pull back because its persistence
had antagonised the authorities. The abiding memory will be of its strategic
mistake in embarking on an exercise which, thanks partly to the early
publicity it attracted, acquired a momentum of its own. One has to hope that
Lloyds will conduct itself with greater circumspection in the future,
especially as it has surplus capital to burn.
As long as it sticks by its commitment to shareholder value, there is little
chance of Lloyds switching to an alternative target like the TSB or the
Royal Bank of Scotland. Nor would it necessarily suffer from sitting tight.
Higher shareholders' funds would reduce the bank's return on equity. But
Lloyds would have the capacity to raise market share if other banks ran into
capital constraints as a result of bad debt provisions.
A high capital ratio should also be good for its share price to the extent
that it promises dividend security through the next recession. Indeed, the
biggest danger might not be that Mr Pitman will risk his reputation again.
It could be that he will now bring forward his retirement and hand over to a
successor who will try to succeed on the acquisition trail where he has
failed.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Kohl and Major urge faster EC enlargement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr John Major, the UK prime minister,
called yesterday for a speedier widening of European Community membership,
in spite of Denmark's vote to reject the Maastricht treaty on European
union.
The joint call, issued after informal talks in Bonn, gives German backing to
Mr Major's push for a rapid enlargement of the Community.
In particular, the two leaders called for negotiations with prospective
member states from the seven-nation European Free Trade Area (Efta) to begin
at the start of 1993.
The push for faster EC enlargement is seen in Bonn as a way of playing down
the significance of Denmark's referendum result, which threatens to sabotage
the Maastricht agreement on European economic, monetary and political union.
In the House of Commons, the UK government's balancing act over the EC was
highlighted by Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, who attacked the 'seemingly
endless and unquestioning pressure' from Brussels for an extension of the
Community's competence.
Mr Lamont said the Danish vote provided a timely reminder that there was
'nothing inevitable or predetermined about the future development of the
EC'.
His implicit criticism of Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president, will
strike a chord with many Tory MPs.
Describing their talks in Bonn as 'very friendly', Mr Major and Mr Kohl
welcomed the outcome of the meeting on Thursday of EC foreign ministers. The
ministers had insisted that the other 11 member states press ahead with
ratification of an unchanged Maastricht treaty by the end of the year, but
leave the door open for Denmark to reconsider its position.
While emphasising the commitment to press ahead with ratification, the two
leaders believe that more work needs to be done on how the Community can
move forward before this can sensibly be discussed by European heads of
government, who will meet at the Lisbon summit in three weeks.
The UK legislation to ratify the treaty is almost certain not to come back
to the House of Commons before July. This leaves the UK parliament with
little prospect of completing its consideration in the time agreed by EC
foreign ministers.
Mr Major and Mr Kohl called for 'speedy initiation and conduct of
negotiations on accession with those Efta states which so desire', urging
the Commission to produce a negotiating mandate by the time of the EC summit
in Edinburgh in December.
The move is regarded with suspicion by some member states, including France,
which believe 'deepening' of the Community via the Maastricht treaty is an
essential precondition.
They fear new members will delay the integration process. So far, Austria,
Finland, Sweden and Switzerland have applied to join.
At the Anglo-German talks yesterday, Mr Major apparently failed to persuade
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, to modify his objections to the
European Fighter Aircraft project.
Mr Ruhe did agree to further talks with Mr Malcolm Rifkind, his British
counterpart, before reaching a final decision. The parties in Germany's
ruling coalition are due to decide the fate of the aircraft on June 23.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Uproar at Earth Summit over US memo leak
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US, already branded as the villain of the Earth Summit, was deeply
embarrassed yesterday by a leaked memorandum to the White House about an
attempt to 'fix' one of the central documents before the conference.
The memo, written by Mr William Reilly, the administrator of the US
Environment Protection Agency and leader of the US delegation, created a
diplomatic uproar and provided stark evidence of the divisions within the US
administration over the summit.
It was sent to the White House in an attempt to persuade the administration
to soften its opposition to a key treaty to protect the 'biological
diversity' of plant and animal life on the planet.
But the language Mr Reilly used, and a reference to the involvement of
Brazil in behind-the-scenes moves, caused it to backfire.
The memo, copies of which were circulated to the press in Rio, begins: 'As I
indicated last night, Brazil has offered to try and fix the biodiversity
convention so that the US could sign it. I have serious doubt whether the
Brazilians can get others to accept a fix, but I have indicated a
willingness to let them try.'
The memo went on to suggest wording that might have been acceptable to the
US. But it also pointed out that the chances of success were remote because
the wording of the treaty had already been agreed. The document was being
signed last night.
Mr Reilly defended the memo as an attempt to explore all possibilities even
though it was unlikely that a fix could be reached before the deadline.
He added: 'It is most unfortunate that someone within our government chose
to leak information about these most important efforts - efforts that
demanded diplomatic discretion.'
Senator Albert Gore, chairman of the US Senate delegation to the conference,
described the debacle as 'unfortunate', and hit out at hardliners in the
Bush administration.
Referring to the White House refusal to agree to Mr Reilly's
recommendations, Mr Gore said: 'Once again, the principal official in charge
of US environmental policy has been overruled and this time the world is
watching.'
The decisions of the executive branch were 'hurting the ability of the US to
provide leadership,' he added.
The incident was also embarrassing for Brazil which, as host, desperately
wants a successful conference. Mr Celso Lafer, the Brazilian foreign
minister, said there had 'never been any attempt at a fix. We have been
having informal contacts with all delegations.'
Now the treaty is being signed, it is too late for further diplomatic
initiatives, even if there is the will.
However, Brazilian President Fernando Collor, who was the first to sign the
treaty, seemed to imply the possibility of a later revision of the
convention, which he described as the first step in a long road. Officials
said there might be a side commitment to revise the treaty at the earliest
opportunity.
Britain and Japan are both expected to sign the treaty next week, leaving
the US isolated in opposition.

FT  06 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow recovers after losses on
jobs data
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
SHARE PRICES fell in early trading yesterday as investors reacted to a
disappointing May employment report, but a late recovery saw almost all of
the initial losses recouped by the close, writes Patrick Harverson in New
York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down just 1.04 at
3,398.69, compared to its lows for the day when the index had been down more
than 20 points. The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 ended up 0.21
at 413.47, while the Nasdaq composite fell 2.83 to 585.43. Turnover on the
NYSE was 199m shares. The May employment figures provided an unexpected
shock - a smaller-than-expected 68,000 jump in non-farm payroll jobs and a
rise in the unemployment rate from 7.3 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
Although the Labor Department said that the increase was primarily due to a
rise in the number of people registering to look for work, the market had
not been expecting any change in the headline rate, and share prices went
into an immediate decline.
The good news was the reaction of the bond market to the jobs figures, which
led to higher bond prices, and lower yields, as hopes rose that the poor
state of the labour market would persuade the Federal Reserve to cut
interest rates again.
Among individual stocks, Reebok International plunged Dollars 4 3/8 to
Dollars 23 1/2 in turnover of 3.6m shares after the sportshoe manufacturer
announced late on Thursday that its second quarter net income would fall to
a range of 49 to 53 cents a share, from 64 cents a share in the same quarter
of 1991.
Du Pont eased Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 51 3/8 in active trading after the
company disclosed it would take a charge in the second quarter to cover
product recall costs. The stock was also damaged by a cut in its earnings
estimates by Salomon Brothers.
Walt Disney fell Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 in turnover of 3m shares as
investors continued to react negatively to news from Euro Disney, the theme
park near Paris half-owned by the US entertainment group.
Although the latest attendance figures were not disappointing, Euro Disney
announced that the opening of a second park would be put back a year and
that the company might not make a profit in its first year.
Albany International dropped Dollars 2 to Dollars 15 1/8 on the news that
company expects to break even, or possibly record a slight loss in the
second quarter because of a 7 per cent decline in sales.
First Chicago firmed Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 34 in turnover of 2.8m after a
public offering of 8m shares of the bank's common stock was completed
successfully at a price of Dollars 32.75 a share.
Canada
TORONTO closed lower in moderate trading. The composite index fell 10.86
points to 3,392.56. For the week, the index rose about 4.5 points. Advances
led declines 276 to 260. Volume was 23.9m shares and trading value was
CDollars 269.1m against CDollars 325.6m.

FT  06 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy selling of Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONCE AGAIN, Midland Bank dominated trading as prospective bidder Lloyds
decided the price it would have to offer was too high and withdrew from the
contest, leaving the field open to Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation
(HSBC).
Midland, which had been firm earlier, fell sharply on the news as
arbitrageurs bailed out of the stock. The shares closed 21 off at 446p with
33m traded. The closing price was well below the current HSBC offer price,
worth around 474p. However, Hong Kong was closed for a public holiday
yesterday and, in unofficial trading in London, HSBC shares fell HKDollars
1.
There was widespread disappointment at Lloyds' decision. The market thought
that, at the very least, Lloyds would await a decision by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission before pulling out, and would at best produce a firm
offer, well in excess of 500p for each Midland share. The shock was even
greater among the arbitrageurs, who are believed to have taken a big
position in Midland when the Kuwait Investment Office sold its 10.5 per cent
stake (60m shares) in April, and were keen to get rid of it yesterday.
Sellers were shifting into TSB and Royal Bank of Scotland in the hope that
they would now attract Lloyds' attention. However, one analyst said that,
after trying for both Standard Chartered and Midland, Lloyds was unlikely to
attempt a third hostile bid for some time. TSB rose 4 to 151p, Royal Bank of
Scotland reversed an earlier loss to close a penny better at 202p. Lloyds
recovered from being 17 off to close a penny better at 436p.
Generators busy
Power generators showed some muscle after Prof Stephen Littlechild,
director-general of electricity supply, published the long-delayed licence
conditions for the industry. National Power gained 2 1/2 to 245p and
PowerGen put on 2 to 254p, following licence changes that will make little
difference and, according to Ms Rachel Lucas at County NatWest, should be
greeted by the generators with delight.
Under the changes, the companies must announce criteria for planning plant
availability, closing power stations or reducing their capacity, as well as
to forecast output.
PowerGen said the moves will improve transparency in the trading pool and
add to customer confidence.
Ms Lucas said that the outcome was benign, but not unexpected. She also
believed that a forthcoming deal with British Coal is likely to be
favourable for the power industry. At the same time, it was suggested in the
market that the government is putting pressure on the regional electricity
companies to sign supply agreements with the generators.
Rank upset
Leisure group Rank Organisation suffered a double hit of downgradings
yesterday which sent the shares into retreat and turnover climbing.
The shares gave up 11 to 746p after Smith New Court weighed in with a
profits downgrading. Joining securities houses that recently reduced
forecasts, Smith cut the current-year figure by Pounds 15m to Pounds 260m
and the following year's figure by the same amount to Pounds 330m. The
broker blamed continued weakness in consumer spending for the reduction, and
has now moved the stock from a hold to a trading sell.
Sentiment was further weakened by news from the US that securities house
Dean Whitter had reduced its earnings estimate for Xerox Corp, the company
with whom Rank jointly owns Rank Xerox, a substantial profits contributor to
the UK company. Turnover had risen to 3.6m by the close.
Euro Disney fall
Euro Disney tumbled 60 to 1103p after the company said in a letter to share
holders on Thursday that it could not guarantee it would show a profit in
the 12 months to September 1992. The company also said it had yet to gain
approval from its partners on the second phase of the resort.
Oils bucked a weak market to push ahead in line with higher oil prices a
stronger US oil market, raised demand forecasts and broker enthusiasm.
Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken was a buyer of BP, highlighting a report from the
International Energy Agency which raised its forecast for oil demand growth
in 1992. BP improved 4 1/2 to 275 1/2 p in heavy turnover of 16m shares.
Shell Transport was helped by Smith New Court which featured it at its
morning conference. The shares lifted 7 to 519p.
Wellcome fell 13 to 945p in response to a US press report which raised
doubts about the forthcoming share flotation, arguing that the shares were
at a premium which could deter buyers.
The world's largest mining group, RTZ, gained 7 to 627p on hopes of economic
recovery and in line with copper price rises.
Currency factors and news that Reuters had made an ADollars 59m (Pounds
24.7m) out of court payment to settle a tax case did nothing to help the
shares which fell 21 to 1158p.
Troubled discount house, Union Discount, lost 10 to 143p on nervousness
about interest rate trends.
Vodafone fell 7 to 371p on selling ahead of the company's annual results on
Tuesday. There was talk that James Capel had gone increasingly bearish but
the agency broker said it had not changed its long-held recommendation to
switch out of Vodafone and into Cable and Wireless (off 2 at 553p).
The threat of an anti-smoking verdict by the US Supreme Court continued to
weigh on tobacco shares. BAT Industries slid 14 to 781p and Rothmans 'B'
were 17 down at 1063p. Regional brewer Devenish gained 7 to 285p on
speculation about a possible bid. Boddington, believed by some to be about
to make another offer for Devenish, after failing to gain control of the
company a year ago, was unchanged at 185p.
Two large food manufacturers announce results next week, but showed rather
different performances yesterday, with Unigate, reporting Tuesday rising 6
to 347p and Northern Foods, with figures due Wednesday, falling 11 to 604p.
Unigate is expected to announce profits of Pounds 85m to Pounds 91m, against
Pounds 75.5m, while analysts are looking for Northern Foods to produce
Pounds 123m to Pounds 126m compared with Pounds 105.4m.
Price discounting hit the holding companies of the large DIY chains. Boots,
part owner of Do It All, slipped 8 to 459p., The 'A' shares of its partner
in the DIY venture, WH Smith, lost 10 to 450p. Kingfisher, B&amp;Q's parent,
also fell 10 to 525p.
A nervous week for property group MEPC, with its long term debt downgraded
by Moody's and rumours about the possible loss of the company's Footsie
status, saw the shares lose another 4 to 311p.
Blue Circle, declined 8 to 239p after Thursday's announcement of a Pounds
241.6m rights issue. Other building materials suppliers also weakened, with
RMC sliding 16 to 579p and Tarmac losing 5 to 124p.
In transports, P&amp;O gave up 11 to 491p after Kleinwort Benson turned negative
on the stock. BAA hardened 6 to 665p ahead of Monday's results.
Among engineering stocks, Vickers jumped 7 to 170p after two sizeable buying
orders that followed a lunch at BZW with investors on Thursday.
Glynwed International fell 9 to 255p after its broker reduced its current
year profits estimate by Pounds 5m to Pounds 45m.

FT  06 JUN 92 / International Company News: Chemical Bank lifts prime rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHEMICAL Bank yesterday increased its prime lending rate from 6.25 per cent
to 6.5 per cent to bring it into line with other US banks.
Two months ago, in anticipation of a cut by the Federal Reserve, Chemical
cut its own prime rate to 6.25 per cent.
The hoped-for cut by the Fed, however, never materialised, and Chemical's
lower prime rate failed to attract any additional customer loan business. A
spokesman said yesterday: 'We don't see any further easing (of monetary
policy) in the short term, so we are going back in line with the market.'

at Kimbalda
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian resources group, yesterday
said a proposed ADollars 105m (USDollars 80.1m) expansion at its Kambalda
nickel operations would be postponed, in spite of legislation relaxing
restrictions on working hours.
The project has been abandoned or postponed several times over the last year
as WMC pursued talks with the miners' union for a switch from five-day to
seven-day continuous mining.
The group reached agreement with the union last month after a series of
strikes and other disruptions to production. But the agreement was
conditional on the passage of amendments to mining legislation through the
Western Australian state parliament.
The amendments were approved on Thursday, but only after the government had
added a further clause giving the state's mining minister the right to
change permissible hours at his discretion.
Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC managing director, said the additional amendment was
'anything but acceptable'.
The project is part of an ADollars 400m programme to boost group nickel
output from 53,000 to 65,000 tonnes a year.

FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Purves plays a cool hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR William Purves, chairman of Hongkong and Shanghai Bank, was lunching on
the 11th floor of the bank's Bishopsgate offices when he was told Lloyds was
pulling out of the battle for Midland.
According to one of the guests, Mr Purves scarcely flinched. 'He remained
poker-faced. There was not even a smile. All he said was: 'We can't afford
to relax yet.''
By yesterday afternoon, as he dashed for the evening flight back to Hong
Kong, Mr Purves' normally steely exterior started showing the first traces
of good humour. He even joked about missing the aeroplane. But caution, and
determination not to be seen to be gloating, masked any celebration.
'We haven't won yet. But I'm glad Lloyds has gone away. I'm also glad the
smokescreen has cleared. (Lloyds) has been a diversion and getting the
institutional shareholders to concentrate on our offer was a little
difficult,' he said.
Mr Purves said his bank had no strategy to see off Lloyds. 'I think they
began to see the boulder was too heavy,' he said. 'They've been thwarted at
every turn by people like the Monopolies and Mergers Commission. They lost
the beauty parade. I think they began to realise they were not going to
succeed.'
Back in Hong Kong, where Mr Purves' standing as chairman of the colony's
most important financial institution, as well as chief of the Jockey Club,
allows him to waltz through three or four drinks parties a night, more like
a member of the glitterati than a banker, he will prepare for the next
hurdle.
On Tuesday his bank holds an extraordinary general meeting to approve the
Midland bid, and the second offer document is due to be released on the same
day. 'We've still quite a lot of work to do, but I'm confident,' he said.
He was guarded about Hongkong Bank's longer-term plans for Midland, and
would only comment: 'There must be some rationalisations and some
streamlining. But it's still a bit early to say.'

FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Customers will find out if they were right
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE THE takeover battle raged, there was little doubt that Hongkong and
Shanghai Bank was the choice of Midland's staff and customers.
Small businessmen and tenant farmers were among Midland customer groups that
stood up to be counted against the Lloyds bid. Now that it looks probable
that Hongkong will take over Midland, what changes lie ahead for the
customers?
Outwardly, many things will doubtless continue much as they always have done
at Midland's 1,800 branches. Marine Midland, Hongkong Bank's US subsidiary,
retains most of its traditional upstate East Coast American character more
than a decade after it was taken over.
But Midland will now become part of a global group whose twin specialities
are retail banking and small businesses with commercial instincts developed
in the dynamic markets of south-east Asia. That, combined with the stronger
capitalisation of the group, should mean a wider range of services with a
greater emphasis on efficiency.
The good news for Midland customers is likely to be superior banking
technology, operated at less cost and tailor-made for customer needs.
Hongkong Bank has developed one of the most advanced banking computer
services in the world, carrying out most of its own software design work
internally.
Even before Lloyds had withdrawn from the fray, Hongkong Bank had announced
plans to unify and standardise Midland's computer systems and link them into
its global network by 1996, through HBS, a new centralised computer system
being built at a cost of USDollars 105m (Pounds 58m).
Hongkong's products have been built to service small businesses and
companies scattered across many countries. The undisputed star among these
services is Hexagon, a computerised office and home banking system. Last
month Hexagon was linked to Midland's computer network. It has not yet been
offered to customers, but Banktrack and Cashtrack, two of its component
services, are soon to be available.
Hongkong expects to make sharp reductions in the cost and the number of
employees needed at Midland's computer operations. It employs only 580
computer staff, compared with Midland's 1,280.
The defeat of the Lloyds bid means that small businesses will not get the
goodies Lloyds promised them if the offer succeeded.
Yesterday Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds chairman, made clear that although the
bank will do what it can for its customers, without the economies of scale
that would have come from a merger with Midland, the scope to introduce such
improvements has become much more limited.

FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lloyds retreat ends Bank's embarrassment -
Leigh-Pemberton left as uncomfortable spectator / Institutions' hopes are
dashed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE PERSON would have been very relieved yesterday to learn that the
struggle between Lloyds and Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation for
control of Midland Bank had ended, with Lloyds' decision to bow out of the
fray.
That person is Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the Governor of the Bank of
England, who has been a most uncomfortable spectator of the first hostile
attempt by one UK clearing bank to acquire another UK clearing bank.
Sir Jeremy Morse, chairman of Lloyds, said yesterday that the Bank had been
scrupulously neutral during the bidding contest.
Such neutrality was more a question of necessity for the Bank than of
choice. Under the terms of the 1987 Banking Act, the Bank can interfere in a
bank's affairs only if it perceives a threat to depo-sitors.
If the Bank's powers had not become more limited since the passing of the
Banking Act, it would almost certainly have tried to deter Lloyds from
responding to Hongkong's initial bid.
The Bank felt Midland might have been damaged by the uncertainty over its
future ownership.
In particular, it feared that the morale of Midland's staff was likely to be
undermined and that senior executives would quit the bank for fear that
under Lloyds' ownership they would have had poor job prospects.
But there was one incident in particular that unsettled the Bank during the
contest. That was the publication in newspapers of extracts from an early
draft of Lloyds' submission to the Office of Fair Trading on why the
competition authorities should permit Lloyds to buy Midland. Part of Lloyds'
argument in the submission was that Midland's depositors might be at risk
under the ownership of Hongkong Bank, because of the alleged threat that the
stability of Hongkong Bank would be undermined by China's taking control of
Hong Kong after 1997.
In effect, Lloyds was undercutting the authority of the Bank by asking the
OFT to take a view on an issue concerning the protection of depositors or a
'prudential' issue. Such prudential questions are normally settled by the
Bank independently of other arms of government.
The Bank's concern was not so great that Lloyds was asking the OFT to take a
view on the prudential question. Its concern was that Lloyds should be seen
to be doing so.
Lloyds denied that the leak of the report was deliberate. The Bank was not
only unhappy about the contest for control of Midland, but also bemused
about Lloyds' motives. It has been convinced that Lloyds did not stand any
chance of having its proposed bid cleared by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Lloyds' views that there are probably too many bank branches in the UK - and
that a takeover by Lloyds of Midland would have allowed an orderly programme
of branch closures - attracted some sympathy in the Bank.
The Bank was convinced, though, that Lloyds would have found it impossible
to convince the MMC that such a takeover would not have posed a severe
threat to competition in some banking products and some regions.
The Bank has been acutely aware that banks are a favourite whipping boy of
politicians. It could not conceive therefore that a perceived reduction in
banking competition, particularly in the politically sensitive business of
providing loans to small businesses, would have been sanctioned by the MMC
and subsequently by the government.
There is one other illustration of the Bank's inability to control the
course of events in the battle for control of Midland. Mr Leigh-Pemberton
has been deeply involved in ensuring that Midland did not run into severe
difficulties since late 1990, after the collapse of an initial plan for a
merger between Midland and Hongkong Bank.
At the same time, Midland's profits were collapsing and it was about to
become the first UK clearing bank to cut its dividend since the 1930s.
So, to bolster confidence in the bank, Mr Leigh-Pemberton asked Mr Brian
Pearse to move from Barclays, where he was finance director, to become chief
executive of Midland.
Mr Pearse agreed on the condition that he would not merely be a caretaker at
Midland until it was bought by another bank.
He wanted a commitment from Mr Leigh-Pemberton that he would do what he
could to keep Midland independent for at least two years.
Mr Pearse felt he received such a commitment. But in late November, only
seven months after he took up the new post, Sir Jeremy Morse contacted his
opposite number at Midland, Sir Peter Walters, and suggested they meet in
secret to discuss a merger.
Midland felt obliged to talk to Lloyds, in deference to the interests of its
shareholders. In the event, Lloyds' interest persuaded Hongkong to renew its
plans to buy Midland. There followed a period of secret negotiations between
Midland and the rival suitors. On March 13, Midland's board backed the
approach from Hongkong Bank because it was convinced that a bid from Lloyds
would be blocked by the competition authorities.
Lloyds would not be deterred. Six weeks later, it announced publicly that it
wanted to buy Midland.
For all Sir Jeremy's protestations that this was not a hostile takeover
attempt, Midland has clearly seen it as such. Sir Jeremy admits that in the
final analysis Midland must be the arbiter of the friendliness of his
intentions.
There is also no doubt that the Bank, too, regarded Lloyds' actions as
hostile to Midland, but it was powerless to intervene. In the great banking
drama that was unfolding, it had become more a spectator than a protagonist.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE DECISION by Lloyds Bank to pull out of the bidding for its smaller
rival, Midland, was greeted with regret by investors. Many had not only
hoped for a more generous offer but had been hesitant at the thought of
holding a large stake in Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
'What a pity,' sighed one of Midland's main institutional shareholders, who
had championed Lloyds' bid.
Lloyds' success in paring its costs and focusing its business has won
admiration from its institutional shareholders. They had hoped it would turn
those skills on Midland. They were also uncertain about the merits of HSBC's
global operations and feared that its profitable Hong Kong activities would
cease after 1997.
The unease about holding HSBC shares is not significant enough, however, to
deter shareholders from taking advantage of the offer now that cash has been
added to the pot.
Investors also said that regardless of any concerns they might have about
HSBC's businesses, the new bank would be one of Britain's largest companies
and its shares would rank near the top of the key stock indices. Thus the
shares will have value because passive fund managers will have to own them
and active fund managers seeking to keep pace with the indices will have to
buy them.
Shareholders noted, however, that those institutions which had sold HSBC
shares short in the hope of covering the position with new shares are likely
to be disappointed. The current shares, which have a nominal value of
HKDollars 10 (70p) will be replaced by new ones with a face value of 75p.

<TEXT>
HONGKONG and Shanghai Bank took another step in its long journey home
yesterday when Lloyds capitulated and left the way free for Hongkong to
acquire Midland Bank.
It is a journey the bank has wanted to make for the best part of a decade
and it must be of some satisfaction to Mr William Purves, the bank's
chairman and the man who conceived the Midland deal, that he was in London
on the day Lloyds' board took its decision.
Hongkong Bank has played a dominate role in the colony since its founding in
1864. But, with China set to resume sovereignty of Hong Kong in 1997, it is
a role with a definite terminus.
Along with the old British that controlled the colony's trade and the Royal
Hong Kong Jockey Club, which still today strikes the beat to which polite
society marches, the bank is a quintessentially British institution in a
place that is daily coming under the influence of China.
That was seen most graphically last week when a group of mainland Chinese
local governments stumped up the lion's share of HKDollars 3.8bn (Pounds
270m) to buy an office block on the colony's central business district. It
is also seen in the mainland's ownership of significant stakes in Swire's
Cathay Pacific and Cable and Wireless's Hongkong Telecommunications.
The bank's acquisition of Midland is, therefore, more than just a
'strategic' move to give it global reach and a role to play in facilitating
trade in Europe's single market. Important as that is, its acquisition of
Midland is about corporate and cultural survival in a world made uncertain
by China's resumption of sovereignty of Hong Kong.
Swire and Cable and Wireless have made their peace with the colony's future
owners by selling substantial stakes of their key businesses to mainland
interests. Hongkong Bank has sought protection through moving offshore, and
in doing so has displayed more finesse than Jardine Matheson, the trading
house that rocked the colony in the early 1980s with its sudden announcement
that it would move its domicile to Bermuda.
The proposed structure for the new banking institution to be created out of
the takeover makes that plain. The head office will be in London, together
with the top executives. Hong Kong will be a subsidiary - the most
profitable to be sure - of the enlarged London-based group.
The bank realises the need for that and so does the colonial government, if
for different reasons. The Hongkong Bank has had its wings clipped since
Britain signed the 1984 Joint Declaration.
The informal, club-like, manner in which the colonial government managed
Hong Kong's financial affairs - often using the bank as its public agent in
times of crisis - has given way to a more transparent and formal set of
arrangements. That is seen in the nascent development of a monetary
authority that has taken over many of the central banking responsibilities
once seen as the bank's birthright, such as the setting of interest rates.
Its former position in the colony was not an arrangement China could really
tolerate inheriting. Hongkong Bank understood that.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Leading Article: EC suffers a Viking attack
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE ninth and 10th centuries, Vikings used from time to time to fall upon
the undefended coastlines of western Europe. Jacques Delors, Francois
Mitterrand, Helmut Kohl and John Major, not to mention the other headmen of
the European Community, now experience the shock and dismay of these earlier
Europeans. Like them, they are anxiously wondering whether they will be
allowed to rebuild their city in peace. Can Brussels be restored to its
former glories, let alone fulfil the dreams held for its future?
Not only the chieftains are in distress. Ordinary inhabitants are concerned
about the prospects for their bonds and their gilts, their sterling and
their pesetas. Not so long ago, after all, they may have believed that these
would be included with bunds and the D-Mark in the great palace of economic
and monetary union. Is that hope overturned?
Not necessarily. In the first place, the Maastricht plan for reconstructing
the European Community is not yet destroyed. The rest of the European
Community seems likely to ratify the Treaty in the course of this year. At
that stage, it might be possible to cajole Denmark either into economic and
monetary union or, if not, out of the EC altogether. Either way, the 11
could continue to live in the city that Jacques built.
Moreover, the palace of Emu had, in any case, not gone much further than the
foundations. It was already unclear whether it would be finished by 1997,
1999 or even at all. It was equally unclear who would be allowed to live in
it.
The questions now are, first, whether the palace is much less likely to be
completed than previously thought; and second, whether the present temporary
ERM accommodation might prove an adequate substitute.
Uncertain future
Even before the Viking raid, the uncertainties about the future had been
clearly shown in the market. Long-term interest differentials vis-a-vis
German bunds were larger than inflation differentials in the cases of
France, Italy, the UK and Spain, the four most important potential entrants
into Emu. This would suggest that, far from the markets being confident that
Emu would be built, they were even less confident than the continuation of
current inflation performance would imply.
Spanish long-term interest rates, for example, were some 3 1/2 percentage
points above the German in early 1992, even though consumer price inflation
was only about 2 percentage points higher. Startlingly, Italian long
interest rates were about 4 3/4 percentage points higher than the German
even though inflation was only 1 1/4 percentage points higher.
The bond markets were, therefore, already indicating substantial doubt about
the long-term chances of exchange rate stability. A 4 3/4 percentage point
interest differential would, for example, offset a devaluation of almost 40
per cent within a decade. Of these countries, only France had interest rates
compatible with the expectation of exchange rate stability, although the UK
had been getting close to that point.
How much more uncertain can something already so uncertain become? Remember
that in the cases of Italy and Spain the widening in differentials predated
agreement of the Maastricht Treaty. Those increased doubts reflected
awareness that there would not only be tough convergence criteria, but that
the date for Emu might be as late as 1999 or, judged by the sudden onset of
bitter internal German controversy over the fate of the D-Mark, later still.
Markets shaken
Inevitably, the result of the Danish referendum has shaken the markets
further. The yield on Danish bonds rose by some 25 basis points between
Tuesday and Friday. Those on Spanish bonds rose by almost 40 basis points,
while those on Italian bonds rose by some 35 points. But other yields were
somewhat less affected. British and French bond rates rose by less than 20
basis points, while Dutch and German bond rates were unaltered.
The question is whether this represents a once and for all shift or the
beginning of serious instability. There are good reasons for not panicking.
Exchange rate stability within the ERM, which has experienced no general
re-alignment since the beginning of 1987, reflects at least as much an
economic as a political commitment. Governments had become convinced that
inflation was a hindrance not a help.
Where governments can make that economic commitment credible and are also
not replaced as a result of the rigours thus imposed, the ERM can yet prove
a substitute for an always uncertain Emu. This has a good chance of being
true of the UK. Given Mr Pierre Beregovoy's popularity, the same should be
true of France. Felipe Gonzalez also seems to have a chance of establishing
his government's convergence policy before elections due in Spain next year.
Only in Italy, of the major countries, would the failure of Maastricht make
convergence hugely less likely than now.
The Danes have inflicted a noteworthy shock. But the city can be rebuilt
and, even if not, it might not mean the end of economic stability in Europe.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Man in the News: Hired gun of haute couture - Karl Lagerfeld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Karl Lagerfeld is one of the world's most famous fashion designers. He is
also a very astute businessman. It was, after all, his accountant who told
American Vogue that he had been blessed with 'un chromosome de plus'.
This week Mr Lagerfeld - and his admiring accountant - discovered how much
that extra chromosome was worth. Dunhill, the UK luxury goods group, paid up
to Pounds 16m to buy Karl Lagerfeld, the fashion business that bears his
name, in the middle of one of the worst recessions that the luxury goods
industry has known.
Mr Lagerfeld himself will not receive a penny. Dunhill has bought the
Lagerfeld business from Revillon, the private French company that owned it.
'Kaiser Karl', as the fashion press calls him because of his imperious air,
is one of the new breed of freelance fashion designers who do not invest in
their labels but are paid a fee to design for them. He has said that he
'hates empires' and that he does not want 'the responsibility' of being an
employer.
This arrangement will continue under Dunhill, which has also signed Mr
Lagerfeld - for another undisclosed fee - to return to his old role as chief
designer of Chloe, another Paris fashion house in the Dunhill stable.
Dunhill has done the deal at a difficult time. The whole luxury goods
industry has suffered in the recession, but fashion has been one of the most
vulnerable sectors. The Karl Lagerfeld shops in London (which were not owned
by Revillon) went into receivership earlier this year.
Lord Douro, chairman of Dunhill, purports to be unperturbed. Dunhill, he
says, needed 'a designer of Lagerfeld's stature' to relaunch Chloe and it
also wanted to acquire another Paris fashion house.
Nor was Lord Douro deterred by the fact that the workaholic Mr Lagerfeld,
53, also works as a free lance designer for a number of other fashion
houses, including Fendi of Italy, Steilman of Germany and Chanel in Paris.
'He told me that there was still a side of his creative personality which
was unfulfilled,' he said.
Indeed it was the spectre of Chanel's success - and Mr Lagerfeld's role in
its revival - that persuaded Dunhill to expand its fashion interests at a
time when the market was so depressed.
Mr Lagerfeld has helped to turn Chanel into one of the world's most
lucrative luxury goods groups. He was poached from Chloe in 1983 by Mr Alain
Wertheimer, who had taken over Chanel - by dint of firing his own father -
nine years before. When Mr Wertheimer arrived, Chanel was a floundering
fashion house living off the memories of its founder, Coco Chanel, and her
sartorial triumphs in the 1920s, and was selling its perfumes in downmarket
retail outlets.
Memories were not enough. Mr Wertheimer realised he had to bring back the
glamour of Coco's heyday. He pulled the perfumes out of their downmarket
outlets and looked for a designer who could restore the house to its former
glory. Finally he chose Karl Lagerfeld.
Usually when designers join an established fashion house they stamp their
own style on it. Mr Lagerfeld's approach was different. He chose to
appropriate the classic elements of 1920s Chanel - chunky tweed suits,
quilted bags with chains - and to reinterpret them for the 1980s.
What he did was to apply the post-modernist principle of mixing historical
motifs with contemporary forms, then popular in art and architecture, to
fashion. He also created very sellable clothes. The Chanel suit became the
status symbol for successful women - and wives of successful men - in the
1980s. They loved the short skirts, which showed off their aerobics-toned
legs. They adored the big buttons, with their distinctive double C insignia,
that told their friends where they had bought the suit and how much they had
paid (at least Pounds 1,250).
Chanel now sells biker boots for Pounds 700 and costume ear-rings for Pounds
500. Its flagship store on the Rue Cambon in Paris is so packed with
Japanese tourists clamouring to buy its quilted leather bags that it has
'rationed' them to no more than three bags per person.
Nobody knows exactly how much money Chanel makes. As a private company it
can, and does, refuse to disclose financial details. The best estimate is
that it has annual sales of Pounds 500m and profit margins of at least 20
per cent. Mr Lagerfeld is said to be paid a fee of Dollars 1m for each of
the four Chanel collections he designs every year.
One of the ironies of the fashion industry is that most of this money comes
not from clothes, but from accessories - scents, shoes, bags and biker
boots. Four out of five purchases at Rue Cambon are accessories. Mr
Wertheimer's masterstroke was to use the allure of the fashion collections
to sell them.
No designer is better at creating that allure than Mr Lagerfeld. He plays
the publicity game to perfection. The glossy magazines are filled with
(generally flattering) features of 'Kaiser Karl', the 18th-century buff with
his signature pony-tail, his passion for Louis XV furniture, his penchant
for hand-written notes and his horror of telephones.
Even his tantrums are faithfully reported. There are the super-models he
hires and fires. The muses whom he adores and then abandons. There is the
sad story of Ms Kitty D'Alessio who, as head of Chanel in the US, introduced
him to Mr Wertheimer only to be ousted by her former protege.
This is the reputation that Dunhill is buying, by acquiring the Lagerfeld
label and bringing the Kaiser back to Chloe.
It hopes to replicate the elan, but it is not going to be easy. Karl
Lagerfeld left Chloe to take his starring role in Chanel's success story in
1983 when the economic environment was overwhelmingly positive. He is
returning to Chloe in a much more competitive climate, when the luxury goods
industry is struggling. Extra chromosome or not, even the appeal of the
Lagerfeld name was not enough to save its London shops from the receivers.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Damage control in the housing market: The limited scope for
revival in the fortunes of the property sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDEr
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS WEEK'S meeting between government ministers and building society
leaders was not a notably joyful affair. The good news, for want of a better
phrase, was about damage limitation.
Since the beginning of the year there has been a modest improvement in the
rate of repossessions - largely because of the payment of income support
direct to building societies, but also because the societies are keeping
more people in their homes through counselling and renegotiation of mortgage
terms.
Yet the housing market remains obdurately weak, even though mortgage
interest rates have fallen from 15.4 per cent in 1990 to less than 11 per
cent today. Although house prices look more affordable than for many years,
Halifax, the biggest society, has just reported a seasonally adjusted fall
in prices for the seventh successive month. The continuing rise in
unemployment is doing nothing to help.
A more technical explanation for the state of the market is the fact that
many people have mortgages larger than the value of their homes, leaving
them, in the jargon, with negative equity.
This week's UBS Phillips &amp; Drew estimate of 2m home owners with negative
equity is regarded by some building society chiefs as too high. Yet there is
no doubt that the inability of this group to move up the housing ladder
without incurring losses acts as a brake on the market.
An additional handicap for the market is that many second-mortgage lenders
who have seen most of the security for their loans wiped out are waiting for
an upturn before foreclosing on troubled borrowers. That might take some
bounce out of a price recovery.
All that helps to explain the weakness of the wider economy, since so much
consumer spending is related to house purchase. And after the first
significant fall in nominal house prices since 1945, there is a wider
question to be asked about values.
The recent spectacular price booms - two in the 1970s and one in the late
1980s - were a by-product of inflation. With house prices rising faster than
interest rates and mortgage debt eroding in real terms, homeowners made
profits out of borrowing. Even when prices stopped rising, borrowers were
cushioned because real interest rates were negative at the crucial moment.
Today everything is different, because the government has embarked on
severely disinflationary policies, reinforced by the European Exchange Rate
Mechanism.
Inflation is much lower than in the mid 1970s or the early 1980s, while
interest rates are positive in real terms. Hence the huge fall in nominal
house prices in the south of the country, where the boom was most out of
hand.
The government's difficulty is that in spite of such high real rates of
interest, earnings growth in the economy is still well above the ERM
average.
The rate of interest that the Treasury regards as appropriate to deal with
inflationary pressure in the labour market is thoroughly deflationary for
the housing market. And if earnings are going to have to rise much more
slowly, house prices, which tend to increase in the long run with average
earnings, will rise more slowly.
Nearly a third of householders under the age of 25 are owner-occupiers,
because people fear being left off the housing ladder and want to make an
effortless profit. But if potential homeowners conclude that another house
price spiral is unlikely, the investment element of the demand for houses
may disappear.
Other factors pushing in the same direction are the erosion of mortgage
interest relief in real terms and a more cautious approach by lenders.
That caution may soon be reinforced as insurance companies review
loss-making mortwith lenders. In the past, insurers have covered building
societies on an absurdly imprudent basis. Although they were at risk on the
first 20 to 30 per cent of the loss on the value of a home, they did not
assess the value or the borrower's creditworthiness for themselves.
Such practices are unlikely to be repeated, since the resulting losses to
the insurers will, on some estimates, be as high as Pounds 3bn in 1991, 1992
and 1993. That means it will be harder to borrow 95 or 100 per cent of the
value of an asset with a price that can go down as well as up.
Unless the government abandons its disinflationary policies - which looks
unlikely - housing seems likely to underperform other types of investment
over the present decade.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Thatcher generation dominates honours
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Margaret Thatcher's generation dominates today's dissolution honours
list as it dominated the political landscape in the 1980s.
Those who contributed both to her political survival (such as Mr Cecil
Parkinson and Mr Norman Tebbit) and to her downfall (such as Sir Geoffrey
Howe and Mr Nigel Lawson) are among the 21 new life peers. Sir Ian Gilmour
and Mr Peter Walker, longstanding members of the 'wet' wing of the Tory
party, are also honoured.
With many of the new peers expected to have taken their seats before the
summer recess, the House of Lords is set to become the scene for as vigorous
a debate on the future of the European Community as the Commons has been.
Mr Denis Healey, a former chancellor and often regarded as the best leader
Labour never had, leads the six Labour nominees, who also include Mr Merlyn
Rees, a former home secretary, and Mr Jack Ashley, a former health secretary
and a staunch campaigner on behalf of the disabled.
The notable absentee from Labour's list is Mr Michael Foot, the former
cabinet minister and leader of the party, who stood down as an MP at the
election.
Although Downing Street refuses to comment on such matters, Mr Foot is
assumed to have refused a life peerage, rather than not to have been offered
one.
Mr Geraint Howells, the former MP for Ceredigion and Pembroke North, is the
Liberal Democrat life peer.
There had been speculation that in spite of her expressed view against it,
Mrs Thatcher might be offered a hereditary peerage, as Mr Harold Macmillan
was. She herself brought hereditary peerages back into practice, offering
them to a former Speaker, Mr George Thomas (now Viscount Tonypandy) and to
Mr William (now Viscount) Whitelaw, formerly a deputy prime minister.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is said not to have any objection to
hereditary peerages. Mr Bernard Weatherill, the former Speaker, might have
been offered such a peerage if Mrs Thatcher had received one. Instead he
gains a life peerage and,although a Tory, is likely to follow his
predecessor and sit on the cross-benches as an independent.
The dissolution honours list can often seem almost a matter of form, but
that was not the case for Dr David Owen, the former leader of the former
Social Democratic party, for whom - lacking a party to put forward his name
 -a peerage was not inevitable. He will sit on the cross-benches as an
independent social democrat.
An unexpected baron is Dr Dafydd Elis Thomas, former MP for Meirionnedd Nant
Conwy, who will become the first Plaid Cymru life peer. When he announced
his decision to stand down at the election, he told S4C, the Welsh-language
television channel, that he had become disillusioned with the House of
Commons as 'an ineffectual body tied to outdated traditions and almost
beyond reform'.
Also notable is the inclusion of Mr Harry Ewing, the former Labour MP for
Falkirk East, who entered the Commons in 1971. Mr Ewing was a junior
Scottish Office minister from 1974 to 1979, but may have received his
peerage as much for seniority within the Scottish party as for having held
office. He was among the MPs who last year backed a bill to abolish
political honours.
There are two new privy counsellors: Mr Francis Maude, whose election defeat
in Warwickshire North prevented his probable appointment to the cabinet; and
Mr Robert Boscawen, who retired as MP for Somerton and Frome.
Mr Harold Walker, who stood down as chairman of ways and means and first
deputy Speaker at the beginning of the new parliament, is the only Labour MP
to receive a knighthood - an honour he shares with three defeated Tories,
including Mr David Trippier, a former minister, and Mr Anthony
Beaumont-Dark, a widely quoted backbencher.
In his pursuit of a 'classless society', Mr Major has made clear his desire
to reform the honours system, and today's list is expected to be almost the
last under the old rules.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Lloyd's claims successes in US legal battles
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYD'S of London claimed successes yesterday in a complicated series of
legal battles with dissident US Names - the individuals whose assets provide
the insurance market's capital.
Yet its moves to increase its central fund, which pays claims when Names are
unable to meet their obligations, looks likely to be challenged by rebel
Names in the UK.
In the biggest US case, in which 91 Names are suing Lloyd's for breach of US
securities laws, Judge Maurice Lasker ruled earlier this week that the
plaintiffs must respond to a number of motions to dismiss the case, and
denied the Names permission to plead their complaints again.
Lawyers for Lloyd's say that means the court will now consider the issue of
jurisdiction in the case. Lloyd's, which says disputes between Names and
their agents should be heard in UK rather than US courts, has already scored
some victories in litigation with overseas Names on this issue.
On May 29 a US district court in Chicago dismissed a suit brought by Mr
Kenneth Bonny, Ms Francesca Bonny and one other US Name to prevent Lloyd's
from drawing down letters of credit in order to meet insurance claims.
Meanwhile, a number of Names intend to campaign to force Lloyd's to hold an
extraordinary general meeting of all Names. They are angry at a new
compulsory levy to be charged to all Names, needed to fund a Pounds 500m
increase in the central fund.
According to Mr Richard Astor, who is advising the group, the levy is 'a
sneaky attempt to bypass democratic controls at Lloyd's'.
In a separate development, the Society of Names, an organisation of Names
facing losses, has protested that the Lloyd's magazine, Lloyd's Log, is
refusing to carry a service reporting which syndicates are dominated by
working Names, who have jobs in the market.

FEARS THAT the privatisation of British Rail might lead to service cuts were

The service was one of 15 listed as vulnerable in a BR memorandum leaked to

service to be cut is the daily InterCity train from Cleethorpes, Grimsby,
Lincoln and Newark to London.
BR said the decision had been taken for commercial reasons.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TGWU general union, Britain's biggest union and largest affiliate to the
Labour party, yesterday signalled its intention to block any radical reform
of the link between the unions and the party.
Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said his union would draft a motion
for the Labour conference that would reject most of the reforms being
canvassed, including the idea of giving party membership to union members
paying the political levy.
He suggested, however, that his union executive believed there could be
radical reform of the Trades Union Congress. Mr Morris said the TUC should
stop 'reinventing the wheel' by performing functions individual unions could
do for themselves, and should abandon the fiction of influencing the
government with its alternative economic analyses.
Mr Morris refused to say that Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, was
the right man for the job. 'We work with the leader we have,' he said.
The TGWU statement is the latest sign of opposition to the radical shake-up
of union-Labour links that was envisaged after the general election.
All three candidates for the Labour deputy leadership now stress the
importance of retaining the link. The Nupe public-service union warned last
week that unions would not fund Labour if they had no direct influence in
the party.
Several unions, including the TGWU and the GMB general union, oppose the
Labour national executive committee's proposal to exclude unions from
selection and reselection of party candidates.
Mr Morris also countered charges that the TGWU's backing for Mr John Smith
and Mrs Margaret Beckett as leader and deputy leader was not justified given
the number of members consulted.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Hoteliers face lengthy wait for recovery: Little room for
optimism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE and CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WILL take Britain's hoteliers at least another 18 months to climb out of
last year's business trough.
Mid-way through 1992, it is clear that recovery by the year end is unlikely
to restore the industry to the profit levels of 1990. A survey by Expotel
Hotel Reservations this week showed that tariff prices of hotel rooms in
Britain in the year to April fell for the first time for 10 years, with
average room rates 1 per cent lower.
Industry analysts suggest that grossly understates the combined effects on
hotel prices last year of the loss of trade due to the Gulf War, UK
recession and the sterling-dollar exchange rate.
Business travel fell by nearly 11 per cent under the impact of company
cost-cutting. Overseas business demand never recovered from the Gulf War and
was 10.6 per cent lower. Bookings by holidaymakers from abroad were 20 per
cent down as the number of North American visitors during the summer fell by
45 per cent.
The bigger hotel chains recouped some of the losses by developing
short-break leisure packages. The domestic leisure sector grew from less
than 10 per cent to 14 per cent of the total hotel market during the year,
but smaller chains and independent hotels lost market share.
In total, demand for hotel rooms fell by 8.8 per cent - a loss of 2.45m room
nights.
Mr Paul Slattery, of Kleinwort Benson, the merchant bank and securities
group, estimates that average achieved room rates fell by about 25 per cent.
He said that in London, which bore the brunt of the downturn, 'discounts of
50 per cent from the published room rates were not uncommon and in an
attempt to win contract business, such as aircrews, some chains discounted
even further'.
Some hotels held room prices but provided additional services and facilities
free.
Mr Bruce Jones, analyst at Smith New Court, said: 'One of the most notable
developments of the year was that people got into the habit of asking for
discounts.'
Hoteliers are reluctant to admit that room rates will remain under pressure.
'Bargains? I can't see it,' said Mr Norbert Petersen, senior operations
director for Mount Charlotte, which has 105 hotels, with 14,180 bedrooms,
throughout Britain. 'It's always horses for courses. We all have increased
costs - and shareholders.'
Mr Peter Cashman, group general manager of Friendly Hotels, with 21
three-star hotels from Perth to Eastbourne, said his business had held up
because its prices were already very competitive. Like some other chains,
Friendly Hotels had not increased its prices in the last year. It had,
however, stepped up promotion and sales activity.
Mr Martin Marcus, deputy chairman of Queens Moat Houses, with 103 British
hotels, admitted that Gatwick had been a black spot and described the
Expotel report's claim that Gatwick three-star hotel prices had dropped by
15.31 per cent as conservative.
Overall, he said, there was now some optimism. 'I feel it, but I haven't yet
seen the figures to show it.'
Nevertheless, Kleinwort Benson's estimates suggest that average achieved
room rates this year will grow by less than 4 per cent and that it will be
the mid 1990s before they again reach 1990 levels.
Competition will remain fierce. The leisure market has been flat and
business demand for rooms is expected to grow by only 3 per cent this year.
Hotels in London and other big cities that suffered more than those in
Scotland and the English provinces may now fare better. The bigger chains
are expected to squeeze more business out of the smaller operators; and the
attrition of the downmarket, underfunded end of the industry will continue.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Canary Wharf sale is prepared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NO MORE than 'half a dozen serious players worldwide' would be interested in
rescuing Canary Wharf, according to the administrators of the Pounds 1.5bn
project in the London Docklands.
The administrators are putting together information needed by potential
purchasers about leases, construction contracts, the project's financial
structure and the costs of the promised contribution to the Jubilee Line
extension.
They were non-committal about the prospects of finding investors for the
project, which may face liquidation unless new funds are provided to pay
creditors and complete vital construction work.
'It is too early to say it will definitely go into liquidation,' said Mr
Nigel Hamilton, one of three administrators from Ernst &amp; Young, the
accountancy firm appointed nine days ago. The decision to seek protection
against the project's creditors followed similar action in Canada by Olympia
&amp; York, its parent company.
The administrators declined to discuss the nature, price or timing of
potential deals. Mr Hamilton said: 'It would be invidious to put a timescale
on negotiations.'
Unsecured creditors, including building contractors, are owed Pounds 50m,
the administrators disclosed. They put the total cost of the project at
Pounds 1.5bn.
At a meeting with the administrators on Thursday night, Lord Wakeham, who is
co-ordinating the government's response to Canary Wharf's administration,
told the administrators to negotiate directly with individual departments
about potential lettings to civil servants.
Lord Wakeham also confirmed the government's position that Olympia &amp; York or
a purchaser of Canary Wharf should honour the agreement to contribute Pounds
400m to the extension of the Jubilee Line. Mr Stephen Adamson, one of the
administrators, said the meeting had been 'helpful'.
Mr Adamson said the importance of civil servants' to the project depended on
the amount and price of the space taken. 'It might be important; it might
not be,' he said.
In Canary Wharf's bank borrowings of just over Pounds 1.1bn, there are two
main facilities, a Pounds 570m loan from 11 international banks which is
secured on the project, and a Pounds 400m loan from four Canadian banks:
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal Bank of Canada, National Bank of
Canada and the Bank of Nova Scotia.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE CREATION of a list of certain art treasures that could not be exported
was rejected yesterday by Mr David Mellor, national heritage secretary,
Alison Smith writes.
The idea of the list, containing probably about 2,000 items, was proposed by
the committee that advises on the export of works of art.
Mr Mellor said listing 'would represent a diminution in the rights of owners
to dispose of their property as they saw fit' while banning the export of
outstanding heritage items 'would distort the market value, both for
outstanding items and others'.
He said he shared the view of almost all those who had commented that the
disadvantages of a list outweighed the benefits. He believed there were
other ways of protecting heritage, such as the acceptance of works of art in
lieu of tax.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Maxwell associate may hold key post
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL STONEY, a close associate of Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell, is
believed to have been appointed to the board of Sphere, the Californian
video games company which is still part of the Maxwell empire.
The late Robert Maxwell bought an 80 per cent stake in Sphere, which trades
as Spectrum Holobyte, in 1987. The company, which expects turnover of
Dollars 20m this year, is ultimately controlled through the Maxwell
Charitable Foundation in Liechtenstein.
Arthur Andersen, the administrators, started legal action in the US last
month seeking access to the Liechtenstein interests.
Two months ago lawyers for the foundation asked Mr Gilman Louie, Sphere's
founder, to appoint Mr Stoney to the board. Ms Christine Maxwell is a
director of the company and Mr Kevin Maxwell was a director until recently.
Because Mr Louie holds only about 11 per cent of the company he is outvoted.
He assumes the appointment of Mr Stoney has gone ahead.
Sphere's board has not met since 1989.
Mr Stoney is former deputy managing director of AGB International, the
former Maxwell market research company, and former deputy managing director
(finance) of Mirror Group Newspapers.
An office has been prepared for Mr Stoney in a London building rented by
Sphere Inc at 2 Wardrobe Place off Ludgate Hill.
With the Maxwell brothers, Mr Stoney refused to answer questions from a
House of Commons select committee on pensions this year.
Investigators fear that the Maxwell brothers intend trying to relaunch a
business career using Sphere at least in part as a vehicle.
Mr Louie is now exploring ways of trying to buy a majority stake in the
company with the help of venture capital funds. If that proves impossible,
the key people may simply quit, leaving a shell behind, and start a new
video games company.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Pressure put on ministers over London's hospitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE FUTURE of London's hospitals
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
one of the most sensitive post-election health issues to face the government
 -began exerting political strain on ministers yesterday.
Demands by Labour MPs for a ministerial statement on financial difficiulties
in London's health service were ignored in the Commons but are likely to be
renewed next week.
There is broad acceptance that central London is over-provided with hospital
beds, and a government inquiry under Sir Bernard Tomlinson is examining
health provision in the capital.
The four London health regions received relatively generous financial
settlements this year - Pounds 417m more than their precise entitlement - in
the hope of buying stability during the Tomlinson inquiry. Nevertheless,
some hospitals and health authorities face serious financial pressures.
Bloomsbury and Islington district health authority is seeking to contain a
projected Pounds 19m overspend and 200 jobs may be at risk. The Middlesex
and University College teaching hospitals may be affected, while the
Elizabeth Garrett Anderson women's hospital is threatened with closure.
The financial difficulties of central London teaching hospitals are
intensified by the new contract-based system of funding health care. Health
authorities in the home counties are treating more patients locally rather
than sending them to London hospitals, which are relatively expensive.
Sir Bernard is giving Mrs Virginia Bottomley, health secretary, regular
briefings but he is unlikely to report before the autumn. The health
department has denied reports that Mrs Bottomley had asked Sir Bernard to
report by August.
Later this month, the influential King's Fund health policy think tank will
publish the results of its own investigation into health provision in
London, and ministers intend to take that into account.
Mrs Bottomley said yesterday it would be 'for ministers to take the
difficult decisions'. They would be made in the best interests of the health
service and patients in London and the rest of the country.
The decisions are likely to prove extremely difficult. There is considerable
agreement in the NHS that London has excessive teaching hospital provision
and relatively poor local services in some parts of the city, but a decision
to close world-famous institutions would meet strong resistance.

FT  06 JUN 92 / A secret world keen to shake off a shady reputation: Robert
Maxwell's links with Liechtenstein have again cast a dubious limelight on
the tiny principality / A look at the pros and cons of the tax haven
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE of the frustrating things about Liechtenstein is finding it on a map.
The principality is so small that its outlines tend to get obscured among
the motorways, rivers and town names in the border region between Austria
and Switzerland.
Such geographical elusoriness adds to the slightly shady and mysterious
image that Liechtenstein has acquired as a result of scandals involving
individuals whose ill gotten gains it helps to conceal.
It is an image that the principality's leaders want to destroy. They see
their country as a harmless little enclave trying to make its way in a
difficult world, and they are dismayed that Robert Maxwell apparently abused
their laws and regulations as egregiously as he did those in Britain.
Liechtenstein is one of the handful of small countries that thrive by
helping rich individuals and companies to conceal their assets from tax
inspectors. They attract that clientele with a number of strategies. The
most important is very low tax rates. Foundations of the kind set up by Mr
Maxwell pay no income tax in Liechtenstein and face an annual levy on
capital or net worth of 0.1 per cent.
Such countries also eschew double-taxation agreements with other countries
and they permit locally established companies, trusts and foundations to
operate in great secrecy.
According to Mr Bryan Jeeves, a British trust adviser based in the
principality, the number of companies, trusts and foundations set up by and
for foreigners in Liechtenstein - often called letterbox companies  - now
numbers about 100,000.
The spread of companies is global, according to Mr Jeeves, and the taxes
paid, although low, accounted for about a fifth of the principality's direct
revenues of SFr361m in 1990.
When the taxes of the banks, legal practices and their employees are added,
the economic importance of this activity is clear. The substantial revenues
from it also mean that corporate and individual income tax rates can be
relatively low.
Some tax havens, such as Monaco and Jersey, have gone further, inviting
foreign banks and the nervous rich to settle. But Liechtenstein has severely
restricted immigration, fearing that its population of 29,000 and its tiny
banking and legal fraternities would be overwhelmed.
Thus, even though people such as Mr Maxwell set up trusts and foundations in
Liechtenstein, the assets owned by those entities, including cash and
securities, are usually located elsewhere. Mr Werner Keicher, a
Liechtenstein-based director of the Maxwell Foundation, has stated that
there are no Maxwell assets in the principality.
Because one of the key features of the Liechtenstein package is secrecy, the
principality has inevitably attracted some shady characters.
In the 1970s, some of the affairs of Michele Sindona, the Italian financier,
were traced to Liechtenstein. In the Chiasso affair, a manager of Credit
Suisse embezzled SFr2.2bn of clients' money in the late 1970s and hid it in
Liechtenstein. Two years ago, Mr Christian Norgren, a prominent European
banker, was caught routing insider purchases of US shares through a
Liechtenstein establishment.
At the beginning of this year, evidence emerged that Mr Maxwell was using at
least one of his Liechtenstein-based foundations to conceal the source of
share purchases aimed at propping up the share price of Maxwell
Communications (MCC).
Under Liechtenstein law, a foundation's purposes, which are usually
charitable, must be specified precisely. Moreover, a foundation cannot
normally engage in business activities. Although terms of the Maxwell
foundations are secret, it is unlikely that they would permit the kind of
share-support operations apparently carried out last spring.
While Liechtenstein will not help foreign tax agencies, it will co-operate
with foreign authorities in criminal investigations. The banking and legal
fraternities accept new clients only on referral from reputable banks and
solicitors.
In the Maxwell case, no one in Liechtenstein had any suspicions about the
foundations. Indeed, until late last year, the trust firm that looked after
Maxwell was much envied for having such a prestigious client.
With the trend towards European political and economic integration, there is
anxiety in Liechtenstein that it will soon have to give up its tax-haven
status and/or open its doors to foreign bankers and solicitors.

FT  06 JUN 92 / BP division to close Scots HQ: Anger over government
assurances - 350 jobs to be lost - Labour seeks meeting with ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum's exploration arm yesterday announced it was to close its
Glasgow headquarters with the loss of 350 jobs, prompting a row over alleged
breaches of guarantees given when BP took over the offices from Britoil, the
former state-controlled oil company.
About 300 workers will be transferred over the next year to Aberdeen, where
the majority of BP's 5,000 Scottish employees are based and which will
become an integrated headquarters for exploration and production across
Europe. A further 350 people will be made redundant.
Mr John Browne, the chief executive, said that the move was prompted by the
need to cut costs, and the shift towards smaller and less economic fields in
the North Sea.
BP Exploration is the largest operator in the UK sector of the North Sea
with an output of nearly half a million barrels of oil a day.
Mr Fergus MacLeod, industry analyst at County NatWest in Edinburgh, said the
action was expected, and was likely to save BP about Pounds 50m a year.
The St Vincent Street offices in Glasgow passed to BP when the company
acquired Britoil in a Pounds 2.5bn takeover in 1988. Sir Peter Walters, then
BP chairman, gave written assurances to Sir Peter Middleton, then permanent
secretary at the Treasury, including that Glasgow would become the business
headquarters of the combined BP/Britoil upstream business in the UK. The
assurances were repeated in the Commons by Mr Nigel Lawson, then chancellor.
Mr Donald Dewar, shadow Scottish secretary, said yesterday's announcement
was a 'flagrant breach' of those guarantees. 'The guarantees were worthless
and the deal sold on a false prospectus. This raises major issues of
political honour and the way this government deals with multinationals.' He
is to press for a meeting with ministers.
Mr George Galloway, Labour MP for Glasgow Hillhead, said BP were 'corporate
liars'.
The government initially retained a 'golden share' in Britoil, but redeemed
that in 1990. Ministers said at the time that they were happy BP had
fulfilled its pledges on Britoil.
BP said Abbey National Life had agreed to lease two of the Glasgow
building's six floors as a life assurance centre and was considering whether
to take further space.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Docklands move plan arouses resistance
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 1,000 civil servants from the Department of the Environment held
an angry meeting in London yesterday to protest against plans to move them
from Westminster to Docklands.
The meeting, organised by four Civil Service unions, heard calls for a
campaign - including industrial action - to stop the move.
'Hell, no, we won't go]' said one civil servant to loud applause, echoing
the slogan of US draft dodgers during the Vietnam War. Another demanded that
staff unwilling to move to Docklands should be found alternative work in
other Whitehall departments.
Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said on Tuesday that Canary
Wharf was among three sites under consideration for rehousing civil servants
from its Marsham Street headquarters which are due for demolition. The other
two are Harbour Exchange and East India Dock, both on the Isle of Dogs.
Speakers at the protest meeting queried the economics of the move. Mr Paul
Noon of the Institution of Professionals, Managers and Scientists challenged
ministers to publish the figures that the government claimed showed
relocation to Docklands was good value for the taxpayer.
Another 3,000 civil servants are expected to join the Environment Department
staff in Docklands, from, among others, transport and radiocommunications.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Silence is Arab legacy from Six-Day War: The reluctance in
Egypt to examine Nasser's role in the 1967 defeat
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TONY WALKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN the Arab world, and in Egypt in particular, it is known as the naqba, or
disaster. People are not obliged to be any more specific when referring to
the 1967 Six-Day war in which the Arab armies were humiliated and swathes of
Arab territory fell under Israeli control.
While Israelis dance triumphantly before the Wailing Wall to celebrate the
25th anniversary of the reunification of Jerusalem under Jewish control, the
Arab world remains quiet about a bitter memory that time has not erased.
In Egypt, the normally voluble press tip-toes around the issue, and retired
public figures who had some role in the war find it inconvenient to respond
to journalist's requests for interviews.
Like a family scandal there is a conscious attempt to pretend that it didn't
really happen. Remarkably, in the past 25 years there has been no serious
investigation of the steps which led towards the war.
'If was a very, very humiliating war,' says the revisionist Egyptian
historian, Dr Abdel Azim Ramadan. 'What happened in June 1967 had never
happened throughout Egypt's whole history. Egypt had a big army, a strong
army and a lot of weapons, and that all disappeared not in six days, but in
a few hours.' Dr Ramadan, a university teacher and newspaper columnist, is
one of very few Egyptian intellectuals who has tried to deal squarely with
1967, and with the responsibility for the disaster of President Gamal Abdel
Nasser.
His book, Destruction of Idols: The Story of the 1967 War, ascribes the
defeat to the 'rottenness' of a system which accorded dictatorial power to
the very few.
He says: 'The June war was the outcome of a political order which could
produce nothing except defeat . . . faults couldn't be rectified because
only criticism can rectify faults and no-one could write or say anything
against the regime without getting heavy punishment.'
Criticism of Mr Nasser, a towering figure in the Arab world before the war,
is painful for prominent Egyptians even today, since many were caught up in
the nationalist fervour of the time. There is a tendency, therefore, to
excuse his mistakes and find other scapegoats, among them Field Marshal
Abdel Hakim Amer, the military commander, who later committed suicide (some
insist he was murdered).
But even for those most protective of Mr Nasser's historical reputation,
including his confidant, the newspaper editor and columnist Mohammed
Hassanein Heikal, it is impossible to disguise the dimensions of Mr Nasser's
political mistakes in the weeks before the war, and his under-estimation of
Israeli military capabilities.
It was Mr Nasser who, by withdrawing permission for the stationing of a UN
deterrent force on Egyptian soil, by blockading the Strait of Tiran to
Israeli shipping and by re-deploying Egyptian troops in the Sinai, gave
Israel the pretext for its devastating pre-emptive strike, its casus belli.
It was also Mr Nasser's decision, under pressure from both his Soviet
quartermasters and the US, to refrain from firing the first shot, thus
refusing the element of surprise. In the event, the war was effectively over
in a few hours early on June 5 after Egypt's air force was demolished on the
ground.
Whatever the reasons for Mr Nasser's folly, and there is some evidence that
he hoped the gravity of the situation would quickly attract international
intervention, as was the case in the 1956 Suez crisis, the 1967 war marked a
watershed in Arab affairs.
Mr Tahsin Bashir, a former spokesman for Mr Nasser, believes the Nasser
revolution, with its secular Pan-Arabist flavour, was killed in June 1967.
The death of Nasserism contributed to the re-birth of religious
fundamentalism across the region, and a surge in 'Palestinianism', as the
Palestinians came to the painful conclusion they were deluding themselves in
relying for their salvation on Arab regimes.
On the odd occasions that mainstream Arab commentators have sought to deal
with the legacy of 1967, they have not been able to resist reference to
'conspiracy'.
Thus, to this day, attempts are made to explain away the disaster by
referring to an alleged collusion between the US and Israel, but no strong
evidence supports a contention that senior US officials were party to a plot
to entrap Mr Nasser.
Indeed, some Arab writers believe an attachment to a conspiracy theory to
explain the mistakes of 1967 is foolish and counter-productive. Mr Gamil
Mattar, a columnist in the London-based Arab daily, Al Hayat, writes: 'Some
of the Arab politicians, especially those who were the main players, have
deliberately used the term plot. The word plot is always used by those who
have been politically or militarily defeated to cover up for their
inadequacy.'

ANZ Grindlays, the Australian-owned bank, yesterday bowed to a request from
the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, to set aside more than Rs4bn
(Pounds 77m) to cover its potential exposure to the Bombay securities
scandal.
However, Grindlays, India's biggest foreign-owned bank, continued to deny
any liability to repay the money, which is being claimed by the National
Housing Bank, itself a subsidiary of the central bank.
Grindlays said it had told the central bank that it would 'take such steps
as are required to ensure that sufficient resources are available to meet
any liabilities that are determined without prejudice to (the bank's) rights
and contentions'.
According to the Reserve Bank, Grindlays paid five cheques from the National
Housing Bank, totalling more than Rs4bn, into a current account it ran for
Mr Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of the affair, even though the
cheques were made out to Grindlays itself.
The bank claims that it acted in line with normal practice in Bombay's
interbank markets.
Mr Mehta yesterday appeared before magistrates in Bombay charged with
funnelling bank money illegally into the Bombay Stock Exchange, along with
nine others.
This followed two more arrests earlier in the day, of Mr C L Khemani, deputy
managing director of the State Bank of India, and an assistant manager from
the NHB.
'This is the biggest ever fraud committed in this country,' the prosecutor,
Mr MP Johari, told a packed courtroom as Mr Mehta made his first court
appearance.
Hinting at the possibility of more allegations to come, Mr Johari said that
illegal stock dealings uncovered by investigators were only the tip of the
iceberg.
All the accused were remanded in police custody for 14 days.
Meanwhile, Standard Chartered, which the central bank says has an exposure
of Rs10.55bn in the affair, is understood to have been in talks throughout
the week to recover assets from brokers who received the money.
The negotiations are so far believed to have been unsuccessful, and the bank
is coming under increasing pressure to take legal action to recover assets -
a step that could involve it in a lengthy dispute through India's
notoriously slow judicial system.
Mr R Janakiraman, the central bank deputy governor whose investigation has
revealed that Rs30.8bn in all was diverted from the banking system, said he
had traced the money into the accounts of various brokers.
Mr Janakiraman has not yet discovered how the money was used, but said in an
interview yesterday that he believed very little, if any, of the money had
been taken out of the country.
Mr S Venkitaraman, central bank governor, said: 'We are acting on some
leads, and feel confident we will be able to recover assets.'
He denied putting pressure on Grindlays to set money aside because he wanted
to protect his own subsidiary, the National Housing Bank, but accepted there
was a potential conflict of interest in the central bank owning and
regulating banks.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE politicians were locked in intense negotiations last night over the
passage through the Diet of a bill which would allow Japanese troops to
serve in United Nations peacekeeping missions, writes Stefan Wagstyl.
The bill, which went through the lower house last December, passed through a
key upper house committee amid uproar early yesterday.
More than 500 people demonstrated outside the Diet during the committee's
night-time sitting. Two small bombs exploded outside the office of one
member of the ruling Liberal Democratic party and outside the home of
another.
The bill would allow Japanese troops to take part in peacekeeping missions,
but not in front-line roles, such as monitoring ceasefires, only in support
roles, such as transport.
Divisions in the Diet reflect the anxiety which the bill has caused: while
some Japanese support the government's case that Japan must play a bigger
world role, others argue the bill infringes the country's pacifist
constitution.

<TEXT>
FOREIGN direct investment in Japan soared 56 per cent to Dollars 4.3bn
(Pounds 2.36bn) in the year to the end of March as foreign companies took
advantage of the fall in Japanese land prices to expand sales outlets,
writes Stefan Wagstyl in Tokyo.
Figures published yesterday by the finance ministry showed foreign companies
increased investments in Japan to a record level. They were particularly
active in buying distribution companies, warehouses, and wholesale and
retail outlets.
Bankers specialising in inward investment said foreign direct investment in
1992-93 could rise further as US and European companies saw the drop in
Japanese asset prices and the slow-down in the Japanese economy as a rare
opportunity to invest.
Meanwhile the ministry's report also showed Japanese direct investment
overseas fell sharply for the second year in succession - by 26.9 per cent
to Dollars 41.6bn. Japanese companies' appetite for foreign investment was
curbed by constraints on fund-raising caused by the fall in the Tokyo stock
market, the recession in world property markets and the global economic
slow-down.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Japan's slowdown boosts trade surplus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S April current account surplus rose by 22.1 per cent over a year ago
to Dollars 9.99bn (Pounds 5.5bn), reflecting a strong growth in exports and
a slower increase in imported goods.
The rising surplus continues the trend of the past year, although the pace
of increase has slowed, with April's surplus falling to Dollars 12.39bn, on
a seasonally adjusted basis, from Dollars 15.51bn in March.
Trade partners may be relieved to see the pace of growth in Japan's current
account surplus slowing, but there is no sign yet of a reversal in the
underlying trends.
Japan's current account surplus had been on a declining trend until last
year when imports began to fall and exports increased as a result, in part,
of the slowdown of Japan's economy.
Japan's Ministry of Finance said the 13 per cent year-on-year rise in
exports to Dollars 26.58bn was supported by a 20 per cent rise in car
exports, and increases in semiconductors and machinery exports. Imports rose
by 11.1 per cent to Dollars 16.58bn, boosted by large increases of food and
textile imports. The official said the rise in the trade surplus was
influenced by changing prices more than changing volumes of imports and
exports.
Japan last month returned to its usual position as a net exporter of
long-term capital after many months of importing capital. The long-term
capital account showed a net deficit of Dollars 3.43bn, compared to a
surplus of Dollars 8.84bn in March. While foreigners' net purchases of
Japanese equities fell from Dollars 2.63bn to Dollars 1.37bn and net
purchases of bonds worth Dollars 1.63bn in March turned into net sales of
Dollars 3.65bn in April, Japanese investors turned into net buyers of
foreign bonds, worth Dollars 4.88bn in April, compared with sales of a
similar amount in March.

<TEXT>
US investigator Mr Jules Kroll has appealed for international help in
tracking down vast sums of hard currency stashed abroad by Moscow's former
communist regime.
Mr Kroll yesterday appealed to central banks, governments and businessmen to
help find the money, which he said could be worth more than the western aid
pledged to the former Soviet republics.
At a time when the west was considering giving Russia and the other former
Soviet republics Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13bn) in aid, uncovering the funds
would be 'one of the cheapest forms of aid' it could offer, he said.
Mr Kroll helped trace the missing Marcos millions and was also involved in
tracking down the assets of Haiti dictator 'Baby Doc' Duvalier.
His consultancy, Kroll Associates, is hunting for three types of funds:
profits sent abroad illegally by state-owned enterprises; bribes paid by
foreign companies to Russian officials for concluding deals on terms
unfavourable to the state; and public funds transferred abroad by the
now-banned Communist party.
'This is going to require some government-to-government negotiations,' Mr
Kroll said. 'If you leave it to a bank that has possession (of illicit
funds), you're going to have a long wait.'
The money is believed to be in bank accounts in Cyprus, Greece, Switzerland,
Austria, Germany, the UK, Jersey, the US, and any other countries where
beneficiaries either had 'trusted friends' or 'consultancies'.
'There's no doubt we are talking about billions,' Mr Kroll said, adding that
it was impossible to be precise.
In the four months since his consultancy was hired by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
Russian first deputy prime minister, it has found 22 bank accounts of a
suspect nature, all set up since 1985, although none of the money has been
retrieved.
Mr Kroll and his team are paying special attention to commodity trading  -
particularly that involving imports of agro-industrial products, where
foreign sellers have an unusually high profit margin.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Ross Perot, the prospective independent presidential candidate, would
drastically cut imports from Japan and believes the free trade agreement
with Mexico would undermine US manufacturing.
In the most specific interview he has yet given on economic and trade
policy, he told the Los Angeles Times that 'we cannot be a superpower if we
cannot manufacture here'.
Though describing himself as 'a fair and free trader', he asserted that 'the
agreements we've cut with countries around the world are not balanced at
all'. Describing US trade with Japan as 'a tilted deck', he said he would
tell the Japanese 'in a nice, diplomatic way, we'll take the same deal on
cars we've given you'.
However, he did say he thought the US could learn from Japan by 'targeting
industries of the future and making sure sacrifice in corporations starts at
the top'.
Free trade with Mexico inevitably meant the export of US jobs, he said.
'Labour is a 25-year-old with little or no health-care expenses working for
a dollar an hour. You cannot compete with that in the USA, period,' he
asserted. Although he added that his attitude towards trade policy was not
set in concrete.
So far this year, the sort of economic nationalism represented by Mr Pat
Buchanan on the Republican side and Mr Jerry Brown for the Democrats has
been indifferently received. Both President Bush and Governor Clinton have
generally opposed protectionism. But Mr Perot is a more potent populist and
his arguments could well force the issue back to the forefront of the
national debate.
So may some of his reflections on domestic economic policy. He believes the
country's future lies with small business, which he says are being starved
of credit. He dismissed US big business as part of the establishment. 'The
status quo works for them right now and I'm talking about major, major
changes,' he said.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Danes' Maastricht vote 'will jolt Irish': Prime minister
seeks to rally liberals to Yes-vote by re-establishing link with freer
access to abortion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IRISH voters will be jolted into giving greater support to the Maastricht
treaty in the wake of its rejection by Denmark, according to Mr Albert
Reynolds, Ireland's prime minister.
Yet the Irish leader revealed some uncertainty about the outcome of the June
18 referendum on Maastricht by simultaneously seeking to rally liberals in
favour of freer access to abortions abroad - an issue the government has
struggled to disentangle from the European debate.
Mr Reynolds made what appeared to be a pitch for the liberal vote by saying
that a 'yes' vote on June 18 would mean Ireland had pronounced on the
controversial issue of whether Irish women had the right to information on
abortion and the right to travel abroad to terminate pregnancies, in line
with EC law on freedom of information and movement.
'On the 18th of June, a 'yes' vote ensures your right to travel,' Mr
Reynolds said, and 'the law officers can see that Irish people will have
spoken on travel and information.'
His judgment is that on June 18 the Irish will weigh the risk of isolation
revealed by Denmark's stance. 'There was a certain element of complacency
building in the (pro-Maastricht) campaign. But this will get us a better
result than had the Danes voted 'yes',' Mr Reynolds said yesterday.
'The eyes of Europe will be upon us on the 18th of June and Ireland will
respond to that challenge. Ireland will raise the flag for Europe,' the
prime minister insisted. As the first country to make a decision on
Maastricht after the Danish debacle, and the only other country apart from
France which will hold a referendum on the treaty, Ireland has become the
unwitting repository of the European Community's hopes for the beginings of
a way out of the Dane-provoked crisis.
EC foreign ministers decided in Oslo on Thursday that rapid ratification of
the treaty was the only way to stop the European Union project buckling.
The issue of abortion - proscribed by the Irish constitution - entered the
European debate when the previous government inserted a protocol in the
Maastricht treaty declaring that nothing in it overrode this constitutional
clause. The Reynolds government, however, opted for a separate referendum on
abortion this year.
Even without the Irish leader's surprising re-linking of the two issues, EC
and Irish lawyers reckon that even a 'yes' vote on June 18 might be open to
legal challenge if Maastricht - which as drafted requires approval by all 12
EC states - is altered by a single comma. This might risk a new referendum
on the treaty colliding outright with the abortion issue.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Rise in jobless hurts Bush's poll chances
</HEADLINE>

   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP and unexpected increase in US unemployment has thrown new gloom onto
President George Bush's already tattered re-election campaign. The Labor
Department said yesterday the unemployment rate climbed in May to 7.5 per
cent, its highest level for eight years.
The statistics provided little encouragement for Mr Bush's efforts to win a
second term in the White House, which have rested largely on the hope that
the US economy would recover from recession in time for November's general
election.
It has frustrated Mr Bush and his advisers that voters feel the recession
more deeply than the economic data suggest, and that they have been slow to
recognise that recovery has begun.
In a press conference on Thursday, the president gloomily cited a private
poll in which 70 per cent of those questioned thought the economy was
getting worse, although gross domestic product, industrial production and
payroll employment were all increasing.
'I think most people would concede that my problems stem from this sluggish,
anaemic economy. I assume the American people are fair enough to give credit
when there's recovery,' Mr Bush said.
Some of the discrepancy between the apparently mild recession and the sharp
plunge in popular confidence was explained this week by a substantial
revision to past employment data.
The revised statistics show employment fell by 2.2m during the 18 month
recession, 30 per cent more than previous data had suggested.
Mr William Barron, acting commissioner of labor statistics, said jobs were
now being created, but too slowly to absorb the growth in the labour force.
The department said the number of jobs in the non-farm sector rose by 68,000
in May, to total 108.45m, continuing a slow upward trend evident since the
beginning of the year.
But 331,000 people entered the jobs market - many of them young people
leaving school or college - and Mr Barron said the labour force had grown by
1.8m in the last six months.
Only the service sector is creating new jobs, with jobs still being cut in
the retail sector, and manufacturing employment showing little change.
'Manufacturers are expanding hours, not payrolls,' said Mr Ed Yardeni,
economist at brokers C J Lawrence, who noted that the average factory
working week of 41.3 hours was at its highest level since 1966.

<TEXT>
SERB irregulars agreed last night to hand over Sarajevo airport to United
Nations forces so that humanitarian relief aid could be flown to the
embattled Balkan capital, the UN said, Reuter reports from Belgrade.
'It was agreed during talks today with all parties that the airport would be
handed over to UN forces as soon as the UN is ready to take over,' Shannon
Boyd, spokeswoman for the UN Protection Force, told Reuters.
Thousands of men, women and children have been trapped in Sarajevo, capital
of newly independent Bosnia-Hercegovina, by fighting between rebel Serb
forces and their Croat and Slav Moslem opponents.
Earlier in the day, pro-independence Bosnian forces ended a month-long
blockade of the strategic Marshal Tito barracks in Sarajevo, allowing 800
Yugoslav federal army soldiers and family members to be evacuated.
UN officials in Sarajevo termed the withdrawal 'a major breakthrough'.
However, Serb irregulars resumed shelling the city in the evening and
gunfire was reported to have hit the UN headquarters.
The US yesterday imposed a trade embargo on Yugoslavia in a tightening of
sanctions against the republic.
President George Bush signed an executive order prohibiting exports and
imports of goods between the US and Serbia and Montenegro, which make up the
federal republic of Yugoslavia. The order represented US compliance with UN
sanctions ordered last week against Serbia and Montenegro.
Serbia's rival political parties and nationalist movements yesterday began
jockeying for position as pressure on President Slobodan Milosevic to resign
gained momentum in the ruling establishment, writes Judy Dempsey in
Belgrade. In Mr Milosevic's ruling Serbian Socialist party, 14 deputies of
the parliamentary club yesterday broke ranks by withdrawing from the club.
The Socialists won the majority of parliamentary seats in last Sunday's
elections. The rival ultra-nationalist Radical party, led by Mr Vojislav
Seselj, won 33 of the 138 seats, which signals the the growing influence of
a militant, armed party in the republic.
Rapid fragmentation of Mr Milosevic's support is also taking place in the
Serbian Academy of Sciences, and Belgrade University, the cream of the
establishment and previously supporters. Forty-seven out of 90 academy
members present signed a petition demanding his resignation.

THE Danish government has 'no plans' for a new referendum on the Maastricht
Treaty but it could not be ruled out as a future option following the Danish
people's rejection of the treaty this week, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the
Danish foreign minister, said yesterday.
It would not be right to ignore the constitutional process which had led to
the rejection of the treaty, Mr Ellemann-Jensen said. But 'if circumstances
changed', the possibility of holding another referendum could be discussed
as one of a number of solutions to Denmark's predicament.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen, in Oslo for a meeting of Nato foreign ministers,
repeated what he told his European Community colleagues on Thursday, that
'all options' remained open. 'We will have to consider what we want to do
during the summer recess and take stock of the situation in the autumn. For
the moment, the time is not ripe for decisions.'
Denmark and its people still regarded themselves as an integral part of this
process, which was supported by all political parties.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen said the decision by the other European Community member
states to proceed with ratification of the Maastricht treaty did not come as
a surprise to the Danish government. 'We told the voters that that would be
the case and they voted with their eyes open.'
It was also made clear at Thursday's emergency meeting that Denmark's 11
partners were not ready to renegotiate the treaty, a fact that had been
noted by Denmark.
He was grateful to Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, for
distancing himself personally from a Commission discussion paper which was
reported to have expressed the opinion that small countries would 'lose
influence' in the European union projected in the Maastricht treaty.
This report is said to have played an important role in persuading the
Danish electorate to reject the treaty, but Mr Ellemann-Jensen said he was
satisfied by Mr Delors' explanation that it had been prepared 'at a low
level' and did not represent his views.
'I certainly hope that Mr Delors will be reappointed,' he added.
While Danish politicians try to sort out the country's relationship with the
EC, ordinary Danes are astonished to find themselves in the spotlight,
Hilary Barnes reports from Copenhagen.
'It suddenly felt important to be a Dane,' said a university student
yesterday, a Yes-voter who was appalled at the EC crisis which his fellow
voters have brought about.
The vote contained a strong element of protest against the political
establishment. Some of the No-voters are having regrets. A waitress said she
voted No out of general dislike of Denmark's powers-that-be, feeling
confident that Yes votes would prevail. Enthusiastic opponents were
convinced they were striking a blow for national independence.

Lloyds' withdrawal makes it almost certain that Midland will be acquired by
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation, which earlier this week improved
the terms of its recommended offer for the UK bank to Pounds 3.9bn.
Yesterday's news stunned the stock market and Midland's share price fell 21p
to 446p, compared with the 469p value of Hongkong Bank's shares and cash
offer.
Lloyds' decision to withdraw its proposed offer, which had been referred to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission, was made at a board meeting yesterday
morning.
Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds' chief executive and the architect of the takeover
plan, admitted that he was disappointed at the outcome. He said he had
recommended to the board that Lloyds should withdraw. Only four days
earlier, after Hongkong Bank raised its offer, Mr Pitman still believed his
bank had a chance of buying Midland.
He changed his mind after his financial advisers - the stockbroker Hoare
Govett and two merchant banks, Baring Brothers and Lloyds Merchant Bank -
told him Lloyds would have to offer more than 520p for each Midland share to
have any chance of acquiring the bank.
Mr Pitman said he believed such a price was too high. The advisers did not
give him this information in preliminary form until Thursday morning.
Sir Jeremy Morse, Lloyds' chairman, said he and Mr Pitman did not take a
definitive view on this question of how much their bank could pay until just
before the board meeting, which began at 9.45am yesterday.
Sir Jeremy said there was no question of Mr Pitman or any other board member
stepping down as a result of the collapse of the takeover attempt. 'It does
not compromise him (Mr Pitman) or us,' Sir Jeremy said.
Mr Pitman said he did not believe Lloyds' reputation would be damaged
severely by the failure of the takeover attempt. He would press on with a
strategy of cutting costs - staff numbers are currently being reduced by 250
a month - and attempting to increase income by selling more financial
services through its network of 2,000 branches.
Sir Jeremy questioned whether Midland would be equipped to meet the big
challenges ahead under its likely new owner, Hongkong Bank. He said Midland
faced 'quite a struggle'.
Lloyds made banking history on April 28, when it became the first UK
clearing bank to make a hostile proposal to buy another bank at the heart of
the UK financial system.
Sir Jeremy has always said his bank's intentions towards Midland were not
hostile but he admitted that if Midland saw Lloyds intervention as hostile -
as Midland did - then it was probably fair to describe it in such a way. The
Bank of England was also unhappy that there should be such an aggressive
contest between two banks, Lloyds and Hongkong Bank, for control of Midland.
The Bank has been convinced throughout the contest that Lloyds would be
blocked by the MMC and therefore could not understand its motives in making
the proposed offer.
However, Sir Jeremy said the Bank went out of its way not to influence the
course of events.
Lloyds' attempt to buy Midland has caused a storm at Westminster because it
planned to close 1,000 bank branches and cut staff by 20,000 if it succeeded
in acquiring Midland.
Two weeks ago, Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade,
referred the proposed takeover for scrutiny by the MMC, the UK competition
authority. The MMC has since been bombarded with submissions from different
groups of banking customers - including lobbies representing small
businesses, farmers, retailers and consumers  - who were concerned that a
Lloyds acquisition of Midland would have an adverse effect on competition.
Lloyds had been working on plans to buy Midland since the beginning of 1991.
However, not until late November did Sir Jeremy ask Midland's chairman, Sir
Peter Walters, if he would enter into secret negotiations on a takeover.
However, Hongkong Bank already had a 14.9 per cent stake in Midland, which
it had bought at the end of 1987. When it bought the stake, it had hoped to
buy Midland three years later, but that plan was subsequently put on ice.
Hongkong Bank's interest in Midland revived when it learned of Lloyds'
approach. Midland then carried out secret talks with both and on March 13 it
opted for Hongkong Bank, because it was convinced that a bid by Lloyds would
be blocked by the competition authorities.
However, Lloyds was so convinced of the commercial logic of buying Midland,
that it broke its silence on its intentions and said it wanted to buy
Midland. But it said it would back out if its bid was referred to the MMC
and Hongkong Bank's was not. In the event, however, it did not back away
after the MMC reference of its proposal - even though Hongkong Bank faced no
such scrutiny. Sir Jeremy said yesterday that Lloyds had initially decided
to press on because Hongkong Bank's initial offer for Midland was
'inadequate'.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Pensions law to be put under scrutiny
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN INDEPENDENT commission to examine UK pensions legislation and recommend
reforms is to be announced by the government on Monday.
Pressure for pensions reform has risen close to the top of the political
agenda since it was discovered that more than Pounds 400m was missing from
the pension funds of companies controlled by the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
The government's review will examine, among other things, ownership of
pension fund surpluses, the feasibility of a compensation scheme for funds
which fail, and whether trust law is suitable for such funds.
Meanwhile, it emerged yesterday that Maxwell company pension schemes have
taken the first legal steps to recover missing assets from banks and
financial institutions. Lawyers for Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme
have filed two separate actions naming five institutions from which it is
seeking up to Pounds 88m in compensation for assets which disappeared
following unauthorised stock lending.
The suits charge breach of fund management agreements and say fund managers
failed to obtain clear permission of pension fund trustees before they
followed out instructions to loan stock.
The first suit, which names Myers, charges that unauthorised stock lending
led to losses of Pounds 11.3m and Pounds 38.5m from the two fund managers
respectively. Each managed a portion of the Common Investment Scheme, a pool
of the assets of the five Maxwell company pension plans. The suit also names
Lehman Brothers which it says received a majority of proceeds from the stock
lending activities.
The second suit makes claims totalling Pounds 68.8m against Bank of America
National Trust and Savings Association, which acted as custodian for shares,
as well as Credit Suisse which received proceeds from alleged unauthorised
stock lending. Laywers for the MGN pension scheme are charging that BIM had
no authorisation from the scheme's trustees to instruct other fund managers
to engage in stock lending.
The independent commission's review will closely follow that suggested in a
report issued in March by the cross-party parliamentary social security
committee. Several of its recommendations were specifically aimed at
preventing the type of unauthorised stock lending described in the MGN
pension scheme's suit against its fund managers.
The committee made no specific recommendation on the ownership of surplus.
Any effort to prevent companies from putting pension fund surpluses to their
own use is likely to be fiercely resisted by industry.
The new commission is expected to issue a preliminary report within six to
nine months.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Reichmann may bid to win back Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PAUL REICHMANN, founder of the troubled property developer Olympia &amp;
York, is planning a bid to regain control of Canary Wharf, the east London
property development which is in administration under UK insolvency
procedures.
Mr Reichmann, whose family owns Olympia &amp; York, is in talks with a number of
powerful investors, whom he hopes can be persuaded to join him in a takeover
bid for the project, according to a financier with a close knowledge of O&amp;Y.
Four separate options are being considered by him, all of which will include
a commitment to provide funding for extension of the Jubilee Line
underground link.
Mr Reichmann is due to meet administrators from the accounting firm Ernst &amp;
Young in London next week to discuss his plans for Canary Wharf.
Some bank creditors, owed hundreds of millions of pounds as a result of
their involvement in Europe's biggest property development, may be angry at
the possibility that he may regain control of Canary Wharf.
On the other hand, tenants are likely to welcome the continued involvement
of O&amp;Y, whose reputation as a landlord remains unsullied by its financial
difficulties.
Mr Reichmann is believed to be confident that opposition will come from only
a handful of creditors.
His bid would provide sufficient capital to complete the project's first two
stages without any new money from the present Canary Wharf lenders.
It would also allow banks to reduce their exposure to the project, but at
the price of taking some loss on any loans withdrawn.
On Wednesday, Mr Reichmann met the chairman and chief executives of eight
banks with heavy exposure to O&amp;Y.
The meeting, held in Toronto, was described by one of the bankers as
friendly.
The appointment of administrators at Canary Wharf 10 days ago was a severe
personal blow to Mr Reichmann. The project was by far the most ambitious
undertaken by O&amp;Y, and Mr Reichmann has overseen every detail of its
construction.
Before its liquidity crisis arose in February, O&amp;Y was confident it was on
the verge of a breakthrough in its efforts to attract tenants to Canary
Wharf. Such a breakthrough could have secured the project's future.
Two UK financial institutions were due to sign leases by the end of April
for a total of 400,000 sq ft of office space.
One of them was Barclays, the UK bank which is also one of the leading
lenders to the project.
One of Mr Reichmann's concerns in his comeback effort is that he may be
outbid by another party, such as Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate which has
indicated it is considering a bid.
Ernst &amp; Young said yesterday that no more than 'half a dozen serious players
worldwide' would be interested in rescuing the project.
The administrators said the project had so far cost Pounds 1.5bn. Unsecured
creditors, including building contractors, are owed Pounds 50m.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Hanson plans to float Jacuzzi as part of Pounds 700m asset
sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HANSON, the Anglo-US con-glomerate, is planning to sell most of its non-core
businesses, which it values at more than Pounds 700m.
In a departure from its traditional method of selling companies, Hanson is
considering floating off majority stakes in its US non-core businesses,
which include Jacuzzi, the whirlpool bath and hot tub manufacturer, and
Beazer's US housebuilding interests.
Mr David Clarke, chief executive of Hanson Industries, the company's North
American arm, yesterday said, as well as Jacuzzi, the US companies earmarked
for disposal had been packaged into three groups of housebuilding, consumer
products, recreation and leisure.
Hanson is likely to keep a small stake in the four groups, which are valued
by its advisers at more than a Dollars 1bn (Pounds 546m).
In the UK, Hanson has earmarked small consumer and industrial companies
worth about Pounds 200m for trade sales.
The disposals, which are expected to begin shortly, are designed to allow
Hanson to concentrate on the management of seven core businesses which it is
keen to expand. They are Peabody Coal, Cavenham Forest, Beazer USA, Grove
Industries and SCM Chemicals in the US and Imperial Tobacco and building
products groups, including ARC and London Brick, in the UK.
The US flotations will be the first since Hanson's controversial flotation
of 52 per cent of Smith Corona, the typewriter manufacturer, for Dollars 21
a share in July 1989.
Shortly after the flotation, which raised Dollars 386m for Hanson, Smith
Corona announced a deterioration in its sales, and the share price collapsed
to Dollars 5. Yesterday in New York they were trading at 9 5/8 .
Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries, said: 'The lesson to be learnt
from Smith Corona is that the offer price was pitched too high.'
Mr Clarke said the four groups contained strong brand names, such as Tommy
Armour golf equipment and Farberware cookware, with earnings growth
potential.
He believed the publicity surrounding the flotations would be good for
Hanson, which is aiming to increase the proportion of US-based shareholders
from 21 per cent to 30 per cent in the next few years.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Collecting: A rude awakening - An attempt to put Belgium on
the auction map
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BELGIAN auction scene, the sleepy part of an otherwise highly active art
market, is in for a rude French awakening on June 15 when Paris auctioneer
Jean-Louis Picard wields the gavel for the first time ever in the Esplanade
du Cinquantenaire, a museum building near the centre of Brussels.
Picard is heading a new auction firm, Euro-auction, set up under Belgian
company law and which is an attempt to create a new north European practice.
Picard, who split from his longstanding auction partner Jacques Thajan last
year, inherited the company's Brussels office as part of a settlement. His
main associates are Belgian designer Michel Wittamer and Princess Wauthier
de Ligne. Euro-auction will be using Wittamer's family home, an Art Noveau
mansion in Brusselsdesigned by the architect Horta, in as company
headquarters and showroom.
The sale, aimed at attracting the prosperous and art-minded Germans, Dutch
and Belgians who made this year's Maastricht art and antiques fair such a
success, is deliberately a mixed bag with which Picard intends to test the
market. It comprises 292 lots including Oriental art objects, primitive art,
tapestries, a handful of old paintings, glassware, 18th to 19th century
French and Belgian furniture and 100 pieces of
'Belgium is a country of collectors, of collections, of art lovers and of
considerable private fortunes. Brussels itself is a very important north
European pole with extraordinarily good communications between Britain and
Germany. And it is next door to Holland and Luxembourg,' Picard said.
Brussels also offers the advantage over Paris of a bare minimum of legal red
tape and a 6 per cent rate of VAT on objects sold at auction instead of the
crippling French rate of 18.6 per cent, which applies to everything except
'original works of art.' Belgian auctions rarely bother with catalogues and
are notorious for the inadequacy of their research and the absence of
guarantees and expert descriptions. So Picard, who says his long-term
ambition is to push the auction scene in Brussels to a level comparable with
that of Paris, has published a proper catalogue in French and Flemish and
recruited the services of 10 Paris art experts, all leading specialists in
their fields.
Picard's initiative is being viewed sceptically by many of his Parisian
colleagues. But his enthusiasm for the Belgian market is shared by the
Cologne-based auction company Lempertz, which held its second sale of
primitive art in Brussels, and Sotheby's. The Amsterdam branch of the
British firm is organising its second Belgian sale on June 16 and 17 (it
arranged the dates to avoid a clash with Picard) in the Chateau de Beloeil
near Mons, home to one of the country's most spectacular and most visited
art collections.
Prince de Ligne, who lives in the castle, needs money to have his rooms
repaired. Inspired by the highly successful three-day sale Sotheby's
organised at Castle Howard in Yorkshire last November, the prince contacted
his cousin, Count Henri de Limburg-Stirum, head of the office Sotheby's
opened in Brussels 13 years ago, to see if it could arrange something
suitable.
A spate of chateau auctions comprising objects of dubious provenance, caused
Belgian authorities to outlaw them and Prince de Ligne and Sotheby's had to
apply to a government commission for a legal dispensation in order to hold
theirs. The sale comprises 400 lots. Sotheby's says the prince is only
selling a few 'not very high quality' pictures, pieces of glass, porcelain
and furniture to finance the restoration of his chateau.
Most items have been brought in from Belgium. Germany, Britain, Denmark and
Holland and the bulk of the sale is 17th to 19th century furniture,
including a 19th century neo-classical Russian suite, a rare Belgian 18th
century console table (estimate BFr600,000 (Pounds 2,823) to BFr700,000) a
French Napoleon III desk estimated at BFr1m to BFr1.2m and some good-quality
Biedermeier pieces.
The sale also includes 80 German and Flemish Old Master paintings, a large
selection of French and German porcelain, 200 engravings by 19th century
Belgian artist Felicien Rops and five 17th century Brussels tapestries. Two
of the latter, depicting scenes from the life of Roman emperor Constantine,
and based on cartoons by Rubens, come from the collection of the Duke of
Hamilton and used to hang in Holyrood House in Edinburgh.
Sotheby's philosophy for this sale, according to Count Henri de
Limburg-Stirum, was to attract buyers by accumulating a large number of
good-quality items in one place.
'The advantage of the chateau is it attracts collectors. The mixture of
Sotheby's, the Chateau de Beloeil and Prince de Ligne is a potent one which
will work to the benefit of all concerned. As for our future in Belgium, I
can only say European policy is being permanently reviewed, although our
north European base is Amsterdam and I don't really see us holding rival
auctions here. The average Belgian, however, if you don't me saying so, is a
more enthusiastic art buyer than the average Briton,' the count said.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Collecting: Taste of the unexpected - Two London galleries
celebrate special anniversaries this summer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO LONDON galleries celebrate anniversaries this summer. To mark its 175th
year, Agnew's shows some 50 works of art chosen to emphasise the perhaps
unexpected range of the gallery's activities (June 9-July 24).
The company offers paintings from Fra Angelico panels to a cool, Cubist
Braque, Old Master drawings, sculpture and a group of prints that extend
from Piranesi capricci to Jasper Johns' flags. British works, from
Gainsborough and Zoffany to John Wonnacott, take in a clutch of Turner
watercolours plus a Venetian oil that, initially valued at Dollars 25m,
(Pounds 14.1m) is thought to be the most expensive picture on sale in the
world.
Those already in possession of the anniversary catalogue will be
disappointed not to find the portraits by Sebastiano and Goya, the
Giaquinto, Tintoretto's Desecent from the Cross and The Sleeping Shepherd by
Samuel Palmer. Agnew's, however, is pleased to count them among eight works
already sold. Any holes on the walls are to be filled by a pair of Guardis
and an Aert van der Neer skating scene that has not been on the market since
the 19th century and has found itself back at Agnew's once more.
As that show closes, The Leger Galleries open with a predominantly loan
exhibition of Samuel Palmer which marks a century of art dealing (until July
24). All 29 works have a Leger provenance. Palmer is an inspired choice for
a centenary show, given Harold Leger's fondness for an artist who has become
one of the nation's most beloved landscape painters. It is also a courageous
choice given that Leger was famously duped in the 1970s by four of Keating's
ingenious Palmer pastiches.
With the glowing exception of the oil and tempera The Shearers which is on
loan from the Tate, the show comprises watercolours and drawings. The
selection is striking too for its emphasis not on the visionary works of the
Shoreham years but on the less familiar late works which, as Raymond Lister
argues in the catalogue, are less intense but rarely less romantic or poetic
idylls of the English countryside. Palmer enthusiasts should not miss the
treat.
Further up Bond Street, The Fine Art Society offers perhaps the most
unexpected show of the season: 'Gibson to Gilbert: British Sculpture
1840-1914' (until July 2). The core of this group of 65 works is the
outstanding collection put together by John Lewis, and previously on
extended loan to the Minneapolis Institute of Arts. Its particular strength
is the New Sculpture that revolutionised British sculpture in the last two
decades of the 19th century, an area of collecting in which the gallery
first became involved in 1902. The New sculptors promoted sculpture for the
home - hence the profusion here of reduced-size casts of domestic scale but
museum quality.
The genius here is Sir Alfred Gilbert of Eros fame. He not only revived the
infinitely subtle 'lost-wax' bronze-casting technique and developed a taste
for combining metals, ivory and semi-precious stones, but invested his
sculpture with a powerful personal symbolism. The exhibition, with its
excellent catalogue by Benedict Read, also includes works by Bayes, Boehm,
Frampton and Hamo Thornycroft, as well as the painter-sculptors Lord
Leighton, GF Watts and Alfred Stevens. Here, too, are Dalou, who taught in
London, and Carpeaux who exhibited here. Prices range from Pounds
2,200-Pounds 110,000.
Italian and German 16th and 17th century bronzes plus Old Master drawings
after Antique and Renaissance sculpture, and preparatory sketches for
sculpture, are among the various works of art in the combined show of
Trinity Fine Art and Katrin Bellinger, at Harari and Johns Ltd (June 24-July
10). We find, say, Girolamo da Carpi drawing from various Roman sources, and
sheets after Michelangelo by Battista Franco, Salviati and Tintoretto. An
unusual Paulus van Vianen is a design for a lost silver plaquette.
WR Harvey's seventh summer exhibition (until June 27) focuses on the
furniture of the period of the four Georges, organised into four room sets.
The show is worth visiting not least to see the loans which include a
spectacular pair of gilt Palladian armchairs made to the designs of William
Kent by Benjamin Goodison in 1730, rich in classical detail and metaphor.
Oriental porcelain dealers S. Marchant &amp; Son is also staging its seventh
summer show (June 7-26). It is, the firm believes, the first commercial show
devoted to Qing mark and period monochrome and two-coloured wares. The 60 or
so exhibits, predominantly 18th century, have been gathered mostly from
private collections over several years. Within the show's self-imposed
parameters (there is understandably no blue and white, say), the quality and
range in terms of ware and form are impressive.
Monochrome porcelains are for the purist, for their success depends entirely
on form and colour - and the glazes are glorious. Such a spectrum of colour
had not been seen before in ceramic art. Here we find pale lavender,
celadon, peachbloom, red, brilliant yellow and lemon, purple, aubergine,
blue, green, turquoise and brown. Prices range from Pounds 1,600-Pounds
70,000. The handsome hardback catalogue (Pounds 30 inc p&amp;p), with an
introduction by John Ayers, should prove a useful reference work.
Spink's present another first: an exhibition of the much derided Satsuma
pottery of 19th century Japan (until June 19). Its 50 choice pieces have
been selected to prove that there is a difference of chalk and cheese
between the mass-produced - and still much in evidence - Satsuma export
wares and the spectacular show pieces - often intended for World Fairs -
produced by specialised workshops and studios in Kyoto and Osaka. The show
presents the work of the greatest Satsuma potters and artists, including
five pieces by the unrivalled Sozan. Prices are Pounds 1,500-Pounds 38,000.
Barling of Mount Street launch the first in a series of annual exhibitions
designed to show a representative example of what the firm normally carries
in stock (June 9-26). On show is a set of three 16th century Japanese fusuma
or sliding door panels now mounted as screens, 17th century Chinese lacquer
trays and boxes, Sui and Yuan dynasty sculpture and a group of 16th and 17th
century Chinese hardwood furniture. The cataloque is prefaced with an
impassioned plea for the sympathetic conservation of such furniture, the
original surfaces of which have been so often destroyed by abrasives and
chemical solvents during careless restoration. Prices, Pounds 2,500-Pounds
75,000.
Linda Wrigglesworth is host of Sue Olleman's exhibition of 19th century gold
and moghul jewellery from the Indian subcontinent (June 18-27). Jehanne de
Biolley shows a service of mostly 19th century apple green Peking glass
(June 9-26).
Surprisingly colourful quilts made in the Amish communities of Ohio, Indiana
and Pennsylvania in 1900-1950 - the forms and colour combinations of which
were to prove so influential to the early American Abstract painters in the
1950s - are to be found at Browse &amp; Darby until June 20. Prices Pounds
3,500-Pounds 7,500.
Wildenstein presents a fascinating exhibition of the Russian artist Marevna
and her friends in Montparnasse 1912-42 (June 17-September 16). The show
marks the centenary of her birth, and is organised in association with the
Musee du Petit Palais, Geneva. First a Cubist, exhibiting at the Salon des
Independents in 1913, she moved on to Pointillism before curiously combining
the two styles.
Inevitably, however, much of the show's interest rests on Marevna as a
chronicler of Bohemian society. Many of her pictures and drawings portrays
her friends, Diego Rivera (the father of her child), Picasso, Chagall,
Leger, Modigliani, Soutine and Gorky among them. On show are some 30
Marevnas plus the work of some 20 friends, including Blanchard, van Dongen,
Foujita, Laurencin and Soutine.
More Russian pictures can be found in the Roy Miles summer show (until July
9). Jonathan Clark's Modern show (until June 27) is particularly strong on
the Scottish Colourists, with works by Cadell, Cursiter and Peploe. Many of
the British artists exhibited there also take a bow at Spink's 20th century
show (until June 26). Here we also find a Vorticist watercolour by Wyndham
Lewis and a recently discovered Duncan Grant portrait of Vanessa Bell.
Prices: Pounds 1,000-Pounds 100,000.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Collecting: High hopes for a fruitful fair - London's
dealers and auctioneers are putting on their bravest faces for the new
London Season. And, as Antony Thorncroft reports, they are hoping that the
big buyers will be flocking back . . .

THIS IS the month in which the hearts of London's antique dealers and
auctioneers beat that little bit faster. June: the start of the London
Season, the time when the world's richest traditionally flock to the capital
and spend, spend, spend. Now the trade lays on the grandest fairs, holds the
most enticing auctions, offers in the galleries the choicest stock.
Or that, at least, is the theory. The practice in the last two years has
been less happy. Rich American dealers and collectors, in particular, have
become rare birds of passage and the slump in the antiques market has
deterred sellers from offering treasures at auction and impaired the ability
of dealers to invest in fine new stock.
Yet this June there are signs of renewed confidence. Forget about the Lloyds
Names forced to sell off antiques to pay their debts; ignore the stagnation
in the property market which has badly hit demand for home furnishings. The
stock market is booming and trade has picked up slightly in the last two
months. Prices at auction are rising, albeit from much reduced levels, and
some Americans have been spotted in London's Mayfair.
The antiques trade desperately needs a good June. For most dealers it is the
busiest month of their year, and with rising bank debts they badly need to
sell well. This could be make or break month for many dealers.
Those at the top of the heap have been competing, as usual, to get into the
Grosvenor House Fair, in London's Park Lane, which signifies the start of
the Season and is the pinnacle of the British antiques year. Even if the
ultra-rich visitors fail to buy at the opening gala, at least they make
contact and remember the names on the stands. Purchases may arrive a year or
more later.
This year the theme is '1492-1992: 500 Years of American patronage', and one
or two American dealers, notably Newhouse and Peter Tillou, have been
allowed to join the 80 or so big names of the British trade. In price terms
there is nothing to compare with the Dollars 20m-plus Turner that Agnew's
offered last year - indeed, prices across the board will show no increase on
a year ago - but there are thousands of carefully vetted treasures on offer.
Tillou is displaying one of the most expensive, a portrait of Andrew Jackson
Ten Broeck as a baby by the famed American itinerant folk artist Ammi
Phillips. Its price is undisclosed but will be in seven (dollar) figures.
Many dealers will be offering works of art with an American theme. Nicholas
Harris, a new exhibitor, has the silver vase presented in 1905 to the
founder of the Camp Fire Club of America. David Messum has a display of
Anglo-American Impressionist paintings by the likes of Singer Sargent and
Merritt Chase. The O'Shea Gallery has a pair of lithographs depicting the
yachts 'America' and 'Alarm' which competed against each other in 1851.
All the big names - Agnew's, Norman Adams, Spink, Garrard, Apter-Fredericks,
Colnaghi, Ronald A. Lee, Asprey, Richard Green, etc - are at the fair and
many will be showing works held back for the event. Grosvenor House has a
luxurious image but items can be bought for less than Pounds 1,000 and, as a
spectacle it is unsurpassed.
Many more dealers are piling into the Fine Art and Antiques Fair at Olympia,
which continues until June 14. There will be approaching 400 dealers taking
part, making this the largest Olympia yet. Many will be sharing stands, so
keen are they to get the chance to offer stock to the expected 40,000
visitors.
The fair is on two levels, with the downstairs Silver Section containing the
fairly cheap and slightly cheerful end of the trade, while upstairs the Gold
Section features the specialist, upmarket dealers, selling more expensive
antiques. However, there are dealers who prefer to relegate themselves to
the ground floor because they feel, with some justification, that many
prospective punters, exhausted after browsing through over 200 'Silver'
stands, never have the energy to venture up the staircase.
Although every item is vetted for authenticity Olympia is a much more
relaxed event than grand and exclusive Grosvenor House, with which it
overlaps. There is a dazzling array of goods on offer, ranging from a pair
of mahogany library chairs with Egyptian motifs, probably made by Gillow
around 1805 (C. Fredericks); to a 1694 silver salt (Brian Beet); a rare full
length portrait of Mary Tudor (Richard Philip); a Cartier diamond flower
brooch of 1890 (Moira of Bond Street); a pre-Columbian feather head-dress
from Peru (Esther Fitzgerald); a Chinese export tankard of 1775 decorated
with Masonic symbols (Earle D. Vandekar); a range of art deco from new
exhibitor Rupert Cavendish; the Entrance Gates to Les Halles meat market,
built in Paris in the 1850s (Nellie Lenson and Roy Smith); a James I gold
pound used decades later by James II as the first recorded military medal
for Edward Clavering (Baldwins, the coin dealers, another first time
exhibitor).
And so it goes on . . .
The attraction of Olympia is that if you are interested in acquiring a
breakfront bookcase, or a Georgian silver tea pot, or a Derby porcelain
dinner service, or an oil painting depicting kittens, there will be dozens -
if not scores - of examples on offer at the fair.
Olympia is used by the comfortably-off to decorate their homes. Each June
they come with, say, Pounds 2,000 which they are determined to spend. One
year they will be looking for an oval table and chairs, the next year for a
long case clock, the next for an oriental rug. They know that as well as the
widest choice in chaotic accessibility the fair offers respectable dealers
who will often accept 10 per cent below the quoted price from a keen buyer.
Dealers try and hold on to good stock to unveil at the fair. This year, if
the hoped-for revival in buying fails to materialise, some could be offering
attractive discounts rather than face the prospect of carrying the goods for
many months.
Unfortunately, this being the UK, where the middle classes prefer to spend
their disposable wealth on educating their children rather than acquiring
antiques, there will never be enough native British buyers to keep the
dealers in champagne. Fortunately, the fair also attracts foreign,
particularly European, dealers and private collectors who, with luck, will
become loyal clients - and it also offers the exhibitors the chance to pick
over the best pieces from competitors' stands before the public is allowed
in.
But this is not goodbye to the fairs. There are two specialist jamborees
about to open, the International Ceramics fair at the Park Lane Hotel,
starting on June 12, and the London Antiquarian Book Fair, at the same
venue, from June 23. Both are shorter, more intensive, and appeal mainly to
enthusiasts.
Ceramics have been largely overlooked by the boom and bust that has affected
other sectors of the art market. Prices do nor change much over the years,
which is good for serious collectors. The exception has been the finest
pieces of Chinese porcelain which are fought over by Hong Kong, Taiwanese
and Singaporean buyers.
At this year's fair there are sure to be many pieces from the Vung Tau
cargo, the 17th century Chinese ship which sank off Vietnam with its
porcelain, originally destined for Amsterdam, and which re-surfaced at a
Christie's sale this spring. Helen Buxton and Heirloom and Howard will
certainly be offering items, priced as low as Pounds 50 for a blue and white
tea bowl, while AntiqueWest has a cabinet devoted to 'Cargo from the Sea'
with items from the Nanking, Gottenburg and Hatcher finds. Ceramics rescued
from the seabed should be bought by specialist collectors rather than
speculative investors: history suggests that they rarely rise in value, at
least not in the short term.
There are more than 40 exhibitors, offering oriental ceramics, continental
porcelain, works from the English factories, glass - the lot. A feature of
the fair, which this year is being copied by Olympia, is the series of
lectures by international experts on such subjects as 'Creamware: its
origins and development' and 'The Importance of Limehouse', a look at the
Limehouse factory, which only lasted from 1745-48. This is the kind of thing
that the ceramics buffs, who flock to the fair from all over the world,
love.
Top quality antiquarian books have held their price well in recent years,
and is a supremely international market. Over 100 booksellers have taken
space at Park Lane to offer 30,000 books for sale, ranging from a rare first
edition of The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes, priced at Pounds 3,500, to a
first edition of Keats' Poems (Pounds 13,500), to a first edition of Adam
Smith's Wealth of Nations at Pounds 20,000. But many books will sell for
under Pounds 100.
The auction houses are quieter this month than in the past (the
Impressionist sales are very lacklustre), although Sotheby's has a genuine
Rembrandt to sell and Christie's a Richard Dadd fairy painting. But even the
dealers concentrating at the fairs will have wonderful back-up displays in
their galleries and there are still dealers who hold aloof from fairs and
prefer to tempt customers with their splashy June exhibitions.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Private View: Artemis at the Olympic hunt - Christian Tyler
meets Alison Williamson, an archer aiming for the ultimate sporting glory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE farrier's daughter on Wenlock Edge the road to the Olympic Games was
no longer than her father's driveway: 30 yards, to be exact.
Here, on the steep path to a modern bungalow high in the Shropshire hills,
Alison Williamson has for 14 years practised shooting arrows.
She took up archery quite simply because it was happening all around her. 'I
was in the pram watching mum and dad shoot,' she said this week after her
selection for the British women's team for Barcelona.
Her father Tom (once good enough for the national squad) and mother Sue had
started shooting before her birth. When she reached the age of six 'it was
either fight with little sister in the car or get out and do it yourself. So
I stopped beating up my little sister and decided to shoot.'
Today's weapons bear little resemblance to the longbows of Sherwood Forest
or Agincourt. They are made of fibreglass rather than yew and are adorned
with stabilisers, sights, 'clickers' and pressure buttons. Modern archery is
an exercise in rhythmic repetition under mental discipline, less akin to
rifle-shooting than to golf or dry-fly fishing.
Some devotees rhapsodise about the whisper of the arrow as the bowstring is
drawn, the moment before loosing when the earth stands still, the awful
silence as the arrow hurtles away and the cathartic thump as it buries its
nose in the target.
Britain's blonde Artemis doesn't talk like that. To her, archery is second
nature. Nor, as she points out, do champions have to be sensitive and
intelligent. Some of them are as thick as two short planks.
Age and physique make little difference. Alison is a tall, leggy creature,
lively and restless. As she talked she gesticulated with her long fingers
and squirmed in her chair. But behind the squeals and giggles there is,
according to both her father and her team manager, a very determined and
competitive person.
I asked her whether she developed personal rivalries.
'I don't. I compete against myself. I don't even go for scoring more, I just
go for technique. Of course I have a little score in my mind that I would
like to get, but it's not the be-all and end-all.'
She gave as an example how she had learned to stop being an 'amber gambler'.
Competition archers are given 2 1/2 minutes, monitored by traffic lights, to
shoot each set of three arrows. 'Amber gamblers', lacking confidence, impose
an extra deadline by waiting for the yellow light before making their shots.
I asked Alison what she thought about on the line.
'If I have to wait I count the clouds, count the planes, look at the trees.
I'm marshmallow-head. But when it's three arrows in 2 1/2 minutes I'm
normally off the line in 40 seconds.'
Men shoot differently from women, she said.
'Men tend to be always fiddling with their equipment. They cannot leave the
technical side alone. Whereas women tend to say 'Let's get on the line and
shoot . . . leave hubby to do that or whatever.' I mean my dad, he's just a
typical man, just always playing with his equipment. 'Or there's the people
who are very keen and want to know too much. I think it's probably best to
be ignorant. They always ask 'why, why?''
Is it that women are more pragmatic, or phlegmatic?
'It doesn't really interest them. I don't care how the inside of my plunger
button (a device to correct the arrow's curved ejection path) works, whereas
I know men will take it apart just to look how it works. I just pick up the
bow and I shoot it.'
Archery is presently dominated by the Koreans, for whom it is a national
sport. (Americans also rank high; the British men managed a team bronze in
1988). In a 144-arrow competition worth ten points an arrow, the Koreans
regularly score around 1350. Alison's best score was 1301 and these days she
averages 1280-90.
Why are the Koreans so good?
'They live, sleep, eat archery. I mean they spend two hours in a field just
doing visualisation. And that's all they do. They have this approach, and it
works. We're sure they're hypnotised.'
She recalled being followed round the practice ground at last year's world
championships in Poland by the women's Olympic champion Kim Soo-Nyung.
'She was shooting absolutely awfully. I kept going back to the rest of my
team and saying 'She's putting in blues (outers) at 60 metres] This is
weird. I'm shooting tight and she's shooting everywhere]'
'They said 'Just wait till tomorrow.' And then the next day they all sort of
march onto the shooting field and they're all . . . blanked (she waved her
hand over her face) . . . sort of little robots. I'm sure they're
programmed.'
How do you think it's done?
'I went to this lecture in Italy by the former Korean coach. They watch
videos of candles, the flames. They have to concentrate on one point of the
flame. Or they have, like, kaleidoscopes and they have to pick one point and
focus on that. And that's what it is. They're taught how to concentrate.
It's drilled into them. They do it every night.'
So is it better for an archer to be a zombie? 'That's what's said: it helps
to be stupid. I don't know.
'To shoot those type of scores I think you have to be a robot. But you
slightly go into robot anyway. My friend in Arizona noticed when I go on the
line I look like I was on a different planet, sort of thing. Whereas they're
switched off all the time]'
The story is told to squeals of laughter.
Alison is one year into a five-year archery scholarship at Arizona State
University, at Tempe near Phoenix, where American toxophilites are nurtured.
She is studying social work. I asked her if she was good academically.
She laughed. 'I keep on the honours roll so I can't be that bad.'
Are you thinking about the Olympics a lot?
'Not particularly.'
Is that because you've been trained not to think about them?
'No. I mean, it's been my goal since I started. So if I hadn't made the team
I would have been just . .' She gestured wildly.
Devastated?
'Devastated'.
Are you nervous?
'Before the trials I was slightly. I had trained a lot and I knew I could do
it. But the night before I had this awful dream: you know, everything that
can go wrong did go wrong. I woke up . . . ahhhhh] It's not true]'
What went wrong?
'I turn up to the to the ground and no-one is there that should be. Then I
get on the line and the nocks are too big for the string and every time I
put an arrow on it falls off, and every arrow you look at, someone's gouged
it out.' She shrieked. 'I can't even get round to shooting]'
What does it mean to get to the Olympics?
Alison laughed at my foolish question. 'It's the Olympics] The whole
sporting world is there]'
Sometimes she imagines herself shooting against the Olympic champion in the
head-to-head final elimination round that is being introduced this year (it
is thought to be more televisual and it may lead to upsets.)
Otherwise she resists the hyper-optimism of her team manager David Clark.
'We play it down a lot. But you know inside that you're going to be in the
top ten or something. I don't go around saying I'm going to get a medal.
It's stupid to say that.'
Do you want to win a medal?
'It would be nice.'
I mean, I said, are you desperate to win a medal?
'Well, just as long as I do well. If I get a medal it's like a bonus -
because I know the competition.'
Do others think you might?
Artemis shrieked with laughter. 'I don't know. There might be a slim
chance.'

FT  06 JUN 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Lost in gloom again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAD NO time to go to the Derby this week, for I was too busy processing
the great chunks of news bombarding us from all directions, like rogue
asteroids. Ross Perot. The Earth summit in Rio. Those giggling Danes, who
probably shouldn't be in the European Community anyway but whose frivolous
vote against closer European unity is being allowed to impede the sacred
cause of Euro-federalism. In my view the Danes should be booted out, and
only readmitted on payment of a fine equivalent to Dollars 100,000-per-Dane.
With all this big stuff going on, you needed to be a connoisseur of inside
news-pages to spot Tuesday's reports from Columbus, Ohio, of a development
that many of us have been waiting 30 or 40 years for - a long-life light
bulb.
It is called the E-lamp, and has been invented by Intersource Technologies,
a California company, which likens the significance of the E-lamp to that of
the CD or fax machine or cellular telephone.
According to The Times: 'The new bulb . . . uses high-frequency radio
signals instead of a filament to produce light more efficiently and more
cheaply; but what makes it special is its lifetime. Instead of the
nine-month life expectancy of an ordinary household bulb, the E-lamp is said
to last about 14 years if used an average of four hours a day.'
At first, I was cheered by news of the E-lamp, for light bulbs devour a
significant fraction of my salary. I own a Notting Hill duplex. The duplex
has six rooms. Those six rooms are lit by 46 light bulbs of one sort or
another. A few last a year or so; most about 12 minutes. So round to the
shop I run, as mad as a twirling dervish, to lay-in another stock of
unreliable light-bulbs. They are the bane of my life.
'The bulb will initially cost several pounds,' said the news-story, 'but it
uses only a quarter of the electricity of a traditional bulb and prices are
expected to come down soon after it reaches the market early next year.'
If at first I was euphoric, I was soon lost in gloom again, for I have spent
most of a lifetime waiting for a 14-year light bulb and have long been
convinced that the manufacturers' failure to produce one was the result of
industrial conspiracy and incompetence. In short, I won't believe in the
reality of 14-year light bulbs until all 46 light fittings in my flat are
ablaze with them.
Increasingly, I am losing my faith in the future. I used to read a lot of
futurology. The future seemed a nice place to be. I spent most of my time
there. But the older I get, the more I realise that the future only arrives
in absurd fits and starts. We get pieces of it here, bits of it there. And
they still haven't cured the common cold.
Much of the trouble has to do with technological extrapolation. As
scientists acknowledge, short-range forecasts tend to be over-optimistic.
One of the results of this is that simple folk like me can easily be fooled
into believing that the future will be uniformly and unquestionably better
than the present; that the pace of scientific and economic advance will be
constant and dramatic; that instead of taking one step forward and
two-and-a-half steps back, mankind is advancing on all possible fronts. But
it's not.
Take transportation. In his book about the future, July 20 2019: Life In The
21st Century, Arthur C Clarke, the famous science fiction writer, paints a
fluorescently optimistic and one-sided picture of transportation in 2019.
Maglevs (magnetically levitated railroads). Supersonic aircraft carrying 600
passengers. Hypersonic aircraft. Journeys to the stars.
He should try visiting London. We are now closer to 2019 than to 1964, but
does anyone think we're making progress? What we seem to be getting is
niftier hardware but worse and slower transport.
If you have been reading a fraction of the material coming out of Rio, you
will have realised that we have lost control of the planet. Bio-diversity
and pollution control? Don't make me laugh. We have turned the planet into a
sewer, just as the SF writers predicted we would.
But do not feel downcast. Before too long we will be jetting to the stars.
We will find new worlds to populate with creatures. Life will be good. There
will be no acid rain. We will not cut down the forests. Back on Earth -
Planet Sewer - our descendants will read about these worlds, and wonder, and
weep. I hope their light bulbs last longer than mine.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SOUTH African blacks distrust the police, the judiciary, the army
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
everything to do with the white state. The story of Anna Maleka makes it
easy to see why.
Eighteen months ago, she was shot and stabbed in an attack on a Soweto-bound
commuter train in which 26 people died. Two of her friends were slaughtered
in the incident: middle-aged, God-fearing ladies who had joined her in
singing gospel songs to pass the time on the tedious 30 km journey.
Maleka wants revenge, less for her suffering than for theirs. So, she has
decided to testify against her attackers - risking retribution from them
and, more importantly, from members of their family who remain at liberty.
She suspects that the assailants were members of Inkatha, the mainly Zulu
political party which has been involved in much recent township violence.
And she is firmly convinced - like most township residents - that Inkatha
has close links with the South African security forces; she fears her
attackers could use police channels to discover her address. None the less,
she is willing to risk her life to see justice done.
Unfortunately, the police and the prosecutor do not appear equally keen. Not
that they obstruct justice actively; but when it comes to blacks murdering
one another, they seem to find their motivation somewhat diminished.
True, such cases are notoriously difficult to prosecute, precisely because
witnesses are reluctant to come forward. But while the authorities know that
jungle justice applies in South African townships, where the life of anyone
who testifies against a criminal is worth little, they do surprisingly
little to counter this threat. Chasing the killer of a white farmer or
housewife is a high priority affair, but black-on-black violence commands
much less attention.
So, 18 months after the event, the prosecutor - Advocate HJ Broodryk, of the
Attorney General's office - says there is too little evidence to mount a
trial. He seems untroubled that so little headway has been made towards
punishing those responsible for one of the most gruesome incidents in the
recent spate of violence - despite a pledge from President de Klerk that
such cases will be investigated and prosecuted with vigour.
Maleka could tell him why the case is so weak: police have led witnesses to
believe that their identity cannot be concealed in a trial. They have called
victims to two identity parades to pinpoint their attackers, using one-way
glass to protect them. But they have said that one-way glass is only a
temporary shield: eventually, witnesses must identify their attackers in
open court and risk vengeance from family members sitting in the public
gallery.
Indeed, the policemen who organised the latest identity parade were so
cavalier about witness protection that they ushered Maleka through the wrong
door after the identification - straight into the presence of the accused.
After that incident, her fellow witnesses vowed to attend no further parades
and made clear they had no intention of appearing in open court.
Under South African law, witnesses can claim more protection than this.
Evidence can be heard in camera, and their identity disguised by other
means. But the prosecutor must apply for such protection on their behalf;
and when Broodryk was approached on the issue, his immediate response was
that if witnesses did not wish to testify, the state would compel them to do
so.
He threatened to jail Maleka if she was too terrified to appear in open
court; and although he relented and said he would consider requesting that
evidence be heard in camera, he made clear he had little sympathy for her
predicament. The court, he said, might well not accept her reasons for
demanding anonymity - assuming he decided to plead her case in the first
place.
He attempted to reassure me - Maleka works for a journalists' co-operative,
of which the Financial Times is a member - that the case would never come to
trial, so there was no cause for concern. Yet, prosecuting cases such as
this, actively and aggressively, must be the only way to stop future
incidents. Certainly, such trials are difficult to win; but the police and
the prosecutors have a remedy at hand - if only they could be bothered to
use it.

FT  06 JUN 92 / The terror of the amateur: Dominic Lawson is taught a
frightening lesson by fast bowler Courtney Walsh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE elegant American journalist George Plimpton, writing about sport was
not enough. He also had a passion for experiencing it - at the highest
level. Then he would describe the dreadful consequences, as professional
bone crunched into amateur flesh. Thus, he went a round with Archie Moore,
the former World light heavyweight boxing champion, and described in his
book Shadow Box the unpleasant sensation of having his nose squished by a
right he never saw being thrown. And that was Archie being gentle.
On another occasion Plimpton trained for, and then took part in, a game of
professional American football. A film was made about it. My abiding memory
is of seeing the gangly figure of Plimpton miraculously catching the ball,
but then crashing with it into his own goalpost. How the crowd laughed] I
laughed, too.
I would not be so cruel again, I have unwisely been emulating Plimpton, but,
fortunately, without the television cameras. Somehow I found myself on
Tuesday playing a cricket game at the lovely ground of Downside Abbey
against a mixed Gloucestershire and West Indian XI, captained by the demon
West Indian fast bowler Courtney Walsh, for whose benefit fund the match was
being held. My side, captained by the English rugby international Simon
Halliday, also seemed, with one exception, to be of consistently formidable
quality, with a sprinkling of former Somerset stars such as Peter Denning,
Peter Roebuck and Vic Marks.
Early on in the game I made my mark. Vic Marks (England and Somerset) was
bowling. Jimmy Adams (Jamaica and West Indies) was facing. He was their star
batsman. Marks observed me standing at orthodox mid-off. 'I think at this
stage it would be advisable,' he muttered to me, 'if you gave yourself a bit
more space'. Dutifully I trotted back 20 yards. Marks tossed the ball up,
Adams lofted his off-drive. The ball spiralled towards me. It couldn't miss.
But I could. The ball sailed through my hands and landed tamely at my feet.
How the crowd laughed]
Later Walsh himself came to the crease. Someone in the crowd explained 'Of
course, Walsh is not a batsman.' Courtney must have heard. He sent the next
two balls from marks high, straight and true into the pavilion. At this
point, farce took over. 'Let Dominic have a bowl at Walshie,' said Denning.
Captain Halliday threw me the ball. The first over Walsh treated me with
preposterous respect. The next over he launched himself at the ball . . .
and was caught. This, I felt, was a big mistake on my part.
And so it turned out. As I went in to bat at the end of the game, a
unanimous choice as No 11, Courtney grabbed the ball. I had no helmet. I had
no thigh pad. I had no chance. I recalled the words of the great E W
Swanton, writing last week about Walsh's devastating 7 for 27 against
Yorkshire, which put Walsh top of the first class bowling averages:
'Accuracy and speed comparable to a Scud missile.'
Walsh disappeared in the direction of the pavilion, pacing his run with
slow, almost exaggerated menace. At last he turned and ran in at full speed.
I never saw the ball. I heard it twice. Once as it pitched, and then, a
fraction of a second later, as it thumped into the keeper's gloves. Walsh
repeated this trick three times. Only the third time did it occur to me that
he was deliberately bowling wide of the off stump, to avoid any risk of the
ball actually meeting Lawson. 'Thank you, Courtney,' I said, as I left the
field.
I drew some conclusions from this bowel-churning experience. One is that the
BBC's habit of showing all Test match cricket from the point of view of a
camera 100 yards behind the bowler's arm gives a distorted impression of the
speed of the game: it makes it seem much slower than it is. Indeed it makes
us think we can do better than the England batsmen against the pace men of
the West Indies and Pakistan. Perhaps this is the intention. But facing four
balls from Walsh has made me swear never again to groan impatiently when an
England batsman is caught in the slips groping at an 85 mile an hour
outswinger.
Perhaps this is why George Plimpton insisted on experiencing first class
sport before writing about it. Not until you find out just how bad you are,
do you discover just how good they are.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Arts: June rhymes with loon - Video
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Distributor of the Month award goes to Columbia Tristar Video. With a
blazing nerve that other companies should imitate, they are expanding their
catalogue of widescreen videos. June 8 sees the release of Sir David Lean's
Lawrence Of Arabia in its newly restored director's cut, Kenneth Branagh's
Henry V and Spielberg's Close Encounters Of The Third Kind - The Special
Edition.
When first issued on video, the above films were all cropped to fit a TV
format and, sadly, to suit the thousands of viewers who still complain when
widescreen films are shown compositionally intact on the small screen. These
viewers get dyspeptic about the necessary 'letter-boxing' effect that
requires black strips of empty screen to appear at the top and bottom.
Unfortunately, the only other way to fit a complete widescreen image onto a
square frame would be to squeeze the image as they used to do on film nights
at my prep school. There - how I remember - a star like Charles Laughton,
appearing in a concertina'd CinemaScope movie, would resemble a beanpole and
a star like James Stewart would vanish completely when he turned sideways.
Until widescreen television sets themselves reach the shops - they are
promised but not for some years - initiatives like Columbia Tristar's are
beyond price. They remind us that good films do not consist of an aimless
yardage of story information that can be pictorially cut and slashed to suit
the delivery system of the moment. If a good director is behind the lens,
every image tells a story and half an image tells half a story. Later
widescreen releases this year from Columbia will include The Last Emperor,
Gandhi, The Bear, Oliver] and Glory.
Elsewhere on the video scene June rhymes with loon. The season is full of
amiably insane comedies arriving from America. The Addams Family (Columbia
Tristar) is the moneyspinning film of the TV series of the Charles Addams
cartoons: Anjelica Huston and Raul Julia bestriding a script stuffed with
bats and corpses and one or two good jokes. In Bill And Ted's Bogus Journey
(20: 20 Vision) Death himself appears: a blanched-faced chess player with a
Swedish accent who challenges our airhead heroes (Keanu Reeves, Alex Winter)
to the usual sudden-mortality play-offs.
And then there is the best film of the three, What About Bob (Buena Vista).
Here Bill Murray is a New York mental patient pursuing analyst Richard
Dreyfuss all the way to RD's holiday home. Dreyfuss hopes to put his feet up
but instead has his hackles raised. Only 'death therapy', he finally
realises, may cure Murray's problems.
How obsessed all these films are with death. Perhaps it is the fin de siecle
factor. June's non-comic offerings also concern themselves with mortality,
from David Mamet's lively, fitful cop thriller Homicide (First Independent),
in which Joe Mantegna copes with anti-semitism and shoot-em-ups in
Baltimore, to the tasty cocktail of death, murder and amnesia in Wolfgang
Petersen's Shattered (Columbia TriStar). No one dies, if I remember
correctly, in Terry Gilliam's The Fisher King (20: 20 Vision). But an
appealing layer of eschatological melancholy lies over this tale of two
down-and-outs (Jeff Bridges and Robin Williams) seeking the Holy Grail in a
fantasy-filled New York.
I you want to take your mind off melancholy things altogether, why not watch
as I did Virgin's The Complete Teach Yourself Juggling Kit, presented by one
Haggis McLeod. By the end of an afternoon spent studying this tape I was
able to keep three wooden spoons airborne for 30 seconds. You may do better,
or worse, but I am sure that like me you will enjoy the learning process. At
least it will get you off the sofa for a few hours while glued to the video
screen.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Arts: Artistic strategies - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE THE future of the earth is debated in Rio, the future of the arts is
debated in five programmes on Radio 3. Sir Richard Luce, former Minister for
the Arts, set up a National Arts and Media Strategy; and after consultation
with the Arts Council, the Regional Arts Boards and such bodies as the BFI,
the Crafts Council and others, a draft paper was published. Each radio
debate covers a particular aspect of the paper, and each has a different
panel. All are chaired by Robert Hewison.
On Monday, the fundamental question: why a strategy at all? It was a
holistic project, and the point, after all the consideration, was what was
to come next. This must not include official preferences, especially as the
paper is not to be re-submitted to the originating Richard Luce but to the
new minister, David Mellor.
Tuesday's debate considered what was in fact to be accepted as 'art'. A long
list progressed from such obvious items as music, dance, drama, and so on,
by way of folk-arts, to television and video. Experimental and innovative
work had to be included, and the standing of work aimed at specific targets
like blacks, gays and the disabled. Such matters as directing the arts
'industry', providing funds and setting standards did not seem quite
relevant to the debate's theme.
They came up on Wednesday, where the theme was the relationship between
artist and institution, and the feeling more practical. The topic was
largely money, its inadequacy generally realised; but other interesting
points were raised. The 'right to fail' was played down in favour of the
duty to create; and the paper's distinction between primary and
interpretative artists was dismissed. There are two more debates next week.
On Sunday, Radio 3 repeated the 1988 production of John Guare's play Women
and Water, set mostly on the battlefield of Cold Harbour, Virginia, in 1864,
but switching from place to place and from time to time in the author's own
adaptation. At the heart of it is Lydie Breeze (Natasha Richardson), a nurse
in the Union Army. As she goes in a riverboat to buy medical supplies from
the depot, we move to a tale about about Lydie's father, captain of a
Nantucket whaler. All the black crew are lost, and later the ship itself,
complete with the captain's log.
We soon return to the fighting, then back to Nantucket; it would take half a
page to detail the sundry intertwined stories. It was all pretty exciting,
but whether it is good drama is another thing. My feeling is that if
Treasure Island is a good novel, then this is a good play, though I believe
it would have been even better for radio as a serial. It was enjoyably
played, in serviceable American voices, under Stuart Owen's direction.
Radio 4's own 'Classic Serial' on Saturday made a disappointing start. Colin
Haydn Evans's Castle of the Star is a two-part tale about TE Lawrence, which
promises us new light on his character and motivation in the Arabian
campaign. I observed no new light in the first half, only new inventions of
conversations with General Allenby and Henley of the FO; but this half ended
just as Lawrence was captured at Deraa, where Rattigan, for example, gave
him some unusual experiences. We may know more this evening about the
association of Lawrence (Simon Chandler) with his Arab bodyguard, Salim
Ahmed. Nigel Bryant directed.
Usually it is Radio 1 to blend social problems with popular music but this
week was Radio 2's turn. People need people, a national strategy for the
requirement, and the opportunities, for volunteers was introduced on Monday
by Ken Bruce, and continued through the week by him and others with helpful
information.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Arts: Sombre drama in Berlin - Psycho-surrealism dominated
this year's festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUTH BERGHAUS and Luc Bondy are in, Peter Stein and Robert Wilson are out.
In competitive Germany, the big annual theatre festival, Berlin's
Theatertreffen, is a dog-eats-dog affair in which directors across Germany,
Austria and Switzerland juggle for the dozen invitation-only places each
May. It makes for two weeks of outstanding theatre, and for something more.
If art mirrors life, anyone interested in Germany's self-image should glance
at this Festival, which as a cultural statement goes beyond a choice of
plays.
Last year, the Festival mixed upbeat, offbeat, funny, classical works, and
only four of them by Germans. This year, Germany is in sombre and
introspective mood. Nine of the 12 offerings are by German authors, and the
remaining three - Babel, Beckett and Strindberg - are stubbornly
mid-European in spirit. And, with exceptions, the dominant style for 1992 is
psycho-surreal, emphasising the inward, the subjective, drama as a
self-contained work of art. Berlin this last festival fortnight is like a
theatre museum which 'makes one little room an everywhere', exhibiting
finely chiselled, intense pieces in perfect yet other-worldly stagings.
Most controversial guest is Ruth Berghaus, who since her days at the
Berliner Ensemble in the 1970s has stamped her definitive style on opera and
theatre productions across Europe. Does the clever choreography and
mechanised showmanship of a production like Brecht's Jungle of Cities draw
out or destroy the heart of a piece?
Jungle of Cities, about the inexplicable struggle between two men, is
unusual Brecht: full of dark undercurrents and understated emotions, not
overtly political, it is a quintessential German Expressionist piece which
seems to cry out for the surreal Berghaus touch. Here lumber dealer Schlink
(Sven-Eric Bechtoff) and poor young Garga (Martin Wuttke) stiffen into
robots, splurting out the play in a rapid cold monotone.
In Erich Wonder's set, Brecht's Chicago is a mechanised urban jigsaw,
criss-crossed with railway lines to form diagonal rooms, backed by
silhouettes of skyscrapers, flooded with light through a veil of gauze.
People enter through windows, fall into holes in the ground; leaflets tip
down like rain. In this climate, homo-erotic impulses turn to hate:
threatened by closeness, Garga and Schlink - the fantasist versus the wan
messenger of death - lock into a deadly, lonely fight. An orange builder's
tent moves slowly, menacingly across the stage towards Garga: man against
society, the city devouring its own.
Skimping on plot, character, the rhythm of Brecht's language, Berghaus draws
a cityscape as vivid yet distorted as an Expressionist painting. At times
her minimalism suffocates, but she gets to the essence of the play -
isolation in the modern city, its unreality, its removal from earthly values
 -through symbols at once meaningful now and evocative of the 1920s city of
the Untouchables.
At the tiny Ballhaus Rixdorf, the tale of Bluebeard, the monster who
murdered his young wives if they glanced into forbidden rooms in his castle,
is played in Georg Trakl's 1911 dramatisation as a showpiece of Viennese
expressionism. With painted gold-black panels suggesting Klimt, music by
Mahler and Zemlinsky, the staging oozes sexual symbolism at every pore.
Dance, mime, music underline a fragmentary setting; parts of bodies flit
across vertical and horizontal slices of the stage, boxes of light jut out
at odd angles leaving the rest of the theatre black, a leg slides through a
slit in a curtain, a head peers above a trapdoor and is yanked back.
All are images from the nightmare/dream world of young Herbert (Thomas
Clemens), for whom Bluebeard's three doomed wives are icons of passive
sexuality. In white frills, bobbed curls, a red rose at their breasts, Inga
Hartl, Mia Hasper and Felicitas Kielingerer play them as life-size puppets.
Mechanically, they dance faster and faster until they break; keeling over,
one hangs dead by the ankles from a bare tree in winter. Only when Herbert,
confronted by his father's Catholic morality, stops dreaming, does the stage
open up to reveal deeper perspectives as panel after panel of drug-induced
fantasy - Trakl died of a cocaine overdose at 27 - is removed.
Saint/sinners, virgin/harlots, the torture chamber and an Eden glimpsed
through a window: director Cesare Lievi plays the forbidden rooms of
Herbert's unconscious against the forbidden rooms of the cloistered wives in
Perrault's story. This Vienna Burgtheater production distils classic
ingredients of pre-war Viennese art - the erotic dream, the passing of old
order into new, father versus son - into a 60-minute miniature as magically
condensed as the original fairy tale.
At the other extreme of self-reflective theatre, Luc Bondy directs Botho
Strauss's Final Chorus (Schlusschor) as a symbolical play about German
reunification. The German love-affair with this piece continues to baffle
this foreigner, but the production is slick and superbly acted.
Bondy, with a post-modern set of long mirrors encased in steel lift shafts,
works through the dilemmas of Ossis and Wessies in satire at the expense of
15 agonisedly self-conscious heeled liberals who rush in and out to trim up
their intellectual and social images before the looking glass. As the mirror
reflects the audience too, we are implicated; we are also entertained by a
mix of slapstick, philosophy, melodrama and a large flapping eagle
symbolising united Germany. It is vintage politics-and-pastiche Strauss; not
for those in search of the old well-made play, but a compelling new exhibit
for cultural tourists.
Jungle of Cities continues in at Hamburg's Thalia Theatre; Bluebeard at the
Vienna Burgtheater; and Final Chorus at the Schaubuhne, Berlin.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Arts: A 'Wozzeck' awaited with bated breath / Review of the
first Barenboim/Chereau collaboration at the Chatelet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BASTILLE'S loss is the Chatelet's gain. Three years ago, Daniel
Barenboim was forcibly removed from the administration of the new Paris
opera house, and a whole first set of opera-programming went with him - but
not all of it was entirely lost. The planned Boulez-Stein Pelleas was taken
up instead by the Welsh National Opera, and in due course brought by them to
the Chatelet, Jacques Chirac's Paris opera bastion, from where noses can be
neatly thumbed at Mitterand's Bastille down-river.
By a similar arrangement - in this case, a Chatelet co-production with the
Berlin Staatsoper and Chicago - the theatre has acquired probably the
biggest single event of the current Paris season: the Wozzeck that launches
the partnership of Barenboim (conducting his former 'home' orchestra, the
Orchestre de Paris) and the producer Patrice Chereau.
Wednesday's opening was treated to the sort of silent, bated-breath audience
attention - and then the thunderous cheers - the city can sometimes accord
its operatic happenings. On this occasion it was with good reason:
performances on this level of theatrical seriousness and skill are rare on
any opera stage.
Chereau's work in the medium has been intentionally limited to the
epoch-making Bayreuth Ring and Paris Lulu of the 1970s, and a tiny handful
of other outings since; he shows here the rigorous control of style and
texture for which all his theatrical presentations are celebrated. The
three-act opera, played (as is now the rule) without intervals, unfolds as a
severely simple, beautiful piece of continuous opera-theatre. One marvels at
the subtlety of the lighting (by Dominique Brugiere), sometimes daringly
minimal, always precisely focused to the growth of dramatic event, and at
the smooth way Richard Peduzzi's sets - small-town buildings reduced to
vestigial shapes and forms - can be slid across the stage.
Only the fall of the great black curtain marking scene-breaks provides any
starkness, any jagged edge. Nothing too local or too 'anecdotal' - still the
ultimate term of French dispraise - mars the sleek lines of the show. Though
period is touched in by Moidele Bickel's costumes, and a sense of bourgeois
oppression evoked by the enmeshment of Wozzeck and Marie in this
nightmarishly looming-and-dissolving landscape, the great strokes of drama
are boiled down to a kind of Wozzeck essence.
No shaving scene at the start, no medical examination later on: the Doctor
(with a jutting bald head out of German silent cinema) and Captain (with
darting rabbit-runs and skips) are reduced to a catalogue of physical tics.
Here, and indeed in almost all the other key Wozzeck places, something big
and heart-searing about the opera - the angry compassion of its
characterisation, the pained ferocity of its social protest - seems to me to
go missing in the process.
The production opens with the house lights up and the Captain arriving on
stage via a bridge from the auditorium, and closes with the lights up in
similar fashion. The message to the audience is, plainly, 'This is your
life'. For me, though, it remains a statement rather than an emotional
confirmation - and an indication of the extent to which the linked skills of
Chereau's immensely disciplined stagecraft have failed to draw blood, to
stir the emotions beyond distanced connoisseur appreciation.
This may be because of the distanced effect of the music-making. In any
really overwhelming performance of the opera, Berg's music takes possession
of a theatre, fills it to overflowing. Barenboim has exercised enormous care
over the musical preparation - the detailed shaping and dynamic
differentiation of string phrases afford just one among many tokens of
evidence. As before in the opera house, I find his account of the score
lacking in authority, in forwardness of momentum, in 'animal' certainty of
dramatic direction.
Whatever emotional impact the performance does possess is owed to Franz
Grundheber, a Wozzeck admired on stage and record, who concentrates all his
long experience of the opera into Chereau's production without any loss of
his own individuality. He sings the music with wonderful frankness of sound
and manner, shaping words and notes as the idiom were his natural habitat;
he comes across in full, bravely and generously.
Waltraud Meier, a magnificent theatrical animal, throws herself into Marie's
music with thrilling disregard for the safety of her high mezzo; her scenes
with the child are brilliantly staged, yet without allowing the character to
emerge in the round. Graham Clark (a virtuoso Captain), Gunter von Kannen
(Doctor), Mark Baker (Drum Major), Donald Kaasch (Andres) and Birgitta
Svenden (Margret) are all outstanding exponents of Chereau's production.
In repertory until June 15

FT  06 JUN 92 / Arts: Only bucks on Broadway - Karen Fricker queries the
relevance of Tony Awards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FRICKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME OF the best acting in New York was on display at the Gershwin Theatre
last Monday night at the 46th annual Tony Awards ceremony, as the theatre
community preened, patted backs, and pretended that it was still an honour
to win a Tony.
Tony nominees Roscoe Lee Browne (for for best supporting actor in August
Wilson's Two Trains Running) and Judd Hirsch (who won the best actor award
for his performance in Herb Gardner's Conversations with my Father)
inadvertently put the Tonys into perspective when, on a television chat show
several days before the ceremony, they were unable to name last year's
winner in Hirsch's category (it was Nigel Hawthorne in Shadowlands).
Though the stated purpose of the Tony Awards is to honour excellence in the
Broadway theatre, everyone in town knows that what the Tonys are really
about is money: Tony-winning productions attract audiences. The commercial
fallout from the awards began the day after the ceremony, when productions
which struggled through in the vain hope of winning awards and a boost at
the box office started posting their closing notices; the first casualty was
Manhattan Theatre Clubs' Productions version of Alan Ayckbourn's A Small
Family Business.
The Tony Awards system fails to acknowledge that, with a few rare
exceptions, excellent work does not originate on Broadway any more. Anything
good is more likely to be an imported profit-driven star vehicle like this
season's controversial Death and the Maiden. The creative work of the
American theatre now happens off Broadway, and in non-profit theatres and
experimental companies throughout the country. This year's ground-breaking
musicals were nurtured in the non-profit sector: Jelly's Last Jam was
developed at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles and Falsettos was born and
raised at New York's Playwrights Horizons. Of the nine plays nominated for
Tony awards this year, six originated in the American non-profit theatre;
Two Trains Running was supported by no less than five non-profit
institutions, along with the commercial Jujamcyn Organisation, before it
landed on Broadway.
The landscape of New York theatre is shifting and the line between
off-Broadway and Broadway starting to blur. Broadway's theatres are defined
by their size and geographical location - they must have 499 seats or more,
and must be located in the Broadway area (with a few exceptions). Several
large off-Broadway companies, including the Manhattan Theatre Club and
Playwrights Horizons, have ticket prices upwards of Dollars 35 with top
notch production values to match, and locations in or near the Broadway
area. What distinguishes these theatres, in the public's perspective, from
the non-profit Broadway companies - Lincoln Centre Theatres, Circle in the
Square, the National Actors Theatre, and the Roundabout Theatre Company -
which offers similar fare?
The exclusion of off-Broadway productions from the Tony awards is a pet
peeve of Frank Rich, the New York Times lead theatre critic. In an interview
this week Rich commented on the Tony system's limitations: 'It's as if
excellent films like sex, lies and videotape and The Player were made
ineligible for Academy awards just because they were produced outside a
studio, or a TV series like The Civil Wars was not eligible for an Emmy
because it was made by public television,' says Rich.
Dissatisfaction with the Tony system seems to be mounting. An article in
this week's Variety calls the awards a 'scandal', saying that many of the
650 producers, journalists, and other industry insiders who decide the
awards, ignore voting rules when casting their ballot. Voters who do not see
every show nominated in a category are not supposed to vote in that
category, but, according to Variety writer Jeremy Gerard, many still do.
Gerard cited the example of Metro, one of this year's least successful
musicals, which was nonetheless nominated for a Tony for best score. Less
than 75 industry voters actually came to see Metro, though hundreds voted in
the hotly contested best score category, Gerard said. The rules are broken
because the voting is not policed, and, according to Gerard, the Leage of
American Theatres and Producers, which administers the awards, does not seem
to care. Susan Harley of the Theatre League calls the Tony voting process an
'honour system'. Gerard calls it 'the industry's dirty little secret'.
Frank Rich doubts that the Tony system will change in the foreseeable
future. The Theatre League is an organisation with a vested interest in
maintaining the commercial system at the status quo. To give off-Broadway
theatres Tony eligibility would be to introduce competition that can mount
productions much more cheaply than Broadway producers can, since
off-Broadway does not pay union scale, and often has less elaborate
production values than Broadway. As long as there is a buck to be made on
Broadway, it seems, the Tonys will keep on going like they always have.
No plainer example of the problems with the Broadway system need be sought
than Mike Nichols' production of Ariel Dorfman's Death and the Maiden. The
play is much too threatening for Broadway. Dorfman's play is very, very good
but Tonys are awarded for productions as well as plays, and Nichols'
production is very, very bad, and did not deserve to be nominated.
Death and the Maiden is intense and searing; it is meant to raise a lot of
difficult questions. It is not a pleasant play. It is certainly not a
comedy, but that is how it comes off on Broadway. By the end of the first
act the audience should be climbing the walls, but in Nichols' production
they are rolling in the aisles. The scene where Paulina (Glenn Close)
reveals to Gerardo, her husband, (Richard Dreyfuss) exactly what tortures
were done to her is positively a laugh riot.
Close is the production's only saving grace and deserves the best actress
Tony she won for her committed performance. Nichols' focuses much of the
play's interest on Paulina and Gerardo's relationship, and particularly on
the husband's struggle between love for his wife, incredulity at the
extremity of her actions, and professional ambition; and this is where the
production really falls apart: Dreyfuss simply does not turn up the dial
high enough.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Arts: Multi-media movers - The duo behind the Montreux jazz
festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAZZ MUSIC rarely throws up the sort of sophisticated mover and shaker
encountered in the rock or film business. Two such artistic and
entrepreneurial dynamos are brought together in sleepy Montreux, however,
for a fortnight of considerable moving and shaking in July. The Swiss town's
jazz festival is co-produced by American arch-impresario Quincy Jones and
its founder, local whizz kid, Claude Nobs. With their guidance the event is
fast becoming a model multi-media 'happening'.
Montreux Jazz has always been one of the smallest music festivals in the
world yet at the same time one of the biggest. Its site, in the town's
stygian casino complex on the Swiss riviera, holds a meagre 4000 fans. But
its eclectic programmes, which stray from sophisticated jazz into
'adult-oriented rock', are impeccably recorded and syndicated to TV
audiences around Europe. Featured artists and their record company bosses
forego huge fees for the right to sell live albums with the Montreux name.
The person responsible for the event's pre-eminence over the last 25 years
is Claude Nobs, ex-chef and ex-Swiss tourist board svengali turned record
company executive and music promoter extraordinaire.
Now that he has joined forces with composer and entrepreneur Quincy Jones,
the Montreux fest seems assured of world domination. TV rights have been
sold in Japan, to the US Disney Channel, MTV and France's Canal. In
addition, spin-off festivals, programmed by the dynamic duo and bearing the
Montreux name, are being staged in Detroit, Atlanta, Tokyo and Rio de
Janeiro.
There are few names which attach to every kind of entertainment medium as
easily as that of Quincy Delight Jones. An almost spiritual intermediary
through his blissful arrangements for the writings of jazz music's finest,
producer of the world's biggest selling album (Michael Jackson's Thriller),
award winning film score writer (In the heat of the night) and film producer
(The Color Purple), he was voted entrepreneur of the year by USA Today in
1990.
He remains hip, however, and is expanding his interests in youth culture.
The Quincy Jones Entertainment Co is responsible for NBC's cult TV series
Fresh Prince of Bel Air while, under the auspices of Time Warner, he
launches a new magazine for hip-hoppers in September called Volume.
Now that le p'tit Nobs has the perfect foil for his own promotional talents
he says, only half joking, that he can't go on without him. Indeed, Q's act
of last year, his first as co-producer at Montreux, will be a hard one to
follow. Not only did he manage to persuade Miles Davis to play 'the old
stuff' one more time but he conducted the tormented genius in front of a
double orchestra of 54 top class musicians. This historic event, which took
place weeks before Davis died, was recorded by Nobs in stereo HDTV. An album
and a video, replete with nostalgic clips of Miles snarling at the camera to
'get out of my face', will be released by Qwest (A Warner Music Group
subsidiary run by Quincy) in September.
Nobs, whose day job is managing director of Warner Music Switzerland, makes
the contacts to facilitate such a package. Sony matches the Dollars 4m put
up by cigarette maker Lucky Strike in festival sponsorship with the loan of
its hi-tech HDTV hardware. The sophisticated recording studio of rock group
Queen is sequestered for the sound and in Gavin Taylor he has a top shelf
film director whose speciality is live music.
Nobs obsession to get it all down on tape has always been there. At his
luxurious chalet high above Lake Geneva, veteran motorbikes and 1950s juke
boxes vie for space with an archive containing film of every Montreux fest
in every conceivable format, as well as his own prodigious collection of
vinyl and CDs. The Smithsonian Institute has expressed an interest in the
Nobs archive, so valuable is it as a record of contemporary music.
Q has less academic ideas for the collection however: he sees the archive as
perfect base material for the new possibilities soon to be made available by
interactive multi-media technology. Multi-media refers to text, graphics,
video and sound. Q, like Nobs is a self-confessed 'tedologist' (someone who
is obsessed by the combination of technology, entertainment and design) and
uses the Montreux Miles footage as an example of what might be possible with
the type of new CDI equipment now available from Philips. Interacting with
CD and video technology, a user could contrast Miles' playing at past
festivals. It could even be possible to take a 'time-line' into the pianists
he used, for example, while watching and hearing Herbie Hancock, say.
'Interactive media can be used like an encyclopedia,' says Q the Ted, 'but
not a dry one.'
Q can still enjoy music without a mouse in hand, however. His playing days
were finished by a brain aneurysm in 1974 but he still likes to get in among
the action. For most of July he will be found rehearsing big bands and he
will be on the stand most nights, interacting for posterity, with the likes
Eric Clapton and Stephane Grappelli.
The Montreux Jazz Festival runs from 3-18 July. Abonnements are available
from Swiss Francs 155 for three nights up to Swiss Francs 1500 for a
festival VIP pass. For further information Tel. (Montreux) 21 963 8282/7474

FT  06 JUN 92 / Arts: Off the Wall - Heritage wagered on tax advantages
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   IT ALWAYS seemed highly unlikely

<TEXT>
Heritage Secretary David Mellor's pledge that he would go into purdah for
three months, mugging up on his briefs before he played God in his empire of
fun: the arts, heritage and sport. He enjoys doing things too much.
This week Mellor acted, and it is good news for art connoisseurs who support
Halifax Town Football Club. Wearing his cloth cap, as sports supremo, he
decreed that lower division clubs will not have to convert their terraces to
expensive seating, and, swiftly donning his top hat, he disclosed yesterday
that he was abandoning the policy of his predecessor, Tim Renton, that there
should be a list of art works of such national importance that they could
never be exported.
The idea of a List was at odds with Tory theology that owners could do what
they liked with their own; it also precipitated a flood of important Old
Master pictures on to the market - just in case the list became law and
reduced the value of their property. In short order a Holbein, a Canaletto
and two Rembrandts were allotted from aristocratic collections to the
salerooms. Mellor has stopped all this nonsense.
Instead of a list, he is promoting the alternatives. There are the
acceptance-in-lieu and private treaty sale schemes, with tax advantages if
heritage minded owners sell their works of art to museums rather than take a
gamble on the salerooms. There is Gift Aid, which to date has been more of
an idea than a reality. There is the financially bolstered National Heritage
Fund which helped save the Holbein for the National Gallery.
But significantly Mellor took on board the recommendations of Jonathan
Scott, chairman of the Export Committee on Works of Art. Last year the
Committee had its arm twisted and reluctantly came down in favour of a list
of unexportable treasures. What it really wanted was an extra Pounds
15m-Pounds 20m a year for the Heritage Fund from the Government. This would
enable it to keep in the UK most of the major works of art threatened with
export. Mellor did not promise an uplift, but he said that he would do his
darndest to get the money from the Treasury. In the longer, 1994 term, of
course, revenue from a national lottery would come to the aid of the
heritage.
Mellor is confident that he can save the Lottery from the claw of the
Treasury. He envisages an income of up to Pounds 1.5b a year, with tax,
administration and prizes consuming not much more than half this sum. The
arts, heritage and sport will receive fixed percentages of the remainder,
with a little going to charities and the Millennium Fund. All the
government's plans for the arts depend upon a successful Lotteries Act.
                         *      *      *
So farewell Basildon Theatre - there is more drama at your passing than
anything that appeared on your stage. The decision by the newly elected
Conservative council in the Essex town to make its first act the curtailing
of its annual grant of Pounds 425,000 to the Towngate Theatre must have sent
a shiver through all the other local authority funded theatres. The Towngate
proved the point that such a theatre could not survive without subsidy by
peremptorily closing down.
But by a happy chance, just as one theatre in a London satellite town goes
under another surfaces. The curtain rises on the New Victoria, the main
auditorium at the Peacocks Arts &amp; Entertainment Centre in Woking next
Tuesday. Here is a very different approach to supplying the cultural needs
of the community - Woking has handed over the job to private enterprise by
insisting that an arts centre was included in the retail development of the
town. The Peacocks has two theatres, three cinemas, a nightclub, a couple of
restaurants and a library.
The most interesting part is the main theatre which, with 1300 seats, is the
largest to be built in the UK for years. Suddenly Woking, from being a
hotbed of amateur theatricals, becomes the natural last post for plays bound
for the West End. On June 16 Shades by Sharman Macdonald (of When I was a
girl . fame) opens there, starring Pauline Collins and directed by Simon
Callow, prior to London. With its big potential box office, technical
facilities and nearness to London (which means that a cast does not have to
be bed and boarded), Woking will soon become familiar to critics, actors and
theatrical groupies.
The New Victoria is run by Woking Turnstyle, a subsidiary of Howard Panter's
Turnstyle Group. He has forged links with the Theatre Royal Bath, and aims
to produce three or four new productions a year to visit these two, and
other theatres. New drama product is in short supply and regional theatres
increasingly depend on touring ballet companies to pay the bills: the New
Victoria's first offering is the Northern Ballet Theatre's controversial
Swan Lake. Panter is also talking to Glyndebourne Opera, which is interested
in alternative venues during 1993 while its new auditorium is being
constructed.
                         *      *      *
The attendance on the first day of the Olympia Antiques Fair on Thursday
approached 6,000, almost double the level of a year ago. How very wise of
the antique collecting classes] This Olympia is bursting at the seams, with
400 dealers desperate to sell. Business in the past 18 months has been
abysmal, and if they cannot shift stock during the next eight days it could
be curtains for many dealers. So get haggling.
Olympia panders to the middle market. On Wednesday the Grosvenor House Fair
opens, geared to big money collectors. Its symbol this year is a bronze
American 19th century weathervane, shaped as an Indian archer. It is on loan
from the American Museum at Bath and symbolises the Grosvenor theme, '500
Years of American patronage', a brave ploy to tempt over American buyers,
absent in recent years. By a nice irony an identical archer can currently be
bought in London - for Pounds 16,500 from John Bird and Lennox Catto's stand
at Olympia.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Arts: Timeless melancholia - Poetry in performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL GLOVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY APPEARED from the back of the stage at the Hay-on-Wye Literary Festival
all of a rush, Wales' 'greatest living harpist', Elinor Bennett, and its
'greatest living poet and bird watcher', RS Thomas, as if a mighty gust of
wind had driven them forward. And that gust was strong enough to carry
Thomas, a desperately shy man now in his 80th year who, according to his
publisher, does not read newspapers, does not possess a television and, from
the evidence before our eyes, had no relish to cross swords with an audience
either, right off the edge of the stage and into the first row of the
audience.
What was happening? The harpist was playing first, of course. They would
take it in turns. Thomas had seen no good reason to stand up there and be
gawped at just for the sake of it. When he returned, magnificent brown
brogues creaking as he clomped up the steps to the stage, old canvas bag
swinging from his shoulder, he had a fixed, determined expression upon his
face, as if to say: I shall do it, having given my word.
The first poem, 'The Minister', took us back to the early 1950s when Thomas
was still a minister of the church, observing the hard-bitten life of the
local farmers in that untamed land west of the valleys. The lectern he read
at was a simple, low wooden affair of the kind that some itinerant Wesleyan
might have fulminated from; and it was quite overshadowed by Elinor's
massive, sumptuous harp, all brilliant high varnish, gold leaf dragons and
ferocious clawed feet.
Thomas's poetry has become sparer and sparer as the years have passed by,
and so has his face: gaunt, sunken cheeks and deep, vertical furrows. The
voice is a thin incantatory wail, the accent meticulously English. The
pursed lips tremble furiously. It sounds like the recording of some old poet
reading - Tennyson or Yeats perhaps - from which all the buzz and the
crackle has been miraculously removed.
And the themes themselves, thanks to that voice, take on the resonance of
distant things, fabulously out of reach of our modern consciousness - all
that anguishing over the immanence of God, for example. His occasional
comments upon the poems - they are so few as to make them all the more
memorable - bring us up short by their quaintness. 'This is an ejaculation,'
he says of a religious poem entitled 'H'm'. 'You can say it whatever way you
please. Those who don't like me say hmm . . .' It is a rare moment of humour
too. The voice and even the angle of the body seem to be set in an attitude
of almost timeless melancholia: the world of RS Thomas has been distilled to
a thin keen of religious lamentation.
The poetry of RS Thomas is published by Bloodaxe Books.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Arts: Friel's 'Philadelphia' revisited - David Murray finds
no weak link in this excellent production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TRIUMPH of Brian Friel's Dancing at Lughnasa, gently resounding far and
wide, has already prompted a happy Royal Court revival of his earlier play
The Faith Healer. Now the King's Head has brought back his first
international success, the 1964 Philadelphia, Here I Come] Given the loving
commitment of Dan Crawford's production and his cast, the size of London's
Irish community and the minuscule scale of this pub-theatre, it could play
to full houses far beyond its promised six weeks - except that it employs 14
excellent actors, more than any fringe theatre can afford for long.
The young Gareth of Philadelphia . . . ] hasn't got there yet. He is
spending the last night of his youth in tiny Ballybeg, Co. Donegal, before
he absconds to the City of Brotherly Love, where his Americanised aunt Lizzy
and a new job await him. Seeing everything now - home, friends and life in
Ballybeg - for what may be the last time, he sees it all as if for the
first.
'Gar' (Jonathan Arun, honestly sensitive and gauche) lives with his widowed
father and their elderly housekeeper Madge. In the course of this final
night at home, he bids many farewells: to his former schoolmaster, to old
Canon O'Byrne (who always turns up, as Madge remarks, after the Rosary has
been recited but before the tea-kettle is put on), to a trio of
schoolfriends, to young Kate who married somebody else. Deft flashbacks show
us more of them.
As we expect, these encounters are variously poignant, funny and
frustrating. Since the basic situation is a familiar archetype, there are
attendant risks of stereotyping and all too heartfelt autobiography; but
Friel evades them with an inspired device. On stage the 'public' Gar has a
wry alter ego (Brendan Coyle) as constant companion, invisible to others.
Though the cast-list calls him the 'private' Gar, he does more than
articulate Gar's unspoken reactions on the spot; he also reviews the scene
from a standpoint of beady-eyed maturity.
Thus Friel contrives brilliantly to have his cake and eat it. 'Public' Gar
can play out his serial partings at full sentimental value, touchingly
strangulated, whilst 'private' Gar sets them in ironic, disillusioned focus.
Many a dramatic hero or heroine before Philadelphia . . .] has been assigned
an alter ego, metaphorical or literal, but I recall none who serves just
this function to such astringent effect.
Meanwhile all the other people, unaware of how they really fit into Gar's
scheme of things, can be played at juicy face-value, and they are. There is
no weak link in this expert cast, too numerous to praise adequately - but I
have to mention the radiantly gormless, self-deluding local lads (Ruairi
Conaghan, George Heslin and Aidan Dooley), and Frank Dunne's Canon, a bland
old crocodile. Pauline Delany's Madge and Eamon Kelly's Dad (his role in the
original staging]) convey unshakeable character behind their tight-lipped
words. Valerie Hermanni makes a fine, flamboyant Aunt Lizzy on her flashback
visit home, with David Duffy sweetly embarrassed as her American husband.
There have been many plays in this tenderly distanced autobiographical vein,
like everybody's first novel. What distinguishes Friel's is not only its
eventful concision and pace (thoroughly 'professional' work in the best
sense), nor the extra depths it reaches through 'private' Gar, but a kind of
livid, affectionate fury. Fury over the Ballybeg brain-death he escapes so
narrowly; but also furious about his own stubborn incapacity to make peace
with his decent, blinkered folk. For once the anxious hero isn't a budding
Artist (ie the author) whose vocation demands transplanting to a larger pot,
but just an averagely shrewd Irishman who sees no way out but out, and finds
that painful beyond expectation.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Arts: All hung up in Piccadilly - Patricia Morison braves
the crowds at the RA's Summer Exhibition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GERMAN friend has just asked me why anyone gives a damn for the Royal
Academy's Summer Exhibition. Inching around the hot, foetid, crowded
galleries was an experience she rated on a par with rush-hour on the
Northern Line. And as for the critics pretending to review this artistic
equivalent of the Tower of Babel, who are they trying to kid?
Of course the Summer Exhibition, now in its 224th year, is not everyone's
glass of Pimms. As my fair-minded friend noticed, the whole way the thing
works is indeed deeply random. This year, some 12,000 works were submitted
out of which the hanging committee of Royal Academicians selected 1,736
works for exhibition. Academicians themselves, it is worth remembering, get
their six works in nem. con.
Even if everything exhibited were a masterpiece, it is obviously impossible
to judge the merits of such a sheer quantity of stuff - or indeed, even to
see it. Many paintings are 'skied', hung so high that small ones become
pretty near invisible. And it is a pretty horrible way to treat paintings,
to cram small works - landscapes, portraits (human and animal), still lives
 -virtually frame to frame in the notorious Small South Room.
But then, that's the way it has always been, and even in Babel it was no
doubt possible to pick out individual voices. And that is any serious
art-lover's best hope of the Summer Exhibition. This year, moreover, they
have been fiddling about to improve the hang, although not in the end to
much effect. Unfortunately, the most obvious consequence has been that Peter
Blake has spread the vulgar principle of 'pack 'em in' over into Gallery IX.
An extraordinary jumble of 300 images covers every inch of wall, all of them
representational, most very small.
How democratic in spirit, one might feel; how nice that all those amateur
artists can even get their pictures into the Show at all. Or is it not
merely patronising, to treat the work of fellow artists as if they were no
better than picture postcards in a collage? It is a triumph that even in
this Liquorice Allsorts nightmare, Patrick Procktor's 'Cape Coloured' stands
out, a sombrely elegant painting not undermined by the feeble pun of hanging
it beside two other paintings which also feature park benches prominently.
As for the first gallery with its international big guns - Tapies, Clemente,
Baselitz - it looked even more of a disjointed mess than last year.
Sculpture, too, was a real disappointment. Another year, there should be a
separate sculpture showing in the upstairs gallery - assuming there really
is some decent work to show. This year, I gave it a circuit all of its own,
but it made no difference. Pretty well all of it struck me as dull or simply
ghastly.
One exception was Linda Bareham-Stanley's 'Dying Man', a polished male torso
resting against a pillow of rough-hewn rock. I really enjoyed Bryan Kneale's
sculptures, especially his large, skeletal 'Pelican', a study of the
preposterousness clumsiness of the beast. Kneale's sketches of a nude were
powerful and sexy. Curiously enough, the show is remarkably short of good
nudes, apart from Nicholas Granger-Taylor's small and highly accomplished
studies.
I simply report that Sandra Blow's 'Whisperings' won the Charles Woollaston
award for most distinguished work. It did nothing for me. Winner of the
Korn-Ferry Award was Michael Andrews's 'A View from Uamh Mhor', one of the
most monumental works in the exhibition. It is a good painting for Rio week.
Drips slide down the canvas, blending sky into mountains, from mountains
into streams. This is a romantic panorama of an eco-system, grand and
untouched by man - and finally, a little dull and over-blown.
Several RAs were noticeably disappointing, among them Leonard Rosoman's
portraits. That said, once more I found immediate and intense pleasure in
the work of Peter Greenham, in Ben Levene's still life, Jennifer Dickson's
etchings of magical gardens, Philip King's vibrant self-portraits, and
Richard Eurich's seascapes. These last looked well grouped beside intensely
glowing pastels of sea and river by Richard Cartwright. He is one of my
discoveries of the Show, as is John Rushton in the last gallery, where it is
all too easy to skimp. I like his deft, extremely muted watercolour
portraits.
Returning to old favourites, Carel Weight has a wonderful showing this year,
with his figures in suburban streets and parks who convey that intangible
feeling that something is terribly wrong. 'Old Man in the Snow' has but one
figure, but conveys equally well the sense of suppressed terror.
Mick Rooney also has a strong show with his own mysterious scenes of
peasant-looking, even folksy types, trapped in claustrophobically cluttered
rooms.
A little painting, 'The Estuary' by Peter Kelly, was hung rather high but,
with that caveat, tremendously took my fancy for the loneliness conveyed by
the simple image of an elderly man gazing out at the sea. Michael Upton's
paintings I also marked as exerting a quiet magic. So yes, 1992 is by the
lights of this peculiar event, a good show, and the voices did speak from
the cacophony.
The Summer Exhibition continues at the Royal Academy, Burlington House until
August 16 in association with Guinness plc

FT  06 JUN 92 / Gardening: Heavenly hostas on the march - A genus that took
the US by storm but is harder to find in Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOSTAS have had a lot of publicity in the UK in recent years, although
nowhere near as much as in the United States, where most of the new
varieties have been bred. Hostas have become a cult there, and some gardens
are devoted to them almost exclusively.
One such is the garden of Wolfram George Schmid in Georgia. He even calls
his house Hosta Hill. H grows little else. Even calls his house Hosta Hill;
he grows little else. His His latest book, The Genus Hosta, is a weighty
tome of 428 pages (Batsford, Pounds 45).
You would scarcely think that a genus of only about 40 species, more or less
confined in the wild to Japan, China and Korea, would generate enough
material to fill a book of this size. But Schmid is nothing if not thorough;
he has a great deal to say about hostas in the garden as well as devoting a
whole section of the book to the species.
These he has considered critically, with the object, in some cases, of
re-classifying them. Classification is, however, a matter of opinion - of
putting together the facts of evolution as they appear to the observer. And
these opinions are unlikely to tally exactly with those of other observers
who have studied the subject equally exhaustively.
What is notable in Britain is that the number of varieties of hosta
available in the large nurseries dealing with herbacious perennials -
particularly those supplied in garden centres - has increased only a little
over the past 10 years. Anyone who wants to look at the several hundred
hostas available in the UK will have to search for them mostly in small,
specialist nurseries (of which, luckily, the UK has many).
This is where The Plant Finder becomes indispensable, for it devotes nearly
five pages to the genus hosta: close on 500 names (although some of these
are synonyms). It is quite remarkable that only 13 are described as being
'widely available.' These 13 are August Moon, fortunei albopicta, fortunei
aureomarginata, Francis Williams, Ginko Craig, Halcyon, Honey Bells, Krossa
Regal, lancifolia, sieboldiana and its variety elegans, undulata
albomarginata, and uldulata undulatum.
One of them turned Wolfram Schmid into a hosta fan. He explains that his
ideal garden is a place of refuge from an increasingly synthetic world;
tapestries of colour do not fit in with this tranquil goal. Yet, he found
his perfect perennial in one of its borders.
It was a stately mound of large, heart-shaped leaves, dusted with a
comforting, deep, blue-grey frosting, almost 3 ft high. The leaves were
over-topped by sturdy stems bearing white flowers. When he found the label,
it read Siebold's Funkia - the old name for what is now hosta sieboldiana.
That was more than 40 years ago. Since then, Schmid has come a long way in
his appreciation of hostas.
Hostas are very easy to grow but not, perhaps, quite so easy to grow really
well. For best leaf production they need shade, but for flower production
they are better in sun (although this can scorch their leaves). They enjoy
plenty of humus in the soil - leaf mould, peat, spent mushroom compost or
just well-rotted manure - and they also like moisture; but all these also
attract slugs and snails, which are the hosta's worst enemies.
Schmid says the Japanese accept this as an inevitable part of hosta
cultivation, and illustrate hostas complete with slug or snail holes. But I
do not think their tolerance would stretch to the tattered remnants which,
in some favourite varieties - usually the heavily variegated ones - are all
that remain in my snail-infested garden. Slug baits or traps are the obvious
answer, and I can only plead that I do not have time to apply these
efficiently.
Hostas are not very good plants for nurserymen because they grow rather
slowly. In the garden, they certainly should not be lifted and divided
frequently. Micro-propagation is possible but highly specialised; it is most
practical when large numbers of plants are required. I do not know to what
extent it has been used by nurserymen. Schmid does not have much to say
about it.
A peculiarity of some species is their readiness to produce variegated
leaves: splashed or striped or banded with white, yellow or chartreuse
green. Sometimes this colouring can envelope the whole leaf, and I have
noticed at flower shows that there is a tendency to exhibit a predominant
number of these varieties so that the impression from a short distance is of
a golden display.
This is very beautiful, but in the garden there is a lot to be said for the
all-green leaves, especially those with the blue-grey frosting that so
enraptured Schmid when he found his first sieboldiana. Last week I was
looking at some large clumps of this variety, toning down the hot colours of
Ghent and Mollis azaleas - just the kind of thing I imagine Schmid would not
like. But I found it a delightful piece of planting which would last in that
brilliantly contrasted form for only a few weeks, afterwards relapsing into
tranquillity.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Gardening: It's pot luck for the leaders of the pack /
Finding that the impatient have inherited the earth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year, impatient gardeners have got away with murder. They have broken
the rules, kicked over the calendar and bedded-out plants which are
marginally hardy at a season when wise old gardeners expect a lot to be
killed by frost. In fact, they have flourished. They love the sun, respond
to the rain and, already, they are out of reach of frost. It is all most
irritating. To put it bluntly: Sloane-Wallies swept in at the first sign of
sunshine and acquired most of the summer's decoration before well-trained
gardeners like myself were ready to buy it when the text books recommend.
Admittedly, I would never stuff it in a hanging basket or grow it in
anything which dangled. Most of the plants sold in strips are not my idea of
elegance. I do not want petunias with flowers as broad as the mouth of a
trombone, and I certainly do not want fluffy ageratum. Be wary of strips
unless they contain pure-white tobacco plants, which look lovely anywhere.
Otherwise, remember that soft planting has gained new dimensions in the past
20 years and most of the best things are sold individually in pots among
half-hardy perennials.
The new art of pot-planting is to pack in as much as you possibly can. If
you can afford them, clay pots with a 27-inch diameter allow you the most
scope. I have stuck at 20-24 inches, but only because pots are a small part
of my garden and I am not stuck with nothing more than a roof or balcony.
Weather-beaten Sloanes in the countryside swear by the hand-made articles
from Whichford Pottery, Ascott, Warwickshire, spearheaded by the experienced
Jim Keeling. He has the right combination of clay all over his trousers and
a sharp eye for shape and design. The results are not cheap but they do
withstand British winters. Plainer, less winter-proof pottery is available
much more cheaply from Homebase and other DiY stores.
I have my own top 10 among plants but, like all such lists, they change from
time to time. Part of the art is to use a good silver-leaved companion in
order to soften the stronger colours. My favourite is the familiar
helichrysum petiolatum because it trails, rather than flops, and is a good,
felted grey.
The leaves are cut much more finely on my other favourite, the white senecio
leucostachys, which will climb to a height of 3 ft or so if you train its
main stem up a central cane. For subtlety and season, I still put a
particular verbena called Silver Anne in the number one slot. Again, it will
trail or tumble, and its pink flowers have an unusally soft quality.
Cherry Pie is an essential plant for scent, but most of the forms in seed
catalogues are virtually odourless and the flowers are too showy. The best
varieties have to be bought as pot-grown plants from cuttings - probably
after reference to their name, heliotropium, in The Plant Finder.
Heliotrope is a fine plant from the past, but the future might well lie with
bright forms of evergreen mimulus which are starting to reach us now from
California. The easiest to find is mimulus glutinosus which is evergreen,
sun-loving and orange-flowered without being common.
Other forms have pink or even lemon-yellow flowers; and, although none is
hardy, the entire branch of the family is excellent value at a height and
width of about 2 ft.
Their natural companions are the daisy-flowered osteospermums, which took a
beating in the cold winter but are now back in force in garden centres. The
taller the variety, the less it is hardy; but, in pots, nobody minds a
short-lived visitor and the best is still the tall yellow-flowered
Buttermilk. It looks charming with yellow lilies in a sunny place.
Numbers seven to 10 on the list have no better chance of surviving the frost
but they are coloured wonderfully while they last. The spiky flowers of
diascia rigescens are the prettiest pink in the family and last until late
October if you cut off the dead heads. I like them among the greyish pink
and maroon-centred flowers of a mallow which grows about 2 1/2 ft high:
lavatera maritima bicolor.
Lastly, a pairing of cherry-red and slate blue. Almost all the half-hardy
salvias are excellent for big pots but my favourites are still the very
similar grahamii and the cherry-red neurepia. Again, they are rounded shrubs
which grow freely to a height and width of more than 2 ft in a season. I
like to see them with the silky, slate-blue flowers of convolvulus
mauretanicus, which will trail harmlessly over the edge of any big pot.
After-care is extremly simple. The main problems are watering and feeding,
specially if you pack your plants together. The bother is greatly reduced if
you work a water-retaining compound into the soil before planting.
Enthusiasts tell me the best variety is Broadleaf P4, made by Agricultural
Polymers of Merchants Road, Gloucester (tel. 0452-21733). If its granules
are added to the soil in a pot, they can cut down watering to one day a week
instead of three.
As for feeding, you can then kill both jobs at once. Mix in the prescribed
dose of the admirable Phostrogen into your watering can and feed and water
in one wherever you have packed plants tightly together. Let the
water-absorbent granules do the rest and you can admire your elegant results
while other people's petunias have started to shrivel.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Motoring: Smile please, you are speeding - The cameras which
catch naughty motorists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A few weeks the first automatic cameras will click into action on
Britain's motorways, snapping drivers who are breaking the speed limit.
Fixed penalty notices for the registered owners, identified through the DVLC
computer, will follow.
Britons have become hardened to being caught speeding by hand-held radar
guns. But radar-linked automatic cameras recording speed, time and date on a
picture showing the car's number plate are something else. Their use in
Britain became possible only when the Road Traffic Act was amended last year
to allow computer technology to be used as evidence.
Continental European motorists have, however, learned to live with them.
Especially in the Netherlands. For a long time, computer technology has been
making life difficult and expensive for Dutch motorists who break speed
limits, shoot traffic lights or park where they should not.
The Dutch replaced old-fashioned police tickets, and even older-fashioned
court summonses, for minor motoring offences 10 years ago. Since then, the
numbers detected and penalties paid has soared to 4m a year - and the
population of Holland is only 15m.
The 4m includes illegal parking as well as minor driving offences. As they
are growing at an annual rate of 20-25 per cent, the penalties are clearly a
nice little earner for the Dutch government.
Britain's motorists and lorry drivers are unlikely to be more law-abiding
and the UK population is nearly four times as great. When the motorway radar
cameras go into action this summer, speeding will be financially riskier
than it is today.
Will the methods now used to enforce payment of fixed penalty notices
(tickets) cope? Or will drivers, caught on camera, ignore penalty demands,
hoping sheer numbers will swamp the system and let them get away with it?
Many did in London when they ignored parking tickets wholesale in
pre-clamping days.
When the Dutch first deployed unmanned electronics against erring drivers,
the enforcement problem was tackled simultaneously. Traffic offences like
speeding, passing red lights and parking where it was forbidden were
decriminalised. The penalties they attracted were treated as automatic civil
taxes. As there were no contestable court summonses, the police were not
involved and the workload on the courts was slashed.
A separate central justice cashing office (CJIB) was set up. Although
independent of the police, its sophisticated computer software incorporates
the police data communication system. This notifies the police if an
electronically detected traffic offence leads to an accident. The average
time between the electronic detection of a motoring offence and the payment
demand dropping on the doormat of the car's registered owner is two weeks.
About 90 per cent of offenders pay straight away although, at the beginning
of the scheme, only 15 per cent did. One reason for the prompter payment
might be that, after one reminder, non-payers are visited by a process
server. If the money is not produced then and there, the process server can
seize the motorist's goods, like a bailiff. Laggards have found it better to
hand over the cash than lose their TV or video.
What happens to motorists who say: 'But it wasn't me the camera caught?'
They can appeal, but only after the penalty has been paid. Unlike Britain,
the Dutch have no totting-up system with points awarded for each offence
leading to automatic loss of licence when the total is 12. But the computer
detects persistent offenders and tells the CJIB, which can take them to
court.
Penalties for more serious motoring offences are severe. Drivers who break
the speed limit by more than 50 kph (31 mph) are liable to have their cars
and their driving licences impounded on the spot. When they appear before a
court it can order the car to be seized and sold, with the government
keeping the proceeds. This melancholy fate befell the driver of a Ferrari
unwise enough to do 150 mph (241 kph) - more than twice the legal limit - on
a Dutch motorway.
But the courts can be lenient. If the speeding was on a dry and deserted
road and no danger was involved, the driver may keep his car. The fine,
though, will still be heavy.
Could Dutch-style computerised enforcement happen in Britain? It could, but
not yet. A company called CMG (Computer Management Group), with an eye to
lucrative sales of its know-how and software, has kept the Home Office and
police authorities abreast of what has been happening in the Netherlands.
So far, only polite interest has been shown. The official view is that
British individual regional police forces will be able to cope, as they do
with fixed penalty notices. Will they? Only time will tell.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Motoring: A truly super Trooper
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL

<TEXT>
'GRANDPA'S van]' exclaimed (not quite) two-year-old Sophie, the apple of my
eye, as the Isuzu Trooper crunched to a halt on the gravel drive of
Honeysuckle Cottage in darkest Dorset.
I knew what she meant. The high roof that lets this big 4x4 estate carry
five people in some luxury - and two more sitting sideways without serious
squashing - does give it a slightly commercial look.
But none of the current crop of recreational four-wheel drives could really
be less van-like than the 3.1 litre turbo-diesel engined Trooper LWB Duty I
drove for more than 600 miles (1,000 km) during a weekend last month.
Independent front suspension (a feature found in only one class rival, the
Mitsubishi Shogun) makes it ride and handle more like a car than an on-off
road vehicle.
Clutch and 5-speed gearshift are as light as a small hatchback's and the
steering is effortlessly power-assisted.
The engine, like the smaller Isuzu turbo-diesels used in the Vauxhall Nova
and Cavalier, is a gem. It is almost as quiet as a Mercedes diesel  - praise
comes no higher - and vigorous enough to let this big 4x4 keep up easily
with the motorway pack. Yet it gave me 27 mpg (10.46 1/100 km) over 620
miles (1,000 km). This included a 151-mile (243 km) journey, mainly on motor
ways but with some A and B roads, in 150 minutes, an average speed of
exactly 60 mph (96 kph).
The Trooper's excellent economy is helped by quite high gearing (25
mph/40kph at 1,000 rpm in top) and selectable four-wheel drive. On road,
only the rear wheels are driven; the front ones free-wheel on hubs that lock
automatically only when four-wheel drive is engaged.
At Pounds 17,998 the Trooper LWB turbo-diesel is the same price as the 3.2
litre V6 petrol model. It is comprehensively equipped and I rate it a best
buy in its class.
For Pounds 2,200 more there are Citation versions (pictured) with extra
goodies such as alloy wheels, ABS brakes and air conditioning.

Paeonia suffruticosa This is the moutan, the most opulent of the shrubby
peonies, which has been developed highly in gardens, both in China - where
it is native - and in other parts of the world. The flowers of the wild
plant are single and usually white, with a big maroon blotch at the base of
each broad petal and a cluster of yellow stamens in the centre. But garden
varieties can be pink, red or magenta and may be semi or fully
double-flowered.
All tend to make rather leggy bushes, a habit that can be improved by
careful pruning after flowering. They like good, humus-rich soil and a
sheltered position where they wll not be exposed to spring frosts which can
damage the young growth, although mature stems and leaves are hardy.

TRANSIT OF VENUS: TRAVELS IN THESOUTH PACIFIC by Julian Evans Secker &amp;
Warburg Pounds 16.99, 277 pages
PILGRIM OF THE VOID by Kenneth White Mainstream Pounds 14.99, 254 pages
PRE-publication hype is getting more and more serious. Nowadays, books have
to be garlanded with pre-pub quotes. You know the sort: 'The best book on
Corgi breeding I have ever read' - Queen Elizabeth II; 'A wonderful
introduction to developing your personality. Invaluable bedtime reading' -
John Major.
The pre-pub quote that accompanies Transit of Venus is from Norman Lewis, no
less. Lewis is in the premier division of travel writers. 'Transit of Venus
is the best book about the South Seas I have ever read. Julian Evans is the
Robert Louis Stevenson of the post-nuclear Pacific,' he says.
Post-nuclear Pacific? Robert Louis Stevenson? Mid-way through the book, I
thought that Lewis had flipped; by the end, I was happily changing my mind,
for Julian Evans builds his story well and is a meticulous, vivid writer -
reminiscent of Lewis himself.
Evans starts in Sydney. He goes to New Caledonia, Fiji, Samoa, Tonga,
Tuvalu, Kiribati and finally the Marshall Islands, including the military
base at Kwajalein and the island ghetto of Kili. By the time he reaches the
Marshalls he is close to despair, and little wonder. In the Marshalls,
everyone sleeps with everyone, gets syphilis, gets treated, sleeps with
everyone else again.
The Marshallese, says Evans, do not see the point of contraception, so the
president had imported 15m tonnes of California's domestic garbage to create
lagoon landfills - 'a brilliantly simple scheme in which the government
would be paid Dollars 140m by grateful waste disposal companies and
potentially end up doubling the land area of Majuro island . . . in 10 years
time he would be able to say he was president of the biggest garbage dump in
the Pacific.' This is a bleak book. Robert Louis Stevenson or not, Evans is
honest and shrewd: a first-rate reporter.
Pilgrim of the Void is not an easy read, but perhaps the fault is mine.
Kenneth White, says his publisher, was born in Glasgow, settled in France in
1967 and holds the chair of 20th century poetics at the Sorbonne. He has won
prizes, and is an expert on post-modernity, but can't be all bad.
Pilgrim of the Void starts in Hong Kong, moves to Macao and Taiwan, then
Thailand and Japan. Here is a typical passage (the author is taking a train
from Kowloon to Shatin, to visit the 10,000 Buddha Temples): 'There was a
little beauty in the carriage, one of these beauties that grace South China,
only 16 years old, the kind of girl described in the beautiful Cantonese
phrase ham bao doi fong (flower blossom waiting open). Ah yes, lovely,
perfect loveliness - ni ho lei, little girl, ni ho lei, ni ho lei], shall I
say it a hundred times under my breath, like a prayer?' Either this is a
reasonably good travel book, or else a load of tosh. I expect I read it too
quickly. I will now read it slowly.

books delivering mighty blows for good sense

<TEXT>
SEX AND REASON by Richard A Posner Harvard Pounds 23.95, 458 pages
GIRLS LEAN BACK EVERYWHERE by Edward de Grazia Constable Pounds 19.95, 814
pages
SEX IS a controversial subject because most people are more interested in it
than informed about it, and because its urgencies and ecstasies make it
threatening. Sexual pleasure, said Aristotle, impedes rationality, and his
remark is the premise for persistent hostility from religions and rulers: if
sex is irrational it is a threat to order and therefore authority.
In consequence sexuality has been constrained by laws and customs in most
cultures throughout history, with Christianity as the worst offender. In
1808 more people were hanged in England for sodomy than murder; in the
Middle East adulterers are still stoned to death; in most countries
censorship of art continues on 'obscenity' grounds. As a further consequence
sex is shrouded in hypocrisy, guilt, exploitation, anxiety and perversion,
adding fuel to its fires and making it a real rather than merely perceived
problem.
In Richard Posner's view a chief reason for repressive public policy towards
sexuality is ignorance. Despite the increased openness which permitted
Kinsey, Masters and Johnson to undertake their celebrated research, there is
still no widely accepted theory of sexuality upon which public policy-making
can rely. Posner seeks to supply it. And as he shows, there has never
existed greater need for it than now, because sexuality is currently
offering Western society dramatic challenges: the AIDS epidemic, abortion,
contraception, surrogate motherhood, artificial fertilisation, homosexual
demands for the repeal of sodomy laws and the right to marry and adopt
children, teenage sex and pregnancy, 'obscenity' complaints over art funding
by government, sexual harassment, marital and 'date' rape, child abuse,
pornography - all are severely straining the American legal system. Where
America leads, others soon follow.
Posner is an Appeal Court judge on the US Seventh Circuit, and a lecturer in
law at Chicago University. He is a prolific writer on legal and social
issues, famous (or notorious) not just for his prodigious output but his
championing of free-market economics and his application of its principles
to legal and social analysis.
In this book Posner applies economics to the task of explaining sexuality.
The idea is not as odd as it first seems. Economics is the science of
rational behaviour, where by 'rational' is meant the appropriate fitting,
whether conscious or otherwise, of means to ends. It may seem quixotic to
apply a theory of rational choice to sex, given the latter's problematic
irrationality, but although sexual instincts are biological, the strategies
people adopt to satisfy them are rational. Consider the analogy of hunger:
we do not will hunger, but we take thought about appeasing it.
Posner analyses sex in cost-benefit terms. Among the benefits are pleasure
and progeny; among the costs, the effort of finding a mate, averting rivals,
and tending offspring. A simple example is afforded by 'opportunistic
homosexuality' among men in prison who, usually heterosexual, turn to
homosexuality because in the circumstances the benefits outweigh the costs.
So stated the theory seems simplistic, but Posner carefully elaborates it
for a whole range of sexual transactions, showing how cost calculations
influence behaviour.
The result is a surprisingly powerful model for understanding, for example,
differences in styles of marriage and attitudes to sexual practices across
societies and epochs. A major conclusion is that the occupational position
of women is a principal determinant. In societies where wives are uneducated
and much younger than husbands, companionate marriage cannot exist, so sex
is formal and occasional. Women are sequestered to 'protect their virtue',
but men are freely permitted extra-marital sex. In societies where women
have high status, as in the contemporary West, companionate marriage is the
norm, and prostitution, in earlier times a provider of what was in short
supply domestically - namely, normal sex - becomes a source of specialist
sex supplementing, without threatening, marriage.
Posner's intention is to reduce ignorance and prejudice among his fellow
judges and society at large, aiming to encourage more liberal attitudes to
sexuality. He admires the Swedes in this respect, and repeatedly cites them
as a model.
This is an outstanding and important book. Admirably written, it takes a
synoptic view of the huge literature on sexuality in many diverse fields,
and superinduces order on a riot of speculation. Of course the level of
generalisation is high, and of course analysing sexuality in economic terms
is controversial. But Posner's discussion is extraordinarily
thought-provoking. His liberalism will anger feminists, oddly allied to the
Right and the churches on many sexual questions; and both the Right (to
which Posner otherwise belongs) and the churches will be furious at his
belief that legal control is not appropriate for most aspects of sexuality.
This shows that Posner has struck a mighty blow for good sense.
In his early career Posner was an assistant to Justice William Brennan, who
was chiefly responsible for the liberalising decisions of the US Supreme
Court during the 1960s and 1970s, especially in obscenity cases. Part of
Edward de Grazia's aim in his excellent book is a celebration of Brennan's
now increasingly threatened achievements. But de Grazia's primary concern is
to show how, from the 1888 imprisonment of Henry Vizetelly for publishing
Zola in Britain, to the recent storm in America over Robert Mapplethorpe,
the struggle against obscenity laws has fared. The story covers Joyce,
Lawrence, Miller, Burroughs and other celebrated cases, in some of which de
Grazia himself - lawyer and playwright - took a leading role in the defence.
It is de Grazia's technique to let the documents speak for themselves,
interweaving a commentary. The result is riveting. Classic examples are
afforded by Mapplethorpe's homoerotic photographs and Andres Serrano's 'Piss
Christ'. Clearly the orifices penetrated furthest by Mapplethorpe were the
noses of the US Establishment, whose response, led by Senator Jesse Helms,
has been to threaten a new inquisition of censorship in American artistic
life. The passages quoted by de Grazia are exquisitely telling. The
intellectual conservatism of the Americans, illustrated on almost every
page, makes one gasp half in rage and half in incredulous laughter; either
way making for an extremely good, highly informative, and very sobering
read.

THE FABRICATION OF LOUIS XIV by Peter Burke Yale Pounds 19.95, 242 pages
NEXT TIME you stand beside the carousel at Heathrow or Houston, anxiously
waiting to be re-united with your baggage, spare a thought for Louis XIV. He
too spent much time at carousels but in the earlier sense of the word.
Originally it denoted an equestrian contest involving running at the ring
and other feats of skill on horseback.
Carousels were popular spectacles throughout the Renaissance, by which time
they had come to resemble elaborate equestrian ballets. Louis XIV loved them
not just as a spectator but as a participant. He used the carousel,
Cambridge historian Peter Burke tells us in this fascinating study, as one
means of imposing his image upon the French people and the world.
There was a famous carousel opposite the Tuileries in 1662 to celebrate the
recovery of Dunkirk by the French. The King dressed as emperor of the Romans
was the star of the show. The five teams of courtiers represented Romans,
Persians, Turks, Indians and Americans. Each of them had a device on his
shield. The king's was a sun-emblem with the inscription 'ut vidi vici' (as
I saw I conquered). This extravagant carousel was one of the major public
spectacles of his reign.
Louis would frequently appear on horseback to enhance his stature. Being
quite a small man, five foot three in fact, it helped to perpetuate his
image of ascendancy as the sun-king. So did high-heeled shoes he invariably
wore when not riding and the full-bottomed wig he used after an illness
caused his hair to fall out.
Burke goes over much ground already familiar in histories of this monarch
who carried the art of self-assertion to new heights but it has never been
documented so systematically before. Burke shows in fascinating detail how
the royal public relations machine actually worked, how craftsmen in all the
media - painters, sculptors, coin and medal engravers, poets, playwrights,
composers, ballet-masters - were all pressed into service to promote la
gloire . Louis never tired of the representation of his own public face, a
technique of royal self-promotion later monarchs like Queen Victoria
followed. Like her, one of his ploys was to have places named after him;
these survive today as far afield as Saarlouis in Germany and Louisiana in
America.
Among the many idealised illustrations of Louis, Burke reproduces a large
painting in 1673 by Pierre Mignard. The king is galloping across the low
countries; an angel flying above his steed is crowning him with a laurel
wreath. The painting celebrates 'Louis (victorious) at Maastricht'. Plus ca
change . . .
As a young monarch Louis sought advice on how to present himself from his
astute minister, Mazarin. But he was soon writing his own script. By the
time Mazarin died, he had a whole Department of Glory at work headed by
Colbert with people like Le Brun in charge of portraiture, the Perrault
brothers to write eulogies in prose and verse, Lully to compose celebratory
paeans in music. Royal processions, triumphal arches, firework displays,
medals commemorating victories and diplomatic successes, were all carefully
monitored and generously funded.
The praise-poem celebrating Louis's victories was not just an opportunity
for poetic hacks to advance their standing at court; it became an art-form
essayed by men of the highest genius such as Boileau and Racine. Both of
them held the post of historiographer royal and, as Burke points out,
history was at that period a literary genre.
'A work of history was expected to include a number of literary set-pieces
such as the 'character' or moral portrait of a ruler, minister or commander,
the vivid narrative of a battle, and the presentation of debates through
speeches attributed to leading participants (but frequently invented by the
historian).'
The best writers learnt how to accommodate a royal request without
compromising the integrity of their work. Moliere would sometimes have to
add a ballet onto a comedy, so that the king and his courtiers could dance
in it at the end of the performance. Racine's tragedy Alexandre contains a
flattering portrait of Louis as Alexander the Great, but it nonetheless
remains a good play revealing the politics of sexual passion.
Even with talents of this calibre to promote his image, Louis could not hope
to fool all of the people all of the time. Towards the end of the reign
there developed a fierce backlash against him. Discrepancies between the
official version of events and the realities had become all too apparent.
After the Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, Holland was an active centre of
counter-propaganda, fuelled by Huguenot refugees putting out scabrous
anti-Louis material.
Even in Versailles, which during Louis' reign assumed its position as the
monarch's principal place of residence and the epicentre from which his
sun's rays shone on those currently in his good graces, there were
dissenters, as we discover in the Historical Memoirs of the Duc de
Saint-Simon. Burke does full justice to the believers and the sceptics in
his study - a valuable contribution to the history of public relations.

<TEXT>
CHARLES JAMES FOX by L G Mitchell Oxford Pounds 25, 338 pages
AS FAMOUS parliamentary double-acts go, Fox and Pitt have never caught the
imagination as much as Gladstone and Disraeli, although the pair dominated
the politics of their day as surely as G &amp; D did 100 years later.
The contrast between them was just as marked: Pitt the professional
politician, the buttoned-up bachelor and (in his enemies' opinion) the
puppet of the potentially despotic George III; Fox the self-styled 'man of
the people', who could extemporise four-hour-long speeches to a packed
House, often after gaming at Brooks's until the early hours. Fox belonged to
an older style of politics, one in which loyalty to friends mattered as much
as political beliefs, and in which the pleasures of the world, of literature
(he was a brilliant classicist and linguist) and the Parisian high-life were
necessary adjuncts to the parliamentary grind.
Now LG Mitchell, one of Oxford's brightest young historians, has written the
definitive and (because he likes his subject so much) certainly the most
penetrating biography someone so unfathomable has inspired. Fox's
principles, even to his friends, seemed obscure often to the point of
deliberate obfuscation, and he has proved equally puzzling to subsequent
historians. Hailed as one of the founding fathers of Radicalism, he has been
just as vehemently depicted as an irresponsible impediment to the
statemanship of Pitt. Throughout his life he was suspected of being more in
sympathy with Britain's enemies than her allies. This was especially true
during the wars with America and France, both of which he opposed because he
believed they disguised the despotic ambitions of George III.
But Fox's career is really a study in political alchemy. The true magic lay
in the man rather than the message. Burke, long after the termination of his
political association with Fox, admitted that he was a 'man made to be
loved.' Long after Fox's death a diarist recorded that elderly Foxites,
remembering the loss of their mentor, would 'burst into tears with a
vehemence of grief such as I hardly ever saw exhibited by a man.'
Fox was a man of strong passions but few principles. He upheld toleration,
supporting the abolition of the slave trade and the extension of liberties
to Catholics and Dissenters: 'as someone who from infancy had never accepted
any constraints on conduct, he never had any qualms about extending the
freedoms he enjoyed to others.'
Likewise, Fox's brand of Whiggery, which turned this descendant of Charles
II into the most strenuous opponent of executive power, was the expression
of a certain sort of personality rather than the result of deep reading in
political science. He never seriously believed in extending the franchise,
in natural rights or even the virtues of a mixed constitution. To his
opponents, the phalanx of grand Whiggery who bore his coffin - Devonshire,
Norfolk, Carlisle, Albemarle, Fitzwilliam - represented the 'Aristocratical
Republic' which Fox would have substituted for Britain's system of limited
Monarchy.
He was probably right about the needlessness of the war with America but
wrong about France - until, that is, he encountered the megalomania of
Napoleon face-to-face in Paris in 1802 ('Long talk with Bony he talked
almost all'). In later life (to the disappointment of his parliamentary
allies) he virtually retired from the political arena, returning to
literature ('in every point of view a preferable occupation to politics'),
to history (he began a history of the reign of James II), and to the haven
of a late but contented marriage, all of which prompted his niece to remark
that 'he affects to be as virulent as ever in politicks, but as he sometimes
laughs at his want of candour, I think it is more a love of argument &amp;
dispute than any fixed principle to him.' He died, to universal mourning, in
1806 aged 56.
Mitchell wisely refuses to smooth a career full of ambiguities and
hesitations into a tale of undeviating consistency. He traces its
fluctuations with great subtlety. The result, quite simply, is one of this
year's best books, a brilliantly readable achievement.

OUTERBRIDGE REACH by Robert Stone Andre Deutsch Pounds 14.99, 409 pages
BRIGHTNESS FALLS by Jay McInerney Bloomsbury Pounds 15.99, 415 pages
ROBERT Stone made his reputation as a writer with a deft touch for
profundity, a novelist who could plumb the depths of the American psyche
from within the confines of a clean, well-paced narrative. Whether he was
examining right-wing politics in Hall of Mirrors or the after-effects of the
Vietnam War in Dog Soldiers, Stone kept the reader close with a style as
likely to crackle with gunfire as with ideas.
Outerbridge Reach displays Stone's characteristic willingness to plunge in
at the deep end. Based loosely on a true story, his fifth novel details the
attempt by Owen Browne, a former naval officer and Vietnam veteran, to sail
solo around the world in a big race. Browne is a gung-ho, all-American guy
who lives comfortably with teenage daughter and white bread wife, making an
easy living working for a yacht company. But his landlocked security is not
as gratifying as it first seems, and when the opportunity to enter the
competition pops up, Browne jumps at it, seeing the challenge as a way of
confronting the demons he has been avoiding since the war.
His preparatory efforts for the long voyage are recorded by Strickland, a
cynical documentary maker who becomes intimately involved with Browne's wife
after the sailor casts off. Meanwhile, back at sea, Browne's worst fears
about his own competence surface, particularly when it becomes apparent that
his boat is a dud. So he holes up on a forsaken Antarctic island and begins
to fake his progress reports back to the race headquarters, perpetrating a
deception to match the lie his life has been.
It is easy to see what attracted Stone to this story, so ripe with
opportunity for examining the nature of heroism and self-deception. You can
certainly make a case for the book being a thorough examination of the sort
of soul that swallowed the American Dream whole only to have it come back
up, like a swell of seasickness, as something nightmarish. But, unlike in
his early work, the author fails to find the narrative drive needed to power
his ideas along, relying on awkward plot devices such as Biblical passages
overheard on a radio. The result is a top-heavy book that founders under its
own profundity.
Jay McInerney's Brightness Falls suffers from just the opposite difficulty,
sacrificing any sort of real insight for the sake of a boisterous narrative.
Russell and Corrine are an amiable yuppie couple riding the crest of the
prosperous mid-1980s wave through hip Manhattan. Russell is a flash book
editor, while Corrine works with noble reluctance as a stockbroker. Their
marriage is an oasis in the city's emotional desert, secretly envied by
single friends. Russell soon falls prey to the giddiness of the times,
however, launching a hostile takeover bid for his firm in order to gain more
editorial clout. Gradually, hubris eats away at the couple, threatening
their marriage as things start to go disastrously wrong in the days leading
up to the Crash of 1987.
There's no doubt that McInerney has fashioned a good read here, but at what
expense? He seems so eager to please that he has milked his book of nuance
and originality. Everything seems designed to strike the reader as familiar
 -voracious female stockbrokers wolf down meat and chomp cigars, rich
businessmen are referred to as 'moguls', models are stupid, writers wacky
and difficult. Drugs, the homeless, AIDS and eating disorders all make
appearances, yet are dealt with in a perfunctory way. (Corrine's concern for
the dispossessed in her neighbourhood is so pathetic I kept hoping it was
intended as satire, though I fear it wasn't)
This is less an examination of the 1980 than a skilful rehashing of accepted
wisdom on the era, a wink and a nod to its truisms, as if Vanity Fair
magazine has already figured everything out and it is now up to the novelist
just to give it some juice. Robert Stone may founder in the depths of our
era, but McInerney, like some souped-up speed boat, glides fast and free
over its surface, a mile wide, an inch deep.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Property: Perchance to dream - Audrey Powell goes to Florida
to meet a British builder
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By AUDREY POWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A BRITON has been picked to build the 1993 Florida Dream home: 32-year-old
Mark Wilson, from Birmingham, whose housebuilding company, London Bay Homes,
based in Fort Myers, Florida, specialises in custom-built properties.
The Dream Home project is not a competition but an invitation. The primary
sponsor is Home &amp; Condo magazine, which keeps a close watch on housebuilding
in south west Florida, shortlisting companies which it rates highest; it was
from this list that the choice was made. Other contributors to the project -
architect, landscaper, furnishing and marketing companies - have been
selected in the same way; they form the Dream team.
The house will be built at Quail West, a new golf course development in
Naples, Florida, and unveiled in February 1993.
Home &amp; Condo first decided in 1989 to explore the question 'what makes a
house a dream home?' Many new properties incorporate some 'dream' elements -
but what if the best architects and builders got together, listened to a
panel of consumers, and built a dream home from scratch? What if money were
not a primary consideration? What amenities and technology would be
featured? Home &amp; Condo felt this could provide a useful lesson in consumer
preferences for builders throughout the US. So it gathered a 'focus group'
of consumers - some nationally known experts and sophisticated second-time
homebuyers - to gather data. From this, a team produced the first Florida
Dream Home in 1990.
The magazine is now repeating the exercise with its 1993 Florida Dream Home,
using a new focus group, a new team, 'and a new set of dreams.' The 1993
Home will reflect the changing values of today's upscale consumer, it says.
The setting is a 530 acre section of Quail West, where density averages one
home to three acres. The house is being built on a one-acre site with a view
of the lake and the first tee of the golf course. The low-built, five
bedroom, five bathroom, 6,400 sq ft property (about six times the size of an
average British estate house) will cost Pounds 800,000.
Architect Donald Evans, whose practice is part of the team, says: 'If you
were to label the house as to style, it would clearly be a Euro design' -
meaning brick, arches, columns and wrought iron.
Team manager Mark Wilson stresses that 'Naples is a fairly traditional place
 -it is not Miami'. So the exterior of the house must not be outlandish,
while the interior will be 'highly modern but completely livable-in.' But
then Wilson has to sell the house - each team member is responsible for the
cost of his or her own product until the property is sold, with marketing
costs shared between them.
Once built, the property will remain a 'showcase home' - furnished as a show
house, but used for functions and thus open to the public - for up to a
year. It will then be sold. If bought earlier, it will be leased back by the
builder.
The house is a widely-spread design, mostly at ground level. Cars drop
passengers under a broad portico. You enter a foyer with 14 ft ceilings.
There is much glass-walling, with views of the lake, golf course or swimming
pool, emphasising Florida's indoor/outdoor life.
There is a 'brain' room (obligatory for today's progressive home) housing
computers and other high-tech toys. The computerised home management system
will integrate heating, air-conditioning, lighting, security and garden
irrigation. Pressing a button will create different lighting patterns in
rooms. Pressing another in the master bedroom turns off all lights in the
house (which may not be popular with someone reading elsewhere).
One room forms a private theatre. There are various indoor and outside
entertaining rooms, and the house is scattered with subspaces, like a
'flashback' to the butler's pantry. Two double garages stand in separate
courtyards, with one for teenagers' and guests' cars. The other, presumably,
is for keeping parental cars in safety. A lake surrounds the swimming pool,
with pool water flowing down into it. Viewed from the house, it appears as
an unbroken body of water.
Mark Wilson's father was a quantity surveyor with George Wimpey, the British
contractor; he later started his own housebuilding and construction company
in Sutton Coldfield, near Birmingham. The Wilson Group had an Pounds 85m
annual turnover by the late 1980s.
Mark was trained in the building world; eight years ago he went to the US to
expand the commercial side of the family's business. After considerable
research he decided that south west Florida offered good investment value
and growth potential. In 1990 he formed his own housebuilding company there.
He aims to keep to the exclusive market, with a limited number of
design/build contracts per year: 3,500 sq ft to 13,000 sq ft homes in the
area's smartest beachfront, golfing or yachting communities.
'The first two years were tough,' Wilson admits of his early time in the US,
although he feels that starting a company from the ground up was 'an
experience invaluable for any businessman.'
'We originally found a very fragmented market, with no one dominant company.
Many were 'mom and pop' operations. We believed that by incorporating a
formal business approach to housebuilding, with financial structuring,
strategic marketing, quality control of construction and proper
communication with our clients, we would separate ourselves from the pack.'
Wilson thinks it takes a good five years fully to understand the US market
and to take advantage of the opportunities. 'It is easy to assume that
because we speak (almost) the same language, doing business is the same as
in the UK. Unfortunately that is not true.'
The markets are very different, and without a full time on-the-ground
commitment it is very difficult to turn a profit in the US, he says. 'We
never question the importance of real estate lawyers in England throughout
the development process, but in America you may well need a team of them,
each with a different speciality.'
Wilson also found the banking climate totally different. 'In our early years
we shopped for bankers for each deal and relationships seemed to matter very
little. With the current real estate recession and credit crunch things are
changing and I predict that relationships will become very important. Who
knows, it may end up more like England, where one keeps a banking
relationship for years.'

FT  06 JUN 92 / Property: American homes with plenty of horse sense / Taking
a canter through Kentucky's blue grass country
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENTUCKY is famous for its Derby, its bourbon and its wide open countryside,
yet about half of its 3.6m residents live in urban areas. Many are quick to
proclaim with pride that they are within a day's drive of 70 per cent of the
US population.
The Kentucky Derby is the high-point of the year, but it is not only
thoroughbreds that are held in high esteem; Arabs, trotters, quarter horses
and plain, honest-to-goodness Dobbins are cosseted and cared for by doting
owners.
About 35 miles north east of Churchill Downs, where the famous race is run,
a Miami developer named Alec Courtelis has indulged his passion for
'Arabians,' as they call them in Kentucky, by acquiring 5,400 acres of
farmland which should become the centre of the equine universe. He calls it
L'Esprit. It is close to a town called LaGrange, where trains still run
along the main street.
This is the famous 'blue grass' area, so-called because of the tiny blue
flower that colours the grass in early spring. There must be a few blue
chips around here too, for Arab stallions such as Alladin, in the Lasma
centre, the horse-breeding holy of holies, are valued at up to Dollars 20m
(Pounds 11.1m).
The estate is immaculate; 'Dollars 500 fine for littering' proclaims a sign
on the approach road. Even the flowers and brilliant white dogwood seem to
know their place. Some 11 miles of new roads wind through the 70 designated
plots, 123 miles of neat black three and four rail fences surround
well-tended paddocks. (Lucky the man with the creosote contract here.)
L'Esprit is a good place to rear and train horses; it is also one of the
best places to raise a family or to retire - school buses deliver their
charges right to the front gate. In a national survey, the Association of
Retired Persons put this corner of Kentucky among the top places for quality
of life (little crime, plenty of culture, low cost of living).
The 70 plots on L'Esprit vary in size from 10 to 700 acres - they call them
'horse farms' out here. All planning consents have been obtained and all the
'farms' have direct access on to a network of 25 miles of bridleway which
wind through woodland - and past 88 ponds, providing plenty of water for the
paddocks.
Prices of plots in the current phase are between Dollars 80,000 and Dollars
375,000. Building costs, according to the London agents, Pearsons, are about
Dollars 70 a square foot. Thus, a substantial house with swimming pool could
be built for about Dollars 150,000 (Pounds 83,300).
Often the Georgian and colonial style houses appear prosaic beside the grand
homes of the horses: high, black-roofed barns capped with spires and cupolas
to draw fresh air through the building are embellished with arches and
decorative windows.
Although Kentucky has suffered less than most states in the recession,
progress at L'Esprit has not been rapid, and several of the farms are now on
the market. The immense sale ring and facilities are in place, and very
grand they are too, but the training centre, steeplechase track and country
club have still to be built. However, the developer can point to Dollars 30m
'up front' commitment already.
Interest is coming now from beyond the shores of the US, with several buyers
coming from Europe and Canada. Kentucky-born Steven Cauthen, who won the
Derby 14 years ago, is advising the developers.
Buying procedures are simple and inexpensive. Legal costs amount to about
Dollars 5,000. When selling, the local estate agent (realtor) will charge
between 6 and 10 per cent. Annual outgoings include real estate tax (about
Dollars 2 per Dollars 1,000 dollar value) plus local home tax and a charge
of about Dollars 18 a month for garbage collection.
European marketing, by Pearsons of Dover Street, London, will include
promotion at many of Europe's top race meetings this summer, including
today's Oaks, at Epsom, next week's French Oaks at Chantilly and the Irish
Derby at The Curragh.

IT HAD to come. Now that cotton is chic, that simple weaves and checks and
stripes are what the furnishing mood is all about, a shop devoted to nothing
but sturdy, honest, cotton fabrics could not be far away.
Thomas Dare opened last week at 341 Kings Road, London SW3 5ES (tel:
071-351-7991) with a splendid Sasha Waddell-designed interior filled with
bolts of 100 per cent cotton furnishing fabrics, all grouped in colour
'families' with not an overblown rose, a cherub or delicate garland in
sight.
The collection was designed in New England by the Daphne Tyson Company, but
the fabrics are woven, to an evidently very high standard, in India. For the
home decorator what the shop offers is well-priced fabrics (which these days
means prices between Pounds 13.95 and Pounds 20.95 a metre) and a vast
choice of colour-linked fabrics.
Every plain cotton rep will have a selection of checks and plaids of all
sizes, stripes and spots, which all work together. There is a also large
collection of furnishing trimmings - everything from twisted two-colour
ropes to tassels, ties braids and trims, all of which tie in with the
fabrics. Getting a colour-scheme together could hardly be made easier.
Colours range from dark and sombre browns and maroons, through pale neutrals
and on to the zingy primaries and pretty pastels. The collection may sound
simple and artless, based as it is on nothing but cotton, but many of the
colours and the colour combinations give plenty of scope for considerable
sophistication.
The fabrics are displayed in a range of Sasha Waddell's furniture - linen
presses, tallboys, sofas (photographed above), chairs and the like. and
Although examples in the shop are part of the fixtures and fittings any of
the pieces can be ordered.

FT  06 JUN 92 / How To Spend It: They will steal the shirt off your back / A
look at clothing which has achieved cult status among the cognoscenti
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
TELEVISION news presenters wear them, Jodie Foster wore a green one in
Little Man Tate, Catherine Deneuve buys them by the dozen, Kylie Minogue is
an addict, Dustin Hoffman picks up a couple whenever he is in London, my
children give them to each other for Christmas and birthdays, fashion lovers
collect them. What are they? Equipment shirts.
It is hard to explain their special appeal to those who have yet to become
hooked.
The first one I bought was about six years ago in a cut-price shop in the
Rue St Dominique in Paris - I had never heard the Equipment brand name but
fell for the fine quality cotton and the simplicity of the cut  - which
added up to that elusive garment, the perfect, simple, white cotton shirt.
Somebody else thought so, too, because I no longer own it and I still miss
it. I am not too sure who took it but suspect our last successful burglar is
even now cutting a dash in it somewhere in north Kensington. (Burglars
around Kensington way seem to be discerning label freaks - my husband once
disturbed one who ran off leaving a bag ready-packed with every garment with
a distinguished label that I owned. Joseph, Plantation, YSL, Kenzo, Betty
Jackson were in the bag. Marks &amp; Spencer, Benetton, Jaeger and the lower
orders languished on the shelves.)
The classic, most sought-after of the Equipment shirts is the silk version,
the 1501. It is to the shirt what the 501 is to jeans, the 2CV to cars, the
Montblanc to pens. In other words it has joined the exclusive club of cult
objects. So much so, that our best-known chain-store has some remarkably
similar looking shirts in a small range of colours on sale at Pounds 49.95
although for the cult-worshipper nothing but the real thing will do.
They come in some 35 different colours, everything from creamy white to
black with something like five different shades of pink through to fuschia.
The cut could hardly be simpler - it is as close as possible a reworking of
a shirt that Christian Restoin (inexplicably always known as Sisley), the
man behind the label, saw Burt Lancaster wearing in the film Desert Fury. He
has never made anything else, never been tempted to elaborate - he has just
stuck to shirts, shirts and nothing but shirts.
The particular appeal seems to lie in a combination of the quality of the
silk - thick and heavy as cream - the simplicity and generosity of the cut,
the two ample pockets, the collar attached directly, without a neckband, to
the shirt body, the carefully colour-matched buttons. The shirts are worn by
men and women and come in four sizes - small, medium, large and extra large.
They are all one price - Pounds 119.
Although the 1501 is the real aficionado's shirt, there is asmall cotton
collection - always a white one (Pounds 65), a few stripes and checks, some
short-sleeved, some long.
Until now the shirts have been available from Joseph, 77 Fulham Road, London
SW3 and from Harvey Nichols, Knightsbridge, London SW1 but, on June 8,
builders permitting, Joseph Ettedgui is opening a small shop devoted to
nothing but Equipment shirts at 21 Sloane Street, London SW1. He aims to
make sure that Equipment fans can be sure of finding the shirts in all the
colours and all the sizes.
One last thing - wear them with a couple of buttons undone or buttoned to
the neck but, please, never with a tie.

ANYONE who has taken an interest in costume jewellery will know the name of
Fulco de Vedura, the Sicilian duke, who, forced to earn his own living, came
to make jewellery that was as significant in its day as Chanel's clothes and
Lalique's glass.
He was lucky in his meeting with Chanel. Their tastes meshed perfectly. Both
loved splendour but loathed vulgarity. They despised the prevalent fashion
of putting huge diamonds in platinum settings ('One might just as well tie a
cheque around one's neck'). Verdura began designing great, colourful
Byzantine pieces that looked wonderful against the lean simplicity of her
jerseys and little dresses.
Between them they changed not just the look but also the culture of
jewellery. They brought to it a rich medieval splendour as well as wit and
insouciance.
One of the first things he designed for her were the cuff bracelets
embellished with Maltese crosses of multi-coloured stones which she wore
constantly.
The company he founded in New York, Verdura, is still going strong, (though
it was bought by E L Landrigan in 1985) and still making authentic copies of
many original pieces.
From June 8-16 there is a rare chance to see - and, if your cheque book is
accommodating enough, buy - some original Verdura pieces as well as modern
reproductions at 4 Ryder Street, St James's London SW1. Photographed, right
, are copies of Chanel's famous cuff bracelets. Made from cocholong
embellished with citrine, amethyst, rubies, diamonds and pearls they are
Dollars 15,000 (Pounds 8,333.30) a piece.
Though prices of the pieces are high (from Pounds 1,000 to thousands) the
exhibition is filled with visual delight - you do not need to spend a penny
to enjoy it.

A READER rang me this week. She had looked everywhere for plain,
old-fashioned wooden doorknobs and been unable to find them.
Her request seemed as innocently simple as AA Milne's 'Could we have some
butter for the royal slice of bread?' but just as mysteriously difficult to
deal with.
Knobs &amp; Knockers was one company which I suggested. No, she had tried it and
it was unable to help. John Lewis, the department store? Well, it had some
in pale wood, not what she had in mind. And so on - until I hit upon
consulting The Ideal Home Design Sourcebook by Barbara Chandler.
There, tucked away in chapter eight, was everything one needed to know about
doors and door furniture. A single telephone call to Comyn Ching, 19 Shelton
Street, London (tel:071-379-3026) listed as just one of the sources but
chosen because of its reputation, revealed that it did 'just four styles . .
. including some old ones.'
All this is just to illustrate what an immensely useful directory The Ideal
Home Design Sourcebook is. Anyone who has ever done up a house knows that
the ardent restorer always gets notions, some sensible, some quirky, about
what is required to bring the house to life. Some are easily found, some
take days of tracking down. Whatever you have in mind the book should help.
Whether you are looking for blue glass cellars for antique salt and pepper
holders, for non-slip underlay for rugs, for a pair of precious wrought-iron
gates, old timber to do up a country cottage or plain built-in cupboards,
this book should help make it easier.
It seems to cover almost everything the new home-owner or restorer could
want - from new sources of brand-new fitments and furniture, to craftspeople
who will make to special commission. There are arcane specialists, dyers,
gilders, conservationists, thatchers and framers.
I can see this book saving most of us hours on the telephone. The addresses
have been acquired and collated during Barbara Chandler's years as a
journalist in the home interiors and design field. For just Pounds 9.95 you
buy access to a journalist's most precious possession - her contacts book.
The book can be bought from branches of Waterstone. Call, or ring
081-503-0589 and quote your credit card number. It is obtainable by mail
from: Calmann King, PO Box 666, London E15 1DW. Send a cheque for Pounds
9.95 made out to Calmann King.

FT  06 JUN 92 / 'Our Lady' gives up her golden secret - Robin Eggars meets
Herbert Humphreys, a man for whom treasure hunting has become a lifelong
quest that reeks of history, adventure and potentially priceless rewards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN EGGARS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE starless and stormy night of January 4 1656, the Nuestra Senora de
las Maravillas - Our Lady of the Marvels - fired a cannon shot to warn the
rest of its flotilla of approaching sandbanks off the Little Bahama Bank. In
the confusion that followed, the Spanish treasure galleon was rammed by its
sister ship, the Concepcion.
According to Don Diego Portichuelo de Rivadeneryra, a priest on board the
Maravillas: 'The Concepcion gave such a blow to our boom with her cutwater,
which had been newly refitted in Havana and made of mahogany, that it broke
in three pieces. That blow broke through our planks from the top of the
waterline to the holds, making splinters of all of them.'
Impaled from port to starboard, wallowing in heavy seas, the Maravillas'
death throes were swift. The 40 tons of gold and silver bullion and
treasure, destined to fund another of King Philip IV's interminable wars
against France, dragged the 150 ft-long ship on to a coral reef. On deck,
priests were mobbed by crewmen eager to make their last confessions. Some
priests demanded gold and jewels as payment, doubtless hoping to survive and
enjoy Heaven on Earth as well as in the hereafter.
The bow of the Maravillas went down in only 30 ft of water but massive waves
ripped the stern - containing most of the treasure - away to sink elsewhere.
Of the 650 people on board, only 45 lived. Those who clung to debris were
swept away by swirling currents. Others grabbed hold of the mast and rigging
that remained above water, but died from exposure and attacks by tiger
sharks. (Tiger sharks guard the wreck to this day.) The avaricious priests
plunged to the bottom, their cassocks weighted down by booty.
As the centuries passed, the shifting sands covered both bones and gold. But
335 years later, in 40 ft of water, a crew member scuba-diving off a salvage
ship, the RV Beacon, uncovered from the sunken bow section a cache of gold
coins and a Spanish colonial gold pectoral cross set with 66 well-matched
emeralds. The cross was auctioned at Christie's in London nine days ago,
where it fetched a record Pounds 231,000.
The cross was the prize piece in a sale of 157 lots salvaged from the
Maravillas, ranging from individual gold and silver coins and bars to
jewellery and even a bronze signal cannon - perhaps the same one that fired
that fateful shot. The sale earned the treasure hunters a total of Pounds
430,000. But the real pay-day could be to come. The Maravillas' manifest
shows it was carrying cargo worth, in present-day terms, more than Dollars
1.6bn - but the real value could be much more, because Spanish sailors
displayed great ingenuity at smuggling.
Thus, now the cross has gone under the auctioneer's hammer, the Beacon's
crew are preparing to search for the mother lode. Legend insists that, in
addition to the bullion, the Maravillas' stern also contained a life-size
statue of the Madonna and Child - weighing more than half a ton and cast
from solid gold - plus a 400 lb gold table studded with emeralds, rubies and
diamonds. If found, their value is incalculable.
Herbert Humphreys, 44, heads Marex, a Memphis-based underwater salvage
company which has been diving on the galleon since 1986. He says the
business of recovering sunken treasure can be 'boring, tedious, expensive
and dangerous.' But he adds: 'It is also one of the most exciting adventures
left on earth. To dive beneath the sea and hold in your hand a weapon, a
coin, a piece of jewellery or a tool that belonged to some unknown and
long-dead man or woman is an experience few people can have. I have seen the
stuff that dreams are made of.'
Humphreys has been hooked on these particular dreams since, aged eight and
playing on a Bahamas beach, he picked up a gold coin washed ashore by the
shifting seas. For his 16th birthday, his father - co-founder of a cooking
oil company which merged, profitably, with the giant Kraft food empire in
1951 - gave him a copy of Fell's Guide to Sunken Treasure Ships of the
World. Written on the title page is the inscription: 'Hope you find Dollars
10m. Love, Dad.' Humphreys still has the well-thumbed book but, these days,
his financial sights are set rather higher.
Indeed, he appears to have inherited a certain financial flair. He had a
private education which gave him all the traditional social graces and charm
of the Southern gentleman, and travelled the world with his parents. After
winning a horse-jumping competition at 16, he invested the Dollars 5,500
prize money in Philippines gold stock at 25 cents a share. He sold it a few
years later at Dollars 30 a share. At 22, he became convinced that the clear
waters off the Cayman Islands would be irresistible to scuba divers. So, he
negotiated a Holiday Inns' franchise for Grand Cayman at a time when there
were only two other small hotels on the island. Now, he has extensive
shipping, air charter and travel businesses in the Caribbean and Memphis.
Humphreys served in Vietnam with the US Navy. He is a qualified pilot and
parachutist who speaks and writes French and Italian. Politically, he is
right wing: he was a major-general in the FDN Legion, a Nicaraguan Contra
organisation.
His first wreck was HMS Thunderer, a British warship which went down off
Honduras in 1780 carrying looted Spanish and French cargo. It was an
archaeological dream untouched for 203 years. Archaeology is the key word,
because Humphreys regards preservation as the first and foremost goal of
treasure recovery. 'Every nail, every little pottery shard, each musket
ball, literally everything we find is treasure to me. We have an artefact
preservationist on board the Beacon who dedicates himself to preserving
these important time capsules of the past. I want to share the results of
our work with the public.' He employs a full-team of marine archaeologists
and researchers and has already given precious metals and 17th century
artefacts to museums in the Caribbean.
Inspired by his success with the Thunderer, he founded Marex (Marine
Archaeological Rescue) in 1984 and persuaded the Bahamian authorities to let
him excavate the Maravillas (they get 25 per cent). Treasure-hunting today
is many microchips away from a rowing boat and a snorkel. The Beacon is
packed with high-tech equipment, giant sand-blowers and metal detectors. It
has been searching the shallow Bahama Bank for the past five summers,
raising Dollars 5m in treasure. The annual operating costs of Dollars
200,000 come from Humphreys' own pocket.
When he is on board, he is the first diver out in the morning and the last
one back at night. Among his own discoveries was a 100.85-carat emerald, the
largest ever discovered from a shipwreck. That stimulated him still further
and now he wants to explore deep-water wrecks. To that end, Marex has just
signed a profit-share deal with the Shirshov Institute of Oceanology which,
since the collapse of the Soviet Union, is in dire need of commercial
funding.
The Russians have two MIRs - three-man submarines which can operate at
depths of nearly 20,000 ft (6,000 metres) - and filmed the Titanic in the
north Atlantic last year. They intend to start operations in the autumn and
their first targets are all in deep international waters: a 22,000-ton
liner, believed to contain 50 boxes of gold, somewhere off Liberia; a World
War Two submarine; and an ancient French wreck off Barbados thought to hold
priceless Ming porcelain, a gift from the Chinese emperor to Louis XIV.
The MIRs will be working 18-hour dives at depths where the water is pitch
black, pressure would make a man implode and the greatest danger to sanity
comes not from claustrophobia but its opposite, agoraphobia, triggered by
being surrounded by vast expanses of open sea. There is plenty of potential
to create a new industry, though. During the war, 10,000 Allied ships were
sunk by enemy action. Their unrecovered cargoes include gold, silver,
jewels, nickel, manganese, tin, copper and aluminium.
Long term, Marex has targeted 23 wrecks with cargo valued at Dollars 500m.
Retrieval costs are estimated at Dollars 35m to Dollars 50m. But while
diving on ships like the Maravillas can be seen as a hobby, albeit an
expensive one, financing deep-water salvage is altogether different.
Although the technology has been available for years, it remains largely
unproven. Investors - who accept cheerfully that it costs Dollars 90m to
repair a satellite in space, or are prepared to risk Dollars 50m financing a
movie that might prove a flop - are wary.
Humphreys is confident of success. But he admits: 'My true love is the old
wrecks because they reek of history, romance and adventure. My personal
interest in this is much more than mere monetary gain. Underwater
treasure-hunting has been my life-long interest and one that I believe to be
the last frontier on this planet.'
He hopes to strike the jackpot with the Maravillas any time now. 'Under the
water, we have found some of the gold bars from the ship marked with the
owners' names, and a trail of gold coins two miles long. We believe that
trail is leading us towards the mother lode. This season, we will find the
stern - and who knows what will be in it.'

FT  06 JUN 92 / Books: Bitten by a midsummer collecting bug - Book fairs /
Preparing for a fairly exhausting time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM ST CLAIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY YEAR the antiquarian and secondhand book trade holds a series of fairs
in London hotels. Although more than half the books sold go to the trade,
the public is also welcome. For the serious collector, mid-June is an
exhausting time. This year you can go from fair to fair nearly every day for
a fortnight with only a short break.
The fairs where the biggest selections of books are to be seen are those run
by the Provincial Booksellers Fairs Association. Originally set up to permit
booksellers outside London a link with wider trade, it has long outlived its
name. In the Edwardian splendour of the Hotel Russell in Russell Square,
Bloomsbury, 240 dealers this year will display 85,000 volumes. There is a
complete change of stock between the two fairs, but buying the catalogue for
the first will let you in to the second.
On two days, association members offer a roadshow where they give advice and
valuation. They accept no legal liability and are not permitted to make
offers, but this is a good opportunity to test whether you really do have an
unnoticed fortune on your shelves.
The books range in price from about Pounds 20 to the thousands. Other fairs
are more uniform in what you can expect. At the 'National' (which is named
after the venue, the Royal National Hotel in Bedford Way, not far from
Russell Square) the emphasis is on secondhand with only a few dealers in
older books. The same goes for the Bonnington, held in the hotel of that
name in Southampton Row off Russell Square, where you will see only a few
volumes old enough to have leather bindings. The 'International', at the
Cafe Royal at the foot of Regent Street, near Piccadilly, is more modest in
size than its name suggests, but you can expect to find some excellent high
quality books there at appropriate prices.
The most expensive books are to be found at the Antiquarian Booksellers
Association fair at the Park Lane hotel which, incidentally, is not in Park
Lane but at the Hyde Park Corner end of Piccadilly. This is an international
event where dealers from many countries offer magnificent illustrated books,
jewelled bindings, fine printing and illuminated manuscripts, as well as
printed books which are important for their words.
A copy of the first (1867) edition of 'Das Kapital' by Karl Marx still costs
Pounds 15,000 in spite of the collapse of all attempts to carry out its
ideas. A set of mimeographed scripts from the Goon shows of the 1950s is on
sale at Pounds 95 each.
The ABA fair is to be opened by satirist John Wells at 6pm during the
preview evening on Tuesday, June 25. The catalogue, which serves as entry
fee, is Pounds 15 that evening but is reduced to Pounds 5 the following
morning.
To celebrate the 150th anniversary of the London Library, about which John
Wells has written an amusing history, the fair has laid on a small
exhibition. One book not for sale is the copy of GH Lewes's Problem of Life
and Mind which a London Library member was reading in 1875 before going into
the Periodicals room and shooting himself.

FT  06 JUN 92 / As they say in Europe: Danes make it tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFERENDUM day dawned bright and cheerful in Copenhagen. Politiken had
written: 'It is satisfying to see that the final part of of the campaign . .
. has been spared national economic horror images.' It concluded: 'The
reaction of Danish and foreign investors (to a rejection) would be bound to
be negative but it is not possible to put a figure on how serious that would
be.' Nobody has since tried.
In fact, trying to work out what it all meant for Denmark was the least of
anybody's concerns. The Neue Osnabrucker Zeitung had little time for its
neighbours: 'It was not a victory for common sense, the outcome was all
emotion. The underlying worries about loss of sovereignty and identity in
the community, as well as reservations about the excessive power of a
reunited Germany, may have contributed. It was a triumph of the past, a
denial of the future.'
(The paper had used almost the same words two days earlier about the
unveiling of the memorial to the RAF's 'Bomber' Harris in London last
Sunday: 'There remains the bitter recognition that, on that island,
backward-looking attitudes rule, that the sensitivities of a closely-allied
country are not taken into account.' Curiously, the Harris statue was
erected at the church of St Clement Danes; it was a tough week for the
Germans).
The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung gave the nearest thing to an official
view: 'Much of the criticism of Brussels 'Eurocrats' is cheap and wrong:
compared with a German city, the commission is not overstaffed. Whoever sees
a 'super-government' on the horizon overlooks the fact that Brussels can
make only recommendations and it is the council of ministers that decides.'
In France, reaction was mixed. La Presse de la Manche, published beside the
Channel, sounded like the British: 'This is a bad way to build Europe. It
should evolve . . . But it cannot be done against the will of the people . .
. between the Yes of the English who, since ratification, have put
themselves out of the game, and the Danish No, there has to be a humble
reaction on the part of European tribunes.'
The Paris papers were caught leading on their now irrelevant parliamentary
debate on the ratification of the Maastricht treaty. But Liberation was
quick on its feet: 'The Danish rejection, even by a small majority, takes in
effect the form of a warning to the architects of this community which
remains, for most of its inhabitants, a technocratic construction, far from
daily pre-occupations.'
The Dutch have much in common with the Danes: both inhabit flat lands, speak
unlovely tongues, share a taste for second-rate cheese and are overrun with
pigsties. So, it was a surprise to find a hitherto unsuspected streak of
Danophobia in NRC-Handelsblad, which complained that the Danes had let
everybody down: 'The great aim of a powerful jump towards a federal Europe
desired above all by the Netherlands has failed . . . United Europe has
fallen into this state because of the relatively small but determined elite
that is Denmark.'
The Irish Times wondered whether an Irish referendum would go the same way:
'Parallels between the two states must now be subjected to more critical
scrutiny than ever before. It is a crude argument but, nonetheless, Ireland
does stand to gain more financially than does Denmark from Europe's new
direction . . . Ireland is a poorer state and, in a converging Europe, hopes
to raise its living standards, whereas Danes fear a fall.' Ireland, it
added, had weaned itself from dependence on its big neighbour while Denmark
feared the growing influence of its neighbour.
La Repubblica's correspondent in Copenhagen alone refused to reflect on what
it meant for his home country, partly because nobody could possibly know
what anything means for Italy. But he thought the result was good for the
British: 'John Major, in the next few months of the presidency of the EC,
will find precious allies among the men of Copenhagen in the struggle
against the centralism of the community bureaucracy and against any federal
tendencies.'
Shakespeare gave the Danes a prince who could not make up his mind, and who
has provided every nation and each new generation with food for thought as a
result. The Danes have voted twice for 'Europe' and once against. European
papers turned this week's split vote into an occasion to reflect upon
themselves, which meant each has come up with a different view of Danish
reality. One might ask the Danes what they think, if ever they could give a
straight answer.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Cookery: Fishy feasts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIPPA DAVENPORT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUCKING thoughtfully on his pipe, Harold Wilson opined memorably in 1962:
'If I had the choice between smoked salmon and tinned salmon, I'd have it
tinned. With vinegar.' It was, I suppose, what is now called a politically
correct statement.
Those who do not share his views often choose smoked salmon for winter
celebrations and they see spring and summer as the time when fresh salmon is
king.
Fisherfolk, like those who shoot, sometimes feel there is such a thing as
too much game, the charm of it lying more in the sport than at table. For
the rest of us wild salmon remains a special food - and the price of the
farmed version is undeniably attractive.
The festive associations of salmon were well illustrated recently at the
Savoy Grill where diners were treated to a revival of menus from the 1950s,
when le saumon au champagne was a favourite dish.
To make this fishy feast, a salmon is first cut down the backbone, opened
out so that the flesh is clearly seen, and the bones are removed leaving the
head and tail intact. The fish is then lightly poached and quenelles of
salmon and turned mushrooms are laid, alternately, down its length. Finally,
the whole thing is napped with champagne sauce and decorated with egg and
crumbed goujons of sole and fleurons of puff pastry.
A tour de force, I will tuck into it willingly at the kind invitation of a
chef, but it is not the sort of dish I would dream of making myself.
Home cooks now feel more at ease with recipes that boast less cream, less
napping and less fanciful touches. Cleaner cut flavours are favoured, time
is at a premium and practicality is an admired trait.
To unzip mini tins of red salmon and serve one to each of your guests with a
communal bottle of malt vinegar to shake over the fish would certainly be
simple, but too crude. The more moderate line of the recipes that follow
seems better suited to the 1990s.
The second recipe is my own. The first comes from The Salmon Cookbook by
Tessa Hayward (to be published on June 18 by Ebury Press at Pounds 16.99) a
volume of recipes old and new for all occasions prefaced by notably thorough
coverage of salmon basics.
Hayward's practice of spelling out everything in great detail will delight
novice and nervous cooks. Those blessed with a good fishmonger may never
need to gut, scale, skin, cut fillets, steaks and escalopes for themselves
but reading and seeing how these things are done helps the cook understand
the structure of the fish.
CARPACCIO OF SALMON (serves 4)
This admirably simple first course dish comes from Tessa Hayward's new book.
She describes it as another form of ceviche but differently flavoured and
the fish is cut into escalopes (smoked salmon-like slices) so that the
citrus juice penetrates and 'cooks' it with great speed.
8-10 oz salmon fillet;  1/2 - 3/4 inch piece of ginger root; the finely
grated zest of 1 lime and the juice of 2 limes; 1 tsp sugar;  1/4 pt olive
oil; 1 tbsp balsamic vinegar.
Peel and finely chop the ginger and put it into a small pan with the lime
zest, sugar and 2 fl oz water. Simmer until the liquid is reduced by half.
Pour it into a bowl. Mix in the oil and vinegar, salt and pepper, and set
aside.
Cut the salmon fillet into very thin slices. Unless you are a real whizz at
cutting, you will then need to put each slice between a double layer of
greasproof paper and beat it out gently with a rolling pin.
Transfer the slices to four plates: the easiest way to do this may be to
remove the top layer of greaseproof paper, invert the salmon onto a plate,
then peel away the second layer of paper.
When all four plates are prepared, brush the lime juice over the fish. Leave
for 15 minutes so the salmon softens and turns light pink. Whisk up and pour
on the dressing, and serve with brown bread and butter.
SALMON WITH COURGETTES, CORIANDER &amp; LIME (serves 2)
If you have a large shallow pan this agreeably speedy recipe can be doubled
to serve four, but I find it especially useful for busy midweek evenings.
2 salmon tail fillets weighing 4-5 oz each; 6-8 oz courgettes;  1/4 pt fish
stock; half a large juicy lime; 1 generously heaped tablespoon chopped fresh
coriander leaves;1-1 1/2 oz butter.
Slice the courgettes and chop the herbs. Grate the zest from the lime and
squeeze the juice. Season the fish with sea salt and black pepper.
Bring the stock and lime juice to simmering point in a 10 inch saute pan.
Add the courgettes, spreading them in a single layer if possible, and
sprinkle the citrus zest over.
Bring back to a simmer then lay the salmon fillets side by side, skin side
down, on the bed of vegetables. They will stand proud of the liquid, cooking
mainly in the rising steam. Cover and cook over moderate heat for just 3-4
minutes until tender and succulent.
Lift out the solids and keep them warm. Turn the heat up under the pan, add
the coriander to the bubbling liquid and whisk in the butter to enrich the
sauce and make it syrupy. Check seasoning, pour the sauce over the fish and
serve.
Cookery courses: Last week we omitted the list of locations where Sonia
Stevenson's sauce and fish courses are scheduled during the next few months.
A few places are still available on courses due to take place in:
Twickenham, Middlesex; Cullompton, Devon; Blackheath, Kent; Warwick, and
Inverness. Fixtures for Glasgow and elsewhere are in the pipeline. Contact
Mrs Stevenson for details: 7 Lynn Court, Mitcham Lane, London SW16 6LL
(081-677-1172).

FT  06 JUN 92 / Wine: And you can quote me on the wine . . . - Jancis
Robinson with some pithy comments from the wine world
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANCIS ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPPE Hernandez of the major Bordeaux negociant SDVF on relative values
in red bordeaux: 'The crus classes are simply too expensive. If you taste
blind one of the many really excellent crus bourgeois against a cru classe,
there is much less of a difference than in the old days. You will have to
pay four or five times more for the cru classe, but it certainly won't taste
four or five times better.'
Chateaux currently outperforming their bourgeois status are Angludet, Beau
Site, Chasse Spleen, Citran, Gloria, Haut-Marbuzet, Lilian-Ladouys, Meyney,
Monbrison, Ormes-de-Pez, Pibran, Potensac, Sociando-Mallet, La Tour de By,
Tour Haut-Caussan and Verdignan. British claret specialists include Adnams
(Tour Haut Caussan 1989 Pounds 8.20); Bute Wines of the Isle of Bute tel:
0700-502730 (La Tour de By 1985 Pounds 8.03); Davisons shops in London and
the Home Counties (Beau Site 1986 at Pounds 8.45); Hungerford Wine Co of
Berkshire (one of the few to make a serious offer of 1991s, including
Lilian-Ladouys); Justerini &amp; Brooks of London SW1 and Edinburgh (wide
range); Lay &amp; Wheeler of Colchester (Chasse-Spleen most vintages and the
lovely Angludet 1990 at Pounds 86 a case ex-cellars); and Peatlings of East
Anglia and London EC1 (La Tour de By 1986 at Pounds 7.85).
Angelo Gaja, who makes Italy's most expensive wines, on the Veneto fungicide
debacle: 'Britain was the main country affected, because the British buy
such cheap wine.'
Britons could prove otherwise by lashing out on Gaja's stunning Gaia &amp; Rey
Chardonnay 1988, a mere Pounds 31 a bottle from Valvona &amp; Crolla of
Edinburgh. A determined iconoclast, he spurns barrel fermentation as too
much of a good thing and is proud of having increased yields slightly, to 38
hectolitres per hectare, claiming this results in less alcoholic and better
balanced wines. His dream is to make great Riesling 'because it, not
Sauvignon, is the great challenger to Chardonnay'.
Dirk Richter, of the Mosel estate Max Ferd Richter, on what might have been:
'I carefully left half a hectare of grapes on the vine to make a 1991
Eiswein, but one December night every single one was eaten by 17 wild boar -
even though the vineyard is right next to the village.' The year 1990 is one
of acidity, unusually high acid plus ripeness. Drink 1989s, then 1988s, then
1990s which may well gain the same fame as the 1921s eventually.'
His Brauneberg Juffer Riesling Kabinett 1990 (about Pounds 6.75 from
Bibendum of London NW1 and Summerlee Wines of Earls Barton (0604-810488). It
is in retreat at the moment but is worth buying by the case to provide a
really revitalising aperitif over the next two, yes two, decades.
Annegret Reh-Gartner, of Reichsgraf von Kesselstatt, a Mosel house being put
aggressively in order, on the super-ripe 1990 vintage: 'To satisfy demand in
the German market where a Kabinett sells out in a year but a (riper) Auslese
takes five years to sell, we had to downgrade lots of Spatlese to Kabinett
and Auslese to Spatlese. But the downgrading was too extreme. We have spoilt
our customers.'
Von Kesselstatt's impressive Josephshofer Kabinett Trocken 1990 was actually
downgraded two categories, from Auslese to Kabinett, but because it has the
dreaded word Trocken (dry) on the label, von Kesselstatt's importers O W
Loeb of London SE1 won't even think of importing it. What a shame that a few
poor early specimens spoilt the reputation of Germany's drier Trocken and
Halbtrocken wines abroad. Nowadays the Germans won't drink anything else -
but the joke is that most good producers in Germany are tending to make
their wines drier in all categories anyway, often simply omitting the T-word
on the label for export markets. Other stockists of von Kesselstatt's 1990s
include Waverly Vintners in Scotland, Berry Bros &amp; Rudd of London SW1 and
The Wine Society of Stevenage.
Michel Juillot, peasant king of Mercurey on oenology (the science of
winemaking) :'Oenology is the motorway. You get there fast but you eat badly
en route. Me, I prefer to take the back roads and to stop at little country
inns on the way.'
His Mercureys, both red and white, are a revelation and deserve to be kept
far longer than most (his 1985 whites are just reaching top form now). Buy
them from Domaine Direct of London EC1 (071-837-1142) for Pounds 7-Pounds 12
a bottle, tasting like wines costing twice as much.
Roger Piquet of Chateaux du Languedoc, a group of truly quality-conscious
producers committed to the long-scorned Midi wine scene for the long term,
on a sea-change of opinion in France: 'Since February or so we've seen
people discover just what good things there are here. They do comparative
tastings with, say, a Macon Blanc and a Bordeaux petit chateau and see what
value we can offer. We're benefitting from the French consumers' rebellion
at the high prices charged in Bordeaux, Burgundy and Beaujolais.'
And no wonder. Even the Chateaux of the Languedoc are able to offer
seriously well-made wines in the crucial Pounds 3.50-Pounds 4.50 bracket.
Piquet's suave red Minervois Chateau de Gourgazaud 1989 is Pounds 3.55 at
Sainsbury's. Even denser and more dramatic reds come from fellow-member in
the Corbieres, Chateau de Lastours whose Cuvee Simone Descamps is well worth
Pounds 4.99 a bottle from Peter Dominic, Bottoms Up, Wine Rack and Thresher
Wine Shops. Blends of interesting grape varieties such as Viognier, Syrah
and Mourvedre from the historic Abbaye de Valmagne are sold for little more
than Pounds 4 by Eldridge Pope, of Dorchester, and its associated Reynier
Wine Library shops in London EC3 and SW1. Domaine de Raissac's particularly
good Syrah 1990 and Merlot 1991 can be had from Haughton Fine Wines of
Chorley, Cheshire.
Other exciting single varietals from Chateau de Coussergues are available
from Bordeaux Direct of Reading, while those from the Domaine de Montmarin
next door are sold by Winecellars of London SW18.

about. But there is, too, an element of the superstitious, the awareness
that as it is pithily expressed in proverbs 'pride goeth before
destruction'.
I tend, therefore, to be alert to the risk of provoking Providence. But
every now and then the guard will slip. A small flame of hubris will be lit,
and will burn obstinately awhile. Then, as surely as night follows day,
nemesis arrives and I am returned to a proper condition of humility.
Recent experiences in the West Country illustrated this moral with painful
vividness. A week which began with buoyant hopes and that damnable streak of
conceit ended in humiliation and catastrophe. How bitterly I grieve at that
pride.
To explain it, I have to go back the best part of two decades, to my infancy
as a fly fisherman. I was an utter bungler - my casting was inept, my
knowledge of basic entomology negligible, my ignorance of technnique
absolute. Over four or five years I tried to correct these failings on
annual expeditions to fish those gorgeous Exmoor streams, the Barle and the
Exe. It was an arduous education.
Two days linger in my memory. On the first I was fishing down the upper
Barle, near Simonsbath. The river here is tiny, and after covering a couple
of miles and catching a few midgets, I decided that there was nothing in it
of worthwhile size (worthwhile in the West Country is four ounces upwards).
I then met two boys, making their way upstream. In their bag they had ten or
so trout averaging six ounces, with a pair of indubitable half pounders. I
gazed dumbly at these beauties, and neglected to ask how they had done it.
The other occasion found me on the Exe, I was, as usual, flogging my way
unthinkingly downstream when a vast hatch of March Browns aroused the trout
to orgiastic feeding. As it happened, I had bought some dry March Browns
that very morning. Cometh the fly, cometh the man, catcheth the trout, I
thought as I tied on the first of an ample stock.
The sequel is painful to dwell on. The architects of my downfall were the
barbed wire fence on top of the bank behind me, and an indecently luxuriant
bush on the far bank in front of me. The flies which were not snapped off on
the wire perished in the bush. The trout feasted while the hatch lasted,
then retired for a good laugh.
I gave the West Country a wide berth, until this Easter. I had, in the
intervening years, acquired a family - so they came too - and, I was
confident, the skill to get even with those trout. This was the seed of my
ruin. In my imagination, I could not stop myself lingering - yes, gloating -
over the baskets of half pounders to come.
I went first to the Barle, to the stretch above Tarr Steps where the river
is half-hidden in steep, ancient woods of sessile oak and hazel. It is
lovely water, although - being a holiday week - its banks were swarming with
picnickers and strollers, accompanied by dogs with a detestable weakness for
flinging themselves into trout-bearing pools. But I cannot really blame them
for my failure; nor the weather, which was ideal; nor the fact that I was
required for family duty in mid-afternoon. I blame myself, for provocative
vanity. In the first promising pool I came to I rose and missed four fish.
For some obscure reason, I then replaced the fly which had aroused this
interest with one that aroused none. I then found I could not remember which
the first fly had been. I tried a dozen possibilities, and a dozen more, and
caught nothing. At last I identified the killing pattern, lost it in a tree
and gave up.
Two days later I fished the Teign, beneath the frowning Luytens
extravaganza, Castle Drogo. By now I had banished fantasies about half
pounders, and was content with the odd fish of two or three ounces which
came my way. The notion that the powers above might have forgotten me had
just crossed my mind when I got caught up in a branch above my head.
I would prefer not to explain how I got the tip of my much-loved Pezon et
Michel rod stuck in my breast pocket as I tried to retrieve the flies.
Suffice it to say that I did, and that I broke the tip of this rare and
beautiful creation, designed by Charles Ritz and bought in Paris years ago.
Numbed, I sat on a tussock and pondered the nature of suffering. I then
began to whip some nylon over the fracture, to effect a temporary repair. In
the middle of this incredibly fiddly Job, an elderly walker came by, looked
at me for a time, and said: 'Good job you have the patience for that'. I
longed to throttle him and throw his corpse in the river. But I had learned
my lesson. 'Yes, it is, isn't it?' I replied - very humbly indeed.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Sport: Injury cloud over Europe's big party - Soccer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BERLIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD Cup is the highlight of the soccer calendar but, for professional
players, an invitation to the European championship is harder to come by.
While 14 European squads of 22 players went to the 1990 World Cup finals,
only eight, of just 20 each, are going to the European tournament which
starts next Wednesday in Sweden when the hosts play France in Stockholm.
Even so, some of Europe's most sought-after celebrities have not been able
to take up their invitations. Britain's two most entertaining midfield
players, Paul Gascoigne of England and Gordon Strachan of Scotland, are
absent injured. So, too, is Lothar Matthaus, captain of West Germany's 1990
World Cup-winning team. England's most talented attacker, the injury-prone
John Barnes, is also out after rupturing his achilles tendon on Wednesday.
The high attrition rate of modern soccer has taken its toll of the lesser
names as well; England have lost a complete back four to injuries. This is
hardly a surprise for a high proportion of Europe's top players are hurt at
any one time, victims of over-crowded fixture lists.
There is little point in complaining, though. The wealthy clubs - which can
make their cash advantage tell by turning every competition into an
endurance race - persuaded UEFA (European soccer's governing body) to double
the number of games in the quarter-finals and semi-finals of the European
Cup last season.
For the stars of this year's European championship, the ultimate prize could
be a lucrative contract from Silvio Berlusconi to turn out for the reserve
team at AC Milan. The club is allowed to field only three non-Italians at a
time in the first team but has six on the books already: the Dutchmen Ruud
Gullit, Frank Rijkaard and Marco van Basten; a Croat, Zvonimir Boban; Dejan
Savicevic, the captain of Yugoslavia; and Giovane Elber, of Brazil.
Berlusconi plans to add France's leading goal-scorer, Jean-Pierre Papin, to
this list.
Neither Boban nor Savicevic will play in Sweden as the political unravelling
of Yugoslavia has also meant the destruction of a promising soccer team. The
Croats, many of the Slovenians and Bosnians and, most recently, the
Macedonian Darko Pancev, had quit already, leaving a squad made up mostly of
Serbs and Montenegrins.
They were thrown out of the championship by UEFA last week and replaced by
Denmark - victims, in a way, of South Africa's referendum on apartheid in
March which proved, beyond any doubt, that sporting boycotts work. Hence the
alacrity with which the United Nations called for one and the immediate
unprotesting compliance from UEFA which, 24 hours before the UN vote, was
pretending it had never heard of Sarajevo.
One man who has overcome injury and will be in Sweden is Gullit, the
greatest European player of the past decade. In his prime, Gullit was like a
sixth-former playing against under-11s: more skilful, bigger, quicker,
stronger. He is proportioned so perfectly that he does not look 6 ft 2 in
until he stands next to a lesser footballer. But, even as he touched the
peaks, his body was beginning to betray him.
In 1988, he was part of the Dutch team that won the European championship,
the Netherlands' first international soccer triumph. In 1989, playing in
pain, he scored twice as Milan dismissed Steuea Bucharest in the European
Cup final.
In 1990, both his teams felt the effects of his injury. He was present, but
less forceful, as Milan retained the European Cup and as the Dutch failed to
repeat their European championship form in the World Cup. Since then, he has
had the cartilages in both knees removed and missed several matches this
spring as the problem flared again. At 30, he is fighting to delay an early
and painful retirement. This could be his last opportuntity for more glory.
While Gullit's powers have waned, those of the two other Milan Dutchmen have
waxed. As the club galloped undefeated to the Italian championship, van
Basten scored a record-breaking 25 goals along the way. Rijkaard was just as
impressive. He has spent much of his career as a defender and brings many of
those qualities to his present role in midfield. He is a reliable rather
than flamboyant passer. His goals - and he scores his share - come from low,
sneaky shots and not with the flourish of van Basten or the power of Gullit.
His speciality is the midfield ambush, pouncing on opponents as they move
the ball out of defence; he thinks and moves faster, while his tackling is
strong and crisp. He exploits this strength and speed on his mazy runs.
Often, he does not trick defenders or blaze past them, he simply powers
through them. If the ball bobbles loose, he reacts more quickly to recover
it.
The Dutch squad offers this trio a supporting cast almost the equal of
Milan's. The pace and goal-scoring ability of Brian Roy will stretch
defences, and the shooting power of Ronald Koeman from free kicks will deter
opponents from resorting to fouls.
But the Dutch also know how to defend with the dullest, as Feyernoord showed
again in this season's Cup Winners' Cup. It is possible that Rinus Michels,
the Dutch coach, will want to compensate for Koeman's slug-like pace by
moving Rijkaard back to mark the speedier opposing strikers, which is the
role he was filling - querulously - when he got into a spitting match with
Germany's Rudy Voller in the World Cup and was sent off.
Rijkaard very much prefers midfield, and the greatest threat to the Dutch
defending their title could be another of their periodic player revolts.
Last December, following a dispute with Michels, Gullit walked out of the
dressing room, and the team, just before the start of their qualifying game
against Greece.
There has been a strange whiff of player-power hanging over the England
team's run to the championship. When Graham Taylor, the manager, reverted
suddenly to a five-man defence after insisting for a long time that English
players were more comfortable with the familiar system of four defenders, he
indicated that the players wanted this change. After Wednesday's confused
display against Finland, Taylor has an excuse for going back quietly to the
familiar, dropping a centre back and playing an extra midfielder.
The problem is that England do not have four midfielders of international
quality - and Taylor showed that he recognised this when discussing possible
replacements for Barnes. He indicated that Keith Curle (yet another centre
half) rather than midfielder, Andy Sinton, would be his first choice. But
UEFA entered into the festive spirit and both received late invitations to
soccer's most exclusive party.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Sport: Graf needs the superhuman touch - This afternoon
Monica Seles will try to complete a hat-trick of French Open wins /  A look
forward to the final
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS afternoon's French Open final between the reigning world champion,
Monica Seles of Yugoslavia, and the woman she displaced from that pinnacle,
Germany's Steffi Graf, will be the eighth contest between these two since
they first met on the same slow clay of Paris in 1989.
Monica was 15 then, a tall thin girl with whirling matchstick limbs on which
she lurched about the court, projecting early double-handed forehands and
backhands of astonishing power and accuracy - each blow accompanied by a
ferocious grunt.
Steffi was 19, the perfect athlete and holder of all four grand slam titles,
as well as the winner of the Olympic gold medal. I still remember the look
of disbelief on her face when the precocious Yugoslav left-hander took the
middle set of their semi-final and pushed her to the limit in the decider.
This was the first time I had studied the remarkable Seles, and I could see
what Graf's father, Peter, had meant when he had told me two years earlier,
following Steffi's first grand slam success in Paris over Martina
Navratilova: 'The one to watch is Seles, she has a quality of shotmaking
that none of the others can match.' How right he was. A year after that
first meeting, on the eve of the 1990 French championships in Berlin, Steffi
lost for the first time to Seles, a decisive 6-4 6-3 and a prelude to
another success for Monica in the Paris final.
Seles knew the significance of that 7-6 6-4 win. 'That was so important to
me: a first grand slam title meant that I was up there with the others. I
was rather surprised that I won actually, but it meant that on clay at least
I could beat Steffi.'
It also meant that within four years the French Open had crowned three
youngest-ever champions. In 1987 Steffi won at 17 years, 11 months, 23 days.
Two years later Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario beat Graf to lower that record by
five months and in 1990 Seles became the champion at 16 years 6 months.
This will be the third encounter between Seles and Graf at these
championships, their second final on this famous showcourt, built in 1928 as
a stage for the four French musketeers, Borotra, Lacoste, Cochet and Brugnon
and the queen of French tennis, Suzanne Lenglen.
Borotra and Lacoste will probably be there today to see if Seles can achieve
something that even Lenglen never did by winning the French title three
years in a row. It is true that Lenglen was the champion from 1920 to 1923
but the event was a domestic French affair then.
Not until 1925 were overseas players admitted and Lenglen could win only
twice more in 1925 and 1926 before turning professional. The only players to
have scored the hat-trick are the Californian Helen Wills Moody (1928-30)
and Germany's Hilde Sperling (1935-37). Lenglen is someone whom Seles
greatly admires, an interest sparked by the late Ted Tinling who had once
been Suzanne's official umpire and later became the game's finest couturier.
It was no surprise when Monica appeared in a 1920's costume that Suzanne
would have adored, following her Australian Open win last January.
It was a gesture that said a great deal about Monica's sense of style and
timing, qualities that she required in full on Thursday to overcome a
determined challenge from Gabriela Sabatini.
Having watched their final in Rome last month, a match which had revealed a
new resourcefulness about the Argentinian No 1, I was waiting to see how
Seles would cope with the drop shots and cleverly angled volleys that had
defeated her that day. She very nearly did not cope at all. When Sabatini
led 4-2 in the final set I thought that Seles had left it too late after
squandering a winning opportunity in the second set when a break point that
would have left her serving for the match at 5-4 eluded her.
Not for the first time, Seles revealed her remarkable match-playing ability.
When all seemed lost and she looked tired, she stepped up the pace and broke
Sabatini to 15. An opening volley after a blazing return was followed by
some of the fiercest groundstrokes you will see - each piercing drive
faster, deeper, lower over the net than the last - to clinch the game.
It spelt the end of Sabatini's resistance. Three games in a row fell to
Seles, the last after saving two break points with two more blazing forehand
winners. The 6-3 4-6 6-4 victory was extremely impressive.
Earlier on Thursday, a day when the top four seeds were all involved in the
semi-finals for the first time in Paris since open tennis began in 1968, the
German had done well to beat Sanchez-Vicario. The Spaniard took the first
six games, just as she had done last year in inflicting a 6-0 6-2 defeat on
the former champion.
This was the worst beating ever endured by Graf. To her credit Graf began to
control her wayward forehand that had committed more than 20 unforced errors
in the opening set. Instead of pressing home her advantage, Sanchez-Vicario
played rather too carefully, trying to extract a win rather than impose one.
The tactic proved fatal for it allowed Graf to dig in and get some rhythm
and confidence.
By the end she was approaching her normal form with the sliced backhand,
deep and fast, digging into the red dirt to set up the openings for the
forehand winners which at last outnumbered forehand losers. The final
result, 0-6 6-2 6-2, measured Graf's improvement, but she will need to avoid
such a poor start today if she is to regain the title that she last held in
1988.
Steffi must remind herself that she beat Seles twice last year, once on hard
courts in the US and once on clay in Europe. However, neither win was in a
major event and Seles has shown that she reserves her best for these
occasions.
Already the winner of five grand slam titles at a younger age than anyone
before her and successful in the last four she has contested, it seems that
only a superhuman opponent can halt her progress. These past two weeks, Graf
has looked all too human.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Sport: Stuffing two-back elegantly - Croquet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICKY SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CROQUET has always had immense style, but the fourth world championship,
held in Newport, Rhode Island, last weekend, raised the game to a new level.
It also showed that croquet in the US has a style all its own.
This is most immediately evident in the language of the game. The Americans
bring a vibrancy to croquet terminology that is altogether lacking in the
British game. They talk of 'stuffing two-back' or 'having no fear of
deadness.'
The Americans' traditional 'nine-wicket' game is a direct descendant of the
croquet played in England over a century ago. But while the British game
developed in line with the game in Australia and New Zealand, US croquet
stayed provincial.
In some respects it still is. None of the members of the eight-man US
contingent reached the quarter-finals. On the other hand, in spite of a bad
start caused by less than perfect lawns and weather which changed from
blistering heat to freezing cold wind in the space of a day, three of the
six-man English group made it to the semi-finals, and the event was won for
the second time by 22-year-old Robert Fulford, the champion in 1990. In the
final, Fulford beat last year's champion, John Walters.
Tactically, the British are undoubtedly leaders in the game. Fulford had
been finding it hard to shoot straight on lawns that dipped and rolled
alarmingly. Very early in the tournament he recognised that the eventual
winner would be the player who best adapted to the conditions, and he set
about turning them to his advantage.
The New Zealanders had a strong team, not least in 17-year-old Aaron
Westerby who is the man to watch for the future. The Australians also played
a creditable tournament with Blaise Northey, a lively 19-year-old, and Colin
Pickering, a former Englishman, both reaching the quarter-finals.
But the English swept away the opposition in the 32-man event to take their
third win in four years. The Americans were disappointed, but what they
lacked in expertise they more than made up for in style. Their approach to
croquet is refreshingly different. They still see the game as primarily
'fun,' and they partied in Newport as hard as they played.
The Newport Casino proved an elegant setting and Newport, which prides
itself on its social aplomb, threw its doors wide to croquet.
Many of the town's summer hostesses flew in early to open their homes to
croquet players. People like me, more used to sharing a cramped bed and
breakfast in some draughty English seaside town, found ourselves residing in
vast summer mansions.
My hostess was a perfect example of US hospitality at its best. Her
graciousness was matched by many others in Newport who hosted an impressive
round of cocktail and dinner parties of the kind not seen by the British
croquet set since the turn of the century when tea parties and balls were
all the rage.
Since then, British croquet has lost some of its social charm in the long
hard struggle for recognition. The game is constantly handicapped by the
indecision of its governing body as to the correct path for future
development. Croquet desperately needs sponsorship but sponsors like large
crowds and impressive coverage which, say the traditionalists, would spoil
the character of the game.
The languid pace of croquet in Britain is reflected in the slowness of its
growth. Croquet has been on the brink of 'discovery' for the last 100 years.
In contrast, the US game has made great strides in a decade, and proof of
the Americans' determination lies in their inclusion in the Macrobertson
Shield Test in Australia next year. Participation in this four-yearly event
will confirm the US as part of the international croquet scene, a result for
which USCA president Foxy Carter has worked extremely hard.
Ashley Heenan, the New Zealand president of the World Croquet Federation,
believes US entry into the Shield also signals a new era in croquet - one in
which players will increasingly move towards a new and tougher
professionalism dominated by what the Americans call 'purse play.'

FT  06 JUN 92 / Sport: Streetwise key to numbers game - Soccer analyst Neil
Lanham looks at what it takes to win the European title
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL LANHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUST before the 1988 European soccer championship finals, the Netherlands
drew 2-2 in a match against England at Wembley in which they scored a goal
which followed 23 passes. Commentators waxed lyrical and said this was what
we would see in the finals.
The truth was very different. The Dutch won the championship because they
played the most 'streetwise' football. The winners in Sweden will do the
same. In five games in 1988, I recorded the following statistics:
Seven of the eight Dutch goals came from moves of three passes or less. The
40 per cent of the Dutch possessions that exceeded three passes brought one
goal.
Two-thirds of goals scored in the Dutch matches came from possessions
starting in the attacking third of the field and were far more likely to
produce goals than possessions that started deeper.
One-third of Dutch goals came without a prior pass - ie, directly off the
opposition (as were both goals in last month's England-Brazil match at
Wembley).
Two-thirds of the goals scored by the Netherlands' opponents were given away
by losing the ball in their own half.
We knew these things would happen before a ball was kicked because the same
ratios occur for every team everywhere and at every level of the game.
The Dutch simply played the ball more often in the way that brought the best
chance of scoring, and least often in a way likely to give goals away. They
averaged 36 long passes in midfield, which resulted in over half of their
goals, and 35 crosses a game, and these brought two-thirds of their goals.
Over the short five-game period, the Dutch deserved to win because:
More of their possessions reached the attacking third, or shooting area,
than any of the other semi-finalists; they averaged more shots per match and
more goals; and only the West Germans gave away fewer possessions in their
own half.
These statistics were repeated exactly in the average of the 52 games of the
last World Cup.
The merit of a performance and the result do not always go hand in hand, and
the team with the best performance over just four or five games might not
get the goals necessary to win a championship.
Psychologists tell us that 'man basks in the reflected glories in his fellow
man,' and delights in aesthetically beautiful but difficult moves. However,
the easy moves are more successful. Only one in 4,000 goals comes from moves
of 20 passes or more.
England under Graham Taylor have done well, but analysis shows they have
ridden their luck in not conceding more goals and have been fortunate to
score so many - and at the right times. Good and bad runs of chance can come
at any time but chance evens out eventually. England's recent good fortune
may well not continue in Sweden.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Travel: Cairo - laying the ghosts of an ancient past -
Nicholas Woodsworth abandons his Blue Guide and looks beyond the trappings
of history to find a vibrant city bursting with life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAD done what visitors to Cairo do. I had made a camel circuit of Cheop's
pyramid at Giza, trudged the gloomy halls of the Egyptian Museum, and bought
a Nefertiti bust in a pavement bazaar. I had even visited Dr Raghab's
Floating Papyrus Museum on the banks of the Nile and seen paper being made
as it was 3,000 years ago. But still I was not happy.
The problem was that everything I was seeing and doing revolved around the
ancient past. In my Blue Guide to Egypt, there were over 700 pages crammed
with facts and speculation about the past, but barely two words about life
in our own times. The attitude that what is very dead and very old is worth
a visit is fine for the Valley of the Kings, where residents were
eviscerated and embalmed several thousand years ago. But the residents of
today's Cairo are very much alive and kicking.
Stand on any street corner in the city and you can hardly doubt it. The
crowds are overwhelming, the traffic appalling, the din ferocious. Equipped
to handle a population a fifth of its size, Cairo is bursting at the seams.
Its telephones are crotchety, its power supply whimsical, its plumbing
capricious. Like the donkeys that pull its battered rubbish carts, it
hobbles along looking barely capable of fulfilling its duties.
Nonetheless, it does just that. It remains one of the world's great cities,
a vibrant, vital place. Burying my Blue Guide at the bottom of my suitcase,
I set out to meet some Caireans who could put the more recent past, present
and even the future into some sort of perspective.
* * * VICTOR Simaika may be old, but he is at some remove from the mummy's
tomb. On the morning I met him, a delightful and dapper 87-year-old
gentleman in elegant attire, he apologised for being a few minutes late. He
had, he said, been dancing until 3am, and felt a lie-in not amiss.
On the balcony of his Garden City flat we had tea and spooned thick-cut
English marmalade on to buttered toast. Which, I asked him, looking across
the Nile, was the liveliest part of the city? 'As far as I am concerned,' he
replied, 'it is on my walls.'
And so it was. In the lounge inside, amid mounted antelope heads, riding
trophies, polo match cups, rhino horns and paintings of favourite horses,
were framed photos of a life of social privilege and ease in Cairo that has
ceased to exist. Born into the Egyptian upper classes, educated in Paris and
London when he was not too busy dancing, Victor has pursued the life of a
sportsman, playboy and aristocrat with limitless style and energy.
Pointing to a photo of King Farouk presenting him with a trophy while the
Shah of Iran looks admiringly on, Victor told me of the great love of his
life, polo. He began playing in the 1920s, when British cavalry regiments
were still stationed in Egypt under the occupation. Victor remembers
afternoons at the Gezira Sporting Club when 300 polo ponies would be
gathered round the thundering fields, their Nubian grooms, in regimental
colours, sporting turbans with tails that hung to the ground. Few could
resist such a spectacle, least of all young, moneyed modern Egyptians like
himself looking for change.
He found it, perhaps too much of it. Until then the vast majority of
Egyptians lived on the land, Cairo was a city of less than 1m, and the
dislocations of Nasser's socialist revolution were undreamed of. Not even
tourism resembled today's mass affair. Only wealthy foreigners came to
Egypt, and they did so with an entourage of servants for the winter season.
On one occasion Victor accompanied a party in dinner jackets and evening
dresses across the desert, on donkeyback, to dine at the camp where the
British Egyptologist, Howard Carter, had recently discovered Tutankamun's
tomb. On another, he spent two months cruising the Nile on a private yacht
with Barbara Hutton, an experience he is not yet entirely over. How, he
asked me, could anyone today hope to sample the pleasures of Egypt on
three-day Nile excursions run by games hostesses? Some things, quite
evidently, can never be improved on.
* * * IF VICTOR is a voice from a Cairo that has disappeared, Adel Sabeth
is, in his own eccentric fashion, very much of the present. I met him in his
home, a crumbling, chaotically-kept 19th century pile surrounded by swirling
traffic. Sitting among a great shambles of books, crumpled sheets of paper
and unwashed coffee cups, he was covered in glue, the result of editing and
pasting television scripts.
For even its humblest inhabitant, Cairo is a political town. Politics
occupies roughly the same niche as football and the weather do in English
conversation. Adel has made a profession out of political debate. An
intellectual and writer, he has ridden out the wildest storms of Egyptian
politics close to their centre, writing books defending King Farouk - a
family relative - and condemning 30 years of state economic control. It has
not made him popular in all circles.
Today he is both enthusiastic and critical. Cairo for him is more than ever
the capital of the Arab world, a dynamic centre of commerce, culture,
politics and diplomacy whose influence spreads across the entire Middle
East. But while Cairo's role is pivotal, its civic competence is often
marginal; management, over-bureaucratisation and lack of incentive, all
hangovers from the Nasser era, prevent the development of a political
culture willing to seek solutions to Egypt's formidable problems.
And Egypt's problems are Cairo's problems. With only 4 per cent of its
territory arable, and the national population growing by 1m every eight
months, the capital is a target for large-scale rural migration. Over a
third of Egypt's 51m people are now estimated to be living in Cairo. With
them they have brought all the problems of supplying a largely illiterate
and unskilled population with food, education, housing and jobs. Most remain
unsolved.
Why, I asked Adel as he wiped a gluey knife on the kitchen tablecloth, were
Caireans not then rushing to the barricades? 'We are generally a tolerant,
moderate, and good-humoured people,' he replied. In addition, he reminded
me, Egyptians have for millennia lived in a paternalistic system. From the
start they were administered by a vast bureaucracy that controlled the
essential element of life, Nile irrigation. They were ruled by a living
deity, the pharaoh. In such a state, obsequiousness towards superiors and
fatalism towards life became daily habits. Even after 5,000 years, even
after the collapse of Nasser's revolution of state rule, these habits still
haunt Egypt.
'But we are a clever, enterprising people, despite everything,' said Adel as
I bid him farewell and shook his sticky hand. 'Go out into the streets and
you will see.'
* * * ADEL WAS right. In the narrow, tourist-packed warren of alleyways that
make up the vast Khan al-Khalili market, artisans and merchants were making
and selling everything imaginable at a furious pace. Worked brass, ivory,
wood, silver, cloth or copper, it was all being exchanged in great
quantities for thin bits of plastic - for those who accept all major credit
cards, the future holds some promise.
But it is not a future that appeals to those unlikely to get a slice of the
cake. In Fishawi's, a sidewalk cafe in the heart of the market, I met Ali
Darwish, bearded poet, short story writer and Sufi mystic. Here, at crowded
tables where foreign tourists blithely video-film other foreign tourists,
darker concerns bubble under the surface.
Beside Ali sat a co-religionist and healer, an old woman heavily wrapped in
cloth and turban. From time to time a Sufi adept would approach from the
passing crowd and with great ceremony receive from her a laying on of hands
and a blessing.
'Nasira can cure headaches, rheumatism, colds,' said Ali. 'She is a walking
pharmacy.' But Ali was not talking miracles today. Hunched over sweet tea
and glass water pipes, he and his friends were discussing a threat to
Egypt's future, Islamic fundamentalism.
'As a Sufi,' he told me, 'I belive in democratic rule through co-operation
and charity of the heart. I do not believe in rule by clergy. Fundamentalism
is an insecurity, brought on by the failures of the system to provide the
normal things of life. Its grasp is powerful, and growing every day in
Cairo. It makes us all afraid.'
For hours Ali talked in this vein, his hubble-bubble fragrant in air that
turned cool as the night drew on. I, too, was full of reflection. Kings and
shahs and turbans that touched the ground . . . dinner jackets and
Tutankamun . . . fatalism, sycophancy and pharaonic bureaucracies . . . Sufi
healing and rule-by-clergy . . . No matter where one turned in Cairo, all
paths led back to the past, and those things that seemed very old and very
dead lay just under a patina of modernism. Caught in a very modern Cairo
traffic jam on my way home a few minutes later, I began pining for my Blue
Guide once again.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Travel: Dingle's damp splendour / Tramping across the
deserted mountains of Europe's western-most beauty spot
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY TOOLE

<TEXT>
WHEN the film of Ryan's Daughter was released, one critic complained there
was too much emphasis on the scenery, whereas the grandeur of Ireland lay in
its people. While there is some truth in this, it can be said that the
beauty of Dingle, in south-western Ireland, has to be seen to be believed.
Its Atlantic beaches, backed by mountains, have a splendour rivalled by few
elsewhere in Britain. But it was the mountains I had come to explore. Though
it is firmly fixed on the tourist route, Tralee lacks much of the garish
vulgarity of nearby Killarney. It also lacks a lake so that, from the edge
of town, the eye is drawn toward the land sloping upward to the west: the
foothills of the Slieve Mish.
From Derrymore I took a narrow road past a number of farm buildings. The
steep, heavily vegetated sides that hung above the road were ablush with
colour: the purple of heather, foxgloves and orchids, yellow gorse, orange
lilies, pink honeysuckle and, as this was Kerry, the ubiquitous crimson
blaze of fuchsia.
I moved on to the open hillside. The ground rose steeply. Drizzly showers
blew in from the Atlantic and swept across Tralee bay. It seemed, for a
time, as though I had chosen the only wet, misty peaks on Dingle, for the
others to the west were clear. But persistence was rewarded, and good
weather followed.
Caherconree came into sight, hinting at a grandeur that might rival
Mangerton or the Macgillicuddy's Reeks. The promise was not quite fulfilled,
as scale was lacking, but there was ample compensation. From Gearhane summit
the whole peninsula, from Tralee to Brandon, opened out while south-westward
the edge of the Iveragh peninsula could be glimpsed across Dingle Bay.
On the western slopes of Caherconree lie the remains of the highest
fortified structure in Ireland, from which the mountain gets its name. It is
said to have been built in the first century AD, and was the legendary scene
of treachery involving Cuchullain and Blanaid, the wife of Curaoi.
In Ireland there are almost no tracks in the mountains. One has to study
one's map and pick out what appears to be the best or most interesting route
to a summit. I spent the night near the shore of Lough Slat, at the head of
the heavily forested Owencashla valley.
Above me stood Stradbally mountain. A fire-break led up the hillside. Open
ground above had been raked by drainage channels, now overgrown, into which
it was too easy to fall. A struggle through more conifer and thick gorse
made me wonder if I had taken the correct route but soon the trees were
behind me and the valley opened out to reveal Lough Caum, above which
towered great rock folds.
A steady ascent brought me to the summit of Stradbally, then a short drop to
the col and an easy uphill stretch led to Beenoskee. To the right lay a
tremendous fall to Lough Acummeen, the surface of which was being torn into
clouds of spray by a strong gale. The view of Brandon should have been good
from here, and certainly it rose impressively from the coastal plains; but
its head was hidden in Atlantic mists.
A descent of over a mile, southward, led to a col at the end of the
Owencashla valley. There I picked up what appeared to be a strange track,
more than 20 ft wide, taking a direct line up the slopes beyond. How had the
track been made, and by whom? Certainly not by walkers, for there are never
that many on any Irish mountain, except Croagh Patrick, the holy mountain.
Nor could it have been dug by machine, for the slopes were too steep and the
boulders too large.
Water? That would have flowed over the precipitous rim at too many points.
Only the footprints of countless sheep broke the surface of the peat. I was
glad of the track, however, as the alternative was an arduous trek over
heather and deep grass.
From the summit I dropped quickly to the shore of Lough Slat, accompanied by
the rain that had threatened all morning. Still mystified by the track, I
asked a forestry worker if he could enlighten me. It was, he said, a
fire-line, dug to protect the forest when it was first planted.
Beyond the Beenoskee-Stradbally group, almost everything can be given the
tag 'most westerly in Europe': Conor pass, Brandon, Dingle town, Mount
Eagle, Dunmore Head. The Conor pass is magnificent. Even Honister, Llanberis
and Glencoe are wanting by comparison. From its summit, several small peaks
can be reached with ease, some of them in a matter of minutes. The view is
out of all proportion to the small effort needed to reach them.
But the real magnet on this part of the peninsula is Mount Brandon. Brandon
can be climbed by way of the Saint's road from Ballybrack, in the west, in
not much more than an hour, but the slopes are easy and grassy and though
the view from the summit is the same as by any other route, one has the
feeling that it has not been earned. Full appreciation of the mountain is
only obtained by tackling it from the east.
From the village of Cloghane, a narrow road led to the south-west. About a
mile from the village I cut across fields to the southern tip of Lough
Cruttia and was then able to concentrate on the real struggle: the ascent of
Brandon peak, a 2,764-ft subsidiary of the true giant.
The slopes of Brandon peak are so steep that the contour lines on the map
blur into each other. It is not so much a scree slope as a near-vertical
field of boulders, up which one forces an improbable route.
A fox jumped from a rock just above me and bounded away to the south. A
little higher, a small family of wild goats, presided over by a shaggy
patriarch, watched warily as I climbed past them. The top of Brandon peak
was narrow and pointed, and rose into the lower strands of the cloud. From
here, a broad ridge led down to a grassy col, above which Brandon mountain
rose steadily.
The summit of Brandon holds, on the very edge of a precipice, the remains of
a church reputed to have been built by St Brendan. Its situation gives
testimony to the toughness of the man who, legend says, sailed away from
these parts in a leather-skinned boat to discover America centuries before
Columbus or Lief Eriksson.
Finally, I tackled Mount Eagle. At the summit I could see nothing, but so
close was the ocean that I was able to catch, just occasionally, the cries
of seagulls and the sound of waves breaking on Dunmore Head. If one were to
forget Iceland, then all of Europe lay to the east of me and the next
mountains west were the Appalachians. But they would have to wait for
another year.
An excellent book, recently published, is David Herman's Great Walks:
Ireland, which offers 30 walks of differing length and difficulty, from
short strolls to mountain scrambles. There are detailed route descriptions
and maps. The photographer is Michael J Stead. Publisher: Cassell, Pounds

FT  06 JUN 92 / Travel: Safe train to Buenos Aires / Beating off the
bureaucrats across the Andes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM LYNCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EL GRAN CAPITAN is one of the safest trains in South America. It covers the
400 miles between Posadas and Buenos Aires in only 20 1/2 hours, with a
large complement of railway officials tending a thoroughly-vetted group of
passengers.
Flying to Buenos Aires from the waterfalls of Iguazu is quick and relatively
cheap, but the two-day bus and train alternative offers the scenery of
northern Argentina, ruined Jesuit mission stations, railway nostalgia and an
encounter with bureaucracy.
You can never find a bureaucrat when you want one. The area around Iguazu,
where Brazil, Argentina and Paraguay meet, is green with uniformed frontier
guards, but the local bus from Foz do Iguazu (Brazil) to Puerto Iguazu
(Argentina) speeds through the Brazilian border post unchallenged and stops
for a matter of seconds at the Argentinian border, where a lone civilian
does little more than count the wheels.
Entering Argentina without an entry stamp in your passport is not
recommended, but trying to sort things out in Buenos Aires seemed a better
idea than going back to explain to an Argentinian border guard.
The road from Puerto Iguazu to Posadas winds through country that ranges
from dramatic to bucolic: near-jungle in the north, trim farms in the south,
their mate (tea) bushes clipped as neatly as suburban privet hedges.
The bus takes seven hours, tailing great lorryloads of timber and swinging
into dirt roads to visit villages, some brightly painted, others reminiscent
of the shanties of Rio.
Posadas itself is a grid of dull streets, a concrete square and phone boxes
which are prey to a school for vandals. An hour-and-a-half back up the road
is San Antonio Mini, the most accessible of the Jesuit mission stations.
Buses are cheap and frequent, but not generally at the times given by the
information kiosk at Posadas bus station.
San Ignacio was hacked out of the jungle after rotting roofless and
forgotten for a century. It was one of the missions built by Roman Catholic
priests in the early 16th century to help speed the conversion of the
indians. A community of 40,000 or more was centred on a still-magnificent
church of carved sandstone.
The settlement, and others like it, fought off slave raiders for a while,
but the Spanish government and the Pope became increasingly nervous that the
Jesuits might develop an independent theocratic enclave, so they told them
to get out in the 18th century. Most of the missions were abandoned over the
next 100 years.
The Argentine government has rehabilitated the huge settlement sensitively,
leaving enough trees to give shade and tranquility; there are not many
visitors. There is a museum at the gate. Other missions are emerging from
the jungle nearby.
Posadas railway station, a Victorian-style gem, reflecting the influence of
the British engineers who built the Argentinian network, sits beside
overgrown sidings at the northern end of the overgrown line. It handles only
two trains a day, but dealing with foreign tourists gives the staff plenty
to do.
The ticket clerk inspected my passport. The left luggage staff inspected my
passport and asked for a statement of what was in my bag. A railway
policeman inspected my passport and the bag and became irate when he
discovered I had forgotten to mention books in the contents list.
When I got back from San Ignacio, my bag had been loaded into a luggage van.
A ticket collector inspected my passport. A railway official inspected my
passport. A railway policeman inspected my passport. The inspections were
all conducted slowly and seriously, but failed to pick up the fact that I
had no entry stamp.
A large red and yellow diesel was attached, with much yelling of advice, to
the long line of blue, white and red coaches, and the train pulled out
roughly on time.
The train stopped in the almost-dark and was shunted into a siding to make
way for a faster freight train. The twin-berth sleeper compartments were
comfortable, and the bottom bunk folded up to become a proper seat - just as
well, given the length of time passengers spend on the train. The restaurant
car has Formica tables and metal slats on the windows. It is mainly used by
railway officials, who play cards through the night.
Getting to it is a little unnerving, as the air-conditioning consists of
leaving the carriage door open. There are menus, and you can place an order,
but nothing comes of it.
The morning run is through the pampas: millions of featureless
cattle-rearing acres, scattered houses and a few gauchos leading spare
horses.
The railway line itself is a sight, with ranks of signal levers at the ends
of the platforms of the little stations. The track is overgrown and the
long, slow bridges over the twisting Parana river offer glimpses of deserted
riverside factories.
The tourist police office in BA is an echoing hall in a ramble of buildings
near the docks. A frosty official asks exactly how long you want to stay in
the country and gives out a piece of paper with permission to stay one day
less.
Ten days later, at a remote frontier post in the Andes, a couple of border
guards were very reluctant to accept the piece of paper at all. I passed
into Chile in a cheerless farewell burst of form-filling, far from the
sunny, careless informality of the Brazilian border.
The cross-Andes trip was undertaken during a round-the-world trip arranged
through Trailfinders: London, Rio, overland to Santiago, Easter Island,
Tahiti, Sydney, Darwin, Cairns, Bangkok, London - Pounds 2,393.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Travel: Lahore - the elegance of three empires / Enjoying
the pleasures of a provincial capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO men are locked in aerial combat, a fight to the death above the
rooftops of Lahore. It is a battle of skill and timing. The weapon is ground
glass, mixed with sticky paste and spun on to flax to form a lethal string
hundreds of yards long. The object: for one man to manoeuvre his string over
that of the other, then twist and jerk and saw it until it cuts the twine,
leaving his rival's kite to flutter to earth while the winner's soars in
triumph.
Kite-flying is taken seriously in the capital of Pakistan's Punjab province.
A three-day festival is dedicated to it, when thousands of kites are
launched in pursuit of fleeting glory; during the rest of the year, the
city's parks and rooftops are packed with fliers every evening, their
scarred fingers a testimony to their art.
Lahore is not the biggest city in Pakistan, but it is the most beautiful,
packed with fine Moghul, Sikh and British Empire buildings, mosques and
forts, lush gardens and fountains, teeming bazaars jammed with hawkers,
tinsmiths, sandal-makers, dye shops, purveyors of sticky sweetmeats and
tackier clothing, cheap bangles and cheaper rings. There is poverty, but not
of the gut-wrenching, perpetually visible sort seen in many Indian cities.
The Shalimar Gardens, laid out by the warlord Shah Jahan in 1642, is a good
place to start: tiers of lush greenery filled with fountains and dotted with
bougainvillea. The smart set come here to see and be seen. Parakeets swoop
and dive, keeping their distance from the bullying, black-hooded crows
waddling through the undergrowth like ornothological louts.
The tombs of the Moghul emperor Jehangir and empress Nur Jahan lie a few
kilometres outside the city in a similar garden. The tombs - hers relatively
simple and serene, his an ornate mausoleum inlaid with semi-precious stones
 -are separated by a canal lined with rose bushes and mango trees: a
heavenly setting for the empress, who was known as the Light of the World.
The road back leads inevitably to The Mall, Lahore's main artery, lined with
modern buildings and offices, including a steel-shuttered BCCI branch. It is
worth stopping off at Kim's Gun, a 17th century cannon mentioned by Kipling,
whose father was curator of the museum for 18 years. But the main
attractions are to be found in the Moghul City, dating largely from the 16th
and 17th centuries and partly walled in by a brick rampart overlooking a dry
moat.
Badshahi Mosque has the most immediate impact, as one would expect from the
world's second largest mosque. Its warm red brick wall encloses a vast
courtyard thronged with the faithful each Friday; for the rest of the week
it echoes emptily to the sound of the hammers of stonemasons hand-lapping
new blocks for the eroded areas. The tall, graceful minarets lean out at a
slight angle: in the event of earthquake they would fall outside the central
courtyard to avoid crushing people inside.
Outside - and dwarfed by - Badshahi is the Gurudwara Arjun Singh, a Sikh
temple containing the ashes of Ranjit Singh, the Sikh ruler of Lahore who
died (peacefully) in 1849. Others were not so lucky: four of his wives and
seven concubines became satis at his cremation, flinging themselves on his
funeral pyre.
Opposite the temple and mosque is the Fort of Lahore, built largely by
Akbar, son of Babar, the first Moghul emperor, and improved by Jehangir and
Shah Jahan. All gave free rein to artistic extravagance. The result is a
melange of styles and excesses among which one can wander for hours.
The Palace of Mirrors is a series of rooms tiled with tiny, if now
tarnished, silvery slivers. The emperor of the day held his daily meetings
in The Hall of Public Audience, or received visitors perched on a marble
throne surrounded by cool water, musicians and dancing girls. Squads of
trumpeting pachyderms used to mount the great stairs of the Elephant Gate on
feast days. The stonemasons' skill is extraordinary: a tracery of
trellis-work turns out to be a solid four inches thick.
There are other fine buildings in the Old City surrounding the fort,
including the Golden Mosque, whose builder, Bokhari Khan, is said to have
been trampled to death by the handmaidens of a widow whose attentions he had
scorned. But the human element of the Old City is the main attraction - the
best and busiest bazaars are here, teeming with people, auto-rickshaws,
horse-drawn tongas (taxis) and innumerable eating stalls displaying
distinctly dead chickens.
Walking through the maze of narrow alleys can be risky. One is forever
leaping aside to avoid thundering water buffalo carts laden with sacks of
chapati flour, wizened old men staggering under impossible burdens, or
auto-rickshaws handled by drivers who are apparently deranged.
Towards dusk, colours become muted as dust is kicked up by innumerable feet,
until all detail is lost in haze and smog. Then is the time to take an
auto-rickshaw back to one's hotel. Agree a price, jump in, close your eyes,
hold your breath and put your faith in the Lord. If that does not work,
offer to pay double to get you back slowly.
Pakistan International Airlines flies to Lahore from London Heathrow via
Karachi on Wednesday, Friday and Sunday. Cheapest fare is Pounds 572 return,
minimum stay two weeks, maximum two months. Tel: 081-741-8066.
Hotels: The Hilton International and the Pearl Continental are comfortable
and relatively bland. Faletti's Hotel on Egerton Road is clean (if a little
basic), central and with a touch of character.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Travel: Regeneration of Goethe's spa / Visiting Karlovy
Vary, where BMWs have replaced Yuri Gagarin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES HENDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE last century, German wives would write into their marriage contracts
an annual, expenses-paid visit to a spa of their choice (not necessarily the
same one as their husband's). A spa visit was the fashionable thing to do: a
rejuvenating release from the routine, a moment to diet and generally dry
out before the coming year's excesses. Jaded wives and their liverish
husbands would head for a spa to walk the woods and colonnades, to catch the
afternoon concert and perhaps an admirer's eye, and to take the waters.
The most famous destination in central Europe was Karlsbad, perhaps because
its waters were the most efficacious, but more likely because the company
was the most illustrious. The Karlsbad guest-list read like a roll-call of
European aristocracy. It was known as the Adelsbad, the spa of the nobility.
Karlovy Vary (the Czech for Karlsbad) is hidden in the high Bohemian forests
not far from Czechoslovakia's border with Germany. Hundred-yard sweeps of
sumptuous neo-classical and renaissance-type facades snake along a tight
river valley, while behind them tall, turn-of-the-century villas stand
higgeldy-piggeldy on the hillsides. It is a luxurious town.
Karlsbad became the in-place when it was patronised by Goethe at the turn of
the 19th century. He made 14 visits in all and liked the place so much that
it brought him out in verse. One of the earliest visitors was General
Wallenstein who, in order to cure his gout, travelled there with a retinue
of 50 coaches, oxen, lambs and enough beer and wine to put his physicians in
a faint. He was walking again in a few weeks.
Peter the Great came to take the waters in the early 1700s and later in the
century Prince Metternich, the Austrian chancellor, visited the spa to
conduct confidential meetings.
In its heyday in the second half of the last century, the town saw further
political manoeuvrings when King William of Prussia and Bismarck came to
treat with Emperor Franz-Josef of Austria. They did not reach an agreement
and soon they were at war.
Apart from royalty, Karlsbad also attracted the leading writers and
musicians of the day. Goethe's friend and fellow playwright Schiller had to
sink 18 beakers of spring-water after lunch and dinner each day. Fontane,
Stifter, Turgenev and Tolstoy came, as did Liszt, Paganini, Wagner, Richard
Strauss, Brahms, Chopin and Dvorak, after whom a park is named. In Lazne I,
the principal public bath-house and casino, there are two huge tableaux of
Karlsbad notables from across the centuries.
Another famous visitor was Karl Marx, who was watched by the police during
his visit. Seventy years later a statue was raised to him in the town. After
the war, the spa of the nobility became the spa of the people.
There was a hierarchy to the hotels in the communist years. Czech communist
party members would stay in the Bristol Hotel and soldiers in the White
Cross Sanatorium; foreigners were usually sent to the Richmond, slightly out
of town. And strangely, for the 40 years of their influence, the Soviets
quite unashamedly occupied an imposing hotel on the hill-top with the
unlikely name of the Imperial. The communist legacy still remains in one or
two buildings, nightmares in ferro-concrete, but otherwise 40 years of
imposed uniformity has utterly failed to suppress the town's old atmosphere
of self-assured luxury.
The cumbersome names are gone already. The Czechoslovak-Soviet Friendship
Colonnade is known as Zitkova after its architect and by its old German name
Muhlbrunnen. Yuri Gagarin has been deposed from his titular position at the
town's central colonnade; now it is just known as the Sprudel. After a spell
as the Moskwa, the Grand Hotel Pupp is preparing to reclaim its former
position as one of the leading hotels in Europe. BMWs and Mercedes are
already beginning to pull into the forecourt.
Among the many sanatoria there are four main public spas, oddly numbered
Lazne I, III, V and VI. The most famous is Lazne I, so grand that it looks
more like a theatre than a public bath-house.
Inside it is warm and steamy, with the slightly fusty smell of a peat-bog
rising up the grandiose stairway from the basement. It even feels fertile
and regenerative, as though something might sprout.
You see the crowds queueing dutifully, filling in their treatment cards
before lying in a darkened room for a pelloid pack or for electrotherapy,
presided over by business-like women in white coats - the sort of place
James Bond might have ended up on a bad day a few years ago. Lazne I is also
known as the Kaiserbad and downstairs you can take a mineral jacuzzi in
Emperor Franz-Josef's private bathroom.
The traditional treatment in the spa is still the ambulante kur, the walking
and drinking cure. There are 12 main springs in the town, set in four
colonnades. Thousands of walkers parade up and down the streets each day,
pausing occasionally to take a snifter. Bulbous silver taps splutter with
the mineral water (which forces its way out from hundreds of feet down) into
marble bowls, at anything from 30' 70' centigrade. You drink it from a
special cup with a spout, so that the minerals by-pass your teeth, and
regulars even lodge their cup with a concierge, drawing it out each day when
they come to take the waters.
The water is slightly viscous, sulphurous and in general pretty revolting.
But drink it they do, cup after cup, on doctor's orders.
If the idea of 50 glasses of disgusting water in a day is daunting, then
another essential part of the walking cure might be more appealing: the
cafe. Karlovy Vary is a leisurely town and you will see hungry guests
whiling away the hours between healthy forest walks in the hills and the
afternoon concerts. The Cafe Elefant has faithfully been serving
surreptitious visitors for nearly 300 years. Once the guests have left their
hotel, no longer under the gaze of medical minders in the sanatorium, they
race down here and gorge themselves on an apfelstrudel and Chantilly cream,
just to spite their three weeks of fasting, and put a few pounds straight
back on.

FT  06 JUN 92 / There's something nasty at the bottom of the garden /
Visiting a Dutch village which has woken up to pollution
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUDEL-DORPLEIN is one of those villages that the Dutch do so well. The
houses are solid and substantial. Gardens are lovingly tended; even the
trees seem to be carefully trimmed into shape. No scrap of litter, no stray
dog, is permitted to mar the village's bourgeois charm.
Yet there is something strange about the houses at one end of the village.
They obviously were built many years ago - one has 1901 etched into its
brickwork - yet all the gardens are brand new. That is because staff from
the Dutch Environment Ministry recently dug up the old gardens, full of
well-established plants, vegetables, bushes and trees and carted them away -
together with all the top soil.
'Some of the people did not want to lose the gardens they had looked after
from many years,' says Marinus van Weel, director of water, environment and
transport for the Noord-Brabant regional government. 'But one by one they
gave in as their neighbours decided to let their gardens go.'
From the new gardens there is a clear view across neighbouring marshland,
teaming with wildlife attracted by the area's tranquillity. There is a green
pond with a sandy scum around its edge - and beyond it, a tall chimney
pinpointing the Budel zinc smelter.
The smelter produces cadmium, and the Budel-Dorplein gardens were ripped up
because they were contaminated with this metal, one of the most toxic known
to man. The human body cannot cope with cadmium - the metal builds up in the
kidneys and destroys them.
This episode is only a small part of an environmental drama of extreme
complexity being played out in the Netherlands. It shows that cleaning up
Europe after 100 years of industrial pollution can never be easy, and is
expensive.
It it a stark demonstration of the fact that when one government opts for
environmental standards that are higher than those of its international
neighbours, it does so at the risk of damaging or even killing off its
domestic industry. It carries a warning that, in Europe, society will
increasingly have to choose between a cleaner environment or a loss of
manufacturing jobs.
In this case it might result in the closure of one of the world's most
efficient zinc smelters, because it happens to be in the Netherlands rather
than in Belgium, two kilometres away, where environmental standards are less
exacting.
There is no doubt about the source of the pollution at Budel-Dorplein. The
village grew up in sight of the Budel smelter, one of eight similar plants
established at the turn of the century along the Belgian-Dutch border. Over
the years the smelters severely polluted, with cadmium and other metals, 800
square kilometres of land in the Kempen region, which also straddles the
line between Belgium and Holland. The Dutch government says that, as with
the gardens at Budel-Dorplein, the contaminated earth should be cleaned up.
The Netherlands has some of the most strict environmental standards in the
world. Much of the country is at or below sea level, so the water table is
very close to the surface and can easily be contaminated. Dutch regulations
state that if the level of cadmium in the soil reaches 20 milligrams per
kilogram of dry material, the soil should be sanitised.
Yet, although there are no obvious signs of ill-health among the local
population, the gardens at Budel-Dorplein were excavated if they contained
an average of 2.5 milligrams a kilo - just one eighth of the accepted
maximum level.
Cadmium pollution in the Kempen region was caused by old technology - old,
coal-fired smelters which spewed out contaminated smoke and ash. At Budel
these were replaced by modern, electrolytic plant in 1973. But for nearly
three quarters of a century the old smelter produced waste ash, which was in
great demand. It was used to pave 800 kms of roads in the area. Local
farmers scattered the ash around their lands because it was cheap and no
weeds grew in it. Nobody knows just where all the cadmium-contaminated ash
went but they do know that, ever since it was first used, rain has been
leaching out the cadmium and other heavy metals.
That is all history. Today the Budel smelter, jointly owned by Billiton, the
metals arm of the Royal Dutch/Shell group, and Pasminco, the Australian
metals company, is one of the world's most efficient. It contributes about 5
per cent of the western world's zinc - a product much in demand, mainly for
galvanising steel used by the construction and automotive industries.
In its way, zinc is an environmentally-friendly metal because it protects
products against rust and makes them last longer. But the legacy of past
pollution haunts the smelter. Huge quantities of ash were used to provide a
base for buildings, roads and storage areas on the smelter site and metal is
being leached out of it into the ground water. Only 10 kms away, the town of
Weert is pumping ground water up for drinking. Also, a waste storage pond
constructed in 1973 is leaking into the ground water, although this is being
contained by an drainage system underneath.
Budelco, the company which owns the smelter, has, with the help of
consultants TAUW and Grondmechanica Delft, devised an ingenious 'water
curtain' to contain pollution from the smelter ashes and leaking pond.
Twelve wells have been drilled and a water purification plant has been
installed to suck up contaminated water and purify it.
These efforts to eliminate its pollution problems might be to no avail and
the Budel smelter might still be forced to close. For it is running out of
space to store acadmium containing hazardous waste, called jarosite. At
present this yellowish, sandy substance is stored in three artificial ponds
lined with heavy-duty plastic. During the past 20 years the smelter has
generated nearly 2m tonnes of jarosite and continues to produce 100,000
tonnes a year. The Noord-Brabant regional government says this cannot
continue - the ponds already cover 50 hectares or half a square kilometre -
and the smelter must find another method of dealing with this substance.
By working flat-out since 1985 Budelco has, in co-operation with Outokumpu,
the Finnish metals group, developed a method of smelting (or burning)
jarosite to turn it into an inert material which can be used for
construction and road building. But Budelco cannot afford to use this
technology - it would increase the smelter's costs by 25 to 30 per cent and
leave it unable to compete with other zinc smelters world-wide.
The Budel smelter provides more than 600 jobs, nearly 20 per cent of them
for Belgians, and is estimated to support about 3,000 people in all. So
there is a great deal of sympathy for its predicament at the Noord-Brabant
government's headquarters in Den Bosch, 70 kms north of Budel. But the
regional government, which licenses the smelter's operations, insists that
the waste material must be treated differently in future.
Marinus van Weel is an affable individual and by no means an environmental
crusader. But he says, firmly: 'If we force the smelter to close it will not
be a popular decision. But if we have to choose between employment and the
environment it will not be difficult. Unemployment in the Netherlands is not
that high.'
Noord-Brabant cannot offer financial help, so Budelco is negotiating with
the Dutch government. The burden of saving the smelter is carried by Wim de
Graaff, the company's general manager. He says: 'We have come to a point
where a decision has to be made. We are the only zinc smelter in the world
being pushed to smelt jarosite. We don't mind being environmental guinea
pigs but to compensate we must be financially assisted, either by the Dutch
government or by the European Community.'
de Graaff, 54, a geologist by training with 30 years in the mining and
metals industry, agrees that stopping present groundwater pollution from the
jarosite ponds on its site is the responsibility of Budelco. He says: 'We
can't just say our fathers and grandfathers did it wrongly, but our job is
to go on making zinc.'
He argues, however, that the expensive jarosite processing project can only
be contemplated if Budelco is given financial help until the rest of the
industry catches up. Most zinc smelters are producing iron-rich jarosite,
all contaminated with heavy metals, and he suggests that in due course EC
harmonisation will force at least those in the Community to follow the 'best
practice' pioneered by Budelco. But that might take many years.
Budelco has already spent more than Fl 30m (Pounds 10m) on research and
development associated with treating jarosite. A jarosite smelter would to
cost about Fl 400m (Pounds 133m). Jarosite has to be burned at 1,600 degrees
C so annual fuel costs would be high.
Other zinc smelters have been contacted but say they do not wish to share
the technology and the costs. So very recently the new process was adapted
to treat sludge from water purification plants and contaminated harbour
sludge as well as jarosite. Water authorities at Noord-Brabant and Limburg
'are interested but sitting on the fence.'
Meanwhile, one option de Graaff must consider is the smelter's phased
closure over the next two years. 'It might seem silly to close down this
smelter and then import zinc from Belgium a few kilometres away, but the
Dutch are a strong-minded people and it might well come to that,' he says.
Budelco would take responsibility for ensuring that there was no ground
water pollution from the smelter site but would resist pressure to
contribute towards cleaning up the mess outside the site caused by polluted
ashes and by the previous owners.
Neither would Budelco take kindly to any suggestion that it should
contribute towards cleaning up the rest of Kempen valley, where the average
cadmium contamination is over 1 milligram a kilo and in some areas more than
5.
The Dutch government is still mulling over what it should do about the 300
square kilometres of polluted land on its side of the border. It spent Fl
18m to replace contaminated soil and vegetation in 66 relatively small
gardens in Budel-Dorplein. The cost of doing the same in all Kempen would be
prohibitive.
