FT  06 JUN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Gnome improvements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE FEWINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS nothing like a gnome to cheer you up in a recession. Forget the
Private Eye advertisments and the decades of being shunned by polite
society: the little fellows are working overtime to keep us happy during
these difficult days.
At least that is the view of Tessa and John Newman, who for the last four
years have concentrated exclusively on selling garden gnomes. Their company,
De Gama, stocks all sizes, in just about every pose that is not deviant, in
the converted coach house at the rear of their large Regency terrace house
in Bath.
'Apart from a brief dip at the end of last year the gnomes have been selling
better than ever during the recession,' said Tessa. 'We are currently
carrying nearly 200 different styles and expect to sell about 50,000 and to
turn over about Pounds 500,000 in the current financial year.' After 20
years in the importing business - originally they concentrated on Spanish
ceramic ware - the Newmans reckoned they had seen all types and style of
gnome before deciding to concentrate on plastic German models. That was four
years ago. They rapidly found they sold so well that there was little space
left in their warehouse for other lines. The gnomes had taken over.
'Concrete gnomes were too crude and heavy. They chip very easily and rarely
have the fine outlines of our plastic models,' said Tessa.
'Ceramic ones are usually much nicer and we are building up our own range of
these, made by a West Country potter. However, although frostproof, they
break easily - particularly if there happen to be vandals around. Really
they are more suited to indoor conditions.
'On the other hand the plastic ones look equally good inside or outside.
They do not break unless very badly handled, and they retain their colours.
About 15 years ago people didn't seem to like plastic gnomes at all. But all
that seems to have gone now.
'Plastic gnomes seem perfectly acceptable and I would say that about 50 per
cent of gnomes sold in this country are plastic.' Another change in recent
years has been the trend towards keeping gnomes indoors. In urban areas this
may be a result of vandalism, but the Newmans have another theory.
'When you have them in the home they do help to cheer the place up,' John
said. 'During the recession I have noticed that we have sold many more
smiling ones. I say a gnome in the home is worth two in the garden.'
Serious collectors - some people have hundreds - like to keep their gnomes
under cover for security purposes.
'Perhaps this is also because many people laugh at huge collections of
gnomes in the garden. They are after all, things that people either love or
loathe,' said Tessa.
'Many people look upon them as pets without the tie and there is no doubt
that a gnome can bring a great deal of pleasure to many different sorts of
people,' said Tessa.
'We have a huge correspondence, especially from people that want to build up
their collections, but also from people who like to talk about their gnomes;
they even send us poems written about them.'
Even though the indoor market has grown, the UK gnome market is small
compared with Germany and Switzerland.
'The UK market is reckoned to be a quarter of the size of the Swiss one,
despite the fact that our population is much greater,' John said.
'Only 8 per cent of gardens in this country have gnomes in them, whereas in
Germany and Switzerland it is far higher.' The Newmans would like to change
that by expanding the network of agents covering the 400 UK retail outlets
De Gama serves. They aim to sell to some of the big chains of garden centres
where gnomes are not at present welcome.
'We smiled when we saw the recession coming on. It has certainly helped us,'
John said.
'Let's hope there are no booms round the corner. That is the time when
people go out and spend their money on other, more expensive things like big
cars and exotic holidays.'
They could buy one of the Newman's top-of-the-range gnomes: 1 metre high.
One, complete with wheelbarrow, retails at about Pounds 200 compared with
the Pounds 13-Pounds 14 for an average size De Gama gnome.
The greatest possibility for expansion seems to lie in bespoke and
personalised gnomes, says John.
'Providing there is a run of about 1,000 we can do bespoke ceramic gnomes
for specific promotional purposes,' he said.
'We are just realising the potential of this, with orders from businessmen
who want special gnomes that might look like themselves or their customers.
'Companies are also beginning to see the value of gnomes as giveaways at
Christmas, or as promotional tools of a different kind. Really there's a
potential for a whole new breed of Lord Gnomes all over the country.'

FT  06 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Mixed mortgages
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I HAVE moved home as a result of changing my job and am renting out my main
residence. I am considering purchasing a second property for investment
purposes and renting that out as well.
1. Can the excess interest on the loan for the second property, over and
above rental income, be used to offset tax on the income from letting my
original home?
2. Does it matter, for tax purposes, on which house the loan for the second
property is secured?
3. Can qualifying expenses incurred in the tax year immediately prior to
letting these properties, and solely related to preparation for letting, be
used as an allowance for tax purposes against rental income in the current
tax year?
4. Can you recommend a thorough text which covers residential lettings in
detail?
The solicitors who act for you in the purchase will, of course, be able to
guide you through the income tax and capital gains tax maze. (Before
formally appointing a firm to act for you, however, it would be prudent to
check that it has someone who is competent in the tax aspects of domestic
property transactions.)
1. Yes; subject to the conditions set out in section 355(l) (b) of the
Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 by virtue of section 355(4).
2. No; it is the use of the borrowed money which matters - not the security
for the loan by virtue of section 354(l).
3. No. However, such expenditure may be deductible in calculating the
chargeable gain when the house is sold, by virtue of Inland Revenue
statement of practice D24:
'Expenditure on initial repairs to a property (including expenditure on
decorations) undertaken in order to put it into a fit state for letting, and
not allowable for the purposes of Schedule A, is regarded as allowable
expenditure for capital gains tax purposes under section 38(1) of the
Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992.'
4. You are probably better off talking to your chosen solicitor.
The following free pamphlets from your tax office may be helpful, but they
tend to oversimplify the intricate and arbitrary rules laid down by
Parliament:
CGT4 - Capital gains tax: owner-occupied houses
IR87 - Rooms to let

FT  06 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Distrusted trustees
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH MY father died in December 1988, his trustees have still to render
final accounts. Is there a time-limit?
Because the original will went astray in the post, granting of probate was
delayed until October 1989 and, as a consequence, the estate incurred losses
resulting from a slump in the housing market and an increased liability for
rates, community charge, etc and an over-charging of property tax. Can the
trustees be made liable for these losses?
The trustees have invested all monies held in trust for minor beneficiaries
in one building society; but I have been told that only 50 per cent of such
assets may be so invested. What is the present state of the law?
The beneficiaries have sought explanations from the trustees; but without
much result.
There is no formal time limit, but a simple estate should be resolved within
a year of the probate being extracted. The trustees would not normally be
liable for the loss of the will in the post.
The question of what investments are permitted will depend on whether your
father's will contained an express provision enlarging the statutory powers
of investment (it is likely to do so if drawn up by a solicitor). If it does
not, the provisions of the Trustee Investments Act 1961 would apply to limit
to half the fund the amount which may be invested in wider range
investments. This can have the effect of reducing the available return on
investment.
If you are in doubt about the trustees' dealings with the estate, consult a
solicitor.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: Squeeze on non-UK accounts /
Examining the Revenue's latest crackdown
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OVERSEAS residents with accounts at some building societies in the UK face
having them closed following a clamp-down by the Inland Revenue.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester and Nationwide have written to these residents - who
do not have to pay UK income tax - advising them to switch to another
account.
In January, the Revenue placed new conditions on the operation of
international accounts opened by people claiming to be resident abroad but
living in the United Kingdom. Tougher regulations now oblige banks and
building societies to monitor the accounts more closely.
The Revenue's measures include giving itself the right to audit non-UK
accounts if it is not unsatisfied with the way banks and societies are
dealing with them.
Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester said this week: 'We felt that the cost of
implementing the rulings - monitoring the accounts and the auditing
requirements - was not justified by the number of accounts held.'
From June 30, C&amp;G will be closing its international accounts and
transferring non-UK residents to its Gold account, which does not pay gross
interest. The account-holders will have to reclaim the tax.
Nationwide has also written to its international account-holders advising
them to transfer their accounts offshore, where the matter of whether they
are UK residents will not be at issue. It, too, will be closing its
international accounts from July 1.
Non-UK residents should, therefore, use this opportunity to consider
offshore accounts - other than that of their own building society - to find
which pays most.
Someone who was moved by C&amp;G into its Cheltenham Gold account would receive
8.3 per cent gross on Pounds 25,000 compared with 9.6 per cent on its
Guernsey Gold account. But there are better rates available elsewhere
offshore.
Bradford &amp; Bingley, for instance, is paying 10.35 per cent gross on Pounds
25,000 at its subsidiary on the Isle of Man.
David Tucker, of Chase de Vere, the independent financial advisers, says:
'It is crucial that investors are made aware of the wide range of accounts
available offshore. But they must make sure that the offshore account they
are being offered is paying the optimum interest rate.'
One drawback is that investors who move their accounts offshore no longer
get the protection offered by a UK building society, which will cover up to
90 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 invested.
The Isle of Man has legislation similar to that in the UK and covers up to
75 per cent of the first Pounds 20,000 invested. However, the liabilities of
an offshore subsidiary of a UK building society are still protected by the
1986 Building Societies Act.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: Playing it safe in retirement -
Weekend FT reader Antony Michell explains his strategy for setting - and
achieving - realistic targets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MANY people regard investing as a hit or miss fun occupation
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
some you win, others you lose. But for us pensioners, safety is all
important. Unlike younger people, we cannot replenish our funds when we make
mistakes.
While most investors select shares which they hope will outperform the
market, I suggest pensioners should decide what rate of return is reasonably
possible and then select their portfolio to obtain such a return. To achieve
this, consider the following factors. Remember that investing is not a game
for us but a serious job. If you do not have enough income, then be even
more careful. Do not try to compensate by buying shares which may make your
fortune.
Force yourself to examine your portfolio objectively at least twice a year
and make decisions based on the outlook for the share, not necessarily on
its past performance. Too many of us become attached sentimentally to an old
faithful which performed brilliantly for us 10 years ago. The outlook might
now be indifferent.
Decide what return on your investment you can reasonably expect. I try to
make a 4.5 per cent real rate per annum. Aiming for much more is taking too
high a risk, while aiming lower means that you are not even trying to
perform as well as some gross building society funds.
Do not touch shares unless you have more than Pounds 70,000. Stay with
building societies and National Savings.
Select several types of investment such as Tessas (tax-exempt special
savings accounts), two-year and one-year term shares with building
societies, and postal accounts for immediate needs. Then, put a substantial
amount in investment trusts to provide equity investment and add gilts plus
index-linked and other forms of National Savings.
Like me, you might also have some endowment policies yet to mature (many of
which have excellent records, due partly to the now-defunct life assurance
premium relief), and perhaps some investment bonds. Index-tracking stocks
and zero coupon preference shares are also an essential portfolio component
for me.
Selecting a balanced portfolio is crucial. It should minimise risks from
inflation, geographical location, industry, economies and political
uncertainties. In this context, the proportion invested in each of these
sectors needs careful thought.
Try to be honest with yourself and to realise that you are not usually
smarter than the market. It is sobering to sit down and calculate your
average return over the past five years, and assess whether your performance
has kept up with what the building society offers.
Remember that the glamour years of the 1980s are over and much slower
economic growth can be expected. Therefore, real returns of 5-6 per cent may
be the norm in the 1990s.
Spread risk, but do not pay high fees to do so. For this, investment trusts
are ideal, but stick to the International and UK General trusts, of which
more than 25 have excellent long-term records.
Many investment trusts in a personal equity plan (Pep) have low charges and
are most interesting (but only if you have more than about Pounds 100,000 of
investments in order to benefit from capital gains tax).
Cash on deposit within a Pep is another useful benefit. I do not invest in
many unit trusts and managed Peps because these, together with insurance
bonds, are a more costly form of investment, although apparently changing
now.
Investment in a few equity shares is too much of a risk. An investment in
Polly Peck would have affected a personal portfolio badly, but collective
trusts covering 100 or more companies can afford a few duds. Above all, do
not be tempted to buy after reading or hearing favourable comment about a
single company.
Bearing all of this in mind, you can now convert everything into REAL money
(after deducting inflation) and make a table such as the one above, with
yields after tax.
It illustrates a spread of investments of Pounds 200,000 (for a couple where
the wife obtains some gross interest).
The capital gain requirement column is the percentage that the investment
must rise each year so that, when added to its real yield, it provides the
key 4.5 per cent which we expect our investments to achieve. This assumes
that the market ascribes approximately correct yields to shares.
The next column is my own estimate of the probability of this investment
achieving that target.
The last column is my estimate of the same probability over the next five
years. Clearly, the risk rises with time, except for index-linked stocks.
Inflation plays a key role in fixed-interest real rates, and I assume an
increase in RPI of 6 per cent when making the estimates. This is not a
forecast but perhaps a reminder of what could happen again.
So, over the next 12 months I hope the Tessas and index-linked National
Savings are 95 per cent and 100 per cent certain to achieve the target 4.5
per cent. However, I rate the Xyz share, which is in Europe, as having only
a 40 per cent chance of success (although 55 per cent over the five-year
term). Perhaps this should be sold.
Pep investment trusts are rated at 85 per cent because of their long-term
performance and excellent spreads. Endowments are also expected to achieve
8.6 per cent growth with 90 per cent probability in the short term because
they, too, have excellent records.
For too long, investors have differentiated capital gain from yield. For us
pensioners, a gain is a gain whether it is made up of 5 per cent yield plus
10 per cent capital increase, or 10 yield plus 5 per cent capital gain.
Combining these in the table and using real, after-tax values should help to
clear one's thoughts.
All this might appear extremely cautious, but my experience has been that I
rarely outperform the FT Index over the whole of my investments. However,
with assiduous attention, this 4.5 per cent target might well be surpassed.
One final thing, which is more important than anything else - keep yourself
fit to enjoy the spoils.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: Money down the drain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NEW survey by the Financial Adviser newspaper suggests that investors are
still throwing money down the drain by surrendering their endowment policies
early.
It found that more than 25 per cent of the 25-year with-profits policies -
the kind most often used to back up a mortgage - taken out in 1989, had
already lapsed.
For 10-year plans, where investors had made a less onerous commitment, the
lapse rate was just over 17 per cent.
As a general rule, it is only possible to get good value from an endowment
policy if you hold it to maturity, while surrender should be treated as a
last resort.
Early surrenders are expensive for all concerned, as the costs of
administration are loaded at the beginning of the policy. So these figures
could have a revealed a serious problem.
However, it is difficult to draw many confident conclusions as only 12 life
companies provided figures. Two of these, both with high surrender rates,
remained anonymous.
The Securities and Investments Board produced a report at the end of last
year which suggested that in 1990, 37.1 per cent of unit-linked endowments
and 23 per cent of with profits policies were terminated within two years of
being started.
Several prominent figures in the life industry queried the findings,
although few came forward with their own figures. The 12 offices who
answered Financial Adviser should at least be congratulated for their
candour.
In the figures for 1989 policies, NPI, which distributes through independent
advisers only, shows up best, with 99 per cent of both 10- and 25-year
policies surviving after three years. Next come Scottish Widows (94 per cent
over both terms), and Tunbridge Wells Equitable (93 per cent of 10-years and
88 per cent of 25-years).
The UK's two leading mutual societies, Standard Life and Norwich Union, both
saw a disquieting number of surrenders. Only 85 per cent of the 10- and
25-year policies Standard Life wrote in 1989 are still on the books, while
NU has retained 81 per cent of 10-year, and 82 per cent of 25-year
contracts.
Particularly low 25-year figures came from Sun Alliance, where 35 per cent
of policies have already lapsed, Prosperity Life (37 per cent) and Britannia
Life (32 per cent).
Only four offices - one of them anonymous - told Financial Adviser how many
of their 25-year policies written to mature this year actually did so.
Friends Provident's rate was 69 per cent, and Scottish Widows' 60 per cent,
while Norwich Union's survival rate was only 37 per cent. One anonymous
office had a survival rate of 38 per cent.
In this light, league tables of maturity values begin to lose some of their
point. The value you can receive after 25 years is considerable. But too
many investors never receive it.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: Mexico's bulls are running - A good
performance but remember the risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATIN America has proved an enormously popular emerging market and Mexico
has been a prominent part of its success. Last year, Latin American
Investment Trust was the best performing of all investment trusts with a
rise in its net asset value of 124 per cent. In November, 40 per cent of its
fund was in Mexico but this has now dropped to 29 per cent.
Although Mexico's performance has been good, like other Latin American
markets, it has a potential for volatility that means it is no place for
savings you cannot afford to lose.
The Mexican stock exchange rose by 103 per cent last year and, with a market
capitalisation of Dollars 134bn to the end of March 1992.
The government of President Carlos Salinas de Gortari has followed free
market policies, cut the government budget deficit, removed tariff barriers
and privatised state-owned industry. Talks are proceeding over a free trade
agreement with the US and Canada.
Kevin Carter, of Providence Capitol, which last September launched Latin
American Companies, a unit trust with Mexico as the largest holding, expects
the US will want to head a trading bloc of its own to rival Europe and
Japan. 'It is inconceivable that Mexico will not be integrated with the US.
Mexico can be seen as as a low-cost production centre for the US while
America is a huge market for Mexico,' he said.
The Mexican market was flooded with new stock issues last year as industry
sought financing ahead of the free trade pact which is due to be signed next
year. The trend is set to continue. Around 80 companies were privatised last
year including 12 banks.
About two dozen companies issued stock last year. The first and largest was
Telmex, the country's telephone monopoly, which has been the most actively
traded stock. Other large companies followed, including Cemex, the
state-owned cement company and Banacci, the largest financial group. Mexican
companies placed around Dollars 4.8bn (Pounds 2.66bn) of stock last year and
have raised another Dollars 3.6bn so far this year, with more to come.
However, the market is dominated by the top six companies which account for
more than 70 per cent of the trading volume.
President Salinas's economic management team has been praised for being
young, dynamic and pragmatic. It brought down inflation from just under 30
per cent in 1990 to 18.8 per cent last year. Real GDP growth was 4 per cent
in 1991 compared with 3.4 per cent the year before.
As a result, many fund managers regard Mexico as more than an emerging
market.
In one sense, Mexico's market has 'emerged' with the approval given by the
Securities and Investments Board at the end of May for unit trust investment
in the Mexican stock exchange. This means that the 10 per cent limit on unit
trust investment in Mexico as an an unapproved market has been lifted.
SIB said it took the decision in response to requests from a number of fund
managers.
One was Martin Currie which has two unit trusts with a Mexico weighting of
9.5 per cent - its international growth fund and an emerging markets fund.
'We are delighted it has happened,' said Alan Maidment, of Martin Currie
Unit Trusts and chairman of the regulations committee of the Unit Trust
Association.
'The argument has been that Mexico is well-regulated, big and efficient and
it was illogical to have a restriction when other markets such as Portugal,
which is tiny and not well-developed, had approval,' he said.
The way into Mexico for most investors will be diluted. Investing directly
in Mexican stocks is only for the very wealthy with a firm conviction that
the market will continue to perform superlatively in the future.
There are few single country funds and most of these, such as Mexican
Horizons, an investment trust managed by John Govett, are geared to the
institutional market. Latin American Securities manages an open-ended fund,
listed in Luxembourg and investing solely in Mexico. Minimum investment is
Dollars 5,000. Schroders has two Mexico funds which are quoted on the New
York stock exchange.
However, most private investors are likely to be better off spreading their
risk between Mexico and other countries through a regional, or an emerging
markets fund. Barings has a closed-end investment company, called the Puma
fund, launched in March 1991 which is run in Boston and is quoted on the
London Stock Exchange. It specialises in Latin America and its Mexico
weighting is around 40 per cent although this proportion can drop if stocks
in neighbouring countries look more attractive.
'Most of the leading Mexican companies are expecting very strong continuing
growth in earnings and that does not include the North American Free Trade
Area', said Maurice de Bunsen, director of Barings. Investment is easier
thanks to the availability of information about its companies.
One blot on the horizon is the size of Mexico's trade deficit which
increased from Dollars 3bn in 1990 to Dollars 11bn last year. However, de
Bunsen said much of this is due to the purchase of capital goods which are
necessary for the regeneration of industry.
The main growth sectors are construction and retail, both of which are
fuelled by a credit boom, according to Federico Laffan, Mexican analyst at
Latin American Securities. Its Latin American investment trust grew by 64
per cent in the year to May 1 but its Mexico weighting has dropped because
of better opportunities elsewhere.
The industrial sector has been affected by the recession in the US. Around
70 per cent of Mexico's imports and exports go through its giant neighbour
and depressed prices for steel, chemicals and other industrial products has
hit the sector.
While the stock market is still expected to perform well this year, the
volume of new issues is causing concern. The market rose by 30 per cent in
the first two months this year and hit an all time high last week but
performance was flat in-between.
'Mexico is driven by foreign investment and the volume of new issues, which
have been great, are being digested by the market,' said Laffan. 'We are
bullish in the medium to long term but for the moment we think the market
will be flat and are keen not to have too much exposure.'
Robert Davey, fund manager of Schroders Latin American Fund, agreed but said
the market is still undervalued. The prospective price-earnings ratio is
only 12.5 and earnings growth is expected to be 25 per cent. Davey has
increased the Mexico weighting which stands at 36 per cent.
The new issues have improved the liquidity of the market but most foreign
investment is still concentrated in the larger companies.
Some fund managers are therefore looking forward to the flotation of smaller
companies as a way of getting into a greater number of sectors. 'The future
of Mexico has to be what it is doing domestically and that means offers from
the the second line Mexican companies will be significant,' said James
Fairweather, who manages Martin Currie's emerging markets unit trust.
His outlook is bullish. 'We think the outlook for the economy in 1993 will
be very good. It is still undervalued and there is a great deal of
opportunity in fast growing companies.'

Welsh Water, which attracted unwanted attention last year with results well
ahead of expectations, should on Thursday announce a more muted pre-tax rise
of less than 10 per cent to about Pounds 140m for the year to March. On
Wednesday, Northumbrian Water, smallest of the 10, is expected to show the
most progress with a 25 to 30 per cent increase in pre-tax profit to Pounds
60m. However, this represents a rebuilding of margins after some heavy costs
in its first year, rather than a surge to a new level.
The two dairy groups Unigate and Northern Foods are reporting annual profits
on Tuesday and Wednesday respectively.
These figures will see Unigate's profits beginning to rise again, if only
because it has sold loss-makers such as its chicken business. Analysts are
looking for around Pounds 90m pre-tax against Pounds 75.5m, although there
will be little underlying growth. Northern should continue to see the
benefits of heavy investment Profit forecasts centre on Pounds 125m pre-tax,
up from Pounds 105.4m.
Analysts do not know what to forecast for Pilkington, the glass group, as it
has Pounds 30m to Pounds 35m of exceptional costs to cover redundancies and
the restructuring of the head office. If all these costs are taken in the
year to end March pre-tax profits could be as low as Pounds 70m, against
Pounds 151.6m.
Racal Electronics, which announces annual results on Wednesday, has twice
forecast profits of about Pounds 50m pre-tax for the year to end-March,
against a Pounds 21.8m loss last time. That return will be after exceptional
provisions of about Pounds 30m for redundancies. The main interest is likely
to be in details of the Chubb demerger. Vodaphone will be questioned closely
on how it plans to cope with lower-priced competitors in telecoms when it
announces annual profits on Tuesday. Analysts expect pre-tax profits of
about Pounds 267m, compared with Pounds 245m.

<TEXT>
MANY European financial markets were thrown into a state of confusion this
week by Denmark's vote against the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty on
closer European integration.
Tuesday's referendum result - showing a slim majority against ratifying the
treaty - sent some of the high-yielding government bond markets reeling,
particularly the gilts market, and the Spanish, Italian, French and Ecu bond
markets. The UK, German and French stock markets also reacted negatively to
the news, falling back initially although economists say the reaction was
based more on the initial shock than a measured response. Many investors
face even more confusion when choosing European bonds and equities.
The sharp fall in the European bond markets stems from the fact that hopes
of a falling inflation rate and lower interest rates have been dashed, at
least temporarily.
The higher-yielding European bond markets attracted money from investors
because of the convergence theory: investors expected economic and monetary
union to force inflation and interest rates in Europe to fall to the levels
seen in Germany. Since bond prices rise as interest rates fall, investors
stood to make substantial capital gains in those countries where interest
rates were expected to fall towards German levels.
However, Denmark's vote has thrown the bond markets into confusion. Those
investors who hold European government bonds either directly or indirectly -
via a global fixed income fund - will have seen a sharp fall in bond prices
this week and some of the markets could drop further.
The main beneficiary of the uncertainty has been Germany: investors rushed
to the safety of the D-mark and German government bond prices showed a
modest rise after the referendum result. For the time being, many economists
feel that the only European government bonds which they can safely recommend
are those in the D-mark bloc, in other words, German, Dutch and Belgian
bonds.
While both the French and the UK government bond markets suffered sharp
falls this week, economists point out that these markets should see some
signs of recovery. The problem is that France has now decided to hold its
own referendum on Maastricht, and this could unsettle the French bond market
in future.
The traditionally high-yielding markets such as Italy and Spain will appear
far less attractive to investors especially if the governments in these
countries come under less pressure to meet convergence criteria.
Investors are also worried that Denmark's action could prompt a realignment
within the Exchange Rate Mechanism of the European Monetary System, with
higher-yielding currencies (such as the Italian lira and Spanish peseta)
facing a hidden devaluation.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: A measured dose of realism /
Studying the lessons from the investment ombudsman's report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INVESTMENT ombudsman's annual report, published this week, administered
doses of common sense for clients and salesmen.
Complaints decreased slightly - from 89 to 67 - in the year to end-March but
compensation paid out rose from Pounds 22,655 to Pounds 114,272. The largest
amount was Pounds 25,031, up from Pounds 8,715 last year. About half the
cases were resolved in favour of the complainant.
Richard Youard, the ombudsman, pin-pointed some problems. He found no
evidence of bad faith but plenty of misunderstanding, caused by several
factors. His long-term solution is education.
He said: 'Greater public awareness of the basic aspects of investment would
significantly reduce the number of cases. Continuing public education is
needed. Fear of the unknown is still a predominant reason for the public not
to invest as they should in their own interests.'
In many cases, investors had unreasonable expectations or did not understand
equity risk, even though it had been well explained to them. If the markets
go down, the ombudsman will not step in when unit trust prices also go down.
He is also highly unlikely to step in when a company underperforms despite
its best efforts. Investors can complain - but cannot expect compensation.
As Youard put it: 'They (the company) got it wrong but they weren't
negligent.'
There was, however, one case where redress was made after exceptionally bad
performance. The complainant had put in around Pounds 80,000 which declined
20 per cent over three years while the market in which it was invested rose
by around a third. In a letter, the company had assured the client it would
do better than an alternative in fixed interest securities. Thanks to this
implied guarantee, the institution involved eventually had to pay out
'around Pounds 10,000.' But Youard emphasised that this case was highly
unusual.
Youard is more bothered by the poor notes taken by intermediaries when
interviewing clients. Normally, a simple fact-find is used: the intermediary
sits down with you and takes down the necessary details. Many companies now
produce standardised forms for this.
But Youard says: 'We still see far too many cases where the fact-find has
been carried out in such a slovenly manner than no one afterwards can say
with any reliability what the customer asked for and what the investment
adviser thought his duty was.'
One successful complainant was a woman aged 82 without dependants. She had
sold her house and wanted to look after her retirement. But there was no
evidence that her 'adviser' had asked about any of this in the fact-find. He
guided her into an unsuitable long-term growth investment.
Youard questioned the idea of salesmen working as advisers. 'It is quite
possible for a salesman to be a salesman and an adviser at the same time but
it is difficult and, because a salesman instinctively sells, things can go
wrong.'
He also found fault with cost disclosure for unit trust products, a live
issue at present as the Securities and Investments Board has yet to decide
on new rules to follow the disclosure rules on life assurance. The Unit
Trust Association is also planning reforms to pricing.
The ombudsman claimed the present 'health warning' for unit trusts - which
says the price of units can go down as well as up - was misunderstood and
should be given greater prominence. He said: 'What, in my view, is required
as a matter of urgency is the abandonment of the present warning and its
substitution in a prominent form by such words as 'you may get back less
than you invested'.'
He found that the 'bid/offer' price spread for unit trusts also was
misunderstood. Three prices are offered for unit trusts. One is the
cancellation price, which is technical. The others - which are likely to be
more important - are the 'offer' and the 'bid' prices. The former is the
price at which investors can buy; it is greater than the latter, at which
they sell. The spread between the two allows for management and
administration costs.
Youard said he would be delighted if the expression 'bid-offer spread' was
abandoned forever 'since I have seen far too many cases where it has been
wholly misunderstood by the investor.' As a substitute, he suggested a
simple statement that the cost of the manager's services, expressed either
as an amount of money or as a percentage, would be deducted from the
investment on the first day.
Philip Warland, director-general of the Unit Trust Association, agreed and
said this would This would make sense, as it would, to quote one leading
figure in the unit trust industry, 'remove the last layer of opacity in unit
trust pricing.' Warland added: 'He's pushing against an open door. The UTA
believes that further simplification of pricing is desirable and we are at
the moment consulting our members.'
The investment ombudsman deals with disputes between customers and members
of Imro, the Investment Managers' Regulatory Office.
If you have a complaint about an Imro member, you should talk to the company
and then, if necessary, report it to Imro. Problems which cannot be resolved
at this point will then be passed to the ombudsman. IMRO's free complaints

<TEXT>
DIRECTORS of Tibbett &amp; Britten, the transport and distribution company, have
sold a total of 288,000 shares and a further 200,000 shares held
non-beneficially. The sales were aimed at improving liquidity in the shares,
which have doubled in value over the past 18 months. Vinten Group
shareholders have done every bit as well on a similar time-scale. William
Vinten, a non-executive director of this specialist instrument and mountings
manufacturer, sold 100,000 shares at 281p, leaving himself with 1.4m. The
recent announcement of ACT's final results was greeted favourably by most
commentators. Directors took the opportunity to scale back their holdings,
with the largest individual disposal being made by chairman Roger Foster.
ACT, which used to be called Apricot, has gone from strength to strength
since concentrating on computer software.
Michael Swan was until recently chairman of Merchant Retail Group. Now
deputy chairman, he bought 1m shares at 14.5p. The new chairman, Eric
Kinder, bought 80,000 shares at 15.5p.
Regular readers of this column may recall that Swan sold 500,000 shares at
34.5p in December last year, shortly before they collapsed on the back of a
profits warning. Another Merchant Retail director also sold 500,000 shares
at around the same time.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: Options that can ease the burden
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OPTIONS for school fees planning grow narrower as your child grows
older. You also have less choice if you lack the luxury of capital and have
to pay out of income. Independent advice is essential, but the following
guidelines to possible products should help.
10 years before school starts
From income: Unit or investment trust savings schemes can be used,
preferably held in a Pep (personal equity plan). Prices can go down as well
as up, a disadvantage when aiming at a fixed sum, but over 10 years you
would be unlucky not to make significant real growth. No income or capital
gains tax is payable.
With-profits endowments have the advantage of a 'sum guaranteed,' which
allows you to aim at a fixed target for fees with some confidence. But they
are much less flexible - you must pay the premiums for at least 10 years to
get a full return - and lack the full tax efficiency of Peps. A mixture of
the two, slanted towards Peps, might be judicious.
From capital: 'Composition' schemes are a possibility, but only if you are
certain about your choice of school. Some bursars will accept a lump sum and
then invest it in an educational trust. In return, they guarantee you fixed
fees, and so compound interest over a long period and the tax-free
environment of the trust should save a lot of money. But many schemes cannot
be transferred to another school.
Educational trusts, offered by a few insurance companies, are more
attractive if you want to retain flexibility in choice of schools, but the
education of a specific child is not a charitable purpose. Hence, trusts
must be written for the benefit of many children, for education at any
school, and tax rebates from them must not be diverted to the investor. When
the child starts at school, the trust's proceeds buy an annuity to pay the
fees.
Boyton Financial Services suggests zero-dividend preference shares, as they
have a known redemption value at a pre-determined date. They allow more
flexibility than endowment products.
5-10 years before school
From income: Investment solely in equities begins to look ambitious, so
financial consultant Noble Lowndes suggests money should be put into
National Savings, banks or building societies as a supplement to a Pep or
endowment. The first such scheme to which you should go is a Tessa
(tax-exempt special saver account), which pays gross interest if you leave
the capital untouched for five years. Maximum investment in the first year
is Pounds 3,000, and over the five years Pounds 9,000, so you can make
regular savings for a while before hitting the limits.
From capital: Most of the options remain open but, again, as time is drawing
on, a share of cash-based investments might be sensible. Noble Lowndes
further suggests an insurance bond. These have the advantage that you can
withdraw up to 5 per cent of the original capital each year, free of tax,
and the capital build-up can be considerable. But beware of high charges and
commissions on what can be an unwieldy investment.
1-5 years before school
From income: Endowments are no longer a sensible option as they need to be
held for 10 years. Noble Lowndes suggests you might still try unit trusts
but, otherwise, restrict yourself to National Savings, banks and building
societies.
From capital: The balance tips further towards keeping some of the money in
cash-based savings.
Up to 1 year before school
From income: If the costs cannot be contained within your salary, then there
is no choice but to take out a loan. Needless to say, this is a big step. If
you use the Independent Schools Information Service scheme, then there is a
decent range of repayment vehicles. 'Draw-down' loans secured against your
house allow more flexibility than borrowing the full amount in one go, which
would amount to taking out a second mortgage.
From capital: Banks, building societies and National Savings (if the child
will be at school for five years or more) can all play a role. A temporary
annuity might also make sense. You give a lump sum to a life company, which
then pays a guaranteed income for a fixed period (which you should arrange
to be the years the child spends at the school). Educational trusts and
composition schemes can be used, but you have missed the chance to profit
from compound returns.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: Hard arithmetic of school fees - As
the cost of a private education keeps rising, it pays parents to plan ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN big public schools call in debt collectors, you know that fees have
become a problem.
Malvern College's decision to employ a collection agency to approach parents
who had fallen badly behind on their Pounds 9,470 annual fees, said as much
about the problems parents are facing as it did about the school's problems.
Britain's independent education sector faces costs which inflate quicker
than the standard Retail Prices Index. In the process, independent education
will be removed from the reach of even more people - unless they plan their
finances very carefully.
Last year fees rose by an average of 12 per cent, according to ISIS, the
Independent Schools Information Service, following an increase of 12.6 per
cent the previous year. A term at a boys' senior boarding school can cost up
to Pounds 3,600, while an equivalent girls' school can cost Pounds 3,400.
Senior day schools do not come cheaper than Pounds 900 per term.
Meanwhile, the income of many parents fell.
School fees are usually one of the last expenditures a family will give up
in recession, but the figures for attendance at boarding schools, which in
many cases now offer particularly poor value, suggest that some parents are
being forced to make that choice. Numbers of full boarding boys dropped 4.7
per cent last year.
So, if you are convinced that your child needs private education, you will
need to do some clear-eyed financial planning. You do not want to find a
debt collector on your door.
Fortunately this is a last resort for the schools as well. Over the last
year, both the schools, through ISIS, and the government, through new tax
incentives for children's saving, have gone some way to addressing the
problem.
Meanwhile, as fees have grown ahead of the rate of inflation, so the
fee-planning industry has expanded and become more sophisticated.
Accountants offer full school fees plans backed up by powerful computer
software. Last year's budget introduced opportunities for tax-free saving
for children via friendly societies - the maximum is Pounds 18 per month and
investments must be continued for ten years - and National Savings Bonus
Bonds - up to a maximum of Pounds 2,000.
These and other tax-efficient savings products introduced in recent budgets,
underpin the plans, along with tried and tested life assurance products such
as endowments and annuities.
Much of the sophistication is useful. Some is gloss. Beware of elaborate
financial 'packaging'. Accountants Coopers &amp; Lybrand summed this up clearly
in their recent report on school fees planning: 'Most of the schemes which
are marketed as school fees plans are little more than familiar well-worn
investment products 'dressed up' for this purpose. You should always look
beyond the dressing and ask whether a scheme suits your own circumstances
and investment preferences and whether or not you believe it is the best way
of achieving your objectives.'
As the article below demonstrates, options tighten as your children grow
nearer school age, and capital up front will help. Start saving ten years
ahead of time, if you can.
An example provided by Equitable Life shows why. On the assumption that you
wish to pay school fees of Pounds 1,300 per term - about average for a day
school - and that they will inflate at 10 per cent per annum, the total
amount you will pay for six years of education, starting in ten years' time,
is Pounds 85,852. This can be met with a lump sum outlay today into
Equitable's charitable trust scheme of Pounds 26,418.
The longer you wait, the more you will pay. If junior is already about to go
to secondary school, and you cannot afford to pay the fees directly out of
income, a loan is your only chance. This is very much a last resort, but the
new ISIS School Fees Special Reserve Account, which allows you to draw down
loans when needed from the Halifax building society, and offers a variety of
ways to repay the loan, has made it more feasible.
And also, there is no point in stretching your finances any more than you
have to. The most crucial decision when you are looking for value for money
is your choice of school.
The Financial Times produced a survey - The FT Schools 500 - in March this
year, which assessed the performance and fees of almost 500 independent
schools.
One conclusion is that you do not necessarily get what you pay for. There is
almost no relation between a school's performance and its fees.
In some ways this is scarcely surprising - much will depend on the quality
of teaching, and the teachers' pay only varies by a small amount from school
to school. Also, a school's resources are often affected rather more by its
endowment than by the amount of fees coming in. Some rich foundations can
offer excellent facilities for relatively low fees.
If you are only concerned to give your child a sound academic grounding,
some day schools with excellent A-levels and university admissions results
will offer strong value.
But if you are strongly wedded to the concept of boarding schools, and the
'character-building' ethos which goes with them, be under no illusions - it
will be expensive.
For example, King Edward's Birmingham, and King Edward VI High, Birmingham,
which finished first and second in the survey, charge annual fees of Pounds
3,960 and Pounds 3,381 for day boys and girls. Winchester College, one of
the most prestigious schools in the country, which came fourth, charges
day-boys Pounds 8,100 per year. For boarders, annual fees are Pounds 10,800,
the same as Eton, which came seventh.
High overheads make boarding schools an increasingly daunting financial
proposition. In Bristol three day schools - Bristol Cathedral ranked 201st,
Bristol Grammar, which would rank in the top 100, and Queen Elizabeth's
ranked 83rd - all charge between Pounds 3,288 and Pounds 3,327 a year.
Clifton College, a well-known boarding school in the same area, charges
Pounds 7,200 per year for day boys, and Pounds 10,320 per year boarding
fees. It came 198th in the FT survey.
League tables are not everything, and you should look at several schools
carefully. If your priority is to ensure a good academic education and a
sound grounding for further education, you might get it free. A high fee is
no guarantee that the school will provide what you are looking for.
Few choices are more important than your children's education. But the
stakes are now so high, that you should also be sure not to take on any
greater financial commitments than your child truly needs.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Markets: A warm Wellcome from the brokers - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE bandwagon for the largest yet international share offer trundled into
view this week. The sale, which could raise as much as Pounds 4bn, is for up
to 50 per cent of the shares in Wellcome, the British pharmaceuticals group.
The shares are being sold by the Wellcome Trust, the medical charity which
owns a 73.6 per cent stake in the company. The fact that it is selling
should prove no disincentive. Pharmaceuticals companies tend to be poor
dividend payers, and the charity wants to increase its income by broadening
its portfolio. For the investor, pharmaceuticals groups offer capital
growth.
Robert Fleming, the UK merchant bank co-ordinating the sale, spelt out some
of the details this week. The tender period starts on July 6, closing
between two and three weeks later. The offer is available to private
investors, but there are none of the incentives associated with UK
privatisations.
The conundrum posed for private investors is whether this is a good time to
purchase drugs stocks, and if so whether Wellcome is the one to buy.
If history is any guide, the temptation to take the plunge looks
irresistible. Investors who bought Wellcome in the original flotation in
1986 can afford to be smug. Although the stock has fallen from a high this
year of Pounds 11.31 to 945p, the loss was small compared with profits. The
original flotation price was 200p.
Last year pharmaceuticals stocks gave a glittering performance. Since then
the sector has underperformed, particularly in April when US investors
switched out of defensive stocks, such as pharmaceuticals, into cyclical
companies.
Pharmaceuticals companies will undoubtedly enjoy significant earnings
increases over the next few years. But the remarkably rapid growth they have
enjoyed is far from assured. Although demand for products continues to grow,
there is increasing political pressure to control drug prices.
Only this week, the German government announced proposals to freeze drug
prices in the world's third largest market for two years. In Japan, the
world's second largest market, price cuts have become the norm. In the US,
some drugs groups have introduced voluntary price freezes to reduce pressure
from Congress.
Finding objective City advice about Wellcome itself is tricky. Most UK
financial houses are involved in the flotation in some way and some
generally bullish tomes have been produced on the company. There have been
some remarkable about-turns in brokers' sentiment about Wellcome since the
flotation was mooted.
Only one significant institution, County NatWest, is not involved, and its
analysts have not been particularly bullish about Wellcome's long-term
earnings prospects.
Nevertheless, all are convinced of Wellcome's immediate prospects. The
company is the fastest growing among the world's 20 largest pharmaceutical
companies. Sales are likely to continue rising, while there is also plenty
of scope for improving margins.
On the revenue side, sales of Zovirax, the group's herpes treatment, are
expected to grow 20 per cent to Pounds 820m by 1994. Annual sales of
Retrovir, the anti-HIV medicine, could reach Pounds 340m within two years.
On the margin-side, John Robb, Wellcome's chief executive, expects
improvements. Margins have improved from 15.7 per cent in 1987 to 24.6 per
cent last year. Robb has promised to reach a target of 30 per cent by 1996.
Pharmaceuticals stocks are notoriously volatile, liable to react violently
to barely comprehensible technical news. Over the next few weeks, as the
flotation approaches, Wellcome, with its narrow public shareholder base of
25 per cent, will prove no exception.
If its price continues to drop, the flotation could be worth a look. Under
the flotation rules, investors applying early will have more chance of
receiving their full allocation. They will need steel nerves.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Markets: A voice that cried 'halt' - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS A week when a small group of worried voters, battered by non-stop
television and newspaper debate, plucked up their courage and cried 'stop'
to the juggernaut of history.
This plucky handful was not the anti-Maastricht Danes but the members of the
Lloyds Bank board, who on Friday decided to drop out of the bidding for
Midland Bank.
Enough was enough, they said: the rival bidder, Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation, by upping its offer earlier in the week, had set a
price that Lloyds could not meet without threatening its shareholders'
interests. So Lloyds dropped out of an auction it had never formally
entered.
Shareholders in Midland have seen the price of the bank's shares rise from
around 250p earlier this year, before Hongkong Bank announced its thinking,
to 452p on Tuesday immediately after it raised its bid. The new, final,
offer was the equivalent of 480p, of which 65p could be taken in cash. In
the following days, the market price rose, in anticipation of a counter-bid
from Lloyds of over 500p.
It never came: on Friday afternoon Lloyds announced it was dropping out. The
share price immediately fell from 468p to 446p.
Only the Hongkong bid, which closes on June 25, remains on the table.
Institutional shareholders, unhappy with the original offer of shares and
bonds, were somewhat mollified by the second version. It now contained 1.2
HSBC shares (themselves worth more than before, because of the strong
performance of the Hong Kong stock market). The non-share element was also
more attractive: 65p in a higher-yielding bond, or the equivalent in cash
provided by a syndicate of underwriters.
Other things being equal, institutional investors would still have preferred
a bid from Lloyds, with its potential cost-savings. Now that possibility has
vanished, investors have a simple choice.
On the one hand, they are offered a chunk of cash, an immediately higher
dividend, and the future benefits of the bidder's stream of Hong Kong
profits; on the other, the undiluted impact of Midland's possible sharp
recovery in earnings. The Midland board, despite a few lingering sighs, is
firmly convinced of the advantages of a bird in the hand; investors are
likely to come to the same conclusion.
Meanwhile, the financial markets have been adjusting to the impact of the
Danish factor. With economic and monetary union called into question, gilt
yields move up after the Danish vote: by the end of the week, the benchmark
gilt was yielding 9.1 per cent, compared with just under 9 per cent a few
days before.
Shares fell too, following the stock market's conventional valuation
arithmetic: higher yields on gilts make the existing dividend yield on
shares less attractive, so share prices adjust downwards to compensate. As
the chart shows, the ratio between gilts and shares has in any case been
heading upwards since the beginning of June, making shares look relatively
dearer.
That calculation partly explains the distinct note of caution detectable in
brokers' circulars this week. They leave the reader with a clear sense that
the market, which dipped below 2,700 on the FT-SE index this week, is likely
to hover around or below that mark for some time.
Maastricht worries reinforce that case. European interest rates have been
dominated by the convergence theory for the past few years: the belief that
inflation and economic performance across Europe were coming into line with
those of Germany. Two propositions underlay that convergence: the belief
that it made economic sense; and the belief that it was politically
unavoidable. Of these, the second certainly carries more weight as a
motivator of politicians' actions.
The Danish vote has called the second proposition into question, and thus
placed a much greater strain on the politicians' commitment to the first.
This week, the markets have been demonstrating their scepticism about just
how well that commitment can take the strain. Italy, with a political class
particularly vulnerable to scepticism, has had to raise interest rates a
half-point.
Even Britain, with a newly-elected government, has seen the backwash. The
pound briefly touched the bottom of the ERM for the first time since the
election. It closed second from bottom on Friday, having dropped two
pfennigs to DM 2.9150 since the Danish vote.
It is not clear whether the Danish factor has produced a one-off adjustment
in expectations, now past, or whether it opens a period of prolonged
uncertainty which will leave its mark on UK markets for months to come. In
support of the second theory is the view that government borrowing will mop
up any institutional liquidity for the foreseeable future, so that UK shares
and bonds are very dependent on inflows of overseas capital. This will be
particularly necessary if the unexpectedly meagre flow of rights issues
resumes in full force, as Thursday's Blue Circle's request for Pounds 241m
to pay for an acquisition, suggests it might.
Italy's problems are thus directly relevant to Britain, if the markets start
to fear that they may culminate in an EMS realignment. In such a
realignment, only a particularly strong-minded British prime minister would
be able to resist the temptation of a sterling devaluation - especially if
he is trapped in the middle of what is likely to prove at best a patchy
economic recovery.
John Major might be that man: but until it is clear that he is, overseas
investors are likely to find British securities less attractive than before
the Danish vote. Of course, UK share prices may be less dependent on
overseas investors just now than the pundits think. It would all be a lot
easier, no doubt, if the government did not need to sell quite so many
gilts.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Markets: Homes that fail to hold their value - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OLD adage 'safe as houses' has taken on an altogether different meaning
in the present property recession. And 'negative equity' is entering the
vocabulary of home-owners to whom it once probably meant nothing.
The persistence of the recession has meant that both owners and lenders are
facing a situation in which the value of a home is less than the amount
borrowed to pay for it. For the first time in decades, some owners are - as
well as seeing their equity disappear - facing a net liability because of
the decline in prices since autumn 1988.
How many are affected? The Council of Mortgage Lenders estimates there are
278,000 'negative loans' taken out by first-time borrowers. These are
concentrated heavily in the south-east, where prices rose faster and higher
than in other part of the country at the peak of the market - only to fall
almost as spectacularly during its downswing. But a report by broker UBS
Phillips and Drew regards this figure as an under-estimate and calculates
that the number of owners affected is just over 1.8m, if second-time buyers
and those who have re-mortgaged their homes are included.
Most owners regard their homes as an investment as well as a place to live.
And property was a particularly good investment for a generation of them
during the three periods of high inflation, in 1972-73, 1978-80 and 1986-88.
They gained tax relief on mortgage interest payments while the real value of
their debt was being eroded by inflation, which outstripped mortgage rates
(real interest rates were negative).
Some people seek reassurance in the view that property values will recover
as they have done in previous economic cycles. But Britain's entry into the
European exchange rate mechanism has cast serious doubts on such
conventional wisdom. The UK is entering a new era in which the old
assumptions may no longer hold good but - as Tuesday's referendum in Denmark
showed - a new conventional wisdom has yet to be established.
The two house price booms at the beginning and end of the 1970s were
followed by periods of high inflation and low or negative real interest
rates which eroded debt and sustained property values. The surge in the
residential property market in 1988 was helped by a drop in mortgage rates
from 14 per cent in 1985 to 9.8 per cent in June 1988 plus the willingness
of some lenders to extend loans for 100 per cent of a home's value.
By contrast, the discipline of the ERM is expected widely to herald a period
of lower rates of inflation. But interest rates are still high in real terms
and may need to remain firm to combat the remaining inflationary pressures
in the UK or to reflect those elsewhere in Europe. Such a combination of low
inflation rates and firm real interest rates would continue to depress the
housing market.
More immediately, repossessions and negative equity, as well as lack of
confidence by potential first-time buyers, have stalled a recovery. The
government's statement this week that it would re-introduce stamp duty after
August 19 has been a further blow.
Mortgage-to-rent schemes, which were part of the same package assembled
hastily in December in an attempt to shore-up the market, have helped so few
families that lenders were called in by the government this week to explain
why.
Nevertheless, few analysts expect the market to remain weak. Steven Bell at
Morgan Grenfell, the merchant bank, which is producing a study of the
housing market, believes there will be a gradual recovery and that when
prices do take off, they will do so rapidly. But he doubts if housing bought
for investment will be able to outperform the returns available on such
deposits as tax-exempt special savings accounts (Tessas), now and in the
near future, because of high real interest rates.
Those who have the luxury of choosing property only as an investment will
have to weigh the odds carefully. This is not a choice available to those
whose houses are worth less than they paid for them. Yet, even they can take
comfort from John Wriglesworth, author of the UBS report.
He manages to see negative equity in positive terms and argues that owners'
inability to sell is just as well since the market needs buyers, not
sellers. Once the 600,000 people who would have been first-time buyers over
the past three years overcome their lack of confidence and enter the market,
prices will rise gradually. Then, he says, negative equity will make a
welcome departure from the owner's vocabularly.
None of this will console those who are struggling to keep up repayments
they can barely afford, or who need a larger home as their families increase
in size. But, for the time being, sit tight is still the best advice.

launches
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Two companies are launching pension products with innovative charging
structures. Irish Life is offering clients a single investment contract for
pension planning, which is aimed at cutting charges. Units in the plan can
continue to accumulate, with no switching charge, between personal pension
plans, additional voluntary contributions and executive pension schemes.
This makes the policy more portable and eliminates problems with transfer
values.
Foster &amp; Braithwaite is launching a personal pension plan with three funds -
cash, a managed fund, and investment trusts - in a scheme administered by
Provident Life. Units in the fund will have no bid-offer spread, again
easing many of the difficulties with transfers. Maximum initial commission
for intermediaries is 20 per cent, with a management charge of 2 per cent
and a Pounds 4 per month policy charge. IFAs will be paid  1/2 per cent of
the value of the fund thereafter.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Finance and the Family: At a glance - Unit trusts find
favour
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The result of the UK general election and the higher limit for unit trust
Peps led to the highest sales of unit trusts for 12 months in April,
according to the Unit Trust Association. Total sales were exactly Pounds
1bn, while the total number of unit trust accounts held rose for the first
time since June 1990.
Funds under management grew to Pounds 59.36bn, the highest figure since
October, up from Pounds 55.98bn in March, and aided by strong stock market
performance. Increased demand for Peps also helped - about 230,000 new unit
trust Peps were opened in the last three weeks of April, while net
investment, at Pounds 151m, was the most on record for any month since sales
of Peps began.

UK house prices increased last month, according to figures released by the

The Nationwide index showed a marginally higher increase than the Halifax,

that this is a sign of a general, sustainable improvement.'

FT  06 JUN 92 / Markets: Sheriff Warren rides into the sunset - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIFE IS rarely dull on Wall Street, but this week managed to pack in a
little more excitement than usual.
The chapter on one financial scandal was closed when Warren Buffett stepped
down as chairman of Salomon on Wednesday, only for the first pages of a
fresh scandal elsewhere on Wall Street to be turned 24 hours later when
seven leading businessmen were charged by the Securities and Exchange
Commission with running an insider trading ring during the late 1980s.
On top of that, on Monday we had the Dow Jones index finally breaking
through the much-touted 'psychological' barrier of 3,400, and on Friday the
markets got a shock in the shape of an unexpectedly disappointing May
employment report, which made President Bush's comments on television the
night before about an 'anaemic' recovery disturbingly prescient for a
rattled Republican party.
The employment numbers were well outside market forecasts. No one predicted
any change in the all-important unemployment rate, but it actually rose in
May from 7.2 per cent to 7.5 per cent.
Although analysts were quick to point out that the increase reflected a rise
in the number of people signing on to look for work (and, therefore, a
revival of confidence in the outlook for job prospects), and that
manufacturers were responding to strengthening demand by boosting working
hours rather than payrolls, the report must have made grim reading at the
White House breakfast table.
In simple terms, the headline-grabbing jump in the unemployment rate, and
the modest 68,000 rise in non-farm jobs, indicate that the economic recovery
is advancing at a snail's pace.
The jobs figures took their toll of stock prices, sending the Dow 20 points
lower by midday yesterday, and taking the index even further away from the
heralded 3,400 level it had managed to breach just four days earlier.
That triumph provoked little celebration on the Street. The initial spark
for Monday's record-breaking 16.33 leap in the Dow to 3,413.21 was a bullish
national purchasing managers' report, but there was not much enthusiasm
behind the market's rise, evidenced by the low trading volume that day of
only 180m shares.
Since then volume has picked up nicely - breaking 200m shares for three days
in a row - but prices have not, with the daily total of falling stocks
consistently outnumbering the total of rising stocks. Moreover, much of the
buying has been restricted to a few cyclical sectors, most notably auto
manufacturers.
Thus, (it has been said before, but is worth saying again) the fact that
other indices have languished while the Dow has edged to record highs
suggests investor confidence in the outlook for equities is thinly spread.
The Standard &amp; Poor's 500, the best measure of the broader market, started
the year at 417, yet was closing out this week around 413 - hardly an
inspiring performance. Likewise the Nasdaq composite index of
over-the-counter stocks, which opened 1992 at 586 and has advanced since
then by no less than one point.
An awareness of how the rest of the market is faring helps put the
performance of the Dow in context. Wall Street tags the word 'psychological'
on nice round numbers like 3,400 because it is believed that once a market
has made it past a notable point, investors say: 'Wow, that was easy, let's
keep going.'
Such thinking is flawed. The evidence of the past month, when the Dow has
flirted with 3,400, broken it, then dropped smartly back, suggests 3,400 is
no more important than 3,399, or 3,401.
At least Salomon and a new insider trading scandal provided a nice diversion
from number-watching. Although sheriff Warren Buffett has now ridden off
into the sunset, he left his deputy behind, top trouble-shooting lawyer
Robert Denham, to make sure Salomon stays on the right side of the law this
time.
The law, meanwhile, was busy concluding a long investigation by charging a
few notables with insider trading. Allegedly involved in the scheme were a
member of the family that founded the cosmetics giant Revlon and a former
director of Wall Street broking house Bear Stearns who married a Ford
heiress and starred prominently in the New York social scene.
The lawsuit against the men, which includes allegations that inside
information was swapped on luxury yachts in the Caribbean and at parties in
Long Island mansions, will be heard later this year.
Monday       3413.21  + 16.33
Tuesday      3396.10  - 17.11
Wednesday    3406.99  + 10.89
Thursday     3399.73  -  7.26

FT  06 JUN 92 / The peace that bypasses all understanding: Twenty-five years
after Israel seized Arab Jerusalem in the Six-Day War, Hugh Carnegy walks
through the Holy City and finds that old hatreds die hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'Pray for the peace of Jerusalem: They shall prosper that love thee. Peace
be within thy walls, And prosperity within thy palaces.'
 - Psalm 122
JUST down the hill from my house in Jerusalem, past the Greek Orthodox tomb
of St Simeon, stands a low stone villa set in a shady garden. It is one of
few in San Simon, as the locals call the area, that have not been knocked
down and replaced by a big block of flats. The Jewish family which lives in
it fills the clay flower pots on the steps brimful with scarlet geraniums.
A mile or so away, in the Old City, I know a woman who says the house is
hers although she has not lived in it for 44 years. Mrs Joanna Ninos  - then
Joanna Zaphiriadis - fled with her father and mother during the battle of
San Simon in 1948, one of the bloodiest in the struggle between a nascent
Israel and Arab forces for control of the Holy City. The Zaphiriadis family
was among many from the 'Greek colony' cut off from their homes after the
1949 truce that left Jerusalem divided by the Green Line, the tangle of
barbed wire and concrete which split the city into Israeli and Arab halves
until 1967. By then, when the Green Line was felled by a triumphant Israel
in the Six Day War, their houses were occupied by Israelis. Attempts to
recover them, or gain compensation, have come to nothing.
The melancholy little villa was a poignant place to start my walk through
the city, reflecting on the changes wrought by the 25 years which have
passed since the most recent of the many conquests in its long history. It
was on June 7 1967 that Israeli paratroopers swept down from the Mount of
Olives, burst into the Old City and completed the capture of all Jerusalem
from the Jordanians, who were foolish enough to provoke the assault by
shelling across the Green Line two days before. But that elusive 'peace of
Jerusalem' did not follow - something brought home by a sign in fluorescent
paint pointing to a neighbourhood miklat, or air-raid shelter, close to the
little villa.
In Jerusalem, the festering enmities of the Arab-Israeli conflict come
together in a cocktail of territorial, religious and historical rivalries.
No political settlement in the Middle East will be complete without some
settlement in the Holy City; and without that, the world will not be free of
the threat of a conflict exploding into war, as it did in 1967.
Cynics might say the Israeli conquest was just one more in a line going back
many centuries. But, looking south from San Simon to the rocky ridge that
divides Jerusalem from Bethlehem, you can see dramatic evidence of one
difference that marks out the Israelis from previous conquerors. They did
not destroy, they built. Where once there were olive groves, ranks of
apartment blocks march down the hillside. They mark Gilo, one of the
fortress-like suburbs the Israelis have built on captured land.
But I am walking in the other direction, towards the walled Old City, the
heart of Jerusalem, where I am going to visit Dr Nick Ninos, son of Joanna.
My way takes me down Emek Rafaim, a busy street that is the hub of a once
predominantly Arab area now inhabited mainly by secular Israelis. The
elegant Arab houses that make this neighbourhood so attractive have few, if
any, Arabs living in them.
There is one Arab shop on the street, the Diplomat butchery with its
prominent 'non-kosher' sign, where elderly Ashkenazi (or European) Jewish
women drop in to buy a little forbidden schinken (ham). Further along, a
bedouin woman sits cross-legged on the pavement selling fresh vine leaves
and mint. But even an area with a liberal reputation such as this does not
break through the new, invisible green line that the Palestinian intifada,
the four-year-old uprising against Israeli rule, has once again built
through the city.
From Emek Rafaim, it is a short step past the railway station to the brow of
the Hinnom valley. Here, perhaps, Jerusalem is at its most beguiling. Across
the deep valley, along which the old Green Line used to run, sits the Old
City, its walls stretched out atop banks of dark green rosemary. On the near
side, gardens of roses and honeysuckle have been laid out around Yemin
Moshe, a picturesque jumble of stone houses founded as the first Jewish
settlement outside the city walls by Sir Moses Montefiore, the 19th century
British philanthropist.
In these parks, it is easy to believe in Jerusalem as an extraordinary
mosaic, not just of the Jewish, Christian and Moslem faiths but of cultures,
too. Where else can Hebrew, Arabic, English, Armenian, Greek, French,
Russian, Amharic and other languages be heard commonly? 'Shalom,' says an
elderly man as I pass. 'Hello, mister, how are you?' shouts an impish Arab
boy. Arabs and Jews both stroll in the Hinnom gardens. But not together.
And, across the wadi, reality is waiting.
Inside the Old City, belted since the 16th century by sturdy walls build by
Suleiman the Magnificent, the Ottoman sultan, the atmosphere is transformed.
Tourists jostle in the alleyways leading from the Jaffa Gate. Cheerful Arab
merchants hawk Palestinian and Jewish souvenirs. 'Of course - it's
business,' laughs one as he sells me a kippa, a Jewish skullcap which I must
wear to visit a rabbi later. Very few of his customers are Israeli, however.
Apart from the Jewish quarter, the Old City is predominantly an Arab town
into which few Israelis venture for fear of an intifada knife in the back.
Those that do are the well-armed men of the Border Police, a paramilitary
force deployed heavily in the Old City and feared by many Palestinians for
its brutality, So, also, do the bands of Jewish religious zealots in the Old
City who recently have stepped up their provocative drive to move into the
Arab areas, upsetting the fragile status quo. No Arab is allowed to do the
reverse in Jewish districts. These settlers, as they are called, scurry
through the crowded Arab markets clutching their guns and the crackling
walkie-talkies they use to summon aid if they are attacked.
I turn into the Christian quarter, focus for the 30-odd Christian sects
represented in Jerusalem but dominated by the Greek Orthodox, Greek Catholic
and Latin Catholic churches which have the biggest local Arab congregations.
Within earshot of the sonorous bells of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre,
hunched over Calvary and the tomb of Jesus, I climb the steps up to Nick
Ninos's surgery in a characteristic Old City building of cool stone and high
ceilings.
His family came to Jerusalem a century ago. His late father, a dentist like
himself, remembered watching General Allenby entering the Jaffa Gate when
the British ousted the Turks in 1917. He and Vivica, his Greek-Palestinian
psychiatrist wife, live with their three young children in a small house
tucked in behind one of the Old City's narrow streets. It looks rather
idyllic; but the tensions of living here, and the lack of prospects, make
them contemplate leaving as thousands of Jerusalem's dwindling Christian
community have already left - Nick's two brothers among them.
'We are the only Greeks left with children the age of ours,' says Nick. 'We
are among the romantic Greeks here. There is something that keeps us here. I
am very traditional. I had my children baptised in the Jordan river - even
in December. I feel this is my home. But maybe we are too romantic. My kids
speak Greek but there are no other children for them to talk to in Greek.
Maybe we will have to go.'
No doubt Teddy Kollek, the mayor of Jerusalem since the 1967 war, would
encourage them to remain. His office, in the still bullet-pocked
municipality building, lies just outside the Old City, a short walk from
Ninos's clinic. Aged 81, Kollek is an abiding symbol of liberal Zionism who
insists that Jew and non-Jew can live together in Jerusalem. The city's
surviving physical beauty owes much to his efforts.
He admits, though, that he fears he is 'swimming against the stream.' His
vision of Arabs and Jews living in respectful harmony is hard to sustain in
the face of the intifada and the gun-slinging settlers. 'Our task is not to
try by some Messaianic urge to drive out Christians and Moslems,' Kollek
says angrily about the settlers.
It could be that demographics also are against Kollek. Under the Israelis,
the population of Jerusalem has doubled from 268,000 in 1967 to 545,000 now
 -72 per cent of it Jewish, perpetuating a Jewish plurality that has held
since late Ottoman times. That pleases the mayor, who wants to consolidate
Israel's claim to sovereignty over all the city. But Arab growth rates are
faster, and the gap is closing.
In addition, there is a tendency among secular, professional Jews to leave
the city where the Jewish population is becoming increasingly religious.
Haredim 'ultra-orthodox' Jews constitute a quarter of the Jewish population
and are the fastest-growing sector. They are an intriguing, integral part of
Jerusalem in their black hats and long black frock coats, bustling in and
out of their Yeshiva religious colleges.
These trends do not, however, appear to bode well for the 'peace of
Jerusalem.' Political divisions have not been blunted and could sharpen
further as the growing Arab population, which has refused stubbornly to take
Israeli citizenship, becomes more overwhelmingly Moslem and the Jewish
population more strongly religious.
Down the street from Kollek's office, I catch a bus for Jebal Mukaber, an
Arab village on the southern fringe of Jerusalem with a spectacular view of
the Old City and the Mount of Olives. An Arab friend, Amer Abu Solb,
introduces me to his father, a man of 90 who recalls the days when, he says
with some venom, the Turks treated the Arabs like animals.
Abu Amer is a devout Moslem who still goes often to pray at the Al-Aqsa
mosque, the third-holiest shrine in all Islam, in the Israeli-held Haram
al-Sharif. He gives Kollek some credit for his efforts to be fair to Arabs.
But age and experience have not tempered his belief that the Jews have
'taken my country.' He is especially bitter about the tough security the
Israeli authorities impose on the Haram. He does not believe Arabs and Jews
can live in peace. 'No. Because the Jews have different ways and believe in
different things.'
One of the most striking sights in Jerusalem is the dramatic physical
proximity of the Jewish and Moslem holy places. Moslems believe the prophet
Mohammed ascended into heaven on his winged horse from the Haram - the same
spot where the great Jewish temple once stood. The dulled gold of the Dome
of the Rock looms immediately above the massive stone blocks of the Western
(or Wailing) Wall, the original retaining wall of the temple and the Jews'
holiest place.
In this century, much blood has been spilled here. But for centuries before,
Jew and Moslem co-existed in Jerusalem. Even today, the proximity of the two
faiths seems more than physical. As I watched at the end of the day, a group
of Sephardim, or oriental, Jews celebrated a boy's bar mitzvah at the Wall.
A young man beat an eastern rhythm on a small drum. A woman ululated. They
danced in a swaying circle. I have seen Moslem and Christian Arabs celebrate
family occasions in almost identical fashion. Perhaps it is possible that
the people of Jerusalem will one day see what binds them, not what divides
them.

FT  06 JUN 92 / The Long View: Debt and Danegeld
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO MONTHS have passed since John Major gained his unexpectedly clear
election victory. The achievement was enthusiastically celebrated by the
financial markets but economically it appears to have been much less of a
landmark.
Most of the economic news since the election has been negative, with the
exception of a small cut in short-term interest rates and a tiny upturn in
car sales. For the rest, inflation (especially of pay) is running
persistently too high, unemployment is continuing to rise quite fast, and
the balance of payments has deteriorated - giving an advance warning that
any serious recovery in the economy will suck in imports at a disturbing
pace. In fact the national income figures for the first quarter proved
unexpectedly poor, making it appear inevitable that even if the economy
picks up smartly from now on the government's March modest-looking forecast
of 1 per cent growth for 1992 as a whole will prove optimistic.
This shadow over growth prospects has important negative implications for
government borrowing, which will be even higher than at present forecast -
Pounds 28bn for the current financial year - if the economy underperforms.
It is in this respect that the damage the discontented Danes have inflicted
upon the Maastricht Treaty could have its earliest effects. Global bond
investors have until now obtained comfort from the commitment to monetary
union and have been prepared to accommodate a convergence of bond yields
within the context of the European Monetary System. It has become easy - you
might say, far too easy - for European governments to borrow, under the
umbrella (somewhat tattered, but still giving shelter) provided by the
deutschemark. Now the price of being a big borrower could rise further.
Two crises are beginning to loom for the British government. There is a
problem of excessive public spending which will need to be tackled this year
and next. That embarrassment could be regarded as no more than the
conventional price for winning an election. But something more sinister is
developing: an impending weakness within the financial system, highlighted
by the renewed surge of big bankruptcies.
In many respects Britain has an American problem here, but it cannot adopt
the American solution, which has been to cut short-term interest rates
sharply and encourage lending institutions to increase their margins. By and
large (with the exception of Scandinavia) other European countries do not
share this financial solvency problem, so high interest rates are not so
awkward for them. But in Britain the debt keeps mounting in the arrears
accounts of individuals and businesses who cannot afford it. There are
estimated to be anything up to 2m home owners with mortgages bigger than the
value of their houses (although many of them may be perfectly capable of
paying their monthly instalments). Commercial property developers are
rolling up 12 per cent or more on their borrowings each year while the value
of their assets continues to fall, which is a short-cut to Canary Wharf.
So far any institutional failures - such as of minor building societies -
have been covered up (apart from BCCI which was rather different in nature);
but there is an increasing risk that a bigger collapse will appear. If so,
the Government will have to decide whether to finance a bail-out, the kind
of situation in which public spending can get right out of control.
Even if the banks all manage to avoid serious damage they will only do so
behind some sturdy fortifications. So the economic forecasters at the
Treasury, as they tear up yet another failed attempt to predict the
recovery, might ponder on the implications of the banking pressures for the
economy at large. We are seeing a reversal of trends that became evident
when the deregulated lenders were left to run riot in the 1980s. It was,
after all, the decade of the small business sector - which the banks made
into their own territory. Small services businesses mushroomed, and buyouts
boomed as big companies were offered fat bank-financed prices for various of
their offshoots. But the big companies were mostly little affected by the
lending spree except for some in the property sector and those (many of
which are now extinct) which took up huge lines of bank credit in order to
participate in the notorious but fortunately short-lived takeover bubble at
the end of the decade.
Now the credit taps have been mostly shut off. Local bank managers tell
their business clients that they have been ordered by head office to stop
lending; the chairman denies it, but then, perhaps no-one has told the
chairman what is really going on. At any rate, the small business sector is
in for some tough years. Big companies, on the other hand, have direct
access to the still buoyant capital markets, as Blue Circle showed this
week. Bigger buyouts such as Taunton Cider and MFI are coming back to the
stock market. We can expect to see a wave of smaller company flotations over
the next couple of years. But most companies are too small for this to be a
solution, and many others would fail the required tests of financial health.
Anyone worried about the recent track record of his economic model of the
British economy must also do some hard thinking about what sort of engine
might replace the housing market. During the late 1980s anything up to
perhaps Pounds 18bn a year of equity was released from the housing market to
finance other spending as Pounds 30bn or Pounds 40bn each year of net
lending cascaded into residential property. Now, net lending is running at
little more than Pounds 20bn a year and a prime source of finance for
consumer spending has largely fizzled out, for the foreseeable future.
With the political pressure off, John Major has no need to force events. But
the possibility of paying Danegeld interest rates could concentrate his
mind.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Kohl and Major call for rapid enlargement of EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHANCELLOR Helmut Kohl of Germany and Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, called yesterday for a speedier widening of European Community
membership, in spite of Denmark's vote to reject the Maastricht treaty on
European union.
The joint call, issued after informal talks in Bonn, gives German backing to
Mr Major's push for a rapid enlargement of the Community. In particular, the
two leaders called for negotiations with prospective member states from the
seven-nation European Free Trade Area (Efta) to begin at the start of 1993.
It is seen in Bonn as a deliberate effort to play down the significance of
Denmark's referendum result, which threatens to sabotage the Maastricht
agreement on European economic, monetary and political union.
Describing their talks as 'very friendly', Mr Major and Mr Kohl merely
welcomed the outcome of the meeting on Thursday of EC foreign ministers. The
ministers had insisted that the other 11 member states press ahead with
ratification of an unchanged Maastricht treaty by the end of the year, but
leave the door open for Denmark to reconsider its position.
While emphasising the commitment to press ahead with ratification, the two
leaders believe that more work needs to be done on how the Community can
move forward before this can sensibly be discussed by heads of government,
who will meet at the Lisbon summit in three weeks' time.
The UK legislation to ratify the treaty is almost certain not to come back
to the House of Commons before July. This leaves the Westminster parliament
little prospect of completing its consideration in the timescale agreed by
EC foreign ministers. Downing Street yesterday played down the importance of
that timescale, emphasising that it was not a deadline.
Mr Major and Mr Kohl then called for 'speedy initiation and conduct of
negotiations on accession with those Efta states which so desire', urging
the European Commission to produce a negotiating mandate by the time of the
EC summit in Edinburgh in December. In the German text, they called for
'acceleration' of the process.
The move is regarded with suspicion by some member states, including France,
which believe that the 'deepening' of the community via the Maastricht
treaty is an essential precondition. They fear that new members will merely
dilute and delay the integration process. So far, Austria, Finland, Sweden
and Switzerland have applied to join. The other Efta countries are Norway,
Iceland and Liechtenstein.
The UK government's political balancing act over the current uncertainty in
the EC was underlined yesterday. Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, launched
a blistering attack on the European Commission for the 'seemingly endless
and un-questioning pressure from Brussels always to extend the competence of
the Community'.
He emphasised also that the Danish referendum result provided a timely
reminder 'that there is nothing inevitable or predetermined about the future
development of the European Community', and that the UK was not alone in
wanting to protect its national identity.
Mr Lamont's implicit criticism of Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission
president, will strike a chord with many Tory MPs - not just those who have
been consistently Euro-sceptic. He warned that small countries should not be
'bullied or pressurised' and that he could think of nothing more likely to
stir up nationalism and resentment towards the EC than talk of forcing
Denmark out of it.
The rebel Euro-sceptic Tory MPs may take some comfort from Mr Lamont's
words. But they were in no doubt that government whips would over the
weekend reinforce the pressure on MPs to withdraw their names from a
parliamentary motion calling for a 'fresh start' in shaping the EC on
non-federalist lines. Two new MPs have already done so.
At the Anglo-German talks yesterday, Mr Major apparently failed to persuade
Mr Volker Ruhe, the German defence minister, to modify his objections to the
European Fighter Aircraft project. Mr Ruhe did agree to further talks with
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, his British counterpart, before reaching a final
decision. The parties in Germany's ruling coalition are due to decide the
fate of the aircraft on June 23.
The importance attached by Mr Major to keeping the project alive was
underlined by the suggestion that he might try to raise the issue again with
Chancellor Kohl in the margins of meetings at the earth summit in Rio de
Janeiro.
British and German officials are also to have further discussions, which
will include ways in which industry might be persuaded to reduce its costs.
Re-allocating the costs of the programme between the participating countries
does not seem to have been raised as an option.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Moscow on the trail of missing billions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR JULES KROLL, a US investigator who helped trace the missing Marcos
millions, is now on the trail of vast sums of hard currency stashed abroad
by Moscow's former communist regime.
He says the money could be worth more than western aid pledged to the former
Soviet republics.
Mr Kroll, who was also involved in tracking down the assets of Haiti
dictator 'Baby Doc' Duvalier, appealed yesterday for help from central
banks, governments and businessmen to find the money.
At a time when the west was considering giving Russia and the other former
Soviet republics Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13bn) in aid, uncovering the funds
would be 'one of the cheapest forms of aid' it could offer, Mr Kroll said.
Hired by the Moscow government, Mr Kroll has a team of 15 people working
full time tracing the missing money.
His consultancy, Kroll Associates, is hunting for three types of funds:
profits sent abroad illegally by state-owned enterprises; bribes paid by
foreign companies to Russian officials for concluding deals on terms
unfavourable to the state; and public funds transferred abroad by the
now-banned Communist party.
'This is going to require some government-to-government negotiations,' Mr
Kroll said. 'If you leave it to a bank that has possession (of illicit
funds), you're going to have a long wait.'
'We're getting a range of reactions - all the way from the helpful to the
non-responsive.'
The money is believed to be in bank accounts in Cyprus, Greece, Switzerland,
Austria, Germany, the UK, Jersey, the US, and any other countries where
beneficiaries either had 'trusted friends' or 'consultancies'.
'There's no doubt we are talking about billions,' Mr Kroll said, adding that
it was impossible to be precise.
In the four months since his consultancy was hired by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the
Russian first deputy prime minister, it has found 22 bank accounts of a
suspect nature, all set up since 1985, although none of the money has been
retrieved.
Mr Mikhail Gurtovoi, the head of Russia's anti-corruption service, has
evidence of 160,000 people who have illegally transferred money out of the
country.
Mr Kroll and his team are paying special attention to commodity trading  -
particularly that involving imports of agro-industrial products, where
foreign sellers have an unusually high profit margin. They also will be
watching oil-related exports (where foreign buyers have been given
exceptionally cheap deals).
In many cases, Mr Kroll's task will be made easier by the fact that the
state owns many of the entities which have done the crooked deals - avoiding
the barrier of banking secrecy which has been raised in his work for other
countries.
Apart from returning the money to Russia, Mr Kroll also sees his role as
helping with 'preventative medicine' - to cut back such practices in future.
Mr Kroll and the anti-corruption authorities will offer foreign businessmen
a reference service to help them avoid crooks in Russia's corrupt business
environment.
Mr Gurtovoi guaranteed anonymity and help to any company which came forward
with information on bribe-takers.
'We want our country to conduct business in a civilised manner,' he said.

FT  06 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Paris tumbles as Euro Disney
loses ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE APPROACH of another public holiday left northern Europe muted and mixed
yesterday, as it digested this week's 'No' vote in Copenhagen and the French
decision to go on the referendum trail. But Mediterranean bourses were more
clearly depressed, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS took another tumble, but this time it had nothing to do with the
aftermath of the Danish vote. Euro Disney took centre stage as investors
began to sell on almost any excuse, some analysts said. Weakness here fed
through into the CAC-40 which finished 13.29 lower at 1,981.58, although off
the day's low of 1,974.99, for a fall of 2.5 per cent over the week.
The theme park made a number of comments after the close on Thursday which
led to a wave of selling when trading opened: the company said that it did
not expect to make a profit this year and is disappointed at the attendance
figures over the first 50 days.
County NatWest in London has cut its dividend forecast to FFr1.00 from
FFr1.50 and notes that the planned second park has been postponed. A
downgrading of Walt Disney, Euro Disney's US parent, by Morgan Stanley later
in the day only added to the stock's woes and it sank to a year's low of
FFr108.1 before firming a little to close down FFr5.80, or 5 per cent at
FFr109.50 with some 1.7m shares traded.
Other features of the day included Bernard Tapie Finance, up FFr3.50 at
FFr138.50 after a brief suspension in the morning on group net loss for
1991. Geophysique advanced FFr44.00 to FFr684.00 on good first quarter
results and prospects for the year, while Promodes was FFr80.00 firmer at
FFr3,500 following a positive analysts meeting.
FRANKFURT saw some action in second liners as the majors stayed mainly flat.
After a 1.59 gain to 714.27 for the FAZ at midsession, the DAX index closed
3.24 lower at 1,789.07; falls on the week were 1.0, and 0.8 per cent.
Volume fell from DM6.8bn to DM5.6bn, anticipating Monday's holiday.
Linotype, one of the disappointments of 1991, rose another DM17 to DM418 on
higher orders and the indication of a return to the dividend list this year.
Steels rose after a Commerzbank report gave measured, but limited, support
to their cyclical recovery prospects. Preussag rose DM3.60 to DM430.50 and
Klockner-Werke by DM2 to DM126.50.
Berliner Bank, state controlled, rose DM11 to DM290 after the Berlin city
coalition government approved its merger with two other state-owned banks.
MILAN reacted to a rise of half a percentage point in the Bank of Italy's
interest rate on advances to banks. This was followed after hours by a Banco
di Napoli increase of a half a point in prime and top rates, and three
quarters of a point in other rates.
The Naples-based bank is one of Italy's leading commercial banks and its
lead is likely to be followed. Meanwhile, the Comit index fell 5.48 to
487.42 for a loss of 1.8 per cent on the week. Banks and insurances were
weak on the interest rate move but Fiat tried to lead the way down, dropping
L118 to L5,282 before recovering to L5,330 on the kerb.
ZURICH was stirred only by Sandoz, described as particularly undervalued in
a report on Swiss chemicals majors by Mr Jonathan Spink of Williams de Broe.
Sandoz certificates topped the active list and rose SFr90 to SFr2,920 as the
SMI index closed 3.1 lower at 1,918.8, little changed on the week.
AMSTERDAM weakened slightly in spite of encouraging results on Thursday from
KLM and Ahold. The CBS Tendency index closed down 0.1 at 130.5 and was 0.4
per cent lower on the week.
Ahold improved Fl 1.00 or 1.1 per cent to Fl 88.20 following first quarter
results which came out after the close on Thursday. KLM likewise had a
reasonable day, advancing to the day's high of Fl 41.10 before easing to
close up 10 cents at Fl 40.40. Prudential Securities of the US, however, has
cut its rating for the airline group to hold from buy.
Aegon was again active, up 50 cents at Fl 124.20. The insurer has set next
Tuesday for its 2-for-1 stock split. Nedlloyd weakened on options selling,
down 90 cents at Fl 59.50.
BRUSSELS strengthened with trading in Solvay accounting for some 20 per cent
of total volume. The Bel-20 index firmed 1.44 to 1,225.54 but was down 0.6
per cent on the week. Petrofina saw its fourth consecutive fall to close
down BFr75 at BFr10,575 in volume of some 6,140 shares.
MADRID weakened as the market continued to react to the Danish 'No' vote on
the Maastricht treaty. The general index ended down 3.42 to 254.64, a drop
of 2.45 per cent over the week. However, analysts are forecasting lower
inflation data next week which is expected to improve sentiment.
STOCKHOLM featured losses at SE Banken where the A fell SKr2 to SKr33.50,
and the Affarsvarlden General index dropped 5.4 to 974.5 for a loss of 1.7
per cent on the week.
HELSINKI continued to fall in slow trade ahead of the next two weeks' crop
of interim results. The Hex index closed 3.2 lower at 813.7, 2.9 per cent
lower on the week.

FT  06 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Tokyo weathers cold backwash from 1991
 -But the OTC market remains vulnerable to Japan's current economic downturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Japan's current economic downturn has forced companies to report poor
earnings results for the last fiscal year, the Tokyo stock market has
remained calm against the slew of poor earnings announcements during the
past few weeks.
Contrary to previous forecasts of a 5 to 10 per cent growth in earnings for
the year ended March, profits at Japanese companies have been hit by the
sharp decline in demand resulting from a weakening economy, and heavy losses
on securities investments.
According to the Nihon Keizai Shimbun, the business daily, pre-tax profits
for Japan's 1,404 listed companies fell 14.8 per cent. However, share prices
have weathered the spate of poor earnings announcements, and the Nikkei
stock average has managed to restrict its decline to 4 per cent from April.
Ms Kathy Matsui, strategist at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, explains
that profits have become a neutral factor since the bad news has already
been factored into share prices. 'The market turned negative on earnings
concerns at the end of last year,' she adds.
The exceptions have been the traditionally conservative companies posting
losses on speculation in the real estate and stock markets; unwelcome
surprises like these have depressed companies' share prices. 'Investors have
been shocked by solid companies revealing hidden spectres of the stock
market bubble,' says Mr Craig Chudler, strategist at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew in
Tokyo.
Sekisui Chemical, for example, said it would incur an 18 per cent fall in
pre-tax profits for the current year, due to securities losses of Y60bn at
its finance subsidiary. Since its earnings announcement at the beginning of
May, Sekisui's shares have fallen 24 per cent, and closed yesterday at Y840.
Makita, the electric tool maker, posted a 27 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits for the past fiscal year due to heavy losses on its investment
portfolio. The company posted losses of Y5.9bn on its tokkin - or specified
money trust. Makita has lost 10 per cent since its earnings announcement.
A rebound in the economy is expected in the second half of the current
fiscal year to March 1993. However, investors remain confused about
corporate forecasts for the current fiscal year, due to the uncertainty
shrouding the path of the economy.
Ms Matsui at BZW, who foresees a robust pick up in corporate earnings in
fiscal 1993, says that until the direction of the economy can be confirmed,
the corporate profit factor will have little impact on overall share prices.
In contrast, the over-the-counter market has been hit by weak corporate
earnings at Japan's smaller companies. The OTC average has declined 6 per
cent from the beginning of April, as the smaller companies have shown
themselves vulnerable to the current downturn in the economy.
Figures compiled by the Nihon Keizai Shimbun indicate that pre-tax earnings
at OTC companies, which announced results for the year ended March, fell
24.6 per cent from the previous year.
Daily volume, which has been as high as 5m shares at the height of the OTC
market boom in 1990, has also been subdued, with figures teetering around 1m
on most days.
OTC stocks were promoted on their high earnings growth potential, and the
index surged above 3,000 in 1990. However, the market has nearly halved from
those levels, as small companies have had trouble withmounting inventories,
and were affected by the fall in profits at the larger companies.
Pre-tax profits for the OTC steel sector fell 30.1 per cent, while
electronics declined 27.3 per cent and the real estate sector saw a total
pre-tax loss of Y11.3bn.
The OTC market also faces an overhang of supply. Domestic and foreign
investment trusts rushed to set up OTC funds at the height of the market. Mr
Chudler of UBS Phillips &amp; Drew points out that such funds, which sought
shares at overblown prices, now carry heavy losses.
In addition, the oversupply is expected to be aggravated by forthcoming new
listings. The popularity of a recent listing by Ito-en, a tea leaf and
beverage company, is likely to encourage a number of companies which have
been waiting since the end of last year, when new listings were suspended
due to sluggish market conditions.
Last October's implementation of Jasdaq, the automated trading system, has
also hurt the market. The system, which matches and processes orders
automatically through a host computer, has helped remove speculation in
deals previously matched by phone.
Overpriced issues, in what used to be an inefficient market, have ironically
been deflated by the speeding up of transactions and the increase in trading
capacity.
For the current year to March, OTC companies expect pre-tax profits to
recover by 21.7 per cent. However, traders remain pessimistic, as
institutions await to run down their holdings on a rebound.

FT  06 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls in
arbitrage related trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices retreated on arbitrage related selling in thin trading
yesterday, unimpressed by the strong yen and bond prices, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average lost 1 per cent or 174.03 to 17,790.04, 3 per cent lower
on the week. The index opened at the day's high of 17,900.04 and fell to a
low of 17,724.31 in the afternoon. Volume fell to 180m shares from 215m.
Activity was limited to individuals and dealers, institutional investors
remaining inactive before the expiration of June futures contracts.
Declines overwhelmed advances by 683 to 227, with 174 unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks lost 8.14 to 1,345.96 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 1.02 to 1,061.85.
In spite of lingering concern, most analysts expect the futures expiration
and settlements next week to be a 'non-event' due to declining arbitrage
positions. Institutional buying is also expected to absorb the unwinding.
Yesterday saw light index-linked selling, and illiquid component stocks of
the Nikkei 225 index fell sharply. Daito Woolen Spinning &amp; Weaving fell Y24
to Y731 and Shinagawa Refractories by Y13 to Y750.
Fanuc, the machine tool equipment and robotics maker, lost Y110 to Y4,150.
Investors were discouraged by the decision by General Motors of the US to
sell its stake in a joint venture set up with Fanuc.
Trust banks were lower on concerns over bad debts. Mitsui Trust and Banking
fell to a year's low, and closed Y30 down at Y783. The company has extended
loans to several real estate and stock speculators facing financial trouble,
and is involved in restructuring programs of land developers. Mitsubishi
Trust and Banking fell Y30 to Y920 and Sumitomo Trust and Banking declined
Y19 to Y931.
Theme stocks declined as dealers took profits ahead of the weekend. Meiji
Milk Products, the most active issue of the day, fell Y3 to Y928, and Japan
Metals &amp; Chemicals declined Y15 to Y738.
Blue chip electricals lost ground on the lack of foreign support. Sony fell
Y70 to Y4,320 and NEC declined Y18 to Y910.
In Osaka, the OSE average declined by 177.72 to 20,487.66 in volume of 10.6m
shares. Small-lot selling by individuals depressed the index.
Roundup
HONG KONG and Taiwan were closed for public holidays and in any case, said
Mr David Bates of Asia Equity, investors have been looking to lock in their
Hong Kong profits and look for gains elsewhere.
MANILA obliged, rising another 20.48 yesterday to a record closing high of
1,517.21, up 8.4 per cent on the week, partly on anticipation that the
Philippines ex-defence chief, Mr Fidel Ramos, would be proclaimed president
by Congress, which is still tabulating results of the May 11 election.
Turnover jumped from 599m pesos to 741.6m.
JAKARTA's official index rose 2.08 in half-day trading to 315.58, up 5.5 per
cent on the week. Mr Bates observed that the main reason, a percentage point
cut in the base rate, still left Indonesia's base lending rate at 27 per
cent, but that inflation was at single digit level and that more interest
rate cuts were expected to come.
Indonesia and the Philippines, said Mr Bates, were getting their economic
growth through to corporate earnings, unlike Singapore and Malaysia where
equities were been relatively quiet last week.
BANGKOK rallied after a jittery week, the SET index advancing 17.49, or 2.6
per cent to 702.24, 1.9 per cent higher on the week, in reaction to an
opposition decision to nominate Democrat Party leader Chuan Leekpai as a
compromise prime minister.
BOMBAY staged a rebound to close with the BSE index up 81.82 at 3,086.74, up
2.7 per cent on another week of scandal speculation; the week before, it
fell by 12.5 per cent.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Copper
market outlook brightens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTLOOK brightened for copper producers this week as prices on the
London Metal Exchange broke out of the recent narrow trading range to reach
the highest level for seven months in dollar terms.
Declining stocks levels, growing hopes of US economic recovery and the
approach of North American labour contract negotiations combined to push the
LME three months delivery price through resistance at the equivalent of
Dollars 2,260 a tonne early in the week.
After consolidating in the higher range the market was given a further boost
on Thursday by news that Codelco, Chile's state-owned copper corporation,
had been forced by heavy rain temporarily to close the world's biggest open
pit mine at Chuquicamata, which produced more than 200,000 tonnes of refined
copper in the first four months of this year.
In addition the corporation announced the second closure in less than a week
at its Quebrada open pit mine, this time because of heavy snow. The mine
normally accounts for about 20 per cent of the 8,500 tonnes-a-month
production of Codelco's El Salvador division.
The Chuquicamata news came after the LME close on Thursday, but New York
prices surged to life-of-contract highs in response and yesterday morning
the LME three months price climbed to Dollars 2,278 a tonne before running
into Chinese selling.
By the close the price was up Pounds 5.50 on the day and Pounds 18.25 on the
week at Pounds 1,257.75, a tonne, equivalent to Dollars 2,276 a tonne. In
sterling terms that was well below the Pounds 1,335 a tonne reached three
months ago, but sterling was much lower then compared with the US currency
and that price worked out at only Dollars 2,258 a tonne.
The more hopeful mood in the copper market was reflected in this week's
issue of London trader Rudolf Wolff's Copper Outlook news letter. 'The
outlook for copper is one of optimism as the fundamentals are improving and
the technical picture looks bullish,' Wolff said.
'Overall, the improved US economic situation is expected to provide a firm
base to underpin the market. The ongoing shortfalls in supply, especially
with the uncertainty surrounding aspects of CIS production/exports and over
the level of Yugoslavian exports (estimated at around 50,000 tonnes in 1991)
following trade sanctions, should prompt renewed consumer interest. In
addition to the projected supply deficit, growing confidence for economic
recovery in the US and parts of Europe should prompt restocking.'
Despite copper's stronger performance the lead market stole the honours for
the week's biggest rise with a Pounds 13.25, or 4.4 per cent, advance to
Pounds 313.50 a tonne in the three months position. Most of the rise took
place on Thursday and in the absence of fundamental factors was attributed
to investment fund buying, topped up by stop-loss purchases.
In the zinc market the concern about the availability of metal to cover June
options declarations was still evident, although bearish fundamentals were
reflected in an overall downward price trend. The cash price closed
yesterday at Dollars 1,445 a tonne, up Dollars 2.50 on the week, but the
three months price fell Dollars 22 to Dollars 1,262.50 a tonne, widening the
cash premium to Dollars 182.50.
Tin prices reached 20-month highs early in the week on European trade
buying, which also sparked off covering by holders of short positions and
triggered stop loss buying orders. But hopes of breaching resistance at
Dollars 6,500 a tonne for three months metal were disappointed. The price
touched that level on Wednesday before sliding back to Dollars 6,467.50 a
tonne, up Dollars 190 on the week.
Hopes that the coffee market would consolidate the gains made on Friday of
last week were also disappointed. There was no follow-through to that
upturn, which had been prompted by producer members of the International
Coffee Organisation agreeing an, admittedly vague, quota plan for
presentation at the ICO council meeting on June 22-26. The London Futures
and Options Exchange's September position ended the week Dollars 16 down at
Dollars 730 a tonne.
New York sugar futures moved up strongly on Thursday, influenced by
investment fund buying, technical factors and talk of a pick-up in demand
for white sugar on the world market. But the London market response
yesterday was muted. In late trading the October position was at Dollars
216.80 a tonne up 40 cents on the day at Dollars 8.40 on the week.

FT  06 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Blue chips continue to give ground
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER pressures on government bonds and stock index futures drove the UK
equity market below an important support level yesterday, leaving traders
somewhat apprehensive regarding the near term outlook. The market was
dominated by the withdrawal of Lloyds Bank from the contest for Midland, a
development which saw Midland shares fall sharply to an increased discount
against the terms of the Pounds 3.9bn bid proposed by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai
Banking and recommended by the Midland directors.
London was unsettled at the end of the session as Wall Street slipped to an
early fall of 16 Dow points after poor US unemployment data failed to bring
any immediate response from the Federal Reserve.
The stock market opened steadily as the EC countries appeared to reinforce
their commitment to the Maastricht treaty and the currency markets held
firm. But, after trying to edge into firmer territory, the stock market
began to react to renewed losses in gilt-edged stocks and to a discount on
the June futures contract on the FT-SE Index. By early afternoon, the
Footsie Index was 17 points down. Gilt-edged issues extended losses in late
trading to close nearly half a point off.
There was little heart in a late rally which left the FT-SE Index at
2,668.5, a net loss of 13.4 on the day as the first leg of the equity
trading account came to its close. The Footsie has fallen by around 1.4 per
cent over the week as the Danish referendum rejection of Maastricht has
raised uncomfortable doubts on convergence on European interest rates.
The loss of the FT-SE 2,675 mark was received badly by some chart analysts
who pointed to 2,650 and even 2,600 as the next defence lines.
At Strauss Turnbull, UK securities arm of Societe Generale, Mr Ian Harnett
warned of disappointment in the US at the absence so far of a further move
by the Federal Reserve and suggested that Wall Street was vulnerable if
investors lost faith in the likelihood of further help from the authorities
for the US economy.
He reiterated his 'cautious to down' view on UK equities, an opinion shared
at Nomura Research Institute, where Mr Nicholas Knight said the stock market
was 'beginning to falter.' SG Warburg Securities drew attention to
indications this week that Blue Circle's Pounds 242m rights call might imply
a resumption of equity funding demands.
Retail, or customer, business in equities has fallen as worries over
prospects for the Maastricht treaty have kept investors on the sidelines.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTINUED weakness in the Gilts market weakened stock index futures, pulling
the cash market lower and sending the contract to a discount to the index on
several occasions in the course of a volatile session, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at 2,686, a 7-point premium
to the cash market, but the optimistic mood did not last.
The weakness in gilts spilled over into FT-SE futures sending the contract
tumbling to 2,666 by lunch time. Following a period of sideways trading,
June attempted a rally which saw the contract creep back up to 2,676. But,
with no support from a weak Wall Street, June once again fell back, this
time to 2,644, the low of the day.
June closed at 2,673, down 14 on the previous close and around 1 point below
its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover was poor at
6,520.
Turnover in traded options remained poor at 26,313, with Midland bank
dominating the day's trading. It traded 5,576 contracts as dealers took
profits in the wake of the news that Lloyds Bank had withdrawn its proposed
bid for its rival.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar slips on payroll data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR slipped against the D-Mark on the foreign exchanges yesterday
after the unemployment rate in the US rose to its highest level since 1984,
writes James Blitz.
Analysts said that there was renewed pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease
interest rates and boost recovery after the May non-farm payroll report
showed that unemployment surged to 7.5 per cent in May from 7.2 per cent in
April. The overall picture was brightened by an upward revision in the April
payrolls to 182,000 from 126,000. But that did not stop the market sinking
into dollar blues. The US currency ended the day in London over a pfennig
down against the D-Mark at DM1.5880, and was hovering around the same levels
in late New York trading. It also ended down against the Japanese yen at
Y126.75 from Y127.55.
Some analysts believe that the dollar has a potentially stronger downside
now. 'The tone of the data for May has been set by the non-farm payroll
figures,' said Mr Mark Austin, chief economist at HongKong and Shanghai
Banking Corp in London. 'We may get to test the low end of the dollar's
ranges seen over the last couple of months, when the dollar hovered around
DM1.5750.'
Another reason for dollar bearishness is that the D-Mark's recovery seems
firmly based. Although it slipped slightly in Thursday's trading, the German
currency has lost few of the gains it made on Wednesday in the wake of
Denmark's 'No' to European Monetary Union (Emu).
Two currencies in Europe appear to be under pressure from the D-Mark rise.
The first is sterling, which yesterday slipped badly and spent much of the
day at the bottom of the European Monetary System grid for the first time
since April. It closed a  1/4 pfennig down against the D-Mark at DM2.9150.
The pound's decline has been partly accelerated by the decision of the
Danish and Italian authorities to raise interest rates. But the puff that
sterling received since the election has died away. There is still no firm
sign of UK economic recovery; the pound's support from the prospect of
European convergence was undermined by Denmark's 'no' vote to Emu; and, as
one economist put it, the Maastricht crisis has raised a few early doubts
about whether the UK government remains the most stable and confident in
Europe.
The other uncertain currency in the EMS is the Italian lira. Yesterday, the
Bank of Italy was forced to raise interest rates for the second time in a
week, moving its emergency funds rate up by  1/2 a percentage point to 13
per cent. But the currency still closed down against the D-Mark at Lira
756.80 from Lira 756.60.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Cash rates firmer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CASH rates in the sterling money markets were firmer yesterday as the market
grew concerned about sterling's poor performance on the foreign exchanges.
A large shortage of Pounds 1.1bn forecast by the Bank of England in its
money market operations also ensured that it was an expensive day in the
cash markets.
Sterling's  1/4 pfennig descent on the foreign exchanges down to DM2.9150
checked the view that another base rate cut will soon be signalled by the UK
authorities. Dealers feel that the difficulties over the progress of
European Monetary Union (Emu) leave sterling's position uncertain. And while
the Danish and Italian currencies have also been hit hard by these
uncertainties this week, their central banks have been forced to respond by
raising short term lending rates.
Period rates in the cash market were therefore firmer across the board.
1-month money ended the day at 9 15/16 per cent, up  1/8 on Thursday's
close. 3-month libor, often seen as a key indicator of how rates will move,
also ended  1/16 per cent up on the day at 10 per cent. However, one year
money was unchanged at 9 15/16 per cent.
The less optimistic view on rates was partly the result of the large
shortage forecast by the Bank of England at the start of the day, which
contrasted markedly with the small ones earlier in the week.
In the morning, the Bank of England purchased Pounds 76m of Band-1 bank
bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 132m of Band-2 bank bills also at 9 7/8
per cent.
The shortage was later revised to Pounds 1.2bn. The Bank later purchased
Pounds 42m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 18m of Band-2
bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent. In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 3m
of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 286m of Band-1 bank
bills also at 9 7/8 per cent. The overnight rate closed for the weekend at
11 per cent.
Trade in sterling futures also reflected the sterling gloom. The September
short sterling contract dropped 8 ticks on the day, closing at 90.19. This
reflects the view that 3-month libor will be at 9.81 per cent in four months
time.
The December contract ended at 90.45, down 5 ticks. This reflects the market
view that 3-month libor will be at 9.55 per cent at the end of this year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEICA'S camera subsidiary, arguably the most famous of the few remaining
camera makers outside Japan, is to be sold to its management and Deutsche
Beteiligungsgesellschaft, a subsidiary of Deutsche Bank.
The 78-year-old brand name will remain the property of Wild Leitz, a private
Swiss holding company, but the new owners, led by managing director Mr Bruno
Frey, will be allowed to continue to use it on cameras, lenses, enlargers
and projectors.
Sales last year were DM207m (Dollars 129.3m), or around 14 per cent of the
parent group's total turnover of DM1.6bn. Group profits after tax were
DM2.1m. Camera profits, the value of the deal and the size of the minority
stake to be retained by the former owner were not disclosed in yesterday's
announcement.
The disposal is understood to be part of a wide-ranging rationalisation plan
within the group.
The remaining business, controlled by Mr Stephan Schidheiny, who is reputed
to be one of world's richest individuals, will continue to focus on its core
interests in microscopes, sensors, measurement and environmental technology.
The camera business employs 1,500 in factories in Germany and Portugal and
in distribution subsidiaries in the UK, the US, Canada, France and
Switzerland.
Leica Camera is based in Wetzlar, where it was founded in 1914, and from
where it gained world renown as the successful developer of the 35mm camera
for amateurs.
The company formally became a subsidiary of Britain-based Leica Plc after
Wild Leitz - itself a part of Mr Schidheiny's Unotec holding group - merged
with Cambridge Instruments in 1989.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN Mining Corporation (WMC), the Australian resources group, yesterday
said a proposed ADollars 105m (USDollars 80.1m) expansion at its Kambalda
nickel operations would be postponed, in spite of legislation relaxing
restrictions on working hours.
The project has been abandoned or postponed several times over the last year
as WMC pursued negotiations with the miners' union to achieve a switch from
five-day to seven-day continuous mining.
The group reached agreement with the union last month after a series of
strikes and other disruptions to production. However, the agreement was
conditional on the passage of amendments to mining legislation through the
Western Australian state parliament.
The amendments were approved on Thursday, but only after the government had
added a further clause giving the state's mining minister the right to
change permissible working hours at his discretion.
Mr Hugh Morgan, WMC managing director, said the additional amendment was
'anything but acceptable'. He said it 'would seem to demonstrate that the
state government is a captive of the union movement, and prefers to remain
so, rather than create a positive investment climate'.
Mr Morgan said WMC 'cannot with confidence make further investments at
Kambalda other than that consistent with what is now contemplated as a small
operation'.
WMC's expansion plan for Kambalda would increase deep mining at several
mines in the area, where WMC produces around 35,000 tonnes of nickel a year.
The project is part of an ADollars 400m spending programme intended to
increase the group's total nickel output to 65,000 tonnes a year from 53,000
tonnes.
WMC shares fell 5 cents to ADollars 5.30 on the Australian Stock Exchange
after the announcement.

FT  06 JUN 92 / International Company News: BP of America to sell assets
</HEADLINE>

   LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BP OF America plans to sell more than 300 petrol stations and two
distribution terminals in California and Florida as the company continues to
dispose of North American assets.
The US subsidiary of the UK energy group - which is based in Cleveland, Ohio
 -cited poor industry conditions and a lower-than-expected market share in
Florida and California as reasons for its withdrawal from these states.
Analysts in London said the move represented an important turnround in
British Petroleum's US strategy of building up its west coast network of
filling stations.
At the group level, where total debt amounts to Pounds 8.56bn (Dollars
15.5bn), BP has embarked on a wide-ranging series of cost reduction
measures.
The company did not disclose the expected value of proceeds from it US
disposals, which come less than a month after BP raised Dollars 314m by
selling off its 56.94 per cent shareholding in BP Canada.
Bid packages for the Florida and California assets were distributed to
potential buyers last month.
BP's US operations still include five refineries, 7,500 petrol stations and
a number of truck stop outlets. BP America had 1991 revenues of Pounds 9.3bn
and a total workforce of 35,600 as of the end of 1991.
The assets being sold include 152 owned and leased petrol stations in
Florida plus one distribution terminal there. In California some 158 petrol
stations and another distribution terminal are to be sold.
Among those who will be affected by the BP withdrawal are independent
dealers and jobbers who operate under the BP brand name in the areas.
BP stressed that the move did not mean it would 'absolutely withdraw from
these markets'. It said the assets had been identified as non-core to BP's
marketing business.
In a separate development, BP Oil, the Cleveland-based company that is
selling the Florida and California assets, yesterday said Mr John McDonald,
president, would resign on September 1 to concentrate on charity work and
'to pursue an interest in higher education'.
Mr McDonald will be succeeded by Mr Steven Percy, a 16-year veteran of the
parent who is presently group treasurer of British Petroleum and chief
executive of BP Finance International in London.

DU PONT, the leading US chemicals group, is expected to record an
extraordinary second quarter after-tax charge of Dollars 100m to Dollars
135m as a result of settlements of claims by horticultural growers that the
company's Benlate DF anti-fungus product has damaged crops.
The charge, based on the company's announcement yesterday that it expected a
second-quarter charge against earnings of 15 to 20 cents a share, would
bring total fungicide payments by Du Pont to between Dollars 315m and
Dollars 350m on an after-tax basis.
Last year, Du Pont took a charge of 32 cents a share after-tax, or Dollars
215m, because of fungicide claims.
Analysts expect the special charge could reduce expected second-quarter
earnings of Du Pont from Dollars 571m, or 85 cents a share, to around
Dollars 436m, or 65 cents. The company's first-quarter earnings declined by
18 per cent to Dollars 482m.
The fungicide powder was withdrawn from the US market in March 1991 after
flower growers and other agricultural customers complained of plant damage
resulting from the product, known as Benlate dry flowable.
Mr William Kirk, general manager of Du Pont's agricultural products
division, said some claims rejected by the company were still being pursued
by growers in legal actions. However, he predicted that 90 per cent of the
claims would be settled or rejected by the company by the end of June.
The fungicide is estimated to have accounted for about Dollars 125m of
annual revenues before it was taken off the market. Analysts estimate that
total 1991 revenues of Du Pont's agricultural products division were about
Dollars 1.8bn.
In Florida, state agricultural officials are believed to be investigating a
series of complaints from growers that they have suffered harmful health
effects from the Benlate product. The product has been widely used on
ornamental plants, vegetables and other crops to prevent fungus growth.

FT  06 JUN 92 / International Company News: Tapie holding company falls into
red

<TEXT>
THE FINANCIAL fortunes of Mr Bernard Tapie, the controversial entrepreneur
who last week resigned from the French cabinet because of a fraud case,
yesterday took a turn for the worse when Bernard Tapie Finances (BTF), his
holding company, announced that it had fallen into a net loss of FFr294.9m
(Dollars 54.6m) last year.
The BTF announcement intensified speculation about the future of its 51 per
cent stake in Adidas, the German sporting goods group, which it acquired two
years ago. Mr Tapie recently announced he might consider selling Adidas.
Pentland, the UK consumer products company which last year bought 20 per
cent of Adidas, is thought to be a likely purchaser.
Mr Frank Farrant, director of Pentland, said yesterday that 'if Mr Tapie is
interested in selling we would certainly be buyers - providing the price was
right'.
BTF is still trying to pay off the remainder of the FFr2bn debt incurred in
the Adidas deal, which was viewed from the outset as a risky acquisition
because the German group was far larger than Mr Tapie's existing interests,
most of which he had acquired as bankrupt businesses in the early 1980s.
BTF's shares were suspended in Paris for an hour shortly after the
announcement. They rose by FFr3.5 during the day's trading to close at
FFr138.5.
One reason for BTF's swing into the red - from net profits of FFr47.97m in
1990 - was a FFr184m payment towards Adidas. By the end of 1991 its net debt
stood at FFr3.64bn, 21 per cent lower than a year before, and shareholders
funds at FFr1.72bn, a 26 per cent reduction. BTF said it would this month
make the final FFr730m repayment on Adidas.
BTF hopes to sell Testut-Terraillon, its weighing machine business, which is
already provisioned in the 1991 accounts, to help raise the FFr730m. It has
already raised FFr365m by selling several businesses, including the La Vie
Claire health food chain and a stake in the TF1 television station.
Meanwhile, Adidas is continuing its rationalisation programme by closing one
of its two Swiss subsidiaries with the loss of 27 jobs. It faces bitter
union opposition to its plans to shed 500 jobs in France.
Pentland, which negotiated pre-emptive rights over the rest of the Tapie
holding in Adidas as part of last year's deal, has made no secret of its
interest in Adidas. Mr Farrant said it had 'off and on contact' with Mr
Tapie.

FT  06 JUN 92 / International Company News: Pirelli backed on Continental
voting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER

<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S leading small shareholder association yesterday backed Pirelli,
the Italian tyre company, in its forthcoming attempt to overcome shareholder
voting restrictions at Continental, the German tyre group.
The Deutsche Schutzvereinigung fur Wertpapierbesitz (DSW) - a
Dusseldorf-based organisation which represents the interests of small
shareholders and has about 10,000 members - said that the preservation of
voting right restrictions is not in the interest of the mass of shareholders
in Continental.
This declaration, made in an open letter to the management board of
Continental, is a propaganda blow for Continental and Morgan Grenfell, its
merchant bank, ahead of a shareholders' meeting on July 3. Pirelli will for
the second year running challenge a rule which limits voting rights in
Continental to a maximum of 5 per cent per individual shareholder, no matter
how big that shareholder's holding.
The challenge represents a new phase of hostilities between the two groups,
which were in merger talks for almost 18 months before negotiations broke
down last December. Analysts suggest that Pirelli wants to get rid of the
rule so that it can sell its shares in the German company at as high a price
as possible.
Continental and Morgan Grenfell argue that the main reason for keeping the
voting restriction in place is that it serves to protect small shareholders.
The letter from the DSW says that shareholders' best interests are served if
they are allowed to have voting rights commensurate with the level of their
economic interest in a company, and that it will be encouraging its members
to vote with Pirelli.
Pirelli - which owns 5 per cent of Continental directly and has options over
another 34 per cent - is pressing ahead with a second attempt to overturn
the restriction despite a court ruling in Hanover last week which annulled
the outcome of shareholders' vote on the issue last March.
Last March, 65.97 per cent of shareholders voted in favour of the removal of
the restriction. A simple majority of over 50 per cent was required to get
the motion approved, but the restriction remained while the vote was
challenged in court.
Morgan Grenfell said yesterday that it was confident that a majority of
independent shareholders - those not associated with Pirelli - would vote
against Pirelli's motion on July 3. It argues that in a country without
rigorous takeover rules, the voting restriction provides a mechanism for
stopping predators taking control of a company without having to make a full
offer to all shareholders. It is not a mechanism for protecting incumbent
management from being dislodged by shareholders, the bank argues.
It is not known how many shares DSW or its members own in Continental. The
DSW declaration may encourage small shareholders actively to vote in favour
of the Pirelli motion, rather than leaving the decision to the big German
financial institutions which have custody over private individuals' shares.
Continental and Morgan Grenfell have been visiting these institutions in
recent weeks in order to influence the decision they take on behalf of their
clients.

static in first six months

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
METALLGESELLSCHAFT, the Frankfurt-based metals, mining and engineering
group, yesterday reported profits fractionally down for the first six months
of the current year.
Pre-tax profits were DM161.5m (Dollars 100.9m) in the six months to the end
of March - just DM700,000 lower than the DM162.2m made in the first half of
last year. Turnover for the six-month period rose by 17 per cent to
DM11.83bn, mainly because of acquisitions.
The company said that the flat performance - signalled earlier this year by
chief executive Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch - reflected poor prices for
non-ferrous metals and difficult conditions in its other markets, especially
for its Kolbenschmidt car parts subsidiary.
Looking ahead, the company said that it assumed results for the full year
would meet its expectations, in spite of difficult market conditions,
continued uncertainty over metal prices and a lack of evidence of a decisive
upturn in the economic outlook in Germany.
The company said profits from engineering would drop over the course of the
year, in spite of a rising order book, but it had high hopes for the
contribution from the businesses bought last year from Stora of Sweden -
Buderus (building materials and stainless steel goods), Dynamit Nobel
(explosives and plastics) and Cerasiv (ceramics and engineering plastics).

FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Heron's property values reduced by Pounds
300m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS to Heron International, Mr Gerald Ronson's property and finance
company which is seeking to reschedule Pounds 1bn of debt, heard yesterday
that Pounds 300m had been knocked off the value of the group's property
portfolio by the latest survey.
The 82 banks received a report from KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountants,
which included a Pounds 1bn valuation of Heron's worldwide property
portfolio. This compared with a Pounds 1.3bn valuation as part of an earlier
report by Price Waterhouse, which is advising Heron.
The lower figure was produced by Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, which looked
at the portfolio about a month later than the valuers working on Heron's
March 31 snapshot. The firms which produced the earlier survey included St
Quintin and Richard Ellis.
It was the collapse in Heron's estimated net assets to Pounds 115m by the
end of March which put it in breach of banking covenants and precipitated
the attempt to reschedule Pounds 1bn of the group's Pounds 1.45bn debt.
About Pounds 450m of Eurobonds are included in the restructuring. Following
defaults, winning the support of the bondholders is one of the main hurdles
for the proposals. They will receive information from the KPMG report, which
recommends a controlled disposal of the investment property portfolio.
Heron had already warned bondholders not to take any hasty action because
'in the event of a liquidation, it is estimated that the group's liabilities
would exceed assets'.
Leaving aside the fire-sale conditions which it is trying to avoid, Heron
said yesterday that it stood by the Pounds 1.3bn valuation and it did not
believe it had negative net worth.
'We remain committed to securing a successful outcome of the rescheduling of
our debt, leading to payment in full for all our creditors over time.' It
expected to complete the restructuring negotiations by the autumn.
The banks, which have granted Heron a standstill agreement until the end of
June, were said to be not particularly surprised at the lower valuation. It
would be taken into account in discussions with the company, as would KPMG's
recommendation of a controlled disposal, which echoed that of Price
Waterhouse.
The gap between the two valuations was said to reflect the difficulty of
valuing property in the current market. The difference in timing, bearing in
mind the continuing deterioration of sentiment as the Olympia &amp; York crisis
deepened, was one of the factors.
The five banks on the steering committee dealing with Heron Barclays,
National Westminster, Bank of America, Royal Bank of Canada and Chemical
Bank.

FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Storm runs into Pounds 98,000 losses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STORM GROUP, the West Midlands-based video and book publishing concern, ran
up pre-tax losses of Pounds 98,000 in 1991. This compared with an expected
out-turn of about break-even and with Pounds 369,000 profits for the
previous 13 months.
Mr James Driscoll, chairman, blamed the setback on the adverse effect on
short-term profits due to senior management time being spent on major
acquisitions during the final quarter.
In addition, Pounds 60,000 profit from 1991 had been deferred until this
year due to a requested delay in delivery of books and videos.
Mr Driscoll said that although 1991 was a disappointing year in terms of
results, Storm's market position was now stronger and it was making
significant strides towards meeting its objectives of becoming a leading
animation and licensing organisation in Europe.
He reported that during the first four months of 1992 the group had traded
profitably at the pre-tax level.
Turnover for the year increased to Pounds 1.43m (Pounds 985,000 for 13
months) mainly because of a full contribution from A4 Publications, the
licensing publications offshoot, compared with only two months in 1990.
Net interest received fell to Pounds 85,000 (Pounds 253,000) reflecting the
production costs of three cartoon animation series and lower interest rates.
An extraordinary charge this time of Pounds 290,000 related to a provision
against Storm's investment in its 50 per cent owned associate, Storm
Education.
Losses per share were 0.002p (0.68p earnings). The company's shares trade on
the USM.

FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dowty on target with Pounds 32.7m - Strong
performance in the final quarter expected to continue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWTY GROUP, the aerospace company fighting for its independent future
against a Pounds 522.2m bid from TI Group, yesterday published annual
results showing pre-tax profits of Pounds 32.7m in the year to end March.
The figure was in line with the group's earlier forecasts.
Mr Roy Roberts, Dowty chairman, said that there had been a strong
performance in the final quarter of the financial year which he expected to
continue. Following the cuts made to the group's cost base, including 3,000
job losses, he felt Dowty was well placed to benefit from improved trading
conditions.
Late in the day Dowty put out a statement, at the request of the Takeover
Panel, saying it had made no profit forecast for the current year. There had
been talk that Dowty's profits would bounce to between Pounds 50m and Pounds
55m, but Dowty said this speculation had no proper foundation.
Although profits were down from Pounds 60.6m in the previous year, the
figure was well above analysts' estimates of around Pounds 22m prior to
Dowty's forecast in its defence document of Pounds 29m and its prediction of
a Pounds 3m-Pounds 4m payment relating to the cancellation of a contract.
The Pounds 32.7m pre-tax figure included a Pounds 3.7m payment for the
cancellation. Mr Reg Moore, finance director, said that such payments were a
normal part of the business and he did not regard the amount as significant
in group terms.
TI, whose bid closes on June 10 at 1pm, rapidly responded raising questions
which it said the Dowty statement had not answered. Mr Chris Lewinton,
chairman and chief executive, said 'these figures only serve to highlight
the generosity of our offers'.
At last night's closing share price for TI of 361p, down 3p, the
eight-for-15 share offer is worth 192.5p per Dowty ordinary share. Dowty's
shares closed at 180p, down 2p, still above the 174.67p cash alternative.
Dowty's turnover was 9.7 per cent lower at Pounds 694.5m and operating
profits pre-exceptionals were 37.2 per cent down to Pounds 49.5m.
Exceptional items, relating to redundancy and reorganisation costs were
Pounds 1.8m (Pounds 4.8m). The interest charge rose to Pounds 14.9m (Pounds
12.8m) as borrowings were up Pounds 21m to Pounds 134m.
Earnings per share were 8.2p (15p) failing to cover a planned unchanged
total dividend of 9.2p, with a proposed 5.6p final. At the 192.5p offer
price, the p/e is 23.5.
The aerospace division saw trading profits drop to Pounds 27.8m (Pounds
41.3m) as the military side reduced and there was destocking of spares for
civil aircraft. Electronic systems contributed profits of Pounds 14.3m
(Pounds 13m) but this included the Pounds 3.7m cancellation payment.
Dowty's information technology division, which has been the target of
criticism by TI, lost Pounds 4.1m (profit Pounds 9.5m). Within that there
was a Pounds 4.4m loss at Cognito, the public data messaging service which
only went into operation last autumn. Polymer engineering made an unchanged
Pounds 9.6m.
TI said that Dowty had reported profits after charging Pounds 25.7m of
reorganisation costs directly to the balance sheet. But Mr Moore said these
costs were set against provisions made through the profit and loss account
in the previous year.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KENWOOD Appliances, the small kitchen equipment company purchased by
management from Thorn EMI in 1989 for Pounds 57m, yesterday published its
pathfinder prospectus for the flotation due on June 17.
The company, which reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.3m (Pounds 760,000
loss) for the year to March 31, is expected to be valued at about Pounds
100m, on a share price pitched between Pounds 2 and Pounds 3. The price
earnings ratio is likely to be about 16 times, compared with a consumer
index of over 17.
Some 40m to 45m shares are expected to be issued, representing approximately
half the total share capital, and will be divided equally between an
institutional placing and an open offer.
Mr Tim Parker, chief executive, said the group would use the proceeds of the
flotation to pay off its Pounds 40m bank borrowings. The 11 senior
management will hold about 8 per cent of the equity, including Mr Parker's 2
per cent.
Mr Parker said trading in the current year was going 'very well and our
prospects are excellent'.
The closing date for applications to the public offer is June 24. Dealings
are expected to begin on July 1.

court

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REUTERS HOLDINGS, the international news agency, said yesterday it had
settled out of court a claim from the Australian Tax Office at ADollars 59m
(Pounds 24.7m), well below the ADollars 164.5m the ATO had demanded. The
payment will be treated as an extraordinary item.
The claim arose when Reuters took over Australian Associated Press, a
company which had earlier sold some Reuters shares when the company was
floated in 1984 and swapped some for new Reuters shares. It sold some of
these in 1986.
Reuters bought a 48.8 per cent stake in AAP, whose only significant asset
was its Reuters shares, in 1988 and acquired the rest of the company in
1989. In 1990 the ATO decided that the gain made on the share sale should be
liable to income tax and put in its claim.
Reuters had disclosed the claim as a contingent liability in its last three
sets of accounts.
The dispute was due to come to court next week but the ATO then offered to
settle. Reuters said its lawyers advised that the settlement was reasonable.
Reuters shares fell 21p to Pounds 11.79.

FT  06 JUN 92 / UK Company News: British Gas closes computer software arm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EMBARRASSED British Gas has turned out the pilot light at a computer
software subsidiary it founded two years ago which only managed to win two
outside customers despite hiring up to 70 staff and making a substantial
investment.
Information Architechs, originally established as Quadrant Software
Services, was created to market what it believed would be a highly
profitable computer-aided software engineering (Case) package developed by
its employees in the north of England.
British Gas did not release a public statement about the closure and played
down its significance with a short official comment when quizzed yesterday.
It said the company was to cease trading after being hit badly by the
recession.
In the accounts ending March 31 last year, it showed losses of Pounds 1.69m.
British Gas said this year's losses would be up to Pounds 5m including
winding-up costs.
Information Architechs grew ambitiously by opening offices in London and
Windsor, and established a research and development centre in Leeds. It
announced last year that it expected to win 20 per cent of the Case market
by 1995.
But its only clients have been Mercantile &amp; General, the re-insurance
company, Clackmannan District Council in Scotland and the north-east region
of British Gas itself. Since its creation, British Gas had also been buying
products from one of its competitors.
Its operating costs rose rapidly and new management was brought in earlier
this year. But sales staff were being recruited recently on a basic salary
of Pounds 40,000 a year.
Mr Steuart Lauchlan, a journalist with Computing magazine who observed
Information Architechs, said: 'It behaved like a company that had been
around five or six years, spending money on extravagant gestures but not on
winning customers. The bottom line is it was a bit arrogant.'

Property Partnerships, the property and hotels group, announced a fall from
Pounds 2.06m to Pounds 1.76m in pre-tax profits for the year to March 31.
Mr Paul King, chairman, said in the past year the company had experienced
the worst conditions in the property industry for 60 years, while hotels in
the UK had had their most difficult time since 1982. Net rental income rose
to Pounds 1.91m (Pounds 1.68m) while hotel turnover fell to Pounds 4.33m
(Pounds 4.74m).
Earnings per share amounted to 13p (13.42p) and a final dividend of 4.5p
(4.35p) is proposed for a total of 7p (6.8p).
The value of the investment properties at March 31 was Pounds 1m down at
Pounds 22m - a deficit on book value of Pounds 1.5m. Net asset value per
share was 348p (355p).

<TEXT>
With almost all areas of its business affected by the recession, Somic, the
paper spinner and weaver, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 113,528 for the
year ended March 31 1992, against Pounds 50,113 profits before. Turnover
fell 11 per cent to Pounds 3.5m.
The directors said they were taking continuing action to reverse this
position and a gradual improvement was expected this year. Losses per share
for the year were 2.83p (1.69p earnings) but the final dividend is held at
1p.
New product developments had taken longer to materialise than envisaged.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Wintrust, the merchant banker, saw pre-tax profits for the year to March 31
fall from Pounds 4.01m to Pounds 3.02m. However, the company said that the
second six months showed profits 10 per cent higher than the comparable
period and the return on assets had increased from 2.7 per cent to 3.7 per
cent.
Mr Richard Szpiro, managing director, said the results must be regarded with
satisfaction as they covered a period in which the problems of financial
companies worsened.
Earnings per share were 19.54p (27.37p) basic or 19.16p (25.66p) fully
diluted. An unchanged final dividend of 6.3p is proposed for a maintained
9.3p.

<TEXT>
In its first set of results since converting to a public company last
August, Mid Southern Water announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 7.47m for the
12 months to March 31. In the previous 15 months profits amounted to Pounds
5.78m.
Turnover was Pounds 31.9m (Pounds 30.9m). A final dividend of 2.6p is
proposed for a total of 87.8p. Earnings per share were 200.2p.
Mr Patrick Packham, chairman, said the company's strong financial
performance had allowed price increases in April 1992 to be restricted to
10.8 per cent compared with 21.2 per cent in April 1991.
He added that Mid Southern's capital expenditure had totalled Pounds 8.93m
in the year and that it was constructing, at an estimated cost of Pounds
24m, treatment works on the River Thames at Bray.

CARR'S MILLING Industries, the Carlisle-based miller, baker and animal feed
maker, more than doubled pre-tax profits to Pounds 125,000 in the half year
to February 29. Last time profits were Pounds 52,000.
The result was after bakery rationalisation and redundancy costs of Pounds
102,000 and charges of Pounds 99,000 connected with a 1989 wheat contract
which had gone to arbitration.
Turnover improved to Pounds 38.9m (Pounds 37.6m) including Pounds 3.78m
(Pounds 3.66m) inter-company reprocessing sales.
Intense competition in the flour milling and baking businesses had continued
to affect margins, the company said. Volumes, however, had been maintained.
The egg laying and packing subsidiary had produced 'disappointing' results
while the engineering and restaurant businesses had traded well.
Earnings per share emerged at 1.5p (0.8p losses) and the directors are
holding the interim dividend at 1p.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Letter: Long-term view on apprentices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr TOM PURVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I have followed the correspondence about lack of UK apprenticeship
opportunities with some interest and was particularly struck by the comments
made by Mr Jarrett (May 28).
It is a sad effect of a tough economy that easy options may be taken by
companies seeking to make short-term cost savings. It is a shame that
talented young men and women should be forced to seek apprenticeships in
Germany rather than in the UK.
However, it is my experience that German companies, particularly those with
a very high technology base, have made, and continue to make, such
investments for the long-term benefit of their products and, in the case of
after-sales activities, to fulfil the best possible service for customers.
At BMW (GB), we instituted a comprehensive apprenticeship programme four
years ago, both at our headquarters and throughout our dealer network. We
now have more than 400 apprentices at various stages in their training
across the UK. This is one of the best investments BMW has made. Not only
does the scheme provide us with a highly-trained force of dedicated
technical people, but it also secures for BMW the right people to care for
ever more specialised products. This is particularly important as we enter a
period when demographic data indicate a clear shortage of young people.
Good people like Mr Jarrett will always look to improve their opportunities
by seeking out the best training available. Good companies will always seek
to improve their opportunities by providing the best training. The
successful ones will be those which take the long-term view and recognise
the value of the specialised staff on the ground. Good apprenticeship
programmes meet those needs.

FT  06 JUN 92 / A break in the march of history: The Danes' 'no' offers the
chance to create a more flexible EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Danes have shown they retain the moral courage displayed so famously by
their fathers and mothers during the Second World War. They may not have
stopped the onward roll of the Euro-wagon, but they have certainly put a
spoke in its wheel. And an excellent thing this is, too. For little valuable
has been lost. On the contrary, the Danish referendum offers an opportunity
to create a more flexible and more open Community.
Unnecessary in its goals, obscure in its language, incompetent in its
detail, the Maastricht Treaty has few redeeming features. It was quite
unlike either the customs union or the single market. This was the first
important step in the history of the European Community that could not be
justified as an expansion of the freedom and prosperity of the ordinary
European. The treaty is basically about power: mainly about who would set
Europe's monetary policy, to a lesser degree about who would set its foreign
and defence policies.
Neither is necessary. Europe already has a common monetary policy, set by
the Bundesbank, Europe's best central bank. Europe already has a common
defence policy, set by Nato. Maastricht would have dethroned the former and
accelerated termination of US involvement in the latter.
The notion that Europe - lacking labour market flexibility, labour mobility,
substantial fiscal transfers or a common fiscal policy - is fit for monetary
union seems fantastic. Yet those who believe in this cause need not despair.
They can still enjoy all the benefits of monetary union, most simply by
tying their currency still more closely to the D-Mark, perhaps by
instituting currency boards.
Many will complain that this is no way to 'build Europe', as if Europe does
not already exist. The Danes, they will assert, have obstructed the march of
history, with a capital aitch. But after communism's collapse, how can
anyone speak as if the future were known and pre-ordained?
The truth is otherwise. For its most convinced proponents, the long-term aim
of the Maastricht Treaty is the creation of a multinational, multilingual
superpower. Nothing in historical experience suggests such a structure is
feasible, let alone desirable.
Some still seem to argue that without further development of the EC, another
European war threatens. But why would forcing the Germans to abandon the
D-Mark render them more comfortable with their neighbours? Why should the
attempt to mount common military actions assuage deep differences among
Europeans in their desire for such interventions? How, in fact, can the
Maastricht Treaty make internecine struggles less likely than does the EC as
it already stands?
Above all, a treaty with so wide a sweep requires trust in those entrusted
with its execution. Such trust is impossible when one commissioner justifies
a proposal to limit the working week to 48 hours by appeal to a clause on
health and safety at work, another threatens the UK with withdrawal of a
derogation on VAT supposedly entrenched by unanimity, both of them confident
that the European Court will support them by reference to the ultimate aims
of the EC. Whatever powers one might suppose have been granted, far more
will finally be taken.
What, for example, might the Commission make of the Community's obligation
to 'contribute to the flowering of the cultures of the member states'? What,
more ominously, might the Commission make of the obligation to 'ensure the
conditions necessary for the competitiveness of the Community's industry'?
If the failure of the treaty could remove much that is both unnecessary and
undesirable, it also creates opportunities to improve the EC's constitution
and, above all, to enlarge the EC.
The principal problem is the role of the Commission. This posed no great
difficulty when the powers of the EC were restricted. The greater the EC's
powers, however, the more intolerable becomes the Commission's sole right to
propose Europe's most important legislation. These are mere appointees.
Worse, they are appointees convinced they possess inside information on the
purposes of history. These wings should be clipped.
Yet it is in relation to potential entrants that the failure of Maastricht
is most helpful. Deepening was bound to be an obstacle to widening. As it is
now, the EC could perhaps have been enlarged. But the powers that would
ultimately be transferred by the Maastricht treaty cannot possibly be
wielded by a council of ministers containing, say, 25 participants. The
powers that would be transferred as a consequence of the further revisions
necessitated, in time, by the Maastricht treaty could certainly not be
wielded by such a body. Something akin to a European government would be
needed. Since such a body cannot be created, enlargement would be halted.
Equally important, the greater the responsibilities exercised by the EC the
more difficult it would be for a heterogeneous group of countries to wield
them at all. With common monetary, economic, defence and foreign policies,
an EC containing Poland, the Czech lands, Slovakia, Hungary, Lithuania,
Estonia, Latvia, Slovenia, Croatia, Bulgaria and Romania - quite apart from
Sweden, Norway, Finland, Austria and Switzerland - would have been
unworkable.
In practice, it would never have advanced that far. The demands made by
poorer states for resources to finance their move to economic and monetary
union are already too great an obstacle to further enlargement eastwards.
The Danish rejection offers the possibility of a more open EC; it offers the
prospect of a more internally flexible EC; and it offers the prospect of a
more modest EC. Member states may now make such arrangements among
themselves as they wish. Should some states wish to unite with one another -
France and the Benelux with Germany, for example - they should be encouraged
to do so, thereby creating a new currency and one member state where there
used to be several. Meanwhile, other member countries might ask themselves
whether the exchange rate is not, after all, a price like any other.
The EC will always be more than a simple free trade area, but it should now
remain less than a political union. Best of all for Mr Major, the British
are not to blame for these blighted ambitions. It was not, it turns out, 11
against one. As the British government takes the presidency, it should
forget the historical, geographical and cultural absurdity of a Britain 'at
the heart of Europe' and seize the opportunity the Danes have presented it
with. Maastricht should now be renegotiated.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Letter: Competitive tendering - no 'level playing field' and
no quality considerations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From COUNCILLOR JEREMY BEECHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial of June 3 ('A long road to Whitehall reform') and the
report on which it is based impute to me a far more favourable view of
compulsory competitive tendering than I possess, or than could reasonably be
inferred from my recent speech to the Chartered Institute of Public Finance
and Accountancy's conference.
Compulsory competitive tendering (CCT) has led to financial savings, but in
too many cases at the expense of the wages and reasonable conditions of
employment of the workforce.
It has tied up valuable officer time and led to the creation of costly
systems while reducing the flexibility and responsiveness of some service
industry delivery.
There is no 'level playing field' for the local authority and private
contractors. The former can effectively only compete for their own work. The
government's real intention is to put local authorities out of the business
of direct provision of services.
Clear evidence of this was the announcement last year that local authorities
would not be permitted to tender for street works required by utilities,
notwithstanding a clear pledge by the government during the passage of the
relevant legislation.
I drew attention in my speech to one, quite accidental, benefit thrown up by
the CCT process - that is the fact that in preparing contract documents and
specifications it was necessary (albeit at considerable cost) to re-examine
the content of the work being put out to tender in minute detail.
This facilitated the process of enhancing the quality of service but could
be achieved without competitive tendering in much the same way as service
level agreements have operated for central services, themselves not yet
subject to a tendering process.
Paradoxically, local authorities are not entitled to take quality
considerations into account in deciding the outcome of the tendering
process, and many have found to their cost that successful private bidders
have provided a less than adequate service.
Local authorities, and their citizens, would have nothing to fear from a
competitive process which allowed genuine competition on equal terms, which
reflected minimum standards of wages and conditions and equal opportunities
considerations, and which allowed quality to be built in to the tendering
process.
That is not what the present CCT system encompasses, nor what the government
intends.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From R A REEVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Teresa McLean ('Umpires need to put their foot down,' May 30) misses
the stumps herself in consideration of lbw decisions. I recall a number of
years ago that some experiments were carried out at Lords with slow motion
cameras and other devices. If memory serves me correctly, less than half the
balls which would have met the stipulation about pitching in line or outside
the off stump etc., did in fact go on to hit the wickets.
The first and most crucial consideration to be made by an umpire is: 'Would
the ball have definitely hit the wicket?' If the answer is 'no', any further
deliberation is unnecessary. If yes, then consideration of where the ball
pitched and hit the batsman are taken into account.
At the Oval, both Inzamam and Miandad were given out when playing well
forward. When the ball has another six or seven feet to go before reaching
the stumps there is clearly much more doubt about the outcome and both these
batmen could consider themselves unlucky.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Out of step with the people: Politicians have failed to sell
the Maastricht Treaty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A shock wave surged across Europe this week, sending a disruptive wash in
several directions at once. The narrow anti-Maastricht vote in the Danish
referendum has splintered the convoy of EC members on their journey towards
ratification of the European union treaty.
It has focused attention on an apparent lack of democratic backing for the
goal of greater European integration proclaimed at the EC summit in the
Netherlands six months ago. And it has added to domestic difficulties of
several governments - notably in Germany and France - at the centre of the
Maastricht process.
The Danish mood finds an echo in other states where government policies on
Europe are falling foul of disenchanted electorates. The squalls unleashed
by the Danish 'No' are, however, clearly not just about European
integration. Voters are showing discontent over European policies partly, it
seems, as a means of expressing wider irritation with the political parties
which govern them.
'This was less a vote against Europe, more a vote against the politicians,'
said a Danish diplomat this week. The Danes - traditional Euro-sceptics -
threw out policies which had the backing of most of the Danish political and
corporate establishment. The diplomat singled out his own boss for blame. He
said that over-insistent pro-Europe campaigning by Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen,
the foreign minister, may have added to Danes' desire to teach the
politicians a lesson.
Officially, at least, the other EC states are brushing aside the Danish veto
almost as though nothing had happened. Foreign Ministers have agreed to
steam ahead with ratification, hoping to rope the Danes back on board later
on. None the less, the politicians can hardly afford to ignore the flare-up
of Euro-mutiny - unless they want to end up together on the rocks.
During the months before the Maastricht agreement in December last year,
there was in most EC countries astonishingly little public debate on the
exact nature of the institutional and economic changes planned by the EC.
Now, as the Danish referendum result helps bring anti-Maastricht feeling out
into the open elsewhere, the people's voice is starting to be heard. 'The
whole thing could become a catalyst,' says Mr Gordon Heald, managing
director of the UK arm of the Gallup opinion survey company, an experienced
hand in Euro-polling.
One member of a government clearly rocked by Tuesday's vote is Mr Ulf
Dinkelspiel, Sweden's minister for European affairs, who is in charge of
negotiating Sweden's application for EC membership. 'This was a warning
light for the politicians. What happened in Denmark showed that the
politicians are not fully in touch with the people,' he says. Showing how
Denmark's 'No' is reverberating well beyond its borders, Mr Dinkelspiel
points out how Swedish opinion polls at the end of this week showed a sharp
anti-EC swing. Although he believes such opposition will be overcome,
Stockholm's bid to join the Community, like those of Austria, Finland and
other countries may now be held up.
As far as their general views on Europe are concerned, the public across the
continent - in an inevitably diffuse way - seem to be expressing two broad
messages. People appear generally satisfied with the achievements of the
European Community so far. But they favour a slowdown in further changes
while they digest those which are taking place already. The Community's
regular 'Eurobarometer' of public opinion across the 12 members has shown a
steady increase in general support for the Community. An overall 69 per cent
of EC populations believe that Community is a 'good thing', according to the
latest poll at the end of last year against 60 per cent in 1985 and only 56
per cent in 1973, when Britain joined. The percentage of Britons in favour
has risen from 31 per cent in 1973 and 24 per cent in 1980 to 57 per cent
last year.
On the 'widening' and 'deepening' of the Community implicit in the
Maastricht process, the picture is different. Here, anxieties come to the
surface - for a mixture of motives. Worries about the cost of embracing the
poorer southern states, as well as, later, the former communist countries of
central and eastern Europe, play a part. So do fears about falling barriers
to industrial and agricultural competition, and about a lack of democracy in
Community institutions. Last year, 27 per cent of those surveyed said they
were either 'rather fearful or very fearful' about the 'single market',
which comes into effect on January 1 1993, against only 22 per cent in 1988.
Additionally, as the chart shows, support for 'unification of western
Europe' has dropped in recent years in the richer countries which believe
they will have to pay for it.
At a time when established parties across the EC have been suffering falling
electoral support, the Danish rejection adds to governments' difficulties in
winning popular support for Maastricht ratification. One of the few
countries where the Copenhagen 'No' has not caused tremors is Italy -
reflecting the media's understandable preoccupation with the imbroglio over
attempts to form a new government. In Britain, where the pre-Maastricht
discussion was more vociferous than elsewhere, Mr John Major, the prime
minister, faces a revolt from Tory backbenchers on his European policies. In
France, where the popular mood remains heavily in favour of the Maastricht
treaty, President Francois Mitterrand on Wednesday announced a referendum on
the issue, scheduled to be held in the autumn. Most ominously for
Maastricht-backers, public opinion in Germany seems to be swinging against
the treaty. This partly reflects German worries about abandoning the D-Mark
as part of European monetary union. Many Germans also fear that the proposed
political union will be too far removed from parliamentary control, and will
contravene Germany's principles of sharing power with the federal states.
The basic reasons for German Euro-scepticism may not be all that different
from those which have always existed elsewhere. The doubts are however
coming to the surface in the country which has always, along with France,
provided the motor for integration. So these new German misgivings,
potentially at least, have considerable greater explosive power than the
small blast in Copenhagen which captured all the attention this week.
'The Germans are worried about the pace (of integration),' says Prof
Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann, the head of the Allensbach Institute and the
doyenne of European opinion pollsters. 'Decisions are being forced through
too fast.' Ms Noelle-Neumann a confidante of Chancellor Helmut Kohl, points
out that the drive towards European union was intensified in 1989-90. This
was the result of a Franco-German initiative to show that, in spite of
German unification, Germany would remain a 'good European.' Now, with the
costs of unifying their own country much higher than expected, Allensbach
surveys show a growing number of Germans want to slow European union while
Germany copes with its own national challenge.
Only 18 per cent of the population, according to an Allensbach poll earlier
this year, believe a single European currency would be as stable as the
D-Mark. Some members of the Opposition Social Democratic Party (SPD) have
this week called for a German referendum on Maastricht. If such a referendum
were held tomorrow, Ms Noelle-Neumann says, she would be 'uncertain' whether
Mr Kohl would receive a 'Yes' vote.
Mr Gunther Nonnenmacher, foreign editor of the Frankfurter Allgemeine
Zeitung, the conservative German daily newspaper, laments the lack of a
suitable forum in which German doubts about European policies can be
properly aired. 'There has never been a proper debate, either within the
parties, or between them,' Mr Nonnenmacher says. He believes that the Danish
vote may prompt a 'bandwagon' effect in Germany. An initial indication that
this may be happening was a hastily conducted opinion survey carried out
this week in which an astonishing 81 per cent of respondents said they
opposed the treaty.
One reason for such a result is that public opinion in all EC countries is
becoming much more volatile, says Mr Nonnenmacher. 'This is mixed up with
general antipathy against politicians, against the political class, and
against bureaucrats.' There is clear evidence of this trend, too, in France.
Mr Francois Cornut-Gentille, assistant director of political polling at the
Sofres opinion research organisation in Paris, notes that the Maastricht
Treaty is backed by the leaders of nearly all the mainstream political
parties, as well as most of the French media. The treaty is normally given
sizeable majorities in opinion surveys.
None the less, pro-European sentiment is both 'reserved' and 'ambiguous' he
says. 'This is partly because much of the Maastricht legislation is very
difficult to understand.' Alongside worries on questions like sovereignty,
'there is a confusion about where we are going,' he says. Mr Cornut-Gentille
adds that, like in Germany, 'The debate has never been given a real
content.'
This fluidity of French opinion carries clear risks for President
Mitterrand, who has slid down the opinion polls in recent months. A poll in
the Parisien newspaper on Thursday showed a 2 to 1 majority in favour of
Maastricht. But 42 per cent of those asked said they would abstain in the
forthcoming French referendum, or were undecided. Mr Mitterrand has called
the referendum chiefly to expose a split over Maastricht in the Right-wing
opposition. It is likely that Mr Mitterrand's ploy will succeed. Yet he is
also taking a risk. If the referendum is interpreted not only as a decision
on Europe, but also as a vote of confidence in the presidency, then the
referendum 'might incite the opposite of what the President wants,' Mr
Cornut-Gentille says.
As Europe ponders the fall-out, the Danish vote has demonstrated one very
real success of European integration. Trends in public opinion cannot be
confined to one country, but leap instantly across borders. The Danish
referendum, and its aftermath, underscores voters' mistrust of politicians
as much as it does their mistrust of a federal Europe. But if the people
cannot trust the politicians, who else is there to lead them towards an
integrated, stable and prosperous continent?

FT  06 JUN 92 / School's out - and nowhere to go: Graduates of the 1990s are
facing gloomy prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS, WILLIAM DAWKINS, GEORGE GRAHAM, ROBERT THOMSON and
DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a tough time for new graduates across the developed world. The halcyon
days when bright young things brandishing degree certificates had the world
at their feet are over. Change in the pattern of graduate employment extends
beyond recession-induced pressures. Graduates are not simply flooding a
saturated market: after decades of steadily increasing supply, they have
fundamentally changed the nature of the market itself.
Let the numbers speak. In the mid-1960s Britain had 220,000 full-time
students. It now has nearly 700,000, and numbers have risen by 200,000 - 40
per cent - in the past five years alone. By the year 2000, its university
population is projected to be close on 1m, with one in three 18-year-olds
proceeding to higher education.
In the former west Germany the numbers graduating from universities with
degrees have risen from 47,800 in 1960, to 87,000 in 1970, 123,680 in 1980,
and nearly 170,000 last year.
Growth rates are similar in the rest of Europe, Japan and the US. So are the
hard-luck stories among recent graduates.
In Britain, unemployment among new graduates has virtually doubled in the
past two years, with more than one in 10 of last year's crop out of work six
months after graduating. According to the Incomes Data Services research
group, graduate vacancies are slightly up this year, but by barely half the
amount needed to make up for the increase in numbers graduating - let alone
for the 20 per cent drop in graduate vacancies last year. Unlike the 1980-82
recession, this one has hit hard in the prosperous, degree-rich south-east,
with few employers prepared to risk a return to the high recruitment levels
of the late 1980s.
'It is not just unemployment: under-employment is as marked among recent
graduates,' says Mr Richard Pearson, director of the Brighton-based
Institute of Manpower Studies. The number downgrading their aspirations -
from scientist to technician, administrator to clerical officer, and so on -
is growing; so is demand for second degree courses.
In Japan, too, companies are correcting for over-ambitious recruiting in the
late-1980s and a sharp fall in profits last year. The steel industry has
announced reductions of up to 50 per cent in graduate hiring; other sectors
are healthier, but almost all are down on last year. Faced with growing
inventories, 'sales' is the watchword, and with it a readiness to hire
less-qualified young people more prepared to do the cold-calling. Doda, an
employment information company, reports sales and marketing vacancies are
growing, while occupations considered important during the boom, such as
design and other creative work, are less in demand.
Prospects are no brighter for the 1.1m graduating this year in the US. 'It's
probably the worst market in two decades,' according to Mr Victor Lindquist,
director of career placement services at Northwestern University, Illinois.
His surveys of employers show 47 per cent expecting to recruit fewer
graduates than in 1991 - itself scarcely a bonanza year. The US economy,
struggling to emerge from two years of sluggish growth, is going through a
wave of 'downsizing', hitting white-collar workers much more than previous
recessions.
Starting salaries are suffering accordingly. After years of outstripping the
national earnings increase, this summer's projected average for new UK
graduates of Pounds 12,700 (Pounds 11,664 in the public sector) is just up
with inflation. In the US, universities in the Washington area report offers
little or no better than 1991. Chemical engineers are faring best, with
offers around Dollars 39,000 (Pounds 21,400); offers to economics and
finance graduates are down at an average Dollars 25,600.
For all that, doom merchants should be kept at bay. 'Few question the
lifelong advantage to individuals and the economy conferred by higher
education,' says Mr Pearson. Among the entire graduate population,
unemployment in most countries is well below the national rate. Salary
differentials remain wide, and widened in the 1980s. Longer-term
consequences are likely to be cultural and career shifts among graduates.
One simple fact stands out: the rapid increase in the numbers of women at
college. In 1990 women accounted for half of Britain's university applicants
 -up from 40 per cent in 1979.
More nebulous, but still pronounced, is a shift in fashion. Research among
German students by Messrs Gotz Schindler and Joachim Schuller, published by
the Bavarian state's higher education institute, identifies profound changes
in outlook between contemporary students and their forebears of 20 years
ago. Whereas the early 1970s cohort was markedly conservative, emphasising
values like stability, security, duty and protection of the existing social
order, today's students give priority to values like emancipation,
independence and self-fulfilment.
Generalisations about cross-country trends must be treated with scepticism.
Some trends, like the continuing UK aversion to manufacturing industry, are
country-specific. But a reaction against get-rich-quick graduate options is
evident across frontiers. So, with notable exceptions, is a longer-term
drift away from the public sector, indeed from the whole notion of 'public
service'.
Until the current recession, the Civil Service Commission was experiencing
difficulty recruiting sufficient high-calibre candidates to fill Whitehall's
fast stream. Even in France, where the brightest and best French graduates
invariably used to dream of life in the public administration, aspirations
have changed over the past decade, with a corporate career now almost as
highly valued as serving the state.
A typical member of the French old guard is Mr Jacques Attali, president of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, who went to both the
Polytechnique and the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (Ena), the two best
known of the Grandes Ecoles, the elite civil service colleges which train
the brightest youngsters for the public service. 'Ena is a magnificent
school because people there put the state, not money, at the forefront of
their preoccupations,' says Mr Attali. That, however, is becoming less true
as more Grandes Ecoles alumni leave straight after graduation, either to
business schools - which report a big rise in attendances - or straight into
industry. Young civil service-trained graduates can now be found in groups
as diverse as Bouygues, in construction, Rossignol in skis and Peat Marwick
in accountancy.
The state has never starred in the American dream, but US graduates are
reacting against the 1980s all the same. Says Mr Lindquist: 'The expectation
of working 70 or 80 hours a week in a fast-track environment, albeit with a
great deal of money, is not the kind of pursuit that is going to attract as
many as it did a few years ago.'
As for Britain, a poll by Mori last year showed that for the first time
since 1983 graduates were less greedy in their average salary expectations
than those in the previous year. Only a fifth of graduates volunteered high
starting salary as important in their career choice; long-term pay and
benefits were valued by twice as many as starting salary, with a third
highlighting opportunities for foreign travel.
The travel bug is catching. Fresh from a packed session on opportunities in
the UK diplomatic service, Mr David Chamberlain, of Oxford University's
careers service, talks of the 'anywhere but here syndrome'. 'The number
wanting to get abroad, mostly for a few years before starting a long-term
career, is shooting up.' Graduates are gaining most from the 'Europe without
frontiers'.
The enthusiasm of graduates for moving about in their 20s is increasing more
generally. Half of all entrants to secondary-level teacher training courses
in Britain are now 'mature', with the average age of entrants to the
profession at 26. Few have even graduated by that age in Germany, but even
there the attraction of 'time out' is rising. The Bavarian state survey
found almost 80 per cent of those studying scientific subjects to be between
20 and 25 when they start their studies, as opposed to 57 per cent 20 years
ago.
The big increase in graduate supply is itself shaping the market. Most
obviously, the professions are now graduate preserves. Careers like
personnel, which attracted few graduates 20 years ago, have now all but
closed their doors to those without degrees. Barely 2 per cent of Britain's
trainee accountants are now non-graduates. Between them, accountancy and the
legal profession, which 25 years ago took some 6 per cent of Oxford
University's annual output, now consume about a fifth.
That is the reverse image of the placement trend for the largest of the
traditional graduate professions - teaching, the attraction of which to
Oxbridge graduates plummeted in the 1980s. In many countries, of course,
teaching has retained high status, but the point brings out a larger one
more generally applicable: the growing differentiation between elite
colleges and the plethora of higher education institutions beneath them.
If anything, the relative prestige of elite institutions has increased, as
in most countries the brunt of expansion has been borne by polytechnics or
liberal arts-style colleges. Sir Ralf Dahrendorf, warden of St Antony's
College Oxford, fears for the future of Britain's universities as they go
down the continental road of mass higher education. But his alma mater is
proving resilient in self-defence. While in the three years to 1991,
Sheffield Polytechnic increased its full-time numbers by more than a third,
numbers at Oxford expanded by less than 5 per cent - and the university
plans no net growth in the next decade.
Across the Channel, the Grandes Ecoles still account for only 53,000
students out of 1.1m throughout France - far more exclusive, in relative
terms, than the Ivy League or Britain's elite institutions. In Japan,
similarly, the university attended by a graduate is generally more important
than his or her results, with Tokyo, Kyoto and Waseda at the top of most hit
lists.
Greater diversity and differentiation, then, are on the cards for the 1990s.
And what if graduate unemployment fails to abate? According to one
celebrated thesis, a prime cause of the 1848 revolutions in Germany was an
excess of highly educated unemployed. Another revolution of the
intellectuals? Stuff and nonsense to the British, of course. Says Mr Pearson
of the Institute of Management Studies: 'At the moment there's only one
fashion - to get a job.'

FT  06 JUN 92 / Offer for Hawes creamery refused
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
DAIRY CREST, the Milk Marketing Board subsiduary, yesterday rejected a
Pounds 160,000 offer from the Hawes Dairy Rescue Committee for its
cheese-making creamery in the North Yorkshire town, Chris Tighe writes.
Dairy Crest ceased production of Wensleydale and other cheeses at the
factory last week to transfer production to Lancashire. It told local
campaigners that their offer, increased from Pounds 120,000, was still
substantially below its own valuation.
Mr John Blackie, rescue committee spokesman, said it would submit a final
offer next week. He said premises had been lined up to start a new Hawes
Wensleydale cheese factory if the offer was rejected.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Fifth council properties in Southwark illegally occupied
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UP TO a fifth of council properties owned by the Labour-controlled London
borough of Southwark are illegally occupied, Mr Tony Baldry, junior
environment minister, told the Commons yesterday, Ivor Owen writes.
He said it was a 'matter for concern' that 11,000 of the 55,000 properties
were illegally occupied when there were 15,000 people on the housing waiting
list.
Mr Baldry clashed with Mr John Fraser, MP for Norwood and a former Labour
minister, who said that when rent was paid by a person whose name was not
that on the rent book it could not be described as 'squatting'.
The minister interpreted Mr Fraser's view as meaning 'if the caretaker is
flogging off keys, providing you are paying rent, it's OK'. Mr Fraser
accused the minister of misrepresenting him.
Mr Baldry confirmed that legislation would be introduced in the autumn,
providing a 'lower-risk route' to owner occupation for council tenants
through a rent-to-mortgages scheme.
Mr Clive Soley, a Labour housing spokesman, attacked the minister for using
Southwark and other Labour councils as 'scapegoats' for the government's
failure to provide affordable housing for the growing number of homeless.

FT  06 JUN 92 / SE issues proposed Taurus regulations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LONDON Stock Exchange has announced proposed rules for participation in
its Taurus service, the long-awaited paperless settlement system due to be
launched next year.
The rules outline three main categories: full participants who can move
stock within the system; market participants who send instructions to other
participants to move stock for them; and company controllers and registrars
who can move shares in their own company. Each group must satisfy specific
requirements on technical competence, systems security and financial
adequacy.
The planned rules have been amended after comments on the draft proposals
published in June last year. A further consultative period runs until July
31.
The system is scheduled for launch next April, although testing will be
delayed until January. That follows a hitch in the development of an IBM
system to protect the network from 'hackers'.

FT  06 JUN 92 / BR axes Grimsby InterCity service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEARS THAT the privatisation of British Rail might lead to service cuts were
reinforced by the announcement yesterday that south Humberside was to lose
its InterCity link with London.
The service was one of 15 listed as vulnerable in a memorandum drawn up by a
BR employee and leaked to Mr John Prescott, the shadow transport secretary,
earlier this year. Another of the 15, the InterCity link between Shrewsbury
and the capital, was axed last month.
The service to be cut is the daily InterCity train from Cleethorpes,
Grimsby, Lincoln and Newark to London. It leaves south Humberside each
morning, returning in the evening.
British Rail said the decision had been taken for commercial reasons. The
498-seat high-speed diesel train had typically carried fewer than 100
passengers between Grimsby and the east coast main line at Newark, and could
be put to more profitable use elsewhere.
Withdrawal of the service will take effect with the introduction of the
October timetable. After that, London-bound passengers will have to take a
local train to Newark, then change.
Mr Edward Leigh, Conservative MP for Gainsborough and Horncastle, attacked
the decision as 'deplorable'. He said BR had claimed there was no threat to
the service.
Mr Prescott said he had warned this year that Tory cost-cutting and
privatisation measures would bring cuts in services. 'Sadly, my prediction
is coming true.'
Other services listed as vulnerable in the memorandum are those on the
fringes of the InterCity network such as the lines beyond Plymouth in Devon,
west of Swansea, north of Glasgow and Edinburgh, and beyond Doncaster to
Hull. Mr Prescott's constituency is Hull East.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Clearer's clerical staff reject pay offer

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLERICAL staff have voted to reject the Royal Bank of Scotland's pay offer
of between 2.5 per cent and 3.5 per cent. Turnout for the ballot was 35 per
cent.
Managerial staff at the bank have accepted a modified performance-related
offer in a separate ballot. Bifu, the banking union, said it was satisfied
that the bank had addressed fears that the offer failed to guarantee an
annual rise for more than 4,000 managerial staff. The union will consider
the position of the 12,000 clerical staff at a meeting in Glasgow next
Thursday.
It originally asked for an 8 per cent increase on all salaries, with a
minimum of Pounds 600. It is understood that the bank is unlikely to improve
its offer.
Meanwhile, an existing dispute continues at the bank over whether staff are
entitled to withdraw from overtime they normally work. Staff have banned
overtime and are working to contract.

FT  06 JUN 92 / TGWU opposes Labour reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TGWU general union, Britain's biggest union and the largest affiliate to
the Labour party, yesterday signalled its intention to block any radical
reform of the link between the unions and the party.
Mr Bill Morris, TGWU general secretary, said his union would draft a motion
for this year's Labour conference that would reject most of the reforms
being canvassed, including the idea of giving party membership status to
union members who pay the political levy.
He suggested, however, that his union executive believed there could be
radical reform of the Trades Union Congress. Mr Morris said the TUC should
stop 'reinventing the wheel' by performing functions individual unions could
do for themselves, and should abandon the fiction of influencing the
government with its alternative economic analyses.
Mr Morris refused to say that Mr Norman Willis, TUC general secretary, was
the right man for the job. 'We work with the leader we have,' he said.
The TGWU statement on union-Labour links is the latest sign of opposition to
the radical shake-up in the relationship that was envisaged after the
general election.
All three candidates for the deputy leadership of Labour are now stressing
the importance of retaining the link, and the Nupe public-service union
warned last week that unions would not go funding Labour if they had no
direct influence in the party.
Several unions, including the TGWU and the GMB general union, oppose the
Labour national executive committee's proposal to exclude unions from
selection and reselection of party candidates.
Mr Morris also defended the TGWU against charges that its backing for Mr
John Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett as Labour leader and deputy leader
respectively was not justified, given the small number of union members who
were consulted.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Dentists expected to hold ballot on fees cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN PIKE, Social Affairs Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Dental Association leaders meet today to decide whether to ballot
their members on action over the government's plans to cut dentists' fees.
The association's board is almost certain to proceed with a ballot that
would offer Britain's 18,000 dentists a range of options, including complete
withdrawal from providing National Health Service treatment. Other possible
forms of action include a ban on accepting new adult NHS patients and
refusal to co-operate with NHS administration.
The immediate cause of the dispute is a decision by Mrs Virginia Bottomley,
health secretary, to reduce dentists' fees by 7 per cent. Fee scales need to
be cut, the government says, because dentists' earnings are exceeding the
recommendations of the doctors' and dentists' pay review body.
The dispute is exacerbated by a long period of strained relationships
between dentists and the government over a contract introduced in October
1990. Discontent with the contract has led some dentists to withdraw from
NHS work, and more are threatening to do so if fees are cut.
The review body recommended an 8.5 per cent increase in dentists' net
remuneration for 1992-93 and set average net earnings at Pounds 35,815.
Ministers accepted that but say the present scale of fees on which dentists'
payments are calculated would provide incomes 'substantially more' than
those proposed by the review body.
The government believes it would require a 23 per cent reduction in fees to
bring dentists' remuneration to the recommended level. It says the proposed
7 per cent cut would still give dentists an average of Pounds 40,000 this
year.
Dentists' negotiators have rejected the proposal. Further talks are
scheduled for June 17 but, with neither side expecting the other to move,
the BDA ballot is likely to start soon afterwards.
The dispute over the proposed fees reduction has brought to a head simmering
tension about the contract, which marked a shift from payment per procedure
to flat-fee arrangements. Dentists say their relative pay position declined
in the 1980s, and claim the contract is administratively complex and
undervalues preventative work.
Mr Michael Watson, the BDA's head of employment services, said yesterday:
'The reaction of most dentists to a 7 per cent fees reduction would be to
try to recover the loss by doing 7 per cent more work, and this would not be
good for the rational organisation of the service.'
Mrs Bottomley says the government is committed to a fundamental review aimed
at developing a more effective remuneration system, under which the health
department and dentists' representatives negotiate expenses scales intended
to achieve the review body's recommendations on net pay.
Many dentists would support such a move, but would not want the review to
take place in the middle of a dispute.

contract, Daniel Green writes.
Mr Jonathan Aitken, defence procurement minister, said the defence ministry

Aldermaston, Berkshire.
The contract will run for seven years from April next year and will
principally involve the Trident nuclear submarine programme.
The four companies invited to bid are British Aerospace, Rolls-Royce, GEC
and the Hunting-Brae naval shipbuilding consortium, which has been involved
in running AWE since October 1990 in a pilot for the privatisation.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Brazil steps in as summit broker

BRAZIL is trying to broker an agreement between the developed and developing
worlds which would unlock financial resources to deal with global
environmental problems.
At present, both sides are far apart, with Third World countries demanding
large increases in aid, and donor nations anxious not to commit themselves
to outlays over which they would have little control.
Brazil is proposing that money be advanced through overseas development
assistance (ODA); the International Development Agency (IDA) and the Global
Environment Facility (GEF) (both arms of the World Bank); the regional
development banks; and private investment.
Significantly, the Brazilian proposals do not include the 'Green Fund' which
has been demanded by the Group of 77 (G77) developing countries. This has
made Brazil's plan more acceptable to the donor nations who are resisting
the creation of a new aid agency. But Third World countries might find it
harder to accept for the same reason.
Mr Rubens Ricupero, the Brazilian chairman of the contact group discussing
financial resources, said the proposals did not contain hard numbers. But
officials said they estimated that the commitments would amount to Dollars
6bn-Dollars 9bn a year. Aid of Dollars 5bn (Pounds 2.7bn) has been mentioned
as realistic.
Agreement on a financial package is crucial to the success of the Earth
Summit. It will flesh out Agenda 21, the action plan which the Summit is
supposed to approve. This will need massive financial support to enable
Third World countries to play their part in dealing with global
environmental problems.
Initial reactions from G77 countries on the Brazilian proposal were angry
and last night's meeting of G77 ministers was expected to be stormy.
Mr Zulfikar Qureshi from Pakistan, which chairs the G77, said the GEF could
only be acceptable as a fund if it was expanded in scope, financial
resources and governance and added that such decisions should be taken at
Rio.

FT  06 JUN 92 / European arms cuts pact signed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATO and its former Warsaw Pact adversaries yesterday signed an agreement on
sweeping arms cuts in Europe, which had been blocked by the collapse of the
Soviet Union and disagreements among its successor states over how to share
out reductions in tanks, aircraft and other military equipment.
The protocol to the conventional forces in Europe treaty (CFE), signed in
Paris at the end of 1990 when the Soviet Union was still a unified state,
was signed by 29 members of the North Atlantic Co-operation Council, created
in December as a forum for co-operation between Nato and the former Warsaw
Pact members.
The problems between Russia and the other members of the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) were finally sorted out at a summit in Tashkent
last month. The aim is that the CFE treaty will now be ratified by all its
signatories in time for a summit of the 52-nation Conference on Security and
Co-operation in Europe, due to be held in Helsinki at the beginning of next
month.
However, one of the CIS states, Belarus, may not be able to ratify the
treaty in time because it is still drawing up a constitution and because of
domestic political opposition, according to officials here.
Most Nato and east European countries have already ratified the treaty, but
Turkey has yet to do so. Once the treaty has been ratified by all its
signatories, the arms cuts will have to be implemented over a four-year
period.
Under the CFE treaty, the former Soviet republics have undertaken to destroy
much more equipment than western countries, whose conventional forces in
Europe have always been numerically smaller. But the treaty does not cover
cuts in military manpower. That issue will be the subject of a new
agreement, negotiations for which have barely got under way. Nuclear weapons
and naval forces are also excluded from CFE.
Among the CIS states, by far the biggest cuts will be made by Russia,
followed by the Ukraine and Belarus.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Citizens ponder aftermath of their No-vote: The vote against
ratifying the Maastricht treaty contained a strong element of protest
against the political establishment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Danish politicians try to sort out the country's future relationship
with the rest of the European Community following Tuesday's rejection by
voters of the Maastricht treaty, ordinary Danes are astonished to find
themselves in the spotlight.
Denmark has probably not played such a prominent role in Europe since 1864,
when Bismark's armies trounced the Danes and took Schleswig-Holstein, or
possibly 1940, when Hitler's armies marched in.
'It suddenly felt important to be a Dane,' said a university student
yesterday, a Yes-voter who was appalled at the EC crisis which his fellow
voters have brought about.
The vote contained a strong element of protest against the political
establishment. Some of the No-voters are having regrets. A waitress said she
voted No out of general dislike of Denmark's powers-that-be, feeling
confident that Yes votes would prevail.
Enthusiastic opponents were convinced they were striking a blow for national
independence. 'Hurrah] We're free,' wrote the TV critic of a popular tabloid
immediately after Tuesday's vote.
But by yesterday jubilation had turned to indignation: 'The psychology of
power in Europe is clear: Denmark will be made to bow its head and stay
caged,' she wrote. Her conclusion seems to mesh well with the government's
campaign warnings, that a No-vote would lead to 'dependence Prime minister
Poul Schluter, who yesterday cancelled a trip to the final session of the
Earth Summit in Rio, and Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister and
Liberal party leader, are being advised by a 'crisis' group of leaders from
all eight parties in the Folketing, the Danish parliament.
Ironically, these include two which recommended a No vote, the Socialist
People's party and the populist right-wing Progress party. So far, no
prominent politician who voted No has been heard to express doubts now that
the consequences are becoming apparent.
But Mr Arne Melchior, a former minister and leading figure in the small
pro-Maastricht Centre Democratic party, yesterday said that he was prepared
to wager that in a couple of years Denmark would be knocking on the door of
the European Union.

FT  06 JUN 92 / Delegates muff throwaway lines
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE less than environmentally aware behaviour of participants at the Earth
Summit does not bode well for the meeting's outcome. The Rio Refuse
Collection Authority complained yesterday that people were ignoring the
signs and 160 special bins prominently placed throughout the centre asking
them to separate their litter for recycling. 'I wouldn't trust him to save
the planet,' grumbled one refuse collector as he watched an Australian
ecologist throw a large piece of pizza into the bin for recyclable material.
                       *      *      *
Bill Reilly, head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, continues to do
a valiant job in leading the US delegation to Rio. On Thursday night,
however, having just had his suggestions for a summit compromise rejected by
the White House, he let the smiling mask down for a moment. Asked if he
planned some eco-tourism in Brazil after the conference, the former World
Wildlife Fund head responded: 'Actually, the idea of going off faraway
somewhere birdwatching has rather an appeal right now.'
                       *      *      *
Cellphones are probably the most concrete example in Rio of technology
transfer from the industrialised world. Throughout the conference centre, in
corridors, meeting rooms and bars, are people standing speaking into their
black boxes, occasionally emitting impolite expressions of irritation as the
batteries run out. Cellphone users have even infiltrated the meditation
garden.
The secret to success with a cellphone is all about striking the right pose.
To make other less well-equipped participants (such as the French
delegation) turn really green one needs to capture that jaunty walk and
serious expression indicating that one is talking matters of state crucial
for the future of the planet and not let them hear that it is really an
order for pepperoni pizza and cold beer.
                       *      *      *
When world leaders gather next week for the climax of the world summit, who
will chair the meeting? The Brazilians had to deal with this tricky
question. And they found an age-old answer.
A huge round table capable of seating 126 people has been installed beside
the main assembly hall. But what if this is not big enough to handle the 180
delegations? 'They can all shove up a bit,' says a Brazilian official.

The German parliament is to speed the processing of asylum seekers and the

Asylum hearings will be limited to six weeks, rights of appeal reduced and

Although the new asylum regulations will come into force on July 1, doubts
were immediately raised about their effectiveness.
The Bundestag also passed new rules on the taxation of unearned income,
which must overcome stern opposition in the upper house, the Bundesrat,
before they can come into effect. The opposition voted against changes
raising the tax-free threshold on interest income to DM6,000 (Pounds 2,060)
a year for individuals and DM12,000 for couples.

UN inspectors left Baghdad yesterday after disabling part of Iraq's nuclear
capability but fearing it still had potential to develop a nuclear bomb,
Reuter reports from Baghdad.
The 25-man team, led by Greek expert Mr Dimitri Perricos, had already
announced it was taking with it Iraq's last stocks of highly-enriched but
unradiated uranium.
'Enrichment by electromagnetic isotope separation is out,' Mr Perricos said
in the Iraqi capital before leaving. 'The other side of enrichment by
centrifuge is still grey because we failed in our efforts to get the
procurement data from the Iraqis.'
The UN team spent nine days scouring Iraqi nuclear sites in a bid to resolve
doubts about Baghdad's nuclear programme.
Iraq refused to hand over data on companies and people who helped with its
nuclear programme, saying it was restricted by moral and other obligations
toward its contracting suppliers.

The Socialists won the majority of parliamentary seats in last Sunday's

a militant, armed party in the republic.
Rapid fragmentation of Mr Milosevic's support is also taking place in the

FT  05 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Italy agrees Qatar LNG deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY has made a preliminary commitment to go ahead with a major deal to buy
liquefied natural gas (LNG) from Qatar's extensive off-shore North Field.
Under a contract signed yesterday in Doha by the Qatar General Petroleum
Corporation (QGPC) and Snam, the gas development and transportation
subsidiary of ENI, Italy's state oil group, the Italians will study the
purchase of 8bn cubic metres of LNG a year, rising to 13bn cu. m. Some gas
could be sold on to other customers in Europe.
'This is just the beginning,' a SNAM spokesman said yesterday. 'However, our
track record shows when we initiate something we intend to finish it,' he
added.
The agreement yesterday envisages the creation of a joint company 65 per
cent-owned by QGPC and the remainder split between Snam and Enel, the
Italian state power-generating concern. Snam will be responsible for the
design, development, transport and sale of the LNG.
No price tag has been put on the deal but an agreement involving the sale of
similar quantities of LNG to Japan's Chubu Electric has been costed at over
Dollars 5bn at current prices. Of this, Dollars 2bn would go on a
liquefaction plant and Dollars 1.7bn on the construction of seven LNG
tankers. However, the liquefaction plant could also handle the processing of
Italian LNG exports.
Attempts by Qatar to develop its North Field have been handicapped by long
arguments over price.
Similar considerations aborted efforts by Iran in the 1970s to sell LNG to
Spain. Other problems concern transit through the Suez canal.
The Japanese originally envisaged exports to begin in 1997. but this target
has now slipped to at least 1999. Even so, the Italian project yesterday
talked of sales beginning in 1997.
Qatar last September awarded a Dollars 770m contract to Italy's Condotte
d'Acqua for the construction of a port at Ras Laffan, as part of the LNG
sales project.
Until now, Italy has been relying principally on Algeria for the supply of
gas and LNG. ENI decided recently to proceed with the construction of a
second gas pipeline under the Mediterranean, between Sicily and Tunisia, to
carry increased purchases of Algerian gas. There has also been talk of a
deal with Libya.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Hidden evidence deprived Judith Ward of fair trial
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE senior government forensic scientists 'took the law into their own
hands' and concealed evidence that could have cleared Miss Judith Ward of
IRA bombing charges at her trial 18 years ago, the Court of Appeal said
yesterday.
The court was giving judgment at the end of Miss Ward's appeal against
conviction for the M62 army coach bombing, in which 12 people died, and two
other explosions. Lord Justice Steyn said: 'On the scientific evidence
deployed against her, Miss Ward did not have a fair trial.'
Mr Douglas Higgs, the late Mr Walter Elliott and Mr George Berryman, all
employed by the Royal Armament Research and Development Establishment,
withheld material evidence that might have changed the course of the trial,
he said. They misled 'the prosecution and the defence in order to promote a
cause which they had made their own, namely that Miss Ward had been in
contact with nitroglycerine'.
The court formally quashed her convictions as 'unsafe and unsatisfactory'.
West Yorkshire police, who investigated the M62 bombing, Director of Public
Prosecution staff and counsel advising them, psychiatrists who provided
evidence about Miss Ward and the forensic scientists for the prosecution
were all heavily criticised by the court for withholding evidence.
Miss Ward was freed on bail three weeks ago after the Crown conceded that
her confessions and scientific evidence purporting to show that she had
handled explosives were unreliable.
Mrs Barbara Mills QC, the DPP, said afterwards: 'Disclosure is in the
forefront of prosecutors' minds. The public is rightly concerned, but the
circumstances and atmosphere of 18 years ago were quite different.'
The Home Office said it would study the judgment before deciding what
action, if any, should be taken against the government scientists.

US prices moved in a narrow trading range yesterday as investors and dealers
treaded cautiously ahead of today's important employment report for May,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 7.26 at 3,399.73. The
more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended slightly lower, down
1.33 at 413.26, while the Amex composite gained 1.53 at 397.18 and the
Nasdaq composite slipped 1.67 to 588.26. Turnover on the NYSE was 206m
shares.
Although there was steady two-way trade throughout the session, and certain
sectors attracted strong buying (most notably car stocks), the market's
attention was primarily focused on the May employment figures due out this
morning. The consensus of forecasts is for a rise in non-farm payrolls last
month of about 100,000.
The figure will be closely watched for its policy implications. A big rise
in payrolls will probably kill off any remaining hopes for another interest
rate cut, while an unexpectedly small increase, or decline in the number at
work, could prompt the Federal Reserve to ease monetary policy one more
time.
Among individual stocks, motor manufacturers were well-bid, the sector
buoyed by Wednesday's ten-day domestic car sales data which showed improving
demand for new autos. Ford rose Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 48 1/8 in turnover
of 2.8m shares, General Motors added Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 43 5/8 in 4m
shares, and Chrysler advanced Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 20 5/8 in 3.9m shares.
Coca-Cola eased Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 42 3/4 in heavy trading after
saying it was comfortable with estimates that it will earn between 42 cents
a share and 44 cents a share in the second quarter.
Also weaker were ITT, down Dollars 1 5/8 at Dollars 63 3/8 after Goldman
Sachs reduced its earnings estimates for the company's fiscal 1992 and 1993
earnings. Goldman's buy rating, however, was unchanged.
USX-US Steel rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 26 1/8 in turnover of 2.4m shares
after an issue of 7m additional shares of the common stock was sold at a
price of Dollars 25.50 a share. The size of the offer was raised at the last
minute due to strong demand.
On the Nasdaq market, Altera tumbled Dollars 2 1/4 to Dollars 13 1/4 after
the company said that the second quarter would not meet market expectations,
mostly because of competition from Cypress Semiconductors and slow business
in Japan.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed steady in moderate trading. According to preliminary
figures, the TSE 300 was off 3.92 points, or 0.12 per cent, to 3,403.42.
Declining issues led advances 296 to 245.
Volume was 29m shares, down from the previous 30.6m, and trading value fell
to CDollars 325.6m from Wednesday's CDollars 374.6m.
Nine of the 14 stock groups closed lower, with the biggest decline in the
consumer products group, off 1.08 per cent.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Golden Road back on Uzbekistan
trade map - One of the former Soviet Union's leading gold producing regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LAURA LE CORNU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ANCIENT Golden Road, one of the east-west trade routes across Central
Asia until the 16th century, is back on the trade map for profit takers.
Competition for gold reserves buried under the dusty steppes of the
Zerafshan valley in the former Soviet Republic of Uzbekistan has begun.
The Central Asian republic is supplying nearly a third of all production
since the collapse of the union. Uzbekistan assumed control of its own gold
in September last year, ending Russian domination of its rich mineral
resources since the 18th century.
The republic signed a joint venture agreement for gold production with the
US Newmont Mining Corporation in March.
The Dollars 75m venture marks the first foreign investment in its gold
industry, which produces about 70 tonnes annually. The Denver-based US
mining company aims to process about 10 tonnes of gold this year.
'We are highly developed in the field of mining, foreign investment has not
been necessary before,' said Mr Sadiq Safayev, first deputy at the Foreign
Affairs Ministry. 'But we have sought Western assistance for this particular
field of extraction.'
The republic is moving to encourage Western investment in order to develop
its backward industrial base. Under legislation introduced last year,
foreign investors are entitled to a two-year tax holiday, and free
repatriation of hard currency.
Gold is not the only resource the republic possesses; it is poised to make a
major impact on world commodity markets with its cotton production, and
following a large oil blow-out in March, will soon have its own crude.
Gold, however, tops the list and is far more easily transported from the
land-locked republic, which is at the mercy of the freight problems plaguing
the Commonwealth of Independent States following the breakdown of the old
Soviet networks.
'Uzbekistan's richest resource is gold', says Mr Valeri Nicholayaivich,
director of the republic's gold refinery at Zerafshan, where the ore
extracted from the nearby Besapan mine is processed. 'It will definitely
help Uzbekistan to pull out of the economic chaos now paralysing the former
Soviet republics.'
Yet a life-size portrait of Lenin still stands tall at the 25-year-old
refinery complex, located in the Kyzyl Kum (Red Sand) desert, 25 km (15
miles) outside the town, where the modern quarter, predominantly populated
by ethnic Russians, was created in the early 1960s to support the gold
mining industry.
More than 3,000 employees, an ethnic mix of nearly 70 nationalities,
including Uzbeks, Russians, Kazaks and Khirgiz, are employed at the
refinery.
'Under the Soviets, high salaries were offered to people to work here. This
is why I came,' said Mr Nicholayaivich, a Ukranian mining engineer, who
began working at the refinery almost as soon as it was commissioned.
'If you work hard, then the economy will thrive', reads a Russian language
sign, which hangs outside the building, sealed off to outsiders, where the
final stage of gold refining process takes place.
Pointing to a conveyor belt sprawling up the hillside of the mine, Mr
Nicholayaivich says modern Soviet-made technology and equipment are utilised
at Besapan. Moscow paid about 5 roubles for a gram of gold, compared with
about Dollars 12 on the world market.
Mr Nicholayaivich says gold reserves have been discovered in three nearby
areas in Murutau valley. 'I am sure if the government provides the necessary
technology, we shall be one of the greatest gold producers in the world,' he
claims.
Indeed, Uzbek officials are reluctant to reveal statistics of total gold
reserves, which they say are 'state secrets'. Yet, the authorities stress
the high quality of the republic's output. According to Mr Nicholayaivich:
'It is the purest, consisting of 99.999 per cent pure gold.'

FT  05 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: NZ fish industries enjoy a
bumper year - Higher exports and a weaker currency have helped to boost
profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY HALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW ZEALAND achieved a bumper harvest from its fishing and fish processing
industries last year, as well as from the farming of mussels, salmon,
oysters and scallops. The Fishing Industry Board says that total catch was
worth Dollars NZ1.1bn (Pounds 325m) in the year to December 31, while export
returns rose by 28.4 per cent to a record NZDollars 961.2m.
Mr Ray Dobson, the board's chief executive says the export sector is
continuing to perform strongly and will be a NZDollars 2bn-a-year industry
by the year 2000.
A number of factors came together to enable the industry to achieve a sharp
improvement from 1990, when it encountered difficulties because of low
international fish prices and a very high New Zealand exchange rate.
The industry's export competitive index shows that as the exchange rate fell
export prices rose. This coincided with a period of white fish shortages in
world markets, increasing prices. Input prices also dropped. In its annual
review, released May 28, the board says that the exchange rate will continue
to have a dominant effect on the industry, but the medium term outlook is
for the present favourable conditions to continue as the currency remains
low, world demand strong and domestic inflation low.
A sharp rise in the value of hoki, a deep sea white-fleshed fish, played a
key role in the bumper year, becoming the industry's top earner for the
first time with earnings up 126 per cent to NZDollars 156m. Exports rose to
49,202 tonnes from 33,961 tonnes in 1990 and returns per tonne were up 56
per cent to NZDollars 3,176. The board says the rise was in part due to
further processing in New Zealand.
While the volume of whole frozen hoki exported fell 35 per cent, the value
of frozen fillets sent overseas was up 50 per cent. Nearly 60 per cent of
the hoki went to the US, one of the highest paying markets. The board says
that the rising demand there is due to promotional work and the shortage of
cod, America's favourite white fish.
Orange fell to second place in exports. The volume was down 14 per cent to
14,349 tonnes, although this was worth only 4 per cent less at NZDollars
138.6m as the average export price rose from NZDollars 8,671 to NZDollars
9,657 a tonne. Most was shipped to the US. The board says the outlook is
promising as demand from the restaurant trade is expected to lift as the
American economy comes out of recession.
Total exports of rock lobster, or crayfish, rose substantially. While the
total volume rose only 5 per cent, Receipts were up 22 per cent to NZDollars
101.8m, and average returns rose from NZDollars 30,403 a tonne in 1990 to
NZDollars 35,941. Japan remained the largest market for rock lobster, taking
60 per cent by value. Much of this was sent live. The US bought substantial
quantities of frozen tails.
Concern has been growing about overfishing of rock lobsters. It is estimated
that illegal catches account for an extra 27 per cent above the officially
authorised quantities that can be taken.
Mr Dobson believes, however, that the new management plan worked out between
the government and the industry last year will promote a stock recovery that
will allow the rock lobster industry to enhance its position as a major
export earner. This plan agreed with recreational fishing interests and
Maori and conservation groups, has set new rules on the size of females that
may be caught, and on the netting size of pots to permit undersized
specimens to escape.
Snapper exports had a disappointing year, with both volume and value
remaining more or less static. Export volume was 6,604 tonnes, down slightly
from 6,729 tonnes in 1990, and exports were worth NZDollars 51.5m, compared
with NZDollars 49.4m. Most went to Japan, which took growing quantities of
live fish. Australia was another important market.
Squid exports fell sharply to 25,507 tonnes, compared with 33,981 tonnes in
1990, which was itself a very low figure. However the value rose slightly
from NZDollars 1,877 to NZDollars 1,821 a tonne. Mr Dobson says, however,
that the outlook for squid fishermen is brightening. Catches are expected to
rise in response to a new management plan and a 'cyclic' change in returns
is expected over the next two years.
Fish farming continued to thrive. Total export earnings rose 27 per cent
last year to NZDollars 69.3m, 7.2 per cent of the total for all seafood
exports. Volume rose to 13,813 tonnes. There was a dramatic increase in
exports of Greenshell mussels, the internationally copyrighted name carried
by the New Zealand product.
Overseas sales rose last year to 10,654 tonnes, worth NZDollars 42.1m, a 23
per cent rise on 1990. The review said that this growth showed the potential
that existed and could also be applied to a wide range of other species,
including products such as scallops, farmed lobsters, paua, prawns, snapper,
shrimp and crabs. Extensive research is being undertaken to find ways to
farm these species.
It is estimated that last year 43,600 tonnes of Greenshell mussels were
produced, including about 33,000 tonnes in the Marlborough Sounds and 10,000
tonnes in the Coromandel. That was a 22.5 per cent rise on the 1990 figure,
which in turn was 17 per cent up on 1989.
Last year 2200 tonnes of Pacific oysters were produced, a rise of 10 per
cent. Exports were worth NZDollars 7.4m.
New Zealand exported 2,250 tonnes of salmon last year, earning NZDollars
20m, up from NZDollars 14.1m in 1990. While substantial increases in world
supplies of farmed salmon are expected, New Zealand has secured important
niche markets with top quality products, the board says, and it expects this
to stand it in good stead in the years ahead.
Japan is New Zealand's biggest market for seafood in both volume and value.
Exports last year totalled 77,765 tonnes, worth NZDollars 290m. The US was
second taking 35,619 tonnes, up 22 per cent on 1990, worth NZDollars 253.7m.
Exports to Australia were worth NZDollars 102m, while the Republic of Korea
was in fourth place with purchases worth NZDollars 67.9m, up from NZDollars
35.4m. Other important Asian markets were Hong Kong, Singapore, Thailand,
while in Europe Britain and France were substantial customers.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Selling of European bonds balanced by
bargain-hunters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond markets ended above their lows yesterday as bargain-hunters
mopped up cheap paper. However, the recovery followed further concerted
selling, with Ecu, Italian and Spanish bond markets again bearing the brunt
of selling pressure in the after-shock of Denmark's referendum result.
Selling at the start of European trading gained impetus from substantial
overnight liquidation of European bonds by Japanese investors.
The Ecu bond market ended half a point lower, having sustained losses
earlier in the day of 1 1/2 points. For the second day running, the Ecu bond
futures contract on the Matif, the Paris futures exchange, had to be
suspended when the price fell its full 1 1/2 -point limit, but the market
subsequently recovered most of its losses.
In the run-up to the Danish referendum, Ecu bonds had been trading at yields
substantially lower than their theoretical yield levels based on component
markets: because of expectations that the market would benefit from monetary
union, investors were prepared to pay more for Ecu bonds than their basket
value would suggest. But following this week's sell-off, the spread between
real Ecu bond yields and theoretical yields narrowed to about 15 points, at
the 10-year area of the yield curve.
When valuing Ecu bonds, dealers are now likely to pay greater attention to
component bond markets, and the Ecu market may not be able to sustain a
premium to theoretical levels, according to analysts. However, there will be
natural support for the Ecu market at the theoretical yield level, according
to traders.
SPAIN, once one of the most popular high-yielding bond markets among those
investors hoping to benefit from the convergence of European interest rates,
dropped nearly one point but later picked up to close about 20 basis points
lower on the day.
Ten-year yield spreads of Spanish government bonds over German bunds have
widened dramatically in the last two trading days. The spread, which stood
at 286 basis points late on Tuesday, widened to 324 basis points yesterday
morning and ended the day at 313 basis points.
Traders warned that the peseta bond-German bund yield spread could widen
even further on fears that the Spanish government will be under less
pressure to meet the convergence criteria in future, and on concern that
there could be a realignment of the EMS currencies.
Italy's high-yielding government bonds also suffered heavy losses yesterday,
as traders focused on the country's economic problems. However, the market
made some recovery later in the day to close slightly lower. The yield
spread over 10-year German government bonds widened from 497 basis points on
Wednesday to 508 basis points yesterday.
GERMAN government bonds closed higher as dealers and investors continued to
shift out of the higher-yielding European bond markets and into D-Mark
assets in the wake of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht Treaty.
The Liffe bund futures contract, which opened at 87.73, climbed as high as
87.98 yesterday, before slipping back to 87.94 in late afternoon.
THE FRENCH bond market ended  1/8 point lower, having regained  1/4 point
after early losses, in active two-way trading. The French market held up
well, since it is considered one of the low-yielding markets, and a
potential beneficiary of a two-speed Europe, if France were to join an
advance party of European countries moving towards monetary union, as some
analysts suggest may happen. However, concern about a French referendum on
Europe announced on Wednesday is likely to inject a slightly negative note.
'It will be a summer of political uncertainty, against a background of
extremely encouraging economic fundamentals,' said Mr Kit Juckes,
international economist at SG Warburg. 'Occasional jitters are bound to
resurface.'
THE UK government bond market witnessed another day of turbulent trading,
particularly in the futures contract. However, traders reported some buying
interest as bond prices touched their lowest levels during the day and, as a
result, the market closed almost unchanged.
Volumes in the Liffe gilt futures contract were very high for the second
consecutive day at 67,000 contracts. The volume reached about 80,000
contracts on Wednesday, compared with a normal level of 18,000. The futures
contract opened at 98.13 and ended at around 98.16 yesterday.
In the cash market, the benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 opened at
116 21/32 and traded at 116 5/8 by late afternoon. Although the gilt market
fell quite heavily at the opening, traders noted buying interest once the
yields on long-dated issues moved above 9 per cent. The buying interest came
from UK investors, many of whom switched money out of Spain and Italy, the
higher-yielding European markets, into gilts.
'We expect to see a weaker trend in the gilts market until we get a much
clearer idea about what is happening (to Maastricht),' said one trader.
TRADING in US Treasury markets was subdued yesterday as investors held their
fire ahead of today's crucial employment report for May.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  1/32 at
101 13/32 , yielding 7.870 per cent. The two-year note was down 1/32 at 99
27/32 , yielding 5.192 per cent.
In the morning, the weekly jobless claims data, showing a 4,000 increase in
the third week of May, provided no clues as to how the May employment report
would look. Forecasts for today's numbers focus on a rise in non-farm
payrolls of about 100,000. Only if the rise falls well short of that, or if
payrolls show an absolute decline - which is highly unlikely - is there a
chance of the market making any gains.
Caution ahead of the afternoon's money supply figures was another factor
behind the quiet trading yesterday, although analysts did not expect the
market to display much reaction to the data, unless there is a dramatic fall
in M2 - the most closely watched measure of money.
JAPANESE government bonds edged lower yesterday, and dealers said the market
was likely to remain trading in a narrow range until the release of the US
jobs data for May today.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue opened at 5.48 per cent, traded in a
range of 5.47-5.505 per cent, and closed in Tokyo at 5.49 per cent.

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Bonds: National &amp; Provincial braves unsettled
sterling sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL &amp; Provincial Building Society yesterday braved an unsettled
sterling bond market to raise Pounds 100m capital with an issue of
long-dated, subordinated bonds.
The deal adds to recent heavy supply of subordinated debt from UK banks,
other building societies and insurance companies. The biggest issue of all
could be yet to come: if Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation wins its
bid for Midland Bank, up to Pounds 450m subordinated bonds will be issued to
Midland shareholders.
The paper offered yesterday carries a 10 3/4 per cent coupon and has a
maturity date in 2011. However, N&amp;P is likely to call the bonds after 14
years.
If it does not exercise the call, the coupon will be re-set to pay 225 basis
points over five-year sterling swap interest rate - a punitive level for the
issuer given that its cost of capital is currently around 60 basis points
over Libor on a swapped basis.
Investors were yesterday pricing the paper as if it had a 14-year maturity.
The bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed rate of 155 basis points
over long-dated government bonds. Hongkong Bank has said that it will issue
10-year paper at a yield spread 240 basis points over gilts.
Lead manager Samuel Montagu said that placement was restricted to UK
institutional investors such as life insurance companies with long-dated
liabilities.
The issue counts as Tier II or non-core capital for N&amp;P, which has only one
other subordinated debt issue outstanding, maturing in 1998. Under
regulations set by the Building Societies Commission, the industry
regulator, subordinated debt gradually ceases to count as capital five years
prior to maturity. Hence, the N&amp;Ps capital position will start to
deteriorate from next year and yesterday's issue was made to offset this
erosion of balance sheet strength.
Elsewhere, dollar and Canadian dollar sector continued to benefit from the
weakness of European markets. Toyota Motor Credit, the US consumer finance
arm of the Japanese car company, launched a Dollars 200m four-year deal.
Lead managed by Wood Gundy, the bonds were priced to yield 40 basis points
more than Canadian government bonds, seen as fair by participants in the
deal. Syndicate officials reported strong buying from European retail
investors.
Having been re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.50, the paper
traded up to 99.65 bid, where the yield spread over government bonds was 39
basis points.
The flow of Eurodollar floating rate note issues continued, with Credit
Lyonnais of France and Unibank of Denmark raising Dollars 250m and Dollars
100m respectively.
Both deals were lead managed by Merrill Lynch and offered unusually high
margins over Libor. The Unibank paper pays a margin of 105 basis points, but
is subordinated. The Credit Lyonnais notes pay a margin of 37.5 basis
points, but subject to an fixed cap.

THE New Zealand government yesterday announced the sale of NZDollars 500m
(USDollars 269m) worth of mortgages on state-owned homes, marking a
significant withdrawal of government support for people on low incomes,
writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
The government is selling a tranche of mortgages to Postbank, a subsidiary
of the ANZ Bank, and the Mortgage Corporation of New Zealand. They are to
buy some 20,000 mortgages between them, each paying NZDollars 250m.
The government said it was open to offers for the remaining mortgages held
by the state-owned Housing Corporation. It said all that had been sold were
prime rate mortgages charging market interest rates.

THE HONG KONG government has approved a lengthening of the settlement period
on the colony's stock market to two days after a trade from the current
one-day period to cope with huge turnover, Reuter reports from Hong Kong.
Mr Robert Nottle, the chairman of the Securities and Futures Commission,
told a news conference that the change would be announced officially this
weekend. Daily turnover has soared during recent weeks, occasionally rising
above HKDollars 6bn (Dollars 775m).
Mr Nottle noted that the number of transactions has totalled 50,000 or more
a day recently, compared with about 20,000 usually. He said the change
should not increase the risks of trading in Hong Kong.

takeovers still unanswered

<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSOB, Italy's stock market and companies watchdog, yesterday fleshed out
some of the missing parts of the country's new laws on public share
offerings and takeover bids for quoted companies, passed earlier this year.
However, many crucial questions, such as the detailed conditions for
triggering a takeover bid and precisely how such a transaction would work,
remained unanswered.
The continuing lack of such information has unsettled the Milan stock
market. After a brief speculative burst based on hopes that the new rules,
which are supposed to protect the rights of minority shareholders in quoted
companies, could push up the values of some stocks, interest has once again
dwindled.
Under the new rules, which went into effect in early March, Consob had a
three-month limit to clarify information requirements for public share
offerings - which it has now done.
But details about takeover bids did not face the same deadline, and have
still to be resolved. The new takeover law, passed in haste by Italy's
outgoing legislature, has been criticised by brokers as imperfect and
difficult to interpret. But a Consob official yesterday could give no
indication when the rules might be clarified.
Simint, the quoted clothing company controlled by financier Mr Francesco
Micheli and designer Mr Giorgio Armani, is raising L60bn (Dollars 48.8m)
through a capital increase.

MR JAVIER De la Rosa, the enigmatic Catalan financier who masterminded a
Dollars 2bn industrial and property investment programme in Spain by the
Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) in the late 1980s, resigned last night as
deputy chairman of Grupo Torras, KIO's Spanish holding company.
Mr De La Rosa's decision appears to sever his links with KIO and leaves him
free to pursue an ambitious personal investment programme. Spanish
television reported last night, however, that senior KIO figures were hoping
to fly from London to Barcelona today to persuade him to stay with Torras.
KIO's intentions in Spain have not been clear since the end of the Gulf war,
and it has frequently been suggested the group might want to disinvest in
order to help pay for Kuwait's reconstruction. Whatever the case, Mr De la
Rosa's departure would be a massive blow should the Kuwaitis want to stay on
in Spain and, equally, would badly complicate an orderly retreat from Spain.
Torras owns controlling stakes in the biggest domestic chemicals group, and
Ercros, the country's largest foods group, Ebro.
Mr De la Rosa, though, has more recently been constructing his own empire.
He has 25 per cent of a successful local TV channel and last year bought
Spain's largest leasing company, CNL. He sold the leasing portfolio and
merged CNL with a leisure group, Tibidabo. Earlier this year he also bought
10 per cent of a profitable regional bank, Banco de Ibiza, which controls
half of a Catalan bank, Banca Catala.
More pointedly, he has been buying heavily into Ebro, and currently owns
around 20 per cent of the group.
He is also a large shareholder in Ercros and is seeking government
permission to sell control of its loss-making fertiliser and mining
divisions to Freeport MacMoRan of the US.

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: HK telecoms accord raises profit
doubts
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE HONG Kong govern-ment's new regulatory agreement with Hongkong
Telecommunications has left the company worse off, according to local
analysts. They say the accord has failed to remove uncertainty over future
regulation of its key international telecoms business.
The measures announced this week could open Hong Kong's domestic telecoms
market to increased competition after 1995.
The two parties agreed to change from profit control of domestic business to
'incentive regulation', by applying an 'inflation minus 4 percentage points'
formula to domestic pricing of services.
However, an agreement by Hongkong Telecom to cut its international telecom
rates by 12 per cent over three years has captured the Hong Kong stock
market's imagination.
The price reduction in the first year will be 8 per cent, followed by a 2
per cent cut in each of the following two years.
These changes are unlikely to come into effect until early next year because
laws must be amended first. The delay may insulate this year's earnings, but
further on it will have a negative impact.
'The company is in for a period of much slower earnings growth,' said Mr
Andrew Harrington, a member of Salomon Brothers' global telecoms team.
He said the government's statement that it would look again at Hongkong
Telecom's international pricing in three years meant there was still
uncertainty over the company's share price.
This was denied by the company. Mr John Tonroe, finance director, said the
company believed any uncertainty over regulation was now out of the way. He
did, however, agree that Hongkong Telecom's profits would be hit.
The problem with Hongkong Telecom is that it is already one of the world's
cheapest carriers. So although in the US and Europe there might be big
volume gains from price cuts in Hong Kong, those gains might be smaller and
take a longer time to show through.
The accompanying chart gives three scenarios showing the effect of faster or
slower growth in volumes as a result of the price cuts. It assumes the price
reductions will not be introduced until next April.

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: May sales improve for top US
retailers
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANY leading US retailing groups yesterday reported improved sales figures
for May, despite unseasonably cold weather, adding fresh evidence of slowly
improving consumer confidence and economic recovery.
Wal-Mart, the rapidly-expanding discount chain which is now the largest
retailer in the US by sales, reported a 12 per cent rise in same-store
revenues compared with May 1991. With its new outlets added to the total,
sales shot up 27 per cent to Dollars 4.44bn.
Rival discounter K mart reported a 1.8 per cent increase in comparable store
sales and an overall rise of 6.7 per cent, to Dollars 2.92bn.
Mr Joseph Antonini, chairman, said: 'The gain was achieved despite
colder-than-normal weather that adversely affected a number of important K
mart discount store spring businesses, most notably apparel and our outdoor
garden shop.'
However, JC Penney, the department store and catalogue group, reported a
sharp advance in clothing sales throughout the US as it reported an 8.8 per
cent increase in comparable store sales, and an overall increase of 9.8 per
cent, to Dollars 882m.
Sears, Roebuck, the Chicago-based stores and catalogue group, produced a 0.3
per cent increase in like-for-like sales and a 1.1 per cent increase in
total sales, to Dollars 1.71bn.
It said there were increases in major appliances, home office equipment and
furniture, 'continuing the trend started in January and indicating improving
confidence in the economic recovery as consumers undertake major purchases'.
But it added that the weather meant large sales declines in seasonal
products, such as lawn and garden equipment, air conditioners and some
clothing lines.

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: Extremely flexible legislation
used for officer's appointment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CANADIAN courts took an unprecedented step by appointing Mr Bernard
Wilson as 'information officer' when Olympia &amp; York filed for protection
from its creditors under the Companies' Creditors Arrangement Act.
No previous example of this post exists, but the legislation under which he
was appointed is extremely flexible.
The Act, passed in 1933, proved popular during the Depression. It then fell
into dis-use, but has seen a resurgence during the last few years. It runs
to only a few sections in the law books and has left the courts considerable
discretion in how to operate the procedure.
Mr Wilson's appointment is one example of this flexibility, and comes as a
direct response to complaints from creditors to O&amp;Y about lack of
sufficient, up-to-date financial information.
The CCAA restructuring allows O&amp;Y's management to remain in charge of the
companies as the 'debtor in possession'. Creditors are sub-divided into a
series of different voting classes, and a negotiating process with them
begins under court supervision.
Once the debtor has drawn up a reorganisation plan, it must be approved by
three-quarters of the creditors by value in each class. The original CCAA
petition granted the management until July 13 to file their plan with the
court, and a further 60 days to gain creditors' approval - although these
dates are likely to be extended. The plan needs to be approved by the court.

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: HKSB emerges as leading creditor
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, which is bidding to take over
Midland Bank, was revealed yesterday as Olympia &amp; York's biggest creditor,
with a total exposure of at least USDollars 780m and collateral worth far
less than the principal amount.
A bulky document filed by the debt-ridden Canadian property developer with
the Ontario Court of Justice also identifies several Japanese banks among
O&amp;Y's most generous lenders. Six Japanese institutions are the biggest
participants in a USDollars 500m term loan led by Citibank of the US and
secured by O&amp;Y's shareholding in Carena Properties, a property holding
company which itself is in financial trouble.
The document details all borrowings by Olympia &amp; York Developments (the main
holding company of the owners, the Reichmann family) and the 28 Canadian
subsidiaries which sought court protection on May 14.
The debt of these companies totals about two-thirds of O&amp;Y's total debt of
CDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 6.2bn) but does not include direct loans to Canary
Wharf in London's Docklands or to the company's 20 or so buildings in the
US. Two British banks, Barclays and Lloyds, have a substantial direct
exposure to Canary Wharf.
O&amp;Y's biggest lender was previously assumed to be Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, which last week disclosed an exposure of CDollars 860m. HSBC
provided USDollars 750m (CDollars 903m) of a Dollars 2.5bn loan negotiated
in 1989. In addition, Hongkong Bank of Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary,
advanced CDollars 32m in demand loans.
The security for the jumbo loan consists of O&amp;Y's stakes in Abitibi-Price
and Gulf Canada Resources. Mr Alain Tuchmaier of McLean McCarthy in Toronto
calculates the current market value of the shares pledged to HSBC at only
CDollars 588m.
The most heavily exposed Japanese banks are Tokai and Dai-Ichi Kangyo. Tokai
provided half of the Citibank-led Dollars 500m term facility. Dai-Ichi
Kangyo put Dollars 180m towards the jumbo loan.
According to Mr Tuchmaier, the security provided for the Citibank loan is
now worth CDollars 173m, less than a third of the principal amount. Japanese
institutions are also known to have lent heavily to several O&amp;Y properties
in New York.

<TEXT>
MARTINKA Coal, a US subsidiary of the UK-based Hanson group, said yesterday
it would pay around Dollars 165m to acquire a coal mine and reserves from
Southern Ohio Coal.
The purchase, which includes the assumption by Hanson of Dollars 26m of
liabilities, will see Hanson strengthening its US coal holdings through
Peabody Holding, a Hanson US subsidiary that controls Martinka Coal.
Hanson said that Dollars 62m would be paid when the deal closes in July,
while a further Dollars 77m would be paid out over the next 13 1/2 years.
The transaction also calls for Ohio Power, the electric utility that owns
Southern Ohio Coal, to agree a 20-year coal supply contract with Hanson's
Peabody subsidiary. Ohio Power is one of seven US utilities owned by
American Electric Power.
Peabody will provide Ohio Power with about 2.5m tonnes of coal annually for
a 20-year period.
The acquisition includes an underground coal mine, a coal preparation plant,
more than 60m tonnes of seam coal reserves and related equipment and
reserves.

auction of developer's assets

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
J. P. MORGAN, the leader of a banking syndicate that last month said it
would foreclose on part of a Dollars 160m loan to Olympia &amp; York, yesterday
postponed a planned auction of O&amp;Y assets until June 18.
The postponement of the auction - of an interest rate swap that had been
pledged by O&amp;Y as collateral on the Dollars 160m loan - was seen in New York
as a possible indication that the bank group and O&amp;Y were negotiating a
possible settlement.
J. P. Morgan has been in an uncomfortable position ever since it announced
the auction, which was first set for May 22 and then delayed until
yesterday. This is because the New York bank is both a financial adviser to
O&amp;Y and a creditor with an estimated Dollars 50m of total loan exposure to
the developer.
O&amp;Y, which is in technical default on several New York mortgage loans, is
struggling to keep its US properties out of bankruptcy court. The group
needs at least Dollars 30m of cash above and beyond its present US income
stream if it is to service its debt obligations and avoid the need to file
for protection from US creditors under Chapter 11 of US bankruptcy law.
The possible settlement being discussed with the J. P. Morgan-led bank
syndicate could involve O&amp;Y making a payment on the Dollars 160m outstanding
loan.

FUJI Photo Film of Japan suffered a 10.4 per cent fall in consolidated
pre-tax profits to Y87bn (Dollars 681m) for the half-year to April due to
higher costs and increased competition.
Overall, sales rose 2.7 per cent to Y563.3bn. Operating profits, however,
declined 4.9 per cent to Y84.2bn due to a 6.3 per cent rise in sales costs
and a 19 per cent increase in research and development costs. After-tax
profits fell 16.9 per cent to Y40.2bn.
Fuji's non-operating profits plunged 67.6 per cent to Y2.7bn as a result of
a decline in interest and dividends received.
For the full year to October, Fuji forecast a 13.5 per cent fall in
after-tax profits to Y82bn on a 2 per cent rise in sales to Y1,140bn.
Du Pont Merck Pharmaceutical of the US and Banyu Pharmaceutical of Japan are
to form a new company in Japan to develop and market Du Pont Merck products
there, AP-DJ reports from Wilmington.
Terms of the deal were not disclosed.
Du Pont Merck said: 'Japan represents more than 20 per cent of the world
market for pharmaceuticals. In order to achieve our vision of being a
worldwide, research-based pharmaceutical company, we must participate in the
Japanese market.'

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: Accountant opens the books on a
secret life - Bernard Simon visits the information offices of the
beleaguered property company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NONDESCRIPT office on the 28th floor of Toronto's Exchange Tower shows
just how much life has changed at Olympia &amp; York in the past three months.
Furnished with a few library-type tables, a large photocopying machine and a
row of bulky filing cabinets, the room is one of three O&amp;Y 'information
offices', where creditors of the once-secretive developer can now pore over
its most sensitive financial data.
The information offices - the other two are in New York and London - are
part of a two-pronged effort by O&amp;Y to win the confidence of banks and other
lenders as it seeks to reschedule its CDollars 13.5bn (USDollars 11.20bn)
debt.
The other leg of O&amp;Y's belated willingness to open its books is the
appointment of Mr Bernard Wilson, a partner at Price Waterhouse in Toronto,
as 'information officer', to liaise between the company and its creditors.
Mr Wilson's position is unique in a corporate restructuring. However, it
reflects creditors' concern in the early days of O&amp;Y's troubles that the
developer was reluctant to change its secretive ways.
Several lenders complained after their first meeting with the company on
April 13 that information contained in their briefing books was sketchy and
out of date.
The job went to Mr Wilson, an avuncular 49-year-old accountant, partly
because of his own expertise in corporate restructurings, and partly because
Price Waterhouse has worked as O&amp;Y's auditors for the past 11 years.
The information officer's job was created under the same May 14 court order
which gave O&amp;Y protection from its creditors under Canada's Companies
Creditors Arrangements Act. His role has been clarified in subsequent court
rulings.
Mr Wilson thus has jurisdiction only over data pertaining to the parent
company, Olympia &amp; York Developments, and its Canadian assets, which
together account for about two-thirds of the company's total debt.
He can demand information on O&amp;Y's US buildings or Canary Wharf only insofar
as their affairs are relevant to creditors of the parent company. He says he
and his team have so far fielded about 50 requests for information.
Although O&amp;Y's secrecy has been stripped away, he still has to contend with
the fact that the Reichmann family firm has never had an internal reporting
system geared to inquisitive outsiders. Unlike public companies, for
instance, O&amp;Y's financial managers have not been accustomed to compiling
monthly reports for directors' meetings.
Price Waterhouse is only now completing its audit of O&amp;Y's books for the
year to January 31 1992. The figures should be available by the last week of
June.
Mr Wilson hopes to be able to answer many of the enquiries by referring
questioners to the information rooms. Documents now available there include
O&amp;Y's debt agreements, its land and tenant leases, and appraisals of its
properties. However, visitors require either Mr Wilson's or the company's
permission, and are required to sign confidentiality agreements.
Mr Wilson's job will also be made easier with the setting-up of about half a
dozen creditor committees, representing O&amp;Y's 91 bank lenders as well as
dozens of holders of publicly-traded securities.
Reports to these committees will probably be synchronised with the monthly
reports which Mr Wilson will draw up on O&amp;Y's receipts and disbursements.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: 'Tactical error' by Lloyds as arbitrageurs
gather - Price rises 10p to 467p as 18m shares traded, three times the
normal volume
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INSTITUTIONAL shareholders in Midland Bank believe Lloyds Bank may have made
a tactical error in its effort to acquire its smaller rival by not
immediately announcing a new, higher bid to cap that offered on Tuesday by
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank.
The Lloyds board is meeting today and is expected to improve on its existing
Pounds 3.9bn proposed offer, announcing enriched terms which will become a
formal bid if its approach is cleared by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission in August.
The enhanced bid from HSBC has encouraged arbitrageurs to buy Midland
shares. Because arbitrageurs buy shares for short-term profits, not
long-term gains, they are expected to tender the shares to HSBC and could
tip the scales in favour of the Hong Kong-based bank.
Midland's shares yesterday closed 10p higher at 467p, with 18m shares traded
 -roughly three times the normal volume. Market sources also said that HSBC
had apparently been buying shares in recent days and may have accounted for
as much as a third of yesterday's activity. HSBC's stake in Midland stood at
15.9 per cent yesterday morning.
HSBC's new bid offers speculative investors the opportunity to buy shares
with a guarantee that they will be purchased later at a higher price.
The new offer values each Midland share at about 480p. When it was first
announced on Tuesday, Midland was trading at 452p.
Shareholders said the mechanical difficulties of conducting a classic
arbitrage between HSBC and Midland shares had dampened activity until now. A
classic arbitrage would have encouraged shareholders to sell HSBC shares
short while buying Midland at a lower price. Eventually, the shares would be
transferable to HSBC at a higher price.
However, UK institutions generally report difficulties with selling foreign
stocks short and on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, shares may not be sold
short. If they are sold short in London, settlement periods are far longer
than those in Hong Kong where shares must be paid for two days after the
transaction. By comparison, Midland shares bought in London on Thursday do
not have to be paid for until the end of the current account period on June
22.
Shareholders said that much of the arbitrage activity in HSBC and Midland
shares was occurring in New York markets where it is possible to sell short
the American Depositary Shares of HSBC. With settlement periods for a short
sale of HSBC and a purchase of Midland shares coinciding, the transaction
becomes easier to complete.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Fed grants Hongkong Bank application
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Federal Reserve has rejected an attempt by Lloyds Bank to use the US
banking laws to block Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's bid for
Midland Bank.
The central bank has granted HSBC's request for temporary authority under
the 1956 US Bank Holding Company Act, to acquire Midland, and thereby engage
indirectly in non-bank activities in the US. Lloyds had made submissions
opposing the request.
In its judgment, the Fed said that 'the information presented by Lloyds does
not compel denial of the application'. While reserving the right to review
the situation, it added that Lloyds could file an application in pursuit of
its counter-bid for Midland on the same basis as HSBC, the presumption being
that it would also be granted.
'The board has determined,' the Fed said, 'that HSBC would not derive any
material competitive advantage over US bank holding companies as a result of
this acquisition.' Nor had HSBC engaged in any 'impermissible conduct' in
the US.
It said that the transaction would occur 'substantially outside the US and
is proposed predominantly for reasons unrelated to the US'. Midland, it
said, had only 3 per cent of its global assets in the US.
Noting that UK authorities had not objected to the HSBC bid, 'the board
believes that it is in the public interest to limit the effects of US
regulation on an essentially foreign transaction, provided, as in this case,
that the exemption does not grant substantial competitive advantage to the
foreign organisation or have other adverse effects in the US'.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Boots at bottom of expectations - High
hopes for new heart drug but costs will depress profits in short term
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Boots, the pharmaceutical and retail group, dropped 23p to 467p
yesterday as the group reported annual profits at the bottom end of
expectations and told analysts the cost of bringing Manoplax, its new heart
drug, to the market.
Pre-tax profits for the year to March 31, excluding profits on property
sales, rose 7 per cent to Pounds 359.5m. Property sale profits added another
Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 13.4m). Group sales were 2.5 per cent higher at Pounds
3.66bn.
Sir Christopher Benson, chairman, said the group was 'extremely pleased'
with the results. He said that econo-mic recovery was slow but there were
'some encouraging sales increases' which gave him some optimism for the
year.
Sir James Blyth, chief executive, said that bringing Manoplax to the market
would depress profits in the pharmaceutical division in the short term,
although in the longer term the group had high hopes for the drug.
The company aims to spend an extra Pounds 15m-Pounds 20m in the current year
on recruiting and training the sales force and will increase its R&amp;D
spending on the drug too.
The pharmaceutical division increased profits by 5 per cent to Pounds 120.8m
on turnover 11 per cent higher at Pounds 699.2m.
Much of the business is overseas, however, and before exchange rate effects
profits were more than 13 per cent higher.
On the retail side, the Boots the Chemist chain increased trading profits by
7.6 per cent to Pounds 246.2m on sales 4.7 per cent higher at Pounds 2.47bn.
This took the chain's net margins to 10 per cent, nearly double the level of
five years ago. Return on capital employed in the chain is 57.1 per cent.
Boots' other retail formats, such as Halfords, Do It All and Childrens
World, turned in a combined trading loss of Pounds 5.3m compared to a profit
of Pounds 27.3m. Many of these businesses were acquired when Boots took over
Ward White in 1989 for Pounds 900m.
Sir James said that these businesses were affected by the economic
recession. Halfords, the car parts and bicycle retailer, lost Pounds 10.5m
(profit Pounds 2.8m).
Sir James said its car servicing business lost more than that while the
shops were profitable. The other main loss maker was Childrens World, losing
Pounds 6.7m (loss Pounds 4.7m), which Sir James said had yet to reach
critical mass.
The property division increased trading profits from Pounds 60.1m to Pounds
69.5m, including the profits on property sales.
Interest charges fell from Pounds 65.1m to Pounds 43.1m and central costs
were down from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds 13.9m. Net borrowings were cut by
Pounds 109.7m, of which Pounds 41.7m represented convertible bonds switched
into shares, to Pounds 362.3m. This left gearing at the year end of 25.3 per
cent (37.3 per cent).
Earnings per share rose to 26.4p (24.2p). An increase of 8 per cent to 8.1p
in the final dividend 1p is proposed to give a total of 12.4p (11.6p).

FT  05 JUN 92 / A ticket on the road to European growth: Why a German
venture has bought Thomas Cook
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER and CHRISTOPHER PARKES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMAS COOK was a man of firm convictions who knew an opportunity when he
saw one.
A firm teetotaller - who began his career in 1841 by running one-shilling
temperance tours around the UK - he had no difficulty in turning a blind eye
to clients under the influence of drink, believing their loutish behaviour
would convert other passengers to more sober habits.
Such pragmatism would surely lead him to acknowledge the logic behind the
Pounds 200m sale of Thomas Cook Group to LTU, Germany's largest charter
airline carrier and the third biggest package tour group.
It is no secret that Thomas Cook has not fulfilled its potential under the
20-year stewardship of Midland Bank. Saddled with more pressing problems
during the past decade - such as the disaster following the purchase of
Crocker Bank in the US and Third World debt - Midland has had little time or
money to devote to expanding the UK's best-known travel agent.
That friendly neglect is about to change and industry analysts suggest that,
lodged in a happier home, Thomas Cook is set for expansion in Europe, where
profit margins are substantially higher than in the UK. Cook's, even with
its 1,600 outlets in 120 countries - 340 of them in Britain - has 'barely
scratched the surface' of the growing travel market in continental Europe,
said one analyst.
Mr Peter Middleton, the chief executive brought in by Midland in 1987 to
revive the company, agrees that expansion is the way forward. 'The
management has a very clear idea of where it wants to go,' he says. Happily,
his plans will now be possible, since LTU is seeking to develop its business
out of Germany. Even more happily for Mr Middleton, he and other senior
management will stay on to direct the expansion. Nor are any group
redundancies planned.
Other suggestions are that Thomas Cook could return to the ranks of larger
tour operators. Cook's refuses to confirm such speculation 'but we cannot
rule something like that out if you look at our ownership,' said a company
spokesman.
The deal could also open the way to Thomas Cook regaining its US businesses
which, under a law forbidding banks to own travel agents, it was forced to
sell when Midland bought Crocker in 1980. Thomas Cook in the US is a
completely separate company, however, and no approaches have been made.
Indeed, Mr David Paresky, chairman of Thomas Cook Travel US, was anxious
yesterday to stress that the sale in no way affected his company.
For LTU, the deal is an important move in its strategy to develop a
full-range, internationally based travel organisation.
The 47 Thomas Cook outlets in Germany will add another five percentage
points to LTU's 16 per cent share of tour operation. Cook's will bring 11
per cent of the Pounds 10bn (Dollars 18bn) UK leisure market and 14 per cent
of the Pounds 3bn UK business travel market.
Thomas Cook's international network of foreign exchange bureaux and the
travellers' cheques business - about 50 per cent of profits - will also
bring a new dimension to LTU's offering and sit nicely with Westdeutsche
Landesbank. Germany's third-largest bank, which owns 34 per cent of LTU,
will hold 10 per cent of Thomas Cook after the sale.
LTU, a private Dusseldorf-based company, is run by former carnival prince Mr
Hans-Joachim Driessen. With 28 aircraft, 18 less than four years old, the
group runs Germany's second-biggest airline after the state carrier
Lufthansa. Half its passengers come from the group, 25 per cent from other
travel agents and the rest from flight-only bookings.
LTU's existing travel agencies, including Jahn, Tjaereborg and Meiers, span
all market sectors. So-called 'incoming agencies' in the US, Caribbean and
Asia complete the chain. The company's Nile cruisers carry customers to see
the Egyptian pyramids and its collection of resort hotels stretch from Sri
Lanka to the Dominican Republic.
Progress has been rapid since the arrival of Mr Driessen. His early ambition
to get into the holiday clubs market was achieved last September when LTU
announced a 50-50 joint venture with France's Club Mediterranee.
Other projects include services such as golfing tours or educational trips
which are showing annual growth of 10 per cent or more in the German market.
According to Dresdner Bank, tourism is set to overtake motor manufacturing
as the world's second-biggest industry. Although it is still a long way
short of this level inside Germany, there are no signs of slackening demand
for aircraft tickets.
Longer term, LTU will come to market. According to the WestLB, the group is
to be converted to a joint stock company later this year in preparation for
flotation in the late 1990s.
Meanwhile, LTU insists that Thomas Cook will be run as a completely separate
entity. 'We like it as it is,' a spokesman said yesterday. Such sentiments
would appeal to the original Mr Cook, whose hard-won success with the
travelling classes eventually brought him the title 'Grand Courier
Extraordinary to the Human Race'.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK bank accepts MiniScribe payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD CHARTERED Bank yesterday agreed to a Dollars 62m (Pounds 34m)
out-of-court payment in the US from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm,
and other defendants following the collapse of MiniScribe, a computer
disk-drive manufacturer.
Total settlements arising out of MiniScribe are now believed to be the
largest ever against an auditor after Coopers last month made a separate
out-of-court payment.
This class action suit, brought by bondholders in MiniScribe in Texas,
initially resulted in punitive damages of Dollars 550m, including more than
Dollars 200m against Coopers as auditors to the company. That decision was
overturned by the judge, but Coopers later agreed to an out-of-court payment
believed to be between Dollars 40m and Dollars 50m.
Standard Chartered lent Dollars 120m to MiniScribe in 1988. The company
later filed for bankruptcy protection, and the bank alleged fraud and
negligence on the part of the defendants since 1986.
The bank, which brought legal actions in Colorado, said yesterday it would
recover its initial loan as a result of the settlement and realisations of
assets made from MiniScribe.
Undisclosed portions of the settlement will come from Hambrecht &amp; Quist,
investment bankers, Mr QT Wiles, chairman of MiniScribe, and Ellco, a
leasing company.
Mr Martin Hayman, head of legal services at Standard Chartered, said: 'The
result was the right result. We are not happy but are satisfied it is the
best for our shareholders.'
Coopers will be expected to provide payment from its US partnership. If
funds are insufficient, its partners are personally liable for the
difference.
Mr Harris Amhowitz, deputy chairman and general counsel for Coopers &amp;
Lybrand in New York, denied any culpability in the firm's audit of
MiniScribe.
'Nevertheless, the firm agreed to settle to avoid the uncertainties of
successive jury trials.'
The Dollars 62m settlement is subject to US court approval, but Standard
Chartered said it expected that to be a formality.
A Dollars 338m settlement for Standard Chartered against Price Waterhouse
was awarded by an Arizona jury last month, relating to the bank's purchase
of United Bank of Arizona in 1987 for Dollars 334m. Price Waterhouse is
still considering its response.

<TEXT>
MIDLAND BANK yesterday announced the sale for Pounds 200m of Thomas Cook,
one of the oldest names in the travel industry and the inventor of the
traveller's cheque, to Germany's third-biggest package tour operator, LTU.
Midland said the sale was unconnected to the Pounds 3.9bn recommended
takeover bid for the bank by Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation. It
said Hongkong Bank was informed in advance and was happy for the sale to go
ahead.
The announcement that Midland was selling the travel agent and financial
services group was greeted with some surprise in the travel industry, where
a deal had not been expected until after the bid was resolved. However, it
had been known for 18 months that Midland had planned to sell Thomas Cook as
it regarded it as a non-core asset.
Thomas Cook runs 1,600 outlets in more than 100 countries. Midland, which
bought Thomas Cook from British Rail in 1972 for Pounds 20m, expects to
report a net extraordinary gain of Pounds 99m. The proceeds will be used to
develop core businesses.
LTU, and its 34 per cent shareholder, Westdeutsche Landesbank, will acquire
90 per cent and 10 per cent of Thomas Cook respectively. Although the deal
has been referred to the European Commission for standard approval, both
parties said it was unlikely to meet any obstacles.
LTU is the only group in Germany offering charter flights and tour packages.
In addition to its large tour operation, LTU is Germany's largest charter
airline carrier. Operating profits last year were DM68m (Pounds 23.3m) on
turnover of DM2.5bn.
Mr Peter Middleton, chief executive of Thomas Cook, said a five-year
contract based on a percentage of turnover was being negotiated.
He and other senior managers will stay, and the group does not expect any
redundancies. Thomas Cook will continue to run bureaux de change in 103
Midland branches in Britain.
Arthur Andersen, the administrators of the private side of the collapsed
Maxwell empire, are discussing the sale of their 50 per cent shareholding in
Thomas Cook USA. The possible buyer - the US individual who owns the other
50 per cent of Thomas Cook USA - is understood to be the only party to whom
the administrators are speaking.

HANSON, the Anglo-US con-glomerate, and Bechtel, one of the world's top two
engineering and construction companies, are discussing the possibility of
combining forces over their approach to Canary Wharf, the insolvent office
project in London's docklands.
Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries in the US and Lord Hanson's
partner, yesterday said: 'There is a possibility that we might establish a
joint venture in our approach to Canary Wharf.'
Hanson is considering making a bid for the project, which was put into
administration last week by Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian-based property
developer.
In San Francisco, a spokesman for Bechtel said a representative of the US
group's property development and investment division had 'a preliminary
conversation with the Hanson group' a few days ago about Canary Wharf.
Bechtel said the discussion concerned how Bechtel Park Towers Limited
(BPTL), the property and investment division, 'might assist Hanson as it
considers the Canary Wharf project'. The services it might provide would
include development and property management services.
Hanson is also talking to Bechtel about the possibility of redeveloping
Hanson's Kaiser cement works on the Permanente Site, near San Jose in the
San Francisco Bay Area.
While the talks are still at an early stage, Lord White said Hanson might
establish a big property arm if the talks prove conclusive. 'There are a
number of interesting property bargains around which we may be interested
in,' he said.
Bechtel had 1991 revenues of Dollars 7.5bn and an order book at year-end
that totalled Dollars 7.2bn. BPTL has been active as developer/manager in
projects such as the construction of the 27-storey US federal courthouse in
lower Manhattan.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
UK ADMINISTRATORS of the collapsed Maxwell empire are pursuing a legal
action in New York to try to obtain details on millions of dollars of assets
they believe were transferred to Liechtenstein-controlled companies from
Headington Investments and other Maxwell companies.
The US legal filing was made by Arthur Andersen which serves as joint
administrator of the private side of the Maxwell businesses. It represents a
stepping-up of efforts to unravel the web of companies and Liechtenstein
entities.
The action, which began with a filing in March and has only now come to
public attention, is a US extension of action already taken in the UK. It
also demands that Mr Sheldon Aboff, the former chief US aide to the late Mr
Robert Maxwell, be ordered to answer questions.
Mr Aboff's appearance which, along with the entire filing, was contested by
his lawyers during hearings late last month, was requested as part of the
administrators' search for Maxwell company funds they believe were
transferred to companies controlled by the Liechtenstein-based Maxwell
Foundation.
The administrators believe the fund transfers occurred both before and after
Mr Maxwell's death last November.
The news of the action came as Maxwell pensioners in the UK intensified
their campaign to persuade MPs to change the law to limit the losses faced
by thousands of pensioners. They want to become creditors with a call on
Maxwell assets.
Although not named in court, two companies - Pergamon Holdings (US) Inc, a
US company controlled by Swico Anstalt, a Liechtenstein company that is part
of the Maxwell Foundation, and Sphere Inc, a California computer games
business also controlled from Liechtenstein - are the focus of the legal
action.
The original petition - filed on March 10 under a section of US bankruptcy
law allowing a non-US representative to seek US court assistance - was made
in the US bankruptcy court of New York southern district.
Judge Tina Brozman has given both sides until June 19 to file papers
supporting their cases.
New details emerged yesterday about the London office of a
Liechtenstein-controlled company with links to the Maxwell family which the
Financial Times discovered has been used by the Maxwell brothers, Kevin and
Ian.
Completion of a leasing agreement between Hazelmere Estates, owner of a
building at Wardrobe Place, off London's Ludgate Hill, and Sphere was
confirmed on May 11. Mr Robert Maxwell bought an 80 per cent stake in Sphere
which is held by the Liechtenstein-based Maxwell Charitable Trust.
Both Hazelmere and Sinclair Goldsmith, the estate agents acting for
Hazelmere, have made it clear that at no stage prior to the signing of the
agreement did they suspect Sphere was linked to the Maxwell family.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADING industrial countries closed ranks at the Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro yesterday in the face of developing countries' demands for more aid
to clean up the environment.
Environment ministers from the Group of Seven countries affirmed that any
extra money they provided would have to be channelled through the World
Bank's existing global environment facility, and not through a new
multi-billion dollar Green Fund, which developing countries favour.
Mr David Maclean, the UK environment minister, said the G7 had made 'a
strong commitment' to the global environment facility, though there was no
discussion of how much money donor nations would give or whether they would
even make the commitment in Rio.
The tough G7 stance followed a meeting late on Wednesday called by Mr Klaus
Toepfer, the environment minister of Germany, which is chairing the G7.
In contrast the Group of 77 developing countries are demanding both the
creation of a Green Fund outside the control of the World Bank, and changes
to the way the global environment facility is managed.
Ministers from the G77 held their first formal meeting at the Earth Summit
last night to agree a common position, which was expected to include a tough
stance on seeking commitments from the industrialised world on technology
transfer and finance.
Mr Anwar Saifullah Khan, environment minister of Pakistan, which is chairing
the G77, said before last night's meeting: 'I would consider the conference
a failure if it did not result in these commitments because it would
indicate that the developed world is not serious.'
Mr Khan stressed that aside from financial commitments, the need to reduce
trade protectionism was also likely to be a main theme in the G77
discussions.
Finance is fast becoming the main conference issue. A conference committee
on finance has been created, chaired by Mr Rubens Ricupero, Brazil's
ambassador to the US, and discussions were initiated yesterday afternoon on
the institutional framework and the quantities of money required to
implement summit decisions.
The G7 countries also agreed yesterday to concentrate their joint efforts in
Rio on an agreement to protect forests. This seemed to be a concession to
the US, which has made it clear that it has strong reservations about many
other issues on the summit agenda and sees little point in pursuing the
debate.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Abu Dhabi warns on BCCI payout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Abu Dhabi shareholders in the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce
International yesterday warned creditors that the offer of at least a 30 per
cent payout was final and there would be no other.
'These arrangements represent the result of over six months of discussion
with the liquidators, who best know the factual situation within BCCI, and
who have recommended the arrangements to creditors. The arrangements,
including the amounts to be paid under them, are not open to renegotiation,'
the shareholders said in a statement.
However, the shareholders appeared to be heading for a conflict with a group
of creditors, representing at least 10 per cent of the bank's worldwide
claims, who have voted to risk litigation in an effort to secure better
terms. Among other things, the group is also unwilling to surrender its
right to sue the government of Abu Dhabi as called for in the offer.
The group has been advised by solicitors Norton Roise who had urged caution
in accepting the offer. The solicitors noted that the offer is worthy of
consideration by creditors, because, although far from generous, there are
grave risks in attempting to recover through litigation.
Seven of the BCCI Creditors' Committee's eight members have voted to reject
the proposed settlement, according to a document obtained by the Financial
Times. The sole supporter is the Bank of England-backed Deposit Protection
Board whose members have paid levies to a fund which reimbursed UK
depositors for losses of up to Pounds 15,000 each.
The Creditors' Committee has been seeking to delay a move by liquidators to
obtain High Court approval to accept the settlement offer made to it by the
Abu Dhabi shareholders. Yesterday, they suffered a further setback when Sir
Donald Nicholls, the vice chancellor who has been presiding over the
settlement hearings, paved the way for the liquidators to appear before the
High Court on Monday.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Arts: Falstaff - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY and RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At the Coliseum Mark Elder conducts Verdi's last opera with great fluency
and even passion, though when the music must wear a magical delicacy he
achieves that too. This is a revival (with support from Mrs Donatella Flick)
of David Pountney's 1989 production. Amongst the entire cast - none of them
bad - there is a general air of eagerness to please, and they attacked the
all-in final fugue with enough exuberance to make a satisfying end. So far,
so good; but not good enough. Readers who have already booked seats may
prefer to stop reading NOW.
Marie-Jeanne Lecca's designs are as unappetising as ever. Though there are
coy hints of Elizabethanry in both the peculiar costuming and her basic set
 -a central tower which contains Falstaff's snug at the Garter Inn in its
hollow and rotates boringly, and three sides of skeletal house-fronts
numbered 1 to 8 with mail-slots - the effect is wilfully scatty. It removes
any sense of period or of place (not Windsor, not even England: Miss Lecca
hails from Romania), from an opera where those things fix the terms of the
action. By the time we get to the nocturnal denouement in Windsor Forest, it
hardly matters that the rustic spookery is rendered in pinball-era lighting
effects.
In fact the Windsor locals are garbed as Suburbanites from Hell, or from
Outer Space. The respectable 'merry wives' are squeezed into bizarre little
dresses and large bonnets, Mistress Ford's dangerously jealous husband into
a ludicrous gangster-suit which denies him either bourgeois dignity or
paternal menace. As so often now, Mistress Quickly's lower social status is
erased, though Anne Collins sings her with the right fruitiness - and as
much broad, sitcom mugging-to-the-audience as everybody else. Pountney's
great gifts as a producer have never extended to eliciting humane detail
from his operatic actors.
When Falstaff is thus reduced to featherweight farce, the subtle insights of
Verdi's masterly score cannot register. His characterisations-in-a-phrase
pale away if Falstaff is only a loon, the merry wives are never flirting
with real danger, and the young lovers' plight amounts to no more than a
temporary embarrassment about how to tell Daddy. From Malcolm Donnelly's
blunt Ford, you would never have guessed that his anguished Act 2 soliloquy
can make a powerful concert-piece.
At first sighting Benjamin Luxon's Falstaff looks ideal, but thereafter he
takes the role no further than an amiable old buffer's bemused innocence.
His reactions are never gross, nor seriously choleric; neither does he
overween or bluster. Instead of the Falstaff we know and cherish, he is
somebody quite similar but much nicer - and infinitely duller. The Luxon
baritone no longer carries a Falstaffian weight; still, it would have made a
sharper impression if his singing pitch had been less often vague or
indeterminate. Donnelly's Ford suffered from that too, and Terry Jenkins' Dr
Caius.
Susan Bullock and Yvonne Howard make sturdy merry wives, without any
shadings to notice. Alison Hagley's Nannetta looks too modern and knowing
for her music, but sings it with grace; better still her tenor swain, though
Bonaventura Bottone's visible persona - flash and spivvy, a stand-up comic -
is weirdly wrong. All the other ENO principals have been here before,
neither better nor worse.
Though turning the Verdi-Boto Falstaff back into English might seem a bonus,
the language is an insuperable problem. For all the resourceful wiles of
Amanda Holden's translation, there are just too many pungent phrases that
Verdi composed irrevocably in Italian. Syllable for syllable, they refuse to
go into natural English with anything like the pithy eloquence that inspired
Verdi's setting - but hasn't touched the performers here.
While Falstaff brings ENO's season to a close, the Royal Opera is in the
middle of its busy summer schedule, writes Richard Fairman. The production
of I Puritani, which won general approval when it opened a few weeks ago, is
still in repertory, a stalwart try at Bellini's difficult English Civil War
opera, driven along with combative vigour and not a small degree of noise
from the pit.
Into the thick of the melee for the last two performances has stepped a new
and delicate heroine Elvira. Sumi Jo has been having a busy time at Covent
Garden, first with her faultless mechanical doll Olympia in Les Contes
d'Hoffmann, then as Adina in L'elisir d'amore. The role of Elvira takes her
a lot further and, at times, right to her limit. The voice is pure but
small, and trying to dominate the ensemble at the end of Act 1 left her with
not an ounce of tone to spare.
Nevertheless, she stayed the course and used her resources cleverly to best
effect. The coloratura was fluent if not dazzling; the lyrical solos were
shaped with real musicianship, even when there was not the range of colour
or force to drive an important line home. As a petite, girlish Elvira, she
knows how to hold the stage and was by no means overshadowed by the more
domineering among her colleagues.
I Puritani does not come round often and this adds up to a decent enough
performance of it to warrant a visit. There is one last chance to catch the
show tonight.
Falstaff remains in repertory at the English National Opera to June 20

FT  05 JUN 92 / Arts: Dire Straits - Pop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Dire Straits are deeply unfashionable. You can't make so much money over so
many years appealing to the Woking classes without getting it in the ribs
from urbane critics. The fact that the band dresses like a bunch of window
cleaners gives the criticism some weight.
For Earl's Court, on yet another leg of a global sweep (with sponsors
Philips adding more weight to their wallets), they made no attempt to
convert the unconvinced. This was a performance relaxed to the point of
inertia.
Even the jokes were laid back: near the end, after the first jangling bars
of 'Money for Nothing', leading Strait Mark Knopfler shook his head, folded
his arms, and pretended to go on strike. The rest of the group was
spotlighted, swinging their legs, drinking ale, equally reluctant to perform
the most celebrated anthem to pop excess. What a tease] Within a minute they
were back to work, churning out one of those infectious melodic lines which
make Dire Straits accessible but chunky.
Knopfler can afford the
best backing musicians and Chris White on saxophone and Paul Franklin on
steel guitar fleshed out the sound, occasionally to the point
of excitement. The problem is that Knopfler's output as a composer is
variable. A decade or so ago every song was a coconut; now there are some
dodgy walnuts among them. It's always roughly the same sound but the version
from the days of 'Sultans of Swing' and 'Romeo and Juliet' is so much more
enjoyable than the later work in which Knopfler shows off his newly acquired
social conscience.
But for all the blandness Dire Straits are polished and professional. It is
a criticism that you find yourself watching Knopfler on the screen, where
close-ups catch his fingers magically milking the frets, rather than the
long distance static view of the man live. His guitar virtuosity seems as
God-given as Clapton's: and, within limits, Dire Straits are prepared to
have fun. 'Sultans' was given a performance that was almost minimalist, with
Knopfler biting off the lyrics, and
the band embroidered some of the melodies with improvised snatches of
everyone from Diana Ross to Wayne Shorter.
Dire Straits have always delivered to the format, and there was little
tedium in a set that generously extended two hours. There was little
mind-blowing passion either, but that's not the band's bag. This was pop
music's answer to a double bill of Beethoven and Tchaikovsky, excellent for
corporate entertainment and for sending the audience out whistling the
tunes. Ideal in fact for the start of the London Season.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Lords war trials defeat for
government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and IVOR OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government suffered its first defeat of the parliamentary session
yesterday as peers voted to ensure that televised overseas evidence could
not be used in war crimes trials in Scotland.
By 121 votes to 80, the Lords supported a move led by Lord Campbell of
Alloway to put war crimes trials outside the scope of the clause in a
Scottish legal bill enabling live television links to be authorised as
evidence.
The defeat is the first one since Lord Wakeham became leader of the Lords.
With its majority in the Commons cut to 21, the government may now find that
overturning defeats from the Lords is not the largely straightforward
business that it was in the previous parliament.
Lord Campbell, a Tory, was the leader of the Lords revolt last year against
the legislation allowing war crimes trials to be held in the UK. It led to
the Commons having to impose its will on the Lords in the rarely used
procedure in the parliament acts 1919 and 1949, after the upper House had
twice refused to accept the bill.
He said it would be 'impossible' for someone accused of war crimes to get a
fair trial if television links from abroad were used, because there would be
no proper cross-examination before a jury.
Live television links can be used in England and Wales.
In the Commons yesterday Mr John Major, the prime minister, denied that the
delay in reintroducing the Asylum Bill showed that its original purpose had
been to 'legitimise' scare stories about immigration during the general
election, Ivor Owen writes.
The charge was made by Mr Roy Hattersley, the deputy Labour leader, who
recalled an undertaking by the government that the bill would be among the
first measures in the new parliament.
He pressed the prime minister to explain why the bill was so urgently needed
before the election but not so urgently needed afterwards.
When Mr Major promised that the bill would be reintroduced 'before too
long', Mr Hattersley accused him of 'characteristically evading' the
question because he was ashamed to give the real answer.
The prime minister also reaffirmed that MPs would soon be asked to approve
the bill. 'We intend to resist the misuse of asylum procedures and also
intend to ensure genuine refugees are properly protected,' he said.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Change in overseeing of financial
regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RESPONSIBILITY for regulating financial markets and non-bank financial
services will shift to the Treasury from the Department of Trade and
Industry next week, nearly three months after the change was foreshadowed in
the Conservative manifesto.
The move will bring together responsibility for overseeing wholesale
financial markets, such as those for foreign exchange and gilts, and
wholesale investment markets, such as those for stocks and bonds.
It will necessitate the transfer over the weekend of about 50 DTI officials.
It is understood that the move was delayed by legal difficulties.
The government's proposals have given rise to a series of questions in the
City about the future regulation of London's financial markets.
In particular, they have fuelled a belief among some regulators that the
Bank of England will eventually become more involved in overseeing all
London wholesale markets.
Mr Anthony Nelson, economic secretary to the Treasury, said in April that
the shift reflected developments in financial markets. 'The barriers between
the different industries are crumbling.'
Mr Nelson also argued that the switch would give more weight to the UK
financial sector's views on the international stage.
Negotiations are in train within the EC over the remaining measures needed
to flesh out areas of common supervisory practice, with directives on
capital adequacy and deposit protection high on the Brussels agenda.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Assets identified by receiver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECEIVER to Robert Maxwell's personal estate has identified assets
totalling several million pounds that might be claimed by creditors of the
business empire, it emerged yesterday.
Most are subject to claims by other parties, though, while investigations
into any possible funds held through trusts in Liechtenstein have proved
extremely difficult.
Mr Peter Phillips, a partner in Buchler Phillips, the accountancy firm, the
court-appointed receiver to Mr Maxwell's estate, is to appear before Mr
Justice Ferris next week to discuss his attemptsto trace assets held by the
family.
He was appointed by the court after Mirror Group Newspapers issued a writ
against Mr Maxwell's estate in December for sums it claimed were owed to the
group.
Mr Phillips said yesterday: 'We have traced an amount not in the tens of
millions of pounds.' Assets found include bank accounts and several
relatively small shareholdings.
Mr Maxwell held a stake of more than 15 per cent in the Bank of Sofia in
Bulgaria. He also had about Pounds 16,000-worth of shares in both P&amp;O and
Ansbachers, as well as holdings in US corporations.
He was a Lloyd's Name on a number of insurance syndicates and a member of
the Outhwaite action group, which received a Pounds 116m settlement in
February, now being distributed. His estate will receive his portion of the
settlement without any deductions to settle his outstanding obligations to
Lloyd's.
Mr Phillips emphasised that there were other 'third party claims' on many of
the assets, including from Arthur Andersen, the accountancy firm, who are
administrators to the private Maxwell companies.
He said he was unable to discuss the position of assets held through
Liechtenstein. 'We have not broken through the webs of confidentiality.'
While the personal assets of Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell, Robert Maxwell's
sons, have been frozen, it is not possible to do the same to someone who is
deceased. Mrs Betty Maxwell, his widow, may also have independent assets
outside the control of the receiver.
Mr Phillips has submitted two reports to the court detailing assets
identified and their value. The second was submitted about five weeks ago
and is still being considered by the judge.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ashdown praises PM treaty effort
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PADDY ASHDOWN, Liberal Democrat leader, yesterday praised Mr John Major
for trying to ensure that the Maastricht treaty survives.
But Mr Ashdown will attempt to provoke a wide-ranging policy debate in his
party, to include consideration of its stance on the future of Europe.
In a speech in Bristol tomorrow, Mr Ashdown will propose that Liberal
Democrats put more emphasis on a decentralised and politically accountable
Europe. Maastricht was too much of a treaty for politicians, not
individuals, he believes.
In a letter to the prime minister yesterday, Mr Ashdown said that he had
'severe reservations' about Maastricht. 'We regard the treaty's failure to
address Europe's democratic deficit as a crucial deficiency; we believe that
the treaty has signally failed to address the issue of subsidiarity.'
Mr Ashdown reiterated his commitment to ever closer European union, though,
describing Maastricht as 'a transition mechanism to a deeper and wider
Europe, not an end point in itself'. He was heckled in the Commons this week
over his stance.
Aides said he would not want to dilute his commitment, but European
Community institutions needed to be more people-friendly.
The speech tomorrow will follow Mr Ashdown's call last month for an
anti-Tory alliance, which would include Liberal Democrats. That was also
intended to provoke discussion among Liberal Democrats over the party's
strategy and policy in the wake of its election performance, ahead of its
autumn conference.
Mr Ashdown has already faced criticism from within the parliamentary Liberal
Democrat party for trying to push the internal debate ahead with unnecessary
haste.
Mr Ashdown will float ideas for policy initiatives across a broad range of
areas, including health, education, the economy and taxation.
He has already hinted that he wants the Liberal Democrats to back a
substantial shift away from the taxation of income and towards the taxation
of resource use.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: European fault line unearths
divisions - The mood in a much divergent Labour camp
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR George Robertson, Labour's staunchly pro-Community European spokesman,
was touting his solution to the Danish question on a crumpled postcard
yesterday.
It read: 'Danish referendum Number Two: Do you agree to change your mind on
the Maastricht treaty?' Underneath were two boxes - both marked: 'Yes.'
Mr Robertson's chuckles could not disguise the fact that the crisis has
provoked a reassessment of the policy quandaries facing his party. Last
month, the party leadership had to watch some 60 of its MPs defy a
three-line whip and oppose the second reading of the Maastricht Bill.
Now the Danish decision can only be expected to widen what Mr Robertson
concedes is a 'European fault line that runs through both parties'. Party
business managers agree that on Europe, they have little control over the
rank and file. Moreover, there is a growing momentum behind the view that
Labour should press for a referendum if the government persists in pushing
on with the ratification process.
With Labour freed from the pre-electoral discipline demanded by the outgoing
leadership, its internal divisions over Europe are potentially as
wide-ranging as those of its Tory opponents. They are just less on public
view.
The parliamentary party's position is further confused by tactical
considerations over how to maximise Labour's advantage in the Commons and
the additional complication arising from the leadership election still
rumbling on in the corridors and tearooms or Westminster.
Nonetheless, the jubilation with which the result of the Danish vote was
greeted among some backbench Labour MPs indicates that internal opposition
to the leadership's firmly pro-EC line is more deeply seated than might
initially have seemed the case.
And while the pure anti-community fundamentalists may count for little more
than 20 or so of Labour's 269 MPs, many more would agree with those such as
Mr Nigel Spearing who said: 'It is possible the high tide of centralist
European thought in the Labour party has now been reached.'
Yesterday Mr Robertson - known to his opponents as 'The Ambassador from
Strasbourg' - was more cautious. He suggested that the first requirement
before any policy conclusions are drawn was to ascertain the legal status of
the treaty: that is, whether it is now dead or not.
Others believe there is a new opportunity to prosecute Labour's vision of
Europe.
A motion tabled by prominent 'soft-left' MPs last night - most of them
avowedly pro-Europeans - called for the reopening of talks on the largely
monetary criteria for economic convergence.
That view was echoed by Mr Bryan Gould, who argued in a speech to his
constituency that the terms agreed, and endorsed by Labour, were 'seriously
defective' and would hand Europe over to the non-accountable 'exclusive
control of central bankers'. Later he said Labour should vote against the
Maastricht bill if it returned to the Commons.
Mr John Prescott, the deputy leadership contender, said that the Maastricht
treaty was dead and that the UK should now pursue a free-trading Europe of
nation states.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maxwell MPs to inform ombudsman of
DTI role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs CAMPAIGNING on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners will submit to the
parliamentary ombudsman that the Department of Trade and Industry knew that
the Investment Management Regulatory Organisation (Imro) felt unable to
carry out its duties adequately but did not take full account of those
concerns.
The MPs are preparing the submissions after a statement from the ombudsman,
Mr William Reid, making clear how far his jurisdiction extends in the
context of the plight of the Maxwell pensioners.
Mr Reid said that he was not able to entertain complaints against the
Securities and Investments Board or Imro.
He added, however, that if there was evidence that the DTI had ignored
representations about the adequacy of regulations, then that might be
something he could consider.
Any evidence that the DTI's licensing of London Bishopsgate Investment led
to losses by the pensioners could also be considered.
His clarification was welcomed by Mr Richard Page and Mr Frank Field, the
joint chairmen of the all-party group campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell
pensioners, as a helpful move forward. Mr Page said that members of the
group would be drafting submissions that addressed the specific points
raised.
Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, said that Mr
Reid's statement might well be of assistance to the pensioners and their
representatives.
His Labour-sponsored debate in the Commons next Tuesday will focus on the
need to implement part of the Social Security Act 1990, which provides for
pension schemes where the liabilities exceed the assets to be regarded as
creditors of the parent company.
In the Lords yesterday, Lord Henley, a junior social security minister, said
the government was 'very actively considering' implementing the provision.
He warned, however, that powers were limited and offered no guarantee of the
return of missing assets.
The pensioners' campaign group has written to the 398 MPs who have
constituents caught up in the Maxwell affair, urging them to support early
implementation of the section.
Mr Meacher will also concentrate on the need for immediate help for the
Maxwell pensioners through enabling funds to continue paying pensions while
the assets are being pursued.

After all three contenders had spoken to the union's annual conference in

each for his rivals, Mrs Margaret Beckett and Mr Bryan Gould.
For the leadership itself, the left-leaning union, representing some 2.3 per

FT  05 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tory rebels see a turn of the tide
 -Where the anti-federalists go from here
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I TOLD YOU so. The refrain echoed around the corridors of the House of
Commons yesterday as the Conservative party's Euro-sceptics celebrated the
threatened collapse of the Maastricht accord.
For Mr John Major, it was a reminder that the divisions in his party over
Europe had been submerged rather than banished by his skilful negotiations
in December.
After the lengthy spell in the political wilderness that followed the
enforced departure of their mentor, Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the opponents of
closer European integration were claiming that the tide had at last turned
in their favour.
The 23 Conservative MPs who defied Mr Major last month to vote against the
Maastricht treaty were claiming that another 50 or so were ready to demand a
renegotiation of the deal on political and economic union.
Led by veteran anti-federalists like Mr William Cash, Mr Teddy Taylor and Mr
Michael Spicer, they backed their claim with a parliamentary motion bearing
the signatures of 70 colleagues who were ready to call for a 'fresh start'
to map out the future of Europe.
The rebels were confident that by today the number would reach close to 100.
Privately, some junior members of the government were adding their voice to
the assessment that the careful consensus that Mr Major had built up around
the Maastricht accord was now shattered. 'There is a feeling of liberation
around the place. The agreement is dead,' one said.
He added that up to a dozen Euro-sceptics within the government were
planning to convey that message to the prime minister through the party's
managers at Westminster.
The party's managers were more sanguine, emphasising that the Danish
decision had created an over-excited mood, particularly among new MPs.
Senior ministers were quick to point out that the motion - signed by around
20 of the new intake - was not an outright repudiation of Maastricht. Its
call for a new direction for the EC during the British presidency was easily
reconcilable with Mr Major's determination to put the completion of the
single market and enlargement at the top of his agenda.
The prime minister meanwhile emphasised his view that any attempt by Britain
to re-open the deal in the wake of the Danish referendum would carry as many
hazards as potential benefits.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, Mrs Gillian Shephard, the employment
secretary, and Mr Peter Lilley, the social services secretary, were said to
be among those arguing that the second thoughts in the rest of Europe
represented a belated vindication of Britain's negotiating stance.
They were joined by others in pointing out the risks of a sizeable Tory
rebellion if Mr Major was seen to be trying too hard to rescue a treaty that
Britain had never sought. After all, the Irish or the French could yet sink
it permanently.
So the message from the party managers was that the government would pause -
probably until after the Lisbon summit - before retabling the legislation to
implement the treaty. By then, they hope there will be a deal with Britain's
partners to rescue the accord - and a more soberly realistic mood among the
government's supporters.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Reinsurer to sue over losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LEADING European reinsurer is to take legal action in an effort to recover
losses of more than Fl 500m (Pounds 153m) made in 'spiral' reinsurance
business underwritten in Lloyd's of London.
Spiral reinsurance - in which companies and syndicates reinsure each other's
exposures to catastrophe risk - has already caused considerable controversy
at Lloyd's, where hundreds of Names - the individuals whose assets back
underwiting at the London market - face financial ruin as a result of losses
by specialist spiral syndicates.
Amsterdam-based Nederlandse Reassurantie Groep is taking the action after
running up heavy losses at its Victory subsidiary, which it bought from
Legal &amp; General in 1990.
NRG alleges that its advisers in the transaction - Ernst &amp; Young, the
accountants, Bacon &amp; Woodrow, the consultant actuaries, and Swiss Bank
Corporation, the investment bank - failed to advise the company about
Victory's exposure to claims from marine and aviation reinsurance
transactions.
The Dutch company claims: 'The advisers failed properly to assess the
account and failed to issue any warning about the possible extent of the
shortfall at the time of acquisition.'
NRG paid L&amp;G Pounds 120m for Victory in July 1990. Subsequently the Dutch
company has been forced to set aside some Fl 500m in extra provisions as
claims from insurance policies underwritten before the transaction have
emerged. The company has suffered a series of catastrophe losses.
Mr Willem Dikland, chief executive, said NRG would be seeking substantial
damages, probably in excess of Fl 500m. Mr Dikland indicated that NRG might
not have bought Victory had it been aware of the scale of the exposures.
Allison &amp; Humphreys, the solicitors, expect to issue writs this month.
Mr Colin Lever, senior partner at Bacon &amp; Woodrow, said the firm would
'vigorously resist' any action. Swiss Bank Corporation said it had not been
required to provide advice on Victory's reserves. 'It is a matter of
surprise and regret to SBC that it has been named in the action.'

FT  05 JUN 92 / GEC to shed further 825 jobs and close factory
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 800 defence-sector jobs were cut yesterday by GEC in Chelmsford,
Essex. The company blamed competition and the transfer of manufacturing to
other countries.
Marconi Radar and Control Systems, a defence electronics contractor,
announced the closure of a factory with the loss of 600 jobs.
In a separate statement, GEC-Marconi Communications, which designs and
manufactures civil and military communications systems, said it was shedding
225 jobs.
The cuts are the latest stages in a restructuring of GEC's defence
activities, which shed about 5,000 staff last year, about 10 per cent of the
workforce.
Yesterday's losses at Marconi Radar came in spite of a series of orders won
by the company recently. Many of the contracts have been with Third World
and Pacific rim countries that insist on some local manufacturing.
The deals are typically worth at least Pounds 10m each and are for products
such as a new long-range radar and surveillance system.
The company said it would concentrate its UK manufacturing at factories in
Fife and Leicester. There would be some transfer of production from
Chelmsford, but no jobs added at either site. The Chelmsford factory will
shut by December.
After the 600 redundancies, 1,400 people will remain employed in research,
sales and administration.
GEC-Marconi Communications said its 225 redundancies were the result of
'heavy competition, particularly overseas' and came after a review of costs.
The competition in equipment made by the company, such as satellite ground
stations and microwave communications systems, comes from international
telecommunications giants including Siemens of Germany and SGS-Thomson of
France.
GEC shares rose 1 1/2 p yesterday to 221 1/2 p. Mr James Ross, of
stockbroker Hoare Govett, said: 'The job cuts are in response to poor market
conditions and should feed through to better margins for shareholders.'
They were, however, described as 'disastrous' by Mr Bill Pigram, area
secretary of the AEEU engineering and electrical union. 'This is another
bitter blow for the defence industry,' he said.
Both subsidiaries said they were trying to find alternative work for those
affected, within GEC and elsewhere.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Business school row fuelled
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSINESSMAN who chairs Manchester University's council yesterday accused
the 14 private-sector leaders who resigned last week from Manchester
Business School's council of betrayal. He claimed they had been 'led astray'
about their role by Professor Tom Cannon, the school director.
Mr Chris Kenyon said a new business school executive board would be formed,
with the chairman and a majority of lay members from industry and commerce.
That would give 'practical effect' to a better partnership with the private
sector.
The school council's lay members resigned over an alleged lack of plans for
such a partnership. They wanted the school to become autonomous and not
federated with management education and research in the University of
Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist) and the university's
department of accounting.
Mr Kenyon, chairman of William Kenyon &amp; Sons, a Cheshire ropes and webbing
manufacturer, formerly chaired the business school's finance and general
purposes committee for seven years.
He said an advisory body was actually in charge rather than the old school
council. 'Members of the school council were led astray by the director, who
saw himself as chief executive of an independent organisation,' he added.
'Lay members with little or no sympathy for academic processes found this
simple 'business-like' concept attractive.'
That led the council to assume a more executive style, although it met only
three times a year. The school was run by its director, dean and professors.
The new board would have executive powers, with defined responsibility to
the university, which was legally and financially accountable for the
school. 'It is the nearest thing to autonomy a university can offer,' Mr
Kenyon said.
Many business school members have privately complained this week of a
breakdown in communications during negotiations over the new structure. They
say there is now broad support for it - as well as widespread belief that
many school council members misunderstood what was on offer.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Fall persists in factory investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTMENT spending by British manufacturers will continue to fall this year
but will rise in 1993, according to the Central Statistical Office's spring
survey of manufacturers' investment intentions.
All industries except chemicals and mechanical engineering are expected to
invest less, with a fall of 2 per cent on last year predicted.
Biggest declines are expected in metals, food, drink and tobacco.
Respondents to the latest survey account for about a tenth of the capital
expenditure of the manufacturing industries.
Britain's longer leading index, which pinpoints turning points in economic
activity about 10 months in advance, rose 0.7 per cent in April to stand at
104.7.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Manx taxation reform planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE of Man plans to reform the taxation of companies owned by
non-residents that conduct business outside the island, in an attempt to
attract international holding companies.
About 4,000 companies are registered on the island as exempt companies. They
are owned and carry on business outside the island; they pay an annual fee
of Pounds 250 and are not taxed on profits. No island resident may have a
shareholding in such a company, but each company must have a Manx-resident
director and company secretary.
New legislation will extend the range of exempt companies to include
Manx-registered public companies. The Isle of Man Treasury said that would
allow island residents to hold a limited number of shares, but emphasised:
'We will not allow any Manx resident to shelter income in these companies.'
The new category of international companies will pay a minimum tax charge
equivalent to the current annual fee. There will be flexibility to have a
specific rate of tax applied, up to 20 per cent, which the island's
authorities say may be more appropriate for an international corporation
with a fixed global tax policy.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Guide to company status for societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUILDING Societies Commission, the industry regulator, has issued
guidelines for societies that want to shed mutual status and become
companies.
Although the commission says the guidelines have been issued without any
specific event in mind, their detailed nature has caused surprise and
aroused speculation in the mortgage industry that the sale of a small
building society to an outside buyer might soon be actively discussed.
The commission says societies must keep up-to-date registers of members with
voting rights and must be able to produce documentation from the Bank of
England that its application for a banking licence will be approved.
It also sets out the fees a society will have to pay for making use of the
commission's time.
The tone of the letter, sent to all building society chief executives,
treats the possibility of demutualisation in straightforward terms. That is
a shift away from the commission's attitude in the late 1980s when it made
little secret of its distaste for the shedding of mutual status.
Two top-10 societies are believed to be contemplating stock market
flotations, although probably not for another 18 months to two years. The
front runner is widely thought to be Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the
sixth-largest society.
The guidelines may ease fears that a society attempting to convert would
have to run a gauntlet of complex legal and administrative difficulties.
The most likely institution to buy a small building society is Bank of
Edinburgh, a retail banking group set up two years ago to buy small and
medium-sized societies.
Last autumn, Bank of Scotland and Bank of Ireland are both believed to have
put out feelers to buy Town &amp; Country Building Society, but decided to
withdraw after discovering the legal difficulties involved and the need to
match possible liquidity support provided for Town &amp; Country by the building
society industry.
Building societies have had powers for four years to switch from mutual
status and become companies, subject to the approval of a majority of their
members. So far, there has been only one such conversion - Abbey National's
stock market flotation in July 1989.
Building societies are not the only mortgage institutions on the market.
This week JS Gadd, the issuing house, set up a company to package the UK
mortgage operations of small banks and insurance companies wanting to
withdraw from the market. Gadd finds buyers for the mortgage portfolios and
administers them until the sale. The company said it was already handling
mortgages totalling Pounds 150m from a well known lender.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Sharp rise in self-employed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of self-employed people in Great Britain rose sharply during the
past 10 years but will probably grow more slowly in future, a Department of
Employment study published yesterday says.
Self-employment rose by 1.1m, or 52 per cent, between 1981 and last year to
3.3m.
The number of people working for themselves also rose in other developed
countries, but nowhere as fast as Britain. Between 1979 and 1989, the
increase was more than three times the average for the European Community.
Although Britain managed to narrow the gap in self-employment numbers with
other countries, it did not close it. The self-employment rate was still
nearly 2 per cent below the EC average in 1989.
Reasons for the rise in self-employment included government policies to help
start such businesses. Many factors were one-off changes that have more or
less worked through, so the pace of future change will be more consistent
with other countries, the study says.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Rail union under pressure at BR
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RMT rail union came under increasing pressure yesterday to accept
wholesale reform of the British Rail bargaining structure after leaders of
the two other rail unions indicated that they were likely to meet BR's July
31 deadline for agreement.
A BR director said he was confident that Aslef, the train drivers' union,
and the TSSA white-collar rail union would agree to the proposals.
He said the RMT remained intransigent but would have to agree or face
derecognition. The government, which is considering a piecemeal sell-off of
BR, might relish a showdown with a union such as the RMT.
Unions and management have been negotiating the new machinery, which will
reflect the market-led restructure of BR, since autumn last year.
British Rail wants to devolve all bargaining to its five businesses and 30
profit centres, apart from some aspects of pay and a few general conditions
of employment. Under the old machinery, individual grievances could be
discussed at national level and might take more than two years to settle.
The unions have been worried about not being able to discuss industrial
action or compensation for changes to duty, for example, at a level they
consider appropriate.
The RMT denied being under greater pressure to agree and said a range of
issues, including health and safety, promotion and transfer and the extent
of devolved bargaining, had not yet been resolved.
Leaders of Aslef are understood to be expecting delegates to their national
conference, which started this week, to back a July 31 settlement. Aslef
believes BR will impose its proposals if unions fail to meet the date.
Delegates at TSSA's annual conference last month voted to trust their
executive committee to achieve the best deal possible, although BR's
proposal for non-binding arbitration remained a drawback.
The RMT says it was always likely to face the greatest difficulties in
agreeing the package because it represents the greatest number and range of
staff.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Trebling in number of water disconnections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of water-supply disconnections nearly trebled in the last
financial year, according to Ofwat, the industry's economic regulator.
Ofwat said the figures, published today, were 'very worrying'. A total of
21,286 homes in England and Wales had their supplies cut off in 1991-92,
compared with 7,673 in the previous year.
The National Consumer Council described the figures as 'horrifying'. It
said: 'As water charges are bound to rise in future, the problem will only
get worse.' The National Association of Citizens' Advice Bureaux demanded
tougher safeguards to protect vulnerable people who could not pay their
bills.
Ofwat gave four possible explanations for the rise: higher bills in a
recession; increased efforts by the companies to recover debts; rising home
repossessions; and direct billing to council tenants.
The figures are certain to fuel criticism of the water companies, which have
been under fire for rising charges, big profits and high salaries for senior
executives.
The surge in disconnections is in contrast to the trends in the electricity
and gas industries. Electricity disconnections in the UK fell from 70,000 in
1989 to 55,000 the following year and to 38,720 last year. About 18,000 gas
customers were disconnected last year, a fall of 1,000 on the previous year.
The fall is due in both cases largely to the introduction of pre-payment
meters.
Top of the water disconnections league was South Staffordshire, which turned
off the tap in 3,494 homes last year. The company also had the highest rate
of disconnections for every 10,000 homes billed, 75.87 - about seven times
the national average.
It said it owed a duty to its paying customers to collect money from those
who would not pay, but help was always available for those with genuine
difficulties. Of the households disconnected, 80 per cent paid and were
reconnected on the same day.
Others with a high rate of disconnections for every 10,000 homes billed
were: Mid Kent (37.05), Cambridge (33.16), and Welsh Water (28.66). Among
those with the lowest rate were Thames (0.21), Wessex (0.94), North Surrey
(0.64), Cholderton and Wrexham (both nil).

FT  05 JUN 92 / Navy targets 1,150 job losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NAVY will seek 1,150 redundancies next year, including 450 officers.
They are in addition to 400 redundancies planned this year.
The measure was announced in a written parliamentary reply by Mr Archie
Hamilton, the armed forces minister. It underlines the difficulties all
three forces are having in achieving their planned reductions in manpower
simply by limiting the inflow of recruits.
Some of the redundancies are expected to be compulsory, as in the first
batch. The navy said it might need a third tranche.
The normal outflow from the armed forces has slowed down, partly because of
a generally adverse job climate and partly because personnel who might have
left are now hoping to benefit from redundancy deals. In the navy's case,
that involves at least 18 months' pay in addition to earned pension rights.
Targets fixed by the government last summer involve reductions of 40,000 in
army personnel, 14,000 in the Royal Air Force and 8,000 in the navy by the
mid 1990s.
The army sent out 3,350 redundancy notices in February and plans two larger
batches next year and the year after.
A limited RAF redundancy programme from 1993 to 1995 was announced last
month, involving 1,150 jobs.
The navy is trying to save its fishery protection squadron from proposals to
hive off that job to the private sector. The proposals, now before a cabinet
committee, are aimed at reducing the annual Pounds 6m paid to the navy by
the Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for patrolling fishing
grounds.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Receivers take control of AWD: Only 22 Bedford trucks made
in first quarter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AWD, the commercial vehicle company created by Yorkshire entrepreneur Mr
David JB Brown from General Motors' loss-making Bedford trucks business six
years ago, went into administrative receivership last night.
The company, based at Dunstable, Bedfordshire, has suffered both from the
collapse of the UK truck market and the lack of large foreign orders.
Nevertheless Mr Tony Thompson, a joint administrative receiver from
accountants KPMG Peat Marwick, said it was intended to sell the company as a
going concern for a sum involving 'tens of millions'.
Many of the company's 650 employees have been laid off for some months. The
company produced only 22 trucks in the first quarter of this year, compared
with 546 in the same period last year and annual production peaks of 6,000
units before the UK truck market started collapsing in 1989.
At its peak, AWD was employing more than 1,300 and Mr Brown boasted of
creating a company employing more than 2,000 people and building 10,000
trucks annually.
Mr Brown bought the business from GM near the end of 1987 for just more than
Pounds 20m. Under GM's ownership, Bedford had been losing Pounds 1/2 m a
week in a plant that had the capacity to produce 60,000 trucks a year and
which, up to the start of the 1980s, had employed 6,000 people.
The AWD receivership does not affect other companies controlled by the Brown
family. They include Artix, the world's largest maker of heavy-duty,
off-road dump trucks at Peterlee, County Durham, which are sold under the
Caterpillar badge.
Mr Thompson said that discussions had already been going on with 'a number'
of potential buyers for the AWD business. In spite of the severely depressed
state of the European truck industry, the receivers are hopeful that AWD's
acknowledged high level of engineering expertise may prove attractive for a
number of potential buyers.
Mr Thompson refused to outline the size of AWD's indebtedness. Its principal
creditors are its bank and a number of as yet unnamed suppliers. The site of
nearly 100 acres is seen as a significant asset - a small portion was sold
recently to J. Sainsbury for Pounds 5m and there remains a lot of land
surplus to the needs of truck-making.
Three months ago, the workforce accepted a 25 per cent pay cut and 10 days'
leave without pay. The biggest recent blow was lack of progress on an
agreement to supply up to 2,000 trucks a year to Iran, claimed by the
company to be worth more than Pounds 70m.

FT  05 JUN 92 / May figures show slow growth in new-car sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW-CAR sales in May rose a weak 1.4 per cent, for the second monthly
year-on-year rise after 29 successive months of falling demand.
The hoped-for resurgence in demand for new vehicles failed to materialise,
with registrations of new commercial vehicles falling 7.7 per cent from the
same month a year ago, according to figures released yesterday by the
Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders.
Demand for new commercial vehicles has fallen year-on-year for 32 months in
succession.
Hopes for a significant recovery in new-car demand were kindled by the 9.1
per cent jump in registrations in April, the first monthly year-on-year
increase in 30 months.
New-car sales of 121,862 in May were marginally higher than a year ago,
however, when sales totalled 120,162.
New-car registrations of 666,179 in the first five months of the year were
still 5.3 per cent lower than in the corresponding period a year ago, and
34.8 per cent lower than in the first five months of 1989.
Ford, the leader of the UK new-car market, suffered a 22.4 per cent fall in
May registrations, which caused its market share to tumble to only 19.6 per
cent from 25.7 per cent in the same month a year ago.
It held on to market leadership because of a surge in sales in the last
three days of the month, with 27.2 per cent of its registrations gained in
the last three days.
Vauxhall, which is narrowing the gap behind Ford, increased its market share
in May to 17.3 per cent from 15.3 per cent a year ago as sales volume rose
14.4 per cent.
Rover, the subsidiary of British Aerospace, increased May sales volume by
14.3 per cent. Its Rover 200/400 series was the second-best selling car in
May behind the Ford Escort/Orion.
Rover still has much ground to make up after a weak start to the year. In
the first five months its sales were 20.9 per cent lower than a year ago.
Mr Bryan Hatter, Saab GB managing director, said a stronger recovery had
started in executive cars, with registrations 5.6 per cent higher than a
year ago.
Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Audi of Germany, and Saab, the Swedish car maker,
achieved a strong growth in sales in May. Rolls-Royce and Bentley sales also
rose for the first time for many months.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Vosper Thornycroft clinches Pounds 200m deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QATAR HAS ordered four high-speed attack vessels from the UK's Vosper
Thornycroft shipyard in a deal estimated by naval experts to be worth about
Pounds 200m.
No details were given about planned armaments, but the 56-metre warships are
designed to carry surface-to-surface missiles. Qatar currently has three
French patrol vessels armed with Exocet missiles.
The order is a breakthrough in a state that was previously regarded as a
captive market for French defence suppliers.
The Southampton-based yard said it would need to start expanding its
workforce next year to cope with a doubling of its order book to some Pounds
700m. The yard is in the midst of a redundancy programme affecting 350 of
its 2,000 employees.
For the first time for a decade, British shipyards have more than 1m gross
tonnes of vessels either under construction or on order, Lloyd's Register
said yesterday. The total is 1,035,512 gross tonnes.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Military spares throw spanner in the works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence found it was buying spanners for Pounds 941 each
when it could obtain them elsewhere for less than one eighth of the price.
By switching to an alternative supplier, it reduced the cost of the spanners
 -for use on heavy-vehicle hub nuts - to Pounds 113.
In another case, army invest-igators queried the price being asked for
forked crowbars - Pounds 84 each. Another manufacturer, brought in to
reverse-engineer the crowbar, made it for Pounds 19.
These cases are among those cited in a report by the National Audit Office,
the public spending watchdog, into the military spares business. The price
difference on the two orders alone amounted to Pounds 268,000.
The report also identified other savings - including Pounds 580,000 a year
saved by buying spares for British Aerospace's Rapier missile system direct
from sub-contractors - but said there was room for improvement.
The MoD spends Pounds 2bn a year on spares and holds more than 2.7m
different items in its inventory. It carried out an extensive study five
years ago to check on suspicions that it was overpaying for spares.
It put potential savings at Pounds 75m a year. Proposals included
diversifying suppliers and purchasing in larger quantities. But the audit
office report found that 'some of the proposals are by no means widely
applied'.
More spares contracts were now being awarded after competition, but the
proportion in value terms was still only 25 per cent in 1990-91. That
compared with a figure of 44 per cent in the overall MoD procurement
programme and 66 per cent for military spares purchases in the US.
The MoD could also take more advantage of quantity discounts. The audit
office found that the total cost of one RAF purchase was greater than if it
had ordered a slightly larger quantity.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Botnar 'renowned for his bullying'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR OCTAV BOTNAR, chairman and managing director of Nissan UK, the former
importer-distributor of Nissan vehicles in Britain, had a reputation for
bullying and 'hiring and firing people', it was alleged in the High Court
yesterday.
Mr Stan Cholaj, a former assistant managing director of Nissan UK, claimed
that in the 2 1/2 years he was employed at the company from late 1986 to
early 1989 'there were over 100 executives on the Pounds 40,000 per annum
category who were hired and fired by Nissan UK'.
Mr Cholaj is seeking damages of more than Pounds 1m from the company for
wrongful dismissal and breach of contract.
Mr Botnar, for whom an arrest warrant was issued by the Inland Revenue in
January, is giving only written evidence to the hearing. He was said by
counsel for his company to be in Switzerland.
In his evidence Mr Cholaj said that Nissan UK strategy discussions were held
each day at lunch. He alleged that Mr Botnar 'used these occasions to
humiliate employees against whom he had taken a dislike. As a result, some
directors were too terrified to attend and ate their lunch in their own
office.'
He claimed that Mr Botnar 'had a reputation at Nissan for being extremely
difficult and rude to management'.
He said that from early 1988 'Mr Botnar's conduct towards me amounted to
more than just the abruptness, arrogance and bullying for which he was
renowned.
'I became aware that Mr Botnar was displaying a hostile attitude to me which
was different from his normal treatment of senior management. I was
increasingly concerned that Mr Botnar was specifically seeking to undermine
me.'
Mr Cholaj alleged that from April 1988 Mr Botnar 'changed my instructions
whenever I was out of the building. He held meetings in subjects where I
would be directly responsible without allowing me to attend. He told
employees 'not to deal with me'. As a result, I would have to ask
subordinates what the decisions had been so that I could implement them.'
Mr Cholaj alleged that Mr Botnar had put his (Mr Cholaj's) name on a memo Mr
Botnar sent in 'intemperate' language to Mr Ian Gibson, then deputy managing
director at Nissan Motor Manufacturing UK, the Japanese carmaker's plant at
Sunderland. 'It was a deliberate ploy to upset relations with Nissan
Manufacturing and I was being used as a tool.'
Mr Cholaj said there were Nissan dealers 'who clearly did not trust Mr
Botnar and claimed that he broke promises made to them, such as DC Cook plc
and J. Martin of Edinburgh'.
He added: 'It was clear from my dealings with Mr Botnar that the
maximisation of sales is the sole basis upon which any individual is
measured (whoever they be) and he is ruthless, both with his employees and
with his dealers in pursuit of those sales.'
The hearing continues today.

THE National Rivers Authority said yesterday that there was an 'underlying

That is in spite of a fall in the number of beaches reaching European
Community standards last year.
The NRA's second annual report on bathing water found that 312 out of 414
beaches, or 75.4 per cent, complied with EC standards. That was down from
78.1 per cent in 1990 .

THE DEPARTMENT of Trade and Industry launched an initiative yesterday to
encourage students to study for higher science degrees through industrial
partnerships, Daniel Green writes.
The department has allocated Pounds 2m a year to the five schemes. They will
take on 100 students by the start of the 1993-94 academic year.
The partnerships are a pilot for Faraday Centres, promised by ministers
before the general election and recommended in last month's final report of
the Prince of Wales's Working Group on Innovation. The scheme, managed by
the DTI and the Science and Engineering Research Council, will lead to
conventional MScs and PhDs in a wide range of industrial disciplines.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Tokyo expects 3.5% annual growth rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government expects the economy to grow at an average rate of
3.5 per cent annually over the next five years, according to drafts of a
long-term economic plan to be published this month.
The plan, prepared by the government's Economic Planning Agency, envisages
growth being led by domestic demand, including public and private spending
designed to improve the standard of living in Japan.
The expected contribution from domestic demand will be set at 3.75 per cent;
the net contribution from external demand will be negative.
This means that import growth will exceed export growth and that Japan's
trade surplus, bugbear of its relations with the US and Europe, will shrink.
Even though the plan has been drawn up in the middle of a sharp slowdown in
the Japanese economy, its conclusions are generally up-beat. It assumes that
Japan will pull out of the current downturn towards the end of the year.
The government is sticking to a forecast of 3.5 per cent growth for the
current financial year, which started in April, even though the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development expects to see a far slower rate
of growth.
The government was watching the effects of a package of economy-boosting
measures, announced two months ago.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Indian police raid broker's properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE in Bombay raided yesterday more than 34 homes and offices belonging
to the broker at the centre of the securities scandal and to his family.
Mr Harshad Mehta was also named in the first criminal indictment filed over
the affair, along with 12 others. These included his wife Jyoti and brothers
Ashwin and Sudhi, with senior officials of the State Bank of India, the
country's largest commercial bank.
Mr Mehta was taken away for interrogation, and was later formally arrested,
according to Reuters news agency.
The indictment had been filed by the Central Bureau of Investigation at a
special court hearing in New Delhi last Friday, but not previously
publicised. It alleges criminal conspiracy and breach of trust, cheating,
forgery, falsification of accounts and bribery.
Among those named was Mr C L Khemani, the State Bank deputy managing
director in charge of treasury operations. The bank's chairman was told to
go on leave on Wednesday, pending his retirement at the end of next month.
Assets belonging to Mr Harshad Mehta, his family and companies had been
frozen by the CBI, which is investigating how Rs30.8bn (Pounds 600m) was
illicitly taken out of the banking system.
The CBI's action so far relates to only one part of the affair - dealings
between Mr Mehta and the State Bank, which channelled Rs170bn of
transactions through him in the inter-bank markets since last July.
Some Rs4bn belonging to the National Housing Bank was later used to pay off
part of Mr Mehta's debts to the State Bank, after the money had been routed
through the broker's current account at ANZ Grindlays.
NHB cheques were paid by Grindlays into Mr Mehta's account, even though they
were made out to the bank itself and carried no instructions to pay Mr
Mehta.
Grindlays has claimed this was normal market practice between banks and
brokers. A broker may have a cheque credited to his account the day it is
received only when the cheque is made out in a bank's name and drawn on the
Reserve Bank of India, the country's central bank.
The affair has pitched Grindlays into head-on confrontation with the Reserve
Bank. It owns NHB, and is trying to press Grindlays into setting up a
provision to reflect its liability to refund the money.
The CBI's attention is expected to spread to other aspects of the affair.
These include the way in which Standard Chartered and two subsidiaries of
the state-owned Canara Bank came to be owed Rs12.8bn between them by Bank of
Karad and Metropolitan Co-Operative Bank, both of which lack sufficient
assets to repay the money.

FT  05 JUN 92 / China threatens construction schedule for new HK airport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHINA'S delay in approving financing plans for Hong Kong's new airport is
causing concern among managers of the HKDollars 120bn (Pounds 8.5bn) project
about slippage of the tight construction schedule.
Under the memorandum of understanding signed last September by Mr John
Major, the UK prime minister, and Li Peng, his Chinese counterpart, China
agreed to take only one month in consultations to approve the airport's
financing plans.
The Hong Kong government gave China detailed plans in early April, but has
so far received no final response as informal consultations continue. The
airport and its associated roads, railway and bridge are due to open before
June 1997, when sovereignty over Hong Kong reverts from London to Beijing.
If agreement is not reached, the subject could be discussed by Mr Major and
Li when they meet next week at the earth summit in Rio de Janeiro. The delay
may cast doubt on what was achieved by the memorandum of understanding,
under which China won considerable involvement in the project - as well as a
visit to Beijing by Mr Major to sign the deal - in return for agreeing to
the airport's going ahead.
Hong Kong government officials dismiss concerns about the construction
timetable, saying that no work is being held up by the delay. But Hong Kong
needs China's blessing in order to bring the financing plans before the
local legislature, which ends its session on July 16.
'If we slip beyond that date it could cause significant delays to the
project,' said one senior official. 'The Chinese understand that.'
One official said the Chinese were worried about the extent of contingent
liabilities which would be inherited by Hong Kong's post-1997 government,
particularly HKDollars 12.5bn in 'callable equity' - financing which the
government would provide, but only if necessary.
Hong Kong's negotiators have indicated their desire to settle the matter but
do not believe the Chinese have come completely clean on all their concerns.
Some believe the Chinese were upset by Mr Major's positive reception in
London of Mr Martin Lee, leader of the opposition United Democrats party in
Hong Kong.
Others, however, believe that Chinese civil servants prefer to push tough
decisions up to a higher level.
'Decisions are dangerous if you live in that system,' says one observer.
'They understand the need to resolve it but understanding and meeting it are
two different things. It is better if you can get your superior to take the
decision.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S ruling Liberal Democratic Party early today pushed a controversial
bill through a parliamentary committee allowing the despatch of Japanese
troops overseas as United Nations peacekeepers, agencies report from Tokyo.
The bill was passed by the upper house committee after a chaotic 16-hour
session, despite shouting and sign-waving by members of the opposition
Socialist Party. The Socialists vowed to continue the fight when the bill
goes to a vote in a plenary session of the upper house later today.
An earlier version of the bill was passed by the lower house of parliament
late last year amid similar turmoil. The ruling party, which lacks a
majority in the upper house, then agreed to amend the bill as part of a pact
with two small centrist parties in order to get the bill through the upper
house.
As a result, the bill must eventually go back to the lower house for
re-approval, which could take a week.
The bill is designed to allow Japan to send a 2,000-member army unit to take
part in UN peacekeeping missions such as the one in Cambodia. But the
Socialists say the bill violates Japan's post-1945 constitution, which bans
military force to solve international disputes.
They have vowed to stage an 'ox-walk' in the upper house, a form of
fillibuster where members take about 30 minutes each to complete a single
vote.
The Socialists staged protests as the long committee hearing was brought to
a halt with the vote early today. Deputies shouted 'go home' at police
swarming into the committee room.

REPUBLICAN presidential contender Patrick Buchanan will undergo heart
surgery today to replace an aortic valve, his campaign said yesterday,
Reuter reports from Washington.
Doctors expected him to recover fully in about seven weeks. The surgery will
be performed at the Washington Hospital Centre.
Mr Buchanan, 53, a conservative television commentator and newspaper
columnist, challenged President George Bush strongly in New Hampshire and
other early primaries this year, in some cases winning more than 30 per cent
of the vote.
But his challenge has faded in later contests and Mr Bush easily beat him on
Tuesday in the Californian Republican primary.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Bush gets a second wind for Americas: Washington's injection
of new life into its hemisphere initiative
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Mr Nicholas Brady, the US treasury secretary, sits down with Latin
American finance ministers in Washington later this month, one of his tasks
will be to inject new life into a US initiative which some see as flagging.
The Enterprise for the Americas Initiative (EAI) was launched nearly two
years ago by President George Bush as the first comprehensive US policy for
Latin America since President Kennedy's Alliance for Progress more than 30
years ago.
It placed economic partnership at the centre of post-Cold War relations
between the US and Latin American democracies. It stressed regional trade
liberalisation - opening up the possibility of a free trade zone from Alaska
to Antarctica - reform of investment regimes and official debt relief.
Former secretary of state Mr Henry Kissinger called it the most creative
international policy measure undertaken by the Bush administration. Mr John
Sewell, president of the Overseas Development Council, a study group based
in Washington, described the EAI as the first 'post-aid development policy'.
Carrying none of the paternalism of previous US policies towards the region,
the EAI was applauded by almost every Latin American leader. Although there
were some worries that the US was replacing an insistence on anti-communism
with an insistence on neo-liberalism as the basis of policy, it succeeded in
addressing current concerns of Latin American governments without proposing
resource transfers to the region that the US could ill afford.
The launch of the initiative came two weeks after the president's
announcement of his intention to seek a free trade agreement with Mexico and
appeared to signal a new-found US interest in the region beyond the usual
concerns about drugs and immigration.
The prospect for a partnership was reinforced by the willingness of the Bush
administration to work through the Organisation of American States, an
organisation it ignored throughout the 1980s. The culmination of this was
the June 1991 Santiago declaration which committed member governments to
help defend democracy in the region.
Since then, however, some of the good feelings have dissipated. The OAS
proved helpless to reverse a military coup in Haiti, was stunned by an
attempted coup in Venezuela and divided over how to deal with President
Alberto Fujimori's dissolution of Peru's Congress in April.
Meanwhile, the EAI also showed signs of losing momentum. According to Mr
Mark Falcoff, of the American Enterprise Institute, the new policy had
'fallen from the screen'. Mr Viron Vakey of the Carnegie Endowmentsaid he
was 'becoming more and more pessimistic about the policy'.
Each of the three parts of the initiative suffered delays:
Trade: By October 1991, the US had signed bilateral framework agreements -
the first step to a free trade accord - with all Latin American countries
except the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Surinam and Cuba. But negotiation of
free-trade agreements with other countries has had to await the completion
of talks with Mexico and Canada over the North American Free Trade
Agreement, which have been going more slowly than expected. Chile will be
next in line.
Investment: Two new programmes were set up with the aim of encouraging
reform of economic policies and investment regulation. The first was an
Inter-American Development Bank programme to support investment
liberalisation and privatisation, from which countries such as Colombia have
already benefited.
The IADB was also to administer a Dollars 1.5bn Multilateral Investment Fund
to which the US, Japan and the EC would each contribute Dollars 100m each a
year for five years. Some EC countries, including Britain, declined to
contribute, with part of the shortfall being made up by Latin governments.
However, in April, the US Congress refused to vote US funding, which meant
matching funds from Japan would be unavailable.
Foreign debt: Covering Dollars 12bn in bilateral debt owed by Latin
countries to the US, it allowed for interest payments to be paid in local
currency for an environmental fund and the cancellation of certain loans
through debt-for-equity or debt-for-nature swaps.
Although only a modest benefit overall - the savings if fully implemented
would amount to Dollars 400m a year - this was potentially important for
some countries, such as Jamaica, with heavy government-to-government debt.
Some debt has already been reduced, but the vast majority was also held up
in April by Congress.
These delays have contributed to a sense of frustration among Latin
governments and a concern that US interest in the region will prove as
transitory as it has in the past.
Mr David Mulford, US treasury under-secretary for international affairs,
disagrees with this view. Admitting congressional delays were a setback, he
said this week that the Bush administration remained strongly committed to
the initiative, and would press for passage of the relevant legislation in
the current fiscal year. Latin America, he pointed out, was the fastest
growing foreign market for the US. 'A strong Latin America is good for the
US economy,' he said.
Those invited to Washington on June 24-25 are finance ministers from a dozen
governments which have benefited either from Mr Brady's bank debt reduction
initiative or the EAI, or those expected to benefit in the near future, such
as El Salvador and Brazil. Mr Enrique Iglesias, president of the IADB, will
also attend. Mr Mulford said the meeting would provide the opportunity for
consultation before the summit of the Group of Seven in Munich early next
month.
While this should help to promote the idea of a hemisphere partnership,
finance ministers will also be interested to hear how the US proposes to
advance the Enterprise initiative. Interested and probably - given the
narrow preoccupations of Congress and Mr Bush's own concerns - sceptical.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Brazil seeks to end impasse on diversity accord

<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S President Fernando Collor is today expected to suggest in a speech
at the Earth Summit modifications on a crucial treaty on bio-diversity that
it hopes will allow the US to sign it and thus reduce north-south divisions.
The US has caused widespread consternation and anger at the summit by saying
outright that it would not sign the accord, which deals with survival of
species.
So far there is little evidence that Mr Collor's initiative will do more
than fall on stony ground. Early this morning Mr George Bush angrily
rejected criticism of the US refusal to sign.
'I will not sign a treaty which in my view throws too many Americans out of
work,' he said.
'I have some responsibility: responsibility for a cleaner environment and
responsibility for families who want to work. . . If they don't understand
it in Rio, too bad.'
The Brazilian initiative comes just after France announced it would sign the
treaty, putting further pressure on the other two waverers, Britain and
Japan. Mrs Segolene Royal, French environment minister, said last night
France 'wanted to be a leader' and would sign all the summit's conventions.
Last night Mr Jose Goldemberg, Brazilian environment minister told Mr
William Reilly, head of the US Environmental Protection Agency, that Mr
Collor's speech would incorporate some 'suggestions' to meet US concerns.
The new effort to get the US on board came after the leaking of a memo from
Mr Reilly to the White House in which he proposed that the US suggest
modifications in the text in order to avoid being cast as a villain at the
summit.
Mr Reilly said last night the White House had rejected his suggestions and
added 'we completely rule out signing the bio-diversity treaty in its
present form. Many other countries share our view but for their own reasons
do not wish to state this publicly.'
Mr Reilly said the White House held serious doubts about the intellectual
property issues raised by the bio-diversity treaty such as the possible
patenting of genetic material.
Mr Goldemberg appeared to share some of his doubts on the treaty, asking:
'What I don't understand is why people agreed to it in Nairobi (where the
last meeting was held)'.
Japan is expected to announce next week that it will sign the bio-diversity
convention, and in London yesterday the UK government said it hoped and
expected to sign.
Britain had initialled the convention, but then had second thoughts because
of concerns that it implied an open-ended financial commitment from the
developed world.
Japan, too, shares this worry that the treaty amounts to a 'blank cheque on
aid'. Britain is seeking to ensure adequate arrangements to monitor
protection of species.
France was keen for the global community to draw up lists of the world's
species. This, however, was rejected by countries, which feared it would
encourage excessive conservation.

FT  05 JUN 92 / President backs curb on budgets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush last night sought to revitalise his re-election
campaign by throwing his weight behind efforts to amend the US constitution
to require balanced budgets.
Mr Bush said the US political system had failed to meet its responsibility
to deal with the country's soaring fiscal deficits, and a constitutional
amendment was now needed.
'We've tried compromise, we've tried confrontation, we've tried quiet
diplomacy. . . tonight I'm more than ever convinced that a balanced budget
amendment is the only way,' he said in an evening press conference.
But Senator George Mitchell, leader of the Democratic opposition in the
Senate, sneered that Mr Bush's support for a balanced budget amendment was
'another example of him saying one thing and doing another.' Senator
Mitchell said: 'By submitting budgets with record deficits and then somehow
suggesting it's all someone else's fault, that's a familiar pattern in this
administration.'
The federal budget deficit is expected to reach Dollars 400bn (Pounds 219bn)
this year.
Supporters of a balanced budget amendment, which would have to be passed by
two-thirds of both the House of Representatives and Senate and then be
ratified by three-quarters of the states, were until recently confident of
winning a vote this year.
Although the amendment is expected to pass the House when it comes up for a
vote next week, opposition is now growing in the Senate.
Mr Bush added he had signed last night a bill cutting Dollars 8bn of
spending previously approved, although the cuts were significantly altered
by Congress from the list of rescissions he had originally submitted. The
cuts mainly involved an early end to Seawolf submarine construction.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Changes in forestry may curb US logging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Forest Service is to change its forest management philosophy in a
move that could sharply alter logging practices and help to revive
indigenous tree species almost wiped out by rapidly-growing softwoods.
Mr Dale Robertson, service chief, has instructed regional foresters to start
to manage the 191m acres of national forest under their authority as
'dynamic and complex eco-systems,' instead of concentrating on maximising
timber production.
The new policy is to lead to a 70 per cent reduction in clear-cutting, where
loggers clear an entire area of trees and brush, and to a greater use of
less intensive logging techniques that leave some trees standing.
At the moment, clear-cutting is used on about a third of the 800,000 to
900,000 acres harvested each year in national forests, and accounts for a
much higher proportion of timber volume.
The Forestry Service also aims to restore traditional North American tree
species, including east coast hardwoods and the western ponderosa pine,
which has been largely superseded by faster-growing species such as Douglas
fir and lodgepole pine.
Forestry officials said reduction of clear-cutting would lead to a
short-term drop of about 10 per cent in timber volume harvested, but added
that volumes would return to their previous levels over time.
Stable volumes would imply logging on larger acreages. Some foresters argue
there is ample scope for thinning existing forests.
The exact consequences of the new eco-system in forest management policy are
difficult to predict, especially as it is by no means clear that Mr
Robertson will be allowed to proceed with his policy change by President
George Bush.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIVE attempts to cut federal funding for non-commercial radio and TV
in the US have been defeated in the Senate. On Wednesday night, the Senate
passed, by 84-11, a Dollars 1.1bn (Pounds 610m) three-year authorisation for
the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, having earlier rejected by 75-22 a
proposal to freeze funding at present levels.
As a concession to conservatives, the bill stipulates that 'indecent
programming' should in most cases only be broadcast after midnight.
The argument this time was that it was wrong to subsidise programmes for the
US elite while the general watchword was budgetary austerity. Senator Trent
Lott (Republican, Mississippi), charged that the funding bill 'clearly
amounts, for the most part, to an upper-middle-class entitlement programme.'
The standard fare on non-commercial TV runs heavily to British imported
drama, interspersed with current affairs, political talk shows, and arguably
the best nightly news show: the MacNeil-Lehrer Report.
Few non-commercial stations make their own programmes, many surviving on
federal funds and subscription drives. Even supporters of public
broadcasting concede the system is not cost-effective. But public
broadcasting has strong backing in Washington.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Nato agrees Europe peacekeeping role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT MAUTHNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   OSLO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATO foreign ministers yesterday agreed that the alliance should take on a
new peacekeeping role in Europe, though there is no immediate prospect of it
deploying troops in areas of conflict such as Yugoslavia while a durable
ceasefire is not in place.
A statement issued by Nato foreign ministers said the 16 allies were
prepared to support peacekeeping activities 'on a case-by-case basis' on the
specific request of the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe.
It is the first time that Nato, which was founded in 1949, has agreed to
take action involving the defence of non-members.
Mr Manfred Worner, the secretary-general, said the peacekeeping offer
covered not only transport, other infrastructure facilities and supplies of
military equipment, but also troops, if necessary.
However, the statement was carefully worded to allow individual member
states to opt out of any peacekeeping mission - to take account of mainly
French objections. France is opposed to giving Nato an enhanced role and
argues that requests for peacekeeping help should be addressed to individual
member states rather than to the organisation - as proposed by the US,
Britain and Germany. The compromise finally reached can be interpreted as
being either an offer from Nato or the member states.
Mr Lawrence Eagleburger, the US deputy secretary of state, expressed his
country's strong support for the decision to make Nato's capabilities and
assets available for CSCE-mandated peacekeeping operations. The CSCE, he
said, had 'a unique role to play as a flexible political instrument for
managing democratic change and addressing the root causes of conflict'.
However, both Mr Eagleburger and Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign
secretary, stressed that the CSCE should also be able to turn to
international organisations, such as the United Nations and the nine-nation
Western European Union.
In a separate statement, the ministers called for an immediate ceasefire in
Nagorno-Karabakh, the Armenian enclave in Azerbaijan.
In a strongly-worded statement, Nato foreign ministers yesterday condemned
the use of force in the territory of the former Yugoslavia. They also
expressed their 'strongest support' for the UN resolution imposing sanctions
on Serbia and Montenegro.
Meanwhile, the opposition Serbian Renewal Party, led by Mr Vuk Draskovic,
and the Democratic Party led by Dragojlub Micunovic, demanded the immediate
resignation of Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic. In a surprise
development, the Serbian Academy of Sciences and the University of Belgrade,
long regarded as the bastion of Mr Milosevic's support, yesterday also
started a debate, and eventual vote, about the Serbian leader's future.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Divided feelings about Russia split former USSR into two
camps: Deepening mutual distrust is evolving where once there were hopes of
a loose commonwealth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE post-Soviet states are not evolving towards the loose confederation they
envisaged when they founded the Commonwealth of Independent States six
months ago: instead, they are developing ever deeper mutual hostilities,
within whose framework two alliances are beginning to form  - one pro- and
one anti-Russian.
This is accompanied by an increasing assertiveness on the part of Russian
leaders, including those who came to power on democratic, anti-totalitarian
programmes. Says Mr Sergei Stankevich, a state adviser to Mr Boris Yeltsin,
the Russian president: 'It is important for Russia to defend the legal and
other rights of Russians outside of Russia. If it doesn't, it will seriously
weaken the stature of the Russian president.'
For political leaders in Ukraine, Moldova, Azerbaijan and the three Baltic
states - now emerging as a loose, potentially anti-Russian alliance -
political leaders fear that the old empire is striking back. Ukraine, the
largest of these, is the decisive force in such an alliance - and the
judgment of Mr Mykola Mykhalchenko, political adviser to Mr Leonid Kravchuk,
the Ukrainian president, is widely shared: 'Russia wishes to become the
successor of the old Russian empire. It has an economic crisis and its
leaders are trying to rally the country around nationalist-patriotic ideas.'
Ukrainian leaders and parliamentarians, alarmed by the decision of the
Russian parliament to declare illegal the 1954 transfer of the Crimea from
Russian to Ukrainian jurisdiction, think it is not an isolated action: Mr
Mykhalchenko believes that Russia will make claims for border regions in
Estonia and Kazakhstan as well as eastern Ukraine and Crimea, where there
are areas of majority Russian populations.
The Baltic states are more concerned with continued stationing of Russian
troops on their territories. General Pavel Grachev, the Russian defence
minister, has said that troops will not be pulled out until 1999 - a
timetable all the Baltic states have rejected. Estonia yesterday announced
it was breaking off all talks with Russia on the issue.
Mr Stankevich is indignant over Baltic claims that Russia is behaving like
an imperialist power, especially since, in his and many Russians' view,
legislation on citizenship and language introduced in these states
discriminates against the Russians, who make up some 40 per cent of the
Latvian population and more than 30 per cent in Estonia.
'The independence of the Baltic states was the cause of the Russian
democrats: we cannot be blamed for the imperialist past. But now we are
blamed for the troops being there. Meanwhile, our complaints about the abuse
of human rights of Russians are ignored.'
Moldova is the most alienated of the former Soviet states: its parliament
has gone so far as to consider a declaration of war on Russia. Its militia
is engaged with the forces of the separatist Russian population of the
TransDnestr region, and it suspects that the Russian 14th army is heavily
engaged on the side of the separatists.
Though Ukrainians are as numerous as Russians in the TransDnestr area, they
have tended to stay out of the fighting - and Moldova is careful to
distinguish between them. Moldovan foreign minister Nikolai Tiu visited Kiev
yesterday after talks with Russian ministers - where he stressed that his
government appreciated the neutral stance taken by Ukraine and that distrust
for Russia remained high.
Says Mr Nikon Paslaru, spokesman for the Moldovan presidency: 'The
pro-imperialist tendency has become more evident. Earlier, Russian diplomats
had to take into account the views of other republics. Now, when it has
become clear that the CIS will end, Russia takes off the mask and spits on
everyone else.'
Not on everyone. Russia has a sphere of influence which it is increasingly
defining: it includes the central Asian states, especially Kazakhstan,
Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, with which it has signed treaties of close
co-operation and which, with Armenia, are mostly within the treaty of
collective security, signed last month in Tashkent.
Both Mr Nursultan Nazarbayev, the Kazakh president and Mr Islam Karimov, the
Uzbek president, have made an alliance with Russia the cornerstone of their
policy: Mr Karimov even told the newspaper Pravda that 'Uzbekistan sees no
future for itself without friendship with Russia' - a strong echo of the
flatulent protestations of Soviet The sphere includes Armenia - since that
small, poor republic has discovered that it remains surrounded by Moslem
states at least potentially hostile to it, and needs Russia's support once
more. The 7th Russian Army is likely to stay in place, and Russian support
courted. By contrast, Azerbaijan - with which Armenia is in a state of
undeclared war over the enclave of Nagorno Karabakh - inclines towards
Moldova and Ukraine, from the latter of which have come many officers to act
as technical advisers to the developing Azeri army.
The other states - Belarus, Georgia, Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan - are in
different ways seeking to differentiate themselves from Russia without
provoking it. All, especially Belarus, acknowledge their huge economic
dependence: but they have stayed out of a close, security arrangement.
Georgia has stayed out of the CIS.
On some accounts, the area of legitimate Russian intervention is any former
Soviet state, whether 'friendly' or not. General Grachev earlier this week
said Russia had the right to intervene in any neighbouring state when it
felt there was a danger of foreign interference - a doctrine which could be
used to legitimate a hostile intervention as much as a friendly one.
It is too early to say these two emerging blocs are hostile, and it is
evident that they had contradictory as well as common interests. But on one
side, there is a feeling of the flexing of Russian muscles: on Russia's
side, there is resentment at the imputation of imperialism, yet Russia
insists on a great power status and the definition of a sphere of influence.

<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government has reached a last-minute deal on reform of the
Bundesbank in a bid to ensure that the country's 16 federal Lander (states)
do not gain excessive control over the central bank.
However the plans, which would reduce the representation of the states on
the bank's governing council from 11 to nine, may remain in the balance
because of constitutional challenges.
The plan will be put to the vote today in the Bundesrat, the upper house of
the German parliament, in which the 16 states are represented. There it will
probably be rejected by a majority of the states, ruled by opposition Social
Democrats.
But the compromise should ensure the reform eventually becomes law: there
will not be a two-thirds majority against it. This means the Bundesrat
decision can be overturned by a simple majority in the directly-elected
Bundestag, the lower house, which the government controls.
The key change was an agreement that a new joint state bank will be formed
by Saxony and Thuringia, both part of the former East Germany, instead of
combining Thuringia with Hesse in the west, as originally planned. In all,
the state banks will combine to form nine new banks, instead of the present
11, and instead of an automatic increase to 16 to take in the new eastern
states.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission has given up trying to persuade satellite operators,
equipment manufacturers and broadcasters to sign a single document legally
binding them to promote high-definition television (HDTV).
The Commission has decided to change direction, by asking the industry
groups to agree to a watered-down 'declaration of intent'. Companies will
have to conclude bilateral contracts with the Commission, laying out their
individual strat-egies, so as to benefit from its proposed Ecu850m (Pounds
593m) plan to encourage wide-screen television services in the EC.
Even so, the move is still likely to raise fears that the Commission is
intent on trying to dictate HDTV strategy to industry. This was the flaw
that crippled its original advanced television policy in the mid-1980s.
When it launched the HDTV action plan in April, the Commission proposed a
legally binding 'memorandum of understanding' as one of 'three integral
pillars' of its strategy, along with the plan itself and the directive on EC
satellite television transmission standards, agreed before Christmas.
Wide-screen television - a first step towards full HDTV - is unlikely to
become a reality unless industry co-operates to produce suitable programmes
and equipment.
Officials said yesterday that the Commission's action plan, rather than the
memorandum, would now provide the backbone of the policy. They stressed that
the plan had emerged from discussions with industry.
EC telecommunications ministers will discuss the five-year plan for the
first time in Luxembourg today. They will reach no formal agreement because
the European Parliament has yet to give its opinion on the proposal and
because the controversial funding element depends on approval of the EC
budget for 1993-97.
The commission may still have trouble getting industry to sign up before the
terms and financing of the action plan are agreed.
Industry representatives were to meet in Brussels on Wednesday to discuss
the situation, but delayed the meeting until June 15 to assess the reaction
of EC members to the Commission's proposal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SARAJEVO, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina has suffered constant bombing
since the international recognition, last April, of the former Yugoslav
republic's independence - with results such as those pictured above.
However, the siege of the capital by Serb militia groups, which today enters
its third month, sees many in the city close to dying of starvation, writes
Judy Dempsey from Belgrade.
Dr Farhuk Konjhovzic, a 55-year-old neurosurgeon at the city's general
hospital, says his surgical unit is short of everything.
'We are running out of antibiotics, penicillin, and basic medical equipment.
We are just about coping. I look after 40 patients. All of them have very
serious head injuries caused by explosives. We just have to keep working,
day and night.'
Outside, no one dares linger in the streets. Public transport is at a
standstill. The constant bombing of the city has made sure of that.
'It's eerie out there,' said Mr Misrad Becerovic, a journalist at Sarajevo
radio. 'I now sleep here at the radio station. When you go out and you see
that it is quiet, you think you are safe. Then, from nowhere, the snipers
shoot. No one is safe.'
Everyone is hungry. Mr Konjhovzic says he cannot remember the taste of fruit
or fresh vegetables. 'We are living off rice and bread. No one is receiving
any protein whatsoever. There is no milk for the children, no nourishment
for the elderly.'
In the neighbouring suburb of Dobrinja, the people yesterday started to eat
pigeons. The district has been completely surrounded by the Serb militia.
Not a crumb trickles through the blockade. Mr Konjhovzic says the people,
who have been without food or water for 25 days, are close to dying from
starvation.
Yesterday, the UN again tried to continue negotiations with Croat, Moslem
and Serb forces, with the aim to reopen Sarajevo airport. Like the city, it
is entering the third month of a Serbian-enforced blockade.
Elsewhere, Serb forces yesterday tried to gain control of the city of

FT  05 JUN 92 / Moscow turmoil over ministers' views on reform

<TEXT>
THE RUSSIAN government yesterday appeared in the grip of internal turmoil
because of the appointment of three ministers with different perspectives
and attitudes to those of free-marketers who have been commanding
centre-stage.
Statements by Mr Vladimir Shumeiko, former deputy speaker of the parliament
and now joint first deputy prime minister with Mr Yegor Gaidar, indicate
that he wants a more state-orientated strategy on privatisation and an
immediate halving of the 28 per cent value added tax (VAT).
Mr Alexei Ulyukayev, the government's economic adviser, said yesterday that
neither was government policy. But he refused to say whether Mr Shumeiko or
Mr Gaidar was senior first deputy: Mr Gaidar remained in control of economic
strategy and of the country's finances, while Mr Shumeiko was in 'operative
control' of government policy.
Mr Ulyukayev indicated that the government's first phase of radical reform
was concluded. He said 'realities call for different tactics' and 'you can
be a strict economic liberal, good at solving problems of the first period
of reform, on the macroeconomic level, but the question of combining
macroeconomic and microeconomic issues has not been solved ..the next stage
allows you to make certain changes in course.'
Professor Yevgenny Yasin, the government's plenipotentiary to parliament who
is engaged in drafting medium-term strategy, said there was a danger of
emergence of 'two centres of power' around the two first deputy premiers.
Meanwhile, confusion deepened yesterday when parliament refused to accept
the resignation of Mr Georgy Matiukhin, Central Bank chairman.
Mr Shumeiko told parliament that Mr Matiukhin could not be directly blamed
for all the failures of the bank and that, with only a year in office, he
had not served long enough.
Mr Matiukhin himself appeared and proposed a freeze on wages and prices as
an alternative to the 80 per cent interest rates for which he has been much
criticised.
Mr Vassily Barchuk, finance minister, said he thought interest rates were
too high even though government policy is to defend present levels.
Parliament refused to countenance such a freeze, refused to agree to Mr
Shumeiko's suggestion that Mr Matiukhin be appointed for a five-year term
with security of tenure - a condition Mr Matiukhin said was indispensable to
his doing his job - and also refused to allow him to quit.
Mr Ulyukayev said the government changes in personnel and tactics would have
to be 'explained' to the IMF, with which it is negotiating access to the
Dollars 24bn (Pounds 13.3bn) credits put up by the fund and the major
foreign governments.

<TEXT>
POLAND'S politicians last night prepared to re-open their perennial search
for stable government, after the fall of the centre-right cabinet headed by
Mr Jan Olszewski who had been in power for just six months.
The government, the third in the three years since the demise of communism,
fell after a motion for its dismissal was put to parliament yesterday by
President Lech Walesa and was carried by 273 votes to 119 with 33
abstentions.
The vote came after a tense day in parliament as rumours spread about the
contents of a list of some 60 former secret police informers delivered to
leaders of parliamentary commissions and political parties.
The list, which was not made public, contains the names of around one tenth
of those vetted. The list of deputies, members of the government and the
President's office came after a vote last week in parliament demanding that
such names be revealed.
Mr Olszewski implied in a short speech on television last night that the
sudden motion by Mr Walesa to dismiss the government had been provoked by
the fact that the lists had been delivered to parliament. Parliament had
been due to vote on a no-confidence motion against the government todasy,
but the vote was brought forward under pressure from Mr Walesa.
Mr Olszewski said: 'An independent country cannot be ruled by people who are
enslaved by their own past,' referring to the former agents who now hold
public office.
Later he told parliament that he thought that 'the issue of who Poland
belonged to had still not been resolved', referring to the continuing
influence of former communist officials.
The government lost last night's vote because it failed to secure the
support of the populist KPN party and lost the backing of the PSL farmers'
group. The PSL leader, the 32-year-old Mr Waldemar Pawlak is expected to be
nominated by President Walesa as the next prime minister.
Mr Walesa evidently hopes that Mr Pawlak will be able to construct a
majority coalition bringing in the free market reform parties which opposed
Mr Olszewski's government from its inception.
It seems clear that Mr Walesa will play a dominant role in the new
government.
Yesterday Mr Walesa looked determined and angry as he observed debate,
during which a deputy, Mr Kazmierz Switon, accused him of having been a
police agent.
Earlier in the day Mr Walesa issued a statement in which he implictly
admitted that he had signed a document promising to work with the
authorities in 1970 which he later withdrew.
He said, however, that he had never betrayed colleagues or his ideals.
Mr Walesa attacked the disclosures, saying they could 'completely
destabilise state and party political structures'.
He alleged that the interior ministry's files 'were to a large extent
false', and implied that some of the documents were fabricated by the secret
services of other countries.
He also sought to forestall charges of collaboration. 'I have been arrested
many times. The first time was in December 1970 when I signed three or four
documents . . . I never betrayed my ideals or my colleagues,' he said.

<TEXT>
WEST GERMAN economic growth gained a welcome lift in the first quarter of
this year from mild winter weather, strong output in the building sector and
1.5 extra working days.
Gross national product was 1.8 per cent higher than in the first three
months of 1991, the federal statistics office reported yesterday. That
growth followed a rise of only 0.6 per cent in the last quarter of 1991, the
lowest increase since the spring of 1987.
Despite further comforting news on the employment front - jobless totals
fell slightly in both parts of the country - industry remains gloomy about
the immediate future.
Business conditions worsened in the west during April, the Ifo economics
institute reported yesterday, and expectations for the next six months
remained pessimistic. According to its monthly business confidence survey,
there were still no signs of improved export business. However, in the east
the rate of job losses had slowed and conditions appeared to have
stabilised, Ifo said.
The value of incoming orders to east German companies contracted by 30 per
cent in February. Foreign orders were down 55 per cent.
The statistics office said spending on construction was 10 per cent up on
the previous year.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: D-Mark gathers strength from
financial market nervousness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, SARA WEBB and TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALM RETURNED to Europe's financial markets yesterday as investors digested
the implications of Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty in
Tuesday's referendum.
The D-Mark continued to benefit from nervousness that other European
countries might renege on the financial disciplines of monetary convergence,
while sterling and the Italian lira slipped closer to the bottom of the
European monetary system grid.
To defend the lira, the Bank of Italy was compelled to raise by a quarter
point to 13 per cent the rate at which it gives emergency funding to credit
institutions. But its discount rate was unchanged at 12 per cent.
In the European government bond market high-yielding securities, including
stocks issued by the Italian and Spanish governments, continued to tumble as
the Japanese joined Europeans investors in the rush to sell.
However, as some dealers took advantage of cheaper prices, some government
bonds ended the day off their lows. German bonds remained the main
beneficiary.
Ecu bonds, dogged by fears about their future in the wake of the uncertainty
about monetary union, bore the brunt of the selling pressure. French bonds
and UK gilt-edged securities held their ground.
'The worst is probably over now. We've seen the shake-out and we should see
some recovery now, barring no other disastrous news,' said a trader from a
US bank.
Although the D-Mark continued to edge higher against other European
currencies, it was with less momentum than on Wednesday.
After a two pfennig decline on Wednesday, sterling gained a quarter of a
pfennig, closing in London at DM2.9175. Against the D-Mark the Italian lira
closed down, at L756.6, compared with Wednesday's close of L756.1.
The Dutch guilder and the Belgian franc remained steady alongside Germany's
currency.
Mr Steve Hannah, head of research at IBJ International, the securities arm
of Industrial Bank of Japan, said the quieter markets stemmed partly from a
better understanding among investors of what the Danes were voting against.
'They were voting against political centralisation and the institutional
aspects of the union more than the economic and exchange rate aspects of the
system,' he said.
European stock markets were mostly quiet although Italian shares were driven
lower over worries that the Italian economy would lose the benefits of
con-vergence between European interest and inflation rates should monetary
union un-ravel.
Spanish shares also continued to slide but prices are expected to stabilise
in the short-term.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DUBLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DUBLIN government remained adamant yesterday that it would press ahead
with a referendum on the Maastricht treaty on June 18, despite growing
pressure from opposition groups to postpone it, and mounting confusion over
the issue.
An unlikely alliance of environmentalists, anti-abortionists,
pro-abortionists, disarmament groups, centre-left politicians and
pro-neutrality groups have joined voices in calling for a postponement. They
say time should be given to assess the implications of any efforts to
resurrect the treaty under a different format. This could mean another
referendum would have to be held, rendering the June 18 one irrelevant, they
say.
Growing schisms in the Yes camp suggest that the result of the referendum
could now be very close instead of the expected large vote in favour.
The government's draft wording of the referendum is also likely to give
encouragement to the No and anti-referendum campaigners. It is a page of
text couched in highly legalistic terminology, which even well-informed
voters are likely to have difficulty understanding, raising concern that
many votes may be spoiled or cast mistakenly.
A government spokesman insisted yesterday, however, that a 'growing
responsibility' is now being thrust on Ireland to save the Maastricht treaty
and that an all-out effort will be made to secure a Yes vote. He said the
Danish decision 'has removed any sense of complacency about the campaign'
and added that 'if Ireland did vote No, it would be a major blow to the EC'.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Major seeks to defuse revolt by MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR yesterday sought to defuse a threatened revolt by Conservative
MPs over the Maastricht accord by signalling that he was ready to postpone
for several weeks the legislation to implement the threatened treaty.
His cautious approach came after some of his cabinet colleagues echoed
backbench warnings that an attempt to push through the legislation before
the future of the accord had been clarified might split the government's
support.
Tory opponents of closer European integration claimed that the Danish
voters' decision this week to reject the Maastricht treaty on economic and
monetary union had wrecked UK chances of ratifying the deal.
A parliamentary motion calling for a 'fresh start' in shaping the future of
the European Community along non-federalist lines attracted the immediate
support of 70 Conservative MPs. Its sponsors said the figure would reach 100
by today. Leading Euro-sceptics claimed also that up to a dozen junior
members of the government had signalled their opposition to any move to
resurrect the agreement.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Major said he was convinced that the
best outcome for the EC would be an arrangement to press ahead with the deal
on economic and monetary union. He warned that an attempt to unravel it
could threaten the concessions the UK had won from its European partners.
Earlier, the prime minister had told the cabinet that any suggestion that
Britain was about to renege on the agreement would undermine seriously its
authority when it takes over the EC presidency at the beginning of next
month.
But during a 30-minute discussion at the weekly meeting, some of Mr Major's
senior colleagues were said to have cautioned the prime minister against
pressing ahead too quickly with legislation to ratify the agreement.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, was said by colleagues to be among those
viewing the Danish rejection of the treaty and the doubts surfacing
elsewhere in Europe as a vindication of Britain's opt-out clause from
economic and monetary union. Others were said to be relaxed about the
possibility that it might prove impossible for the EC to salvage anything
from the wreckage of the Danish referendum.
Conservative party managers at Westminster insisted that they remained
relaxed about any potential revolt, pointing to a statement last night from
Sir Marcus Fox, the chairman of the 1922 backbench committee of Conservative
MPs, expressing full confidence in Mr Major's stance. They also took comfort
from the continuing disarray within the Labour party over the stance it
should adopt.
But the prime minister is understood to have agreed that it would be unwise
to bring back the Maastricht legislation while the outlook remained so
uncertain. That meant the detailed line-by-line examination of the bill was
unlikely to begin until after the Lisbon summit at the end of this month.

FT  05 JUN 92 / EC pledges to keep door open for Danes: Renegotiation of
treaty ruled out as ministers play down vote crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community nations yesterday promised to 'keep the door open' for
Denmark to change its mind and join the political and monetary union set out
in the Maastricht treaty.
But they declared there would be no renegotiation of the treaty, which
Danish voters narrowly rejected on Tuesday.
EC foreign ministers, in an emergency session in Oslo, ruled out a special
summit to deal with the crisis. They said they would pursue ratification of
Maastricht 'on the basis of the existing text' by the year end.
Ministers sought to play down the crisis in spite of its potential to
sabotage the plans painstakingly negotiated at Maastricht.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark's strongly pro-EC foreign minister, joined
his 11 colleagues in confirming that they wanted 'to see the European union
established by all member states'.
He was well received when he told the others that the Danish government
acknowledged that Maastricht could not now be renegotiated, that it would
keep all its options open, and that it needed time to decide what to do.
The vote was 'No to Maastricht, but not No to Europe', Mr Ellemann-Jensen
stressed. Even the anti-EC minority in the Danish parliament concurred with
that interpretation, he added.
Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, said he might call a second
referendum if Denmark could win support for a 'special arrangement' at a
conference in the autumn.
Denmark's partners, discreetly encouraged by the Danish government, clearly
hope that ratification by the 11 other states will exert growing pressure on
Danish opinion as this year wears on.
'We need a period of calm reflection,' said Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary. 'We, British, will go forward with our legislation to ratify
Maastricht,' he said, adding that the Danish referendum 'has had an effect
on some of those among the British people who were prepared to give
Maastricht the benefit of the doubt in the first instance'.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign minister, who chaired
yesterday's meeting, praised the 'solidarity and cohesion' shown by
ministers. Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, whose brainchild of
monetary union is now at risk, said: 'Even if we have a little crisis, we
shall overcome it.'
Ministers deliberately put off consideration of the legal complexities
raised by the possibility of Denmark being left behind by its partners. EC
legal experts will meet their Danish counterparts, but their findings will
not be ripe for political decision 'for the next few weeks or months'.
Mr Hurd said he expected yesterday's session to be the first in a series of
ministerial discussions on Denmark's future and the fate of Maastricht,
which has still to be definitively ratified by any EC state. Its next test
is Ireland's June 18 referendum.
Mr Pinheiro ruled out advancing the June 26-27 Lisbon summit to discuss the
crisis, or convening any special summit. Indeed, Mr Hurd doubted whether the
problem would even be discussed at Lisbon, such is the desire of EC
governments to pretend they are conducting business as usual.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Lloyd's will ask each Name for Pounds 20,000 to boost
solvency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY MEMBER of Lloyd's of London will have to pay on average Pounds 20,000
to bolster the troubled insurance market's central fund. Lloyd's, which is
facing record losses, will double the size of the fund to Pounds 1bn by
means of the compulsory charge.
The fund can be used to pay any claims falling on Lloyd's when Names - the
individuals who provide the insurance market's capital - are unable to meet
their obligations.
A few thousand Lloyd's Names will bear the brunt of the market's record
losses for 1989, which will be reported later this month. Earlier this week,
they were forecast to top Pounds 2bn. Many Names have insufficient assets to
pay claims and face potential bankruptcy.
Mr Alan Lord, Lloyd's chief executive, said that Lloyd's had 'solid legal
opinion' that it was authorised to take the action which would provide a
'substantial margin of solvency'.
The increase is to be financed by a one-time levy on all Names who have
participated in the market in the 1990, 1991 and 1992 underwriting years.
The levy will amount to 1.66 per cent of stamp (the amount of premiums Names
are allowed to accept under Lloyd's rules) per year. In 1990 the annual levy
already paid by Names was increased from 0.35 per cent to 0.6 per cent.
On average, Names face a bill exceeding Pounds 20,000, although this will
not generally be charged until 1993, 1994 and 1995, when, in line with the
market's three-year accounting system, agents settle Names' individual
accounts for the affected years.
In the first instance, the money is to be drawn from the Names' premium
trust funds into which premium income earned by syndicates is channelled.
The first payments will be made in mid-July.
Mr David Coleridge, chairman, described the levy as a 'prudent response to
especially difficult trading circumstances. The Council's action will give a
strong and reassuring signal to policyholders',
Mr Lord said the Lloyd's Council, the market's governing body which approved
the special levy on Wednesday, was still discussing a separate plan to help
many of the hardest hit Names.
Mr Val Powell, chief executive of the Association of Lloyd's Members, which
represents over 9,000 Names, said the levy was 'uncomfortable but
inevitable. It is an essential prerequisite to get us through the next two
years.'

FT  05 JUN 92 / Executives named in US insider trading lawsuit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Securities and Exchange Commission yesterday filed one of the biggest
insider trading cases ever brought by the US government, charging seven
prominent businessmen with insider trading offences.
The filing named, among others, Mr Martin Revson, a former chief executive
of Dell Labs and brother of Revlon co-founder Mr Charles Revson, and Mr
Edward Downe, a former director of New York broking house Bear Stearns. It
alleged the seven were part of an insider trading ring which made millions
of dollars in illegal profits during the late 1980s.
In a separate criminal action, Mr Downe yesterday pleaded guilty to tax
fraud and securities law violations related to his attempts to conceal
illegal profits from insider trading. He will be sentenced in September and
faces up to five years in prison and Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 275,000) in
fines.
The five other businessmen named in the SEC suit are: Mr Steven Greenberg, a
former chairman of Anametrics, a New York public relations firm; Mr Thomas
Warde, a Los Angeles property developer; Mr Milton Weinger, a broker with
securities house Oppenheimer &amp; Co; Mr David Salamone, a London-based broker
with Drexel, Burnham Lambert; and Mr Fred Sullivan, former chairman of
manufacturing and service company Kidde.
In a statement last night, Mr Weinger 'categorically denied all charges'.
The lawsuit, filed in a New York federal court, alleges that between 1987
and 1989 the men were involved in a scheme which traded the securities of
several US companies, including Bear Stearns, Revlon and Gillette, mostly
through a Bermuda-based company called Broadsword, claimed to have been set
up by Mr Downe and Mr Salamone to handle the secret trades.
The SEC said it had discovered a 'pattern of purchases in advance of
disclosure of material corporate events', and in each case Mr Downe 'had a
friend who was an insider to the acquiring or target company'. The SEC
alleged that Mr Downe made illegal profits of more than Dollars 8m, Mr
Greenberg Dollars 6.1m and Mr Weinger Dollars 2.3m. The other members of the
ring were also alleged to have made significant profits.
The SEC will seek the return of all the alleged profits, including any money
made by those, such as Mr Sullivan, who allegedly supplied inside
information.
Mr Sullivan submitted an offer of settlement to the SEC, neither admitting
nor denying liability, which would involve making a Dollars 59,000 payment.
This was awaiting a response from a judge last night. SEC officials said the
offer was likely to be accepted.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of Vehicle Manufacturing Technology (10): Focus on
use of plastics - Recycling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFF DANIELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE rarely visits a vehicle manufacturer these days without being given a
briefing on recycling. For the most part, such briefings follow a standard
pattern as least where content is concerned.
The starting point is that vehicles are already more efficiently recycled
than any other consumer durable, with up to 75 per cent of their content by
weight already reclaimed and used again. That 75 per cent, it is then
admitted, roughly corresponds to the metallic content.
The focus of attention is now the remaining 25 per cent, and in particular
that proportion of it which is plastic.
The standard presentation tends to make three points. First, plastics are
now carefully chosen with an eye to recycling. Polypropylene, which is
easily re-used, has suddenly become the material of choice for plastic
bumper covers, and the point is invariably made that far fewer different
plastics are being used in manufacture.
Second, all plastic parts above a certain weight - usually either 50g or
100g - are marked to show exactly what material they are made from. This is
to overcome a notable drawback of plastic materials: they are difficult to
identify.
Third, body designers now take care to ensure that plastic components can be
easily removed for recycling and due consideration is being given to the
best way of re-using such components.
Here, opinion is split between the 'like-for-like' approach which insists
that plastic components must be capable of re-emerging in the same form, and
the 'cascade' philosophy which suggests it is equally effective and less
expensive to use recovered plastic for successively less demanding
applications on each occasion.
The cascade system envisages taking a high quality, visible application such
as a bumper cover and turning it perhaps into invisible wheel-arch liners,
then into an sound-deadening pad and finally into a packing-piece or
container for a new production part.
Given an average car life of 12 years (and rising), this would put plastic
to good use for up to half a century.
The purists, however, argue that this is not good enough. Volkswagen, for
example, is determined to turn bumper covers into bumper covers; by no means
easily achieved, since quality of surface finish is the first quality to
suffer when plastic from such 'visible' applications is recycled.
There is, in any case, no question that concerns over recycling have caused
vehicle designers to reconsider their use of plastics. Not only has the
number of different plastics in a vehicle body been greatly reduced, but the
actual proportion of plastic is coming down for the first time in many
years.
In particular, designers are shying away from high-strength plastic
composites - mainly glass-reinforced materials - because the only way they
can currently be recycled is to shred them, at some cost, and send them
directly to the base of the 'cascade'.
This in turn has set back the cause of lightweight, rust-free plastic body
panels because only the composite materials have the mechanical strength
necessary, especially for large horizontal panels such as the roof and
bonnet.
The particular concern over plastics should not, however, be allowed to
overshadow the mechanics of vehicle recycling in general. Several
manufacturers, including BMW and VW in Germany, PSA and Renault in France
and Rover in the UK, have set up pilot projects for the recovery and
disposal of scrapped vehicles.
Such operations highlight the fact that many of the non-metallic components
of a vehicle including the tyres, glass, fluids (oil, coolant, and brake
fluid, and in some cases the chlorofluorocarbons-laden air conditioning
refrigerant) as well as the several kilograms of dirt accumulated beneath
any vehicle during its life, all pose problems from the recycling point of
view.
The recycling projects now under way all work on the principle of recovering
higher-value and 'difficult' items more or less intact before sending the
rest of the body to be granulated. The residue is sorted into various grades
of re-useable material and the inevitable remainder is incinerated at very
high temperature into a dense ash which can be used directly as hardcore or
incorporated into cement. The technology of material sorting is one of the
more closely guarded secrets of such operations; when PSA held a press
presentation at its pilot recycling plant near Lyons, that section of the
'works' was shielded from view, although samples of impressively well-sorted
debris were on display.
There is no doubt that concern over recycling has posed another constraint
on vehicle designers at a time when most of them probably thought they
already had enough to be going on with. Their choice of materials has become
more restricted and they are having to give much more thought to the
question of easy disassembly at the end of the vehicle's life.
The signs are, however, that ingenuity will overcome these constraints
without affecting the appearance of the vehicle itself.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of Vehicle Manufacturing Technology (9): Scope for
more machinery - Final Assembly
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS BARRIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASK A CAR buyer which bit of his car was most difficult to build and the
chances are that he or she will name the engine or the car body.
In fact, the most time-consuming, and therefore expensive, task is when
engine, gearbox, suspension and interior trim are placed and fixed in the
painted car body - a process known as final assembly.
To please the customer the car company must offer many different options on
each basic car.
Apart from different engine sizes and gearboxes, the production line has to
cater for a myriad of differences in interior trim: colours, fabrics,
equipment, and tinted glass.
Take Ford's latest Escort, built at the Halewood plant on Merseyside. There
are more than 100 variations in the bumper fitted to this car depending on
colour and specification.
Similarly there are up to 90 variations in the body side moulding, 60
variations in the door mirrors, and between 140 and 260 variations in the
door trim panels according to the model mix being built at the plant.
The complexity of choosing the right component and fitting it into the right
model has left these areas of the factory dominated by men and women, not
machines. It has also made this part of car construction the area where, on
the surface, greatest efficiency gains should be possible.
The International Motor Vehicle Programme (IVMP) - an international study
carried out by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - found that final
assembly accounts for about 15 per cent of the final value of the car, a
significant proportion.
Typically in Europe it takes 15 hours of assembly time per car to carry out
final assembly, compared with four hours to paint the car and five to weld
it together (direct labour only).
By contrast, according to the IMVP, a typical Japanese plant needs six hours
of final assembly per car, two hours for paint and three hours for body
construction - a clear competitive advantage to the Japanese.
There is no escape from the complexity of the tasks to be carried out on
final assembly. Customers will continue wanting more, not fewer, options.
And in any case it is not the complexity itself which makes a factory
efficient. The IMVP study suggested that the factories coping with the most
complex cars were also the most productive, and they were Japanese.
So what are the solutions to making final assembly more efficient? Needless
to say, companies are choosing different ways ahead.
The most obvious answer is to do to final assembly what has already been
done elsewhere in the car factory: use machines instead of men. Machines
will work flat out all day every day to uniformly high quality standards.
The rising cost of labour makes automation more attractive. And as fewer
people want to work in car factories these days, especially in Japan,
machines are having to be used, whether cost effective or not.
There is certainly scope for more machinery. The proportion of direct steps
carried out by automation in Europe is, on average, just 3 per cent. In
Japan the equivalent is 7 per cent. The typical European bodyshop has 77 per
cent of its action automated, compared with 86 per cent in Japan.
Automation suppliers are confident that they can provide the answers. Mr Kai
Warn, Brussels-based manager of automotive sales support for ABB Robotics,
says automation is just becoming cost-effective in final assembly.
He estimates that the cost of robots has fallen by 30 per cent in the past
five years while their performance has risen by the same amount over the
same period.
Mr Warn estimates that the real advance in automation will come in the next
two to three years as new cars come on stream having been designed with
automation in mind.
But it is worth adding a caveat: design a car for easier automation, and you
make it easier for a man to assemble, too. Ford looked long and hard at
automating final assembly of the Sierra replacement, the CDW27, and appears
to have ruled it out as still not cost effective.
But there are companies that have automated already. Fiat builds its Tipo
car on highly automated lines at Cassino in Italy. The factory has more than
100 computers, 400 robots, 24 lasers, more than 1200 wire guided trollies
and 480 automatic guided vehicles. It is the most highly automated factory
in the world.
Similarly, Volkswagen builds the Golf on highly-automated lines, while
Citroen uses automation to carry out large numbers of final assembly tasks
on the XM executive car at Rennes in France.
But there are constraints in such an approach. The high cost of
sophisticated automation systems makes high production volume a must. Yet
the complexity of the systems can mean frequent break-downs, adding to
indirect costs, as systems engineers wrestle with the problems.
Professor Dan Jones of Cardiff Business School says the Cassino plant will
only be cost-effective if it runs at full capacity. And that in turn means
Fiat will need another less efficient car plant elsewhere capable of turning
Tipo production on and off according to fluctuating demand.
Similarly, automation can inhibit new model design by forcing engineers to
cut costs by using tooling installed for the old model. The Volkswagen Golf
is often cited as a case in point.
Instead of trying to replace the workforce, some companies are turning to
automation as a means of using people more effectively. Citroen automates
tasks that are ergonomically awkward. And Jones suggests that automation
should be used to tackle the simple repetitive tasks, not the
labour-intensive pinchpoints on a production line where workforce numbers
may be reduced but the automation left with an impossibly complicated job -
and the people with an impossibly boring set of simple jobs.
Instead of being concerned with machines, some managers are turning to two
sets of people for help: the workforce and the supplier.
Unlocking the skill in the workforce can be extremely effective. Rover
achieved huge improvements to productivity and quality by asking its
workforce to examine prototypes of the new Rover 800 executive car before it
went into production. Similarly, Nissan's car factory in Sunderland is one
of the least automated but most efficient in Europe because of the
management skill in running the factory efficiently.
All car companies will simplify their own tasks by asking suppliers to do
more. Instead of assembling cars under one roof, car companies will receive
built-up modules such as dashboards, seats or mouldings ready for
installation into the car.
But whichever route a company chooses it must get the cost analysis right.
Automation can be hugely expensive. But so is failure to use the workforce.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of Vehicle Manufacturing Technology (8): Fresh
challenges - The machine tools industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CEDRIC ASHLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN relationship to the vehicle industry, machine tools should not in any way
be thought of in isolation, but instead as part of a system. Indeed, it is a
complex system going back to the moment of conception of the motor vehicle.
The present 'buzz word' is 'simultaneous engineering' in which design,
development, tooling, manufacture, assembly and quality are all considered
together at the same time.
It both reduces the key lead time between between initiation of a project
and selling on the market place, and it ensures that the optimum blend of
technologies is brought to bear on the complex process of creating a motor
car.
In this process, the technology of manufacture is decided, at least in some
detail, at the same time as the first part is drawn. The most complex
element is the body and it is now possible to go directly from a computer
model to the press tool to manufacture the part.
Normally, there is an intermediate stage in which a styling model is created
in foam or a special form of very high density wood material. This model may
be tweaked by the stylist, either at the computer or through traditional
methods of reshaping using modelling clay.
The next stage is production of tools for prototype manufacture and finally
the production tools. In all these cases, use is made of a three- or
five-axis profiling machine. Indeed, the whole process can be handled on the
computer to cover the design of the body tools, the jigs, the fixtures, even
the production line.
It is even possible to use a computer simulator of the whole process, so
that it can be optimised at an early stage.
Quality to a manufacturing engineer is the capability of the production
process to produce a part to specification. We now look for a zero defect
production process in which every part is produced right every time.
Quality is not a measure of the skill of the individual operator, and indeed
the production process is generally organised in such a way that accurate
manufacture to specification does not depend on operator skill.
This means that any computer-controlled production machine must not only
receive computer-generated information about what it has to do, but also
computer read information on acceptable limits and sensors to check and
verify that those limits have been met. Much of the technology advance has
been in sensor development.
There is also considerable interest in the arrangement of machine tools
within the factory. In the late sixties, group technology was initiated
where groups of machines were put together to manufacture specific parts to
minimise transfer time between machines and stock holding. To some extent
the machining centres have superceded the six- to 10-machine group of
dedicated machines, but the concept is now being developed further in terms
of the product cell.
In this concept, an operational unit is formed to produce a specific small
family of units such as electric motors, water pumps, etc. This allows
minimum stockholding within the unit.
In such a unit, a time lag as short as 12 hours may exist between initiation
of demand for a product variation and such a variation being produced at the
end of the line.
A further key element in the selection of the production process is
flexibility. The speed of product development is such that extensive changes
in the product can occur in three- to four-year time spans and these must be
accommodated.
At one time, transfer lines had such rigid constraints that design and
development was inhibited. We now expect full flexibility from the transfer
line to accept both extensive design change and product variation within a
short time spell.
There has long been a financial investment and return hierarchy in machine
tools starting off at the basic building block, the CNC machine such as a
lathe, drilling machine or miller.
The next stage is the machining centre capable of a variety of operations
through multiple tool changes and modes of operation. The Flexible
Manufacturing System (FMS) effectively links together machining centres and
finally we have the dedicated transfer line.
The trick is to know the volume break point at which to invest in the next
level of machine. These boundaries are continuously moving upwards.
Some recent developments illustrate these points. Vauxhall has just
commissioned a new large transfer press at Ellesmere Port which is notable
for its rapid changeover of tools.
Tools for the next run are placed on sliding bolsters and are automatically
changed at the time, using photo-sensors to ensure correct location with
automatic clamping. The computer controls the usual press operation setting
up variations and within 13 minutes a completely different pressed part can
be produced. In the last decade, more than 24 hours would be necessary for a
tool change of such complexity.
Adwest has just commissioned a novel machine for producing variable-ratio
steering racks using a CNC lathe. By combining movement of six elements, two
cams, two angular axes and two linear axes, the complex form was turned
rather than ground. Tooling costs were reduced by a factor of 10 and the
cycle-time reduced from five minutes to only two minutes.
Ford in the US is to build a transfer line in conjunction with several
unit-type machines to produce Zeta crankshafts. A novel feature of two of
the unit machines will be to use rotary broaching to machine the crank pins,
as opposed to turning.
Emissions requirements have led Cummins to an improvement in cylinder block
machining. The bores are now being honed with the block clamped in such a
way as to simulate the distortions caused when the cylinder head is bolted
into place. This gives improved bore roundness in service and reduces oil
consumption and hence particulate emissions.
These examples show some of the challenges which have been met. Computing
power for machine tools is falling in cost, but the consumer is demanding
even higher standards of the end product of his vehicle than before.
Machines are faster, smarter and more flexible; we expect many more
developments in the near future in the world of automation and machine
tools. It is recognised by the CBI and many others that this is one of the
key areas for new investment if the UK is to retain a viable manufacturing
base.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of Vehicle Manufacturing Technology (11): Rapidly
evolving - Materials handling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS BARRIE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 10,000 components make up an average car and they all have to be
brought to the right area of the production line at the right time.
Once on the production line, the components have to be moved from one
assembly station to the next at a given speed and often be positioned with
great accuracy.
The materials handling equipment designed to do this ferrying has evolved
rapidly as the demands made of it have become greater. Production lines are
having to make a greater variety of car models, requiring a more complex mix
of parts. Simultaneously, production managers are reducing stock holdings,
demanding more frequent delivery to the lineside to more precise timing.
The traditional method of transferring parts to the line is to use people,
forklift trucks and towed trollies. The system needs to be flexible and
fast, and it is hard to foresee how sophisticated automation will replace
it. But the other aspects of car production are more heavily automated.
There are three types of equipment in widespread use:
Automatic guided vehicles. AGVs were bought in large numbers five years ago
by some companies, especially General Motors and Volvo. They are flexible,
quiet and extremely effective in certain applications. But the surge of
interest in the early days of the technology has led to a reappraisal of AGV
use within the car industry - and some disenchantment.
Volvo's engine factory in Skovde has more than 260 AGVs. According to Mr
Greger Lundesjo, managing director of supplier BT Rolatruc Systems, the
application suits the technology because the Swedish place a high value on
working environment and because Volvo has a sound understanding of the
technology.
AGVs are expensive, but the numbers can be matched to production increases
to avoid high start-up costs. AGVs can also be effective when used for
complex operations that are best carried out off the main production line:
Mercedes-Benz uses AGVs for certain assembly operations, feeding the
completed assemblies back into the main line which runs free of potential
interruptions.
Chain conveyors. The traditional method of moving car bodies down a
production line will continue for years despite competition from more
sophisticated alternatives. The Japanese car companies are replacing many
basic conveyors to reduce noise and improve working conditions to offset
recruitment difficulties. But cost and noise reduction measures will ensure
this type of conveyor is bought by many plants in future.
Self-propelled monorail carriers. More expensive than traditional conveyors,
these lines will deliver large components or car bodies to a predetermined
pattern. The parts or bodies travel on powered trollies, their movement
tracked by computer.
The Japanese car factories are turning to these systems to replace old chain
conveyors. The systems are often used to feed a principal production line
that is less flexible and has to be kept running at constant speed.
Because of the sophistication of the production process and different
priorities, car companies will choose a mix of materials handling equipment
in future rather than be wooed by one-stop solutions.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of Vehicle Manufacturing Technology (6): Machines are
now used for tasks beyond spot welding - Robots
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROBOTS have become an established part of the vehicle manufacturing scene
over the past 15 years. The motor industry accounts for as much as 40 per
cent of the 450,000 installed industrial robots worldwide but their use is
changing and applications are expanding.
The traditional picture of long lines of robots each making billions of spot
welds on car bodies in a working life of eight to 10 years is still true,
but only half the story. Those same welding robots are as likely to be
grouped in flexible manufacturing cells and capable of handling a wide range
of models in quick succession.
At the same time, smaller robots are increasingly being used in engine
assembly, where their ability to do quality, repetitive work with a
precision of 1/100th of a millimetre is much in demand. Robots are being
used in final assembly work and paint spraying, and suppliers hope to be
able to develop these markets now that the technology has been proven.
There is an emerging trend for robots to be used in automotive
sub-contracting, prompted by the vehicle manufacturers' need to be as
confident in the consistency and quality of out-sourced components as for
their own work.
The shorter lives of car models, prompted by increased competition in the
industry and the Japanese producers' early efforts to reduce product
development times, are changing the use and design of robots.
The traditional practice of replacing a robot after two model cycles may
have been appropriate when each car model was lasting six to eight years.
But with model lives reduced to three to four years, users want to keep
their robots for further models, and thus want increased flexibility,
according to Dr Axel Gerhardt, a senior board member at the holding company
for Kuka, Germany's largest robot supplier.
Many of the latest trends in the use of robotics originated in Japan where
labour shortages have spurred much greater penetration of robots into
industry overall compared with Europe and the US. But robot suppliers such
as ABB Robotics, the largest in Europe, believe the European automotive
industry is as enthusiastic a user of robotic automation as its Japanese
counterpart.
However, some of the more recent applications of robots are less prevalent
in Europe, giving an opportunity to suppliers if they can convince producers
of the economic benefits. There are national variations too: the UK is a
long way behind the US and the rest of Europe in the use of robots in the
paint shop, says Mr Mike Wilson, UK sales and marketing director at GMFanuc
Robotics.
The versatility of modern industrial robots for tasks that go beyond spot
welding is illustrated by Kuka's involvement in final assembly of the
Citroen XM. Following painting, robots dismount the doors and tailgate, with
the aid of sensors, for completion on separate trim lines; the cockpit is
picked up by robot from an automatic guided vehicle, inserted through the
door and then bolted to the body by a second robot.
Robots are used for applying the adhesive sealants and for fitting the glass
exactly into the body aperture with the aid of ultrasonic scanners; seats
are inserted by robot after measuring the exact position of the body by
means of tactile sensors, wheels are mounted and doors and tailgate
refitted.
Some of these tasks are difficult for robots because of the nature of final
assembly. Robots are having to operate in a less structured environment,
says Mr Wilson, and deal with less defined objects such as seats.
Another problem, at least outside Japan, is that labour is available and
costs less than in skilled manufacturing areas. So robot suppliers have to
find applications that create added value, says Mr Stelio Demark, head of
ABB Robotics.
There are still opportunities for greater use of robots further up the
production line. Relatively new processes such as laser-cutting and
water-jet cutting are likely to become more prevalent, in association with
robots, especially for working with plastics and new advanced composites.
Mr Demark sees a substantial increase in automated arc-welding in the
automotive industry and sub-suppliers. And Comau, the Italian robotics and
systems group, expects some interesting investments in the body area,
prompted by the increased need for new models, according to Mr Massimo
Mattucci, vice-president for engineering and marketing.
In paint spraying, says Mr Demark, robots have hardly scratched the surface.
Last year, ABB strengthened its position in the robotic painting market with
the acquisition of Graco in the US, but GMFanuc, a US/Japanese concern, and
Behr of Germany have strong positions.
The flexibility of robots to handle model changes will be the key to their
further implementation in the car body area. In engine and transmission
production, robots are becoming better established, and Mr Mattucci suggests
a new generation of engines prompted by tougher environmental regulations
could be the spur to further investment in robots.
However, an increasing portion of business for robot suppliers seems likely
to come from refurbishment of existing robots rather than new purchases as
customers seek maximum value from their manufacturing investments.
In the past three or four years, this has been a growing trend of robot
refitting and modification in the motor industry, carried out during model
changeovers and restoring robots to previous levels of accuracy and
productivity.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of Vehicle Manufacturing Technology (7): New trends
and challenges - Developments in paints and coatings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENVIRONMENTAL pressures may be increasing on industry as a whole, but few
processes are closer to the sharp end of the debate than the motor
industry's paint shops.
Based on annual production of 10m cars, European manufacturers are using an
estimated 70,000 tons of solvent during the painting processes, the majority
of which is released into the atmosphere.
Emission controls are being tightened up, and common EC-wide legislation is
expected. But the environmental factor is only one of several trends which
makes the paint shop one of the most complex, and rapidly changing, areas of
modern vehicle manufacturing.
The need for better-looking and longer-lasting finishes, for a higher level
of automation to increase productivity, and more sophisticated control
systems to enable greater production flexibility are all increasing the
challenges for equipment suppliers.
The major suppliers - Durr of Germany with its sister company Behr, the Asea
Brown Boveri subsidiaries Flakt and Ransburg, and Taikisha of Japan - are
adapting to the growing demand for turnkey packages while keeping abreast of
a multi-disciplinary process involving everything from computers to sludge
removal systems.
Recent installations in the UK motor industry illustrate the trends clearly.
Vauxhall's newly-commissioned Pounds 60m paint unit at its Ellesmere Port
Astra manufacturing plant has Europe's first operational MAP (Manufacturing
and Automation Protocol) 3.0 network. MAP is a means of maintaining
efficient, reliable high-speed communications between factory-floor
computers.
The plant also has an innovative 'flocculation' system, designed to recover
paint overspray, developed as an experiment by Air Industrie, a subsidiary
of GEC Alsthom, and GM's European Technical Development Centre. Work is
continuing on ways to use the recovered paint, perhaps as a filler material
in compounded sound deadener pads.
Further south, at Iveco Ford Truck's Langley plant, the Iveco New Cargo line
has a fully automated Behr paint spraying system, equipped with four robots
and claimed to be the first in Europe to spray a complete cab automatically
in a single pass.
The system, designed for frequent colour changes, can handle 16 body styles
and 24 colours. Bodies are fed to the spray booth at random and the required
style and colour programme called up by an operator on a simple keypad at
the entrance to the spray booth. Thereafter, the complete spraying operation
is fully automatic and computer controlled.
Pre-treatment ahead of painting is also the target of investment. At Rover's
Cowley factory, a new body pre-treatment plant installed by Durr has
replaced the old spray dip system with a new full immersion pre-treatment
process, producing better corrosion protection.
Meanwhile, at the luxury end of the industry, Rolls-Royce has installed the
latest Behr two-component paint system. Known as 2K, the system mixes
precise quantities of paint and hardener immediately before they are applied
to the car body.
All these systems offer environmental benefits - the 2K process, for
example, requires a lower stoving temperature than typical single component
materials and thus consumes less energy.
According to Durr, the cost of new automotive paint plants will need to
increase by 20 per cent, or Pounds 1m-Pounds 2m, to accommodate new UK
emission regulations - operators have until September to submit approved
plans to local authorities for complying with the 1990 Environmental
Protection Act.
The response to the regulations takes a number of forms, according to Mr
John Barlow, Durr's UK managing director. On the materials side, there is a
move away from solvent-based paints to water-based paints - water-based
primers have been used for some years. Solvents are used to get the paint
airborne, and their replacement by water-based systems requires new sprayers
and a completely new stainless steel plant.
Where solvents are used, paints with higher solid contents have been
developed to reduce emissions. This is a further advantage of the 2K
process, which has a high solids content of up to 70 per cent.
New paint technologies, such as powder-coating are also being tried, but in
this case implementation in car plants is a long way off, says Mr Barlow.
The emission problem is solved but the spraying equipment is too wasteful.
Controlling and treating emissions, whether of air-borne solvents, or
paint-polluted water, is the other main area where technology is being
driven by the emission regulations and tougher rules. This has led to demand
for more sophisticated scrubbing and incineration systems, such as catalytic
incinerators, and water recycling equipment.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of Vehicle Manufacturing Technology (4): A technology
which is still developing - Castings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JEFF DANIELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH cast iron is one of the oldest engineering materials, it still
plays a big role in vehicle engine manufacture. The majority of vehicles on
the road today use cast iron cylinder blocks, and many of them use the
material also for crankshafts. The only alternative material of
significance, and the most widely used for cylinder heads as well as for
transmission (gearbox and final drive) casings, is cast aluminium alloy.
It follows that casting technology remains a key factor in the production of
vehicle drivelines; it may also gain greater importance in other areas.
The two main driving forces in the development of casting technology today
are the desire to automate production as far as practicable, and to achieve
further improvements in the accuracy and consistency of the castings
produced. The greatest attention has been devoted not to the actual
materials used for casting, these having already been optimised over many
decades (centuries, in the case of cast iron) but to the techniques of the
process and the materials used for the core-making.
The basic technique of casting is to form a mould by assembling several
'cores' of some suitable material, and then to pour in the molten metal.
When the metal has cooled, the cores are removed to leave the rough casting
ready for machining and assembly.
The traditional core material is compacted sand, which has the twin virtues
of resistance to the high temperatures involved, and of (relatively) easy
removal afterwards. Its principal disadvantage is, of course, the inability
to form cores of complex shape, or of great dimensional accuracy.
Modern casting methods for complex components are increasingly based on the
'lost material' process, which finds its origins in the 'lost wax' process
long used by dentists to form dentures, and later adopted by the aircraft
gas turbine industry as the most accurate way of forming turbine blades. In
this process the core material, whether conventional sand or some more
advanced composite of sand and stabiliser, is inserted around an accurate
blank reproduction of the component itself. The blank is made from a
material which melts or vaporises at molten metal temperatures (polystyrene
foam is most widely used) and is expelled from the mould having performed
its task of ensuring dimensional accuracy.
Another aspect of casting now closely studied is the means of filling the
mould. Simple pouring has been complemented in some cases by vacuum
assistance, used for instance by Toyota in the manufacture of large cylinder
blocks, or by positive pressure, widely employed by the French car
manufacturers for the production of aluminium alloy cylinder blocks and
heads. Pressure die-casting is an expensive process, calling for massive
investment in production machinery, but it produces extremely accurate and
'clean' components which need a minimum of fettling and subsequent
machining. Even where such techniques are not used, it has become
commonplace to study metal flow into a mould by computer simulation, using a
combination of hydrodynamic and thermal transfer calculations, to achieve
the quickest filling and the most satisfactory grain flow in the final
component.
Accuracy of production has become an important factor in all modern casting.
The engine designer is under pressure to save weight, and is greatly helped
by being able to depend on thin walled castings of sufficient consistency.
The smaller the production variation from the intended wall thicknes, the
thinner the walls can be made, and the lighter the block becomes (with a
useful complementary saving in material and process energy costs). The order
of magnitude improvement achieved, mainly in the USA, in the accuracy of
iron casting during the 1950s enabled the material to remain competitive
when for a time it seemed its position would be almost completely usurped by
aluminium alloy.
Modern production techniques marry advanced core technology with accurate
core placing, often now carried out by robot, and the 'back to back'
production of several components at a time, as practiced by PSA's main
cylinder block foundry in France. Techniques and materials are selected on
the basis of close financial scrutiny; nobody uses an expensive method where
 cheaper one will suffice, and reinforced sand cores still give good results
especially where component design has been carefully considered to ease
casting problems. The fundamentally simple design of modern cylinder blocks,
helped by the removal of the camshaft to the cylinder head, has been a
blessing for the foundrymaster.
Aluminium alloy castings may also soon find a place in body engineering,
which has hitherto been the reserve of welded sheet steel pressings.
Research carried out by Alcoa has resulted in castings which are relatively
ductile, and avoid the brittleness which until now has been a characteristic
(due to porosity and gas inclusion) of all cast materials. Alcoa now
suggests that car body 'skeletons' could be built up from precision extruded
beams slotted into cast 'junction boxes", with substantial weight savings.
The company has already established a German factory to manufacture
sub-assemblies on this basis, its first customer being Audi. If the venture
succeeds and the technique becomes widespread, casting could become an even
more significant technology for the motor industry of the future.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of Vehicle Manufacturing Technology (3): Plastics
makers' mixed feelings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INCREASING enthusiasm among vehicle makers for aluminium as a solution to
their weight-saving and recycling problems was much in evidence at the
Society of Automotive Engineers' annual congress in Detroit two months ago.
It is a development regarded with mixed feelings, however, by the
manufacturers and processors of plastic composites.
Should the enthusiasm extend to cladding with aluminium panels the
spaceframes which would form the primary structure of an aluminium car, Dow,
DuPont, GE and others among the big plastics producers could be
disadvantaged. It is only recently that they have begun making significant
inroads into the potentially very high volume market for vehicle body
panels.
Less than two years ago, the composites sector was given a big boost with
the launch of General Motors' Dollars 4bn Saturn project in Tennessee.
Saturn saw the adoption, for the first time ever on a 100,000-plus annual
volume car, of a body comprising a steel spaceframe hung with recyclable
thermoplastic panels. Yet Saturn is only the latest of several vehicles
making extensive use of such materials to be developed by GM.
If the Saturn plant and General Motors' leisure van facilities were working
to full capacity, the composites industry would currently be supplying the
bodies for nearly 500,000 vehicles annually to GM alone, if production of
the Corvette sports car was also included. The GM vans, sold under various
badges such as Chevrolet Lumina and Pontiac TranSport, also use plastic body
panels on a steel spaceframe, with capacity available for 200,000 units a
year.
The vans' panels, however, are of thermosets, which can only be chopped up
or burned after their useful life ends whereas thermoplastics can be melted
down and used to make something else.
Nevertheless, both types have allowed GM - and in Europe, Renault with its
plastic-bodied Espace 'people carrier' - to benefit from the lower tooling
costs involved in producing moulds rather than the dies for stamping steel:
the greater flexibility of body styling which plastics allow, and the
ability to mould in one piece a complex body part which otherwise would
require the welding together of four or five separate metal pressings.
Their achilles' heel, however, is the longer cycle time inevitably needed to
produce components and recyclability.

into new areas - Computer-aided design
</HEADLINE>

THE automotive industry was one of the pioneer customers for computer-aided
design and manufacturing equipment, and remains an important testbed for new
products and applications.
Vehicle producers recognised the benefits to be gained from designing on
screen, long before phrases such as 'simultaneous' or 'concurrent
engineering' loomed over Detroit's horizon. Large companies are into their
fourth or fifth generation of equipment.
The same holds true for their suppliers, particularly in the automotive
design sector. Abbey Panels, the Coventry-based producer of full-size
vehicle body models and prototypes, realised in 1978 that it needed the best
Cadcam available to survive as a leader in vehicle modelling.
Companies such as Abbey, which uses the Euclid-IS 3D solid modelling system
produced by Matra Datavision, have taken advantage of the growing
sophistication of Cadcam software. Solid and surface modelling has become a
vital element in the success of simultaneous engineering, although by no
means a guarantee of the idea's main aims - reduced product development
times and improved quality.
For the big vehicle manufacturers, Cadcam installations are in almost
constant flux. Rover Group, for example, is spending Pounds 17m over three
years on upgrading its Computervision Cadcam facility to support its
concurrent engineering strategies while enhancing product quality. The UK
motor group has been using Computervision equipment since 1983.
Cadcam with solid modelling is expanding into areas of hitherto unparalleled
design complexity.
Lucas Commercial Diesel Systems is using a Computervision CADDS 4X system to
model complex castings for products such as its EPIC electronic fuel
injection system for high-speed diesels.
Solid modelling enables Lucas quickly to develop the correct
numerically-controlled (NC) toolpath for manufacturing the product, reducing
time-to-market and increasing quality levels.
The motor industry's voracious appetite for products and software to keep
the design process competitive is providing business for many of the smaller
players in the computer systems business.
Wisdom Systems, based in the US, has a technology called knowledge-based
engineering (KBE). It automates the simultaneous engineering strategy, and
builds a knowledge-based model incorporating not only the geometric
variations of the product but also all relevant manufacturing, costing,
production planning and marketing constraints.
The system has been tried at PSA, the holding company of Citroen and
Peugeot. It has produced an optimised design for a mechanical assembly at
increased speeds.
Another knowledge-based system used in the motor industry is Solstar,
developed by Foseco (FS) of the UK to predict the shrinkage that occurs when
metals and alloys solidify during casting. The system can deal with complex
shapes such as manifolds and cylinder blocks.
Specialist design simulation companies such as Analogy are benefiting from
the motor industry's need to check how mechanical and electronic system
designs work at an early stage in the development process.
Analogy's Saber Automotive Simulation Package, recently improved, can reduce
lead-times by analysing the operation of designs before prototyping, thus
reducing the number of design cycles needed.
Another important trend is for motor manufacturers to use 3D solid modelling
for designing tools as well as vehicles Volkswagen was one of the earliest
to recognise the potential of Cadcam in this area, having begun seven years
ago to develop AWK, a 3D, solids-based system based on Euclid-IS.
The system automates many of the repetitive tasks for tool design,
eliminating much of the tedium from making changes.
However, the most significant indirect benefit of 3D modelling in the next
few years is likely to be its role in the nascent market for rapid
prototyping equipment.
There are at least a dozen rapid prototyping systems under development or
being sold throughout the world, although some are in an early phase. But
they share one characteristic - a 3D Cad file of a part is converted into
thousands of slices and then reassembled as a real object.
The reassembling process varies widely, but the most commercially-developed
system is produced by California-based 3D Systems, which uses an ultraviolet
laser to trace the shape of a slice on to a resin stored in a vat. As the
beam completes each layer, the part is lowered a few thousands of an inch
and the process repeated.
Apart from its owner British Aerospace, Rover is believed to be the only
industrial company in the UK to have the system. It commissioned 3D Systems'
largest model last summer.
The savings in time from the process - known as stereolithography - have
been good.
A complex prototype such as an inlet manifold would conventionally have been
made by soft-tooling for aluminium, taken some 16 weeks and cost about
Pounds 22,000 for the tooling.
With stereolithography, a manifold could be run on a testbed engine three
weeks after the Cad data was supplied, at a cost of Pounds 1,200.
Two other rapid prototyping technologies are available in the UK, laminated
object manufacturing from Helisys of the US, and the Solider instant slice
curing process from the Israeli/US company Cubital. The latter has been used
to produce a complex inlet manifold for Rover.

key to future? - New Materials
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FROM next year a pioneering, Dollars 70m plant at Soest, near Dusseldorf in
Germany, will start supplying Audi, Volkswagen's prestige cars division,
with aluminium extrusions, castings and other components. These will be
turned into skeleton-like 'spaceframe' bodies for Audi's next-generation V8
saloon.
From then on, the world's motor industry is likely to start learning in
earnest just how serious a rival aluminium is likely to be for traditional
steels when it comes to the production of car bodies in anything other than
token volumes. Until now, aluminium has been used as the integral body
structure, almost exclusively for low volume and mainly expensive specialist
cars or racing cars, typified by Aston Martin or Honda's NSX. Alternatively,
it has been used as body cladding, in the form of unstressed panels, on
vehicles like the Land Rover.
The Soest plant, however, will have the capacity to produce spaceframe
components for up to 100,000 cars a year, with Audi as its first customer.
It is described by Mr Paul O'Neill, chairman of Aluminium Company of America
which is building it, as 'the single most significant programme Alcoa has
ever developed for, and with, the auto industry'.
Alcoa has spent ten years of joint research with Audi to develop the systems
and processes for what amounts to a new approach in vehicle body production,
and one expected to require, if not new forms of assembly plant systems and
techniques, then potentially considerably altered ones.
That Audi is able to contemplate such a programme at all is due to the
development, over the past decade, of new aluminium alloys, vacuum pressure
casting and extruding processes and robotic welding techniques. How well
they work in practice will determine whether Audi is right in its professed
belief that, with environmental concerns mounting, aluminium-bodied cars are
the way of the future, because of their light weight - and thus reduced
consumption of fuel - and the ability of aluminium to be totally recycled.
According to Audi design chiefs, the spaceframe body of the next V8 saloon
is likely to be up to 40 per cent lighter than its predecessor's steel body.
Alcoa's AIV (aluminium intensive vehicle) system has at its core the
production of a frame of extruded members making up the 'bones' of the
spaceframe, joined at nodes to aluminium castings and reinforced by
structural panels of aluminium, such as bulkheads, floor and inner wings.
Indications are that while adapted robotic welders will play their usual
role in joining the extrusions and castings, the structural panels will be
adhesive-bonded or mechanically fastened, perhaps both, to the spaceframe,
diminishing the role of multi-welders.
Other companies have been researching intensively the potential for bonding
instead of welding. The UK's Rover Group,formerly BL, and Aluminium Company
of Canada (Alcan), for example, developed jointly a volume manufacturing
process for aluminium-bodied cars which, in the mid-1980s, was originally
intended to become the next Metro.
The system involved the production of aluminium pressings from rolled sheet
and their joining together by a combination of spot welds - but many fewer
than on a conventional steel body - and toughened epoxy resin adhesive. As
Dr David Kewley, Rover's chief engineer, advanced technology and materials,
points out in a study, Towards the Aluminium Car, produced by the Aluminium
Extruders' Association, "it would have been the next Metro, but it was a
hell of a risk to take. We decided we would rather be an excellent second
with the technology than a mediocre first'.
Rover is unlikely now even to be second, having suspended its work on such
structures, as concerns about its privatisation and other preoccupations
changed the course of its history. But Alcan's work with other
manufacturers, including Volvo and General Motors, has continued. Indeed,
the aluminium industry increasingly is arguing that the fundamental auto
industry scene is shifting from one in which the aluminium companies have
had actively to promote their potential, to a demand-pull from the car
makers themselves. 'The auto companies are beating a path to our door",
according to Alcan's chairman, Mr David Morton.
With the Alcoa/Audi project, development of the spaceframe members has
required the creation of thin-wall die-casting techniques, as well as the
development of heat treatable alloys capable of withstanding the stresses
involved in a vehicle frame, including crash-worthiness.
Many obstacles still stand in the way of an early, wholesale substitution of
steel with aluminium in car bodies for the volume market - not least the
initial high cost of the material itself. If they are overcome on a large
scale, it will not necessarily be good news for that part of the
manufacturing industry which traditionally has supplied the dies and other
tooling for the several hundred pressings which typically make up the
monocoque bodies of current steel cars.
One of the attractions of the Alcoa project for Audi is that only about 100
individual parts are needed to make a spaceframe body, meaning fewer dies
and casting and thus sharply reduced tooling costs. Such developments have
prompted a recent study by consultancy group, Brook Hunt Associates, to
forecast that the use of aluminium for body parts will grow by more than
eight times between 1990 and and the end of the decade, to more than 100,000
tones a year. When other aluminium components, such as gearbox casings and
cylinder heads, are taken into account, it expects more than 1m tonnes a
year to be used in cars by 1997-98.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of Vehicle Manufacturing Technology (1): Competition
gets fiercer - Car manufacturers, in the struggle for advantage or survival,
in one of the most harshly competitive activities, are using virtually every
technology. This includes the development of materials, applied robotics and
new energy applications
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE world automotive industry of the 1990s is unique in the demands it
places on the processes of industrial design, development and production and
the technologies which make them possible.
This uniqueness stems not so much from the technological sophistication of
the product - the latest Mercedes 500 is hi-tech but hardly stands
comparison with an Airbus - as its combination with the problems and
complexities of manufacturing in large volumes.
Car plants this year will produce nearly 40m vehicles. Each vehicle
contains, on average, nearly 10,000 individual parts. In addition, the
industry will produce more than 4m commercial vehicles. It is the world's
largest manufacturing activity, and its most multi-faceted.
As part of the manufacturers' struggle for advantage, or survival, in one of
the most harshly competitive activities, the industry subsumes virtually
every technology. This includes the development of materials, applied
robotics and new energy applications.
In the past few years, competition has been added to other environmental and
legislative pressures. Cars and trucks - and there are expected to be more
than 500m on the world's roads by the early 21st century - have become an
enormous environmental problem.
In endeavouring to minimise their environmental impact, the motor industry
is exploring a broad array of actions, for example, vehicle weight-saving in
order to improve fuel economy and alternative energy sources and recycling.
Many of these will bring, or are bringing, change in the processes and
technologies to what has been mainly a steel-based metal-bashing industry.
In the area of vehicle bodies, for example, aluminium and plastic composites
are challenging traditional steels. Both are much lighter than steel.
Neither suffers from steel's propensity to rust.
Audi, Volkswagen's executive car arm, is sufficiently convinced of
aluminium's benefits to have committed its next V8 saloon to be built in
aluminium, using a spaceframe concept in which unstressed aluminium panels
are to be attached, possibly through bonding rather than welding.
If such construction were to be adopted on a wide scale - by no means a
foregone conclusion because of aluminium's high cost - there are
implications right through the manufacturing supply line, heavily impacting
foundries and the demand for traditional dies and stamping and pressing
systems.
The advent of plastic composites for body parts, similarly, is drawing in
new processes and players. Large chemical groups such as Dow and Du Pont are
anxious not to lose the impetus they have gained from projects such as
General Motors' Saturn with its 240,000 cars a year capacity, in which car
bodies are made of thermoplastics hung on a steel skeleton.
The past three or four years has seen a spurt in the manufacturing
technology for such materials. The industry has learned how to make plastics
stampable into body panels and is making rapid strides in reducing the
lengthy cycle times needed to make injection-moulded components - one of the
material's biggest drawbacks.
Such developments are stimulating those engaged in processing more
traditional materials to fight back. Fritz Winter Eisengeiberie, the German
foundries group and one of the world's biggest independent iron castings
suppliers, has introduced a process for casting iron. It was developed by
Professor Lennart Backerud and it is claimed that it reduces the weight of a
casting by 30 per cent and costs by 10 per cent, with no loss of strength.
Pressures are mounting not only to make vehicles lighter and cleaner but
also the manufacturing processes. Nowhere has this been more apparent than
in vehicle paint plants which use tens of millions of gallons annually.
The industry is switching to water-based paints rather than the aromatic
solvent-based materials which have contributed to atmospheric pollution. The
latest generations of car plants endeavour to capture, clean or even recycle
their manufacturing emissions.
Opel's Russelsheim plant captures such emissions and turns them into energy
for the plant. Volkswagen's symbol of manufacturing cleanliness has become
famous: shoals of goldfish swimming in pools of recycled water. Specific
manufacturing technology improvements such as these are being introduced
within a much broader scenario of change, brought about mainly by heightened
competition from the Japanese.
The Japanese industry can bring a model into production in three years or
less, compared with a typical five years or longer for most Western
producers. Even the Japanese have begun to conclude that this might be
overkill and that four years is a more sensible norm.
However, while reaching this conclusion, the Japanese industry has acted to
use the design and engineering abilities it has acquired to broaden its
product spread and probe into an increasing number of specialist niches.
The US industry, first in the firing line of Japanese market share
ambitions, has been enthusiastic in its adoption of simultaneous engineering
techniques to help it fight back.
General Motors, in particular, appears to be reaping significant benefit
from a system which has its origins in Japan. The concept is deceptively
simple. All operating elements of the manufacturer are involved
simultaneously with a new car from first concept through to the first
vehicle coming off the production line.
That might appear to be self-evidently the proper course - but it is not one
that has been followed by Western producers. Instead, the typical procedure
has been to undergo the sequential process of a team designing a vehicle,
then forwarding the concept to the engineering division, where compromises
are made to make driveline equipment fit.
Subsequently, the finance division usually puts pressure on for cheaper
components to be used in some areas, introducing more compromises. As the
finale, the manufacturing division is then likely to point out that the
vehicle is too difficult to make, or that additional investment will be
needed in adapting production lines.
However, none of it would be possible without the wealth of computer-driven
technology. This has allowed the creation of master databases for all a
company's divisions and even outside suppliers to work off simultaneously,
together with the computer-aided design, manufacturing and logistics systems
which lie at the heart of the industry.
As Europe braces for its own era of much-increased competition with Japanese
cars, the simultaneous engineering concept has taken swift root. Indeed, BMW
has created perhaps the largest single research engineering centre in the
European industry in pursuit of simultaneous engineering principles.
Its Fiz centre in Munich, a futuristic maze of towers and multiple
connecting walkways, houses nearly 6,000 engineers, none of whom has to walk
more than 150 metres to talk to a colleague. It allows a first-concept
designer easily to discuss with a production line engineer (the building
houses prototype production lines) the manufacturing practicalities of even
an outline design idea.
Such are the Fiz's advantages, according to Dr Wolfgang Reitzle, head of
research and development at BMW, that it is cutting two years from BMW's
development cycles. The design of the building is based on the concept that,
if physical distances between two designers or engineers are greater than
150 metres, the easy interchange of ideas or discussion of problems is
discouraged.
It represents a recognition by BMW that competitiveness is as much a
function of the proper organisation of human resources as of technology.
Similar thinking lies at the heart of the lean production concept which,
started by Toyota several decades ago, is seen by virtually every large car
maker as the only way of securing the long-term future.
Lean production, identified by a five-year study of the world car industry
by a Massachusetts Institute of Technology team, involves using teams of
multi-skilled workers at all levels of a company's organisation, in concert
with highly flexible, increasingly automated machines to produce lower
volumes of products in greater variety.
The study concluded that with this process Western producers are hoping to
close the production gap with Japan. For example, a US plant takes 25 hours
to assemble a car compared with an average of 13 hours in Japan.
It is not clear what is meant by lean production. Only last month
Mercedes-Benz, for the first time facing real pressure from Japanese
manufacturers, opened a new plant at Rastatt with the claim by Mr Werner
Niefer, chief executive, that it was the most advanced car-making facility
in the world.
He asserts that production and management at Rastatt are lean and capable of
cutting production costs by at least 25 per cent while ensuring quality and
the near-abolition of traditional post-build rectification procedures. The
lean procedures, he insists, are Mercedes' own and owe nothing to Japan.
Rastatt will be watched closely by the industry.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (20): 'De Klerk is clinging to levers
of power' - Mr Nelson Mandela, president of the African National Congress
(ANC), speaks of his concerns and outlines his vision of a new South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT, MICHAEL HOLMAN, PATTI WALDMWIR and PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
What are the most important themes in South Africa today?
Nelson Mandela: The most important development in the country is the
Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa) . . . Problems have arisen
serious enough to destabilise negotiations. There is the question of the
violence which has been raging since 1984 in the course of which more than
13,000 innocent people have been killed. We have believed throughout that
the government had the capacity to put an end to the violence . . . but our
view has been that for one reason or other the government is reluctant to
use its capacity.
That was disturbing enough but it is the involvement of Mr (FW) de Klerk,
the head of government, that has disturbed us most . . . The total pattern
(of the violence) is trying to destabilise the ANC . . . and it seems clear
to us that the idea is to prevent a democratic government dominated by the
ANC.
No doubt De Klerk does want fundamental democratic change, but what he does
not want is to have a democratic government dominated by the ANC. In spite
of the fact that he wants democratic changes, nevertheless he is clinging to
the levers of power . . . which they have enjoyed for the last 44 years.
These two issues threaten the whole negotiating process.
But we are determined that this process should succeed and that is why we
are demanding the immediate installation of an interim government which will
be representative of all national groups. One of the aims of the interim
government would have to be to take over security and it is only then that
we hope it will be possible for us to restrain the enemies which perpetrate
this violence.
What is your concept of power-sharing after the interim period?
NM: We have come out with a very clear policy . . . we call for one person
one vote. We call for a bill of rights . . . we call for an independent
judiciary which will entrench the powers set out in the bill of rights. Even
when a democratic government is installed, no minority group should be
disadvantaged because the constitution is going to be drawn up by a body
which has been established through free and fair elections. We go further to
say that the amendment of the constitution should be done by a two-thirds
majority. We also go further to say that the new parliament should be built
on the principle of proportional representation so that every political
party which gets above a certain percentage of votes will be represented . .
. I think we have done everything which would be expected in a democratic
country.
What we are not prepared to do is to give power to a minority of less than
15 per cent of the population, as the whites are, give them the right to
veto the decisions of a majority taken lawfully in parliament. No country
has ever done that and that is what De Klerk wants. That he cannot get. That
we cannot accept. But we are very concerned that if the first government
should really receive the support of the population not only by virtue of
the fact that the majority will have voted for it, but that it should be
seen to represent everybody, we should inspire confidence among all the
national groups in the country . . . assuming the ANC gets an overall
majority in the forthcoming election, it would be proper to build this
national confidence to offer parties which have lost, a seat in parliament.
Would you extend the question of proportional representation beyond the
national assembly into the executive?
NM: No . . . (but) of course we are going to make sure that the executive is
representative of the national groups in the country. When we say that we
want a government of national unity, we mean it. National unity can only
mean that the institutions of government . . . should be representative of
all groups. But that will be a decision which will be taken (by the
government) not as a result of the constitution.
What will you do about the civil service?
NM: The details of what will be done by a democratic government (will)
depend on the conditions that exist at the time. It suffices to say that we
do not intend to throw people into the streets simply because a democratic
government has been installed. What we are determined to do is to
democratise the civil service to ensure that it is representative of all
groups. This will be done in a humane manner.
We will also look at the fact that the civil service is too big and the
country cannot carry such a service. These questions will be examined very
carefully but in such a way as not to create any dislocation, any turmoil.
What is important is not only to attain victory for democracy, it is to
retain democracy, and that is not going to be very easy. We have to be
absolutely careful as to how and in what manner we will bring about changes
in the civil service.
Should there be a clause in the constitution on affirmative action?
NM: We are suggesting only that we are concerned to put in the constitution
that the economy of the country must be developed in such a way as to
promote the welfare of all population groups and leave the details to be
worked out as we tackle specific problems.
Negotiations seem to be proceeding very slowly . . .
NM: If one takes into account the background of our country the fact that
over two years we have made such progress is to me in itself a miracle . . .
what we are not prepared for is to have experiments on democracy . . . in
this country the simple fact has been and still is today that a party which
polls the most votes is called upon to run the country. There is no reason
why it should change simply because Africans or blacks are on the verge of
having an effective say in any future government.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (21): Something to cheer about -
Sports-mad South Africa has been welcomed back into the fold
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE emergence of South African sport from years of isolation is replete with
irony, not least that the sport which led the way was cricket. After all, if
the start of South Africa's sporting isolation can be put down to a single
event, it was the announcement in 1969, by the then South African prime
minister, Mr B J Vorster, that the England cricket team was not welcome in
South Africa with the coloured cricketer Basil D'Oliviera (ironically, a
South African exile).
Cricket was also responsible for the nadir of the isolation era - the
infamous Gatting rebel tour in 1989 which caused widespread civil unrest.
Again, ironically, it was this tour which galvanised cricket administrators
into grappling with the impact of apartheid in sport, with such success that
few could begrudge them their right to be the first sport re-admitted to
international competition.
The past year has seen events move at a giddy pace. South Africa has been
re-admitted to the international Olympic movement, and will participate in
the Barcelona Olympics, and the national cricket team has been to India, the
West Indies and the World Cup in Australia. Later this year, Australia and
New Zealand will play rugby internationals in South Africa.
Last time South Africa played rugby against New Zealand was in 1981 at Eden
Park in Auckland, a completely surreal affair highlighted by an
anti-apartheid demonstrator repeatedly buzzing the ground in a light
aircraft while flour-bombing the players.
From Eden Park in 1981 to Bridgetown, Barbados, in 1992, where South Africa
played its first test against the West Indies, is a long way. In between was
the era characterised by South Africa's isolation and the slogan 'No normal
sport in an abnormal society'. As punitive measures go, sporting sanctions
were enormously effective. South African sportsmen and women were deprived
of the athlete's ultimate goal, the right to compete against the world's
best.
Whether the sanctions hastened the process of political reform must be
doubtful. However, they have undeniably been enormously important in
pressurising (white) establishment sports administrators into getting their
house in order. Men such as Mr Sam Ramsamy, now head of the National Olympic
Committee of South Africa (Nocsa), who led the drive for sporting isolation,
made the normalisation of sport contingent on a simple equation:
international competition depended, first, upon the achievement of unity
between different, normally racially-biased, administrative bodies in each
sporting code; and, second, the implementation of development programmes
within these codes for uplifting the disadvantaged sector.
Although some sports have done better than others, the overall advance
towards unity has been rapid. Mr Ramsamy comments: 'Progress has been
tremendous from the side of the establishment (white) bodies simply because
they realise they can't get international competition without it.'
After Barcelona, the accent will fall on development. A two-pronged strategy
will be pursued, with the development of an elite, who can provide role
models, being encouraged, as well as a 'sport-for-all' policy which will
eventually provide all children with access to sporting facilities.
Now, however, progress on the sporting front is being hampered by the slow
progress of political negotiations. Thus the thorny question of national
symbols, such as flags and anthems, remains unresolved. Commentators at the
cricket World Cup were encouraged not to refer to the cricketers as the
Springboks, and athletes at Barcelona will not perform under the national
flag. Should they win a medal they will have to listen to Beethoven's 'Ode
to Joy'.
A further irony of the sports unification process has been the dominance of
the ANC and its sporting allies. In spite of white South Africans being
completely sports mad, the government has almost entirely abdicated from the
sporting arena. The sport portfolio in cabinet is tagged on, almost as an
afterthought, to the porfolios of National Education and Environment.
Although there would have been no re-admittance to world sport without the
reform efforts of President F W de Klerk, all subsequent developments have
been the fruits of efforts by non-establishment individuals. On the Olympic
front, this was Mr Ramsamy. But the man who emerged as the absolutely
crucial figure, particularly as regards cricket and rugby, was Mr Steve
Tshwete of the ANC, previously a very senior figure in the armed wing of the
ANC, Umkhonto we Sizwe.
Nobody doubts that without Mr Tshwete's support, South Africa's cricketers
would not yet have left these shores. And the picture of a tearful Mr
Tshwete hugging the South African captain, Kepler Wessels, after the
historic World Cup victory over Australia did more for the ANC's support
among whites than any number of political speeches could achieve.
Moments such as that lend truth to the dewy cliche about sport building
bridges between people. The gap to be traversed, however, remains large.
When South Africa came so close to achieving a hugely improbable victory
over the West Indies, only to crumble on the last morning, white South
Africa went into mourning. The Sowetan, the largest black daily paper,
celebrated, however, the 'Magnificent West Indies victory'.
Still, the time is now much closer when South Africans can watch their sport
without worrying about politics. Already, patriotism has enjoyed an
unexpected comeback. For many South Africans patriotism has always been a
dirty word, full of unhealthy political resonances about being on the side
of the oppressor. The World Cup, for the first time, allowed people to feel
patriotic without being ashamed. It was a liberating and healthy experience,
and it was not only whites who enjoyed it.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (18): Crisis year for farmers -
Agriculture has been hit by possibly the worst drought this century
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASKED whether he thought he would survive the political transition process,
Mr Kraai van Niekerk, the minister of agriculture, answered: 'No.
Agriculture is the most dispensable portfolio.' In any event, he added, he
would take the first opportunity to return to his farm in the northern Cape.
The first comment displays political acumen. The second, many would say, is
almost perverse. Following a decade of inclement conditions and
deteriorating finances, the agricultural sector has now been hit by possibly
the worst drought this century. Many farmers, given the choice, would
happily swap the notional benefits of their lifestyle for the security of
city life. Certainly, there is no stream on to the land. Last year the Land
Bank, the parastatal lending organisation, repossessed 326 farms and could
only resell 70 of them.
To minimise the economic and social impact of the drought, the government
last month announced a R3.8bn rescue package, billed as the 'most
significant rescue bid in the history of South African agriculture'. There
was little alternative but to act in this way. Although comprising only 4.1
per cent of gross domestic product (GDP), the commercial agriculture sector
provides employment for about 1.2m farm workers, or 13 per cent of the
economically-active labour force, who in turn support about 5m dependants.
Given that South Africa already faces severe unemployment, and urbanisation
on a scale which it is manifestly failing to handle, the arguments for
trying to alleviate the crisis in the agricultural sector are clearly
powerful. While the measures taken - effectively a one-off subsidy of R375
per hectare for all crop farmers operating in the 33 disaster drought areas
 -will go a long way towards minimising the social impact of the drought,
the macro-economic implications are inescapable.
The South African Agricultural Union says provisional crop estimates
indicate that only 22.9 per cent of the normal volume of agricultural
production will be achieved in the summer rainfall areas. This varies from
45 per cent in the eastern region to 19 per cent, 18 per cent and 10 per
cent in the northern, central and western parts respectively. Whereas in
January economists were predicting real GDP growth of 2.5 per cent, the
likelihood is that South Africa will have its third successive year of
negative growth.
The impact on the balance of payments will also be significant.
Traditionally South Africa is a net exporter of agricultural products to the
tune of between R1.1bn and R3.7bn a year during the period 1985-90. This
year, though, the country will have to import more than 5m tonnes of maize
and probably 1m tonnes of wheat. The import bill for maize alone is likely
to be R3bn.
The explanation for the agricultural sector's difficulties goes deeper than
sheer malevolence on the part of the gods. Indeed, Mr Van Niekerk has been
brave enough to admit that 'mistakes' by government contributed to the
present malaise. The background is that during the mid-1980s, when there was
a succession of poor crops, the state provided a guarantee to farmer
co-operatives to enable them to provide credit to farmers who would
otherwise have found it difficult to continue. A total of R2.4bn was
involved in this guarantee. Therefore, had the state simply walked away from
farmers in the present drought, they were already committed to the tune of
R2.4bn.
The R3.8bn scheme, spread over four years, effectively allows the state to
buy out of its guarantee scheme. The state's assistance to the farmers has
not been without controversy. Some argue: why only agriculture? Why not, for
example, ailing marginal gold mines? Others argue that, within the
agricultural context, the state is preventing marginal farmers from being
weeded out while hampering better farmers through controls and restrictions.
Mr Van Niekerk has a twofold answer for his critics. First priority, he
says, is to ensure food self-sufficiency. 'The government's aim is to supply
good quality food at a reasonable price. But in the end the availability of
food can only be ensured by the profitability of production for the farmer
and not the consumer price, because if there's no food available, then the
price is irrelevant.'
The second part of his reply is that the drought relief scheme, by removing
state guarantees, 'guides agriculture back to free market principles with
regard to dealing with agricultural debt'. Although the trend in recent
years has been towards making farmers' decisions more market-driven, the
government has clearly adopted a very timid approach to reform in this area.
Asked to what extent government has sought to actually encourage this
process, Mr Van Niekerk replies: 'If government is too prescriptive you run
the risk of failure. It comes back to you. The farmers must decide. I'm not
willing to decide."
There have, however, been some minor successes with the privatisation of
meat inspection, seed inspection, quality inspection of export agricultural
products, the deregulation of dairy regulations, the freer movement of meat
and the abolition of wine quotas.
Mr Van Niekerk accepts that the marketing boards, which still wield
considerable regulatory and price-setting powers in South African
agriculture, especially in the key areas of maize, wheat, milk and meat,
should alter their functions. He is critical of the fact that they not only
formulate policy, but act as agent, too. He believes they should change
function and become purely advisory bodies, with the actual marketing being
left to the farmers, collectively or individually as they see fit. A
successful precedent along these lines already exists in the deciduous fruit
industry.
Deciduous fruit, together with citrus, is one of the few bright spots on the
agricultural scene at the moment. One reason for this is that being situated
in the winter rainfall areas of the western Cape and eastern Transvaal,
these industries have escaped the drought. They also export large portions
of their crop and have profited considerably from the end of the sanctions
era.
Although the drought has dominated the policy agenda for the past six
months, agriculture has not been left behind in the dash for the new South
Africa. Moves are under way to rationalise the existing 14 agriculture
departments into one, and increasing attention is being given to the
question of how to assist black subsistence farmers to progress to the point
where they become viable commercial farmers.
If the government really wanted to be useful, though, it would address the
question of profitability. Real farming profits fell at an average 5.5 per
cent per annum over the period 1980-1991. Unless that trend can be arrested,
one must assume that future generations will prefer to import their food and
play golf on the land instead.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (19): Out of the cold into the sun -
The call of the wild in a tourist's paradise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I do not believe there are many more impressive sights than a city man's
first glimpse of a live, maned lion loose on a plain in a strange country.
Robert Ruark
FOLLOWING a recent visit to Sabi Sabi, one of the luxury game lodges in the
Eastern Transvaal, I can unequivocally endorse the comments of the famous
American hunter and novelist. The spectacle of two lions roaring at each
other, literally yards away from our open Jeep, was one of such primal power
and immediacy as to defy adequate description.
Likewise, the sight of a leopard cleaning her two cubs in a sandy river bed
and, later, the massive, tank-like menace of the white rhino. But it is not
only the big animals which constitute the appeal of the bush. The sights,
sounds and smells are so distinctive, and the locations so remote, as to
allow for the sort of relaxation not easily found elsewhere.
Robert Ruark would not have been familiar with the modern phrase
'eco-tourism', but those who now make heavy play of the 'eco' prefix are
essentially making a similar appeal about the call of the wild in an age
when the quality of city life is widely perceived as deteriorating. Already
80 per cent of visitors to South Africa come to see its fauna and flora.
Mr Clem Sunter, South Africa's leading scenario guru, has predicted that
conservation is the area where the smart money is heading and he is
enthusiastically supported by people such as Mr Dave Varty who is associated
with the Londolozi and Phinda eco-tourism developments. Mr Varty comments:
'We see eco-tourism as being the next major growth industry in South
Africa.' The reasoning is simple: wildlife is a finite resource, for which
there is an increasing tourism demand.
It is also an area, of course, in which South Africa has a competitive
advantage. Only a handful of other countries in Africa can offer a similar
product, and South Africans believe they offer a more sophisticated wildlife
product than East Africa and a better balanced destination overall. In
support of his claim, Mr Varty cites the high occupancy rates achieved by
places such as Sabi Sabi, Londolozi and Mala Mala through the sanctions
period.
Although eco-tourism is seen as probably South Africa's main marketing
feature, enthusiasm in the tourism industry is more widely based. Mr Pieter
van Hoven, chairman of the South African Tourism Board (Satour), notes:
'We've come out of the cold era into the sun. For many years we had to deal
with South Africa's moral unacceptability as a tourism destination. Now all
this has changed. Effectively the country can market itself on equal terms
with other competing destinations.'
South Africa markets itself, not unreasonably, as 'a world in one country'.
From game parks in the east, to the Drakensberg mountains in Natal and fine
beaches along the coast, there is a lot of variety to offer the tourist.
Aside from intrinsic merits, however, Mr van Hoven believes the tourism
industry has a good future merely in catch-up terms. He notes that the
industry at present only constitutes about 0.7 per cent of gross domestic
product, compared to a world average of about 10 per cent.
In 1990, South Africa attracted about 1m visitors, making it the fourth most
popular destination in Africa behind Tunisia, Morocco and Algeria, all
short-haul destinations. Mr Org Marais, minister of tourism, talks in terms
of South Africa attracting 3m foreign visitors by 2000.
Mr Van Hoven says any post-apartheid benefit in 1991 was obscured by the
detrimental impact of the Gulf War. He says, however, that for the first
quarter of 1992 quite a few European markets showed growth of 45-47 per cent
compared to 1990 and he forecasts overall growth of 30 per cent in foreign
visitors for 1992.
The government has recently shown a new-found enthusiasm for the economic
potential of tourism. A White Paper in May outlined a policy for assisting
the industry, including financial assistance for new tourist accommodation
projects and a commitment to deregulate the industry to assist the private
sector.
A recent liberalisation of international aviation policy should also make
South Africa a considerably cheaper destination to fly to. Last year saw 16
international airlines start new scheduled flights to South Africa.
There is not yet much indication of additional investment from the private
sector, because there is considerable spare capacity following a few lean
years in the hotel industry. That said, industry consensus is that up to
five foreign hotel groups are likely soon to announce investments.
In a category of its own is the R730m Lost City project being developed at
Sun City by Mr Sol Kerzner. For the faint-hearted worrying about whether the
country has a future, there could be no greater gesture of faith.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (17): Daunting burden of development
 -Tough social problems loom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE ALL, whites and blacks, think we're entitled to Swedish social security,
but with Polish GDP. It won't work like that,' says Mr John Kane-Berman,
director of the South African Institute of Race Relations, highlighting the
most daunting problem of the post-apartheid era: how to meet the enormous
economic expectations raised by the prospect of black rule.
For any new government will immediately face one grim truth: that South
Africa simply does not have the resources to raise black living standards
overnight to white levels, and there is no explosion of economic growth on
the horizon to meet the country's huge development needs.
South Africa's under-educated population lacks the skills needed for
economic revolution along Far Eastern lines. And over the next generation,
the sheer weight of numbers will depress efforts at economic upliftment: by
2010, South Africa's 1980 population of 29.1m will have nearly doubled to
59.7m, according to the Urban Foundation, a business-funded policy
institute.
It is far from clear that the post-apartheid economy will be up to the task
of housing, educating and employing nearly 60m people. Black South Africans
may well find that life remains a struggle.
The first post-apartheid government will inherit a country where, in the
words of the authoritative Second Carnegie Inquiry into Poverty and
Development in Southern Africa, published in 1989, 'poverty is deep and
widespread and . . . the degree of inequality is as great as in any other
country in the world.' For a nation so advanced - the World Bank classifies
it as an upper middle-income developing country - the extent of poverty is
striking.
The charity Operation Hunger feeds 1.8m people daily, victims of the
three-year recession and this year's catastrophic drought. In 1989, 40 per
cent of the population (excluding the nominally independent homelands where
poverty is rife) is estimated to have lived below the so-called 'minimum
living level' or poverty line. A recent IMF report* notes that in terms of
social indicators such as life expectancy and infant mortality 'black South
Africa has done at best only moderately better than its neighbours despite
its proximity to Africa's most dynamic economy'.
The gap between white and black incomes further emphasises black
deprivation: according to the Development Bank of Southern Africa, though
black incomes have risen more than white incomes in recent years, the white
share of total personal income was 54 per cent in 1988 (whites are 13 per
cent of the population) while blacks representing nearly 80 per cent of the
population had a 36 per cent share.
Apartheid has ensured that state spending on social services is similarly
skewed. According to the IMF, government spent R4,087 per capita educating
whites in 1990, and only R907 on blacks, R2,406 for coloureds and R3,055 for
Asians. Pensions, which are a principal source of income for the poorest
South Africans, are also unequal: whites get a R345 monthly payment, blacks
R293. Health spending is also distorted. And while whites are all at least
decently housed - South African cities boast some of the world's most
luxurious suburbs on earth - over more than 7m non-whites live in informal
urban dwellings such as shacks.
Racial disparities in social spending have narrowed substantially in recent
years, and the government has devoted an extra R3bn of extra-budgetary funds
for special education and housing projects. But the cost of introducing per
capita parity between races would be extremely high. The IMF report states:
'Equalising spending levels at the present white level would result in an
overall level of social spending dramatically beyond the capacity of the
budget.'
It notes that overall spending on education and health (though not on
pensions) is already high in relation to GDP: indeed, education spending, as
a share of the budget and of GDP, substantially exceeded not only that of
middle-income countries, but also industrial nations.
Abolishing the senseless duplications of apartheid would generate some
savings: the new South Africa will not need 15 racially-based departments of
finance, 15 education departments and 14 health ministries, complete with
Mercedes-driving ministers in each one. But the cost of reincorporation is
likely to exceed any savings: to raise per capita socio-economic spending on
homeland blacks to the level which prevails in the Republic would mean a 38
per cent overall increase. And given that independence governments elsewhere
in Africa have tended to increase bureaucracy rather than reduce it, there
seems little chance that bloated homeland civil services or central
government will be streamlined.
The IMF report concludes: 'The scope for further compressing non-social
spending (eg defence) . . . is limited and therefore implies that social
expenditures will need to be re-ordered if the budget is to attend to the
needs of the least privileged groups of society without significant resort
to deficit financing or to higher taxes.' What this means in practice,
according to minister of (black) education and training, Sam de Beer, is
that if South Africa continues to spend 6 per cent of GDP on education
(assuming 3 per cent overall economic growth and a 1:32 pupil/teacher
ratio), government will be able to finance only seven years of compulsory
education by 2000.
The inevitable conclusion is the one drawn by the late Mr Simon Brand,
formerly Development Bank chairman: 'We don't have the resources for the
kind of welfare state we have been running for whites.'
Substantially increasing taxes to fund greater social spending on blacks
would be counter-productive, the IMF argues: 'The tax burden on the white
community appears to be relatively high even by industrial country
standards. This would argue against raising tax rates in South Africa and
running the risk of heightening disincentive effects.'
The IMF concludes: 'Redistribution policies will need to be firmly supported
by growth-orientated policies if the social spending gap is to be
effectively bridged.'
For without economic growth, very little progress can be made toward a more
economically just society.
Yet sustaining growth at the 3.5 per cent required for what the IMF calls a
'meaningful increase in living standards' - during a period of great
political and social turmoil - could well prove a tall order.* Economic

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (16): Plans to redraw map - Regional
development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'IN THE 1970s, it was a fantastic offer to establish here,' says Mr Hermann
Dedekind, manager of Springbok Clothing, one of the tenants of the Babelegi
industrial estate in the nominally independent black homeland of
Bophuthatswana.
'But now you really wonder if it's worth it to come here. If it hadn't been
for the huge incentives of the 1970s, we wouldn't have come,' he concludes,
passing judgment on the policy of industrial decentralisation which was a
cornerstone of apartheid, and one of its most costly legacies.
For the aim of apartheid - euphemistically known as 'separate development' -
was to remove all blacks from South Africa to designated black 'homelands'
where they would pursue their own separate tribal nationhood. But
apartheid's planners knew that blacks would not remain segregated in the
homelands without jobs; so they spent billions of rands to persuade white
businesses to set up, either in the homelands or on their borders, to help
develop them into viable economic units. The idea was to give the homelands
an economic as well as political rationale for existence.
Now the sinister political motive which spurred industrial decentralisation
has been abandoned, but the problem of developing remote areas which are
home to half the black population remains as acute as ever - perhaps more
so, as the African National Congress (ANC) and the government are committed
to helping those most disadvantaged under apartheid.
'Forty per cent of our people reside in overcrowded and underdeveloped rural
slums,' says a recent ANC document on regional policy. 'They will, along
with all their compatriots, be important voices in the land . . . Their
demand for roads, electricity, water, rural extension services, schooling,
clinics, cinemas, swimming pools and running tracks will be strong.'
And as both parties favour a strong regional bias to the constitution -
Pretoria wants a federal constitution, while the ANC favours a unitary state
with significant regional autonomy - the issue of regional development will
remain a vexed one. The government has already proposed redrawing the map of
South Africa to include nine development regions, rather than the present
four provinces. The ANC largely agrees, though it proposes a tenth region.
Uncontrolled urbanisation could well frighten a new government into making
decentralised development a priority. For South African cities are already
struggling - and in most cases failing - to provide accommodation and jobs
for millions of immigrants from the rural areas. By 2010, the Urban
Foundation, a business-funded think tank, believes black urbanisation will
reach 68 per cent, adding 14m to the urban total. Any new government may
well be tempted to try to stem this flow, which would overwhelm urban
infrastructure, by investing in development away from the main urban
centres.
Indeed, in a recent document the ANC says its aim is to promote 'a more
balanced pattern of industrialisation capable of overcoming the current
acute over-concentration of economic activity in certain urban areas'.
But as the National party can tell them, this is dangerous ground. According
to a government study published by the Development Bank of Southern Africa
in 1990, the so-called Regional Industrial Development Programme was costly,
inefficient, and failed to stimulate 'self-sustaining growth and coherent
regional development'. The programme involved a range of extremely lucrative
incentives to attract industry to remote regions, or to areas on the edge of
existing metropolises - but always in or next to a homeland. The incentives
included transport rebates, subsidised power, housing loans, provision of
infrastructure, loans for capital requirements, interest rate subsidies, and
a cash incentive in some cases equal to 80 per cent of the wage bill.
The Development Bank study found that the number of jobs created was
'relatively insignificant', that 74 per cent of firms which benefited from
the incentives were unprofitable, and that the system was subject to
widespread abuse.
The Urban Foundation, in a separate report, concluded that it cost three to
four 3-4 times as much to create one job under the programme as in the
cities.
Last year, government reacted to these criticisms by scaling down the
programme, and introducing much more modest market-related incentives. But
the cost of the failed policy will remain a drain on the budget for years to
come: R764m is budgeted this year for continuing payments under the old
scheme (which will decline over time but remain high for years to come); and
the new scheme is budgeted to cost up to R500m a year.
The risk is that the ANC, if it controlled the government, might also be
tempted to adopt an interventionist industrial strategy which could prove
equally unsuccessful. For the Urban Foundation's conclusion is that the
industrial decentralisation scheme did not fail simply because of its
dubious political motivation, but because such a strategy is fundamentally
flawed.
'The international evidence suggests that the best policies for dealing with
such problems are to re-organise the way in which the cities are run rather
than attempt to stop their growth,' the Foundation suggests. It advocates a
regional policy based on exploiting the comparative advantages of regions in
all economic sectors - not just industry, but tourism, agriculture and
especially services - coupled with direct targeting of assistance to the
poor.
So while negotiations will eventually solve the political problem of the
homelands - most will be re-incorporated, though Bophuthatswana may seek
autonomy in a federal South Africa - the problem of regional disparities in
development will not go away. If regional boundaries were re-drawn according
to the ANC's plans, the new Border region, taking in the homelands of
Transkei and Ciskei, would still have 10.6 per cent of the population but
generate only 1.9 per cent of GDP; and the Northern Transvaal region, with
11.5 per cent of the population, would contribute only 3 per cent of GDP.
Any new government must somehow improve the appalling living standards in
these areas, or risk a mass population influx to the cities.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (14): Hopes for psychological boost -
The potential for foreign investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YEARS of international isolation have left a deep scar on the psyche of
white South Africa, reflected in a desperate desire to be fully
re-integrated into the community of nations.
The international travels of President F W de Klerk and the national cricket
team's reacceptance into world cricket have given satisfaction. The acid
test, however, lies at home. South Africans need to see three things to let
them know all is well again: foreign tourists, foreign sportsmen and foreign
investors. A plethora of national carriers at Jan Smuts airport and visits
later this year from the All Blacks and the Wallabies offer reasonable
comfort on the first two counts. Of foreign money, however, there is little
sign.
The reasons for this are not hard to find, nor are they particularly
ominous. The issue, however, is not one of economic need; South Africa is
not so much short of money as it is of investment opportunities that inspire
confidence. The problem, rather, is psychological: foreign investment is
sought as the imprimatur that the outside world believes South Africa has a
reasonable future. Without it, South Africans are prone to believe that
clear-thinking outsiders have seen the future, and they do not like what
they see.
Since February 1990, there has been little flow of capital into the country.
Indeed, there has been a net outflow of foreign money from the capital
markets, albeit at a progressively slower rate in recent years. In 1991, net
equity sales by foreigners amounted to R4.1bn, while net purchases of gilts
amounted to R2bn.
In terms of direct investment, it is instructive to look separately at South
Africa's four main trading partners: Germany, UK, Japan and US. The chances
of seeing any large headline investments from either of the UK or Germany is
very small for the simple reason that most large companies from these
countries are already invested in South Africa. Mercedes-Benz, Volkswagen,
BMW, Hoechst, Bayer, Siemens - they were all here before sanctions and they
never left. Likewise with BP, Shell, GEC, Lonhro, RTZ, Unilever and others.
Most of these companies, naturally, are continuing to invest in their
operations here. Mr Peter Bacon, the British commercial consul, comments:
'Having stuck it out through all the political problems and the economic
recession, they are determined to stay and reap the benefits.'
The US and Japan offer most scope for new entrants to the country. Although
the six main Japanese trading houses have offices here, and companies such
as Nissan, Toyota and Panasonic are present, albeit in a local guise,
Japanese companies were banned from investing in South Africa from 1968
until recently, and hence are under-represented. The US position is
different; many companies were here, but about two-thirds left during the
sanctions period. Mr Don Steinberg, counsellor for economic and commercial
affairs at the US Embassy, notes that in 1984/5 there were about 360 US
companies in South Africa, with a total investment of about Dollars 2.7bn.
This has now dropped to 110 companies with investments worth about Dollars
900m.
Mr Steinberg reports a 'dramatic increase in interest in South Africa. My
visitors' list looks like a list of the Fortune 500. This is too important a
market not to find out what is going on'. Indeed, South Africa remains by
far the largest site of US investment in sub-Saharan Africa, being home to
about half of all US non-oil investment in the area.
Mr Steinberg says that US investors are not, as many suppose, taking a
'wait-and-see' attitude. He says that there are four to five companies on
the verge of announcing 'major new deals' in South Africa. They are merely
waiting for some trigger political event, such as an interim government or
an ANC welcome to foreign investors, before going ahead. The names most
often mentioned in the Press are Pepsi, Heinz, Sara Lee and Apple.
Mr Steinberg cites five main areas where US investors have shown an
interest:
Black consumer market - cosmetics, appliances, food franchising.
Electrification projects are expected to open up vast consumer markets, as
is the rising income levels of employed blacks;
South Africa as an export platform into the region, which was previously
serviced by other subsidiaries;
Involvement of US contractors in regional projects where South Africa is
likely to be the importer of the final good or supplier of capital and
expertise;
Socio-economic spending in South Africa, which should have spin-offs in
areas such as health and education equipment; and
Investment by existing companies.
Although the US is the most likely source of a 'headline' investment in
South Africa, other countries are certainly not standing still. Some of the
existing German companies are spending heavily, with Mercedes-Benz and BMW
engaged with capital expenditure programmes of R500m and R300m respectively.
There has also been a string of high profile visitors from Germany including
the minister of economic affairs, the agricultural, economic and transport
committees of the Bundestag, various deputy ministers and numerous
individual politicians.
Likewise, Mr Bacon reports a fourfold to fivefold increase in the number of
business visitors and market information inquiries compared to two years
ago. Last year also saw about 10 large, officially-funded British trade
missions to South Africa. Mr Bacon estimates that about 35 per cent, or
Pounds 2bn, of foreign investment in South Africa is British. He notes that
in terms of profits and dividends, South Africa is the UK's seventh largest
foreign earner.
South Africans dream optimistically about being swamped by waves of Japanese
investment. The truth is likely to be more mundane. Mr Shuji Okita,
president of the newly-formed Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industries in
South Africa, says that although Japanese investors believe South Africa has
a lot of potential, they are not in a hurry and it will take time for them
to develop their investments. He believes they are more likely, in the first
instance, to seek joint ventures with well-established local companies than
to invest directly.
Mr Bacon endorses this view suggesting the logical order for development is
that companies are first likely to appoint distributors for their products.
If this goes well they will consider manufacturing under licence, or some
sort of joint venture, before taking the route of setting up their own
operation.
From the foreign investor's perspective, there is clearly ample reason for
caution. There remains a high degree of political uncertainty and the
economic policies of a future government are also unclear. Add to this a
familiar list of sins - high inflation, high tax, low labour productivity
and the risk of a depreciating currency - and one has a fairly powerful list
of disincentives. South Africa also has many powerful and well-established
companies which are likely to give any foreign competitor a torrid time.
Finally, South African companies have not exactly been falling over
themselves to invest in new capacity. There are no grounds for expecting
foreigners to be any different.
The flip-side is obvious: the market has enormous potential. It promises
also to be very profitable. Mr Steinberg says that in 1991 the US investment
of Dollars 900m earned profits of Dollars 126m. There are not many countries
offering that sort of return.
From South Africa's point of view, foreign investment will be a bonus rather
than a necessity. The main benefits are likely to flow in terms of enhancing
competition and allowing technology transfer, rather than in terms of sheer
volume of capital flows. Even here, the flows would not have to be
particularly large to make an important difference.
For the time being, though, investment trends are being obscured by the
underlying growth environment. With South Africa likely in 1992 to record
its third successive year of negative growth, investors can hardly be blamed
for holding off until there are some signs of growth returning to the
economy.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (15): New market beckons for banks -
Complicated merger streamlines financial services sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African financial services sector is in healthier shape than it
was a year ago, and the man most responsible for this is Mr Piet Badenhorst,
the formidable chief executive of Amalgamated Banks of South Africa (Absa).
Driven by a healthy ego and massive determination, he is a feared and
respected figure in the banking community. Last year, he was the driving
force behind the complicated merger which brought the United Building
Society (UBS), Volkskas, Allied and part of the Sage group together to form
Absa. This year he took the process a stage further by swallowing up
Bankorp, the weakest of the big five banks in South Africa, in the process
making Absa by far the largest bank in the country in terms of assets (the
Standard Bank group remains largest by market capitalisation).
Absa have a lot of digesting to do, and not all of it will be pleasant.
'Merger business is hell on wheels', in Mr Badenhorst's own graphic phrase.
Apart from having to effect a very high number of retrenchments, Absa also
have to come to terms with the rotten apples which constitute part of
Bankorp's inheritance. As one senior banker notes: 'The last bite of the
cherry may not be so sweet as the first."
While Absa, for some time yet, will remain preoccupied with putting its own
house in order, the impacts of the shake-up in the sector promise to be
far-reaching. Mr Badenhorst believes the formation of Absa will have two
main effects: 'maverick marketing', the product of too many institutions
competing for the same business, and epitomised by 'ridiculous rates of
interest being paid and credit being offered without proper screening', will
cease with four institutions now under the same umbrella. Second, with less
competition for employees, terms of employment will become more realistic
as, in Mr Badenhorst's words, the 'artificial scarcity of skills'
disappears. 'The employment market is shifting to the employer,' he says.
The significance of the Absa merger is that the operational savings are
large enough to give the group a fundamental advantage in terms of providing
a low-cost banking service. South Africa has a very sophisticated financial
services sector, but it is very much oriented towards the needs of the
white, essentially First World, community. The challenge of the future is to
address the needs of the developing market - largely black, and Third World
in nature.
Mr Louis Shill, chairman of the Sage group and also chairman of the Life
Offices Association (LOA), believes that the challenge facing all providers
of financial services in South Africa is to 'get down our unit costs to
provide mass market products'. The challenge to be overcome is that it is
very difficult to be profitable with below-average sized products, whether
they be bank accounts or life policies.
Mr Shill believes that addressing the needs of the new market will require
new structures. 'We can't take our company that is aimed at the very upper
end of the market and adapt it to a completely different market. There's a
world of difference between Harrods and Pick 'n Pay (a South African
supermarket), though they both supply food.' New products will also be
required and intensive education of staff and clients. Mr Shill notes, for
example, that at the lower end of the market, life policies are primarily
seen as savings devices, and it is not always appreciated that the money is
not available on call.
At the moment, addressing the needs of the black market tends to take the
form of the large groups setting up satellite operations, such as Liberty's
Charter Life and Southern's African Life, in the insurance field, and First
National Bank's Future Bank initiative. Mr Badenhorst, however, argues that
the process must go one stage further. He says there is a perception and a
need in the black community that they need their own institutions. He
envisages these developing, probably with the assistance of existing banks,
initially at the lower end of the housing finance spectrum.
Although the jockeying for position in the developing market is driven by a
keen sense of where new business is going to come from, it goes further than
this. Conrad Strauss, chairman of the Standard Bank group, comments: 'The
conflict between poverty and democracy is South Africa's greatest dilemma.
If we want to survive in a democratic society we First World institutions
must get involved.' He notes that the commercial banks play more of a role
in the urban areas where their activities are centred. Addressing the
financial and developmental needs of the rural communities is a burden, he
suggests, which will have to be carried more by parastatal bodies.
Other than addressing the developing market, the main strategic challenge
facing the local banking industry is their re-integration into the world
community. On the one hand, this involves setting up offices abroad. Local
banks are anxious to 'follow the flag' and set up offices abroad so they can
provide services, primarily trade finance and foreign exchange advice.
On the other hand, banks are facing the prospect of foreign competition on
the home front. The areas where this is most likely to come is in the
'blue-chip' corporate market and project finance. Foreign banks can set up
representative offices, unrestrained by local capital requirements, and
offer off-shore credit lines at lower rates than local banks. Their
experience in project finance will probably also allow them to obtain a
share of the business if significant capital projects such as the Columbus
stainless steel venture get the go-ahead. Foreign banks will not attempt to
compete with high-street banks and local merchant banks are also considered
to have a strong hold on mergers and acquisitions business.
The main day-to-day challenge for the banks is maintaining profitability in
an inflationary environment. Although the impact of a protracted recession
is evident in the sharply higher provisions for bad debts at the large
banks, these have been more than offset by the comfortable interest margins
of about 4 per cent that are being enjoyed. Recent results from the Standard
Bank group, First National Bank and Nedcor saw earnings per share rise by 20
per cent in the case of the first two and 13 per cent in the case of Nedcor.
Although all the banks are anxious to put assets on their books, demand for
credit is low and banks themselves are lending very selectively.
South Africa's main banks are all adequately capitalised, though it is
difficult to maintain this position through retentions alone given the high
inflation rate. This explains Standard's offering of a scrip dividend option
and the recent rights offer by First National Bank, taking advantage of a
favourable market rating.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (12): Hopes for a quick future -
Corporate South Africa is holding up well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST South African businessmen believe business will flourish in the new
South Africa because the operating environment cannot possibly be worse than
that of the 80s. But, as Mr Meyer Kahn, chairman of South African Breweries,
has commented, the quicker the future comes, the better.
He has good reason for saying so. South Africa's corporate sector is under
considerable pressure from the effects of a three-year recession.
Calculations from the Reserve Bank's quarterly bulletin reveal that
operating profits of the corporate sector, as a percentage of the fixed
capital stock of private businesses, declined from 12.5 per cent in 1985 to
9.4 per cent in 1989 and 8.9 per cent in 1991.
According to the Reserve Bank, manufacturing output, which started to
decline in 1990, decreased at an annualised rate of 4 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1991. Real value added by the manufacturing sector dropped by 2.5
per cent in 1991. Percentage utilisation of manufacturing capacity reached a
new low of 80.4 per cent in the third quarter of 1991.
An indication of hardship on the ground is the 41 per cent increase in
company and close corporation liquidations for the first quarter. Cumulative
motor vehicle sales, a useful indicator of economic activity, were 11.4 per
cent down for the first four months of 1992 compared to 1991.
Although conditions are difficult, corporate South Africa seems to be
holding up reasonably well. A survey by the Financial Mail of 160 leading
industrial and commercial companies which reported in the second half of
1991, showed overall growth in earnings per share of 7.3 per cent, compared
to negative 0.4 per cent growth for the same period in 1990. This was
achieved in spite of lower turnover growth - at 13.7 per cent, below
inflation - and shrinking margins. Interest cover was an average 5.1 times,
suggesting balance sheets remained in fair shape.
Mr Charles Booth, research director at stockbrokers J D Anderson, says
balance sheets are in better shape than at the bottom of the previous cycle
when interest rates were higher and many companies suffered large foreign
exchange losses. Companies learned their lesson then and this time kept
their gearing down.
A number of blue-chip companies, both fixed-investment and
consumer-oriented, reported a decline in earnings during the first quarter.
Mr Booth believes, however, that recent results, notably respective
increases in earnings of 10 and 15 per cent from South African Breweries and
Barlow Rand, the country's two industrial heavyweights, suggest that an
upturn has begun. The fact that the performances of these companies was not
worse, in spite of the extremely difficult trading conditions, is also a
measure of the market domination that some of the large companies are able
to exert within a small market.
If the upturn has begun, the question is whether it will replicate past
upturns in which earnings growth of 20-30 per cent in the first year was
normal. Mr Booth argues that the present upturn is likely to be more subdued
on the grounds that there seems little prospect of a rise in commodity
prices, particularly gold, which have in the past helped fuel economic
growth in South Africa.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (11): Back in the global fast lane -
Post-sanctions trading partners now focus on subsidies and tariffs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH

<TEXT>
THE PAST two years have seen South Africa's re-integration into the
mainstream of world trade proceed at a dizzy pace. The list of inward- and
outward-bound trade missions is endless and civil servants who used only to
dream of international visitors now complain at their frequency.
Perhaps the best measure of the speed of the whole process is that South
Africa has already reached the stage where the privileges of access have to
be balanced by the duties of conforming to international trading norms.
During the sanctions era the country's political laws attracted attention. A
signal measure of progress is that South Africa's trading partners are now
starting to focus on such relatively banal matters as trade subsidies and
tariff policy.
Although some countries and organisations, and states and municipalities in
the case of the US, still maintain sanctions, that era, for all practical
purposes, is over. The repeal of the Comprehensive Anti-Apartheid Act (CAAA)
last July in the US was the main domino to fall. The other important
developments were President F W de Klerk's visit to Nigeria in April,
effectively signalling South Africa's full acceptance into Africa, and the
easing of attitudes by the Scandinavians, the most uncompromising in their
anti-apartheid stance.
Although the great flurry of business and political visitors testifies to
the changed position, trade figures are less startling due mainly to the
depressed state of the world economy which has dampened export
opportunities, thus preventing the emergence of any obvious sanctions
dividend. The value of South Africa's merchandise exports grew by 8.5 per
cent in 1991, while their volume rose by 3.5 per cent.
While much, correctly, is said about the potential of African markets for
South Africa, its main trading partners remain the world's largest economies
 -Germany, Japan, the US, the UK and Italy. The pattern in all cases is
familiar: South Africa exports commodities to these countries, often of a
strategic nature - gold, coal, vanadium, platinum, ferrochrome - and imports
manufactured goods. Trade with these countries dwarfs trade with Africa
which was estimated at R10bn in 1991. South Africa's total visible trade in
1991 was R114bn.
Deepening its exposure in these existing markets will, however, increasingly
go hand-in-hand with entry into new markets where incremental growth
opportunities lie. The opening up of new markets coincides with a shift in
the composition of South Africa's exports. The strategic nature of many of
South Africa's exports meant that they were largely untouched by sanctions.
The growth opportunities are in those areas where South Africa has not
traditionally exported - manufactured goods, and increasingly services,
especially to Africa, but also to East and Central Europe and to the Far
East. A high proportion of South Africa's manufactured exports are sold to
African countries and South African exports to Africa grew by 40 per cent in
1989 and 22 per cent in 1991.
This trend is already evident in the trade figures. Export of manufactured
goods increased by 21 per cent in 1991, following a 19.5 per cent increase
in 1990. The period 1987-1991 saw manufactured goods as a percentage of
total exports increase to 18.5 per cent from 13.5 per cent. The fact that
this performance correlates closely with world economic growth over the same
period casts doubt on the extent to which trade sanctions really affected
South Africa.
This judgment is endorsed, at least in the case of the US, by Mr Don
Steinberg, counsellor for economic and commercial affairs at the US Embassy.
He notes that the CAAA only applied in areas that were relatively
insignificant in value terms, such as textiles and fruit. Last year
bilateral trade between South Africa and the US was Dollars 3.8bn,
consisting of Dollars 2.1bn US exports and Dollars 1.7bn South African
exports.
Mr Steinberg points out that, notwithstanding sanctions, South Africa
accounts for almost half of all US exports to sub-Saharan Africa and a
similar portion of all non-oil imports from Africa by the US. It can
reasonably be assumed that the pattern is similar for South Africa's other
main trading partners. The year 1990's figures of visible trade show South
Africa's main trading partner was Germany, with trade of Dollars 4.9bn,
while the US, Japan, Italy and UK were all in the Dollars 3.5-Dollars 3.9bn
bracket.
Two major disadvantages which confront South Africa as a trading nation is
that it does not belong to any trading bloc and, according to Mr Wim Holtes,
chief executive of the South African Foreign Trade Organisation, 88 per cent
of its exports are long-distance. Mr Derek Keys, the minister of trade and
industry, has said he considers it a priority to achieve some sort of trade
agreement with the European Community. The few trade agreements are with
countries in the region and countries in East and Central Europe which, in
the post-Communist era, were as desperate for friends as was South Africa.
It is clearly also in South Africa's interests to develop its neighbouring
market. Three problems, however, prevent any quick realisation of this
ambition: lack of finance to pay for goods on the part of South Africa's
neighbours; lack of suitable goods in those countries which South Africa
wants to buy; and the problem of 'giantism' - South Africa being perceived
as an imperialist power intent on dominating its neighbours.
South Africa's return to the international fold, and its own economic needs,
are also focusing attention on the country's tariff structure. The external
catalyst comes in the form of the Uruguay Round of GATT. South Africa has
made an offer which, when implemented, will involve a gradual reduction in
ad valorem duties to a maximum of 30 per cent, while the number of tariff
lines bound against increase will rise by 42 per cent to 57 per cent of the
total 11,000-12,000 tariff lines. Mr Gerhard Breyl, deputy director-general
of the department of trade and industry, says South Africa's ability to
effect more dramatic reductions is limited by its membership of the South
African Customs Union (South Africa, Botswana, Lesotho, Namibia and
Swaziland) whose other members want high tariffs to protect infant
industries.
The internal impetus for tariff reform is the government's acceptance of the
need to shift the economy from an inward to an outward orientation to boost
growth. The Industrial Development Corporation (IDC) produced a report in
1990 which recommended that import duties be lowered substantially, but in
tandem with other steps by government, such as a lowering of income tax,
reduction of the import surcharge and lower inflation and interest rates,
which would give local companies a fair chance of competing in international
markets. Revenue constraints on government, however, have prevented it from
delivering the fiscal side of this deal, and this clearly impacts on the
pace at which tariffs can be reduced.
Though Mr Keys talks of a 'strongish anti-subsidy feeling in government',
free market critics are scathing of the government's unwillingness to go the
Argentine route and effect overnight, drastic tariff reductions. Mindful,
however, of unemployment already at high levels, the government is not
prepared to engage in disruptive tariff reduction that risks aggravating
this problem. Mr Keys says such a fundamental shift in industrial
orientation takes time and requires training programmes and a social
security net which South Africa lacks. 'It just doesn't seem responsible to
me' (a wholesale tariff reduction).
Mr Keys argues that South Africa is anyway not a high tariff country. He
says tariffs are generally low, with high peaks in certain areas where
formula duties, which rise automatically as the price of the import rises,
apply. He says the revenue raised from tariffs on imports is about 6 per
cent of their total value.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (13): New leader for a new era -
Stock Exchange
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH

<TEXT>
THE political reform process in South Africa has galvanised many
organisations into a fundamental reassessment of their role, often with the
view that new goals necessarily require new structures. But as one senior
banker put it: 'You do not need new horses in South Africa. You need new
jockeys.'
The Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) has experienced just such a change
recently with Mr Roy Andersen taking over in May as president of the JSE
from Mr Tony Norton. Much of Mr Norton's five-year tenure was occupied with
systems and structures - improving the general functioning of South Africa's
capital markets. Mr Andersen has already made clear that with the structures
in place, it is now a question of ensuring that these match the needs of the
emerging South Africa.
He is well aware that many of South Africa's leading black politicians see
the JSE as little more than a privileged, white man's casino whose functions
are wholly unrelated to the needs of the mass of South Africans. To a large
extent this is a function of ignorance, but Mr Andersen will not gamble on a
future government acting on its ignorance. He has, as befits a man of his
military background, launched a pre-emptive strike, in the form of
instituting a wide-ranging investigation into what the optimal structure of
the JSE is as it enters a new era.
Mr Andersen says of the investigation: 'It is an attempt to ensure the JSE
controls its own destiny. We don't want things to be imposed on us.'
Certainly, if the JSE does want to convince the mass of South Africans that
it has a wider usefulness, it has a long way to go. Although Mr Andersen is
too polite to say so, he will be aware that in terms of affirmative action
and black advancement, the broking community is at least 15 years, and much
heartache, behind the accountancy profession, where he came from. There is
not a single black broker, or trainee, on the JSE. The rewards, however, for
those who make the effort, will be rich. One observer commented cynically:
'He who gets the first black broker gets very rich.'
Political change is not the only stimulus here. In its efforts to bring
South Africa's capital markets more into line with international practice,
the government will, during the present parliamentary session, alter the
Stock Exchange Control Act, to permit, but not require, negotiated
commissions, dual capacity and corporate membership.
Aside from assessing the extent to which the JSE will go the 'Big Bang'
route - investment community opinion seems to favour negotiated commissions,
but not dual capacity and corporate membership - the investigation will also
assess how well the JSE is performing its role as a primary and secondary
market. On the former count, the JSE can point to a record R14.4bn raised
during its last financial year. Liquidity, however, remains a problem.
Market liquidity in the 1992 financial year was 4.3 per cent - considerably
lower than most stock exchanges. The main reason for this is that
institutions which dominate the market tend to hold on to lines of quality
stock which are not readily available, because their options are limited by
exchange control.
The silver lining to exchange control and poor liquidity is to be found in
share prices which are inflated by the heavy weight of institutional funds
with few alternative outlets. Gold and mining stocks have underperformed, in
line with weak commodity prices, but the industrial index has scaled record
heights. It rose above 4,600 points in late May, 12 per cent up since
January following a 40 per cent rise in 1991.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (9): Hard thinking about the future -
Mining
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE surface, it is business as usual. Mining men tell you, with the
studied assurance of the old hand talking to the ingenue, that 'Yes, we're
at the bottom of the commodity cycle, and yes it has been a long and deep
downturn, but no, we're not worried - we've been there before and we'll be
there again.'
They are being economical with the truth. Low commodity prices may well be
familiar territory for resource companies, but there are at least two
reasons for believing that South Africa's mining industry is at a more
important juncture than the bottom of another commodity cycle. The first
concerns politics - the downturn coincides with South Africa's emergence
from political isolation, an event rich in business implications. The
second, gold: in previous cycles there was the prospect of the gold price,
and hence the fortune of the industry, performing contra-cyclically. The
fact that gold has become just another commodity, however, has removed this
cushion and focused increased attention on the future of the industry which
is still at the heart of the economy.
The contribution of the mineral industry to South Africa's gross domestic
product in 1991 amounted to 10.4 per cent. Mineral exports contribute 46 per
cent of South Africa's total merchandise exports of R66.2bn. Gold share was
just over R19bn.
Beneath the veneer, there is little doubt there is some hard strategic
thinking about the way forward. Some of it will be painful - coming to
terms, for example, with the fact that the pre-eminence of gold within
exploration budgets can no longer be justified - but much of it will be
challenging. At present the impression is that while political reform has
released the industry from its geographic jail, it is still blinking as it
gets used to the light. This is hardly surprising. Management spent much of
the 80s engaged in an epic battle with a fledgling, but powerful, trade
union movement. There was little time for strategic thinking, nor did the
country's circumstances encourage it.
Understandably, the first post-sanctions trend to emerge has been the mining
houses going outward bound. Mr Brian Gilbertson, the chairman of Gencor,
clearly speaks for many when he says: 'Internationalisation is an important
priority. I don't think we've achieved anything like what we would want to
achieve.' In pursuit of this ambition, Gencor and other groups have their
geologists scouring Africa, South America and parts of Europe for deposits.
As Mr Nick Segal, group consultant on strategy and public affairs at
Johannesburg Consolidated Investments (JCI), notes, however, there are
interesting tensions in this process. From a balance sheet point of view, it
makes sense to become an operator in a First World environment where there
is a more stable operating environment, access to superior technology and
less currency risk. On the other hand, the mining houses have an irrevocably
South African complexion and hence a powerful interest in contributing to
the political and economic stability of the region by investing there.
Perhaps the trump factor in this process will be exploration. Mr Bernard van
Rooyen, executive director at Gold Fields, comments: 'South Africa has a
remarkably rich range of minerals, but it is also remarkably well explored.'
By contrast, many African countries have hardly been explored at all in the
post-colonial era. Within South Africa, Mr Van Rooyen notes, with all known
leads pursued, the challenge is to conceptualise where, in younger rock
formations, mineralisation might occur and then to find means of accessing
such deposits.
The enthusiasm with which mining houses explore opportunities abroad will
also depend on what options they have on the home front. Here the tables are
by no means evenly laid, and one reason why Gencor is understood to be
taking a fairly gloomy prognosis for the future of gold, while being more
enthusiastic about internationalisation and beneficiation as the way
forward, may be their lack of good mineral rights locally.
In terms of important projects, beneficiation is the present focus. There
should be decisions within the next six months on whether to go ahead with
the Columbus stainless steel project, a joint venture between Anglo American
and Gencor, and the Alusaf aluminium smelter - a Gencor project. Although
their costing remains unclear, Columbus will probably cost about R3bn while
Alusaf will be closer to R6bn. Both will be very large with Columbus planned
to have a smelting capacity of 600,000 tonnes a year and the Alusaf
expansion 466,000 tonnes a year.
The second half of 1992 will also see De Beers's Venetia diamond mine come
on stream, as well as the Northam platinum mine, owned by Gold Fields. All
platinum producers are expanding capacity.
The most significant recent capital expenditure announcement was Anglo
American's decision in April to spend R1.7bn on the Moab extension to the
Vaal Reefs gold mine. Some analysts have expressed scepticism about the
viability of the project, to the extent of claiming that the decision is
almost a political statement of belief in the future of gold. That may be
the effect of the announcement, especially coming at a time when the gold
price was at a six-year low of Dollars 335 an ounce, but Anglo clearly
believe they have a commercial proposition. Notwithstanding the extreme
depth and geological complexity of the mine, it has estimated recovery
grades of 11 grammes a tonne making it rich by modern standards.
In spite of Anglo's announcement, the gold industry is at a low ebb. Without
a better gold price, the industry is destined to shrink with JCI, Anglovaal
and Gold Fields all sitting on substantial deposits which cannot be viably
developed at present prices.
Although producers outwardly are putting on a brave face, most of them can
see rising costs, but no rising price. In the period 1988-91 the gold price
stayed in a very narrow range of about R1,000 per ounce with inflation
running at about 15 per cent per annum. Few are brave enough to hope for
anything better and, in spite of the enormous strides made by the industry
in containing its costs, the profitability of the marginal mines continues
to deteriorate with a number certain to close in the near future. At present
prices, uneconomic gold mines account for about 12 per cent of total
production and 15 per cent of employment.
The consequences of further lay-offs will be serious. Employment in the
industry has already shrunk from 534,000 in 1986 to about 400,000, with the
tragedy being not only that these workers often have many dependants, but
that they are in most cases illiterate and unskilled and hence have little
chance of alternative employment.
While most mining houses are involved in quasi-welfare work through
training, education, and housing assistance schemes, they are helpless to
assist once a worker is laid off. Thus it is not only for reasons of
self-interest they are hoping the upturn in the commodity cycle will be a
strong one.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (10): Catalogue of absurdities -
Patti Waldmeir visits a Karoo town where race is a tortured subject
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARNARVON, at midday, is a bleak and blighted place. On the hot pavements of
this remote Karoo town - set in what novelist Alan Paton describes so
evocatively as 'a semi-desert land of space and freedom, of heat and rock
and thorn' - jobless Coloured (mixed-race) labourers idle away the day, in
listless conversation.
White matrons pass them, dressed in the outdated fashions of South Africa's
rural heartland, before entering the cool interior of the Middle Karoo
Co-operative or the Multisave grocery. With the practiced evasion taught by
apartheid, they ignore the glances directed at them from pavement and kerb.
The new South Africa will be a long time coming to Carnarvon.
'In an area like this, I don't see how apartheid can be removed, because
people are so far apart,' says Dominee Arnie Leeuwenink, pastor of the Dutch
Reformed Mission Church, which administers to the town's coloured
population. Like every other institution in South Africa, the church has
separate branches for whites, coloureds and blacks. In Carnarvon, the white
and coloured churches are almost side by side: the coloured church (which
serves a population of 7,500) is cramped and tiny, dwarfed by the solid
edifice which serves the 800 whites.
Pastor Leeuwenink, who is white, tells a sad tale of racism in Carnarvon.
Though the church has decided in principle to integrate, he speaks wistfully
of a plan for a joint choral evening, which never seems to get off the
ground, and notes that when a few coloured students visited the white church
last year, some parishioners left in outrage to join a white-separatist
splinter church. Pastor Leeuwenink and his wife are shunned by most of the
town's whites, because they occasionally dine with their coloured
parishioners; he was detained for 45 days in 1986 as a 'communist'.
Indeed, the history of Carnarvon provides a catalogue of apartheid
absurdities rivalled by few towns in South Africa. Unusually for the Karoo,
which was originally populated by light-skinned Bushmen and Hottentots,
Carnarvon was founded as an African town, settled by Xhosa tribesmen from
the Eastern Cape.
History is flexible here: some say they were rewarded with farms at
Carnarvon because they fought on the side of white settlers in the Eastern
Cape, others that they were sent thousands of kilometres away to the Karoo
to get rid of them. Local historians also disagree on how the African
farmers lost their land: either it was stolen from them by whites, or they
sold it because they failed to farm it profitably.
Either way, Carnarvon started out as a town of whites and Africans. Yet
there is no African township in Carnarvon today: indeed, thanks to
apartheid's lunatic system of race classification, there are no Africans.
There are only Coloureds, the mixed-race group which is one rung above the
African on the apartheid ladder; coloureds live in better houses, go to
better schools and receive higher state pensions than Africans.
This is not due to wild miscegenation between Carnarvon's whites and
Africans (though illegal inter-racial sex was not uncommon). It resulted
from the actions of Mr Andries Boezak (sic), grandfather of anti-apartheid
campaigner Allan Boesak, who was charged with registering births in the
local magistrate's office. Mr Boezak, an educated man who captained the
Carvarvon cricket team in the days before apartheid, wilfully reclassified
blacks as coloureds, with no racial basis for the decision, to flout
apartheid and to ensure that the blacks of Carnarvon were not deported (as
millions were from the rest of South Africa) to a new Xhosa homeland in the
Transkei.
So when residential segregation was introduced in the 1950s, Carnarvon had
only white and coloured areas - there were no blacks, so there was no black
township. But even this threw up its own anomalies: for there was one
prominent family of Indian shopkeepers in town, but no Indian residential
area.
Apartheid deemed that the only solution was to force the Ahmed family to
move several hundred kilometres to the nearest Indian settlement. They
fought the decision in the courts, and were granted an indefinite permit to
reside in a coloured area. They outwitted apartheid, and went on to buy most
of the retail businesses in town, including that bastion of Afrikaner
business, the Middle Karoo Co-operative. And, as a final ironic twist, young
Goolam Ahmed recently purchased a homestead outside Carnarvon from a farmer
who left town to join an all-white colony nearby.
Against that background, it is small wonder that race is such a tortured
subject in Carnarvon. Integration has finally begun: since residential
segregation was abandoned last year, some 15-20 coloured families have
bought houses in the former white area. But the move was driven by
economics, not a spirit of reconciliation: the dwindling white community,
which has lost jobs due to recession and drought, could provide no buyers
for the homes, which sold at R20,000-R30,000, a fraction of their former
value.
The municipal swimming pool, too, is no longer segregated - though locals
disagree on why it is not in use. Mayor Hennie Jacobs says there is no
water; township residents believe there is a more sinister reason.
Young Koos, a coloured township activist, concedes that residential
segregation has gone, but says inter-racial relations remain the same. 'The
heart of the Boer (Afrikaner) must change,' he insists.
That, says Dominee Leeuwenink, may take a long time. 'South Africa without
apartheid will definitely be a better place, but the damage done by
apartheid is so great that it may not seem so,' he says regretfully. 'It's
like the Israelites looking back and saying it was better to be slaves in
Egypt. There's a lot of moving through the desert yet to come.'

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (7): Moderate rhetoric - The ANC's
economic policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATTI WALDMEIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE has been a revolution in the economic rhetoric of the African National
Congress (ANC) in the two years since ANC economists returned to South
Africa from exile. Only time will tell whether policy itself reflects the
moderation in rhetoric.
The movement's first economic policy document, issued in September 1990,
refers to the capital markets as a grand 'paper chase', which must be
harnessed to broad development objectives by a powerful state; calls for the
establishment of 'new state-owned financial institutions' to direct
international and domestic finance toward development; proposes a National
Development Plan to govern economic policy; and suggests voluntary or
compulsory nationalisation of strategic enterprises.
The guiding aim of the whole was to create 'growth through redistribution',
an idealistic policy based on the premise that spending money - on social
services and basic consumer goods - would somehow create wealth.
Mr Tito Mboweni, senior economist in the ANC's department of economics,
points out that the movement's April 1992 policy document does not mention
growth through redistribution. 'That is no longer our policy,' he notes,
musing: 'It's more complicated than that.'
The new policy document was debated at a crucial policy conference at the
end of last month. Its moderate message survived the conference.
Partly, this can be explained by the fact that the document skirts many
contentious issues. It eschews any 'rigid ideological framework' in
determining the role of the state in the economy, then sets out three
possibilities:
Increasing public sector economic activity through, for example,
nationalisation (subject to compensation) or by purchasing a shareholding in
companies through the market process;
Establishing new public corporations or joint ventures between the state and
the private sector; or
Reducing the role of the public sector by privatisation.
With such a list to choose from, outsiders can be certain of only one thing:
the ANC is keeping its options open on state ownership.
This also seems to be true of many other areas of policy. The old
interventionist certainties, which many ANC economists brought back from
exile in the eastern bloc, have not survived a brush with South African
economic realities.
One senior economist spent his first weeks back in Johannesburg in 1990
confidently plotting the dismemberment of Anglo American Corporation, and
the other conglomerates which dominate the economy. Now he argues that big
is not necessarily bad, and cautions against any action that would impede
the ability of the conglomerates to compete internationally. Chances are
that the ANC will, in the end, pursue an active anti-trust policy which will
reduce the exaggerated concentration of economic power; but officials insist
they will carefully weigh the risks.
'We want to mobilise resources for development, but we don't want to destroy
the economy in the process,' says Mr Max Sisulu, economics department head.
That caution is reflected in almost every recent economic pronouncement: ANC
officials favour some kind of post-apartheid levy, or wealth tax, to finance
development in the immediate aftermath of apartheid; but, in spite of
squeals from white South Africa, this is not without international
precedent.
Mr Mboweni stresses the need for fiscal discipline: 'There is a need to
avoid inflationary deficit financing at all costs'. He mentions,
approvingly, the IMF guideline that the government budget deficit should not
exceed 3 per cent of GDP; yet the present government will be lucky to run a
deficit of 5 per cent of GDP.
Given a chance, Mr Mboweni will also argue the case against a compulsory
national minimum wage, stressing the importance of job creation which might
be jeopardised by an imposed minimum. And while the September 1990 document
focuses on the responsibilities of foreign investors, - Mr Mboweni now says
the best way to attract foreign investment is to create a favourable
environment: stability, democracy, guaranteed profit remittance.
It is too soon to say whether the new moderate rhetoric of the technocrats
will survive the demands placed on the ANC's politicians when they assume
power. For some of the ANC's senior political figures take a much harder
line on nationalisation and other issues than the economists who write
policy documents.
In the battle to win and keep power, populist economics may yet win the day.

Profile, Derek Keys

<TEXT>
WHILE THE architecture of South Africa's constitutional future is
painstakingly negotiated at the Convention for a Democratic South Africa
(Codesa), the responsibility for the economic foundations of that structure
is lodged squarely with one man - Derek Keys, the minister of finance, trade
and industry and economic co-ordination.
His task is as onerous and demanding as his title is long. It is also, in a
wry sort of way, simple. He must arrest the declining standard of living of
South Africans which, if it continues unabated, will undermine any
constitutional settlement. The real gross national product per head of
population declined to R3,275 in 1991 from R3,905 in 1981.
The main issue is growth, as Mr Keys has many times stressed since taking
office in January - he assumed the Finance portfolio in May following the
resignation of Mr Barend du Plessis. Though constitutional politics still
dominate the public agenda in South Africa, the urgent need for growth is
beginning to take on mild tones of hysteria, and not without reason. South
Africa recorded negative economic growth of 0.5 per cent in each of 1990 and
1991 and looks set for another year of negative growth in 1992.
As Mr Keys is discovering, the burden of expectations is enormous. Though he
comes to the job with the unanimous blessing of the business community, he
has already been ambushed by free-market critics, particularly in the areas
of tariffs and taxes, distressed at his unwillingness to engage in
precipitate, across-the-board cuts. Others, less concerned by ideology, are
nonetheless bemused at his approach to the task at hand. A grand plan to
turn around the economy is sought, and none is forthcoming. Instead, Mr Keys
resorts to tantalising vagueness with phrases such as 'There's nothing to do
but return to the old virtues'.
Those familiar with the Keys method, however, warn against confusing style
and substance. Thus Brian Gilbertson, Mr Keys's successor as chairman of the
mining house Gencor, and one wholly admiring of his achievements, comments:
'In four years of working for Derek I never saw him do any work. When I
would come into his office he would either be reading the FT or standing at
the window looking at the pigeons outside.' On reflection, he says, there
were four or five instances in which he saw Mr Keys working. He hastens to
add, though, that Mr Keys was always impeccably prepared for board meetings,
and his interventions, measured in their frequency, were often decisive.
A memorable anecdote about Mr Keys concerns the occasion on which he
returned a memorandum delivered to him for decision by two senior managers
with the comment, 'I don't feel like Solomon today.'
What Mr Keys's civil servants make of his management style is not a matter
of public record. Some of it they will like, such as his habit of praising
his senior lieutenants lavishly, and empowering them to take important
decisions. The flip side of this they are likely to find most disconcerting
 -his resolute insistence on delegating not only the power to take
decisions, but the responsibility for them, too.
Those wishing to assess how Mr Keys is likely to approach his job would do
well to examine his time at Gencor. During the five and a half years there
he achieved enormous success, much of it attributed to his managerial style
and proficiency. He turned around an unwieldy, bureaucratic conglomerate,
whose performance and rating were poor, into a highly-rated,
entrepreneurially-driven and successful one. His main tools were to
decentralise the group structure, empower the management and focus the
group's activities through its mission of achieving real growth.
His present task may be different, but there can already be no doubt that he
is practising the same managerial principles.
For Mr Keys, the way to achieve higher growth is through more investment,
and the way to encourage this is through raising levels of confidence. This
is not something he can achieve unilaterally: political uncertainty and
violence are outside his ambit. Where he can achieve a great deal, however,
is through helping forge an economic consensus among the main political
actors.
With the establishment of an economic forum, on which the state and all the
main business and labour bodies are represented, the wheels of co-operation
are in motion. To the question of whether the forum is not just corporatism
of the sort discredited in many other countries, Mr Keys replies: 'This
country would register an economic advance if we got to the corporatist
stage.'
A crucial question is how long Mr Keys will have in office. Most businessmen
believe he needs at least five years, presiding through the transitional
phase and into the first post-apartheid government. His lack of political
and ideological baggage is a plus factor, but as one ANC spokesman
commented: 'He's a very nice fellow, but at the end of the day he's in an
apartheid cabinet.'

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (5): Battle to end the economic civil
war - Poverty will remain the most profound threat to a stable state
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
POLITICS is the least of South Africa's problems. For whether constitutional
negotiations take months or years, whether apartheid gives way to democracy
or autocracy, poverty will remain the central worry for most South Africans,
and the most profound threat to a stable state.
'The urgent need to raise living standards and improve the distribution of
income and wealth in South Africa poses a major challenge to policy-makers
over the medium term,' says a recent International Monetary Fund (IMF)
report entitled Economic Policies for a New South Africa.
'Unless the rate of economic growth rises to a level well above that of the
last decade, there is little prospect for reducing the current very high
level of under-employment in the economy or for generating address social
needs on a sustained basis.'
The irony of the new South Africa is that democratisation is itself impeding
growth: ending apartheid has meant unprecedented social turmoil, as the
battle for power pits black political groups against one another, police
against township residents, organised labour against the government.
Mr Derek Keys, the new finance minister, describes the situation as
'economic civil war'. His aim is to promote a social compact between
business, labour and the unions, to develop a 'national consensus to grow'.
'My real first priority is to find the areas of consensus,' he says, noting
'you can't make people invest here, with all the political disruption that's
taking place. I think if people see effective co-operation between business
and labour and the state . . . I think that will be the biggest single
contribution we can make to investment.'
His message could hardly be more different from that of his predecessor, Mr
Barend du Plessis, who resigned as finance minister six weeks ago after
suffering a nervous collapse. Mr du Plessis clashed repeatedly with the
largest union federation, the Congress of South African Trade Unions
(Cosatu), over issues such as the introduction of value-added tax, and
gained a reputation for arrogance and intransigence which exacerbated
economic hostilities.
Cosatu had long demanded the formation of an economic negotiating forum,
involving business, labour and the state, to debate the economic future.
Within weeks of taking up his new post (Mr Keys became minister of trade and
industry and economic co-ordination in January, adding finance to his
portfolio in May), the new minister had met representatives of business and
labour to plan the forum.
The aim will be to find 'a national consensus to hold off on consumption
expenditure and apply more to investment,' says Mr Keys. In a country where
class and economic power divide society as sharply as race and ethnicity,
this could prove a tall order. For South Africa's blacks are scarcely in the
mood to be told to defer gratification now in the interest of sustainable
long-term growth: they expect at least some minimum improvements in living
standards - clean water taps in the squatter camps, decent shelter, better
education - and the African National Congress (ANC) would ignore these
demands at its peril.
But the ANC knows that the key to future prosperity will be to promote
investment in new productive capacity to stimulate growth and job creation.
Certainly, the record of growth over the past decade could hardly be more
dismal. Real gross domestic product per capita has fallen by 1.1 per cent
annually for a decade, leaving an estimated 5.5m people, or 40 per cent of
the potential labour force, unemployed. For the past three years - when
growth could have done so much to smooth the path to political reform - the
economy has been in recession, and severe drought has made it likely that
growth this year will be negative as well.
The deteriorating fortunes of the gold industry have also impeded growth. In
the 1991/92 fiscal year gold contributed only one per cent of state revenues
compared with 9.6 per cent in 1982/83.
The imposition of international financial sanctions severely curtailed what
growth there would otherwise have been. To service the country's debt
rescheduling agreement with foreign banks, growth had to be choked off at a
very low level to avoid a surge of imports, which threatened the balance of
payments.
That constraint should soon be removed: international creditors have
recently proved much more willing to roll over maturing debts, and some new
lending should be available from commercial banks (though this will depend
on political stability); from the World Bank (which will make development
funds available once a multiracial interim government is installed); and
from the International Monetary Fund (once the US lifts its political veto
over such funding).
But Mr Chris Stals, governor of the South African Reserve Bank (central
bank), believes an economic structural adjustment programme is needed first
to create an environment conducive to growth. 'South Africa has an economy
where you get equilibrium only at a low level of growth. The moment you push
it higher, you get inflation, skills shortages, etc . . . We need to have
higher growth without disequilibrium. That requires action on monetary
policy, fiscal policy, trade policy . . . '
He argues that the Reserve Bank has succeeded in stabilising the financial
situation over the past year, with money supply growth now limited to under
10 per cent per annum (compared with 27 per cent in the late 1980s), bank
credit extension rising at a rate well below inflation, the exchange rate
stabilised and gold and foreign exchange reserves substantially
strengthened, at R9.5bn, enough to cover two months' imports. Inflation,
too, is improving, though a large drop in producer prices has yet to feed
through into consumer prices, which continue to rise at 15 per cent
annually.
But he says more remains to be done in terms of macro-economic
restructuring. On this issue, Finance Minister Keys has so far said little.
He believes that the economy is basically sound, agreeing with Mr Michael
O'Dowd, a director of Anglo American Corp, who wrote recently: 'So far from
being a 'basket case', the performance of the South African economy in
conditions of great adversity has, in recent years, been most impressive.'
If Mr Keys plans drastic restructuring to place the economy on a higher
growth path, he is not letting on. He accepts the case for lower tariffs,
but plans no dramatic cuts, arguing - against received wisdom among local
economists - that South Africa is not a high tariff economy. He shrugs off
the problem of inefficiency and corruption in the civil service, highlighted
recently when a commission of inquiry found that the government department
which administered the black homelands had wasted or embezzled millions,
perhaps billions of rands. And he defends as necessary a budget deficit
which will probably exceed 5 per cent of GDP.
'The economy is as strong as a horse,' he argues, 'but it's got too many
jockeys at the moment.'
With a characteristically colourful turn of phrase, he elaborates:
'Government is sitting facing forwards, hoping the horse will start off
moving. The ANC is on it facing backwards, trying to get the horse to move
backwards. Cosatu is sitting on sideways, hoping to claim the credit whether
it goes forward or backwards. The private sector is standing holding the
reins . . . bemused by what is happening on top of the horse.
'I see my job as persuading the private sector to start . . . leading the
horse, regardless of what the jockeys think they are doing,' he concludes.
He agrees with the IMF, that if economic growth is to be raised to 3.5 per
cent a year (the minimum rate required to reduce unemployment) the ratio of
investment to GDP will have to rise to 27 per cent from 19 per cent now. But
under the IMF's scenario, that would mean a sharply reduced government
budget deficit and average real wage growth of under 1 per cent a year. Both
those goals are probably unattainable in the face of demands for increased
social spending and for redistribution of corporate wealth.
But that, in the end, is South Africa's predicament: democracy cannot
survive without growth; but the road to democracy is littered with so many
impediments to growth - political instability, demands for social spending
which boost inflation, labour militancy - that the democratic goal may never
be achieved. It could hardly be a more daunting prospect.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (3): On top of the world again -
African and other states now welcome contact with Pretoria
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'WE'RE international now, you know,' said the immigration official at
Johannesburg's Jan Smuts international airport. She agreed not to stamp the
visitor's passport, as requested - but made clear that his caution dates
from a different era.
With barely an exception, African and other states who once refused visas to
visitors with a South African immigration stamp in their passports, now
welcome contact.
Trade that was once under the counter is coming into the open, cultural and
sporting links with the world have been revived, and President F W de Klerk
seems to be in competition with Mr Nelson Mandela, the ANC leader, over the
number of foreign capitals they can visit.
Last October's Commonwealth conference, when heads of state agreed to lift
what were termed people-to-people sanctions, such as visas and air links,
seemed itself a watershed in Pretoria's relations with the world.
However, few events better illustrated South Africa's diplomatic
breakthrough on the African continent than the effusive welcome accorded
President de Klerk on his historic visit to Nigeria last April.
In a speech that placed his guest in the pantheon of anti-apartheid heroes
that includes Mr Nelson Mandela, President Ibrahim Babangida put a seal on
Pretoria's African breakthrough, and laid the foundations for an alliance
between two regional super-powers.
South Africa's admission to the Organisation of African Unity (OAU) - of
which General Babangida is chairman - must await formation of an interim
government. But once a member, Pretoria will be able to borrow from the
African Development Bank.
Trade and political links have also been established with Egypt and Kenya -
the former seen as Pretoria's foothold in the Middle East. They complete a
trio of strategic posts on the continent which, Pretoria diplomats believe,
would also be appropriate for a post-apartheid government.
The same government officials who once had to cope with a hostile world are
now helping mould foreign policy.
For the time being, at least, the ANC remains aloof from the process. But
Pretoria's officials believe they share common concerns, including the need
for a stable transition to democracy in Angola.
'We are an African country, and our problems are African problems,' says Mr
Neil van Heerden, director-general of foreign affairs: 'We would want to say
(to industrialised countries) as a bloc: 'We won't pay the prices you want
for Mercedes if you won't pay a good price for our coal'.'
He treads carefully when reviewing foreign policy, aware that priorities may
change should constitutional negotiations reach agreement on an interim
government. But he believes that foreign policy, in the past dominated by
adversarial relationships, will now be strongly influenced by trading links.
'Our main priority is the Pacific rim,' says Mr van Heerden, and expresses
some doubt about prospects for membership of the Lome convention, which
offers a group of developing countries preferential access to Europe's
markets.
Membership may be difficult and a protracted process, Mr van Heerden
believes. 'We would look instead for a bilateral agreement between Pretoria
and Brussels.'
Eastern Europe, once a focus of attention, seems to be declining in
significance for Pretoria.' There was a surge of enthusiasm,' says Mr van
Heerden, which led the opening or revival of several trade missions, 'but
now we regret it because what you find behind the Iron Curtain is a
collection of poor countries.'
State and city sanctions will continue to inhibit trade with the United
States, but there will be a recovery of US business interest in South
Africa, says Mr van Heerden.
The number of American companies fell from 360 to 110 as the disinvestment
campaign took its toll: 'Now we're seeing US corporations probing the market
again.'

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (3): A high degree of violence -
Reasons for the soaring crime rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THE criminals who rob, rape and murder seem to grow in number every day,
and seem to get more desperate and brutal with each passing moment'.
Mr Nelson Mandela struck a common chord in his closing address to the second
round of constitutional talks last month.
Apart from anxiety about the outcome of negotiations themselves, no subject
so preoccupies South Africa than the upsurge in crime, and the gratuitous
nature of the violence that often accompanies it.
Among white South Africans, relatively untouched by the political violence
that scars many black townships, it is a subject of almost obsessive
concern. Whatever the causes of the crime wave, it undermines their
confidence in the transition from apartheid to democracy. For black South
Africans, who bear the burden of political violence, rising crime levels add
to the burden of deprivation.
The figures themselves tell an alarming story. Criminal offences in general
increased 10 per cent last year, compounding a rise of 8.5 per cent in 1990
over 1989; armed robberies were up 16 per cent (27 per cent in 1990 over
1989); housebreaking in traditionally white suburbs rose 13 per cent (22 per
cent), and by double that figure in non-white areas.
The number of whites murdered went up from 305 in 1989 to 488 in 1991,
blacks from 11,445 to 14,205, almost certainly linked to the 92 per cent
increase in cases of illegal possession of arms and ammunition. (By
comparison, 708 people died violently in England and Wales in 1991 out of a
population of about 50m.)
But the bare statistics do not convey a pervasive mood of unease. A suburban
housewife is shot dead in front of her children when her minibus is
hijacked; a baby is shot during another car hijacking; a politician
describes the night he and other diners at a Johannesburg restaurant were
held up by armed men; an office worker tells of muggings in Soweto.
Security has become a growth industry. Concerned householders are offered
electronically-operated gates and garage doors, video intercoms, armed
patrols, Alsatian dogs, barbed wire fencing, panic alarms, radio car
patrols, and for those who wish to take no chances, 'European supervision at
night'.
South Africans black and white derive small consolation when told that all
over Africa the picture seems broadly the same. Economies are depressed,
unemployment is rising, police forces understaffed and under-equipped, and
weapons easy to come by.
From Lusaka to Lagos, private security companies flourish, residents seek
protection behind high walls topped with shards of broken glass, behind iron
gates and barred windows, and hotels warn guests to take care after dark.
It may well be, however, that politics and crime overlap in a way that makes
South Africa unique. 'Criminals have become politicised, and politicians
become criminals,' observes one sociologist.
A depressed economy highlights the grim legacy of apartheid, political
reform falls behind aspirations, ex-soldiers and guerrillas turn their
talents to crime.
At the same time, the role of the police force - nearly 55 per cent of whose
members are black or coloured (mixed-race) - is blurred. One third of the
110,000-strong force are used to curb political violence, weakening its
capacity to deal with run-of-the-mill crime.
AK47s, the ubiquitous weapons of guerrillas in southern Africa, can be
bought for a few hundred rands, hired over the weekend for less. Many of the
rifles have been brought across the border from Mozambique, where
poorly-paid soldiers and rebels readily sell or barter their rifles.
According to a police spokesman, some 1,881 AK47 rifles were seized or
handed in during 1991 - 'a drop in the ocean,' comments a private security
company - as well as nearly 1,800 other rifles and 2,227 pistols.
Within the white community, dealing in weapons is done over the counter at
gun stores catering for hunters and anxious householders alike.
At the end of 1991, there were 1.2m licensed fire-arm holders, with 3.2m
fire-arms - suggesting in a total white population of 5m, most white adults
possess a weapon.
The good news, however, is that violence on the political front, has been
abating - though the situation could change rapidly, particularly after the
failure of the last round of constitutional talks.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (2): Struggle for power -
Monarchists, nationalists and communists negotiate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HOLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT'S BEEN called South Africa's first multiracial parliament, and its
deliberations are shaping the country's constitutional future.
Since last December, the World Trade Centre on the outskirts of
Johannesburg, has been home to Codesa - the Convention for a Democratic
South Africa.
Apprehensive about the outcome, often baffled by the complexities of the
debate, the whole of South Africa seems absorbed by an extraordinary
spectacle: Zulu monarchists and Afrikaner nationalists, Tswana secessionists
and white communists, all searching for a peaceful solution to their
country's problems.
In principle, power continues to rest in the country's tricameral assembly
in Cape Town from which blacks are excluded.
In practice, the assembly concentrates on routine administration, suspending
innovative functions, becoming what one commentator called 'a kind of
legislative handmaiden' to Codesa, an assembly of 19 political parties
undertaking an exercise without precedent in Africa.
The ultimate objective is a constitution which reconciles minority rights
and majority rule, and which ensures an appropriate limit to the power of a
central executive over regional and local authorities.
Nearly all the leading political players are in attendance, the notable
exceptions being the extreme right Conservative Party and two radical black
parties, the Pan Africanist Congress (PAC) and the Azanian People's
Organisation (Azapo).
Separate delegations represent the South African government and the
country's ruling National Party, and the African National Congress (ANC) and
the South African Communist Party (SACP). It is a curious arrangement. The
first two are one and the same, and the latter are the Siamese twins of
South African politics, proclaiming a common cause and bonded by a
long-standing alliance - but the arrangement suits the heavyweights at the
negotiating table.
Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi's Zulu-based Inkatha Freedom Party is also at the
conference - but not the chief, who has stayed away in protest at the
refusal of Codesa to give a separate seat to Chief Goodwill Zwelithini in
his capacity as monarch of the Zulu nation.
The predominantly white, liberal Democratic Party led by Dr Zach de Beer,
one of the country's elder statesmen, plays a mediating role. The Indian
community, the smallest of South Africa's race groups, has no fewer than
three representatives at Codesa: the conservative Solidarity and National
People's parties, and a joint delegation from the anti-apartheid Natal and
Transvaal Indian Congresses. Delegates of the Coloured (mixed race) Labour
party look on while leaders of the nominally independent homelands -
collectively termed the TBVC states - contemplate their options.
Transkei has thrown in its lot with the ANC; Bophuthatswana nurtures hopes
of independence, or at least autonomy in a federal South Africa; Venda and
Ciskei will probably opt for re-incorporation.
Decisions are by consensus. But if that proves impossible, by 'sufficient
consensus' - a splendid example of South Africa's coded political
vocabulary, which at Codesa generally means 'when the government and ANC
agree'.
Last month, however, saw confrontation rather than consensus. Delegates
re-assembled for Codesa's second plenary session to consider reports from
five working groups, appointed at the opening round last December. They
dealt with five key issues:
Creating a climate conducive to negotiations or 'levelling the political
playing field', as it has become known.
Constitutional principles, and a constitution-making body.
Agreeing on arrangements for the transition.
Determining the future of the homelands.
Working out the timetable for change.
Four of the committees were able to reach broad agreement and present their
reports, although some serious differences were papered over.
However, Codesa failed to clear what may prove to be its most important
hurdle: an agreement on how decisions are to be taken in the
constitution-making body, paving the way for installation of a transitional
executive and elections to the constituent assembly, which will also act as
an interim legislature.
Underlying the proposals and counter-proposals about the percentages
required for decision-making in the constituent assembly is the fundamental
issue: where will power lie in a post-apartheid South Africa?
Or to put it another way: Will whites, in alliance with minority black
parties, have a veto on change?
Codesa ended in deadlock. The working groups were suspended, and the
management committee - comprising senior members of all main parties - was
charged with finding a way out of the most serious hold-up in the
negotiating process since Mr Nelson Mandela's release in February 1990.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Survey of South Africa (1): Democracy in the balance - The
transition to multiracial rule is proving difficult and slow as whites
battle to preserve power and privilege. Patti Waldmeir assesses the prospect
for establishing freedom and stability in one of the most divided societies
in the world
</HEADLINE>

WHAT will replace apartheid in South Africa?
Will South Africans rise above their 350-year history of division and
exploitation to build a liberal, multiracial democracy, a model to divided
societies worldwide? Will they experiment with democracy, but fail, leaving
black domination to replace white oppression? Or will the country's
politicians, black and white, do an unholy deal to stifle dissent and
restore civil order, jointly imposing authoritarian rule?
After two years of horrifying political violence, tortuous negotiations
which have yielded little obvious progress, an accelerating decline in black
living standards, and an explosion of crime, many South Africans are
suffering from a crisis of confidence about their future.
The tremendous sense of relief and elation which greeted the release from
prison two years ago of Mr Nelson Mandela, African National Congress (ANC)
president - and the vision of a brave new egalitarian future which he
inspired - has proved difficult to sustain under the pressures of political
transition.
The historical imperatives which drove white and black to the negotiating
table remain the same - in spite of the failure of last month's plenary
session of the Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa), the
constitutional negotiating forum. Codesa is floundering, and the
installation of a multiracial interim government, which had been expected
within weeks, now seems likely to be delayed.
But the reality remains that neither the ANC, the largest black group, nor
the ruling National Party, the most powerful white party, can run South
Africa on its own. They need each other, and sooner or later, they will
strike a deal. What is not certain is whether it will be a fully democratic
deal.
'There is nothing inevitable about a democratic outcome to transition in
South Africa,' says Professor Frederik van Zyl Slabbert, a former liberal
politician who has stimulated debate on future political systems. 'I think
we have the capacity to become democratic, but if I have to be very frank, I
cannot see us approaching it within the next 10 years . . . The dynamics of
the transition may precipitate undemocratic options.'
None of the 19 parties to Codesa exhibit truly democratic instincts. They
all pay lip service to democracy. But the National Party has only recently
discovered the need for political tolerance - now that its own interests are
at risk - and the ANC permits dissent only so long as it does not threaten
unity. Both are deeply suspicious of the press, intolerant of criticism,
dirigiste in their economic policies and authoritarian by nature.
Indeed, the two sides have already largely agreed that a multi-party interim
government should retain similar emergency powers to those exercised so
brutally by the National Party, which detained 40,000 people in the late
1980s. In a passage chillingly reminiscent of the bad old days of apartheid,
a working document agreed to by all the Codesa parties notes that 'special
measures are necessary to deal with the threat to public order during the
transitional period', including detention without trial (subject to
unspecified 'procedural controls'), and powers to declare a state of
emergency on the advice of an unelected interim executive appointed by
Codesa.
Senior National Party officials admit privately that they envisage a period
of authoritarian rule until the end of the decade - imposed in the interests
of stability and economic growth - and the ANC, worried about its ability to
control its own constituents, seems likely to agree.
Both have already agreed to rule by coalition, in a government of national
unity aimed at reconciling all South Africans to a new constitution. The
duration of the coalition is still in dispute: the government wants
coalition government to be entrenched in an interim and a permanent
constitution. If the National Party has its way, South Africa will be
governed for decades by a coalition which would guarantee the political role
of whites.
The ANC, for its part, is intent on achieving majority rule - though it
favours voluntary coalition for the first two to five years of the new
regime. Some moderate ANC officials believe the government of national unity
should last until the end of the century. For the National Party, though,
coalition government on its own will not be enough to prevent abuse of power
by the (black) majority. It wants a constitution which devolves power
substantially to regional and local government - making it impossible for
central government to dominate.
The party's position is that South Africa's fragmented and fractious society
cannot be governed peacefully from the centre. That may well be so, but the
drive for regionalism has a more immediate goal: to accommodate the
political ambitions of Zulu Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, who would be
guaranteed power in his ethnic base of Natal. He could never compete as a
national politician but he would resist - perhaps violently - being
sidelined under a unitary constitution.
Strong regional government would achieve another cherished National Party
goal. It would ensure that the Western Cape, the only region where blacks do
not form the majority, would become, in the words of one junior minister, a
kind of 'haven for civilised western values'. (This assumes that whites and
coloureds (mixed-race peoples) would make common cause together against
Africans, probably a realistic assumption.)
The ANC, with its ideal of non-racialism, finds such notions abhorrent but
its officials are realistic enough to admit that ethnicity cannot simply be
wished away, and that devolution can help accommodate it. In a recent paper
entitled 'Rooting Democracy on African Soil', ANC constitutional lawyer Zola
Skweyiya argues: 'It is necessary to consider the challenge that ethnicity
poses to democratic transformation and the way in which this challenge may
be diffused.
'The experiences of independent Africa, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and the former
USSR have demonstrated clearly how difficult it is to replace individual
ethnic identities by a commitment to a single overarching nationalism.'
But Mr Skweyiya acknowledges that his view is not received wisdom within the
ANC and many tough battles lie ahead before the new government's structure
is agreed.
Indeed, the next few months could prove the most difficult so far in the
transition. Codesa must resolve the central question of who wields power in
the new South Africa. Will whites have an effective veto, through an upper
house packed with political minorities? Will they exercise a veto over the
new constitution, by insisting that all clauses are passed by three-quarters
majority? How much power will devolve to regions?
The ANC will not easily relinquish its demand for a majority-rule
constitution, but this is incompatible with the National Party's bottom line
 -a large political role for whites, guaranteed indefinitely. The movement
will be tempted to exercise its own veto over the process of reform, by
calling for a general strike and other forms of mass protest.
Meanwhile, economic growth - which is so crucial to stability - will
continue to be sabotaged by political upheaval.
But given South Africa's peculiar legacy of apartheid and ethnic diversity,
poverty and isolation, nation-building was never going to be easy. With any
luck, the inter-racial goodwill which persists against all the odds, the
Christian commitment of most South Africans, and the desire for economic
advancement will ensure that South Africa avoids the risk of social
disintegration. It remains to be seen whether democracy will survive the
strains of the transition.

FT  05 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Midland in demand again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUYERS returned to Midland Bank ahead of an eagerly expected statement today
from Lloyds Bank, the counterbidder for control of Midland. Enthusiasm also
sprang from the sale of Midland's travel agency business and approval in the
US for the Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking (HSBC) bid. Despite the lower than
normal client business, caused by a blackout of the electronic trading
system, there were 18m shares dealt and the stock closed 10 up at 467p.
More than a third of the turnover was said to have reflected large agency
crosses by broker James Capel, which has been buying on behalf of HSBC.
Other investors were trading in the hope that Lloyds will today increase its
bid to well above 500p a share. Also, HSBC announced that the US Federal
Reserve Bank had given clearance for the proposed merger and finally Midland
said it has agreed the sale of the historic Thomas Cook travel agency to LTU
Group and Westdeutsche Landesbank Girozentrale of Germany for more than
Pounds 200m. The sale had been expected but analysts said it was good for
sentiment.
Dowty deals
The battle for control of aerospace and information technology company Dowty
Group moved up a gear yesterday when SG Warburg, acting for predator TI
Group, went into the market to acquire up to 10 per cent of Dowty, the limit
allowed under UK takeover rules in the Pounds 525.7m bid.
Warburg was reported to have offered 189p a share for stock and the turnover
of 50m shares by the close of business indicated that the broker had
purchased the 24m shares for which it had gone shopping. The broker is
believed to have acquired the number of shares it wanted by lunchtime and
one institution was said to have sold half its holding in Dowty yesterday.
Shares in Dowty improved 6 up at 182p, while TI added 7 to 364p.
Dowty is to report full-year figures today and the company has indicated
profits for the year to March 1992 to be Pounds 32m, against Pounds 20m the
previous year. There were suggestions in the market yesterday that
current-year profits could exceed Pounds 50m.
Boots suffers
Reduced profit forecasts led to a fall in Boots, which lost 23 to 467p
yesterday. This followed disappointment at the company's results and
speculation that it intends to spend Pounds 15m to Pounds 20m on marketing
its Manoplax heart drug.
County NatWest cut its estimate for the 1992-93 by Pounds 4m to Pounds 402m,
while Nomura reduced to Pounds 395m from Pounds 415m, and the average figure
seemed to have dropped to around Pounds 400m.
Analysts also expressed concern about increased costs at Boots the Chemists
retailing chain and said margins had not improved as much as expected. They
added that, in the longer term, the main worry about the company was whether
Manoplax and Boots retailing interests, other than pharmacies, would be able
to carry the group forward.
Others said the profit figure of Pounds 359.5m, after stripping out property
gains, was below expectations, and although the company had not done badly
there was general weakness in several divisions, including pharmaceuticals
which had a depressed second half.
Fisons failed to gain from a statement by Boots that it will take a look at
the company's healthcare business, which Fisons wants to sell. Fisons shares
were steady at 362p.
Kingfisher, the Woolworth and B&amp;Q holding company remained out of favour,
falling 10 to 535p, partly in sympathy with Boots and also in reaction to a
gloomy statement at this week's annual meeting.
A higher oil price, predictions that the cost of Brent crude would continue
to rise and a more positive attitude from US investment houses helped the
oil majors.
Brent crude was firmly above Dollars 21.50 yesterday and technical analysts
claimed that July oil futures on the International Petroleum Exchange in
London were set to exceed Dollars 22 a barrel.
BP was up 3 at 271p with 11m shares traded. Salomon Brothers was said to be
recommending the stock and Lehman Brothers raised its earnings per share
forecast for 1992 by 2.7p to 15.8p and its 1993 figure by 4.6p to 16.5p.
Lehman increased its forecast to reflect a raised projection for the average
price of Brent crude; the house is now looking at Dollars 20.25 for this
year and Dollars 21 for next year. Lehman analyst Mr Jeremy Hudson still had
reservations about BP's fundamentals but believed the dividend was now
secure. He takes a more positive line on Shell Transport which, he says,
will be pulled up by the strength in Royal Dutch and still has a 10 per cent
upside in the price. Shell picked up 5 to 512p.
An announcement that Standard Chartered is to receive Dollars 62m (Pounds
34.4m) from an out of court settlement in respect of a litigation claim
failed to boost the shares. Standard is still overshadowed by its exposure
to problems in the Bombay stock market and the shares merely held at 480p.
Among utilities Anglian Water gained 8 to 437p, as analysts decided it had
changed its image for relatively low dividends, after being the first water
company to provide dividend growth of over 10 per cent in this year's
reporting season. Anglian reported profits of Pounds 171.3m for the year to
March 31, compared with Pounds 152.5m, a rise of 12.3 per cent, and a climb
in the full year dividend to 19.3p from 17.5p.
Property companies remained under a cloud, with MEPC slipping 15 to 315p.
Builders merchant Norcros gained 17 to 148p as the company reported slightly
higher profits of Pounds 15.6m, against Pounds 15.0m last year. Norcros said
the second half showed particular improvement, benefitting from
restructuring, and it was optimistic about increased economic confidence.
Tobacco shares weakened on fears about an anti-smoking ruling by the US
Supreme Court. Rothmans 'B' fell 18 to 1070p and BAT Industries gave up 15
to 795p.
Regional brewer Marston Thompson and Evershed rose 3 to 257p on news that
the company had signed a reciprocal distribution agreement with Courage, the
UK brewing arm of Fosters. This followed a similar deal announced between
Marston's and Bass on Wednesday.
Realisation that it had been ignored recently helped Courtaulds. The
chemicals group rebounded 13 to 565p after the chemicals team at Smith New
Court pointed out at the morning conference that the shares were down by
around 8 per cent over the past month.
The winning of a supply contract from Qatar boosted Vosper Thornycroft which
improved 5 to 300p.
Lucas Industries retreated 6 to 137p, after James Capel weighed in with a
profits downgrading.

FT  05 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Topic problem blindfolds the market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A VOLATILE if eventually successful recovery in London equities from this
week's shocks on the Maastricht front was confused yesterday by a prolonged
breakdown in the Stock Exchange electronic information network. The lack of
reliable price information drove the institutions to the sidelines for much
of the day.
Equities closed little changed on the session with the FT-SE Index finally 1
point up at 2,681.9. But the session started badly when renewed selling of
the FT-SE June futures contract from Europe, and also further losses in UK
gilts, drove the stock market down by about 15 Footsie points.
At this stage, just after 9.00am, the Stock Exchange Topic system ran into
software problems which left the market effectively without trading screens
until late in the afternoon. Share prices were quoted on the screens, but on
an 'indicative basis', with the marketmakers left to negotiate with clients
by telephone.
The confusion was all the greater because of the selling of the futures
contract. Marketmakers struggled to arbitrage between futures and the
underlying blue chip stocks. Investment clients, including the full range of
institutional funds, tried to evaluate share prices which were changed
during the course of telephone conversations.
The market steepened its fall, although most investors had no way of
measuring its performance. Both institutional and private clients
effectively abandoned trading, depriving marketmakers and brokers of the
day's commission business, and tempers grew increasingly frayed.
Share price data and information was available to most stock market firms by
means of direct digital links with the Stock Exchange, but not many
investment clients have these. Further confusion was generated when it
became clear that substantial blocks of shares in Midland Bank were changing
hands as the market braced itself for the meeting of the Lloyds Bank board
today - a meeting that could produce new developments in the battle for
control of Midland.
By mid-session, genuine share trading was virtually at a standstill, and the
marketmakers were left to deal with one another as they arbitraged between
the stock market and an index futures contract which was at a discount to
cash on several occasions.
However, a recovery set in when the Paris bond market, the immediate cause
of Wednesday's upset in UK equities, rebounded strongly. UK Government bonds
recovered from early losses which have ranged to around a full point and the
stock index futures market quickly turned better. Much of this good news was
lost on the average investor since the trading screens remained 'indicative
only' until barely 45 minutes before trading ended for the day.
The day's Seaq total of 505.9m shares compared very favourably with
Wednesday's 473.6m, but these figures make no distinction between customer
and intra-market business. Traders expect to see confirmation of a large
fall in the customer business total, which will be disclosed today.

FT  05 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SUCCESSFUL bond auction in Paris helped to reverse falls in stock index
futures which had seen the contract fall to trade at a discount to the cash
market, writes Joel Kibazo.
The negative sentiment overhanging the June contract on the FT-SE on
Wednesday continued in the early part of yesterday's session and the
contract opened at an 8-point discount to the cash market, at 2,672.
Continued falls in the gilts and currency market only served to bring out
more sellers. June had fallen to 2,657 within an hour and a half of the
market's opening.
A feeling that the contract had been oversold, however, started to take hold
mid-morning. This helped to steady June, preventing further falls before the
news from Paris floated through to the London markets to help June not only
regain lost ground but surge beyond its opening level.
Dealers reported sizeable spread trading - aggressive buying of June and
selling of September. June closed at 2,687, up 7 and at around its fair
value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover at 10,019 was again good.
Traded options turnover reached 26,353 lots with the FT-SE option trading
10,723 contracts. Hanson was the busiest stock option. It traded 1,459 lots
with the November 240 calls the busiest series.

FT  05 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Manila hits new peak as
Nikkei drops by 1.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE-RELATED trading manipulated share prices amid thin volume
yesterday, and the Nikkei average lost 1.2 per cent as it fell through the
18,000 level, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei retreated 224.61 to 17,964.07 at the close, having opened at the
day's high of 18,182.26, and slipped to the day's low of 17,892.61 in the
afternoon.
Volume fell to 220m shares from 251m, as investors avoided the stock market
ahead of next week's quarterly expiry of index futures contracts.
Declines outnumbered advances by 659 to 246, with 173 issues remaining
unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost 12.28 to
1,354.10 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50 index fell 4.07 to 1,067.41.
Profit-taking in the futures market prompted arbitrageurs to unwind
positions. Traders said that some jitters over unwinding of June futures
contracts on next weeks's expiration day were alleviated by comments from
life assurers, indicating commitment to buy shares at cheaper levels.
The weaker yen discouraged some investors as it lost ground against the
dollar, in spite of continued dollar selling intervention by the Bank of
Japan.
Traders focused on bio-technology related stocks, following reports that a
government advisory panel had recommended the approval of imports and sales
of Didanosine (DDI), an anti-Aids drug from the US. Meiji Milk Products, the
most active issue of the day, rose Y17 to Y931. Ajinomoto, the foods company
engaged in DDI development, advanced Y30 to Y1,340.
Nippon Mining, previously sought on its development of an Aids drug, lost
Y14 to Y471 on profit-taking.
High-technology blue chips lost ground on liquidation of tokkin, or
specified money trusts. The sector lacked support from foreign investors,
who have been the recent buyers. Hitachi lost Y10 to Y790 and NEC fell Y15
to Y928.
Banking stocks lost ground. The issues are vulnerable to arbitrage selling
due to the low market liquidity. Industrial Bank of Japan fell Y40 to Y1,790
and Sakura Bank lost Y20 to Y1,090.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 156.90 to 20,665.38 in volume of 17.7m
shares. Roundup
A dull day in the region yesterday was enlivened by Manila, which set a new
record high.
MANILA rose on strong foreign buying and the composite index closed up
57.31, or 3.9 per cent, at 1,496.73. Market sentiment has been improving on
the likely victory of Mr Fidel Ramos in the presidential election. Turnover
was down to 235m pesos from 299m.
HONG KONG weakened on news that Hongkong Telecom was to lose its domestic
monopoly in 1995. The Hang Seng index ended 1.57 lower at 6,035.80 while
Telecom closed 25 cents weaker at HKDollars 9.15. Turnover was HKDollars
4.24bn, up from HKDollars 3.83bn.
SINGAPORE finished lower in dull trade. The Straits Times Industrial index
lost 6.28 to 1,507.44 as losses led gains by 127 to 75.
Banking stocks were firm on institutional demand while shipyard stocks shed
recent gains.
SEOUL eased in spite of intervention by the stock stabilisation fund. The
composite index lost 0.17 to 568.81 in turnover of Won196.6bn.
TAIWAN came off the day's highs on profit-taking; the weighted index closed
2.64 higher at 4,586.61, having been more than 40 ahead at one stage.
Financials were strong but many industrials were lower, with construction
leading the falls. Turnover climbed to TDollars 32.3bn from TDollars 28.2bn.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index shed 1.5 to 1,676.7, off the day's low of
1,673.9. The selling of stock to buy futures contracts boosted turnover to
ADollars 353.8m.
SA Brewing, which has proposed an ADollars 6bn merger with Foster's, closed
4 cents stronger at ADollars 3.12.
NEW ZEALAND consolidated with the NZSE-40 index gaining 0.94 to 1,582.52 in
turnover of some NZDollars 43m.
BOMBAY lost over 3 per cent on news that the police had raided three brokers
accused of using bank funds to purchase stocks. The BSE index lost 96.74 to
3,004.92.
BANGKOK improved but sentiment remains dull. The SET Index rose 5.30 to
684.82 in turnover of Bt2.77bn.

FT  05 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Analysts cautious about Elkem's revival
 -This year's recovery leaves the shares a long way below their best
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Oslo has reacted quietly to the Danish referendum vote this week but its
favourite bombed-out equity, Elkem, has burst into life again with its free
shares up from NKr102 last Friday, through NKr114 on Wednesday to NKr117
yesterday.
The light metals producer staged an apparently impressive first quarter
share price recovery, the free shares rising by 26.5 per cent against a 3.4
per cent gain for the Norwegian component of the FT-Actuaries World Index
series.
This was as nothing compared with the gains for April alone: 38.4, and 2.1
per cent respectively, after which there was a 3.7 per cent fall in May,
compared with a 2.0 per cent gain for the market as a whole.
However, analysts are inclined to say that inherent financial and cyclical
risks should restrain further advances in the shares. Their caution is
understandable, for Elkem's share price performance since 1989 has made the
most terrifying of rollercoasters seem tame.
Peaking in 1989 at NKr400, Elkem ended last year's free-fall at NKr59 after
plunging to a year low of NKr39 on December 2. By comparison, it achieved a
year's high in 1991 of NKr185.
Mr Anders Braatenius, an analyst with Goldman Sachs in London, says that
Elkem's ebullience stems from a 5 to 10 per cent rise in US and European
metal prices, and a better-than-expected first quarter financial
performance. Ferro manganese prices seem to be the only obstacle to overall
price strength as they continue to fall.
But Mr Braatenius believes that Elkem's glory days are over: 'I don't think
Elkem will ever get back into the NKr400 range,' he says, 'and
fundamentally, we cannot justify a price higher that NKr110.'
He believes that a restructuring of the domestic ferro-silicon market could
help shore up Elkem once the company's consolidation begins to yield
positive results. Last year, the company posted sales of NKr7.8bn and a
pre-tax loss of NKr572m compared with the previous year's NKr230m pre-tax
loss on NKr8bn of sales. Since end-December 1990 it has shed some 600 jobs,
but plans call for a further 400 to be cut this year. Elkem reckons each
employee costs it up to NKr300,000 annually.
Barclays de Zoete Wedd points out that with a very weak balance sheet and
gearing in excess of 200 per cent at the end of last year, Elkem's net debt
position could deteriorate further this year. If the cycle does not turn by
mid-1993, it warns, 'Elkem will almost certainly be in serious financial
problems'.
'Elkem has lost market share in Europe as it has to comply with a minimum
price agreement between the EC and Norway,' adds BZW, although the aluminium
business is 'holding up well' due to a large share of 1991 production having
been sold at higher prices.
'However,' say the brokers, 'Elkem's markets are subject to over-capacity
and unusually high metal stock levels which is why we expect only a minor
improvement in the market balance.'
BZW says that Elkem's main objective - to rein in costs to a level where the
company can remain in the black at the trough of the cycle - has proved an
impossible aim so far. 'The rewards (of the Elkem stock) are potentially
great but the financial risk leaves it in the highly speculative category,'
it adds.
But Elkem may yet surprise the market further. Mr Bjoern Segrov, an Elkem
executive, highlights the company's policy of disposing of non-strategic
assets.
Elkem is seeking to shed its real estate shareholdings and, in addition, it
is currently in negotiations with the Danish company, Rockwool, which is
considering the acquisition of Elkem's 50 per cent Norwegian Rockwool
shareholding in three plants in Norway.
Mr Segrov adds that Elkem's board hopes to appoint a permanent president and
chief executive officer before July, but this does not imply a change of
direction in strategy. Mr Fredrik Vogt Lorentzen, Elkem's former CEO left
the company mid-March after failing to achieve his personal goal to restore
the company to profitability even in 'bad times'.

FT  05 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Continental hangover after
Maastricht vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OR TWO bourses still suffered an emotional hangover from Wednesday's EC
referendum events, writes Our Markets Staff.
According to the investment strategists, they had cause. At Goldman Sachs,
Mr Sushil Wadhwani said that the short term outlook for European equities
had deteriorated considerably since the Danish rejection of Maastricht.
At Morgan Stanley, Mr David Roche concurred, saying that the argument for
European equity assets had weakened; but that France, Germany, the Benelux
countries and the UK remained sound, and were the most defensive.
FRANKFURT reversed Wednesday's trend, shrugging off early weakness to end
with modest gains. After a 6.38 fall to 712.68 in the FAZ index at
midsession, reflecting Wednesday's later weakness on the Danish and French
EC referendum moves, the DAX index recovered to close 3.73 higher at
1,792.31. Volume eased from DM6.9bn to DM6.8bn.
Mr Patrick Bettscheider of Bank Julius Bar in Frankfurt said that this was a
traders' market in the main, nervous about derivatives trading but banking
on Germany as a safe haven amid European disarray; some pension funds came
in on the buying side.
In one case, a little institutional buying went a long way. Porsche rose
another DM51 to DM560, up DM80 since Monday. Tuesday's news of a fall of 32
per cent in the group's US car sales in May, the loss of another 550 jobs
and a drop in parent company operating profits this year drew domestic
newspaper comment and, yesterday, some bottom-fishing by just one investment
buyer.
Meanwhile, the ball bearings group, Kugelfischer, dropped DM8.50 to
DM252.50, taking its loss to DM22.40 since last Friday's 1992 high, and the
shares back to where they were after a deep dividend cut in mid-May. On
Wednesday, Kugelfischer piled on the agony with a forecast of a net loss for
1992.
PARIS recovered its breath and began to take stock of yesterday's dramatic
events. While the CAC-40 managed a positive end to the day, closing 2.26
higher at 1,994.87, it fell as low as 1,972 during the session. With the
dealers keeping their eyes on the bond market the low was reached when trade
in Ecu bond futures was briefly halted during the morning. However, a
successful franc bond auction later lifted sentiment.
BSN also weighed on the market following news that Brussels opposed Nestle's
takeover of Perrier. Under the proposals Nestle would sell the Volvic
division of Perrier to BSN; the latter sank to the day's low of FFr1,076
before recovering to finish down FFr10.00 at FFr1,091.00.
The financial sector recovered from Wednesday's decline with Societe
Generale advancing FFr12.00 to FFr532.00 and Paribas up FFr6.40 at
FFr408.00.
MILAN did not like the European uncertainty, leading blue chips weakened and
the Comit index fell again, by 4.42 to 492.90. Speculation that the Milan
kickback scandal was about to involve senior Italian politicians and make
the formation of a government more difficult also dissuaded buyers.
ZURICH's year-on-year inflation fell to 4.4 per cent in May from 5.1 per
cent in April, raising hopes that today's nationwide inflation figure will
also be lower. The SMI index edged up 1.7 to 1,916.9.
AMSTERDAM firmed as the market generally ignored the Masstricht upset which,
it was felt, has few short term implications for the Netherlands. The CBS
Tendency Index closed up 0.4 at 130.6 in light turnover of Fl 546.3m.
KLM was the main interest as the airline group said that it would resume
dividend payments. It closed 80 cents higher at Fl 40.30.
MADRID weakened, the general index losing 2.36 to 258.06 in turnover of some
Pta12.6bn. Fecsa lost Pta11 to Pta741 on rumours, later denied, that the
company would not be paying a dividend. Tubacex fell Pta32 to Pta242 after
saying that it had entered temporary receivership. Some analysts said that
trading in the steel tube company may be suspended today.
BRUSSELS eased on the first day of the new forward account. Dividend
payments by Solvay and Delhaize had some effect on the Bel-20 index which
lost 7.13 to 1,224.10 in turnover of BFr967m.
STOCKHOLM worried that the refusal of Danish voters to ratify the Maastricht
Treaty would lead to the collapse of the EMS and delay Swedish EC
membership. The Affarsvarlden General index slipped 4.2 to 979.7.
COPENHAGEN slipped again in the wake of Denmark's Maastricht referendum
result, writes Hilary Barnes. The all-share index was down 3.66 at 331.47.
Turnover was moderate, falling to DKr147m.
VIENNA fell but still maintained its position above the 1,000 level. The ATX
index closed 3.67 weaker at 1,003.26.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: D-Mark firm in calm trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Activity in foreign exchange trading was considerably calmer yesterday
following the market's stormy reaction to Denmark's decision not to
participate in European Monetary Union, writes James Blitz.
The D-Mark ended the day slightly down against most European currencies from
Wednesday's close. But it still retained most of the gains made in the
aftermath of Denmark's referendum decision, as dealers remained unsure of
the immediate outlook on European exchange rates. 'There's clearly a
question mark over the route map of Emu,' said Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief
economist of Yamaichi International in London. 'There is also much more of a
currency risk for the bond markets, with the financial markets having to
price in the possibility of a currency realignment.'
Sterling ended the day  1/4 pfennig higher against the D-Mark, closing at
DM2.9175. The French franc suffered further loss, closing at around FFr3.370
to the D-Mark, from a previous close of FFr3.368. Analysts believed that the
French currency had done well to hold its ground considering the French
government's decision to hold a referendum on Emu this autumn. The currency
may have been helped by a statement from Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance
minister, that inflation is set to fall to 2.8 per cent by the end of the
year from its current level of 3.1 per cent.
The Danish krone came under little further pressure in European trading
after a hazardous day on Wednesday, when the Bank of Portugal was forced to
intervene in the market as the krone threatened to slip below its permitted
limit against the strongest currency, the escudo. By the end of European
trading, the krone was again firmly at the bottom of the EMS grid. But it
was more relaxed, with only a 5.74 percentage point differential against the
escudo, compared to 6.10 points on Wednesday.
The other EMS currency over which there is apprehension is the Italian lira,
the third weakest currency in the system. On Wednesday, the Bank of Italy
was reported to have intervened in the market to prevent the D-Mark rising
much above Lira 755.0. Yesterday, the lira again closed weaker at Lira 756.6
to the D-Mark, compared to a previous close of 756.1.
According to Mr Michael Feeny, senior dealer at Sumitomo Bank in London, the
lira is a potential concern. 'Italy's weak political system requires the
discipline of Maastricht to help the country take difficult decisions about
its growing budget deficit,' he said. 'Without Maastricht, overseas
investors' confidence could fail, prompting a real run on the lira. These
days, Italy no longer has the protection of controls on capital outflows.'

FT  05 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Short rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-DATED interest rates in the sterling cash markets were slightly softer
yesterday after the Bank of England forecast another small shortage in its
operations.
However, sterling futures still appeared to be reeling from the shock of
Denmark's vote on European Monetary Union (Emu), with the longer dated
contracts ending the day considerably lower than their previous close.
In the cash market, 1-month money ended the day at 9 7/8 per cent,  1/8 per
cent down on the previous night's close. 3-month Libor, an important
indicator of how the market thinks base rates will move, ended once again at
10 per cent. The rates for 6-month and 1-year money were also unchanged at
10 per cent and 9 15/16 per cent respectively.
The softening of rates followed the Bank of England's forecast of a shortage
of only Pounds 500m in the morning. This was later revised to Pounds 550m.
The Bank then purchased Pounds 550m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent,
taking out the shortage at one go in the morning.
Dealers said that a small shortage had once again removed the danger of the
cash markets over-reacting to the disarray over Emu. One dealer said: 'Any
potential fears that people may have had for the money markets have been
offset by the fact that money is cheap at the moment and prices have not
risen.' Another said that the Maastricht crisis had not changed his
perception that 10 per cent was a level from which base rates would come
down.
The Maastricht blues took a firmer grip of the sterling furtures markets,
however, where some of the longer-dated contracts ended the day a few ticks
lower. The June 1993 contract ended the day at 90.92, four ticks lower than
its previous close. This reflects the view that 3-month Libor will be at
9.08 per cent in one year's time. The September 1993 contract ended at
91.03, also down three ticks on the day. This reflects the view that 3-month
Libor will then be at 8.97 per cent.
There was little change in the shorter dated futures. The September contract
closed at 90.28, the same as its previous close.
Dealers said that the slight drop in longer-dated futures had mostly
reflected changes in the gilts market, where trading was far more active.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Russia seeks credits to boost
gas production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA IS set to boost its production of gas and of oil products by
returning to the Soviet method of attracting huge foreign credits for
investment in infrastructure.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian president, has signed a decree authorising the
state holding company Gasprom to raise up to Dollars 8.7bn in foreign
credits between 1992 and 1998. The hard currency earnings from gas exports
would be used to repay the debts.
Further decrees authorise the raising of unspecified amounts of credits for
investment in refineries and petrochemical plants. The official news agency
ITAR TASS said these decrees followed the appointment of Mr Victor
Chernomyrdin as the new energy minister, following the sacking of Mr
Vladimir Lopukhin from the post.
The decrees seem to indicate a turning away from a proposed strategy of
attracting foreign energy companies as partners and investors - instead
returning to the practice followed especially in the 1970s of borrowing
heavily from foreign banks and governments for industrial investments. The
credits raised will go to the refurbishing of pipelines and the construction
of new refineries. Oil refineries will be issued export quotas, the proceeds
from which will be used to repay the loans.
The total Soviet output of gas in 1991 was estimated at 810.5bn cubic
metres, or 40 per cent of the total world output. Much of that is exported
on long term contracts to Europe, especially to Germany.
Russia's share of the total last year was 642.9bn cu m, a slight rise on
previous years. The gas industry, which Mr Chernomyrdin headed as a Soviet
minister, has avoided the plunging output which has marked the oil sector.
However, in an effort to conserve supplies and to divert more to the export
market, Mr Yeltsin has also decreed that industrial consumers and power
stations will take a 10 per cent cut in gas supplies between June and
October of this year.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Food from Britain calls for
orchard aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT HELP in expanding British orchards in order to take up demand at
present satisfied by imported apples would reap rich rewards, according to a
report published yesterday.
Food from Britain, which promotes British products both at home and abroad,
said that the trade gap in fruit last year accounted for Pounds 1.7bn of the
Pounds 5.5bn food and drink trade deficit. While much of the imports are
accounted for by products such as bananas and citrus fruit, Pounds
500m-worth is accounted for by fruit that can be grown in the UK, and almost
half of it by apples.
The UK is only 45 per cent self sufficient in fruit that can be produced
here, and consumption is increasing. But investing in a new orchard is
risky, the report points out. Apples take several years to reach commercial
productivity after new plantings, giving a period of negative cash flows and
probably high borrowings. An added danger is that after five years the
chosen crop could have lost its appeal to consumers or been overtaken by
other market entrants.
However, the net return from the national deficit would be well above the
amount of investment needed if production was expanded. FFB believes an
investment of Pounds 100m would yield about Pounds 145m every year for at
least 10 years. If the government were prepared to give planting grants of
Pounds 30m over 13 years, or about Pounds 2.4m a year, the trade deficit in
apples over the lifetime of the new orchards would be reduced by almost
Pounds 1bn.
Mr Paul Judge, FFB chairman, called yesterday for a national strategy for
fruit. He suggested that a levy on all UK producers of between 1 and 2 per
cent of turnover would enable better promotion of their produce. He also
called for a reduction in the number of marketing organisations involved in
fruit. Most of the UK's 45 producer co-operatives had sales of less than
Pounds 5m, he pointed out, suggesting that only a handful had reached the
critical mass necessary to match the needs of supermarkets, which accounted
for almost half all fresh fruit sales.

Fund buying and short covering in LEAD took the three-month price on the LME
up through Pounds 310 a tonne, triggering buy stops and lifting the market
to a high of Pounds 317 before profit taking pared gains. Traders said there
appeared no fundamental reason for the rise. Prices are expected to drift
back to around Pounds 310 to probe for any follow-up buying to support the
rise. COPPER, after a brief period of consolidation following three-month
metal's recent break from the Dollars 2,230 to Dollars 2,240 a tonne range,
made further gains as Comex began to break through overhead resistance
levels. But a firmer pound against the dollar restrained the sterling price.
Three-month ZINC fluctuated narrowly around Dollars 1,255 a tonne during the
afternoon - a level which some traders said should be providing resistance,
having been broken as a support level on Wednesday. Traders said the driving
force remains the backwardation which ended the day up Dollars 19.50 at
Dollars 170. New York's July raw SUGAR price reached 10.22 cents a lb by
midday on strong fund buying, technical factors and talk of a pick up in
demand for white sugar. London sugar prices took heart from New York's
strength.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Italian call for CAP reform
delay refused
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR GUILIO Andreotti, Italy's caretaker prime minister, has received a dusty
reply to his request that ratification of last month's Common Agricultural
Policy reform be held up so that the Lisbon summit later this month can
discuss Italian milk quota demands.
Mr Andreotti wrote to Mr Jacques Delors, the European Commission president,
and Mr Anibal Cavaco Silva, prime minister of Portugal, the current EC
president on May 30, asking for the legal implementation of the CAP reform
to be taken off the agenda at the next agriculture ministers meeting on June
15-16.
At a time when the EC has been plunged into crisis by Denmark's rejection of
the Maastricht treaty, the Italian premier's veiled threat to invoke
national interest - the so-called 'Luxembourg compromise', whereby the rest
of the 12 would desist from forcing unacceptable measures on one of their
partners - over illicit milk output has caused great anger.
Approval of the radical reform, which took 18 months of negotiation, was
held up two weeks ago because Italy wanted to validate retrospectively the
2.5m tonnes of milk it produces in addition to its allotted quota. Farm
ministers voted the reform through over Italy's objections.
Mr Delors yesterday replied to Mr Andreotti's rather curt letter by saying
'this factor has nothing to do with the Lisbon summit. . . I know there is a
problem for Italy but this has got to be resolved in another place'.
Aides to Mr Ray MacSharry, agriculture commissioner and political architect
of the CAP reform, said 'farmers have already waited too long for CAP
reform. They need certainty and they need to start sowing in August'. Mr
Cavaco Silva has yet to reply formally, but is understood to be hostile to
any delay, particularly as the CAP package is the only sizeable feather in
the cap of the Portuguese presidency, which runs to the end of June.

THE SKr1.85bn offer of shares in SSAB, Sweden's state-controlled steel
company, has been oversubscribed among private and institutional investors,
it was announced yesterday.
The offer involves 126,666 units made up of government-guaranteed risk-free
bonds priced at SKr14,800 and redeemable in 1994 for SKr17,000. Under the
government's plan, 60,000 of the units have been offered to the general
public and these are over-subscribed.
Yesterday, it was announced that the share allocation for individuals would
be decided by lottery under the authorisation of an independent legal
authority with the stipulation that in the first instance nobody could
purchase more than one unit.
There has also been a large oversubscription among institutional investors
for the 60,000 units of shares allocated for them, with 15,000 reserved for
buyers from outside Sweden.
'The privatisation has been a great success, not just for SSAB but for our
whole privatisation programme', said Mr Per Westerberg, Sweden"s industry
minister. The company is the first of 35 separate privatisations that are
being planned over the next few years in Sweden's state industry sector.
Further information on SSAB's new shareholders will be made available in two
weeks. The government is selling 48 per cent of SSAB's equity and 60 per
cent of its voting rights.

<TEXT>
SAPPI, the South African paper and pulp group seeking to raise Dollars 250m
through a Euro-equity issue, is confident it has won considerable support
from European investors.
Mr Eugene van As, executive chairman, said yesterday he was confident the
group would achieve its target of placing at least half the issue abroad,
and perhaps do better.
The offer is the largest by a South African company since the lifting of
trade and investment sanctions.
The main aim of the issue is to finance Sappi's DM396.5m (Dollars 243.2m)
acquisition of Hannover Papier, a German fine paper group.
Mr van As said that although they would still have to 'see the colour of
everybody's money' - the issue is already massively oversubscribed with
demand so far coming from South African investors.
Mr Van As said his impression was that Sappi had been 'well received' while
investors remained cautious about South Africa. He said many fund managers
were still skittish about investing in South Africa for fear of criticism.
Many of the current generation of fund managers have also never bought a
South African stock.
Mr Richard Stuart of Martin, the stockbrokers who form part of the syndicate
managing the issue, said Sappi was a major cyclical share. With 65 per cent
of Sappi's earnings in hard currencies, the currency risk is considerably
diminished, he said.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation (AOTC), the dominant
participant in Australia's telecommunications duopoly, said it was entering
the competitive environment 'on the surest financial footing'.
AOTC was created in February through a merger of Australia Telecom, the
government-owned domestic carrier, and OTC, the government-owned
international carrier.
Under Australia's competitive telecommunications regime, the group will
compete with Optus Communications, a privately-owned corporation which
acquired the loss-making Aussat satellite company.
AOTC said OTC recorded 8 per cent growth in demand for services in the 10
months up to the merger, when it made a net profit of ADollars 260m
(USDollars 196.9m) on revenue of ADollars 1.4bn.
Telecom Australia made a trading profit of ADollars 1bn over the seven
months before the merger, but reported a loss of ADollars 204m after writing
off ADollars 1.2bn against asset value following a change of accounting
practice.
AOTC said the write-down was largely attributable to depreciation of the
Telecom exchange network. It said the write-down would not affect plans to
spend ADollars 40bn on capital investment over the next five years.
The company said it expected to make further 'comparatively small'
adjustments to asset values in its first financial report, which will cover
the five months from February to the end of June.

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: The rise and fall of Swiss
junk bonds - A spate of UK defaults has spread fresh gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE collapse of the junk bond market in Swiss francs, once one of the most
active debt markets for high-risk companies, has been confirmed by a spate
of defaults by UK companies, including the formal insolvency of the
Mountleigh property group.
The market had already been in the doldrums for several months because of
high interest rates and the weakness of the Swiss franc, but the latest
round of British corporate collapses has spread fresh gloom.
The rise of the Swiss franc bond market for high-risk foreign companies was
one of the stranger phenomena of the late 1980s. Until 1985, the Swiss
corporate bond market had been one of the safest in the world, with a
monopoly underwriting syndicate preventing all but the highest quality
issues from being launched.
Then the Swiss National Bank indicated that it would allow non-Swiss banks
to form underwriting syndicates, and the Geneva-based Soditic, then an
affiliate, now a subsidiary, of SG Warburg, the UK merchant bank, rushed in.
Over the next few years, Soditic brought a surprisingly large number of
foreign companies to the Swiss market, including some, such as Mountleigh,
Polly Peck and Bond Corporation of Australia, of obviously speculative
quality.
'Until Soditic set up its syndicates, Switzerland had the highest standards
in the world for bond issues. Now it has the second largest junk bond market
in the world,' one Zurich fund manager says.
The main attraction for the companies was a remarkably low cost of
borrowing. Soditic and others found that they could float unrated issues in
Switzerland with less than a 1 per cent premium over interest rates on blue
chip issues. A 1988 Polly Peck issue went at 5 3/4 per cent, a Maxwell
Communications issue at 5 per cent.
In the long years of a tightly-controlled market, Swiss bond buyers had
become accustomed to tiny differentials in coupon rates. Thus, when they saw
something bigger they were too thrilled to look too carefully at the health
warnings on the prospectuses.
Some criticise Soditic for exploiting this blind spot, but Mr Serge
Ledermann, of Geneva private bankers Lombard Odier, disagrees. 'I would not
throw any stones at them. They proceeded honestly. Fund managers have to do
their homework like everyone else.'
When the 1980s boom ended, the market was inevitably hit, and Soditic issues
have been prominent among the failures, including those of Bond Corporation,
Polly Peck, Heron Corporation and Mountleigh.
The latest victim is Trizec, a Canadian property company with close links to
Olympia &amp; York.
In the wake of the collapse of Olympia and York Developments in the UK,
Trizec's Swiss franc bonds plunged. A 1985 5 5/8 per cent issue due in 1995
slumped from SFr56 before the news to SFr40 on Friday, and a 1989 5 per cent
issue expiring in 1999 went from SFr45 to SFr30.
Dealers are reluctant to put too much blame on company collapses for the
sorry state of the market. The spread of less than 1 per cent between Swiss
and German interest rates is the main culprit, they say. 'We have never seen
that before,' one dealer said.
But there is a cumulative effect, especially as issuers default - something
hitherto unheard of in Switzerland.
Holders of bonds that have gone into default have been startled to find that
no one is obliged to represent their interests. There is no trustee function
under Swiss law.
Soditic and other lead managers have tried to be as helpful as they can, but
there are limits. 'We are on the creditors' committee of Polly Peck, but we
cannot vote because we have no mandate,' the Soditic official says.
The problem is intensified because most of the bonds are held by investors
who stuff their savings secretly into the Swiss private banks and do not
want to identify themselves.
It all spells bad news for the future of the market. 'It will be a long time
before anyone can float anything with less than a double A rating,' Franz
Ruegg of Bank Julius Baer in Zurich says.
Meanwhile, Soditic is now attracting attention for its moves on the Swiss
equity market rather than on the bond market.
Last week, it placed Swissair's 35.8 per cent stake in the travel agency
Kuoni, worth close to SFr120m, with institutions in Switzerland and
elsewhere in Europe.

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: Egyptian bankers baulk at fund
levy for BCCI unit

<TEXT>
EGYPT this week initiated a Dollars 300m bailout of the local subsidiary of
the failed Bank of Credit and Commerce International, but bankers in Cairo
have reacted testily to demands they foot part of the bill.
Dr Atef Sedki, the prime minister, announced in parliament that the
government planned to re-float Bank of Credit of Commerce Egypt (BCCM) with
an interest-free loan, part of which would come from a levy on bank
deposits.
A number of banks have yielded to demands for the payment of one-quarter of
1 per cent of their deposits to what the central bank is describing as a
'solidarity' fund to save BCCM, but the general manager of a large joint
venture bank said his institution had baulked. 'We are not running a
charity,' he declared.
Banks, which have reluctantly fallen into line, say they are still arguing
with the central bank over how the 'solidarity' payment should be
classified. Mr Hazem Beblawi, chairman of Export Development Bank of Egypt,
said he considered his bank's contribution 'a refundable deposit' with the
central bank.
BCCM activities were frozen last year after BCCI's collapse. The Egyptian
subsidiary, 49 per cent owned by BCCI, had some Dollars 375m of total
deposits of Dollars 600m with its parent. Egyptian shareholders held a 51
per cent stake in the bank.
The government has indicated that it plans to offer BCCI's stake for sale,
but local bankers are sceptical about BCCM's recovery. One senior Egyptian
banker said it was more likely that it would be taken over by an existing
institution.
Liquidators responsible for salvaging something from the BCCI wreckage - the
bank collapsed owing Dollars 14bn - say that depositors may receive a
payment of 30 to 40 per cent of their funds.
The government's attempts to unravel the BCCM tangle coincides with
parliament's approval this week of a new banking law that notionally
strengthens the central bank's regulatory capabilities.
But the original draft has been considerably watered down, and bankers doubt
that the central bank supervisory capabilities will be much changed by the
new law. The central bank had argued for a stronger hand at a time when
Egypt has entered a transition to a market-oriented economy in which local
financial institutions are expected to play a more adventurous role.
The banking law's main features include provision for a new deposit
insurance scheme and foreign currency branches of international banks will
be empowered to deal in local currency as a further step towards bolstering
the Egyptian pound's claims to be regarded as a freely-convertible currency
internationally.
Foreign currency branches would be obliged, however, to incorporate
themselves as fully-fledged banks locally if they wish to extend their
activities.
As one Egyptian official said: 'Branches cannot open additional branches.'
Mr Mohammed Hafez, chairman of Banque Misr, one of Egypt's 'big four' public
sector commercial banks, said it was hoped that the new banking law would
help facilitate mergers and acquisitions among Egypt's banks, some of which
have been struggling.
Bankers have long believed that Egypt is 'overbanked', and that a reduction
in the number of local financial institutions is desirable.

<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS is selling its 50 per cent stake in GMFanuc Robotics to
Fanuc, the large Japanese robotics company which is its partner in the
10-year-old joint venture.
The deal is the latest example of GM's new strategy of disposing of
peripheral businesses to concentrate on turning around its heavily
loss-making North American automotive operations.
Fanuc said it would be making a cash payment to GM but gave no details.
GMFanuc, which supplies GM and other industrial companies with robotic
systems for painting, welding and other manufacturing techniques, had sales
last year of over Dollars 250m.
It was established in 1982 at a time when Fanuc had little manufacturing
presence in the US and when GM was anxious to bring robotics technology to
its plants.
Fanuc now has several businesses in the US, including a joint venture with
General Electric which produces controllers for machine tools.
GMFanuc's present management will remain in place and the company, which
employs some 670 people, will continue to operate its sales, engineering and
assembly facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
Mr William Hoglund, GM's chief financial officer, said the company intended
to 'maintain our important relationship with GMFanuc as a GM supplier of
plant automation'. The sale is expected to be completed later this year.
In April, GM put up for sale its Allison gas turbine division,which employs
6,300 people and makes turbine engines for the aerospace, industrial and
marine markets.

<TEXT>
USAIR, the ailing US airline whose losses have topped Dollars 750m after tax
during the past two years, said it had secured wage concessions worth
Dollars 55m from its pilots over the next 12 months.
The carrier added that when a new four-year contract agreed with the Air
Line Pilots Association is fully implemented, annual savings should total
Dollars 100m.
USAir is among the most financially-fragile carriers in the US, although it
has stayed out of bankruptcy. Last autumn, it announced a plan designed to
cut operating costs by over Dollars 400m.
This involved progressive salary reductions for non-contract employees when
at least one of its three big unions agreed to do the same - a condition
fulfilled by the ALPA agreement. USAir executives agreed to take salary
reductions with effect from January 1, regardless of union actions.
The cost-savings, however, come as prospects for the US airline industry
remain bleak, with few analysts expecting it to show a profit this year. The
latest round of domestic fare competition has been intense, with travel
agents reporting computer 'crashes' as travellers scramble to secure cheap
fares before these expire.

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: IBM sets up offshoots to compete

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IBM has set up independent, wholly-owned subsidiaries in the UK and Canada
to sell low-cost personal computers that will compete directly with cheap
clones.
The new UK company, Individual Computer Products International, will market
a range of PCs under the Ambra brand name to target the low end of the
European market.
The Canadian subsidiary, ExperComp Services, will also offer the Ambra PC
products. UK prices will start under Pounds 1,000 (Dollars 1,800) while in
Canada Ambra PCs bundled with several software programs will sell for
CDollars 1,600 (USDollars 1,333). The first Ambra products will go on sale
in the UK today. In Canada, Ambra will make its debut in August.
The move reflects IBM's new willingness to break with past practices and
give its business units greater freedom to use innovative approaches to
increasing sales. 'Today's announcement is another step in our
transformation to a federation of focused business units,' said Mr Bill
Etherington, president and chief executive of IBM Canada.
Through the new units, IBM aims to gain entry to highly price-sensitive
segments of the PC market in which its own brand name products cannot
compete.
IBM is addressing this market on a country-by-country basis as PC prices,
distribution channels and buying patterns vary widely in different parts of
the world.
In the US, where PC clones are selling for well under Dollars 1,000 through
computer superstores, IBM may take a different approach. One option said to
be under consideration is to acquire an equity stake in an existing clone
manufacturer.
Many leading participants in the computer industry, including IBM, have seen
their PC market shares fall over the years in the face of fierce competition
from manufacturers of cheap clones.
'IBM saw a market place segment that had grown to significance in which they
did not participate,' said Mr Bill McCracken, general manager of IBM Europe
Personal Systems Business Unit, the parent company contact for the new
subsidiary. 'We want to be in that market place.'
In Europe, the bottom end of the market has been growing at about 45 per
cent compared with 21 per cent forecast for the entire computer market.
Rather than try to compete by launching a series of clones itself, IBM,
which already has a joint venture clone company in South East Asia, decided
it needed a separate company that would have the flexibility of a smaller
organisation and the benefits of a fresh corporate image.
Ambra products will be made in Asia by an unnamed third party supplier. They
will use 386 microprocessors manufactured by Advanced Micro Devices,
breaking with IBM's own close ties with Intel, the leading
microprocessor-maker.
The Ambra products will not be handled by IBM's own sales force, but will be
sold through dealers, retailers and direct response.

<TEXT>
JAPAN Air Lines, the Japanese international carrier which last month
announced a loss for the year to the end of March, yesterday unveiled a
cost-cutting and revenue-boosting programme.
By increasing income from domestic operations, JAL hopes by the 1996-97
financial year to increase net revenues by Y100bn (Dollars 782m) a year. It
is planning a Y25bn pre-tax profit in 1996-97.
The company, hit by the recession in the airline industry and the slowdown
in the Japanese economy, is halving to 250 the number of employees it plans
to recruit in Japan next year.
JAL is scrapping plans to hire 900 extra ground staff, the number of
managers will be cut by 50 to 500 and around 30 overseas posts will be axed.
However, the airline intends to continue hiring cockpit crew.
Overall, employment will still rise, albeit more slowly than planned - from
22,100 now to 23,600 in 1996. Other proposals include transferring some
administrative and maintenance work overseas.
At the same time, JAL plans to increase its share in the lucrative Japanese
domestic market from 24 per cent to around one-third. It wants domestic
revenues to increase from 24 per cent to 30 per cent of total revenues and
intends to expand its network and to increase the frequency of flights.

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: Czech deal with clear
attractions - Glaverbel's glass-making venture with Sklo Union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GLAVERBEL, the Belgian-based glass company controlled by Asahi Glass of
Japan, is pleased with its pioneering decision in 1990 to invest in a joint
venture with Sklo Union, Czechoslovakia's largest glass company. The move
has given it a significant advantage in the highly competitive European
glass market.
Since Glaverbel's decision to invest an initial Dollars 48m in a 40 per cent
stake in the joint venture - known as Glavunion - more than 1,500 workers
have been shed from the original workforce of 4,900. Over the same period,
production of plate, vehicle and mirror glass has risen by over 25 per cent.
Exports to western markets, which already accounted for 40 per cent of Sklo
Union's sales before the joint venture, have risen to 65 per cent.
Production from Glavunion's plants in Teplice, northern Bohemia, has found
new outlets through Glaverbel's existing European sales network.
In addition, sales into the depressed domestic market have also been
revitalised through the establishment of a new privatised retail and
distribution network with 14 outlets across the republic.
Glavunion's energy, raw material and labour costs are all 'significantly'
lower than in Glaverbel's west European plants and those of its main rivals
 -St Gobain of France, Pilkington of the UK and Guardian Glass of the US,
according to Mr Stepan Popovic, managing director of the joint venture.
These factors, and Teplice's location only 60km from Dresden, are clear
advantages in supplying the booming construction market in eastern Germany.
Specific German investments in Czechoslovakia, such as Volkswagen's plans to
expand production at Skoda, the Czechoslovak carmaker, have also prompted
Glaverbel to boost output of vehicle glass.
The company currently delivers 200,000 glass sets a year to VW-Skoda and
expects to double this within two to three years. At the same time,
Glavunion recently elbowed aside St Gobain to win what Mr Popovic would only
describe as a contract 'to supply a substantial and rising volume' of
vehicle glass to Fiat in Italy.
The experience of Glavunion reflects the attraction of Czechoslovakia as a
relatively cheap and efficient production base for sales to European
Community markets. Provided this weekend's general elections offer a
reasonable chance of continuing political stability, foreign investment
bankers and advisers there believe several billion dollars of foreign
investment is forthcoming.
Encouraged by early signs of progress, Glaverbel decided to speed up its
original investment timetable. It raised its stake from 40 to 51 per cent
last July, and paid another Dollars 32.4m to raise its shareholding to 67
per cent on June 1, bringing its total equity investment to Dollars 80.4m.
Four per cent of Glavunion's shares are reserved for employees, while the
remaining 29 per cent shares are held by Sklo Union, still a 100 per cent
state-owned enterprise.
This will change shortly, however, as 61.5 per cent of the shares in Sklo
Union have been submitted for the 'first wave' of the mass privatisation
scheme under which shares in 900 Czech and Slovak enterprises will be
available for purchase through special vouchers. These have been taken up by
8.5m Czech and Slovak citizens.
Along with other Czech banks and enterprises, Sklo Union and Glavunion
decided to set up their own investment fund in a 50-50 joint venture with a
private entrepreneur. The fund, called First Privatisation Fund, attracted
117,000 voucher booklets from individuals willing to leave investment
decisions to the fund managers. The fund will invest the vouchers in some 70
companies, including Sklo Union.
Glavunion's emergence as the jewel in the Sklo Union crown has left Czech
senior management full of praise for Glaverbel's managerial style.
Contrary to earlier fears, the company was able to shed 1,500 workers
without strikes or protests. 'We closed down one old fashioned sheet glass
plant employing 300; privatised our wooden box manufacture, transport and
maintainance divisions; and asked for voluntary retirements. But those who
were made redundant have found jobs in the fast-growing private sector,'
said Mr Popovic.
For those who remain, pay and conditions have improved. The head office
currently reverberates with the sound of pneumatic drills as workers rebuild
the building's toilets. 'In a way the dirty, stinking toilets symbolised the
basic contempt for people under the old communist regime. I vowed that one
of our priorities would be to make decent toilets both in the offices and
the plant.'
The biggest problem inherited from the old regime, according to Mr Popovic,
is the difficulty of finding bright people capable of thinking in a
market-oriented way. 'We have just employed two plant directors in their
early 30s, and in future will only take on people straight from university.
We will send them to gain experience at Glaverbel plants in Benelux and
Canada and only then will we set them to work here.'

AHOLD, the Dutch food retailer which generates about half of its sales in
the US, said net profit had risen by 11.5 per cent to Fl 85.1m (Dollars
47.2m) in the first quarter of 1992.
Operating profit showed a significantly stronger rise than net profit,
increasing 25.7 per cent to Fl 146.5m.
Growth in net profit was held back by a sharp increase in financing charges,
reflecting Ahold's acquisition last year of Tops Markets, the New York-based
supermarket chain.
Financial charges nearly trebled to Fl 34.4m from Fl 12.2m in the same
period a year earlier.
Last month, Ahold reported that first-quarter sales had surged by 22.1 per
cent to Fl 6.7bn, boosted partly by the contribution of Tops, the Dutch
company's fourth supermarket chain in the eastern part of the US.
In the first quarter, the US chains BI-LO and Giant Food Stores had produced
'satisfactory' sales rises, Ahold said. However, the First National chain,
with outlets in the recession-ridden New England states, saw only a slight
rise in sales.
Operating profit rose by 6.9 per cent in the Netherlands, where Ahold owns
the Albert Heijn supermarket chain, the market leader.
In the US, operating profits jumped by 40.3 per cent after the first-time
consolidation of Tops. Excluding Ahold's latest acquisition, US operating
profit was up 6.5 per cent in the first quarter.
Ahold, which released the profit figures after the close of stock market
trading, repeated earlier predictions that full-year results would show
further growth.
VNU, the largest publisher of consumer magazines in the Netherlands and
Belgium, has taken a 51 per cent stake in Mona, the biggest publisher of
women's magazines in Czechoslovakia.
The company also acquired an option to buy the rest of the shares in 1993.
No terms were given.
Mona, based in Prague, publishes four women's magazines including Vlasta,
the Czechoslovak market leader with a circulation of 400,000.
The three other magazines have circulations ranging from 80,000 to 300,000
copies.
VNU, which is based in the Netherlands, is concentrating its eastern
European expansion on Russia, Hungary and Czechoslovakia.
In November, VNU entered a joint venture with ILK, a Hungarian publisher, in
the field of crossword puzzle magazines and magazines aimed at teenage
girls.
VNU was also involved in the establishment of two English-language titles in
Russia - Moscow Magazine and Moscow Guardian.

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: KLM back in black after record
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RONALD VAN DE KROL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KLM ROYAL Dutch Airlines swung back into profit in 1991-92 after record
losses in the previous 12 months. The return to the black has prompted the
airline to resume dividend payments.
A cost-cutting programme and a higher proportion of first-class and
business-class travellers helped KLM post a net profit of Fl 125m (Dollars
69m) in the year to the end of March. In the previous year, KLM recorded net
losses of Fl 630m, nearly half of which were due to restructuring charges.
The airline, which is 38 per cent state-owned, is to pay a dividend of Fl 1
a share. It last paid a dividend two years ago, when shareholders received
Fl 1.80.
'Though 1991 was a bad year for the international airline industry, KLM
achieved 7 per cent traffic growth in 1991-92,' the company said.
Other factors behind the improvement were a 9 per cent increase in
productivity and a 7 per cent decline in fuel expenses. The company also
attributed the upturn to its pruning of unprofitable services and a trend
towards more long-haul flights.
The Dutch airline made no mention of the collapse of merger talks with
British Airways in February. However, KLM has said that it remains
interested in pursuing global partnerships, though it stresses that it is
under no time pressure to strike a deal.
The results, which were in line with analysts' forecasts, include book
profits of Fl 61m on the disposal of older aircraft and extraordinary gains
of Fl 48m, reflecting the sale of a 49 per cent stake in its helicopter
subsidiary and several other transactions.
Operating profits totalled Fl 416m, reversing the previous year's losses of
Fl 285m. However, financing charges rose by more than 50 per cent to Fl
253m, while holdings in non-Dutch airlines - Northwest of the US, Air
Littoral of France and Air UK - continued to generate substantial losses of
Fl 145m, little changed from the year before.
Total turnover rose by 21 per cent to Fl 7.91bn. Traffic revenue was up 18
per cent, excluding Transavia, the charter airline, and Air Littoral, both
of which were consolidated for the first time.
The revenue increase reflected both a 7 per cent rise in traffic as well as
a 10 per cent increase in yields generated mainly by higher-fare passengers.
Costs - up 10 per cent at Fl 7.49bn - rose less than half as fast as
turnover.

FT  05 JUN 92 / International Company News: Nestle's bid for Perrier gives
rise to cartel doubts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NESTLE, the Swiss food multinational, yesterday revealed that European
Commission anti-cartel investigators are challenging its FFr15.46bn
(USDollars 2.8bn) bid for Perrier, the French supplier of mineral water.
A preliminary finding by a commission task force 'raised serious doubts' on
the grounds that it thought the bid created a duopoly of Nestle and BSN, the
French food group, on the French mineral water market, said Mr
Francois-Xavier Perroud, spokesman for the Swiss group.
"We have a good case and remain optimistic,' said Mr Perroud, who said
Nestle would contest the task force on every point.
Nestle had already pledged to sell Volvic, one of Perrier's brands, to BSN
to avoid monopoly problems and to obtain the French group's support in the
battle for Perrier against Italy's Agnelli family, the rival bidders.
Nestle's bid was suspended in late March when the commission opened a formal
inquiry - which it only does if it already has doubts - to last until the
end of July. If the task force finds against Nestle, a full meeting of the
17 commissioners will then decide whether to veto the deal or demand
changes.
Brussels has the right to ask Nestle to sell other mineral water brands to
reduce its market share. The Perrier purchase also includes the
Contrexeville and Vichy brands.
Nestle believes that the bid will raise its share of French mineral water
sales from 15.6 per cent to 36.8 per cent and BSN's market share from 20.2
per cent to 30.9 per cent.
The remainder is still held by France's powerful supermarket chains, with an
unchanged 32.3 per cent, according to a study for the group by Canadean, the
UK drinks industry consultancy. The task force finding ignores the
supermarkets' competitive power, said Mr Perroud.
Earlier, Mr Serge Milhaud, head of Nestle's mineral water division, told a
French newspaper the task force had failed to take into account the overall
European Community market, of which Nestle plus Perrier had a mere 14.3 per
cent share. The news sent both companies' share prices down 0.9 per cent to
FFr36,100 for Nestle and FFr1,091 for BSN.
Apart from the agreement to sell Volvic, there was no other link in France
between Nestle and BSN, which remained fierce competitors there, said Mr
Perroud.
The commission task force's worries contrast with the neutrality of a French
government, which has sometimes been known in the past to rush to the
defence of embattled French companies. Perrier's fate appears to invite no
national industrial policy interest, in contrast to Aerospatiale's bid for
de Havilland, the Canadian aircraft group, which the commission blocked last
year, provoking widespread outrage in France.

<TEXT>
EURO DISNEY, which seven weeks ago opened its new Euro Disneyland theme park
outside Paris as Europe's most expensive leisure complex, is postponing the
opening of the second phase of the park for a year until 1996 and is
developing plans to try to improve attendance levels.
The group is reverting to its original plan to open the park's second phase
in 1996 for 'technical reasons'. A year ago it decided to bring the opening
forward.
Euro Disney, which has been dogged by unconfirmed rumours of poor attendance
since the opening, made an operating loss of FFr80,000 (Dollars 14,732) on
sales of FFr3.07bn in the six months to March 31. It said yesterday that
'because of operational uncertainties' it could not say whether it would
become profitable in the present financial year.
Euro Disney refused to disclose specific budgets or attendance targets
before the theme park's opening on April 12.
However, the company yesterday confirmed that more than 1.5m people have
visited the park since the opening night. Euro Disney would not say whether
this level of attendance conformed with its original expectations. It said
it 'needed a full year of operation' before any reasonable assessment of its
performance could be made.
In a downbeat statement Euro Disney said that attendance at the park, and
the occupancy of its hotels, had 'fluctuated considerably'.
Euro Disney noted that attendance during the weekends and holidays had
'significantly exceeded' mid-week levels. It also claimed that prospective
French visitors had been deterred by 'misleading reports of traffic jams and
over-crowding'.
Euro Disney, which last weekend ran a lavish series of special advertising
supplements in the European press, is considering plans to increase
attendance in off-peak periods, during the week and from within France.

<TEXT>
MARSTON, Thompson &amp; Evershed, the Burton-on-Trent-based brewer, yesterday
announced a reciprocal beer distribution agreement with Courage, its fifth
such alliance in the past month, writes Philip Rawstorne.
From mid-July, Marston will add a range of Courage lagers and Beamish Irish
stout to its range. It will also distribute the leading Courage ale, John
Smith's Bitter, in the Midlands and north-west. Courage will add Pedigree
premium cask-conditioned ale and Low C, the lower calorie bottled beer, to
its portfolio.
Marston, in which the Whitbread Investment Company has yet to reduce its
31.4 per cent shareholding to comply with the government beer orders, has
already signed similar deals with Wolverhampton &amp; Dudley, Scottish &amp;
Newcastle, Allied, and Bass.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Tiles cost-cutting helps lift Norcros to
Pounds 15.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BENEFITS of cost cutting in its ceramic tile factories helped to offset
a sharp deterioration in windows and doors at Norcros last year.
Pre-tax profit rose 4 per cent to Pounds 15.6m (Pounds 15m) on reduced
turnover of Pounds 394m (Pounds 425m) in the 12 months to March 31. A
decline of 7 per cent in operating profit to Pounds 24.3m (Pounds 26.2m) was
outweighed by reductions in exceptional charges and interest costs.
The better-than-feared results and hopes of further progress helped the
share price gain 17p to close at 148p. A maintained final dividend of 3.5p
leaves the total unchanged at 7p, just covered by earnings per share of 7.5p
(7p).
Mr Michael Doherty, chief executive, said: 'We have completed our
restructuring and now we are going to start growing.' Operating profit per
employee had risen by 11 per cent.
In ceramics, including Johnson tiles in Stoke-on-Trent where 1,500 jobs have
been shed, operating profit rebounded by 74 per cent to Pounds 11.4m (Pounds
6.53m) on sales of Pounds 121m (Pounds 118m). Apart from a 30 per cent
profit improvement in the UK, there were turnrounds in Australia and South
Africa.
Profits also advanced in print and packaging, where the group is involved in
niches such as films and tickets. The division made Pounds 12m (Pounds
10.4m) on sales of Pounds 98.6m (Pounds 97.2m).
But building products profit fell by nearly Pounds 10m to Pounds 3.56m on
sales of Pounds 156m (Pounds 184m).
Mr Robert Alcock, finance director, said the big disappointments were Crosby
Sarek, the windows and doors maker, which incurred a 'significant' loss, and
Crittall Windows, which fell into the red. These had wiped out good
performances from Triton showers and Crosby kitchens.
Gearing remained high at 91 per cent on net debt of about Pounds 128m
(Pounds 147m). More than Pounds 17m had come in from property sales, with a
further Pounds 22.5m since the year-end. Mr Alcock said a Pounds 60m
portfolio remained - most of it should be sold this year.
Meanwhile the activity has been shoved below the line, making it the main
contributor to a Pounds 4.69m extraordinary charge.
COMMENT
A big sigh of relief was heaved yesterday at evidence that the expensive
years of closing factories, shedding workers and capital spending were over
and that some benefits were at last coming through. However, the slide in
building products showed that cutting costs is not a panacea. Crosby Sarek
still needs a 10 per cent volume increase to break even. With further
benefits to come from cost-cutting and lower interest payments, even a small
pick-up in demand should send this year's pre-tax profit to between Pounds
20m and Pounds 25m. In spite of yesterday's rally, the prospective p/e of
roughly 15 is lower than many recovery stocks in the building materials
sector, and the print and packaging wing is no detraction. But excitement
about recovery prospects should be tempered by the property portfolio and
the related high gearing; and by some caution about the outlook for house
building and, even more so, for commercial building. Supported by a 6.3 per
cent yield, the price should have a bit more room for improvement.

acquisition

<TEXT>
IWP International, the Irish industrial holding company, reported pre-tax
profits ahead 19 per cent, from IPounds 9.2m to IPounds 11m (Pounds 10m),
for the year to March 31. Turnover rose 3.6 per cent to IPounds 92.6m.
The company was originally a wire and fastenings manufacturer, but following
reorganisation in 1987 and a rapid series of acquisitions, diversified into
printing and packaging, telecommunications and household product manufacture
which included firelighters, air fresheners and disinfectants.
A new management team brought in 1990 put a halt to the acquisition
programme in order to consolidate the company and get its financial
structure under control.
Mr Joe Moran, chairman and chief executive, said the outcome was a result of
that reorganisation, which has brought gearing down from 129.6 per cent two
years ago to the current 36.5 per cent and seen IPounds 6.5m invested in
manufacturing plants over the same period.
He said that in consequence the group's product lines have dropped in price
over the past year, but margins and turnover have increased.
The group was now ready to make a substantial new acquisition 'either in
household products or in printing and packaging' which he said would be a
'strategic add-on business'.
Earnings per share rose 16 per cent to 28.1p (24.3p) and a recommended final
dividend of 3.85p makes an increased total of 6.6p (6p).

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Morland spurns Pounds 101m Greene King
offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORLAND, the Thames Valley regional brewer, yesterday flatly rejected the
Pounds 101m takeover bid from Greene King, the East Anglia-based brewer, as
'an opportunistic attempt . . . to acquire Morland on the cheap.'
Sir Humphrey Prideaux, Morland's chairman, urged shareholders not to be
pressured into accepting Greene King's paper offer of 477p a share or the
cash alternative of 450p. 'We have no doubt that the bid undervalues your
company,' he said.
Sir Humphrey accused Greene King of trying to take advantage of Whitbread
Investment Company's enforced disposal of its 43.4 per cent shareholding to
comply with the government's beer orders.
WIC had sold Greene King a 28.5 per cent holding and pledged its 14.9 per
cent balance - but price had been 'a secondary consideration,' Sir Humphrey
said, and other shareholders had no reason to sell on the same terms.
Greene King's offer document had attempted to mislead shareholders on
Morland's performance and prospects, he charged. 'In fact, we have an
excellent financial record and a sound and proven strategy.'
Over the past five years, Morland's pre-tax profits had grown by 18.9 per
cent a year - 'well over twice as fast as Greene King.'
Earnings per share had grown at a compound rate of 17 per cent a year - 'the
best record of all the major regional brewers and pub operators.'
Dividends per share had grown at 16.6 per cent a year compared to Greene
King's 11.7 per cent.
Taunting Greene King with its failure to forecast its profits for the year
to May 3, Sir Humphrey asked: 'Does it have something to hide? Are its
profits up to market expectations?
Mr Simon Redman, Greene King's chairman, said last night: 'We have nothing
to hide. We have issued a full statement about current trading and a final
dividend forecast.'
Morland had not attempted to deny the commercial logic of acquisition by
Greene King, he said. Morland's profit record was no guide to its future in
a beer industry that was changing fundamentally.
Suggestions that Morland had strategic difficulties in coping with changes
in the industry were dismissed as 'nonsense' by Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, chief
executive.
Morland's brewery made a significant contribution to group profits and was
producing ale more cheaply than it could be bought on the open market, he
claimed. Distribution deals with national brewers had opened new markets for
its ales; free trade sales had increased 54 per cent in the past two years.
Greene King had admitted that Morland had 'a good quality' pub estate, and
talks on further acquisitions were being held, Mr Clutterbuck said.
With gearing of only 8.1 per cent - compared to Greene King's 42 per cent -
and cash deposits of more than Pounds 9m, Morland was well-positioned to
take advantage of opportunities arising from the industry upheavals caused
by the beer orders.

Whitbread, the brewing and retailing group, is to lease 174 pubs, free of
tied beer supplies, to Brent Walker's Pubmaster estate, writes Philip
Rawstorne.
The deal increases the Pubmaster estate to nearly 2,000 pubs and leaves
Whitbread with only another 550 pubs to free from the tie in the next five
months to comply with the government's beer orders.
Whitbread has sold more than 1,000 pubs and leased a further 800 in the past
three years. The pubs leased to Pubmaster are mainly in north-west England,
Gloucestershire, and Kent.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Country Casuals seeks SE listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNTRY CASUALS Holdings, a women's clothing manufacturer, yesterday joined
the growing number of companies seeking a quotation on the Stock Exchange.
The company, a 1989 management buy-in to the clothing chain previously owned
by Coats Viyella, is hoping to raise about Pounds 11m through a placement on
June 17 giving it a market capitalisation of between Pounds 20-Pounds 25m.
In the year to January 25, it made pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.01m, more
than double the previous year, on sales up 15 per cent at Pounds 36m (Pounds
31.3m).
Mr John Shannon, chairman and one of the three managers who paid Pounds
12.5m for the business, said the brand had been revived despite the
recession. This had been achieved via a strategy based on changes to the
design philosophy, the planning and production of the clothing range, the
imposition of tight management controls and employee motivation.
Continued progress would come via increased market share by raising the
number of outlets from the current 155 and through a new casual wear line
aimed at a broader market.
Country Casuals has already paid off most of the senior debt it borrowed
from the Bank of Scotland and is now broadly cash neutral. About Pounds 2.7m
of preference shares need to be redeemed.
Management put in Pounds 150,000 of the Pounds 2.85m capital, with the
balance provided by Invesco MIM, County NatWest Ventures and 3i, the venture
capital group owned by the high street banks.
After the flotation the buy-in team will have 30 per cent of the company.
Morgan Grenfell is sponsoring the placement and the brokers are County
NatWest.
Mr Shannon said he would be interested in acquiring another retail brand and
applying the same strategy as that which had turned Country Casuals around.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Placing values Vega at Pounds 17.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the smallest stock market flotations of the year was completed
successfully yesterday with a placing of shares in Vega Group, a space
industry consultancy.
A history of strong growth allowed the shares to be placed at 122p, a p/e
ratio of 18.35 on notional earnings per share for the year to March 31 1992
of 6.65p.
Turnover increased from Pounds 1.9m to Pounds 6.3m between 1988 and 1992,
with pre-tax profits rising from Pounds 286,000 to Pounds 1.4m over the same
period.
At the placing price the company will have a market capitalisation of Pounds
17.2m with an estimated gross dividend yield of 2.5 per cent.
Dealings in the shares are due to begin on June 11.
The sponsor, Beeson Gregory, placed 4.37m shares - 31 per cent - with
institutional and private investors to raise Pounds 5.33m for existing
shareholders. No new money goes to the company which said the placing was
more than three times oversubscribed.
Directors said that a public quotation would help the company secure new
orders and would improve staff incent-ives.
Directors will keep 42.8 per cent of the share capital and have undertaken
not to sell any shares until after the publication of the 1993 results.
More than half the employees will hold a further 6.3 per cent.
The company was started in 1978, with Mr John Rigg, chairman, and Mr Chris
Duckworth, finance director, joining in 1989.
It is organised into four divisions: operations engineering, software,
systems engineering and dynamics and control. There are 122 staff, of which
107 are technical. Their work is in software and systems for ground services
and in-orbit operations.
Its biggest customer is the European Space Agency, which has a budget of
Pounds 2bn a year to build and launch non-defence satellites.
Contracts usually last for the life of a satellite, about 10 years. The
company has an order book of 'over Pounds 16.7m'.
Vega has just secured a Pounds 1m Ministry of Defence contract in the area
of battlefield command and control and said there could be further expansion
outside the space industry.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Quiligotti sells US arm and calls for
Pounds 3.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUILIGOTTI, the USM-quoted maker and installer of terrazzo floors, is
selling its loss-making US subsidiary and raising Pounds 3.2m in a rights
issue.
The new management, which bought into the company last September, also
warned that it had lost about Pounds 1.8m pre-tax in the year to March 31,
compared with a Pounds 910,000 profit in 1990-91. There would be no final
dividend. The interim was also passed.
Mr Roy Jenkins, chief executive, said: 'People worried about Quiligotti for
two reasons - America and high debt - and those two reasons have gone away.'
The US business, which incurred a trading loss of about Pounds 1.5m last
year, is being sold for Dollars 580,000 (Pounds 333,000) to JWB Capital
Group, of Texas. A near Pounds 3m write-off on the disposal will be treated
as an extraordinary item.
Mr Jenkins said that although the UK business made a trading profit of about
Pounds 700,000, the 1991-92 pre-tax loss had been pushed up to Pounds 1.8m
by more than Pounds 500,000 of provisions for old contracts, plus
rationalisation costs and interest payments.
The 3-for-2 rights issue at 8p a share would raise Pounds 3.2m and reduce
net debt of Pounds 4.5m. Gearing would come down from more than 100 per cent
to less than 50 per cent.
The group, which supplies flooring for supermarkets, airports and stations,
was developing new ceramic, marble and granite-based products to try to
increase its share of hard flooring markets.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Anglian Water raises dividend by 10%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLIAN WATER, regarded as one of the most cautious of the 10 privatised
water companies, yesterday adopted a more aggressive dividend policy with a
proposed 10 per cent increase in dividends for the year to March 31.
The company is recommending a final of 13p to make a total of 19.3p (17.5p).
The rise gives real growth of 5.3 per cent making Anglian the first of the
water companies to depart significantly from the assumption of 4 per cent
real growth agreed during the 1989 privatisation. Earnings per share grew 13
per cent to 51.7p (45.9p).
The shares gained 8p to 437p as the stock enjoyed a partial re-rating.
Mr Bernard Henderson, chairman, said the increase was a reward for
shareholders and followed improvements in customer service.
But the decision may prompt another reprimand from the Office of Water
Services, the water regulator, which last year warned that dividend
increases should not be higher than for the stock market generally. This
view was rejected by the water companies.
Pre-tax profits increased 12 per cent from Pounds 152.6m to Pounds 171.3m.
'It's been a good year and we're in excellent shape,' Mr Henderson said.
Turnover advanced by 14 per cent to Pounds 523.1m (Pounds 460.6m), mainly
due to price increases of 15.2 per cent. However, the sion among industrial
customers. Increases this year will be lower at 9.4 per cent, but Anglian's
prices remain among the highest in the country.
Operating expenses increased 12 per cent to Pounds 241.4m, mainly due to
inflation and increased standards. Depreciation was 18 per cent higher at
Pounds 45.6m (Pounds 38.8m), reflecting the increased capital expenditure
programme to improve sewerage, water quality and beach quality.
Capital expenditure and infrastructural renewals rose 29 per cent to Pounds
294.9m. Mr Chris Mellor, finance director, said spending would rise another
Pounds 50m to Pounds 345m this year.
Net borrowings, which rose from Pounds 194.7m to Pounds 303.8m during the
year, will increase again and gearing is set to rise from 18 per cent at the
year end to 23 per cent, he said.
At the interim stage Anglian reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 91.9m on
sales of Pounds 261m.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Richmond reveals loss of Pounds 37m project
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RICHMOND Oil and Gas, the US natural resources group which is quoted in
London, insisted yesterday that it was still solvent despite losing its most
significant development, resulting in a substantial reduction in its balance
sheet.
The group announced that lenders Johnson Ranch Partners had foreclosed on
the company's interest in the Richmond Ranch oil and gas field in Texas.
This will mean a net reduction in group assets of about Pounds 37m. At March
31 1991, the date of the latest available audited balance sheet, Richmond
had net assets of Pounds 49.7m.
The shares lost 3p to close at 8p yesterday, compared with a high of 173p in
1990.
Mr David Wilkinson, joint managing director, said the directors believed
that the value of Richmond's interest inRichmond Ranch had fallen below the
amount of indebtedness against which it was secured. It was therefore 'very
unlikely' to take up an exclusive option granted by Johnson Ranch Partners
to re-purchase Richmond Ranch within 15 days, if refinancing could be
arranged.
Richmond acquired the Richmond Ranch field for Dollars 33m (Pounds 18.3m)
cash and assumed Dollars 51m debt in October 1989, when it was hailed as the
company's most significant asset. However, the combination of a virtual
halving in the US gas price, which drastically affected returns, and cost
overruns at the drilling stage meant that the project never fulfilled its
promise.
Mr Wilkinson pointed out that the group now had no borrowings and outlined
four factors which he believed could reverse the group's fortunes:
Firstly, it is selling the Lone Star Royalty Corporation, acquired in 1990,
for Dollars 750,000.
A lawsuit which prevented completion of the sale ofRichmond's San Juan Basin
Coal Bed Methane properties in September 1991 has also been settled.
Richmond, which had received only Dollars 12.6m of an expected Dollars 20m
before the lawsuit was served, is now holding discussions with potential
purchasers of the balance of the New Mexico and Colorado properties.
Most significantly, Richmond is negotiating with joint venture partner
American Hunter Exploration to increase its 25 per cent interest in the
Jicarilla Apache Tribal Lands field in New Mexico to 40 per cent. The
agreement would cover two producing wells, and a proposed five-fold increase
in the acreage.
The company also revealed yesterday that it is awaitingregistration of an
agreement to form a Russian joint venture with Krasnoleninsk Oil and Gas in
western Siberia.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Dart Group, the Dorset-based aviation services and forwarding and
distribution company, achieved a modest increase in profits for the 12
months to end-March.
After almost doubled interest charges of Pounds 256,000 (Pounds 133,000),
pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 1.88m, up from Pounds 1.8m last time.
Mr Philip Meeson, chairman, said the small growth reflected pressure on
margins throughout the group's activities, especially in the second six
months. Progress in the current year would be 'steady rather than
spectacular'.
Turnover improved 15 per cent to Pounds 37.4m (Pounds 32.4m). A proposed
increased final dividend of 2p, makes a total of 3.3p (3p), payable from
earnings of 9.4p (9.7p) per share.

sold a building in the City of London to Scottish Amicable Life Assurance
for Pounds 19.1m.
The 46,000 sq ft office building, St Clement's House in Clement's Lane, is
let to Standard Chartered Bank.
There is a provision for a further payment to Greycoat in June 1995,
dependent on the value of the building at that time.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: TI buys 10% as Dowty bid nears close
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI GROUP, the specialist engineer, yesterday paid 189p a share for 10 per
cent of Dowty, the aerospace and information technology group that it is
pursuing via a hostile Pounds 525.7m bid.
The shares purchase, made only four days before the offer closes, increases
the chances that Dowty will lose its independence, particularly as brokers
were able to buy the stake relatively quickly.
'We are extremely pleased with today's market operation, which underlines
our confidence in the successful outcome of the bid,' TI said.
Dowty dismissed the purchase, saying: 'This 10 per cent we knew we were
going to lose, but they have had to pay an incredibly high price.'
TI paid about 14p above the 175p per share value of the cash alternative to
the 4-for-15 share offer, currently worth 193p.
In its latest letter to shareholders, TI stressed that the key issue in the
last days of the bid was which of the two companies' managements was best
suited to set and execute the correct strategy for Dowty.
Mr Christopher Lewinton, TI chairman, also questioned Dowty's ability to
turn the corner.
'I suspect that many shareholders had lost money on their Dowty shares
before TI made its bid.' he said. 'Now they should ask themselves whether
they believe Dowty's hollow promises or TI's solid record of creating
shareholder value.'
Dowty has consistently said that it is about to make a strong recovery after
recession hit years and the mistake of moving into information technology.
Contrary to what TI might claim, significant costs had already been taken
out of the business and shareholders, faced with a 7 per cent yield on their
shares and the genuine prospect of recovery, should stay with the existing
management, Dowty said.
Shares in TI added 7p yesterday to 364p and its target's price rose 6p to
182p.

BRITISH RETAIL investors are being offered some favours in the Wellcome
share sale, although nothing like those now usual in privatisations.
They will have to pay the same price as large investors, buy at least Pounds
1,000 worth and pay in one instalment.
Shareholders on the Wellcome register on June 15 and with addresses in the
UK will be sent blue forms giving them priority if they apply for up to
Pounds 5,000 worth of shares. They can also buy shares in the general offer.
Otherwise, UK investors can apply either on application forms or through
retail selling agents. A number of shares will be reserved for the UK
market, with a limit of Pounds 100,000 per applicant. Shareholders can apply
through a personal equity plan or transfer shares bought in the offer to a
Pep, to take advantage of the tax concessions of Peps.
A share information office opened yesterday. The telephone number is 081 944
1242.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome prospectus stresses core
pharmaceutical business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'pink herring' prospectus published yesterday by Wellcome stressed how
senior management have concentrated on core pharmaceutical operations in
recent years. Businesses involved in animal healthcare, industrial hygiene,
human vaccines and environmental health have all been sold during the last
two years.
The company emphasised the importance of its over-the-counter (OTC)
operations, adding that the long-term growth of that business was one of the
group's strategic aims. The company was 'actively exploring the possibility
of substantial OTC joint venture arrangements.' It wanted to sell its
existing products in new markets, particularly on the continent.
The prospectus also set out how the company had adopted a more marketing-led
approach to research and development. It wasincreasingly focusing on drugs
which 'enhance the competitive standing of the company as well as promoting
human health and quality of life.' In addition, the marketing department now
had far closer ties with the research departments. The aim is to ensure
rapid and successful product launches.
The more commercial approach in sales and marketing was also highlighted in
the document, as was the increased emphasis on financial returns. The
company particularly mentioned it wanted to improve margins through
cost-savings.
The prospectus warned, however, of the increasingly difficult environment
for pharmaceuticals companies, particularly in the area of pricing. It
pointed out that France, Italy and Spain were all considering new pricing
and reimbursement bills. Meanwhile, in the US, the company spent Dollars 11m
(Pounds 6m) last year on rebates for Medicaid, the federally-funded
healthcare programme. It warned that such rebates would increase
significantly in future years.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: 600 Group holds dividend as losses are
reduced to Pounds 534,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN 600 Group yesterday jumped 9p to 53p as the machine tool and
mechanical handling company proposed holding its dividend and said it was
broadly optimistic about the outlook.
The company reported an 18 per cent reduction in pre-tax losses, from Pounds
650,000 to Pounds 534,000, in the year to end-March.
Mr Colin Gaskell, group managing director, said margins were maintained and
costs cut during the period. 'We expect to achieve an improved outcome even
at current depressed levels of trading,' he said.
But he warned that business conditions remained difficult to predict and
were likely to stay depressed for 'six to nine months'.
Turnover fell 30 per cent from Pounds 140.8m to Pounds 98.5m. The company
said UK orders for machine tools were 50 per cent below normal levels, and
export markets were also difficult.
The fall in orders led to an operating loss of Pounds 1.74m (profit Pounds
4.1m). Interest costs improved to Pounds 2.1m (Pounds 3.3m) reflecting
falling interest rates and cost cutting.
The company was helped by exceptional profits of Pounds 3.3m, against costs
last time of Pounds 1.5m. This represented the balance between exceptional
surpluses of Pounds 9.4m from property sales and reorganisation costs of
Pounds 6.05m stemming from combining two lathe companies to one site.
Losses per share were 3.2p (3.3p). A proposed final dividend of 1.5p (1p)
makes an unchanged total of 2.5p. Transfers from reserves totalled Pounds
3.08m (Pounds 4.58m).
Cost savings of Pounds 13m were made during the year, compared to a
predicted saving of Pounds 6m. Stocks fell by Pounds 6m while debtors fell
in line with sales, the company said. This, combined with proceeds from
property disposals, helped bring gearing down from 36 per cent to 12 per
cent at the year end.
The full year figures also suggested a slight improvement from the interim
stage, when the company suffered a loss before tax of Pounds 2.32m on sales
of Pounds 50.6m, compared to profits of Pounds 1.66m on turnover of Pounds
72m.

FT  05 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Failure of Topic hits market commissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROLONGED failure in the London Stock Exchange Topic news and information
service caused a substantial loss of commission business for market firms
yesterday. Many institutional investors ceased to deal because of the
absence of reliable share price information.
The Topic system was unable to transmit for most of the session, due to a
software problem. The Stock Exchange Automated Quotations network (Seaq)
operated normally, but share price quotations were 'indicative' and not
binding on market makers.
The FT-SE 100 Index was partly indicative, and the FT-SE Eurotrack indices
was wholly indicative at the close.
The problems fell mostly on investment clients, including unit trusts,
merchant banks, and pension funds. In the absence of screen quotations, fund
managers had to choose between dealing 'blind' at the share prices quoted by
marketmakers over the telephone, or to withdraw temporarily from the market.
'For them, it was rather like stepping up to the crease at baseball with a
sack over your head and trying to hit the ball,' commented Mr Nigel Little
of Panmure Gordon, the UK brokerage house. Most managers soon decided to
quit the field.
Most of the large securities firms, including the market makers, were able
to take market information on digital feeds from the Stock Exchange which
were unaffected. This information is then fed into the firms' own in-house
computer networks, giving traders access to most of the normal market
information and data.
The loss in client business will not be known until this morning.
Yesterday's Seaq volume total of 505.9m shares compared fairly well with
Wednesday's 473.6m. But the Seaq total takes in trade from both clients and
market makers. Market maker business was high yesterday as the London-based
houses arbitraged between stock index futures and the underlying stocks.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Standard Chartered accepts Dollars 62m MiniScribe payment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD CHARTERED Bank yesterday agreed to a Dollars 62m (Pounds 34.4m)
out-of-court payment in the US from Coopers &amp; Lybrand, the accountancy firm,
and other defendants following the collapse of MiniScribe, a computer
disk-drive manufacturer.
Total settlements arising out of MiniScribe are now believed to be the
largest ever against an auditor after Coopers last month made a separate
out-of-court payment. This class action suit, brought by bondholders in
MiniScribe in Texas, initially resulted in punitive damages of Dollars 550m,
including more than Dollars 200m against Coopers. However, that decision was
overturned by the judge, but Coopers is believed to have paid between
Dollars 40m and Dollars 50m in an out-of-court agreement.
Standard Chartered lent Dollars 120m to MiniScribe in 1988. The company
later filed for bankruptcy protection, and the bank alleged fraud and
negligence on the part of the defendants since 1986.
The bank, which brought legal actions in Colorado, said yesterday it would
recover its initial loan as a result of the settlement and realisations of
assets made from MiniScribe.
Undisclosed portions of the settlement will come from Hambrecht &amp; Quist,
investment bankers, Mr QT Wiles, chairman of MiniScribe, and Ellco, a
leasing company.
Mr Martin Hayman, head of legal services at Standard Chartered, said: 'The
result was the right result. We are not happy but are satisfied it is the
best for our shareholders.'
Coopers will be expected to provide payment from its US partnership. If
funds are insufficient, its partners are personally liable for the
difference.
Mr Harris Amhowitz, deputy chairman and general counsel for Coopers &amp;
Lybrand in New York, denied any culpability in the firm's audit of
MiniScribe.
'Nevertheless, the firm agreed to settle to avoid the uncertainties of
successive jury trials.'
The Dollars 62m settlement is subject to US court approval, but Standard
Chartered said it expected that to be a formality.
A Dollars 338m settlement for Standard Chartered against Price Waterhouse
was awarded by an Arizona jury last month, relating to the bank's purchase
of United Bank of Arizona in 1987 for Dollars 334m. Price Waterhouse is
still considering its response.

FT  05 JUN 92 / O&amp;Y reveals list of leading creditors
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation, which is bidding to take over
Midland Bank, was revealed yesterday as Olympia &amp; York's biggest creditor,
with a total exposure of at least USDollars 780m (Pounds 433m) and
collateral worth far less than the principal amount.
A bulky document filed by the debt-ridden Canadian property developer with
the Ontario Court of Justice also identifies several Japanese banks among
O&amp;Y's most generous lenders. Six Japanese institutions are the biggest
participants in a USDollars 500m term loan led by Citibank of the US and
secured by O&amp;Y's shareholding in Carena Properties, a property holding
company which itself is in financial trouble.
The document details all borrowings by Olympia &amp; York Developments (the main
holding company of the owners, the Reichmann family) and the 28 Canadian
subsidiaries which sought court protection on May 14.
The debt of these companies totals about two thirds of O&amp;Y's total debt of
CDollars 13.5bn (Pounds 6.2bn) but does not include direct loans to Canary
Wharf in London's Docklands or to the company's 20 or so buildings in the
US. Two British banks, Barclays and Lloyds, have a substantial direct
exposure to Canary Wharf.
O&amp;Y's biggest lender was previously assumed to be Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, which last week disclosed an exposure of CDollars 860m. HSBC
provided USDollars 750m (CDollars 903m) of a Dollars 2.5bn loan negotiated
in 1989. In addition, Hongkong Bank of Canada, a wholly-owned subsidiary,
advanced CDollars 32m in demand loans.
The security for the jumbo loan consists of O&amp;Y's stakes in Abitibi-Price
and Gulf Canada Resources. Mr Alain Tuchmaier of McLean McCarthy in Toronto
calculates the current market value of the shares pledged to HSBC at only
CDollars 588m.
The most heavily exposed Japanese banks are Tokai and Dai-Ichi Kangyo. Tokai
provided half of the Citibank-led Dollars 500m term facility. Dai-Ichi
Kangyo put Dollars 180m towards the jumbo loan.
According to Mr Tuchmaier, the security provided for the Citibank loan is
now worth CDollars 173m, less than a third of the principal amount. Japanese
institutions are also known to have lent heavily to several O&amp;Y properties
in New York.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Wellcome unveils outline of share sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTORS bidding for shares in Wellcome, the drug company, in the Pounds
4bn global share sale set for next month, will receive more favourable
treatment if they put their bids in early and do not indulge in 'market
activity' which might depress the share price, Robert Fleming, the UK
merchant bank co-ordinating the sale, said yesterday.
The outline of the tender offer, under which the Wellcome Trust, the medical
charity, will reduce its stake in the group by between 202m and 417m shares,
was announced yesterday. Wellcome shares slipped 5p to 958p.
The filing of the 'pink herring' prospectus, so-called because it omits more
of the final details of the sale than is usual, allows the group to begin
the process of familiarising international investors with the group's
business.
Wellcome, which went public in 1986, is not well known internationally as a
company, although its drugs are famous, notably Retrovir, its controversial
Aids treatment.
As the trust still owns 73.6 per cent of the equity, the shares have been
difficult to deal in. Only 2 per cent of the shares are held in the US, the
company's most important market.
Mr Lawrence Banks, head of corporate finance at Fleming, said the structure
of the sale was designed to maximise the proceeds to the trust and to
produce an orderly after-market for the shares. The final size and price of
the offer will be determined by bids made by investors to the issue's
managers in eight regional syndicates.
The offer follows the US style of a book building sale, which is expected to
give the trust a higher price for its shares than a UK type of offering
would. The issue will not be underwritten, meaning that fees will be higher
than a UK issue but the discount to the market price should be significantly
lower.
The marketing campaign will begin on June 25 with an offering circular,
which will give the provisional size of the sale.
The tender period starts on July 6, but bids will only become firm at the
closing date two or three weeks later. Pricing is expected to take place
overnight or over a weekend so that investors do not carry any significant
market risk. All the shares will be sold at the same price.

FT  05 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Anglian Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by yesterday's 10.3 per cent dividend increase, Anglian Water has
grown tired of its reputation for caution. The payout raises the question of
what water companies should do with unforeseen profits. Anglian's dividend
reflects inflation and a real increase agreed with the regulator at the time
of privatisation. In addition, it contains an unexpected element of reward
to shareholders for efficiency gains, the remaining benefits of which will
be passed on to customers as a voluntary 0.5 per cent reduction in Anglian's
permitted price increases.
Admittedly, customers probably get a greater share of the spoils, and
Anglian has been refreshingly open as to how it did its sums. The problem is
that other water companies might dispute its reasoning, not least the use of
a rather high 4.7 per cent average annual inflation rate, against the more
widely used 4 per cent inflation figure for March. Adjust for that, and
shareholders have done rather better than it appears. In marking its shares
to a new high, the market was not slow to appreciate Anglian's generosity.
More generally, it is perhaps worth asking why water companies should do
anything at all to boost dividends at a time when they are already able to
pay real increases far ahead of the market average. Arguably, it would be
better to reinvest extra cash in the hope that it will be earning a
distributable return when conditions are rather less favourable. Water is,
after all, a long-term business.

FT  05 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Boots
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's 5 per cent drop in the Boots share price in response to a 9 per
cent rise in full year earnings seems a little perverse. Gruesome though it
is to see the non-chemist retail business lose Pounds 5m on Pounds 625m of
turnover, it is scarcely unexpected. It may also be disconcerting to hear
that spending on the heart drug Manoplax - Mananaplax as market wags call it
 -will rise this year from Pounds 18m to nearer Pounds 50m. But such
expenditure was always inevitable as the drug neared approval.
Granted, the figures recall a fundamental question: what on earth a hugely
successful chemist and druggist is doing losing money in DIY, toys and car
maintenance. The basic premise - that Boots' traditional retailing skills
could be applied outside its traditional markets - is plainly open to
question. The losses at Halfords, for instance, are due not only to the
recession but to basic flaws belatedly addressed. But if the non-chemist
retail brands prove intractable, they could doubtless be sold off when
retail spending eventually revives. In the meantime, it plainly helps that
they generated net cash last year despite their losses.
More generally, it is perhaps time to let the Ward White acquisition slip
into history. In the three years since the bid was launched, Boots' shares
have outperformed the market by 50 per cent and the stores sector by a
third. That same performance may make it hard to see the shares as cheap.
But plainly, the company has proved robust enough to survive its mistakes.

FT  05 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something slightly odd about the timing of Midland's announcement
of the sale of Thomas Cook. The deal improves the value of the bank to a
bidder, especially since Pounds 200m represents a full price for the
business. That being so, one might have expected Midland to reveal the sale
before HSBC made its final offer this week. But then, the Hongkong Bank
directors on Midland's board presumably knew the terms of the deal in
advance. The disclosure will give HSBC further grounds for justifying its
increased bid to its own shareholders at their forthcoming extraordinary
meeting. Whether it will make Midland investors keener on HSBC is another
matter.
Maybe the timing is pure coincidence. Thomas Cook is not a core Midland
business. It might have been sold earlier but for the Gulf war. Now that its
profits are recovering, Midland has received an offer it cannot refuse.
But the sale is a reminder that Midland does retain the option of
independence. It adds Pounds 128m to distributable reserves, making
affordable an increase in the dividend to its pre-recession level of 18p.
That adds powerfully to the argument for investors sitting tight until the
competition authorities have ruled on the Lloyds proposal. If yesterday's 2
per cent rise in Midland shares really was in anticipation of a higher
indicated price from Lloyds today, the market must either believe that it
will be allowed to bid or that Hongkong Bank will then come back with an
even better offer.

FT  05 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Blue Circle gets lucky
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Blue Circle Industries' Pounds 240m rights issue yesterday underlines
London's appetite for paper if the story is right. The company, after all,
long ago showed its ambition to buy into home products in continental
Europe. It has now clinched a deal which will improve its earnings for at
least the next 12 to 18 months. And though the begging bowl is out for
Pounds 36m more than its immediate needs, the extra money has been carefully
marked down for further expansion.
This said, it was charitable of the market to mark BCI's shares up 3p at
247p. For one thing, investors cannot be absolutely sure that the Celsius
acquisition is all it is cracked up to be. An historic exit multiple of 12
seems attractive, to be sure, but there is room for caution about the
consistency of profitability of the French boiler and radiators business in
earlier years. More pertinently, perhaps, BCI has to prove that it can make
a decent return from the Pounds 700m of shareholders' money which has now
been invested in home products. Recent margin improvements suggest that
Potterton and Myson are starting to perform. But Blue Circle's record in
this area is littered with goodwill write-offs and reorganisation costs,
which is largely why net assets per share have slipped 18 per cent over the
last six years.
On more optimistic forecasts for next year the forward multiple of around 14
may not seem demanding. A 6 per cent yield also provides useful support. On
the other hand, while doubts remain about the quality of some of Blue
Circle's assets - and management's ability to generate satisfactory returns
 -it is not quite clear that the shares deserve their current rating.

extending the London Underground to crisis-hit Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It is time to blow the whistle on London Underground's Jubilee Line. Plans
to extend it to Docklands at a cost of Pounds 1.7bn have been rendered
redundant by the financial collapse of Canary Wharf. To proceed with the
project now could be the railway equivalent of building Concorde.
This is not an assertion that many outside the Treasury will wish to hear,
but the facts argue in its favour. To set them in context, it is worth
dwelling for a moment on the project's history.
Extending the Underground to Docklands and the rest of London's eastern
hinterland is not a new idea. The Jubilee Line had two previous incarnations
in the 1970s: first, as the Fleet Line, running from the West End to the
City before turning southwards through Wapping to Lewisham; and second, as
the River Line, following the same course to the City but then serving the
Isle of Dogs and Thamesmead.
The financial case for these projects, however, never stacked up, and after
the oil price crises of the 1970s, the then Labour government was in no mood
for extravagance. So while a vestige of those earlier plans survives in the
form of a pair of empty tunnels running forlornly under the streets of
London eastwards as far as Aldwych, the passenger-carrying part of the
re-named Jubilee Line never stretched beyond its present terminus at Charing
Cross.
When, in 1981, the Conservative government set up the London Docklands
Development Corporation to oversee the regeneration of docklands, it had to
look again at east London's transport needs. But an Underground line from
the West End costing more than Pounds 1bn still looked an absurdly expensive
proposition in the context of the modest regeneration then envisaged.
Instead, the government opted for the construction of the Docklands Light
Railway on a shoestring budget of just Pounds 77m.
That might have been the end of the story had it not been for the Reichmann
brothers. But when they and their private property company, Olympia &amp; York,
arrived in 1987 with their grandiose scheme to turn the the Isle of Dogs
into a business centre rivalling the West End and the City, the transport
plans were thrown into chaos.
Contrary to popular myth, the government was not tardy in its response.
Rather, it reacted with astonishing speed and generosity. Within months, it
was carrying out detailed work on the options for improving Docklands'
transport infrastructure. The East London Rail Study was published in
January 1989, and in November that same year a Bill to authorise
construction of the Jubilee Line extension went before parliament. Some
Pounds 3.5bn was committed to roads, the Underground line and the upgrading
of the Docklands Light Railway.
Meanwhile, central London, crippled during the boom years of the late 1980s
by appalling congestion and decaying infrastructure, was left to rot.
The biggest single factor underlying this investment in Docklands
infrastructure was the prediction that the Canary Wharf development would
boost the number of jobs in Docklands to 150,000 by the year 2005. (Canary
Wharf alone, which today houses fewer than 4,000 people, was predicted to
provide jobs for up to 55,000 on completion.)
But Canary Wharf's financial collapse and the death of the commercial
property market have pushed those forecasts into the realms of fantasy. If
they are ever achieved, it will not be until at least a decade later than
expected.
It is too late, however, to delay much of the transport infrastructure. By
this time next year, the bulk of the Pounds 1.65bn Docklands roadbuilding
programme - the biggest road programme in Britain - will be complete,
leaving the area with excellent access for buses, coaches, taxis and cars.
Unlike the City or the West End, Docklands will also benefit from cheap and
almost unlimited parking.
The Docklands Light Railway, meanwhile, will have been transformed from its
present toy-town railway status to an urban mass transit system. Some Pounds
800m has been spent on extending the line to Bank in the City and Beckton in
the east, and by next year the line's capacity will have risen from its 1987
level of 15,000 passengers a day to 15,000 passengers an hour.
Few transport planners would dispute that, with this infrastructure in
place, the combined capacity of all transport modes to Docklands will be
adequate well beyond the Jubilee Line's planned opening date of 1996. So
does it not make sense to shelve the Jubilee Line extension until it is
needed, and get on with more pressing projects?
The Jubilee Line extension's advocates answer that to do so would seal
Docklands' doom. With the Jubilee Line in place, Canary Wharf could still
fulfil its creators' dream of becoming a third London business centre.
Without it, the development can never hope to be regarded as anything other
than a second-rate out-of-town location for clerical and back-office
functions.
The difficulty with this argument is that it contains an element of wishful
thinking. There is little likelihood that that Canary Wharf would fulfill
its creators' dream in the foreseeable future even if the Jubilee Line were
in place, and the Treasury will rightly question whether such a large
expenditure of taxpayers' money should be gambled on such an uncertain
out-come.
Meanwhile there are many other transport projects in London to which
investment could be usefully diverted - and which, in pure transport terms,
deliver greater benefits per pound than the Jubilee Line. London Transport,
though extremely reluctant to abandon the Jubilee Line after investing so
much time and money in it, has started to draw up an emergency list of
projects it could bring forward in its place.
The long-overdue upgrading of the existing Underground system, the stepping
up of the station modernisation programme, an acceleration of the planned
Northern Line upgrade and the possibility of bringing forward the Pounds
1.7bn Paddington-Liverpool Street CrossRail project by a year are among the
benefits that would accrue to Londoners in the next five years if only the
Jubilee Line extension were postponed.
Even that would only soak up Pounds 600m to Pounds 700m. With the change
from Pounds 1.7bn, the government would have enough to console everyone
working at Canary Wharf with a free Rolls Royce, and still save the taxpayer
money.

Richard Reisz, executive producer of the series, wrote to your

company prior to filming to guard against any possible misunderstanding. The
letter was clear and unequivocal and included the sentence: 'I should like
to confirm that the point of this series is for Sir John Harvey-Jones to

What does John Butterfill, who has just missed becoming chairman of the Tory

minister Anthony Nelson and Jonathan Aitken, now a junior minister at
defence?
It seems the 51-year-old Butterfill, too, was a protege of erstwhile tycoon
Jim Slater, whose Slater Walker empire collapsed in the 1970s. A chartered
surveyor, Butterfill used to be managing director of St Paul's Securities,
one of Slater Walker's many property vehicles.
Although former Welsh secretary Peter Walker and Sir Peter Morrison, Mrs
Thatcher's parliamentary private secretary, are no longer MPs, 63-year-old
Slater still must have more old pals in Parliament than many businessmen of
his generation. A bottle of malt for the most comprehensive list of MPs who
got their business training in the Slater Walker empire.

The Silent Service found its tongue with a vengeance yesterday, waxing

fog-shrouded collision with a Panamanian-flagged merchant vessel.
Opportune did nothing inopportune, the Royal Navy roared. She was barely
moving when struck by the merchantman Radnes, whose captain and crew are
being questioned by a department of transport inspector.
According to the RN, the submarine was sailing cautiously on the surface
when its radar showed the other ship approaching through the fog at about 15
knots. Opportune took evasive action and was virtually stationary with
engines full astern at the moment of collision.
'An exchange of views took place by radio,' a spokesman added.

The selectively press-shy Maurice Saatchi restricted himself to a brief 'no

FT  05 JUN 92 / Observer: What makes a governor
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Where will the British government's new policy of open-ness end? To judge by
the spate of advertisements for such politically sensitive posts as chairman
of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission and Director of Public
Prosecutions, Prime Minister Major's team seems determined to give everyone
a shot at the top jobs.
Or is it?
Even Observer has to admit that the line between cosy appointments and open
competition has to be drawn somewhere. Advertising in the press for a new
boss of MI5 or MI6 might attract the wrong sort of candidate. But surely a
case could be made for advertising senior posts in the civil service or the
governorship of the Bank of England?
Given that Robin Leigh-Pemberton will step down as Governor next year and
should collect the traditional peerage, there should be lots of interest in
his job. However, the authorities seem shy, to say the least, about whether
they intend to advertise for his successor in the press.
Part of the problem is that any job-description for the governorship would
almost certainly infringe either the Trade Descriptions or the Sex
Discrimination Act, if not both, and could hardly fail to upset the Equal
Opportunities Commission.
For a start, the candidate would have to be good at nods and winks and be
generously endowed with that mysterious City quality, 'bottom'. An ability
to be either totally subservient to the Treasury or completely independent,
on demand, would be useful.
A further must could well be demonstrable ability to terrify financial
markets with the spectre of another Labour government.

Sir, Like most of the public services dear to our hearts, the BBC is

the standard the BBC maintains on our behalf for such a meagre annual
contribution. What are the government's intentions in constantly undermining
the BBC's capacity to produce? I doubt if they reflect the views of the

progressive threat. It should be left alone. Double the licence fee and it
would still be good value.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I observed with interest both the run-up to the Danish referendum and
the reaction to the result, with the final vote being 50.7 per cent against
ratification of Maastricht.
Notwithstanding the exit polls, which indicated a last-minute swing to a yes
vote, the result did not come as a major surprise to me, as during the short
period before the referendum the reaction to the Vote Yes campaign was
either indifference at best and in some cases open hostility.
Scaremongering was used by both camps, with forecasts of large job losses
predicted by Uffe Ellemann-Jansen, the foreign minister, if the vote was no,
and an invasion of Danish summer houses by other nationals (in particular
Germans) if the vote was yes. The details of Maastricht were on the whole
left out of the arguments, and in the end the vote appears to have been made
on the basis of gut reaction by the Danish people.
Last weekend at my local cinema, the advertisement for the yes vote was
greeted with loud derision. It showed a young couple holding hands, the boy
having the Union Jack on his backpack and the girl with the Danish flag. It
may come as no surprise that the film was 'Basic Instinct'.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Letter: Equity share a pragmatic solution for borrowers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From SIMON RANDALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your leader, 'The next step in housing' (June 2), implies that the
improvement in repossession trends in the first few months of the year owes
much to the direct payments of mortgage interest for income recipients and
the counselling and renegotiation for borrowers in arrears.
While one cannot under-estimate the importance of financial advice to home
owners experiencing mortgage difficulties, in real terms the option of
renegotiating a mortgage in such a way that it would have a discernible
effect on reducing monthly payments is limited.
Any notion that borrowers are 'reluctant to rejoin the tenantry' is
completely unfounded. An increasingly significant number of borrowers in
arrears see equity-share as the only pragmatic solution which allows them to
retain their home without undue financial hardship.
Quite apart from this, lending institutions would be short-sighted to
dismiss equity share as economically unfavourable for they are well aware
that a glut of devalued properties does little to inspire confidence in an
already unstable house market.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Leading Article: How not to cut public spending
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRIME Minister has warned his cabinet that this year's public spending
round will be especially tight. At the Treasury, the Chief Secretary, Mr
Michael Portillo, flag-bearer of the Thatcherite tendency, should be true to
the prime minister's word. He needs to be. But he should also eschew the
standard Treasury approach, which ensures that the government does too much,
all of it equally badly. What is needed is a more radical rethinking of
public spending.
So naturally unradical a prime minister will find this uncomfortable. But
powerful forces will drive Mr Major in that direction: foremost among them
the state of the public finances. The chancellor of the exchequer insists he
is sticking to his forecast of a Pounds 28bn public sector borrowing
requirement this year. If so, that would be the only forecast he will be
able to stick to. Growth will probably be lower than the 1 per cent forecast
in the budget. Unemployment is also bound to be higher than the forecast of
2.4m, on which the spending estimates were based.
Nor are slow growth and high unemployment the sole reason for the fiscal
deterioration. Over the past year, discretionary increases have done almost
as much as recession to boost public spending, now some 43 per cent of gross
domestic product.
Economic growth cannot be relied upon to come to the rescue. The Treasury
has consistently hoped that the economy would start to grow strongly in the
not too distant future. It has proved consistently wrong. Since the public
sector deficit is highly sensitive to the rate of economic growth, slow
growth, never mind continued recession, would play havoc with Mr Portillo's
sums.
The prime minister has also chosen two rods for his back. First, his
citizen's charters impose standards on the public sector that people will
expect to be met. Second, he has committed the country to the Maastricht
convergence criteria, prominent among which is a target of 3 per cent for
the ratio of the general government deficit to GDP, this being well below
current magnitudes.
The standard Treasury response is penny pinching. The heaviest cuts will
fall on the least well defended programmes, with investment cut most savage
of all.
There is another way, one that only a government at the beginning of its
term could attempt. The watchword should be the chief secretary's words:
'unlike the Labour party,' he has said, 'we do not believe in the inexorable
growth of the reach and size of the state. Nor do we believe that the state
can and should try to solve all our problems.'
How might these words be put into practice? First, valuable investment
should be defended from the squeeze on spending. More fundamentally, the
government should ask of every area of activity whether the public sector
need to do this at all and, if it does, whether users should make a
financial contribution.
Mr Major will shy away from such questions. But he must accept the
implications of failure to do so: either the government will be driven
towards higher taxation or it will fail to deliver the high-quality services
it has promised. Government need not be a penny-pinched nanny. Mr Major
should ensure it is not.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Bets are off in a three-horse race: Ross Perot's rise in the
US presidential contest marks a breakdown in traditional party politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The United States is now sailing in waters politically uncharted in 80
years. Three candidates, not the usual two plus or minus a distant third,
want to be president and any one of them could make it. All the standard
electoral calculations are rendered for the moment suspect. Proving the
point, California, the biggest state and supposedly its trendsetter, held a
primary on Tuesday - and hardly anyone noticed or cared.
Serious three-horse races in the US are rare, as in Britain. The last
approximation to what could happen here was in 1912 when former president
Teddy Roosevelt, running on the ticket of the independent Bull Moose party,
won nearly 30 per cent of the vote. No other independent has since hit
double digits except George Wallace from Alabama in 1968, and he was, in the
end, strictly a regional candidate, albeit one who helped put Richard Nixon
in the White House.
But Ross Perot is a completely different sort of independent candidate. All
the others of note this century had party roots - Teddy Roosevelt, Robert
LaFollette, Henry Wallace, Strom Thurmond, George Wallace, John Anderson. Mr
Perot not only springs from no party, he is above, beyond and without party.
He conforms to tradition only in that he is a populist, a long line, to be
sure, but one normally confined to state boundaries, like the Kingfish, Huey
Long of Louisiana.
Mr Perot, it must be said from the outset, could also prove to be one of the
greatest ephemeral and illusory candidates of all time. His current popular
standing, at least level with President Bush and usually ahead of Governor
Bill Clinton, is attested to only by exit and public opinion polls of
smallish samples and, more persuasively, by the insistent buzz on the
talkshow airwaves and the mini-rush to his cause by some political veterans,
like Ed Rollins and Hamilton Jordan. To know Ross Perot, as the country
still does not, may not be to love him.
Six short weeks ago, the most that sobersided political observers would
concede was that he might be a factor in some states, like California,
always freaky, and Texas, his home. The basic question then was whether he
would hurt Mr Bush or Mr Clinton more, on which opinions were divided.
That is no longer the case; the same sobersides may still not believe in
their experienced minds that he will win, but their noses and their ears are
picking up smells and sounds that he might. He may lack all the conventional
attributes of a successful campaign - organisation, policies, advice, core
constituencies, everything with the exception of money - but if the country
is as angry as it seems then conventional wisdom matters less.
Why is this so? It does stretch credulity that a funny looking tycoon with a
Texas twang, known to be intolerant of disagreement, inclined to cut corners
in the pursuit of his goals, notorious for a folksy wisdom stuffed with
inconsistencies, and almost wilfully ignorant of some of the great issues of
our time, should be even considered as the popular choice to run the most
pluralistic, complex and constitutionally enshrined democracy the modern
world has produced.
The answer lies in part in the previous sentence. Americans want solutions,
not explanations, and he promises action. They are desperately disappointed
with the two party system, which has been in decline for a generation. Mr
Perot has found a new way to manipulate the establishment media, principally
by ignoring it. He has money, his own, to burn, which means that at least
his own campaign is not being financed out of taxpayer pockets. He is not
now, nor has he ever been, a regular or intimate member of the
establishment, though he has supped with it.
But mostly his improbable rise is a reflection of the alternatives, George
Bush and Bill Clinton. For Mr Clinton, in particular, this must seem
profoundly unfair. Having proclaimed himself the candidate of 'change,' and
made a detailed case for what should be done, he finds Mr Perot stealing his
clothes without ever saying specifically what he would do instead. Having
tried to pull the Democratic Party towards the sort of centre considered
necessary to win elections, he is now possibly more dependent on the liberal
special interests which still constitute its core.
Admittedly Mr Clinton was never his party's first choice, only emerging
after the Democrat heavyweights last year declined to take on an
overwhelmingly popular president. But his sense of Mr Bush's vulnerability
was right. More than that, he had to fight through scurrilous coverage of
his private life - wounds still not healed in the public perception - and
yet managed to beat back Democratic challengers of left and right. But the
emergence of Perotism, plus the distraction of the Los Angeles riots, has
meant that the better he has done in the primaries the more he has been
ignored.
Mr Clinton is tough and smart and in this for the duration. What nobody can
figure out any longer is what President Bush is in it for, or indeed even
whether his heart is in it. This does not mean he is going to lose, but his
reelection, apparently so certain six short months ago, is no longer
assured.
It is hard to convey the magnitude of the indifference with which the
president is now regarded at home. In the end Richard Nixon was loathed
because he had deceived and Jimmy Carter was dismissed because he had
disappointed. It is much harder to point a specific finger against Mr Bush
simply because the target seems so insubstantial. But it is a fact that on
any given evening it is easy to hear a constant private litany of complaint
from staunch Republicans - not the far right now led by Pat Buchanan - that
there is a void in the White House.
This sounds extreme of a president who led his country and the world so well
through the Gulf War. But the growing impression is that the resolution
demonstrated in the Gulf was in fact an aberration; the norm is only one of
reaction and expediency, and the charge sheet covers the full gamut of
taxation, the budget deficit, the inner cities, civil rights, abortion, the
environment, Yugoslavia, and now even poor Haiti.
Not even a recovering economy is yet working to his advantage, in spite of
all the statistics that say it always does. This is partly because of the
discrepancy between improving national figures and substantial local lags,
especially in the west. It is partly a testament to the fact that this
recession really did hurt and that recovery is still weak. Also, a three way
race makes it harder for Mr Bush to pin all the blame on 'tax and spend'
Democrats, when he has Mr Perot as well as Mr Clinton round his neck
pointing out that the budget deficit under the Reagan and Bush
administrations increased eightfold.
The overall picture is of an unwillingness at present to give President Bush
credit for anything, beyond the Gulf war. Even the nation's chief
executives, three quarters of whom will vote for him, according to a Fortune
magazine survey this week, profess little enthusiasm, but more a fear of the
alternatives.
There has been a tendency of late to say that it is not the president's
fault and that he is getting bad political advice. This explains the
non-stop flurry of rumours - that James Baker will be brought back from the
State Department to run the White House or the campaign, that vice president
Dan Quayle will be dumped from the ticket in favour of General Colin Powell,
that Mr Quayle might swap jobs either with Mr Baker or with Dick Cheney at
the Pentagon. All are denied and none will probably happen, but their very
currency bespeaks the perception of an incumbent president in trouble.
Of the campaign itself, the standard criticism is that too much time was
devoted to squashing the gnat that was the Buchanan campaign and not enough
to anticipating the threat of Mr Perot or the staying power of Mr Clinton or
to divining the nation's mood of discontent.
Above all, the president himself seems unable these days to articulate
either vision or policy with any consistency. Releasing Mr Quayle to lay
into the 'liberal' values of the media makes perfect political sense - but
it requires the president to play a part too, preferably above the fray.
This Mr Bush has failed to do, and has appeared confused and unpresidential
in consequence. Where he does speak, 'Bushisms,' his now notorious mangling
of the language, simply do not reduce to soundbites, and they are often even
more incomprehensible in print.
So what happens next? Normally there is a lull between the end of the
primaries and the party conventions, the Democrats' in New York in mid-July,
the Republicans' in Houston a month later. This month will be consumed by
speculation about when Mr Perot formally declares, who he runs with, and
what is the meaning of whatever he says. There will be much delving into his
history and his ideas, which may or may not hurt him.
There remains the possibility, very slight, of a movement to stop Mr Clinton
getting the nomination. It might gain pace if he is seen to be slipping in
the polls into a poor third place. It is mathematically possible for the 722
superdelegates to the convention, party bosses mostly, to get together and
deny him a first ballot victory. But the stop Clinton forces have no leader
and no apparent cause and he could stop both in their tracks by a shrewd
choice of running mate (for which the popular choice remains Senator Bill
Bradley of New Jersey).
What Mr Bush does, frankly, is anybody's guess. The best recourse for an
incumbent is always to be seen to be presidential, but neither the Earth
Summit in Rio, which he is attending reluctantly, nor the economic summit in
Munich next month promise initiatives that will grab the public imagination.
There is little on the Congressional agenda for him to make a distinctive
mark beyond exercise of the veto and if the Supreme Court upholds
Pennsylvania's restrictive abortion laws then his own pro-life stance will
land him slap in the middle of a divisive debate with clear political risk
attached.
It is, therefore, perhaps appropriate that exactly 500 years ago Columbus
sailed into uncharted waters and discovered America. If he returned, he
might think not much has changed since - no Republicans, no Democrats and a
lot of restless natives.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Hard training
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
JOURNALISTS always think that leaked documents are the most exciting; in the
case of the tortuous debate about improving Britain's training system,
leaked documents also seem to be the clearest.
Recently there have been two: one from the business people who run the
fledgling training and enterprise councils and a second from Sir Geoffrey
Holland, permanent secretary at the Department of Employment.
The Tec leaders' note is of interest mainly because of the unrestrained
language in which it makes its case that 'the Tec movement is on a
knife-edge'. It argues that Tecs know their purpose and have the energy and
expertise to deliver, but they are being impeded by Whitehall inflexibility
and shortage of funds.
Sir Geoffrey's note has benefited from the thinking time allowed to civil
servants during a general election campaign. It is essentially a memo to the
new minister, taking stock and setting an agenda. As such, it is a good deal
sharper than any recollectable political speech on this subject.
Sir Geoffrey argues that Tecs are fragile ('dented but not irrecoverably')
and in danger of losing momentum. He explores three main remedies: the
adoption and vigorous pursuit of clear and publishable targets; a better
relationship between Tecs and their local education systems; and a more
effective national-level umbrella body.
The most striking thought which occurs in response to this list is the
extent to which it points a finger at the government itself. The
Thatcher/Major administrations have vacillated wildly about targets,
declined to require any formal link between Tecs and local education
authorities and resolutely defended the congeries of committees and cabals
which has connected the Tec network and central government.
This is then followed by a second thought. Local education authorities are
central to improved vocational education. But in pursuit of its education
reforms the government is drastically changing and perhaps destroying them,
without adequately considering how they are to be reshaped or replaced.
This is no way to treat the Tecs, charged as they are with such an important
aspect of Britain's competitiveness.
Targets, based upon the emerging system of national vocational
qualifications and the floundering Investors in People 'kitemark' for
training, are a prerequisite both for motivating Tecs and for judging their
performance, which ought in turn to be the eventual basis upon which they
are funded. Coupled with an appropriately flexible institutional structure,
based upon the now familiar purchaser-provider model, these changes would do
much to renew the momentum of Tecs.
And who knows, in the promised world of open government, perhaps those
involved could then also communicate in public.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Euro-deals
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN IS a Euro-merger not a Euro-merger? The question was central to the
recent argument over whether the rival bids for Midland Bank by Lloyds and
the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) should be examined by
competition authorities in Brussels or London. Now the issue has arisen
again over the vetting of the planned Dollars 2.5bn takeover by Nestle, the
Swiss food group, of Perrier, the French mineral water company.
In the Midland case, matters were resolved after EC merger authorities
decided to limit their scrutiny to the HSBC offer - which they swiftly
cleared - leaving the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission with sole
jurisdiction over the Lloyds bid, which is still being investigated. In the
event, that was a sensible compromise because an HSBC-Midland merger might
have had competition implications at the EC level, while Lloyds' offer bore
exclusively on the UK market.
The issues in the Nestle-Perrier case are different. The European Commission
has launched a full investigation into the deal on the grounds that it could
damage competition in just one national market, France, where Brussels
estimates the merged company would account for more than half all mineral
water sales. That approach is strongly contested by Nestle, which argues
that the relevant market against which the merger should be judged is the EC
as a whole.
As a general principle, it would be greatly preferable for the EC to leave
national authorities to examine large mergers which potentially affect
competition in only one country. However, the French government has chosen -
at least partly for domestic political reasons - not to refer the Perrier
deal to its national competition commission. As a result, Brussels is the
only authority available to handle a deal which clearly demands anti-trust
scrutiny. The case for an EC investigation is strengthened by the risk that
the merged company could use monopoly profits earned on the French market to
distort competition elsewhere in the Community.
However, while the particular circumstances of this case justify Brussels'
involvement, it is a second-best solution. Effective merger control requires
firm and consistent regulation by independent authorities at both the EC and
the national level, with clearly defined jurisdictions and common criteria
for judging deals. Trying to muddle through with a patchwork system which
avoids jurisdictional conflict only by accident will simply create
increasing legal anomalies, political friction and business uncertainty.

<TEXT>
Europe may test Mr John Major as it did Mrs Margaret Thatcher before him. It
tested her to destruction. He has so far demonstrated that he is made of
more supple material. Now, suddenly, he is seen to be potentially
vulnerable, the leader of a divided party, a prime minister whose authority
rests on a slender parliamentary majority, a head of government who is
waiting for events to come to his rescue.
The awkward moment may pass. Mr Major's European fellow-politicians are
doing their best to arrange a neat fix to circumvent Wednesday's negative
vote by the obstinate Danes. They made a start in Oslo yesterday, when the
assembled EC foreign ministers started to talk about an arrangement whereby
the other 11 members go ahead on their own, in the hope that the Danish
electorate will eventually reverse its vote. 'Europe has always proceeded by
a series of hiccups and this is one of them,' said the UK foreign secretary,
Mr Douglas Hurd. His would have been the voice of the soothing optimist
during the Great Plague.
The prime minister could find himself choking on this particular hiccup. Any
fix, however neat, is likely to involve some juridical sleight-of-hand, to
get around the unanimity provisions of the Treaty of Rome. The result would
rightly be regarded as a stitch-up, a dubious deal. That would further
trouble Conservative backbenchers. It would certainly confirm the popular
suspicion that EC matters are arranged in back rooms. Article A of the
Maastricht Treaty refers to decisions being taken 'as closely as possible to
the citizen'. This would be exposed as a sham.
There is only one honest way forward. Maastricht must be reviewed, in spite
of the Danish government's abandonment of its request for a renegotiation.
The revised treaty's terms should be put to a popular vote. This would be
tricky. A new inter-governmental conference would be unpredictable. There
would be strong pressure to increase the powers of the European Commission,
at the expense of the Europe des patries structure so skilfully bargained
for by Mr Major. That would blow the Tory party wide open.
Alternatively, the UK opposition parties could nearly unite it by assaulting
the prime minister's entire European strategy. All they have to do is demand
a referendum.
As it happens, the Labour party is ill-placed to do this. Mr Neil Kinnock is
a lame-duck leader who has rejected a referendum. On July 18 he will be
replaced by Mr John Smith, a dedicated pro-European and a man not easily
persuaded to make grandstand plays. Yet the case in favour of a British
consultation is stronger than it was before the Danish voters indicated by a
slender majority that their opinion is different from the one urged upon
them by their politicians and their media. In April it did not seem to
matter that there was no popular debate about the Maastricht treaty during
the British election campaign, since all parties supported it. Now there is
to be a referendum in France. The Irish are going ahead with their ballot.
Such pan-European polling evidence as exists shows no widespread popular
enthusiasm for the treaty.
We who have argued that Maastricht represents a defeat for the proponents of
a centralised government of a United States of Europe are mere politicians
and commentators. Wider electorates, as the Danes have shown, may see
matters differently. The treaty itself repeatedly refers to this or that new
or extended power of the appointed commission; the weasel words which,
largely at Britain's insistence, trim these back have to be sought for in
the small print. A referendum would oblige the government to produce a clear
exposition of what the various clauses mean, something not yet vouchsafed to
MPs, let alone the country.
Those who dream of a single Europe, placed in counterpoise to the United
States, fear a referendum. This is not democratic thinking, nor would an
imposed solution constitute a sound foundation for a step towards a
superstate. You can never be sure, but the chances are that the Irish and
the French will vote yes, and that the British, given the chance, would
follow suit. That would legitimise the European union in a way that can
never be achieved by meetings of heads of government, however democratically
elected they may be.
All this could come to dominate the second half of 1992, when Britain has
the EC presidency. Mr Major has only had a couple of days in which to
reflect upon this. So far he has stonewalled, with some success. His present
strategy is to carry on with talks about enlargement of the EC, completion
of the single market, bargaining over the Community budget and all the rest
of it, in the hope that time will untie the Danish knot. Perhaps it will.
But the prime minister knows that he cannot bank on it.

Anyone over 45 will have a sense of deja vu on hearing about Channel 4's new
series A Stab In The Dark (11.10): live, late night, topical, anarchic,
taking a stab at the powerful, the privileged and the pompous, re-examining
the week's events before a studio audience. No one is actually offering a
hostage to fortune and saying 'TW3', but who needs to?
For television drama involving steam trains, enamel advertisements and Fair
Isle pullovers look to the British. But for travel through time and space
with an eerie sense of the supernatural, the Americans have always been
streets ahead: those series from the late 1950s and early 60s, 'The Outer
Limits' and The Twilight Zone were pretty consistently impressive. Today's
TZ episode, 'King Nine Will Not Return' (1.05 in the morning, C4) opened the
second season of the series in September 1960.
The pilot of a B-25 bomber comes round after a crash during WorldWar 2 to
find the grave of one of his crew, and jet aircraft flying overhead.
Bob Cummings delivers the lines of the pilot as interior monologues in
voice-over: classic, gripping, American television drama.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Arts: Songmakers' Almanac - Concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The timing of this programme on Wednesday by the Songmakers' Almanac was
delightful. Under the title 'Community Singing' it set out to hymn European
unity on the very day that newspaper headlines were proclaiming the dream of
unity gone for good and the Community locked in discord - a different song
altogether.
As the programme reminded us, however, the issue of Europe as a single
nation has been in the minds of men for a century and more. This recital was
in the British Library's Stefan Zweig series and it was the words of the
Austrian writer that provided the running theme of the evening. On the day
that Bleriot crossed the Channel, Zweig apparently declared that there was
no longer any point in 'guards, customs controls and border duties', which
sounded like heresy being recited here at St John's, Smith Square, so close
to the Palace of Westminster.
In words or music Graham Johnson had sought to find connections among the 12
EC countries. The programme was effectively an intricate study of the
cross-fertilisation that has taken place between the various cultures and it
was a shame that its balance was upset by the last-minute absence of the
soprano, Nancy Argenta. Her replacement, Richard Jackson, found himself
awkwardly asked to deputise as a baritone Ellen in one of Schubert's Sir
Walter Scott settings.
That was one of many songs in which the composer chose poetry in a language
other than his own. Sarah Walker, for example, gave us Poulenc setting
Shakespeare and Haydn's solo Italian cantata Arianna a Naxos. Almost every
British mezzo must be tired of being compared to Janet Baker by now, but for
scalding Italian passion there really has been nothing to compare with Baker
in this particular piece, even if she did not have Walker's rasping chest
tones.
Of the three singers, Martyn Hill was in the most consistently good voice.
He offered Roussel tackling James Joyce and Gounod's seductive 'Maid of
Athens' to words by Lord Byron, a gift of a song that Johnson at the piano
milked for all its worth. Then, to finish, a sensitively shaped performance
of Britten's Six Holderlin Fragments, a short cycle which finds English
composer and German poet uniting in search of the Greek ideal.
All told, there was music or poetry from most of the EC countries - but not
Denmark. Perhaps the Songmakers' acute ear had caught a pre-echo of the
events to come.

<TEXT>
Perhaps no account of the fate of the Amerindians since Columbus could be
dispassionate. Home of the Brave, its title ironically provided by The Star
Spangled Banner, takes a highly charged subject and does all it can to
elicit an emotional and political response from its audience as it is
propelled from 15th century Castile to the White House. In more ways than
one, this 'amazing new museum experience' is a provocative as well as
spectacular European contribution to the Columbus quincentennial.
It is indeed an experience, a touring, Pounds 2m, multi-media tour-de-force
organised by Glasgow Museums and the Fondation Mecenat Science et Art of
Strasbourg. Visitors make their way through a sequence of dimly lit
stage-set galleries which chart the discoveries of the Americas and the
relentless quest for Eldorado. We travel with Columbus to the Bahamas and
the Caribbean islands, with Cortes to Mexico, Pizarro to Peru, and Jacques
Cartier to Canada. En route we encounter a recreated pueblo village and an
Iroquois longhouse.
As we progress, our cordless headsets pick up the music specially composed
by Phillipe Eidel, background sounds of dripping rain forest and crackling
fire, plus the narrative from the short films playing on the wide TV screens
clustered at seven different sites. There are things to touch: an Olmec
stone jaguar head from 1500BC Veracruz; a buckskin; a snowy feather
headdress and a recently carved 4m high totem. The borrowed tepee even
offers the lingering fragrance of the camp fire. Effects and videos are
exceptionally well done, and the headsets ensure peaceful viewing even if
surrounded by schoolchildren. The pitch is popular, but the quality of the
exhibits is sufficient to captivate the enthusiast for hours.
Glasgow has chosen to focus its show on peoples already familiar to its
audience, and British museum collections unsurprisingly boast rich holdings
of North American Indian artefacts. A far greater treat, however, is the
astounding and generous loans from Mexico. Here are dozens of sculptures,
bas reliefs, frescoes, ceramics and other ritual artefacts that have
survived from the pre-Columbian civilisations of South America. What is
maddening is that one wants to know more about the objects than the bald
captions supply, and the book - rather than catalogue - accompanying the
show does not oblige.
An elaborately carved chalk head from 500-700AD Chiapas, its intertwining
symbols forming a pictorial text, introduces us to a group of Mayan
rarities. A second gallery concentrates on the remarkable clay figurines and
vessels produced 1150-100BC, largely by the Olmecs or under their influence.
One naturalistically relaxed Guerrero figure from 1150-100BC is of a
well-coiffed woman sitting cross-legged in a fringed skirt, her left arm
supporting her weight. The garment draped across her shoulders might almost
be a cardigan. Zapotec funeral urns depicting various divinities are another
highlight.
No doubt much interest is generated by the basalt figure of one of the 400
Aztec gods of intoxication, and by the objects associated with the last
years of Aztec human sacrifice. Flint knives, some decorated with eyes and
teeth, were used to cut out human hearts which were then offered to the sun
to refresh the cosmic energy. Such rituals were to horrify the Spanish
Conquistadores, but was their own Auto da Fe any less morally reprehensible?
Inevitably, the exhibition book is able to explore more fully the
circumstances that compelled the confrontation of the Old and the New
Worlds, the subsequent devastation and, at times, the vital merging of the
two. (Americas Lost, edited by Daniel Levine, published by Bordas, Pounds
19.)
One of the strangest aspects of the chance discovery of the new continent is
how, again and again, the native Americans offered so little resistance to
relatively few Spanish troops and accepted their subjugation. Most of them,
it seems, anticipated the return of white and bearded divinities. That helps
us to understand why the Amerindians were literally demoralised when the
whites revealed themselves not as gods but as slaughterers and oppressors.
Their whole concept of the world was destroyed.
Certainly the record of the European presence in the Americas is shameful.
It is estimated that some 80 per cent of the native population disappeared
during and immediately following the Spanish Conquest. Smallpox and measles
brought death to thousands. The Old World gave its diseases, but took land,
slaves, and the plundered the continent's mineral resources. The great
monuments of the Aztec and Inca empires which had so amazed the
conquistadores were razed to the ground, and Catholic churches erected in
their place.
Unlike the Spanish, the British and French in the North showed little
inclination to intermarry and preferred to colonise Indian land. By the late
1770s, the colonial population outnumbered the Indians. By the end of the
19th century, the Indians had all but shared the fate of the buffalo. It is
with the history of the North American Indian that the exhibition, unlike
the book, loses its balance and objectivity.
We find a muslin tunic taken at the Battle of Wounded Knee in 1890 -
complete with bullet hole - among the pieces placed in old-fashioned museum
display cases. This presumably signifies the end of the living culture of
the Redskin and the beginning of the villainous White Man's ethnography. In
the same room, called 'The Old Museum', the TVs run the old cowboy and injun
movies that celebrate the pioneer's version of American history.
'Pacified America' offers an emotive climax. Its walls are lined with
colourful hand-blocked panoramic wallpaper first produced by Zuber in 1834,
and which hangs in the White House. Entitled 'Scenic America', its portrays
the North American Indian reduced to the indignity of curiosity as he dances
for the amusement of the white man. In the centre of the room, exhibited
behind a wire fence, are a dozen of the 40,000 sepia photographs taken by
Edward S. Curtis at the turn of the century to record the fading glory of
the redskin. They make a mockery of the words of the Star Spangled Banner
resounding in our ears.
In their simplistic portrayal of Indian life, the organisers of this
otherwise excellent exhibition are in danger of romanticising the North
American Indian and simply replacing the myth of the western with another of
late 20th century making, ecologically sound and politically correct.
The exhibition continues at the McLellan Galleries, Glasgow, until September
20, then on to Paris, Strasbourg, Munich, Lyon and Bordeaux

FT  05 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Insolvency statement is admissible
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REGINA v KANSAL
Court of Appeal (Criminal Division):
Lord Justice Russell, Mr Justice French and Mrs Justice Ebsworth:
May 12 1992
SELF-INCRIMINATING statements made by a bankrupt at his insolvency
examination can be used in evidence against him in any other proceedings,
including criminal proceedings for obtaining property by deception.
The Court of Appeal (Criminal Division) so held when dismissing an appeal by
Mr Yash Pal Kansal against convictions under the Theft Act 1968 and the
Insolvency Act 1986.
LORD JUSTICE RUSSELL said that in February 1992 Mr Kansal was convicted of
obtaining property by deception contrary to section 15(1) of the Theft Act
1968, in that he dishonestly obtained cheques of Pounds 150,000 and Pounds
116,250 from the Halifax Building Society by falsely representing that his
annual income was Pounds 90,000, that he had never been bankrupt, and that
he had no loans or credit card debts.
He was also convicted of the offence of a bankrupt removing property
contrary to section 354(2) of the Insolvency Act 1986, in that he removed
Pounds 104,356 held jointly by himself and his wife, possession of which he
would have been required to deliver up to the Official Receiver or trustee
in bankruptcy.
His wife was acquitted of aiding and abetting.
Mr Kansal came to the UK from India in 1967, and qualified as a pharmacist.
In 1977 he formed a company which flourished until, by 1983, it operated
some 20 chemist shops. At about that time he purchased a house with a Pounds
60,000 mortgage.
In 1986 the house was remortgaged. The original mortgage was paid off and
the balance invested in the business. By then Mr Kansal was encountering
financial problems. In February 1986 a finance company obtained judgment
against him in respect of a Pounds 4,000 loan, and the company went into
liquidation in February 1987.
On March 11 1988 a bankruptcy order was made against Mr Kansal. Five days
later the Halifax advanced Pounds 150,000 on the security of the house, and
a further Pounds 116,250 a week later.
Those advances formed the subject matter of the Crown's allegation that he
had misled the building society.
On March 23 his wife collected Pounds 104,356 in cash from the bank, being
part of the building society advance, and took it in a bin liner to India.
The Crown alleged that was done at Mr Kansal's instigation with knowledge
that the money should have been delivered up to the Official Receiver or the
trustee in bankruptcy.
On May 20 Mr Kansal made a statement of affairs pursuant to the Insolvency
rules 1986, and a narrative statement to the Official Receiver's examiner.
On July 29 at the Romford County Court, his public examination took place.
The Official Receiver asked him a number of questions and elicited
incriminating answers.
At Mr Kansal's trial the Crown intended to produce a transcript of the
public examination, and the bankruptcy file. Judge Rucker ruled that the
documents were admissible.
Mr Kansal's appeal basically was against that ruling.
The appeal turned on the proper construction of section 31 of the Theft Act
1968, and the impact of section 433 of the Insolvency Act 1986.
Section 31 provided that a person was not excused on the ground of
self-incrimination under the Act from answering any question put to him 'in
proceedings for the recovery or administration of any property, for the
execution of any trust . . . ', but that no statement or admission made in
answering the question should 'in proceedings for an offence under this Act'
be admissible in evidence against him.
Miss Arden for Mr Kansal contended that bankruptcy proceedings were
'proceedings for the recovery or administration of any property' or 'for the
execution of a trust'.
Accordingly, she said, while Mr Kansal was not excused from answering
questions in bankruptcy proceedings on the ground of self-incrimination, he
was protected in 'proceedings for any offence under this Act', ie the Theft
Act, his answers being inadmissible against him in those proceedings.
Miss Arden said the bankruptcy process was very much concerned with getting
in and distributing the bankrupt's assets and that the words 'for the
recovery or administration of any property' were apt to cover the duties of
the Official Receiver or trustee in bankruptcy, who also executed a
statutory trust. She said there was nothing in section 31 that excluded
bankruptcy proceedings from the ambit of the section.
Also, she said that the privilege from self-incrimination had been enshrined
in the law for centuries and if it was abrogated there should be a
counterbalance such as was found in section 31 rendering statements
inadmissible in criminal proceedings. She said it was not part of the
bankruptcy process to ensure that bankrupts were prosecuted, and the court
should shrink from the construction of the statute that lent support to any
such result.
Section 433 of the Insolvency Act 1986 provided that 'in any proceedings
(whether or not under this Act)' a statement prepared for the purposes of
the Act 'may be used in evidence against any person making or concurring in
making the statement'.
Miss Arden submitted that that provision must be read subject to section 31
of the Theft Act and that if there was conflict between the two sections,
section 31 must prevail. She said it was a specific provision giving
protection in a limited field, as opposed to the generality of section 433
(see Seward v Vera Cruz (1884) 10 App Cas 59,68; Blackpool Corporation
(1922) 1 AC 34).
Mr Crystal for the Crown submitted that there was no warrant for the
suggestion that section 31 embraced or was ever intended to embrace
bankruptcy proceedings.
He said section 31 related to civil proceedings inter partes, where a claim
was made in relation to property which had been acquired in circumstances of
an incriminating nature. The normal privilege against self-incrimination was
abrogated by the terms of section 31 in such proceedings.
Bankruptcy proceedings on the other hand, he said, had no lis. They were not
adversarial and the whole statutory scheme of bankruptcy had a different
purpose and objective when compared with civil proceedings properly
so-called. The objectives of the statutory scheme for bankruptcy, found in
the 1986 Act and the 1986 Rules, were to enable the bankrupt's affairs and
dealings to be investigated under court control; to provide statutory
machinery for collection and rateable distribution of his available assets;
and to rehabilitate him through the process of discharge.
He said the privilege from self-incrimination was abrogated in bankruptcy
proceedings, not by the opening words of section 31 of the Theft Act, but by
rule 6.175 of the Insolvency Rules - '(1) The bankrupt shall . . . answer
all such questions as the court may put . . . (5) The written record may in
any proceedings (whether under the Act or otherwise) be used as evidence
against the bankrupt . . .' Thereafter section 433 of the 1986 Act rendered
the evidence admissible.
Mr Crystal's submissions were right.
Section 433 was not a provision of general application subject to a special
exemption created by section 31 of the Theft Act.
It was concerned with admissibility of a special class of document derived
from insolvency in 'any proceedings' whether or not under the Insolvency Act
or the Theft Act.
The section was not concerned with privilege, but with the admissibility of
evidence. Its terms were clear, unambiguous, unequivocal and were not
subject to any exceptions.
In Mr Kansal's case, his privilege against self-incrimination was abrogated
by the insolvency legislation. Once that situation arose, section 433 came
into play.
Section 31 of the Theft Act was not capable of protecting Mr Kansal. The
judge was right to admit the evidence. The appeal against conviction was
dismissed.
For Mr Kansal: Mary Arden QC and Richard J Haworth (assisted by the
Registrar of Criminal Appeals).
For the Crown: Michael Crystal QC and Peter Gower (Crown Prosecution
Service).

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
The data processing department, principal conduit for management information
in large organisations, is in jeopardy. It seems unlikely to survive in its
present form much beyond the end of the century; unless DP specialists learn
to build new and more effective partnerships with their management
'customers' it may not survive at all.
This is the chief conclusion of a new study* from Pagoda Associates, a
London-based consultancy specialising in the training and motivation of
information technology staff. The decline of centralised data processing
will be accelerated, it says, by:
Shrinking computing budgets. A Pagoda survey in the UK revealed that two
thirds of big companies are reducing their IT budgets for the first time.
Decreasing staff numbers. The survey showed that more than half the
companies canvassed have cut the number of staff they employ while some
central IT functions have disappeared completely.
Declining influence. A trend in the past two years has been 'outsourcing',
passing over all or part of the organisation's data processing requirements
to an outside computing services company.
Among the reasons for the decline are a reluctance on the part of large
organisations to spend more on IT before reaping the benefit of heavy
investment over the past few years, coupled with disappointment over
attempts to secure a competitive edge through technology.
Pagoda says that in order to ward off the threat of their departments being
disbanded or devolved, IT managers are trying to establish a new partnership
with their 'customers' - business managers who request and make use of data
supplied by the DP centre. DP managers have been forced to come down from
the remote and isolated computing ivory tower to try to help the business
gain real benefits from IT.
The new partnership should ideally have three components:
IT management must take a wider role in business planning, helping to shape
and develop corporate strategy.
IT management should be increasingly concerned with overseeing the orderly
devolution of computing technology through the business, giving leadership
and guidance.
There may still be some data services which can be provided most
economically by the data centre and IT management should ensure the
efficiency of their operation.
The role of the IT director will change significantly, Pagoda says. There
are several possibilities; the IT director could become the computer
strategist, responsible for ensuring value for money in IT investments but
without service management responsibilities.
IT directors could become service managers providing commercial
cost-effective IT services to the business without responsibility for
identifying IT solutions to business problems. Finally, the IT director's
role could expand into a board-level position encompassing office services
and change management as well as IT services.
Whichever path a particular organisation follows, however, the numbers of IT
staff are likely to decline and the skills they will need will change
profoundly. Some argue that only 30 per cent of today's staff numbers will
be needed in 2000.

<TEXT>
Gordon Pettitt, managing director of BRITISH RAIL's Regional Railways
sector, surprised the transport community yesterday by announcing that he
was to retire in August after just two years in the job.
The imminent denationalisation of the railways appears to be the main
motivation behind his decision. As he explained yesterday, at 58 he is only
two years away from BR's compulsory retirement age. If he had stayed on in
the job, his departure would have come in the middle of what threatens to be
the biggest reorganisation in BR's history.
'I felt it would be better for the business to be led by someone who can
take Regional Railways through all the developments that will come in the
next few years,' he said. 'It is important for the staff to have
continuity.'
Pettitt, a railwayman all his working life, will be succeeded by Jim
Cornell, whose present title is director, technical standards. Aged 52, Mr
Cornell joined BR in 1959 as a student civil engineer and worked his way up
through the engineering side of the railway until he became deputy general
manager of ScotRail in 1984, and then general manager in 1986.
He was appointed BR's director of civil engineering in 1988, where he
undertook a review of infrastructure costs before he was made director,
technical standards, in BR's recent reorganisation.
Cornell, in turn, will be succeeded by Ken Burrage, director of signals &amp;
telecommunications engineering.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Denis Antoine, French investment bank Paribas' top man in Tokyo, has arrived
in London to head up the UK operation in succession to Francois de Rancourt.
de Rancourt, 53, had been in London not quite two years before he was called
back to Paris as Controleur General, effectively in charge of credit policy
for the whole group.
The long-term debt of Paribas was recently downgraded by Standard &amp; Poor's,
the US rating agency, largely due to a sharp increase in loan-loss
provisions. So de Rancourt's new role is a particularly crucial one for the
bank at this point.
Antoine's relocation to London adds another important dimension to a firmly
international career. He will be running an operation of some 500 people on
the capital markets side, and a slimmed down 150 at the branch - compared
with 150 in total in Tokyo.
Aged 46, Antoine had been in Japan since 1983, and has a Japanese wife.
In London, Paribas has fared better than many international banks, managing
to counterbalance exposure to the dismal recession-bound UK corporate market
with notable successes in equity sales and research and in derivatives
products, including swaps.
One priority for Antoine will be to continue integrating banking and capital
market services. Paribas is aiming to set up a more cohesive marketing front
worldwide - or, as some analysts would say, looking to break down rival
fiefdoms.
With Tokyo and New York already ahead of London in this respect, Antoine
will be perfectly familiar with the process.

Typhoid fever is a threat in many countries with inadequate sewage treatment
facilities and poses a risk to the indigenous population and to visitors.
Typhoid vaccines have been available for many years, but while these
vaccines have proved effective they often cause adverse reactions. Patients
also require several doses of the vaccine.
Now Pasteur Merieux, the world's largest vaccine manufacturer, has developed
Typhim VI, the world's first single shot vaccine against typhoid fever.
Unlike earlier vaccines which contain the whole bacterial cell, Typhim VI
uses only the part the bacteria which causes the disease.
The new vaccine is effective for more than 95 per cent of recipients,
provides protection for three years, can be safely given at the same time as
other vaccines and produces far fewer unpleasant side-effects. Merieux:

US cable networks typically provide viewers with the choice of around 50 TV
channels, ranging from re-transmission of local broadcast stations to
specialist premium pay-TV channels, writes Valerie White.
Now subscribers are being offered an additional range of 30 sound channels.
But unlike the TV channels, where the source and the transmission are
analogue, these sound channels are fully digital, bringing CD-quality sound
directly into the home.
To receive them a tuner, costing Dollars 199 (Pounds 110), is needed which
plugs into any cable TV socket. The output from the tuner is then connected
to the stereo system, or to headphones. A fully digital output is also
available for connection to a Dat (Digital Audio Tape) recorder.
Each sound channel carries continuous music from about 180 CDs catering for
most tastes and giving around six days of play without repetition.
The service is being provided by Los Angeles-based Digital Music Express
initially on two cable channels in Atlanta, Georgia and costs Dollars 6.95 a
month. Digital Music Express: US, 310 444 1744.

Japanese car manufacturer, has announced two new developments which should
help efforts to recycle and re-use the material.
One is a new decomposing catalyst capable of recovering oils from all types
of plastics including chlorinated ones which have previously been difficult
to decompose.
The other is said to be the world's first plastic composite which can be
reused more than five times. The new material combines a liquid crystal
polymer for reinforcement with easy-to-use thermoplastic. It can be used as
a structural material, for example in car frames. Mazda: Japan, 82 285 1030.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Technology: Fashion hits the factory floor - How colour
screens have brought manufacturing to life
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Recession-weary machine tool salesmen can be forgiven for wearing grey faces
but at least the sophisticated computer equipment that controls their
machines is beginning to blossom out in colour.
Long accustomed to working with black-and-white screens, users of computer
numerically control (CNC) machine tools are starting to resemble the
telly-watchers of the late 1970s.
In an industry where jargon comes by the bucketfull - and even CNC suppliers
have trouble keeping up with each other's impressively named new product
features - customers can at least ask suppliers one simple question: 'Is it
in colour?'
The answer is often yes, but the only problem is cost: colour costs hundreds
of pounds more than black-and-white. Even in a total machine tool package
costing a five-figure sum, the widespread use of colour has been hampered by
the extra cost - and during a recession the total package cost becomes
particularly critical.
It is a similar story with thin film transistor flat screen TV technology -
big savings in space compared with a traditional cathode ray tube screen,
but several times dearer.
Colour has been available for some years on CNC, and might seem like a
luxury on something so utilitarian. Compared with a Cadcam screen, after
all, a lot of the information on a CNC screen is by definition numerical.
The majority of CNCs sold by GE Fanuc Automation, the world's leading
producer, is still mono, says David Avrell, UK managing director. And that
will remain the case, he says, until the cost comes down.
The benefits of a palette of 256 colours, as is available on some CNC
equipment, look somewhat dubious in comparison with some of the far-reaching
technological developments in CNC over the past decade - the trend towards
open systems and a striking development in specialist software that allows
machine tool companies and users to customise their bought-in CNC equipment
and differentiate their machine tools from the competition.
But colour does have a role that goes a long way beyond aesthetics. As has
happened elsewhere in the electronics industry, and particularly in personal
computers, CNC suppliers have spent heavily to make their equipment easier
to use over the past decade, and colour can help the process.
Massimo Ziliani, head of US CNC producer Allen-Bradley's motion control
division, says: 'I see colour becoming something pretty natural on CNC
equipment.' Using different colour on a graphic of a complex part shape can
help the operator specify the right dimension for a particular profile.
As has been found in Cadcam, colours and shading make a 3D object more
readily understandable as a version of the real thing.
Even so, Ziliani admits it is hard to explain customers' desire for colour
in some factory automation applications. Allen-Bradley has been pushed by
users to develop a high-definition colour screen for a robot's operator
panel, which is used only for programming and is rarely visited when the
robot is working.
'I think the look or appearance of a nice screen with nice graphics is
something that is an image of high-tech,' he says. 'So there is a marketing
consideration here.'
If suppliers are asked to use colour screens in these applications, the
market in CNC on machine tools ought to have greater potential, especially
in small-batch production when the machine tool is being reprogrammed
frequently.
Flat-screen technology, meanwhile, lends itself to use in the machine tool
industry for a number of reasons. The quality of the display is one
attraction, says Avrell, and light tends to enhance the screen.
The saving of space could also be important in small machine tools, says
Ziliani, who otherwise remains a firm adherent of CRTs. 'I am still
convinced that a high-resolution CRT is cheaper and more readable, and hence
more effective,' he says.
Most CNC suppliers would agree with Terry Margetts, sales and marketing
manager at Cranfield Precision Systems (CPS), part of Powys-based Control
Techniques, that 'flat screen has got to come in, but when it's a sensible
price'.
CPS, which over the past three years has been developing a new mass market
system called Flexible Numerical Control, is sampling the flat screen market
regularly, says Margetts.
At present, he says, a 10-inch colour flat screen produced in volume would
cost Pounds 1,750 against Pounds 400 for a colour CRT. In black and white,
flat screens cost Pounds 300, against Pounds 125 for a CRT, so they are
becoming more viable commercially.
The CNC industry will, as usual, strive to give the machine tool builders
what they want and can afford. But CNC suppliers cannot do much about the
price of a flat screen. Reductions, Avrell believes, will depend on flat
screens penetrating markets outside machine tools, such as in buses and
aircraft where space is at a premium.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mention the name Michael Beckett and trouble is not normally far away. Hence
a few eyebrows may be raised by his appointment as deputy chairman of Watts,
Blake, Bearne, the world's biggest ball clay producer.
The 55-year-old ex-managing director of Consolidated Gold Fields seems to
enjoy getting involved with troubled companies and while he hesitates to
call himself a company doctor he confesses to being a 'very independent'
non-executive director.
When the institutions became worried last year about Jock Mackenzie's
stewardship of Tace, the environmental equipment manufacturer, it was
Beckett they turned to for help. He took over the chairmanship and sold the
company to Cambridge Electronic Industries for a handsome profit. A few
months later he had to take over the helm of Ultramar after the previous
well-paid chairman was ousted. Shortly afterwards, Lasmo acquired the
company.
Beckett is also trying to revive the fortunes of Monarch Resources, a
Venezuelan gold mining company, which launched a Pounds 19m rights issue
earlier this week. Beckett was brought in as chairman just over a year ago
following a major boardroom restructuring.
However, he stresses that his deputy chairmanship of Watts, Blake, Bearne is
a far less controversial appointment and is more akin to his non-executive
directorships of Ranks Hovis McDougall and BPB Industries.
Profits at what is in some respects still a family-run business have fallen
for two years running, and it was the big continental European shareholders
 -with around 45 per cent of the equity - who approached Beckett for this
position.
All the same, WBB is not another Tace or Ultramar and Beckett's appointment
further rounds out the board's expertise. Ingram Lenton, a former chairman
of Bowater Industries, took over the chairmanship of the company just over a
year ago.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Management: Confrontation up against collaboration - Sharply
differing attitudes to works councils in the UK and in Germany / Social
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Wilfred Kuckelkorn has worked for Ford all his life and is now
deputy-chairman of Ford Germany. Jack Adams, a former communist shop steward
at British Leyland, is deputy-general secretary of the Transport and General
Workers Union.
The abbreviated biographies of the top trade union officials at,
respectively, Ford Germany and Ford UK demonstrate the differences between
the industrial relations and worker representation traditions of the two
countries.
The German system of co-determination, with workers on the board at company
level and powerful works councils at plant level, integrates the workforce,
giving it power and responsibility.
To some British trade unionists, this is no more than 'company unionism',
albeit of a powerful kind. They claim their system of external union
officials and plant-based shop stewards is more flexible and representative.
The differences between these two traditions are currently holding up
agreement on forming a European works council at Ford, aimed at giving a
collective voice to workers from all six European countries where Ford has a
presence.
The Germans want Euro-works council representatives to be elected only from
Ford employees. The British want some full-time union officials to sit on
the 20-person council. A compromise will probably be worked out, and could
become a model for other Euro-works councils. How do the contending systems
work at Ford?
In the German plants, the employee-only, legally constituted, works
councils, elected from the whole workforce, have veto power over everything
from working time to bonuses and redundancies.
Kuckelkorn is head of the works council at the Cologne factory, which
employs about half of Ford Germany's 36,000 employees, and he also heads the
less important Germany-wide works council.
In his plant - 'the size of a small town,' he says - he is effectively a
co-manager alongside the plant manager. He cannot call a strike - that can
only be done by IG Metall, the national union, when industry-wide
negotiations break down. Unresolved disputes at plant level go to labour
courts, but this rarely happens.
Does he have too much power? 'I've never seen a works council destroy a
German company but I've seen managements do it,' he says.
Neither Kuckelkorn nor Ford are directly involved in the industry pay
negotiations. But Kuckelkorn sits on the board of Ford Germany and has
access to information affecting the company's future.
That encourages a pro-active attitude to management. 'We put forward a plan
for a slimmer management structure and pushed the adoption of a plan cutting
innovation time. Not all our ideas are thought through but we do affect
management thinking,' he says.
Adams and many British union officials do not approve of such role
confusion. 'Mr Kuckelkorn has a conflict of loyalties. Our priority is to
the members and not the company, although the interests usually coincide,'
says Adams.
At Ford UK, the most senior union representatives, such as Adams, 57, are
full-time union officials not employed by the company. Adams leads the union
side at Ford's annual pay negotiations but is also involved in any large
issue, like redundancies.
He claims to get as much information about the company from Ford UK as
Kuckelkorn, 49, gets as deputy chairman of Ford Germany. 'But I can use it
for bargaining, whereas he is often bound by confidentiality,' says Adams.
The Ford National Joint Negotiating Committee (NJNC) is the pinnacle of the
UK system - combining elements of the all-German works council and the IG
Metall negotiating committee.
On the UK's 50-man NJNC sit the country's top shop stewards and the motor
industry's most senior full-time union officials.
Inside each of Ford UK's 20 plants is a joint works committee with half a
dozen shop stewards and a similar number of management representatives. This
is similar to the German works council, except that the latter has
legally-defined powers and does not include management in its routine
deliberations. What the shop steward can demand in the UK depends on how
militant shop-floor workers are ready to be. The strike weapon, banned at
plant level in Germany, remains crucial in the UK - even if rarely used.
At Cologne, the works council, which meets at least once a week, has 41
members of whom 35 are full-time. Beneath them are 800 informal
representatives for individual areas of the plant.
At Dagenham in Essex, which has 11,000 employees, compared with Cologne's
17,000, there are 250 shop stewards elected by union members. Only three -
the senior shop steward for each sub-plant - officially work full-time on
union matters. Adams admires the power of IG Metall but believes UK union
officials are more accountable because they negotiate on pay at plant level.
The works councils in Germany are trying to become involved in pay, to the
irritation of IG Metall officials. But Kuckelkorn's influence on non-pay
matters is greater than the most powerful shop steward at Dagenham or
Halewood. He believes that power is part of the explanation for higher
productivity at Ford's German plants.
Eventually, the German model of the works council will probably prevail  -
because of its wider support in Europe. But a Ford Euro-works council, even
if it is recognised by the company, is no guarantee of harmony between
Ford's European workforces.
Co-ordination between countries to stop strikes is being undermined by the
transfer of work. When jobs are transferred - 350 research jobs recently
moved from moving from the UK to Germany - common interest soon
disintegrates.

pilloried as a member of the loony left. But Lucy Kellaway found Islington's
civic leader now cast in a very different mould / My Office
</HEADLINE>

The paint is old, the heating antediluvian, the fitted carpet too big. The
furniture is plain, shabbier than that for sale in the neighbourhood's
second-hand furniture shops. The view is of dustcarts, a school playground
and a council estate.
In the middle of this large institutional room is Margaret Hodge,
incongruously smart in a crimson suit and matching lipstick.
The leader of Islington Council, once a symbol of London's loony left, is
happy in these unpretentious surroundings. Hodge is now Ms Reasonable, a
self-acclaimed pioneer in public sector management. She runs a budget of
Pounds 300m a year and evidently does not think tarting up her office would
be a good use of the funds. 'I've never felt obsessive about my place of
work, so long as it runs efficiently,' she says.
The great turnabout at the council is apparent from the outside. The red
flag that used to fly from the roof has gone. So too has the bust of Lenin.
The banner that once screamed out the ever-mounting total of Islington's
unemployed has been replaced by a more modest, modern digital display.
Inside the grand old town hall are signs of Islington's equal opportunity
employment policies which used to be the subject of ridicule but are now
held up as a shining example.
The man at the reception desk is slightly handicapped; his black female
colleague says that someone from 'the Leaders'' office will be down
presently.
Hodge's own administrative staff consists of three women, working in a
cheerful, low-tech chaos of piles of paper and peeling posters. Their task
is to organise the Leader and to make sure she sticks to her over-filled
schedule.
Hodge gets to work at 8.30 on mornings that it is not her turn to do the
'school run'. Her day is an obstacle course of work and family
responsibilities: she has six to eight meetings stacked up between 8.30 and
3 - 'I never have lunch' - and then dashes home to welcome the children back
from school, only to return to the town hall for more meetings in the
evening. She is proud that these never start before 7.30pm, to make them
more convenient for Islington Council's growing numbers of working mothers.
'Mad, isn't it?,' she says of her timetable, while seeming to relish the
amount she gets done. 'If I have an evening at home, I sit down at 10pm and
write until after 1am. But we do have a social life. That is very important.
I also garden and play with the kids.'
How does she manage it? 'Women are much more effective at managing their
time than men,' is her answer. Her PA's explanation is slightly different:
'She's alway's wired, she drinks strong black coffee all day'.
In the office there are no signs of her four children: indeed there are no
clues as to the sex, class or position of the person who occupies the room.
She says she has deliberately confined her personal clutter to her bedroom,
rather than to her office. 'The way you survive as a woman with kids is to
compartmentalise your life. There is nothing of me here. I used to have a
rubber model of Margaret Thatcher that we punched occasionally, but that's
gone now.'
Her desk is small and shabby and replaces the big one that occupied the
Leaders's office when she took over 10 years ago. On it are piles of papers
and there are usually plenty more in the Sainsbury's plastic bags she
carries about with her. 'I'm not into status,' she keeps saying.
She has, however, insisted on a few plants, a sad collection in a white
plastic tub. Some of the pictures say something about her radical
principles: two African pictures that were gifts from 'my black groups' and
a series of posters deploring the plight of the homeless and advertising an
exhibition of 'A history of Black Pressure in London'.
However, Hodge is careful not to be seen as being over the top. In the days
when the tabloid press ran apocryphal stories about Islington banning black
rubbish bin liners, Hodge was frequently being taken apart. 'I have to make
sure I seem reasonable,' she says. 'What I look like is important,' - she
points at her PA in jeans and T-shirt - 'I would never come to work dressed
like that'.
Despite the old fashioned look of her surroundings - the only recent
innovation is the crate of Perrier - Hodge speaks like the most up-to-date
management consultant. She talks of flat structures, culture change, of
quality, of participative structures, empowerment, and of passing
accountability down the organisation. To prove it, she does not stand on
personal ceremony.
She lets herself be interrupted by her PA and doesn't bat an eyelid as
numerous colleagues burst into her office without knocking. However, this
clearly does not mean a free-for-all. At the constant round of informal
meetings held around the low Formica table - which could be with anyone from
local tenants to ministers - Hodge makes sure she is in full control. 'We
decide who should come and what the agenda should be.'
Where is it all leading? Doesn't she want to go into politics proper? 'I run
a budget of Pounds 300m - if that isn't real politics, I don't know what
is.'

FT  05 JUN 92 / The Property Market: A price on its high-rise head
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The issue,' said a banker wearily, 'is what is Canary Wharf worth? We have
no real idea.'
It was a frank admission for someone whose decisions had helped create - and
then bring down - the Pounds 1.3bn development in the London Docklands which
last month was put into administration. The complex number-crunching that
led to the appointment of administrators had produced just one conclusion:
it was not worth throwing good money after bad.
'We made some assumptions and concluded that we couldn't make Canary Wharf
viable,' the banker said. The main problem in arriving at a value on the
project was the uncertainty surrounding the recovery in the London property
market. 'None of us know where the market is going,' he said.
For all the uncertainties, the question of what Canary Wharf is worth cannot
be ducked by the bankers, administrators and potential investors considering
its future. While the range of estimates vary hugely, one thing is clear:
Canary Wharf is worth very little to an investor in its present state.
'The economics of the project require a hugely charitable act from the banks
to make the scheme stack up for any incoming investor,' commented County
NatWest, a broker.
The project can only support a modest amount of debt. On the optimistic
assumption that Canary Wharf is fully let at an average rent of Pounds 15
per sq ft (an additional Pounds 300m would need to be spent first to
complete the project), the development would support debt of just Pounds
500m, assuming an interest rate of 10 per cent. As matters stand, with only
11 per cent of the 4.5m sq ft project occupied, albeit on a rent estimated
at about Pounds 25 per sq ft, Canary Wharf can only service Pounds 94m of
debt.
The picture improves if the project's enterprise zone tax breaks, which
could total Pounds 400m, can be used. Even then, the shortfall in Canary
Wharf's ability to service its debt suggests that the banks' write-downs
could exceed Pounds 700m.
The scale of the immediate provisions might be reduced if an incoming
investor pumped fresh funds into the project and improved its long term
prospects by completing the current phase of construction.
Any new backer would receive no income from its investment; the investor
would have to take a long term view. A backer would have to gamble on what
Canary Wharf would be worth when firmly established in, say, 15 years. Given
the riskiness of the investment and the lack of an income in the short term,
any potential investor would demand a high rate of return - probably
comparable to that on venture capital investments.
Mr Richard Mully, a director of County NatWest, estimates that assuming the
project is fully let on rents similar to current levels of Pounds 15 per sq
ft, the maximum an investor should be prepared to pay for Canary Wharf is
between Pounds 150m and Pounds 200m.
Given the scale of the potential write-downs and the limited sums that are
likely to be provided by an outside investor, it might be in some banks'
interests to swap debt for equity.
The banks' long-standing aversion to converting debt to equity - which
damages their balance sheets and does not offer the tax advantages of
provisions - may be softening, according to Mr Mully. 'There is no short
term solution,' he says. 'Selling out today involves huge write-offs (and
getting back nothing at all). If banks can recoup something it would be
worth persisting.'
The losses incurred by Canary Wharf's developers, Olympia &amp; York, raise the
question of why the project was thought viable in the first place: how did
O&amp;Y persuade its bankers to fund the scheme?
The answer is illustrated by a slide used by O&amp;Y in a presentation to
bankers in 1990. Entitled 1990 comparable development economics, the slide
shows that the potential profit of building at Canary Wharf was Pounds 73
per 'buildable' foot, compared with a Pounds 232 profit in the West End and
a Pounds 91 loss in the City.
The developers based their argument on the fact that land prices at Canary
Wharf were cheaper than elsewhere in London, leading to total construction
costs of Pounds 355 per sq ft, compared with Pounds 805 in the City and
Pounds 685 in the West End. Construction costs, they added, would fall for
subsequent phases of the development as the burden of the infrastructure
costs were spread more widely.
Rents per square foot were expected to be Pounds 30 at Canary Wharf compared
with Pounds 50 in the City and Pounds 55 in the West End. Yields at Canary
Wharf would be comparable with the City, after taking account of the
enterprise zone's tax allowances. That gives a capital value of Pounds 428
per sq ft for Canary Wharf and thus a potential profit of Pounds 73 per sq
ft.
As late as February O&amp;Y was optimistic that the numbers would add up.
Indeed, in February it launched a Pounds 215m enterprise zone trust based on
a 600,000 sq ft building at 10 Cabot Square. The building was valued at
Pounds 215m, which covered the construction costs.
But the Cabot Square valuation was made on a special assumption - namely,
that the rent on the entire building at Pounds 25.61 per sq ft, had a
cast-iron guarantee from the developers. That, together with the
exploitation of the tax breaks, allowed the valuers to use a yield close to
7 per cent.
The reason why O&amp;Y's original assumptions and the Cabot Square valuation are
now irrelevant is that they vastly overestimated the project's rental income
and its ability to use the tax breaks. O&amp;Y thought that it would be able to
sustain rents of Pounds 30 per sq ft - and even push them up towards levels
in the City and West End. Now, the project would do well to achieve rents of
half that level.
Given the uncertain state of the Dockland's property market, even that
assumption may overstate Canary Wharf's value. Unless a building has a
prospect of being let, it is a liability, not an asset.

FT  05 JUN 92 / The Property Market: Croydon shows the way
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If one comment about Canary Wharf particularly wounded Olympia &amp; York, it
was likening the Docklands to Croydon. The irony is that the comparison is,
if anything, unfair to Croydon.
Croydon is the sixth largest office centre in the UK. Although it has the
same amount of office space as the Docklands - 10m sq ft - the vacancy rate
in Croydon is just 8 per cent, compared with about 50 per cent in the
Docklands. The Dockland's transport system is still embryonic, while Croydon
has 20 railway stations and two motorways on its doorstep.
In stark contrast with the Docklands, the growth of Croydon in the 1960s was
a triumph for its developers and Croydon Corporation, which fostered it.
But not everything is going Croydon's way. Office rents have fallen by up to
30 per cent in the past 18 months; and office vacancies are likely to
increase as leases expire and company relocations slow down.
Perhaps the most damaging aspect of Croydon is the appearance of its serried
ranks of tired 1960s office blocks. But if Croydon's 1960s architecture is
now heartily despised, what chance do the bland facades of the Docklands
have of standing the test of time?

FT  05 JUN 92 / Cut forecast in small accountancy firms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of small British accountancy firms is likely to fall by more than
5 per cent in the coming year, according to a survey released yesterday by
Michael Page Finance, recruitment specialists.
About 400 of the 10,000 firms and sole practitioners in the UK will be sold
and at least 100 more will merge, an analysis of the intentions of 945
accountants suggests. Three quarters of those questioned were small firms
with between one and three partners.
Statistics for the last year from larger and medium-sized accountancy firms
show revenue growth often below the level of inflation. Job reductions were
widespread.
In the two years to December last year, 7 per cent of firms merged and 9 per
cent acquired other firms, compared with 4 per cent and 9 per cent
respectively in the previous two-year period.
The number of acquisitions doubled in the north of England and Scotland
between the two periods, and declined in the south-east and south-west of
England.
Twelve per cent of firms predicted expansion primarily by merger or
acquisition, while 32 per cent saw little prospect of growing in that way.
The value of firms acquired has also been falling. More than four fifths of
those acquiring other practices use a multiple of their gross recurring fees
from clients to assess their worth.
The multiple being used by acquisitive practices has fallen from a range of
1.25 times to twice fees in the late 1980s down to between 0.75 times and
1.2 times this year. That partly reflects the greater risks that existing
clients will not pay their bills or remain loyal to the same firm. The
survey also showed that 85 per cent of firms considered that acquisitions
had succeeded.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Thurcroft miners propose buyout
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REDUNDANT miners from Thurcroft Colliery in South Yorkshire, which closed in
December, will today present British Coal with plans for an employee buyout
to save it.
The proposal follows an employee buyout of Monktonhall colliery in Scotland
last month. If the Thurcroft plan succeeds, it will be seen as confirmation
that colliery buyouts are a realistic option for otherwise doomed pits.
Earlier this month Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister, encouraged buyouts by
saying the government would help employees interested in bidding for mines
to fund the cost of preparing their bids.
The miners lost their jobs when Thurcroft closed in December and last month
formed a consortium, backed by Rotherham Borough Council, to rescue the
colliery.
British Coal has agreed to delay mothballing the pit until the middle of
this month and has asked for proposals.
Miners have already pledged about Pounds 150,000 to fund the buyout. The
consortium, which hopes to raise between Pounds 250,000 and Pounds 500,000,
was this week working to raise more from institutional investors.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Manx tax change planned to lift international appeal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUE STUART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ISLE of Man plans to reform the taxation of companies owned by
non-residents that conduct business outside the island, in an attempt to
attract international holding companies.
About 4,000 companies are registered on the island as exempt companies. They
are owned and carry on business outside the island; they pay an annual fee
of Pounds 250 and are not taxed on profits. No island resident may have a
shareholding in such a company, but each company must have a Manx-resident
director and company secretary.
New legislation will extend the range of exempt companies to include
Manx-registered public companies. The Isle of Man treasury said that would
allow island residents to hold a limited number of shares, but emphasised:
'We will not allow any Manx resident to shelter income in these companies.'
The new category of international companies will pay a minimum tax charge
equivalent to the current annual fee. There will be flexibility to have a
specific rate of tax applied, up to 20 per cent, which the island's
authorities say may be more appropriate for an international corporation
with a fixed global tax policy.
The new laws will link with a reduction, announced in April, in maximum
capital duty from Pounds 50,000 to Pounds 5,000. The government hopes the
measures will increase the island's appeal to large international companies.
The government also hopes the measures will encourage Manx-registered
non-residents' companies to change status and become international
companies. The annual fee for the island's 9,500 non-resident companies was
increased by Pounds 50 to Pounds 500 last month.
Non-resident companies do not need local directors and company secretaries,
therefore they have little accountability to Manx authorities.
The new measures will be contained in an international companies bill which
is expected to be in force before the start of the next tax year.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Kenya aims to rescue economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NAIROBI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
KENYA, its economy in turmoil, unveiled a budget yesterday aimed at
restoring confidence and winning back foreign aid suspended last November
because of economic mismanagement and failure to democratise.
Professor George Saitoti, vice-president and minister of finance, told
parliament he proposed to reduce the deficit for the year ending June 1993
to 2 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP) from 3.5 per cent at present
and 6.5 per cent last year.
This is to be achieved through stricter spending controls and limited
revenue raising measures. For the first time, Prof Saitoti acknowledged the
need to cut numbers in the bloated civil service and speed privatisation.
Prof Saitoti said Kenya would move toward import parity pricing and variable
duties on agricultural commodities, lowering of import duty rates,
marginally reduced individual and company taxation and more export
incentives.
Western donor organisations and governments suspended aid worth an annual
Dollars 800m seven months ago to pressure Kenya into radical reform of its
heavily centralised economy, notably its costly state companies or
parastatals.
The budget acknowledges the severity of the problems facing Kenya, which
recorded its first negative per capita income growth in eight years last
year, and seeks to resolve the fiscal and policy problems which led to the
donors' radical action last year.
Prof Saitoti, said economic growth had slumped in 1991 to 2.2 per cent (a
real per capita income decline of 1.3-1.8 per cent), down from 4.3 per cent
in 1990, primarily as a result of drought, low coffee prices and a squeeze
on public-sector imports forced on the government after donors cut off quick
disbursing balance of payments support worth about Dollars 30m (Pounds
16.6m) a month.
Prof Saitoti announced a slight balance of payments improvement because of a
26 per cent growth in export earnings, caused by a surge in non-traditional
manufactured exports, a squeeze on public sector imports and bilateral debt
reschedulings.

THE ARAB League yesterday accused Israel of having turned the impoverished
Gaza Strip into a 'huge prison' by sealing the narrow coastal territory for
11 days and cutting off its 750,000 Palestinian inhabitants from access to
work in Israel, their main source of income.
The closure, imposed after a Gazan had stabbed a 15-year-old Israeli
schoolgirl to death in a Tel Aviv suburb, has become bound up in the
campaign for the Israeli general election on June 23.
The ruling Likud party of Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, is afraid
another stabbing might follow the end of the closure, provoke a repeat of
angry anti-Arab riots and draw criticism from the opposition Labour party.
Yesterday, a Palestinian was shot dead in Bethlehem, in the West Bank, after
stabbing and wounding an Israeli policeman.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government expects the economy to grow at an average rate of
3.5 per cent annually over the next five years, according to drafts of a
long-term economic plan to be published this month.
The plan, prepared by the government's Economic Planning Agency, envisages
growth being led by domestic demand, including public and private spending
designed to improve the standard of living in Japan.
The expected contribution from domestic demand will be set at 3.75 per cent;
the net contribution from external demand will be negative.
This means that import growth will exceed export growth and that Japan's
trade surplus, bugbear of its relations with the US and Europe, will shrink.
Even though the plan has been drawn up in the middle of a sharp slowdown in
the Japanese economy, its conclusions are generally up-beat. It assumes that
Japan will pull out of the current downturn towards the end of the year.
The government is sticking to a forecast of 3.5 per cent growth for the
current financial year, which started in April, even though the Organisation
for Economic Co-operation and Development expects to see a far slower rate
of growth.
The government was watching the effects of a package of economy-boosting
measures, announced two months ago, including a cut in the official discount
rate and the advancement of planned public investment from the second half
of the financial year to the first.

<TEXT>
MR ENRIQUE ZOBEL, a Manila businessman who was a confidant of the late
Philippine president Ferdinand Marcos, claimed yesterday that the dictator
had gold deposits abroad worth more than Dollars 35bn (Pounds 19.4bn) - much
of it Second World War loot obtained from a Japanese general.
Mr Zobel, one of the most respected businessmen in the country, said in a
television interview that Mr Marcos, before he died in exile in Hawaii in
September 1989, was working on a trust fund that would assume control of the
gold deposits and 'retire the country's foreign debt'.
'I saw the actual certificates of gold bullion deposits. All those documents
that were shown to me are now in Bong-bong's possession,' Mr Zobel said,
using the nickname of Mr Marcos's son, Ferdinand Jr.
Mr Zobel said that besides the Dollars 3bn worth of gold deposits now frozen
in Switzerland, Mr Marcos had other gold deposits elsewhere in the world. In
all, these deposits were estimated by Mr Zobel to be worth Dollars 35bn.
Previous estimates of the Marcos wealth have been about Dollars 10bn. He
claimed the gold had come mainly from the wartime loot of General Tomoyuki
Yamashita, who is known to have died in the northern Philippines.
During the Marcos years, Mr Zobel was head of the property-based
conglomerate, Ayala Corporation.

THE CHINESE government, in marked contrast to its stated policy of opening

journalists in Beijing.
Mr James Miles, Beijing correspondent of the British Broadcasting
Corporation, has been banned from reporting while his journalist's pass is
being held by the authorities. Mr Miles was detained for five hours on April
30 after covering a protest by European MPs in Tiananmen Square.
The Japanese and German governments lodged protests with the Chinese foreign
ministry over the beating and detention of reporters on Wednesday. France
has said the treatment was unacceptable.
Reporters from TBS television of Japan, DPA news agency of Germany, and ABC
News of the US were detained for three hours as they attempted to report
from the square on the eve of the third anniversary yesterday of the bloody
crackdown on pro-democracy campaigners, in which hundreds were killed.
An ABC correspondent, Mr Todd Carrel, and a Japanese cameraman, Mr Atsushi
Yamagiwa, were beaten up.
The Chinese foreign ministry justified use of force because reporters had

BY far the most forbidding document for consideration at the Earth Summit is
the so-called Agenda 21, an action plan to clean up the planet which runs to
490 pages, with 40 chapters and no fewer than 115 specific clean-up
programmes.
But this weighty tome will also be one of the hottest items at Rio because
it raises the question of who pays for the clean-up. Although most of the
text was agreed before Rio started, the section on finance is still
completely blank, and Mr Joseph Wheeler, the UN official overseeing it says:
'The finance negotiations will be very tough. We'll not see the results
until the very last minute.'
The whole tone of Agenda 21 (so-called because it is targetted at the 21st
century) is based on the view that the world stands at a critical juncture,
and that it will have to 'change course' to survive - a familiar Rio battle
cry. The new course will be sustainable development, meaning that present
day consumption must not impair resources for future generations.
But Agenda 21 also asserts that poverty, and the gap between North and
South, must be overcome if the world economy is to flourish. Hence its
strong emphasis on the need for greater flows of aid money and technology
from North to South, something the rich countries are wary of.
One of the largest sections deals with ways of protecting all features of
the environment, the atmosphere, land, water, forests, mountains and so on,
some of which will be backed up by separate Rio treaties. It also addresses
the need for better management of waste: toxic, hazardous and radio active.
A further section discusses the role that various groups can play in
improving the environment: women, children, local authorities,
non-governmental organisations, business, scientists, farmers and even trade
unions.
Most of this is so obviously desirable that it was approved with little
controversy, though specific interest groups are agitating for improvements
in their pet subjects.
The big problem comes in the North-South issues. Many industrial countries
think Agenda 21 is tilted too much in favour of the Third World, and they
are worried that it could turn into a massive demand for aid. Some of them,
including the US, also resent a statement early in the document which says:
'One of the most serious problems facing the planet is unsustainable
consumption and production patterns leading to environmental degradation,
aggravation of poverty and imbalances in the development of countries.' They
see this as a direct attack on their economic policies and want it excluded.
On the other hand, Third World countries think Agenda 21 favours the rich
countries because, in their view, it is soft on trans-national corporations
and transfers of technology.
When UN organisers of the Earth Summit were asked to produce estimates of
how much it would cost to implement Agenda 21 in the Third World alone, they
calculated it at Dollars 625bn a year - a headline-grabbing figure if ever
there was one. This was not intended to be an aid demand, but it was widely
interpreted as such and did considerable damage to Agenda 21's prospects.
Of this sum, Dollars 500bn was supposed to come from the Third World itself,
which upset many of those countries because they thought the rich countries
should shoulder the burden. The remaining Dollars 125bn was supposed to be
in the form of aid from industrial countries, which upset them as well.
No one takes any of these figures seriously now, and it seems most unlikely
that they will survive Rio. Mr Gordon Shephard, an official with the World
Wide Fund for Nature, says: 'What matters is not how much money there is but
how it is spent.' But that is not to say that the industrial countries will
dismiss all requests for aid.
Many of them, including EC members, have agreed to make 'new and additional
funds' available, and the next 10 days will show how willing they are to
dress that up with hard cash. Dr Asnar Vogel, the director general of the
German Environment Ministry, says: 'Industrial countries have to give a
clear signal to the world that they consider themselves in a position of
responsibility, and that means helping developing countries.'
Agenda 21's final section proposes ways of ensuring that the work is carried
out. It proposes the creation of a Commission on Sustainable Development
which would be part of the UN and have the job of keeping up the pressure on
signatories. The UN General Assembly would hold a special session no later
than 1997 to review and appraise Agenda 21.

ARGENTINA declared three provinces in a state of emergency after the worst
floods in nearly a decade killed 28 people and forced over 220,000 from
their homes in northern Argentina, Paraguay and southern Brazil, Reuter
reports from Buenos Aires.
Mr Jose Luis Manzano, Interior Minister, said the Argentine government had
declared the northern provinces of Formosa, Chaco and Corrientes in a state
of emergency and was putting three other provinces, Santa Fe, Entre Rios and
Buenos Aires, on alert.
Heavy rains over the past two weeks caused the Paraguay, Parana and Iguazu
rivers to overflow, sweeping flood barriers away and inundating hundreds of
towns and villages on their banks.
Officials in Brazil said 26 people had died in the southern states of Santa
Catarina, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul where nearly 100,000 people had
abandoned their homes.
In northern Argentina, where two men were reported drowned, Manzano
estimated that over 80,000 people had been evacuated so far.
Paraguayan authorities stood by to evacuate the 40,000 inhabitants of the
town of Pilar, where the waters were threatening to break through flood
barriers. Around 65,000 Paraguayans from low-lying areas of the capital
Asuncion have been moved to emergency camps on higher ground.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Change in US forests may curb logging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Forest Service is to change its forest management philosophy in a
move that could sharply alter logging practices and help to revive
indigenous tree species almost wiped out by rapidly-growing softwoods.
Mr Dale Robertson, service chief, has instructed regional foresters to start
to manage the 191m acres of national forest under their authority as
'dynamic and complex eco-systems,' instead of concentrating on maximising
timber production.
The new policy is to lead to a 70 per cent reduction in clear-cutting, where
loggers clear an entire area of trees and brush, and to a greater use of
less intensive logging techniques that leave some trees standing.
At the moment, clear-cutting is used on about a third of the 800,000 to
900,000 acres harvested each year in national forests, and accounts for a
much higher proportion of timber volume.
The Forestry Service also aims to restore traditional North American tree
species, including east coast hardwoods and the western ponderosa pine,
which has been largely superseded by faster-growing species such as Douglas
fir and lodgepole pine.
Forestry officials said reduction of clear-cutting would lead to a
short-term drop of about 10 per cent in timber volume harvested, but added
that volumes would return to their previous levels over time, through
development that pays attention to variations in tree maturities.
Stable volumes would imply logging on larger acreages. This might be
difficult because of environmental challenges to logging of any kind on vast
areas of national forest land that shelter endangered species of wildlife.
Even so, some foresters argue there is ample scope for sustaining volumes by
thinning existing forests.
The exact consequences of the new eco-system in forest management policy are
difficult to predict, especially as it is by no means clear that Mr
Robertson will be allowed to proceed with his policy change by President
George Bush.
He likes to call himself the 'environmental president' but his
administration has usually considered timber industry jobs more important
than ecological concerns.
Industry officials argue that clear-cutting is not just the cheapest way to
harvest trees, but also the best way to ensure replanting.
'It's cheaper, but it is also often the best way to get regeneration,' said
Ms Anne Heissenbuttel, director of forest planning and policy at the
National Forest Products Association.
However, Mr Neil Sampson, executive vice-president of American Forests, a
conservation organisation, says that the Robertson memorandum would
represent a dramatic shift from the European philosophy of treating forests
as agricultural factories by planting acres of single softwood species.
'It's not a non-economic view of forest management - it's a view which says
people may not be powerful enough or smart enough to replace a natural
forest with an artificial forest,' he said.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Summit's arch-demon waves a sharp trident
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It was, Bill Reilly admitted, 'a character-building experience'.
The head of the US Environmental Protection Agency was the summit's
arch-enemy before he even arrived in Rio because of the US's obstructive
attitude towards the treaties. His eventual appearance on Wednesday
unleashed a barrage of hostile comment.
But the youthful Mr Reilly rose to the occasion with a highly accomplished
performance. He appeared at a press conference wearing a green flecked tie
and bright green handkerchief and fielded sniping questions for the better
part of an hour.
Reilly cuts a good public figure. He has well-chiselled looks, a fluent
tongue and a phenomenal memory for facts and figures. Every answer he gave
contained some supporting nugget, ranging from the amount of waste produced
per capita in the US (4lb a day), to the volume of US aid compared to other
countries.
But for many people it was also a poignant performance. He was, after all,
once president of the US arm of the World Wide Fund for Nature and is widely
believed to have accepted the EPA job because he believed George Bush's
claim to be the 'environmental president'. That has not turned out to be the
case. And Mr Reilly now has to defend the record of an Administration with
which he must feel deeply at odds.
The Earth Summit produced its first result yesterday - a treaty to limit
greenhouse gases which produce climate changes. But many admitted it fell
short of expectations.
President Fernando Collor of Brazil, the first to sign, said the complexity
of the negotiations had reduced its scope, though he stressed it was an
important beginning.
The treaty obliges signatories to come up with plans to limit greenhouse gas
emissions, but it does not, as first hoped, impose an actual duty on them to
reduce emissions.
However a group of 'like-minded countries' led by Austria, Switzerland and
Norway is trying to win support for a side declaration that would impose an
actual target of reducing emissions to their 1990 levels by the year 2000.
The treaty requires ratification by 50 countries. No summit participant has
said it will not sign, so it is certain to come into force.
ONE of the less welcome guests at the Earth Summit is Mr Michel Camdessus,
managing director of the IMF. Brazil failed to meet the first quarter
targets of its latest IMF accord in April and looks unlikely to meet the
next quarter with inflation remaining stubbornly at 20 per cent a month.
Economy Ministry officials are vainly hoping that in the interests of a
better climate Mr Camdessus will politely not mention the matter and instead
restrict his interest in things green to trees and plants.
Referring to Mr Camdessus as 'the Grim Reaper,' one official said yesterday
'if he starts talking economics he could really wreck the party.'
Brazil, which has never taken the second drawdown of an IMF loan, still
barefacedly insists 'we only sign agreements we can keep' - perhaps
something the UN conference organisers should bear in mind as Brazil rushes
to be first to sign summit treaties.

FT  05 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Regulation crossroads for US vehicle
makers - Environment and safety laws are set to lead to higher costs, but
also new opportunities for parts suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
US environmental and safety legislation could cost the country's motor
industry an extra Dollars 40bn annually in parts, materials and services by
the late 1990s, aspirant equipment suppliers to the North American market
heard yesterday. The aggregate figure works out at Dollars 5,000 for each
vehicle.
The effect of the changes will spread down to the 'aftermarket', the market
for spare parts, accessories and chemicals supplied to vehicles on the road.
Aftermarket requirements could provide business worth at least another
Dollars 40bn.
'We are living in a world of regulatory activity that is frightening,' Mr
Bob Miller, president of the US Motor Equipment Manufacturers Association,
complained to UK motor component executives at a meeting in Birmingham.
Yet Mr Miller's complaint has its silver lining for actual and potential
suppliers to the US original equipment market and its aftermarket. This was
made clear by Knibb Gormezano and Partners, consultants, in a report* on the
North American motor market, commissioned by the UK Department of Trade and
Industry and presented to the Birmingham meeting.
The report noted that environmental and safety considerations were one of
five background factors affecting both future vehicle production in North
America and 'the aspirations of potential off-shore suppliers'.
As part of the realigning relations between the motor manufacturers and the
component suppliers, much of the work on meeting higher environmental
standards would not be undertaken by the motor manufacturers. 'A large
proportion of the research and development into more
environmentally-friendly vehicles is sub-contracted to outside companies,'
said Knibb Gormezano.
facturers want urgent solutions to the environmental demands, 'any British
manufacturer which has, or could have, products which help meet the demands
will find a multitude of ready ears'.
But this does not suggest that the North American market is suddenly free
and easy. Manufacturers at the Birmingham meeting observed that the US
market takes just as long to penetrate as the Japanese motor market. The
leading British component manufacturers - GKN, Lucas, T&amp;N for example - have
been active in the market for years and have local manufacturing capacity.
Indeed, over the last two years, partly reflecting the relative strength of
the EC and the US motor markets and emphasising the growing globalisation of
the vehicle industry, British motor industry exports to the US declined in
value. In 1990 they were worth Pounds 1.18bn; in 1991 Pounds 772m. By
comparison, exports to the German, French, Belgian and Spanish markets rose.
While the US motor manufacturers may need need new equipment, the recession
has ensured that they will not be producing vast new numbers of vehicles.
Knibb Gormezano observed that the recession had caused an 18 per cent
decline in volume since 1988 and that lost volume was not likely to be fully
recovered until 1995.
The effect of the recession is the second of the factors affecting the
aspirations of potential suppliers. But the mere recital of numbers hides
changes which have been taking place in the US industry, most notably the
loss of share by the Big Three manufacturers - GM, Ford and Chrysler - to
the Japanese car makers. However, the Japanese manufacturers will use the
US, just as they are starting to use the UK, as a springboard for exports.
The third factor affecting new entrants to the market is exchange rate
volatility, not a new phenomenon. But currency shifts such as the 10 per
cent decline in the value of sterling against the dollar in February-March
1992 can skew margin and profit calculations.
A new surge of protectionist sentiment is the fourth factor. Knibb Gormezano
has noticed no shift in commercial purchasing practices because of it and
commented that 'Japan is very much at the centre of the debate'. But
problems could emerge for European companies if US restraint actions
designed to fit one problem are couched in multilateral terms.
Negotiations for a North American Free Trade Agreement between the US,
Canada and Mexico are the fifth factor. This may have the effect of shifting
more labour-intensive production to Mexico, but the main victim of this
process is likely to be the Canadian component sector rather than the
European.

FT  05 JUN 92 / World Trade News: EC plans quotas on Chinese footwear
imports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MOST European Community states yesterday decided in principle to impose
quotas on imports of Chinese footwear.
Trade experts have yet to iron out technical problems - including the thorny
question of whether to apply the quota to the lucrative market for training
shoes.
Big manufacturers, including Nike and Reebok, obtain a growing share of
their production from factories in China and have been fighting the measure,
which they say would increase costs, and possibly prices.
Trainers were included in the quota plan, even though there is no Community
production of so-called 'hi-tech' sports shoes, and therefore no political
need to protect EC manufacturers.
The footwear quota proposal is an important trade precedent which should be
followed by the harmonisation or abolition of national quotas on other
imports from China, Vietnam and North Korea - nations defined by the EC as
'state trading countries'.
At the moment, a patchwork of national measures exists in many import areas,
including bicycles, umbrellas and toys. The Commission argues that national
quotas are already inefficient and will be impossible to enforce once
internal EC frontiers are removed at the end of this year.
In the case of footwear, Brussels decided to harmonise rather than abolish
most national quotas, because many member states were worried about the
impact of Chinese imports on the EC footwear industry.
At yesterday's meeting, only Britain held out against a quota, although the
Dutch, Germans and Danes are understood to have technical objections.
Portugal and Spain, on the other hand, are pressing for more categories of
shoes to be included.

FT  05 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Japanese agree to buy more US
semiconductors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE electronics companies yesterday agreed to buy more US-made
semiconductor chips in an attempt to head off a damaging trade row and the
threat of US sanctions.
Japan's 10 largest semiconductor users, who account for half of the Dollars
20bn market, committed themselves to a plan to increase dramatically
purchases of foreign semiconductors during the next six months.
Foreign semiconductor sales in Japan have stagnated at just over 14 per cent
of the market for the past two years.
The US and Japanese governments agreed last year that foreign semiconductor
sales in Japan should reach 20 per cent of the market by the end of this
year, but it is feared that first quarter figures to be unveiled on June 12
will show a decline from the 14.4 per cent registered at the end of 1991.
Under the plan, the ten companies will provide US suppliers with
confidential semiconductor purchase plans in order to aid marketing efforts.
The companies agreed to issue internal company memoranda to all employees
expressing commitment to boost foreign purchases, and would provide copies
of the letters to the US industry.
The Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ), the industry
association, said yesterday its members would boost foreign suppliers'
market share by increasing purchases from foreign companies at a rate faster
than the expected growth of the market in the second half of the year.
The Semiconductor Industry Association, the US trade association, said it
would publish for the first time a monthly 'flash report' covering monthly
bookings data.
'We want to see action (toward increased orders) in the next 30 days,' said
Mr Wilfred Corrigan, chairman of LSI Logic, the US semi-conductor maker.
Action will have to be taken quickly in order to influence an investigation
of the US-Japan semiconductor pact launched recently by Mrs Carla Hills, the
US trade representative, and due for publication in August. A finding by Mrs
Hills that the Japanese were not living up to their side of the agreement
could be politically explosive during the US election campaign.
Mr Jim Nordling, head of semiconductor operations at Motorola, said: 'I
believe the Japanese companies are convinced that sanctions are right
behind.
'We have high confidence that the extraordinary measures that have been
agreed on today will result in significant increases in market share.'
Mr Nordling said the agreement was unusual because of the concrete nature of
the plan, and he expressed confidence that Japanese companies were committed
to it.
It remains to be seen, however, whether the Japanese users are capable of
favouring foreign suppliers at the expense of their traditional Japanese
suppliers, who are suffering from a downturn in the market and are desperate
to increase sales.
Mr Shin-ichi Itoh, of the EIAJ, said he expected market access would also be
improved for European companies, which have criticised bilateral US-Japanese
deals.
Stefan Wagstyl adds from Tokyo: Japan has asked Gatt to intervene in a
dispute with the European Community over EC anti-dumping duties on Japanese
audio cassettes.
The EC imposed duties of 14.7 per cent to 22.3 per cent on five Japanese
companies after concluding they were selling cassettes at unfairly low
prices.
Miti argues that the commission did not prove that European producers had
been hurt by low-priced imports. It also claims the commission has not
properly explained the levels of duty it imposed.
If arbitration fails to end the dispute, Miti could take the issue to a Gatt
dispute panel - the ultimate arbiter of such cases.
However, it is rare for Japan to resort to a Gatt panel since Japanese
officials prefer to settle arguments by negotiation.
The Commission said yesterday it was imposing provisional anti-dumping
duties of up to 75 per cent on imports of large electrolytic capacitors made
with aluminium from Japan, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
An EC inquiry found that Japanese producers were offering their product,
which is used in the electronics industry, at prices between 14.1 per cent
and 43.1 per cent lower than in Japan.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Kohl and Major look for way to
stay on road to Maastricht

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AGAINST a background of growing popular scepticism in Germany about European
integration, Chancellor Helmut Kohl and Mr John Major will today seek to
co-ordinate their response to the Danish vote.
There is a clear division among top government advisers over whether it will
be possible to press ahead with the plans without Denmark, or whether
changes will have to be made to enable a new Danish referendum to be held.
The key is whether it will be possible to separate the Maastricht treaty on
economic and monetary union (Emu), and on political union, from the existing
Rome Treaty. For any amendments to that treaty would normally require
unanimous ratification.
Some top German EC negotiators believe that it would be possible to press
ahead with Emu outside the Rome Treaty, removing all references to existing
EC institutions. They see this as a clear step towards a Community based on
'variable geometry' - different combinations of member states for different
functions - which they regard as inevitable in the light of the queue of new
entrants.
Thus those countries carrying on to a single currency would become an inner
core of the EC. Those who wish to pursue a closely-integrated common foreign
and security policy could also provide another. And outer rings might be
formed by eastern European countries wanting more than association, but less
than full membership.
However there are also German advisers who believe it will be possible to
accommodate the Danes without stepping outside the Rome Treaty. 'We have
some ideas, but we are waiting to see what the legal advisers in the Council
of Ministers' secretariat say,' one official said yesterday.
The official line from both the German and UK leaders is that the other 11
member states must press ahead with ratification, or lose the momentum of
the integration process. But they know that the uncertainty will cast a
shadow over the two other main issues on the EC agenda: enlargement and the
Delors 2 budget package to provide increased financial resources.
Mr Major is in an unusually strong position in relation to Mr Kohl, in the
wake of his election victory, and with Britain in a better position to
ratify the Maastricht treaty than Germany. In Bonn, the affair has become a
serious constitutional struggle between the central government and the 16
Lander, seeking to assert their control over EC policy.
While the two appear to share much common ground on the need to press ahead
with ratification, Mr Major has the more difficult and delicate task of
persuading the Chancellor not to undermine European co-operation by pulling
out of the European fighter aircraft project. But Mr Kohl is under heavy
domestic pressure to cancel the deal, widely seen in Germany as unnecessary
since the end of the cold war.
In Germany, public and private comments on the Danish vote have been
remarkable for their tone of understanding, if not open relief. In spite of
the commitment to European integration in all the main political parties,
there is an awareness that the public mood is increasingly sceptical.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Partners leave Danes to ponder
their fate - Community's strategy is to carry on as if nothing happened,
pushing legalities to one side
</HEADLINE>

FOR ALL the high stakes riding on the outcome of the European Community
crisis, caused by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty, the simple,
not to say simplistic, strategy of all 12 states is to try to carry on as
though the earthquake had never happened.
The game plan of Denmark's 11 partners is politics first, legalities later.
They hope to plod through the Maastricht ratification, negotiating such
tricky obstacles as the June 18 referendum in Ireland, the autumn plebiscite
in France, and the crucial November-December vote in the German parliament,
so that by year-end they will have notched up 11 acts of ratification with
which to confront the Danes.
Only then would the Danes be asked to choose. It would not be a repeat of
the question put to voters this week - do you want Maastricht's political
and monetary union or not? - but something more menacing. It could run on
the lines of: 'Since, by our acts of ratification, we have shown you that we
intend to transform the Community into Maastricht-style European union
(whether you like it or not), the old-style Community soon will no longer
exist. This gives you the choice of joining us in the union, or negotiating
some kind of associate status.'
The strategy would depend on maintaining that the rejection is basically a
Danish problem. It is a strategy in which the Danish government appears to
be conniving.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Danish foreign minister, said in Oslo yesterday,
before meeting his EC counterparts in emergency session, that he would not
be asking to re-negotiate Maastricht 'because we know that would be
impossible'. Echoing other ministers, he said: 'I think we all need a long
time for reflection.' What that means in practice is making the Danish
people sweat out, over the coming months, the consequences of their vote on
Tuesday.
What is psychologically worse for Danes is that they will be left pondering
imagined, as much as real, effects of their decision. For all the talk of EC
legal experts, poring over the complexities thrown up by the Danish vote, it
will probably be months before Danes get a precise idea of their isolation.
There are several practical reasons for this. No real isolation will emerge
until the 11 start chalking up ratification successes. In the meantime, as a
UK official said yesterday, they 'do not want to slam any doors or rule out
procedures which would prevent Denmark becoming a full member of the
European union eventually'. Nor is there any clear idea yet which door to
slam.
Whatever the Danes signalled this week, they did not vote to leave the
present Community from which, as the members with the highest average
income, they draw a net financial benefit. But a period of reflection would
be a deliberate ploy to leave the Danes in the dark, where imagined
nightmares are often worse than real ones.
Not everyone has been able to restrain themselves from being more explicit.
'If the Danes don't want to join us, and won't leave the Community
themselves, then we will just move the house,' said a French foreign
ministry official yesterday. According to this theory, which is gaining
currency, the 11 would denounce the Treaty of Rome, take its substance, add
Maastricht and leave Denmark in an empty wing of the new house called
European Union.
At first, according to this scenario, Denmark might share in much activity
of the European Union, particularly regarding the single market. But it
might lose, or have reduced, its representation in the Council of Ministers,
Commission and parliament. This might well jeopardise Copenhagen's planned
EC presidency for the first half of 1993.
As time went on, Denmark might find itself squeezed out of the single
market, or at least without a proper say in the updating of environmental or
social policy. That would be ironic in view of the Danish left's complaints
against Maastricht that it left Brussels too inactive in raising labour and
anti-pollution standards.
It would also leave Denmark worse off than European Free Trade Association
(Efta) countries which have joined the EC in the new European Economic Area
(EEA). This, imperfect though it is, gives the Eftans some say in shaping
future EC single-market laws that will form the core of EEA legislation.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Europe's bond markets face
upheaval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was broad agreement among fund managers yesterday that the performance
of European bond markets could be fundamentally changed by Denmark's
rejection of the Maastricht treaty.
In the chaos following announcement of the referendum result, most European
markets fell sharply, with a clear divide between losers and winners.
Italian and Spanish markets were worst hit, with bond prices falling by
about 1 1/2 points at the 10-year maturity on Wednesday and continuing to
slide yesterday. Bonds denominated in Ecu also fell sharply.
UK gilts suffered falls of up to a point on Wednesday but held firm
yesterday. French bonds followed a similar pattern but German bonds escaped
almost unscathed.
The underlying pattern is that high-yielding European bond markets - riding
high on in-flows of international cash as investors anticipated convergence
in the run-up to European monetary union - are most vulnerable.
Convergence theory is simple: with currencies fixed within the exchange rate
mechanism (ERM) the inflation and interest rates of European countries will
have to fall to the level of the country with the strongest currency in the
system - Germany. Since government bond yields reflect interest rates and
anticipated inflation, convergence theory states that bond yields should
also converge.
Believers bought high-yielding European bonds - such as Spanish, Italian and
UK government paper - anticipating that yields would fall towards German
levels. As bond prices rose, holders were presented with a handsome capital
gain.
At the level of pure economic logic, nothing in this argument is threatened
by the outcome of the Danish referendum. Whether the Maastricht treaty
stands or falls, bond yields should converge under a system of fixed
exchange rates.
'The ERM is going to remain intact, but problems with ratification of
Maastricht will highlight markets where the economic fundamentals are not
strong,' said Mr Keith Jones, head of fixed income fund management at Lazard
Investors.
Investment managers yesterday pointed to three main reasons for falling bond
prices:
Convergence theory was so popular that bond yields were running ahead of
economic fundamentals.
Inflows of international funds into Spain, Italy and the UK pushed bond
yields lower despite the fact that inflation and government borrowing
remained stubbornly high. In these circumstances there was always the risk
of a sharp correction.
The prospect of currency union under Maastricht was the main incentive for
European governments to bring interest rates and inflation into line with
their neighbours.
Economic convergence can be painful. If the goal of monetary union is
removed, or indefinitely postponed, there is less reason to submit to ERM
discipline, in particular the low wage settlements and high interest rates
needed to bring inflation under control.
'It was clear earlier this year that there was going to be disenchantment
with the rigours required to meet the Maastricht criteria,' said Mr Terence
Prideaux, fund manager at Kemper Investment Management in London.
Aside from the full-scale breakdown of the ERM, the biggest fear of bond
market investors is a hidden devaluation of high-yielding currencies through
realignment of the mechanism. Gains made by holding appreciating bonds would
be wiped out by exposure to a depreciating currency. With Maastricht in
place and the timetable for monetary union set, a revaluation of the ERM was
seen as unlikely. Any threat to that timetable fuels speculation that some
governments would be happy to see their currencies devalued to ease the pain
of convergence.
On Wednesday and yesterday, Italian bonds suffered from renewed fears of
devaluation, since the lire is one of the weaker currencies in the ERM. This
was also a factor behind the fall in UK gilts, although most UK fund
managers believe fears of a sterling devaluation are unjustified.
In the aftermath of the Danish vote, fund managers are again looking at the
economic factors determining government bond yields: interest rates,
inflation and anticipated supply of new bonds to finance public sector
deficits.
On this basis, markets such as France, Germany, the Netherlands and -
ironically - Denmark could continue to benefit from flows out of
high-yielding bonds. Yet Italy, Spain and Portugal could suffer. The
position of the UK gilts market is less certain, with political stability
balancing a weak currency and poor public finances.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: French voters 'will back treaty'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FRENCH will vote two to one in favour of the Maastricht treaty in a
referendum, according to a newspaper poll yesterday.
The poll in the Parisien buttresses the government's decision to submit the
treaty for ratification in a referendum, in response to the Danish No vote.
Meanwhile the conservative opposition parties yesterday displayed deep
differences over the Maastricht treaty. In the Gaullist RPR party, General
Secretary Alain Juppe formulated an ambivalent and uneasy attitude to the
treaty, in an attempt to straddle the gulf between anti-Europeans and those
moderately pro-Europe in the RPR. But Mr Jacques Chirac, the leader of the
Gaullists, is so embarrassed by the intense conflict within the party that
he remained silent for the second day running.
However, the government is aware of the danger thatthe electorate could
decide to use the referendum to register a vote against an unpopular
president, rather than in favour of the treaty.
Paradoxically, President Mitterrand was yesterday urged to put his
presidency on the line in the referendum, by Mr Francois Bayrou,
secretary-general of the centre-right UDF. 'I do not see how the president
can fail to take personal responsibility (in the referendum),' he said. 'And
I say that all the more strongly because I intend to vote Yes.'
While Mr Mitterrand remains unpopular, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, his new prime
minister, has climbed steadily in the opinion polls since his appointment in
April. The latest rating in Figaro Magazine gives Mr Mitterrand a popularity
rating of only 37 per cent, compared with 60 per cent for Mr Beregovoy, an
unprecedented gap between president and prime minister.
The classic precedent for the government's misgivings was the referendum of
1969, when the voters turned down President de Gaulle's proposals for a
reform of the Senate, and the president was forced to resign. In that case,
the voters knew that the referendum was really just a pretext for a vote of
confidence in the president.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Neighbours feel the chill winds -
Uncertainty is sweeping the Nordic region
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOSTILITY to European Community membership is sweeping the Nordic region
following Denmark's narrow rejection of the Maastricht treaty.
A few weeks ago the timetable for much of the region to enter the EC by 1995
looked secure. Now there is considerable uncertainty, with Sweden, Finland
and Norway needing majority approval in binding referendums before they can
join the Community. '
As many as 45 per cent of Swedes are opposed to their country's application
for EC membership, with only 28 per cent in favour, according to a poll
published yesterday. This suggests a rapid swing against the EC; in July
1991, when the then Social Democratic Prime Minister Ingvar Carlsson handed
in Sweden's EC membership application, about 60 per cent of Swedes supported
the move. Only 14 per cent said they were against EC entry.
Attitudes in Norway towards the EC have been evenly divided for some time
but they appear to be hardening against membership. An opinion poll
published yesterday in Aftonposten, the country's leading newspaper, showed
53 per cent of Norwegians now opposed EC membership, with 33 per cent in
favour.
In Finland public opinion remains more favourable, with the latest poll
finding 56 per cent of Finns in support of the membership application made
in March, with 31 per cent opposing it.
Sweden has seen the most dramatic shift in public opinion, largely predating
Tuesday's referendum in Denmark. Women have grown increasingly hostile to
the EC, with 40 per cent opposing their country's entry and 32 per cent in
favour. Many of them believe Sweden's welfare state would be endangered by
membership.
The most significant shift has been among Social Democratic supporters, 47
per cent of whom are against EC entry and only 24 per cent in favour even
though the party leadership under Mr Carlsson supports the cause. Mr
Carlsson blames Mr Carl Bildt, Sweden's right-wing prime minister, for the
growth of anti-EC sentiment.
There is little doubt Mr Bildt believes his radical economic programme to
make Sweden more competitive and market oriented is vital if the country is
to join the EC, in spite of being politically unpopular in the short-term
for increasing unemployment and squeezing living standards.
Mr Bildt had hoped Sweden's membership negotiations would be finalised by
the end of next year, with a referendum in time for the next general
election in September 1994. However, the Social Democrats have recovered the
backing they lost in September's election, with the latest opinion survey
giving them 43 per cent support.
Before he became prime minister Mr Bildt feared that the Social Democrats in
opposition would behave like the British Labour party after it lost office
in June 1970 and drop its pro-EC position in favour of a No campaign.
This still looks a unlikely, but the strains inside the Swedish labour
movement over the issue are likely to grow.
The same is true in Norway, where memories of a No vote in the 1972 EC
referendum still trouble politicians, particularly in the powerful Labour
Movement. The Labour party's conference in November is expected to endorse a
membership application, but the minority government's experiences over the
European Economic Area deal suggest that opening talks with Brussels will
detonate a furious national debate.
The Nordic governments will need more time to convince their voters about
the wisdom of joining the EC. Any rush to early membership could end in
disaster at the polls.

FT  05 JUN 92 / Blue Circle makes Pounds 241m cash call
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BLUE CIRCLE, Britain's biggest cement manufacturer, yesterday launched a
Pounds 241.6m rights issue to help pay for an acquisition to make it one of
Europe's largest manufacturers of domestic heating products.
In the latest of a series of cross-border mergers involving European heating
companies, it announced it had acquired for Pounds 124.9m Compagnie
Internationale du Chauffage, a subsidiary of industrial holding company Nord
Est.
Blue Circle proposes a one-for-five rights issue at 200p. Its shares rose 3p
to 247p following announcement of the issue.
The total purchase cost, including net debt of Pounds 81.2m owed by the
French company, better known as Celsius, is Pounds 206.1m. The remaining
Pounds 35m of the rights issue will fund expansion of the business. Celsius
is France's largest radiator manufacturer, a big producer of floor-standing
boilers, and large supplier of domestic heating products to Germany.
Operating profits of Celsius, which supplies 56 per cent of steel panel
radiators and 25 per cent of floor standing boilers in France last year were
FFr227m (Pounds 23.4m) on sales of FFr3.51bn. (Pounds 361m). Blue Circle
supplies heating products to the UK through its Potterton and Myson
interests.
Last November, the British group acquired Thermopanel, Sweden's largest
radiator producer, for Pounds 18.7m.
Mr Charles Young, chief executive of Blue Circle's home products division,
said the purchases of Celsius and Thermopanel would make the group the
second-largest European supplier of radiators behind Stelrad.
Mr Young said: 'There has been a gradual harmonisation of European standards
in the manufacture of domestic heating products. This has been reflected in
the consolidation taking place in the European market.'
Last month Germany's Robert Bosch conglomerate successfully bid Pounds
71.8m for control of Worcester Group, the British central heating boiler
maker. Earlier this year Wolseley, the Midlands-based engineering group,
paid FFr931m (Pounds 95m) for Brossette, a large French heating and
plumbing supplier. In 1990 Hepworth, the UK building materials and home
products group, paid Pounds 155m for Saunier Duval, the French boiler
manufacturer.
The rights issue has been fully underwritten by Baring Brothers. Brokers are
Cazenove and Hoare Govett Corporate Finance.

FT  04 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Telecom proposals hit C &amp; W
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE market registered its disappointment with details of the new telecoms
agreement between Hong Kong Telecom and the Hong Kong government by marking
down shares in Cable &amp; Wireless (C &amp; W), which owns a 57.5 per cent stake of
Hong Kong Telecom. Hong Kong is easily the largest revenue earner for C &amp; W.
By the close, C &amp; W was 14 lower at 554p on good turnover of 2.6m shares.
Telecoms specialists said the market was disturbed by the proposed 8 per
cent reduction in international call prices imposed by the government,
although it was pointed out that this was also following a trend in
international telecom markets.
Other details of the agreement were much as expected, said Mr John E.
Clarke, telecoms analyst at Daiwa Securities, the Japanese-owned securities
house. C &amp; W is scheduled to report preliminary figures on June 17.
Reed pleases
Better than forecast 1991-92 results prompted Reed International to rise
against the market on heavy turnover. The publisher announced profits for
the year to March of Pounds 232m against forecasts of Pounds 213m to Pounds
220m.
Analysts said the headline figure was good and even when a Pounds 9m pension
credit and a Pounds 5.5m positive translation (foreign currency) gain was
stripped out, the results were still towards the upper end of expectations.
The market shrugged off a cautious outlook for the coming year from chairman
Mr Peter Davis who said Reed's optimism at its interim results had been
premature so he was reluctant to forecast. SG Warburg which has been a
strong buyer of Reed for some time, on the back of an advertising turnaround
in the US upgraded its forecast for the year to March 1993 by Pounds 9m to
Pounds 267m. However, James Capel is less enthusiastic feeling that, in the
short term, the share price is 'up with events.' The shares were 16 higher
at one stage and closed 6 better at 580p.
The 6.6 per cent improvement in full year profits from Siebe, ahead of
market expectations, helped the shares jump 12 to 739p, making it the best
performing FT-SE stock of the day. A company presentation at Kleinwort
Benson yesterday afternoon was reported to have gone down well. Several
brokers moved to upgrade current and following year profit expectations
after the results.
Shares in submarine and warship builder VSEL soared, adding 37 to 455p, to
make it the best market performance of the day, after the company reported
figures up 17.6 per cent, and expressed confidence that the UK will order a
fourth trident submarine.
Improved traffic figures for May boosted British Airways, and the shares
hardened 3 to 288p.
Favourable sentiment returned to TI Group with reports that UBS Phillips &amp;
Drew had turned positive on the stock. The shares added 12 to 357p, which
boosted the performance of its bid target Dowty Group, 3 up at 176p.
Turnover in USM-listed Menvier Swann rose sharply and the shares added 21 to
430p, after Credit Lyonnais Laing bypassed the company's broker UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew to place 19 per cent of the company's equity.
MEPC, among the UK's second largest property groups, was the biggest faller
among the Footsie constituents, losing 14 to 330p, or just over 4 per cent.
However, turnover in the stock was a very thin 262,000. The fall was
triggered by news that Moody's, the credit agency, had downgraded MEPC's
long term debt, some Pounds 380m-worth, from A-1 to A-2.
Dealers said the shares had run up recently on the back of rather spurious
takeover rumours.
The battle for control of Midland Bank continued to dominate the banking
sector with many speculators convinced that Lloyds Bank will signal its
intention of bidding well in excess of 500p a share for Midland after the
Lloyds board meets tomorrow.
Midland shares responded by moving up 5 more to 457p on heavy turnover of
7.9m, helped by further keen support from mainly US-sourced arbitrageurs.
Lloyds, meanwhile rose 6 to 438p on 2.5m.
The view that a Hongkong Banking victory in the Midland takeover battle
would push Lloyds into launching a bid for another of the big UK banks led
to keen speculative support for Royal Bank of Scotland and TSB, despite the
widespread view of bank analysts that Lloyds would be most unlikely to
undertake such a move.
TSB rose 2 1/2 to 147p on heavy turnover of 10m while Royal Bank eased to
203p on strong turnover of 5.5m shares. NatWest Bank slipped 2 to 365p
despite more profit upgrades.
Shares in Sturge, the Lloyds underwriter, plummeted 59 to 111p, after being
as low as 90p, following the halved interim dividend, the chairman's
forecast that full year profits would be sharply lower and that the
full-year payment would receive similar treatment. JIB Group dropped 5 to
195p and Lowndes Lambert 11 to 309p in sympathy.
New York continued to cast a jaundiced eye over the pharmaceutical sector
following worrying projections from Bristol-Myers Squibb on Tuesday and the
scepticism affected the UK sector. Glaxo failed to benefit from news that
its top-selling drug Zantac had received approval by the US Food and Drug
Administration for a broader use. The shares fell 14 1/2 to 756p. SmithKline
Beecham lost 20 to 904p.
ICI was not helped by news that the EC is to investigate the sale of its
nylon division to Du Pont of the US. The shares fell 11 to 1328p.
Brewers and drinks companies followed the market down, with some big
international companies losing ground on nervous US selling after the Danish
Maastricht vote. Grand Metropolitan, with more US shareholders than the
other international drinks groups, fell 15 to 493p, while Guinness slipped
10 to 598p and Allied-Lyons a similar amount to 649p. Regional brewer
Marston Thompson fared rather better, gaining 9 to 254p on news of a trading
agreement with Bass, down 12 at 611p.
Laura Ashley, slipped a penny to 93p, failing to react to comments made in
New York by Mr Andrew Higginson, the finance director. He said Laura Ashley
should earn Pounds 7m to Pounds 8m profits this year on flat revenues, after
squeezing inefficiencies out of the company. It reported a Pounds 9.1m loss
last year, when making an exceptional restructuring provision.
Woolworths to B&amp;Q holding company Kingfisher gave up 9 to 545p as the
chairman told the group's annual meeting 'as ever, the challenge now is to
keep ahead of the game in a trading environment which as yet has shown no
signs of any substantial recovery.' Boots, with results due today, gained 5
to 490p.

FT  04 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow bides its time in advance
of jobs data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AMID uncertainty about the outlook for share prices, US stock markets traded
in a narrow range yesterday as investors nervously awaited tomorrow's
important May jobs data, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 10.89 at 3,406.99. The
index would have ended higher but for a late sell-off in the final minutes
which lopped almost 15 points off the Dow. The more broadly based Standard &amp;
Poor's 500 finished up 1.08 at 414.58, the Amex composite up 1.70 at 395.65,
and the Nasdaq composite up 0.75 at 589.93. Turnover on the NYSE was 216m
shares.
After breaking through the 3,400 barrier on the Dow at the start of the
week, investors were disappointed that the market did not add to those gains
on Tuesday. Analysts said that the failure of shares to advance further
suggested that, until there is fresh evidence of economic strength or
improved corporate profitability, stock markets were unlikely to gain much
more ground in the short term.
Among individual stocks, General Motors rose Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 41 3/4
in heavy trading after the carmaker said that, as part of its cost-cutting
drive, it would open to fresh bids virtually all of its contracts with
suppliers. The other two big car stocks were also firmer, with Ford up
Dollars  3/4 at Dollars 46 3/4 and Chrysler Dollars  1/2 higher at Dollars
19 7/8 .
McDonnell Douglas fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 39 1/8 on reports that over
the past few trading days a major institutional shareholder was looking
either to trim its holdings or to move out of the stock altogether.
Drug stocks, which took a hammering on Tuesday in the wake of a profits
warning from Bristol Myers Squibb, were mixed. Bristol Myers eased Dollars
1/8 to Dollars 66 3/8 , Merck held steady at Dollars 49 5/8 , Pfizer added
Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 71 3/4 , Upjohn fell Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 33 1/2
, Glaxo was unchanged at Dollars 27 1/4 , as was Schering-Plough, at Dollars
50 5/8 .
On the Nasdaq market, Borland International fell Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 49
3/8 in heavy trading after analysts at two broking houses, Donaldson, Lufkin
&amp; Jenrette and Goldman Sachs, lowered their earnings estimates for the
company's first fiscal quarter ending this month.
Both said that they had changed their estimates because they were not sure
whether Borland's new Paradox 4.0 product would reach retailers during the
current quarter.
Advanced Telecommunications, which revealed on Tuesday that it was in merger
talks, jumped Dollars 2 1/2 to Dollars 22 1/2 in 4m shares after the company
entered a stock swap merger pact with LDDS Communications, down Dollars 2
3/8 at Dollars 29 1/4 .
Egghead Software fell Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 20 1/4 in busy trading on
news of fiscal fourth quarter profits that were slightly lower than a year
ago.
Durr-Fillauer rose Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 22 after it was announced that
Cardinal Distribution will acquire the company's wholesale drug unit for
Dollars 166.5m in stock. Cardinal rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 29 3/4 on
the news.
Canada
TORONTO stocks closed about where they started, in active trading. Based on
preliminary data, the TSE 300 was off 2.86 points, or 0.08 per cent, to
3,407.34. Advancing issues were ahead of declines 285 to 248, volume rose to
30.6m shares from the previous 25.8m, and trading value of CDollars 374.6m
was above Tuesday's CDollars 327.5m.
Among the sub-indices, nine were higher and five lower. The day's biggest
gain was recorded by the mining group, up 1.11 per cent on index.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe plans to improve
availability of prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe)
yesterday announced plans for revitalising the UK equity options market in
response to a survey of members.
Volume in the ailing market for individual UK stock options has improved
somewhat since Liffe merged with the London Traded Options Market earlier
this year. For example, volume in individual stock options reached 432,000
contracts in May, compared with 360,000 a year before. However, the market
is still felt to be far from achieving its potential.
The main problem identified by members was the poor availability of prices
in the stock options market, which was considered an even greater handicap
than lack of liquidity.
Consequently, Liffe plans to address the issue of price dissemination by
developing systems and procedures to distribute accurate and up-to-date
prices for equity options.
A pilot 'Autoquote' system is already in place for index options, and will
be extended to individual stock options. However, traders said the system
has experienced some teething problems, and the inclusion of many complex
series of stock options could be difficult.
The survey also identified demand for longer-dated options, both in index
and individual stock products. A study will be carried out to identify which
products are needed.
Other priorities include education and promotion among both retail and
institutional investors, and a fresh look at liquidity and trading
arrangements. A more detailed plan of action is now being prepared.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Danish referendum triggers widespread
sell-off across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN and SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN bond markets were sent reeling yesterday following the Danish
referendum on European union.
The Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty has thrown the future of
monetary union into doubt and consequently destroyed the theory of
convergence, which has driven European bond markets for the past few years.
If European monetary union is no longer a certainty, the rationale for
European economies to move closer together - causing rates in
higher-yielding markets to fall - evaporates.
The Ecu bond market bore the brunt of yesterday's sell-off, although prices
regained about  1/2 point after suffering losses of as much as two points.
The new issues market in Ecus is now closed for the foreseeable future,
reversing its recent substantial growth. Dealers said liquidity had dried up
as participants tried to sell bonds. Since many traders had expected the
treaty to be ratified by Denmark, prompting a rally in the Ecu bond market,
there were numerous long positions, which proved difficult to liquidate.
On the Matif, the Ecu bond future fell the maximum 1 1/2 points, triggering
temporary suspension of the contract. When trading reopened, the price
rallied about 18 basis points to close at 105-92.
'Unless we see a quick solution, the risks are very severe, compared with
other markets,' said Mr Neil Rogers, an analyst at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew.
THE Italian government bond market slumped by over 1.5 points as investors
scrambled to move out of high-yielding bonds in the wake of the Danish
referendum.
The futures contract settled 160 basis points lower in trading of 62,000
lots, but finished off the day's lows.
The May 2002 bond ended at 96.97-97.04, well below the previous day's close
of 98.08-98.11, while the Liffe September BTP contract settled at 96.69,
against 98.29 on the previous day.
UK government bonds plummeted over 1 point following Denmark's vote and the
announcement that France now intends to hold a referendum on treaty
ratification.
The outcome of the Danish referendum raised fears of a realignment in the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System and led to concern
in the gilt market over the ease with which the government will be able to
fund the public-sector borrowing requirement in future.
Long-dated gilts showed the sharpest falls, with the benchmark 11 3/4 per
cent due 2003/07 dropping from 117 7/8 to 116 5/8 . At the shorter end of
the market, the 10 per cent gilt due 1994 fell from 101 1/2 to 101 11/32 .
The Liffe gilt futures contract fell from 99.13 to 98.16. Volumes were very
heavy at about 70,000 contracts.
Mr Nigel Richardson, economist at SG Warburg, said Denmark's vote raised
fears of a realignment of the EMS currencies. 'If you are looking for who
might be desperate to devalue, the UK has to be on the list of candidates,'
Mr Richardson said, pointing to the UK's inflation and current account
problems.
THE French bond market held up better than most other markets apart from
Germany, although prices fell about  1/2 point on an announcement that
France will hold a referendum on the Maastricht treaty later this year. The
French government bond contract on the Matif ended  3/4 point lower at
107.78.
The French market came through better than most mainly because of strong
economic fundamentals, which convinced traders that the market did not rely
on the constraints of monetary union. 'Markets like France and Holland have
independent credibility,' said one analyst.
THE German bond market was the main beneficiary of the uncertainty over the
future of European monetary union yesterday, with dealers reporting a strong
rise in bunds at the start of trading.
'There was a marked flight to low-yielding, non-converging instruments such
as bunds,' said one dealer.
The Liffe bund futures contract opened at 87.98 and rose to 88.07 within an
hour of the market opening. After dropping to a low of 87.61, the future
ended the day around 87.75. Volumes in the futures market were high.
THE Nordic government bond markets dropped over 1 point initially, but later
made some recovery as investors looked for bargains.
Danish bonds dropped 2 points on Tuesday evening after the referendum
results came out. The 9 per cent 2000 bond closed at 101.90 on Tuesday,
opened at 99.60 yesterday, and ended the day at 100.30 to yield 8.93 per
cent.
JAPANESE government bond prices climbed yesterday as the yen strengthened
against the US dollar following the Bank of Japan's intervention in the
foreign exchange markets.
The dollar opened at Y127.00 and ended at Y126.90 in Tokyo, but later moved
to Y127.50 in London trading.
The benchmark No 129 JGB opened with a yield of 5.505 per cent and closed at
5.485 per cent. In the futures market, the September contract climbed from
its opening level of 101.85 to reach a high of 102.08, but traders said this
marked a strong resistance level, and the futures contract fell back on
profit-taking to close at 101.95.
US Treasury markets settled down yesterday after some early profit-taking in
the wake of Tuesday's late rally on the Federal Reserve's surprise coupon
pass. Prices were left little changed in subdued trading.
By late afternoon, the benchmark 30-year government issue was down  1/8 at
101 13/32 , yielding 7.870 per cent. The two-year note was slightly firmer,
up  1/32 at 99 7/8 , yielding 5.175 per cent.
The market generally ignored the day's economic news - a 1 per cent increase
in factory orders during April, and an upward revision in annual
unemployment figures. Investors remained reluctant to trade ahead of
tomorrow's key employment report for May.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Swedish borrower postpones launch of
Dollars 500m issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURBULENT conditions dissuaded borrowers from launching new issues in the
international bond markets yesterday and caused the postponement of at least
one substantial Eurodollar deal planned for today.
The Swedish national housing association, SBAB, decided not to launch a
Dollars 500m five-year bond issue. Nomura International, which had a mandate
to lead-manage the issue, said the borrower was unwilling to launch a new
issue against a background of volatile Scandinavian financial markets.
However, syndicate officials are expecting a number of substantial new
issues in US and Canadian dollars over the next few days.
Ontario Hydro announced plans to launch a global bond issue of at least
CDollars 1.5bn. The final terms and maturity were still under discussion
yesterday, but the deal will be joint lead-managed by Merrill Lynch, Goldman
Sachs, Nomura and Wood Gundy.
Other regular borrowers - including Finland - are also looking to raise
substantial funds from the Euromarket, with most favouring large,
dollar-denominated issues.
Meanwhile, Isveimer, the Italian development bank for southern Italy, became
the latest financial institution to raise floating-rate funding in the
Eurodollar sector.
The borrower launched a Dollars 125m three-year paper which pays 40 basis
points over the six-month London interbank offered rate. Wholly underwritten
by Credit Suisse First Boston, bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed
rate of 99.66 and were held at this level until late afternoon.
Banco de Credito Nacional (BCN) became the latest in a line of Brazilian
banks to tap the Eurodollar sector, raising Dollars 60m two-year funding in
a deal lead-managed by Chase Investment Bank.
The bonds pay a semi-annual 10.5 per cent coupon and were re-offered to
investors at a fixed price of 99.06, where the yield was 10.94 per cent. At
launch, this was around 540 basis points more than the yield available on
three-year US Treasury notes.
Even by the standards of Latin American borrowers, the paper offered an
enticingly high yield. Bonds issued by other Brazilian banks yield around 10
per cent or less in the secondary market. BCN is one of the larger Brazilian
commercial banks, with assets of around Dollars 2.9bn.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: UK plays down capital adequacy
hopes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BRITISH government last night sought to play down expectations that an
EC capital adequacy directive might be agreed by EC ministers next week.
Mr Anthony Nelson, junior Treasury minister, warned the EC against rushing
ahead to set a solution in stone on the grounds that it could damage the
wider movement towards international convergence.
Britain was concerned that the requirements finally agreed should be
appropriately tailored to the different kinds of business the directive
covered, Mr Nelson said.
A simple blanket application to securities business of requirements that
were designed for long term and illiquid banking risks would do unnecessary
damage to key participants for no corresponding prudential benefit.
Hopes had been raised that EC ministers would be asked to give their formal
approval to the directive on June 9, following last month's tabling of a
compromise replacing a so-called 'hard limit' on the exposures taken on by
investment firms with a more flexible limit.
Portuguese representatives may be particularly keen to reach a broad
political agreement on the issue before the Portuguese presidency of the EC
ends this month, it had been suggested.
Mr Nelson welcomed the Commission's recently proposed draft directive on
deposit protection, while warning that the government had concerns about
certain details.
He cautioned that the end-1992 target-date for a decision on the site of the
European Monetary Institute and the European Central Bank was very
ambitious.
He was responding to comments on the future of British banking within the EC
made by Sir Thomas Arnold, the Conservative MP for Hazel Grove.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: BHP decision boosts Foster's
shares

<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing Group shares rose 8 cents to a 19-month high of ADollars
2.08 yesterday as Australian investors showed their support for a decision
by Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) to put Mr John Elliott's International
Brewing Investments (IBI) into receivership.
Analysts said BHP's action had laid the groundwork for a significant
recovery in the value of Foster's shares, which have been depressed by the
financial instability of IBI and International Brewing Holdings (IBH), its
privately-owned parent.
BHP shares closed unchanged at ADollars 14.40, indicating that investors
believe BHP has the financial strength to carry out its pledge to stabilise
Foster's by doubling its exposure to the group to more than ADollars 2bn
(USDollars 1.53bn).
BHP appointed receivers to IBI on Tuesday after Mr Elliott failed to produce
a plan to repay its preference investment of more than ADollars 1bn.
Mr Elliott controlled 32 per cent of Foster's through IBI, and a further 6
per cent was directly owned by IBH, a private company established by
Foster's managers in 1989.
IBH acquired loans of about ADollars 2.6bn to finance the acquisition of its
Foster's shareholding, which was worth about ADollars 1.6bn when the
receivers moved in. The company was unable to meet interest payments because
of a lack of dividends on the Foster's shares, its only asset.
Mr Elliott is expected to return to Australia from New York shortly to
discuss the receivership with Mr David Crawford, the KPMG Peat Marwick
accountant who has been appointed joint receiver of IBI.
BHP is believed to be keen to develop proposals for a merger with Foster's
put forward last month by SA Brewing.
Meanwhile, BHP said talks were continuing with a syndicate of banks led by
Hongkong Bank Australia, which is owed ADollars 1.2bn by IBI. BHP has
offered to buy the debt to prevent a dispute over security which could
destabilise Foster's.

THE Australian government and Qantas yesterday signed heads of agreement for

Australian institutions and a flotation of the remaining 50 per cent.
Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman, said the sale value of the merged airline

AXA, one of France's largest insurance groups, has increased its wine

of south-west France, produces one of France's most famous Sauternes.
The chateau, in which Axa is acquiring a 51 per cent stake, has an estate of

ZURICH Insurance, which has expanded rapidly in the US in recent years, is

we believe we are not represented as well as we would like are Germany and
the UK,' Mr Rolf Huppi, chief executive, said yesterday.
Mr Huppi said that the group was 'obviously' looking for acquisitions.'
Zurich earlier this year acquired the Australian interests of the UK
composite insurer, Guardian Royal Exchange, but Zurich officials did not
encourage speculation that this deal might lead to something bigger.
Another Zurich official indicated that the group had no interest in
Municipal Mutual, a UK company in difficulty.
Mr Rolf Hanggi, deputy chief executive, said Zurich expected 'a good overall
financial result' this year.

BRISTOL-MYERS Squibb, the US pharmaceuticals company, said there was 'no

On June 2 Bristol-Myers' stock dropped sharply after it said 1992 earnings
