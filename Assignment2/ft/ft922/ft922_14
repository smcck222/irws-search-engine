FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Restrictions on Australia TV
licence bids

DOMESTIC television networks, telecommunications carriers and newspaper
groups will be excluded from the bidding for Australia's first subscription
television licence, the federal Labor government said yesterday.
The announcement reversed earlier indications that the three commercial
television networks and the government-owned Australian Broadcasting
Corporation (ABC) would play a leading role in establishing subscription
television.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said the restrictions would apply to
the licence to operate the first four satellite channels, which are expected
to become available in 1994.
However, Mr Keating said the restrictions would not apply to separate
licences for the fifth and sixth channels, which are expected to start
transmitting a year later.
Mr Keating said foreign investment would be restricted to a total of 35 per
cent in each licence, with a ceiling of 20 per cent on individual
shareholdings.
The announcement ends a lengthy Labor wrangle over the extent to which
participation by the commercial television networks would increase the
concentration of media ownership.
It means that Mr Kerry Packer's Channel Nine television network, which was
considered most likely to invest in subscription television, will be
excluded from the first round of licences.
The decision also excludes the Channel Seven and Channel Ten commercial
networks, the News Corporation and Fairfax newspaper groups, the ABC and the
government-owned Australia and Overseas Telecommunications Corporation.
However, there will be open competition, with no restrictions on ownership,
for the fifth and sixth channels, raising the possibility that Packer could
gain sole control of one channel.
The government had earlier indicated that the commercial networks would be
allowed to hold up to 45 per cent of the equity in the first four channels,
which would have had a monopoly of subscription television until 1999.
Mr Keating said the regulations would lead to a significant reduction in
media concentration by facilitating the entry into satellite television of
new operators such as cinema proprietors, radio stations and programme
makers.
He said the rules would also allow the operators of the fifth and sixth
channels to introduce advanced inter-active technology, which would have
been excluded until 2000 under the earlier proposals.
However, critics said the government would have to change the rules to allow
greater foreign investment in the first four channels if insufficient
Australian investors emerged.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: GM to sell GMFanuc stake

<TEXT>
GENERAL MOTORS is selling its 50 per cent stake in GMFanuc Robotics to
FANUC, the large Japanese robotics company which is its partner in the 10
year-old joint venture.
The deal is the latest example of GM's new strategy of disposing of
peripheral businesses to concentrate on turning around its heavily
loss-making North American automotive operations.
Fanuc said it would be making a cash payment to GM but gave no details.
GMFanuc, which supplies GM and other industrial companies with robotic
systems for painting, welding and other manufacturing techniques, had sales
last year of over Dollars 250m.
It was established in 1982 at a time when FANUC had little manufacturing
presence in the US and when GM was anxious to bring robotics technology to
its plants. FANUC now has several businesses in the US, including a joint
venture with General Electric which produces controllers for machine tools.
GMFanuc's present management will remain in place and the company, which
employs some 670 people, will continue to operate its sales, engineering and
assembly facilities in Auburn Hills, Michigan.
Mr William Hoglund, GM's chief financial officer, said the company intended
to 'maintain our important relationship with GMFanuc as a GM supplier of
plant automation.' The sale is expected to be completed later this year.
In April GM put up for sale its Allison gas turbine division,which employs
6,300 people and makes turbine engines for the aerospace, industrial and
marine markets.

<TEXT>
USAIR, the ailing US airline whose losses have topped Dollars 750m after tax
during the past two years, said it had secured wage concessions worth
Dollars 55m from its pilots over the next 12 months.
The carrier added that when a new four-year contract agreed with the Air
Line Pilots Association is fully implemented, annual savings should total
Dollars 100m.
USAir is among the most financially-fragile carriers in the US, although it
has stayed out of bankruptcy. Last autumn, it announced a plan designed to
cut operating costs by over Dollars 400m. This involved progressive salary
reductions for non-contract employees when at least one of its three big
unions agreed to do the same - a condition fulfilled by the ALPA agreement.
USAir executives agreed to take salary reductions with effect from January
1, regardless of union actions.
The cost-savings, however, come as prospects for the US airline industry
remain bleak, with few analysts expecting it to show a profit this year. The
latest round of domestic fare competition has been intense, with travel
agents reporting computer 'crashes' as travellers scramble to secure cheap
fares before these expire.

<TEXT>
SSAB, the Swedish state-controlled steel company that is being privatised,
reported yesterday a profit of SKr87m for the first quarter of the year,
down from SKr208m for the same period of 1991.
The drop in profitability was blamed by the company on a lower volume of
business. Operating revenues fell to SKr4.35bn from SKr5.08bn for the first
quarter of 1991.
But SSAB added that steel consumption in Sweden appeared to have stabilised
at the level it reached at the end of last year.
The company said that its prices were 6 per cent lower during the first four
months of this year than the average they had been during 1991, but 3 per
cent higher than the average for the past four months.
SSAB's cash-flow amounted to SKr68m, compared with SKr 422m for the first
quarter of last year, while its net liquid assets (after deduction of
short-term financial borrowing) totalled SKr2.26bn, up SKr400m from the
beginning of the year.

FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Canary Wharf administrators reassure
tenants

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF's administr-ators yesterday reassured tenants about their
commitment to the development's upkeep and the river bus service, in the
first of a series of meetings with the project's occupiers.
The administrators told Ogilvy &amp; Mather, the advertising agency, that the
river bus service would continue and the project would be maintained and
kept secure. Nearly all Olympia &amp; York's 218 estate management staff are
continuing to work on the scheme.
Other tenant meetings this week will raise the question of whether rents on
tenants' former premises taken on by Olympia &amp; York, will still be paid by
the administrators.
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm, which handed responsibility for the
leases of 60,000 sq ft of their former premises to Olympia &amp; York, will talk
to the administrators today. Its training centre has moved into one of three
floors, totalling 80,000 sq ft, in the Canary Wharf tower.
Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, yesterday called on the
government to publish the study which found that a move of civil servants to
Docklands represented value for money.
In a letter to Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, Mr Gould said: 'If
it (the study) is as convincing as you claim, I am sure that you will be
happy to release it into the public domain.'
This would be the first test of the government's promise of greater
openness, he said.
Mr Gould also asked Mr Howard to clarify the inducements offered to civil
servants to encourage them to move.
He believed Mr Howard told the House of Commons that the civil servants
would be assisted wherever they lived, and arrangements would be put in
place to minimise the effects of the move. This differed from the report in
Hansard that the department's staff would receive staff relocation
assistance when they moved to Docklands.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Reed lifts profits by 4% to Pounds 232m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REED International, the publishing and information group, warned yesterday
it expected the pace of recovery from recession in its most important
markets to be slower than in previous cyclical upturns.
The warning came from Mr Peter Davis, the Reed chairman, as he announced a 4
per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Pounds 232m for the year to the end
of March. The half-year to September had seen a 22 per cent fall in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 85.3m.
The Reed chairman confessed that a note of optimism expressed with the
interim results had turned out to be premature, though there were now some
signs 'which could turn out to be positive'.
Reed's operating profit rose 9 per cent to Pounds 271m, earnings per share
were 4 per cent higher at 29.3p, and operating cash-flow was up 32 per cent
at Pounds 293m - 108 per cent of operating profit.
Reed said its dividend for the year would increase by 7 per cent to 16p.
Reed's share price rose 6p to 580p on the London Stock Exchange in response
to the news.
Mr Davis said the results achieved during the recession were 'further
evidence of the benefits of the strategy to concentrate on publishing and
information businesses'. In spite of advertising-based businesses being
severely hit, the profit margin on sales was 16.6 per cent.
Five years ago Reed took a strategic decision to get out of manufacturing
businesses such as paint, pulp and packaging and concentrate on publishing.
The results of that decision are being assessed as part of a review of
strategy.
Further consolidation is likely, although acquisitions will probably
outweigh disposals. One acquisition, if it became available and if the
financial terms were right, might be the Official Airline Guides, bought by
the late Mr Robert Maxwell.
Among the main Reed businesses, consumer publishing suffered a 22.9 per cent
drop in operating profit to Pounds 52.4m, business-to-business publishing
saw a modest improvement of 9.6 per cent to Pounds 36.4m, exhibitions rose
26 per cent to Pounds 30.5m, and reference publishing soared 64 per cent to
Pounds 31.8m.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Company reps give green light to grey cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAT BANE of Britain's motorways, the company rep in his macho red car,
tailgating at 90mph, might be starting to fade into history.
According to a survey by PHH Allstar, one of the UK's biggest car fleet
management groups, bright aggressive car colours are starting to be replaced
by more subdued tones.
This year, grey company cars have become six times more popular than in the
same period of 1991.
This would 'seem to confirm that Britain is becoming the more caring and
hard-working place that prime minister John Major has said he wants to see',
according to PHH Allstar.
To the ranks of the greys must be added the greens.
The number of orders for green cars has more than doubled from last year,
according to the survey.
The information came from an analysis of 5,000 cars which PHH has bought for
its clients since January 1.
Blue cars have overtaken white for second place in the popularity stakes,
although red remains marginally the favourite colour.
The trend could lead to less stressed motoring in future because there are
observable links between the colours chosen for cars and driver behaviour,
says PHH Allstar.
The company recruited psychologist Dr David Lewis to carry out a study of
the subject last year.
Accident frequency rates and their possible causes have become a particular
focus of concern for the fleet management business. This has been as a
result of soaring insurance premiums and a restructuring of the premium
system by the Association of British Insurers during the past 12 months.
So what does that mean in terms of driver attitudes? According to Dr Lewis,
grey cars are indicative of a careful nature, 'a strong sense of duty and a
belief that everybody should lead as sober and upright a life as him or
herself.'
Green cars are said to denote caution and a tendency to put family life
before success at work.
The survey could be seen as waving a red rag to blues, in concluding that
they are likely to be 'hard-working but slightly lacklustre'.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Maxwell brothers seek Dollars 10m for media venture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY, JIMMY BURNS and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN MAXWELL and his brother Ian are trying to raise Dollars 10m to
launch an international media investment partnership.
The aim of the venture is to take stakes in promising media businesses in
the UK, the US and in a number of countries in central and eastern Europe.
In a strategy reminiscent of their late father, Mr Robert Maxwell, the
brothers apparently believe that the recession in the UK and the US and the
political changes in eastern Europe provide investment opportunities.
The areas seen as potential investment include electronic publishing,
academic and professional journals, free newspapers and directories.
Following the circulation of a letter from Mr Kevin Maxwell seeking
investment funds, it is believed that a draft prospectus for the new
partnership has been produced.
It seeks to raise the funds by the end of the month.
The brothers have been working from offices at 2 Wardrobe Place, London,
rented in the name of Sphere Inc, a Californian video games company.
Mr Robert Maxwell took an 80 per cent stake in the company in 1987. The
holding is controlled by the Maxwell Charitable Trust in Liechtenstein,
which is outside the present reach of administrators, creditors and
pensioners.
Yesterday, after the Financial Times identified the location of the offices,
it appeared that they had been, at least temporarily, abandoned.
Photographers waited outside and there was no sign of life.
It is believed that, as well as the Maxwell brothers and their secretaries,
it was planned that Mr Michael Stoney would also work from the offices.
Mr Stoney is former deputy managing director (finance) of Mirror Group
Newspapers and deputy managing director of AGB International, the market
research group once owned by Maxwell private interests.
Earlier this year, along with Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell, Mr Stoney
declined to answer questions from the House of Commons select committee on
pensions which concerned more than Pounds 400m missing from the pension
funds of Maxwell-controlled companies.
However, Mr Stoney's own pension is intact. It is in the executive pension
plan of AGB International, a small fund for about 20 people that was not
raided during the final months of Mr Robert Maxwell's life.
The fund, unlike a number of other Maxwell pension funds, will not be wound
up because it has been judged by its trustees Clay &amp; Partners to be still
viable.
The planned new Maxwell investment fund would take minority stakes in a
range of existing media enterprises. The Maxwell brothers would be involved
in the management of the investments in return for a fee.
Meanwhile the Serious Fraud Office said it would investigate the
Liechtenstein-based companies linked with the Maxwell family.
The SFO said that although, six months after Mr Robert Maxwell's death, no
one from the organisation had yet approached the Liechtenstein authorities,
inquiries into the companies were 'inevitable'.
There was no reason to believe the SFO would receive anything other than
co-operation from them, the SFO said.

However unlucky it may be to re-name a ship, the Royal Navy must be
considering doing just that to one of its Oberon-class submarines.
With the world's top admirals assembled to watch the RN's Sea Days exercises
 -a showpiece for the efficiency of British naval equipment - the vessel
collided with a container ship while surfacing in the fog-bound Channel.
Although neither was badly damaged, and there were no casualties, the
submarine apparently came off worst.
Its name? HMS Opportune.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Observer: Travelling strife
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A cause of many strained if not broken romances may soon be explained,
thanks to experiments at the US University of Rochester. The trouble arises
on unfamiliar car journeys when either a woman or a man is driving to
instructions given by the other, and misses the specified turning.
'I said fork right, not left,' explodes the male - or 'I said go to the town
hall and turn along the front of it, not up by the art gallery,' protests
the female - each concluding that the other is an idiot.
Not so, suggests Rochester researcher Thomas Bever. It seems likely that the
two sexes have essentially different navigating systems.
His tests over four years with students as well as rats indicate that males
typically find their way by 'mapping out' space in their heads, thinking of
journeys as consisting of so much distance in one direction, then so much
more in another, and so on. By contrast, females tend to navigate by visible
landmarks.
Either way, the two sexes seem equally good at getting to the right
destination, says Bever. It's just that, in this as so much else, they are
incompatible.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Observer: Cleaning out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If Kevin Maxwell really wanted a cheap bolt-hole, surely he could have done
better than hide in what old City hands know as 'The Wardrobe'. After all,
Wardrobe Place in the shadow of St Paul's Cathedral is not only a mere
quarter mile away from where the missing millions were last seen, but an
obvious resting place for fringe operators.
Until the current property bust, it was about the only bit of the City left
that was convenient, cheap and undeveloped. In the past it has been the home
of slick PR operators like John Addey, and fringe financial operators such
as LHW Futures which achieved notoriety in the mid-1980s for its hard-sell
tactics and unusually high commission charges.
If Maxwell should move out then 'The Wardrobe' will be virtually empty.
However, this is unlikely to cause much heartache in the boardroom of
Warnford Investments which owns most of the surrounding property, although
not Number 2 itself.
Headed by 81-year-old George Ross Goobey, one of the City's wisest old
birds, Warnford is an unusual property company. It slept whilst its rivals
developed, with the result that it has been able to increase its profits and
its dividends last year.

A black day it was for Lloyd's of London chairman David Coleridge, and not
simply because of new forecasts putting the insurance market's losses for
1989 at Pounds 2bn, a fifth higher than previous estimates. He's also
chairman of Sturge Holdings, Lloyd's biggest agency.
The news from Sturge was that it expected to cut its annual dividend by
half, so trimming Coleridge's income from his 6.8m share stake by Pounds
559,324. But that's not all. Following a savage reaction from the market,
which pegged the shares down 59p to 111p, the value of Coleridge's stake has
plunged from Pounds 11.56m to Pounds 7.55m.

Perhaps the Archbishop of Canterbury should take a preaching trip to the US.
A new survey shows that the average cash pay of the 10 best rewarded
American bank executives jumped by 46 per cent in 1991, when the
corresponding rise in their banks' earnings was less than 7 per cent.
The study, by Virginia research company SNL Securities, brought a swift
homily from Professor Graef Crystal, the pay expert and scourge of corporate
America well known for highlighting the enormous rewards of Time Warner's
Steve Ross. If pay was really related to performance in the banks, Crystal
said, 'then we wouldn't be seeing salaries like this during a recession.'
More likely than some to have merited his rise was JP Morgan chairman Sir
Dennis Weatherstone, whose 30.1 per cent rise took him to the top of the US
bank chiefs' league with total pay of Dollars 2.06m. Two others who had more
than Dollars 2m were Chemical Banking's chairman John McGillicuddy, and Hugh
McColl, who heads NationsBank, which ensued from the merger of NCNB and C &amp;
S/Sovran.
Alas for Citicorp's John Reed, he didn't even make the top 10. He slipped to
22nd in the 1991 league with a rise of 1.5 per cent to a mere Dollars 1.22m.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Letter: Different view of relationship between CAP reform
and Gatt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Messrs DALE E HATHAWAY and FRED H SANDERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your editorial 'Time for a Gatt deal' (May 26) and several of your
preceding stories have misled readers in terms of the relationship between
Common Agricultural Policy reform and the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
First, the CAP reform does not reduce subsidies to EC farmers; it changes
the form in which the income transfers occur. Its major impact should be to
increase domestic consumption of cereals and livestock products and reduce
the need for ever increasing subsidised exports.
Second, the reformed CAP is not distinctly better than US policies regarding
distortion of production. The US programmes froze yields used to calculate
deficiency payments in 1985. In the 1990 Farm Bill and Budget Act, payments
are limited to 85 per cent of acreage covered by the programme. Moreover, US
producers can get payments without producing any of the crops in question
(0-92 provision). Thus, the US programme results in a significant output of
programme crops which receives no payments.
Finally, the CAP reform was a necessary and significant change in EC policy
for internal reasons which moved in the direction the US began in the 1960s.
Why should it exempt the EC from agreeing to international rules on
reductions any more than US reforms exempt the US from such rules?
The CAP reform should make it easier (not harder) for the EC to accept the
limits on export subsidies and internal support suggested by the Dunkel
proposal.
(Reductions in producer support since 1986-88, together with the set-aside,
should enable the community to meet the proposed 20 per cent cut in internal
support with only modest changes even if compensation for future price cuts
is included.)
To suggest that the EC subsidies should be exempt from cuts is to miss the
point of the entire Gatt negotiation which is about reducing support and
protection.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Mutiny rocks EC ship of state: Denmark's rejection of the
Maastricht Treaty poses a grave threat to hopes for European integration
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ratify or be damned. This was how Denmark's EC partners, and the European
Commission, yesterday reacted to the thumbs down given by the Danish
electorate on Tuesday to the Maastricht Treaty on political and monetary
union. Since they will not now ratify the treaty, Danes can expect
damnation, or at least to be cast into Community limbo.
Some EC leaders were more diplomatic than others. Mr Jacques Delors, the
Commission president, warned of 'consequences not only for the Community,
but for Denmark and Danes'. Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, the Portuguese foreign
minister who has the unenviable task of being in the EC presidency chair at
this crisis moment, was very blunt.
'We can't have a member state which does not accept the fundamental goals of
the Community (as contained in Maastricht) continuing to be a member state,'
he said. 'It could have another status, another relationship with the EC.'
President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said they regretted
the Danish decision, but pledged 'their determination to realise the
European union unswervingly'. Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary,
said the Danish vote was 'not a reason to stop others going ahead'.
Do Denmark's partners mean business or just bluster? That will become
clearer later today when EC foreign ministers hold an emergency meeting
while they attend a Nato gathering in Oslo. But it is clear that the small
number of Danish voters - some 46,000 - who tipped the referendum against
Maastricht have precipitated the worst Community crisis since 1965. It was
then that General Charles De Gaulle took France out of the Council of
Ministers, insisting that his partners could not make decisions in his
absence. They refused, stiffened by Dutch resistance, and six months later
France came back into the Council.
There is a parallel to today's crisis. 'If Denmark's 11 partners stick
together on Maastricht, this will not be a big crisis,' said a senior EC
official yesterday. 'But if they start to have second thoughts, then this
will indeed be a big crisis.' It is not a question of facing down a Danish
government, which is wholly mortified by what its voters have done. Even if
it were, small Denmark faces 11, mostly larger, partners; big France
dominated the original six.
It is the dark doubts that so many countries have, or have had, about
aspects of the great integrationist leap of Maastricht that are the
difference between now and the 1965-66 crisis. Darkest of these doubts is
whether governments are not simply way ahead of their populaces in their
acceptance or enthusiasm for tighter European integration. The only test of
that would be to put Maastricht to a EC-wide plebiscite, which no-one is
proposing. But Mr Mitterrand yesterday grasped part of the nettle by
announcing a French referendum on Maastricht; his gamble, high-risk for his
own political domestic fortunes, is for a resounding French Yes to quash the
impact of the marginal Danish No.
The initial, flat refusal yesterday of Denmark's partners to renegotiate
Maastricht reflects their fear that the treaty was like a boat, carried
safely to harbour by a high-tide of Europeanism that may now be ebbing away.
Renegotiation could well sink it, in new cross-currents of fears about
central control from Brussels; about immigrants flooding across newly-opened
borders within the EC; about Maastricht's new powers for the European
Parliament robbing national parliaments of their legislative birthrights.
Any renegotiation of Maastricht would also invite a double broadside against
its key provisions for economic and monetary union (Emu) and common foreign
and eventually defence policies. Bonn would almost certainly not be able to
renegotiate Emu, unless it secured the clear-cut opt-out that Britain and
Denmark won; and if Germany were allowed a 'maybe' commitment to Emu, all
momentum would be lost. The Maastricht commitment to a European foreign
policy and defence would also be eroded by the Atlanticists - the UK,
Portugal and the Netherlands - and by neutral Ireland and by Denmark, many
of whose citizens showed this week that they want to keep the Community in
civvies, not in military uniform.
But before Maastricht's opponents drain their champagne glasses, they should
spare a thought about what might happen if the treaty dies. Its death will
not necessarily mean the death of Emu or of European defence, Indeed, both
could occur on terms vastly less pleasing to most EC states. As Mr Karl Otto
Pohl used to say, only half-jokingly, when he was Bundesbank president,
Germany is ready right now for Emu with some of its immediate neighbours -
France, the Benelux (and he used to mention Denmark).
But there would not be any democratic European structure to such a monetary
union, outside the Community. Breathing a sigh of relief at not having to
take in spendthrift southerners, or Britons, Germany could pick and choose
its partners for a northern continental currency club. Emu on these terms
might be very attractive to many of those Germans who currently rail against
Maastricht. And the loud howls from excluded Italy would not make it any
less so.
Likewise, the death of Maastricht might not make President Mitterrand and
Chancellor Kohl any less keen to pursue their plan to create a European army
corps by 1995. It might render them keener. At present, they only have a
rather implausible joint brigade of 4,000 men. But in the absence of
partners, they might try to put substantially more of their armies together.
More important, Maastricht enshrined the Western European Union, the
nine-nation defence organisation with established links to Nato, as the body
through which Europe would develop its defence interests. Any European force
would come under a WEU umbrella. That umbrella could be blown away along
with Maastricht, making the Americans even more irritated about
Franco-German rivalry to Nato than they already are.
These, then, are some of the stakes involved in the current Maastricht mess.
There are, basically, two ways of sorting it out. The first is for the 11 to
stick to the line that most of them espoused yesterday. This involves them
all plodding on with ratification, as if Tuesday's Danish rejection had
never happened. Then, at the end of the year, they would tell Denmark to
find some way of approving Maastricht, or take itself out of the Community
at least out of the European Union created by Maastricht.
The second option would involve listening carefully to what the Danish
government suggests might mollify its voters, and trying to do something
about it. A compromise might exploit the fact that the European Union
contains three 'pillars', in the Maastricht jargon - one covering standard
EC business (enlarged to Emu), and two 'inter-governmental' pillars covering
foreign, defence, police, immigration and home affairs. It was not ruled out
in Brussels yesterday that Denmark could stay in the EC, but forego
participation in the new inter-governmental business. Myriad problems leap
to mind; for instance, what about sanctions on Serbia which are decided
inter-governmentally by all 12, but implemented by EC machinery? 'But,
legally, we can always arrange something,' said an EC expert.
The snag about letting countries dine a la carte off the European menu - as
the complaints that followed Britain's Maastricht opt-out clause on social
policy highlighted - is that it opens the way to ever-greater fragmentation
of Community activity. In particular, if Denmark can pick and choose, why
cannot the new members queueing to join the EC?
Ironically, it was enlargement, or rather its implications for EC
integration and institutions, that may have just tipped the Danish vote
against the treaty. At President Mitterrand's suggestion, last December's
Maastricht summit decided to ask the Commission to prepare a report for this
month's Lisbon summit on how the Community could cope with a more numerous
membership.
The Commission has taken the study seriously: perhaps, it belatedly
realised, too seriously. Certain ideas for the report, which is still not
finalised, started to leak out a month ago. These included reducing the
required minimum votes for taking decisions by majority and transforming the
Commission into a more powerful executive, particularly on the foreign
policy side.
Alarmed at seeing all his work on Maastricht, particularly on Emu, slip
away, the Commission president back-pedalled by rightly denying these ideas
had any official status. But this was not before newspaper headlines such as
'Delors wants to rule Europe' had had their impact in Denmark.
It is equally ironic that Danes were yesterday being sharply criticised by
some of their fellow Nordics.
The one certain consequence of the Maastricht mess is that, unless it is
very speedily sorted out, it will prevent accession negotiations with
Sweden, Austria, Finland and Switzerland starting, as the forthcoming UK
presidency planned, next January. Thus, Denmark may bring down on its heads
the wrath of its fellow Nordics in Sweden and Finland, while perhaps
indefinitely deferring an EC entry application from Norway.
Another item on the Community's agenda - that of its future financing over
the next five years - now becomes even more pressing. Spain has warned that
it will not ratify Maastricht until it get satisfaction on more 'cohesion'
cash, via the EC budget, from northern countries. But the latter may now
reply: 'What's the point in paying the bill for Maastricht, with Maastricht
itself in such doubt?' On such issues, the united front which Denmark's EC
partners sought yesterday to present could well come apart.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CAUTION and pragmatism, not wholesale restructuring according to some
pre-ordained blueprint, are to be the guiding lights for the Local
Government Commission, soon to set about its business of reviewing the
structure of local councils in England. Despite statements made by Mr
Michael Heseltine last year, Mr Michael Howard, the new environment
secretary, said yesterday that the commission is to harbour no prior
assumptions as to the superiority of unitary authorities. Instead,
efficiency, coupled with local sentiment and tradition, are to be the
criteria for reform, and Sir John Banham and his colleagues are to be given
several years to complete their work.
Operating table
This is to be welcomed. Britain's local government has spent most of the
last 20 years on Whitehall's operating table. Convalescing as it is from the
poll tax, it remains in intensive care with further council tax traumas in
the offing. Root and branch restructuring is the last thing it needs. Where
manifest anomalies are identified, let them be tackled. Some of the larger
cities currently stifled within county councils might well benefit from
restoration of county borough status. But if it works, and the local
community is other than strongly dissatisfied, don't try to fix it.
Nonetheless, local government's structure cannot be divorced from its
functions - and central government may be about to make such an approach
impossible by significantly reducing those functions.
Steady increase
All depends on the education white paper due next month, which is to set out
the future organisation of state schools assuming a steady increase in the
number opting out of local education authority control. Even without direct
control of schools, local education authorities could retain important
functions relating to monitoring and the planning of local provision. But
there is a strong Tory lobby which wants to withdraw even those functions
from local government. Since county councils are primarily education
authorities, most of their raison d'etre would disappear if ministers opt
for the radical course. The case then for a single-tier structure would be
well-nigh unanswerable.
The future of the education service will thus have more bearing on the
future shape of town halls than will anything else. This only strengthens
the case for the commission to proceed with caution.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Arts: La Fille mal gardee - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For two centuries, La Fille mal gardee has been one of the happiest and best
loved of balletic comedies. It was born in Bordeaux on July 1, 1789, on the
eve of the French Revolution. Its choreographer, Dauberval, was a man of
rare dramatic abilities who produced ballets in which, he said, 'I do not
just want to please the eyes. I must interest the heart'.
His enchanting pastoral narrative - worthy of Moliere - proved irresistible,
and has interested hearts ever since. Fille was re-staged throughout Europe
in the 19th century, revised, altered in step and score, given in theatres
grand and modest, and then, for British audiences, gained its ultimate and
most adorable form in Ashton's 1960 masterpiece for the Royal Ballet.
But what of Dauberval's original? We can hazard guesses at late-18th century
technique and staging, but nothing remains (save a fragment of choreography
by Galeotti in Copenhagen) of the dance or the dance manner that would be
finally swept away by the wave of Romanticism.
Scholarly reconstruction seeks to turn guesses into some sort of theatrical
reality, and if we view such archeology with the eye of faith and a generous
spirit, then the result can be something like. Neither true nor completely
(we hope) untrue, the restoration opens a window on to the past.
Just so the version of Fille that the Ballet du Rhin has brought to London
on the occasion of its first visit.
The company, based in Mulhouse, is directed by Jean-Paul Gravier who, when
heading the Ballet de Nantes, invited Ivo Cramer to make a reconstruction of
Dauberval's original Fille. Cramer is a distinguished Swedish choreographer
and scholar, expert in pre-Romantic dance style. The presence of a Dauberval
manuscript in Stockholm (where Fille was first seen in 1812) with details of
the staging, and Ivor Guest's happy discovery of the original
Bordeaux score, provided valuable references for Cramer's production. The
result was charming, persuasive, and when Gravier moved to the Ballet du
Rhin two years ago, he brought with him this touching piece of balletic
history.
And how like - and how unlike - it is to the Fille we know with the Royal
ballet] The action is exactly similar, with the addition of a final
harvest-field divertissement, and there are even fragments of the score
which correspond with the Herold version we know today. Cramer's score has
been expertly edited and orchestrated by Charles Farncombe, and probably
given a good deal more musical dignity than it first knew. How much is owed
to Ivor Guest's discovery we are not told - the programme book could, with
advantage, have been more informative - but what we hear is pretty, often
elegant, and Herold's borrowings for his version give us a touching link
with the ballet's beginnings.
What we see is a dance drama performed with a nice simplicity of manner, in
a dance style that stresses quick, light footwork, decorous positions
(though a couple of Cramer's lifts seem to me anachronistic), and a
freshness and vivacity of manner that wins the heart. Incidents are
short-breathed, but choreographic patterns - owing something to social dance
forms - are felicitous.
The Ballet du Rhin artists are charmers all, with Sandrine Moreau very
pretty as Lison - she looks exactly like one of Friedric Schall's portraits
of dancers of this period, found in the Ephrussi-de Rothschild Museum at Cap
Ferrat - James Amar an elegant Colas, and Jean-Paul Gravier an energetic
Ragotte, which is Mother Simone's new name.
The ballet has been enchantingly dressed by the film-maker Dominique
Delouche, and given suitably straight-forward decoration by him, complete
with chandeliers on stage to remind us of the correct stage lighting.
The score sounded beguiling, with the Wren orchestra under Stephen Lade. The
evening is gentle, and a delight.
The Ballet du Rhin presents La Fille mal gardee at Sadler's Wells on June 4,
5, 6, 12, 13; a triple bill of modern work can be seen on June 9,10. The
visit is sponsored by the Association Francaise d'Action Artistique and the
Opera du Rhin.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Arts: A maze of a movie - Cinema
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PLAYBOYS (12) Odeon Haymarket
THE LAWNMOWER MAN (15) Odeon Leicester Sq
RUSH (18) Empire
THE FIVE HEARTBEATS (15) Prince Charles
The Playboys resembles one of those pocket games where you steer a small
silver ball, or several, into the heart of a maze. The silver balls here are
stars Albert Finney, Aidan Quinn and Robin Wright, playing a pretty, unwed
mother and her two suitors in 1950s rural Ireland, and the maze is the
film's plot.
Co-written by Kerry Crabbe and Shane (My Left Foot) Connaughton, this
contains enough blind alleys and colourful digressions to render the unwary
intruder stark staring mad. It would also seem to require a director with
more sense of direction than Gillies Mackinnon. The Scottish-born film
school graduate is known for works like Conquest of the South Pole and
Needle where narrative cogency is a willing casualty of stylistic or
structural experiment.
Here we have a story. And the story includes unmarried motherhood,
haymaking, suicide by shotgun (Adrian Dunbar as an early adorer of Miss
Wright), a band of strolling players (the eponymous Playboys led by Milo
O'Shea), a policeman gnawed by amorous jealousy (Mr Finney), a lovable
troubadour (Mr Quinn, attached to the said Playboys), smugglers, the IRA,
the arrival of television, and Gone With The Wind showing at the local
cinema. How do you steer your silver balls into that labyrinth?
In the event, the film proves perversely enjoyable: being lost in a maze
often is. The happiest conceit was to use the theatre troupe's quick-change
repertory of plays - Othello one night, something occult the next, Gone With
The Wind with songs a third - as a comical distorting mirror to the village
intrigues. Finney's police sergeant, part volcano, part buffoon, is Othello
with a side order of Les Dawson; while Quinn's roguish charm becomes Rhett
Butler with a County Cavan accent.
The longer the film lasts, the more accustomed we become to its
multi-diversionary style. And the more we sense a harmony in the motifs,
which all hint at an old world changing to a new: from the birth of
television to the sexual politics of single motherhood. Most unifying force
of all is Miss Wright as the swept-several-ways heroine. International
pre-sales probably demanded that an American actress play an Irish heroine.
But this actress (late of The Princess Bride and State Of Grace) does so
with flawless accent and also suggests Hardyesque depths and strengths to a
girl lost in a maelstrom of love, not to mention a maze of a movie.
The Lawnmower Man has been hailed as the first Virtual Reality film. VR is
the state-of-art system whereby, donning a computerised helmet and glove and
sitting in a movement-simulator seat, we can see, hear and even feel
imaginary worlds.
Why, given this Promethean gadgetry, we should want to see, hear or feel any
of the things featured in this sci-fi thriller directed by Brett Leonard is
another matter. The film is not 'in' Virtual Reality of course - can you
imagine an Odeon Leicester Square full of helmets, gloves and twitching
seats? - but about it. Dr Pierce Brosnan, a scientist at Cybertech, performs
VR experiments on a retarded gardener (Jeff Fahey) which go horribly wrong.
Though transformed from simpleton to superman in about two weeks, Mr Fahey
is soon 'mowing' people's brains with his telekinetic powers. And when he
makes electronic love to a girl via Virtual Reality, the results are
disastrous.
Using computer images about as inspired as Disney's ten-year-old Tron, the
film is an essay in Virtual Fatuity sometimes raised to Achieved Banality.
The 'real' characters are even less lifelike than their electronic
projections. And the progressively inchoate script, based on a Stephen King
story crossed with a project of the director's own called CyberGod, was
probably written in a screenwriting-simulation seat. In this the writer is
swayed about by a whole lot of seeming inspirations only to discover on
waking that all that remains in his head is colourful gibberish.
Rush is one of those Hollywood thrillers whose plot the critic can intuit in
advance by scanning the list of minor characters in his cast list: 'Yellow
Rose Waitress', 'Wino', 'Scooter Trash', 'Man In Hearse', 'Medical
Examiner.' Ah: must be about petty violence and alcoholic abuse in Texas
escalating into death or murder.
Amazing, Holmes. Yes, Watson, but years of schooling in the Virtual Insanity
that is cinema teach one, first, that Hollywood does everything by numbers
and, secondly, that it cannot add up. So this tale of two narcotics
policepersons (Jason Patric and Jennifer Jason Leigh) who risk addiction by
using drugs themselves - to impress the dealers they wish to entrap - moves
powerfully through early and middle scenes only to collapse near the end.
The climax has our hero and heroine 'hiding' from the villains, after
blowing the whistle on them, by spending the night in a lonely, exposed
caravan park about a mile from the nearest telephone. Dear me. Are you
surprised when Miss Leigh wakes up to find the Chief Baddie's shotgun in her
mouth?
Cue screams, blood pellets and homilies over the receding stretcher. Before
this, erstwhile producer Lili Fini Zanuck (Driving Miss Daisy) makes a fair
fist of her directing debut. She pummels tension into some over-wordy scenes
 -screenplay by Pete Dexter from the bestselling book by narcotics cop and
ex-addict Kim Wozencraft - and she coaxes a beautiful performance from Miss
Leigh.
This pudgy-pretty actress, recently memorable as the live-in lover of a
psychopath (Miami Vice), deftly suggests the quiet birthpangs of panic.
Watch her face in one scene as masquerade changes to reality and she watches
her partner forced to inject real heroin.
Robert Townsend's The Five Heartbeats is an early harbinger of the summer
silly season. Subject: the rise and disintegration of a black rock group.
Time: 1960s. Intellectual level: the same as that of last week's The Mambo
Kings.
But where that had style and Armand Assante, this has schmaltz and five
black actors going OTT. The perky wit that marked Townsend's first feature
Hollywood Shuffle is replaced by a game of Guess The Next Cliche.
Will it be the lead vocalist who falls horribly apart on drugs? Or the nice
manager who is knifed in the back by the nasty one? Or the final reunion in
which the band forgets its differences and sings its heart out, oblivious to
the scuffle in the cinema auditorium as spectators compete to be first
through the exit door.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Technology: A licence to print money - Clive Cookson finds
out why selling research can be as profitable as exploiting the inventions
in-house
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Researchers working for Thorn EMI, the UK entertainment and electronics
group, have made a breakthrough in one of the most competitive areas of R&amp;D:
liquid crystal displays (LCDs) for flat-screen televisions and portable
computers.
That is a notable technical achievement in a field dominated by Japanese
companies (which between them spend an estimated Pounds 1bn a year on LCD
development).
But it is more remarkable still that a company which makes neither TVs nor
computer displays - and has no intention of doing so in future - should have
invested several million pounds over the last few years in LCD research.
Thorn has just signed the first licensing agreement with a Japanese
electronics manufacturer to commercialise its new type of ferroelectric LCD,
and the UK company hopes that royalties from that and other licensing deals
will repay its research investment.
The LCD programme is one example of the way Thorn has managed to maintain
the scientific and technical strength of its Central Research Laboratories
(CRL) in Hayes, west of London, while the company has transformed itself
from being primarily a high-technology electronics manufacturer 10 years ago
to primarily an entertainment and leisure company today.
Ken Gray, technical director, joined Thorn in 1984 from the government's
Royal Signals and Radar Establishment. The period since then has been 'one
of the most remarkable periods of radical change imaginable for any
company,' he says.
Colin Southgate, chief executive, has disposed of many of the
technology-based manufacturing businesses, including Ferguson televisions in
1987, and he says any of the remaining businesses apart from music and
rental - now the two core areas - might be sold too if Thorn received a
suitable offer.
Such a transformation could have destroyed CRL which, as a vivid historical
exhibition reminds visitors to the laboratories, was responsible for many
pioneering developments in electronics: the first stereo sound recording,
first 405-line television, first airborne radar, first solid-state colour
TV, and the NMR brain scanner which won a Nobel prize for Thorn researcher
Godfrey Hounsfield.
The laboratory has certainly had to make many adjustments and give up some
lines of research. But the overall policy has been to maintain CRL at an
approximately constant size - with 230 staff including 165 scientists and
engineers - and to continue promising research programmes even if Thorn
sells the business that was originally intended to exploit their results.
The active licensing out policy started because the parent group kept
selling businesses. But the company has recently extended it, so CRL now
sets out to develop some technology for licensing from the start.
Thorn began to run CRL as a separate company with its own profit and loss
accounts this year. 'It's demonstrating that R&amp;D can be looked upon as an
activity like any other in a commercial organisation,' Gray says.
CRL is budgeting for an income of Pounds 11.5m in 1992-93. Only 48 per cent
of this comes directly from Thorn businesses; 21 per cent comes from
external grants or contracts and 31 per cent from royalties paid by other
companies exploiting CRL research under licence. The broad areas of
technology covered are electronics, computing, optics and new materials.
'We do a lot of radical research, which means taking a big step into a new
area,' Gray says. This commitment to radical - and therefore inevitably
speculative - research distinguishes CRL from other contract research
organisations.
Another feature of CRL's work is its avoidance of specific product
development. Instead, it concentrates on 'ideas, technologies and
applications, based on wide-ranging scientific knowledge coupled to market
awareness'. Examples of current CRL projects include:
Neural networks. Thorn is working on several applications in this
fashionable area of research, using computers to find patterns or classify
data in a way that resembles a simple model of the brain (see story on
right).
One is in the financial area: CRL has developed a network that a bank could
use to spot likely bad debts among loan applications. Another, which might
be used by Thorn's own rental business, identifies customers who are most
likely to terminate their contracts - and might be worthwhile targets for a
direct mail shot to persuade them to stay on. The music business is
interested in using a neural network to model styles of composition and
generate background 'musak'.
Visualisation. CRL has developed a system which gives an accurate impression
on a computer screen of complex lighting schemes. An architect or lighting
engineer can use it to demonstrate the effects of different light fittings.
Fingerprint classification. An entirely new system of encoding fingerprints
 -based on the interference patterns created when two copies of the same
print are superimposed and moved relative to each other - will be evaluated
this summer in a mass trial among Thorn workers. The intensity of the
interference patterns generates a 48-number code identifying that
individual. Applications include access control and identification.
However, despite the success of CRL's strategy so far, it remains to be seen
whether it can continue in the long run, particularly if Thorn sheds its
remaining businesses in electronics, security and lighting and becomes
exclusively a music and rental company. And there is always the question of
what happens if CRL comes up with a truly radical development - a
world-beating invention that Thorn would want to exploit itself, if only it
had kept its high-technology manufacturing operations.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Management: A Texan's radical cheek - The slick style with
which H Ross Perot is packaging his bid for the White House is making other
candidates rethink strategies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Until H Ross Perot rode in from Texas, short in the saddle but long in the
pocket, it did not appear that the packaging of presidential candidates this
year would differ much from recent elections. The flag and the family (for
President Bush), the pain and the hope of change (for Governor Bill Clinton)
would be the predictable leitmotifs in the mainstream media, leavened, or
sullied, by the usual dose of negative political advertising.
Now, win, lose or draw, Perot may be in the process of changing that
calculation. His wealth may be no more than an equalising factor, though one
not enjoyed by previous independent candidates. But it is his unconventional
approach to the media in its twin role as a conveyor of information and
image which threatens to stand accepted wisdom as much on its head as did
the Nixon campaign of 1968, so expertly chronicled in Joe McGinnis's book,
Selling of the President.
The Perot approach runs on two tracks. The first is to treat the
establishment media as precisely that - part of that same establishment
which he says is running the country into the sand. Symptomatic of this was
that he chose to announce his interest in the presidency on a television
talk show, and has spent most of his time since on what might be described
as 'celebrity' programmes which tend to be stronger on style than substance.
This genre, he has said, is what 'the people' now tune in to.
The second stems from his understanding that this is now an electronically
wired country, no longer so reliant for communication and information on
conventional newspapers, TV and radio. His is a world of massive phone
banks, electronic 'town meetings' and tele-conferences, where different and
distant parts of the country can be hooked into one network to receive the
message and, as in the ubiquitous talk shows, vent the complaints.
Typical was last Friday's political 'event', which featured a live address
by Perot - and subsequent 'two-way audio interaction' - from Orlando,
Florida, to audiences in the capitals of five other far flung states - Ohio,
Alabama, Kansas, Wyoming, and Idaho. The most that even a mobile
conventional candidate might manage in the space of a single day would be
airport rallies, and local 'soundbite' news coverage, from three of the six
places at best; and the cost of the chartered jet alone might well exceed
that of Perot's electronic network.
There is a word for this bypassing of the accepted means of political
communication; it is telepopulism, a variant on a political tradition as old
as the country itself. In his way, Ronald Reagan was a telepopulist
president, preferring to use his office as a 'bully pulpit' to go over the
heads of the body politic. But his was of a less electronic kind, beyond the
use of the Autocue. His principal approach was to charm the pants off the
established media, in order to get his message over.
Perot has leaped beyond this by ignoring both. He allows the traditional
political media to ask its traditional political questions.
But he considers himself under no obligation to reply as others might
because he has established, as he would have it, his own independent means
of communication. 'I'm not sure,' he has said, 'how much people read any
more. What happens on TV is what really impacts on people.' And TV, with the
proliferation of cable, is not what it was in the age of domination by the
three commercial networks.
He is also, by trade, a master salesman who understands that products and
people need the right image, for which he is prepared to pay. Though he says
he is not going to hang around 'having my nose powdered,' his press
secretary says media buyers and other expertise will be contracted for in
due course.
For the moment, he recommends that those who want to know more about him
read Wings of Eagles by Ken Follett, the 'fictional' account of the rescue
of two of his employees from a Tehran jail in 1979 which casts Perot in
heroic mould. But it has emerged that he had editorial control over the
book. It will be interesting to see if a new 'biography' of Perot, promised
by Random House for July publication, carries similar conditions.
The problem for Bush and Clinton is whether to fight fire with fire, or, if
not, how to deflate the Perot bubble. Clinton has begun to experiment with
electronic hook-ups which play to his policy-oriented strengths and had
previously exposed himself to some of the television programmes which Perot
has subsequently adopted, though mostly to rebut charges about his marriage
and sex life. Bush still insists that 'I won't go on Phil Donahue' - the
daytime programme for housewives.
Instead, the president has reached into Madison Avenue with the conventional
recruitment of Martin Puris, of Ammirati &amp; Puris, and Clayton Wilhite, of
D'Arcy, Masius, Benton and Bowles, to devise new and less stodgy advertising
and media strategies. But Americans these days do not 'feel good' as they
did in the 1980s. This leaves the most likely recourse for Bush and Clinton
to take the route of 'attack advertising' against Perot - and for him, if
his pugnacity and patent dislike of Bush is any guide - to respond in kind.
The early primaries had seen some flexing of the offensive muscles in both
parties, though against lesser targets. A Bush commercial in car-producing
Michigan reminded that Patrick Buchanan, the 'America first' polemiscist,
drove a Mercedes. This countered a Buchanan commercial in Georgia implying
that Bush was soft on pornography and gays: a Clinton commercial in Florida,
with its large retired Jewish population, implied that Paul Tsongas was
anti-Israeli, while Jerry Brown's advertising came close to implying that
Clinton ordered up a cull of blue collar workers in Arkansas every
Wednesday.
It has long been assumed that Republican strategists have been collecting
material on the private life of Clinton and the outlines of skeletons in the
closet of Ross Perot, the ruthless tycoon, have already been unearthed.
Perot himself has a penchant for ordering up private investigations of those
he dislikes, too.
It could get real dirty. Or, then again, Perot may fade - but not before
bringing about a sea change in the marketing of presidential candidates.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: DoE softens line on unitary
councils
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has softened its view that the review of local government
structure in English shires should lead to a wholesale adoption of unitary
authorities, according to guidance to the independent Local Government
Commission published yesterday.
While Mr Michael Howard, the environment secretary, said that he expected
'substantially more unitary authorities in England after the review is
completed than there are at the moment', the revised guidance explicitly
recognises that 'in some areas the Commission may wish to recommend a
continuation of the existing two-tier structure'.
Mr Howard told a news conference at the environment department in London:
'The government does not wish to impose a national blueprint for reform,
though I expect to see a substantial increase in the number of unitary
authorities as a result of the review.'
The draft guidance published in November by Mr Michael Heseltine expressed
the government's view that unitary authorities could be the most beneficial
structure in most areas.
The guidance also spells out more fully how the commission should approach a
cost-benefit analysis of possible changes to the existing structure, and
extends the prospect of historic districts or cities retaining their
identities without necessarily having councils, much as the draft guidance
raised the possibility of non-administrative counties.
Announcing the commission's programme of work, Mr Howard said it gave
priority to areas 'with a history of dissatisfaction with the existing local
government structure and to produce a balanced and manageable workload for
the new commission'.
As expected, Avon and Cleveland are among the first councils due for review.
The commission will be required to complete its review in a particular area
within eight to 16 months. The government intends that the first new
authorities should be in place for April 1994, and that the changes should
be completed in 1998.
The first five or so members of the commission, which is expected to be
about 12-strong, are likely to be announced within the month. Sir John
Banham, the departing director-general of the CBI, is to chair it and is
already looking for premises and preparing to recruit staff.
Both the Tory-controlled Association of County Councils and the Association
of District Councils welcomed the government's approach, but Mr David
Blunkett, Labour's local government spokesman, said he feared the
government's intention was to attack Labour county councils and 'pursue
their overall agenda of centralisation and privatisation'.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England, however, expressed some
disappointment at the implications of the revised guidance for the
environment. It warned that even the more detailed provisions still risked
devastating the effective operation of land use and planning system under
local authority control.
First tranche: Avon, Gloucestershire, Somerset, Cleveland, Durham,
Derbyshire, Humberside, Lincolnshire, North Yorkshire, Isle of Wight.
Second tranche: Cambridgeshire, Cumbria, Lancashire, Devon, Hampshire,
Leicestershire, Nottinghamshire, Staffordshire.
Third tranche: Bedfordshire, Berkshire, Oxfordshire, Buckinghamshire,
Cheshire, East Sussex, West Sussex, Kent, Northamptonshire.
Fourth tranche: Dorset, Essex, Hereford &amp; Worcester, Norfolk, Suffolk,
Wiltshire.
Fifth tranche: Cornwall, Hertfordshire, Northumberland, Shropshire, Surrey,
Warwickshire.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Commons to hold debate on Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR will next week use its first opportunity of this parliament to choose
the subject for debate to call a full-scale Commons debate on the plight of
the Maxwell pensioners.
The move came as the all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the
pensioners yesterday wrote to to Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of
the Bank of England, requesting him to explain why he had refused to
intervene.
The group will also be writing to the main banks in support of appeals from
the Maxwell pensioners themselves.
Mr Frank Field and Mr Richard Page, the group's co-chairmen, said that the
real focus of the discussion was the urgency of the pensioners' plight.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, will open the debate
on Tuesday, which is expected to concentrate on the need for compensation
for the pensioners. Depending on how the motion is drafted, even Tory MPs
campaigning on behalf of the pensioners might find it difficult to vote
against it.
Last night's meeting of the Maxwell group of MPs agreed to appeal to its
100-plus members to press ministers at Commons questions today about when
the government expects to publish the report by the Securities and
Investments Board into the oversight by the Investment Managers' Regulatory
Organisation (Imro) of Bishopsgate Investment Management, the fund
management company owned by Robert Maxwell which managed the assets of his
company pension funds.
The SIB is said to be concerned that parts of the report may be deemed
libellous and is said to have been told by its solicitors that it may not be
exempt from libel actions.
MPs agreed that to try to avoid this problem, they would press the
government to publish the report as a House of Commons paper, so that the
specific approval of the Commons would then be needed before it could be
used in any legal action.
The House of Lords is to debate the position of the Maxwell pensioners
today, but the junior minister replying is unlikely to be able to pre-empt
the announcement from Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, about
a review of pension law and regulation.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Shares call to NatWest
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRUSTEES of the Mirror Group Newspapers pension scheme have called on
National Westminster Bank to stop delaying and return Pounds 31m in shares
which had been passed to the bank as collateral for a loan to Robert
Maxwell, Norma Cohen writes.
Mr Colin Cornwall, independent chairman of the trustees, said that
pensioners face the immediate loss of their pensions because the schemes are
running out of funds to pay them. 'A large part of the funds missing from
the Maxwell pension schemes went to various banks, including NatWest,' he
said. 'NatWest have been thinking about this for six months now and it is
time they made a decision.'
NatWest has said it will take its civic responsibilities into consideration
when deciding whether to return the shares. It has said it believed the
security to be sound, to have been properly taken and its rightful property
in lieu of loans not repaid by Mr Maxwell.
The bank, however, has declined to return the shares, saying the matter is
still under investigation.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Gould attacks Tory 'will' over Rio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR YESTERDAY used a hastily arranged debate on the Earth Summit in
Brazil to attack the government's environmental record, saying that it
lacked the political will to act on a range of issues.
In a lively series of exchanges with Mr Michael Howard, environment
secretary, Labour's Mr Bryan Gould accused the government of being 'fine
with the high-sounding phrase' but of having no idea what to do beyond
showing awareness of the environmental agenda.
Mr Gould, shadow environment secretary, said the government did not accept
that anything other than market forces would solve environmental problems.
He charged Mr John Major, the prime minister, with backing off very quickly
when confronted with 'the politics of interfering with the free market'.
Mr Howard immediately retorted that the government had always accepted
regulation had a role to play, although market forces contributed 'a
tremendous amount' to solving environmental problems.
Focusing specifically on the summit, Mr Gould criticised the government for
moving to lower expectations, saying the air was 'thick with warnings not to
expect too much'.
A huge diplomatic effort had been undertaken to make common cause with US
recalcitrance and frustrate the world's environmental agenda. There had been
an attempt to 'ensure Rio created nothing more than hot air'.
Mr Howard said Britain would sign the Rio draft treaty addressing threats to
the climate from greenhouse gases, but had concerns regarding the
accompanying document on biological diversity.
The 'primary' obstacles to signing were the financial conditions, he said.
The government was 'exploring urgently' how it could sign without 'signing a
blank cheque'.

FT  04 JUN 92 / House prices 'are still weak'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HOUSE PRICES remain weak and are showing little sign of recovery apart from
the small pick-up which usually occurs at this time of year, according to
Halifax, Britain's biggest building society.
The society, which yesterday published its latest monthly house-price index,
said prices last month rose 0.4 per cent. After taking into account seasonal
fluctuations, prices actually fell 0.5 per cent, it said.
It was the seventh successive month that seasonally adjusted prices had
fallen. On this basis prices had risen only once during the past 12 months,
in October, said the society.
Since April last year the average UK house price of Pounds 62,709 had fallen
6.2 per cent. Prices of new houses had fallen 6 per cent over the same
period to an average price of Pounds 73,629.
Halifax said there had been an improvement in demand since the general
election, but it was no more than it expected at this time of year. The
society added that it expected a further improvement in confidence. As a
result, it forecast that prices would stabilise in the second half of the
year before starting to rise next year.
Nationwide, the UK's second largest building society, has also reported a
small rise in house prices in April. Earlier this week it said prices had
risen 0.6 per cent in April.
Mr John Hutchinson, a Nationwide director, said: 'It is too early to
speculate that this is a sign of a general sustainable improvement.
'People may be less cautious now about making the long-term commitment to
house-buying than they were a few months ago, but there will be need to be a
demonstrable improvement in the economy and in peoples' job security and
confidence before the housing market gets going again.'

FT  04 JUN 92 / Wren Group compulsorily wound up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, LAW COURTS CORRESPONDENT, and RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WREN GROUP, of Sutton, Surrey, was compulsorily wound up in the High Court
yesterday on a petition by the provisional liquidators of Payroll Services,
a group subsidiary that is under investigation by the Serious Fraud Office.
The unopposed petition was based on an inter-company loan of Pounds 20m
between Payroll Services and Wren Group and was supported by the Inland
Revenue, which is a creditor for Pounds 710,000.
The SFO is investigating how Payroll Services, which serves more than 500
banks and financial institutions around London, allegedly diverted more than
Pounds 24m PAYE and National Insurance payments from the Inland Revenue.
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm acting as provisional liquidator to
Payroll Services, says the SFO is also investigating the Wren Group and the
directors of the companies.
The Inland Revenue has extended an informal moratorium on the payment of the
missing taxes.
However, it has told clients of Payroll Services that they will have to make
a second payment if the missing funds are not recovered.

FT  04 JUN 92 / GE wins Dollars 150m contract to equip Medway power plant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GENERAL Electric of the US has won a contract worth more than Dollars 150m
(Pounds 82m) to equip the new Medway electricity generating power plant at
the Isle of Grain in Kent with gas and steam turbines.
The company will supply two gas and one steam turbine generator for the
660MW plant owned by Medway Power, a joint venture between Seeboard and
Southern Electricity - two of the regional electricity companies - and AES
Corporation of the US. The plant is due to start operation in 1995.
GE said yesterday that the Medway contract was its first independent power
plant project in Europe. It was also its first direct European sale of its
9F model, the world's most powerful gas turbine. Previous European orders
have been through GE's network of business associates.
GE and its partners claim to be world leaders in the gas-turbine generation
business. But Westinghouse of the US teamed up this week with Rolls-Royce,
UK aero-engine and industrial power group, to challenge GE's leadership.
Rolls-Royce yesterday announced its first order for an environmentally
friendly combustion system for the industrial derivative of its RB211 jet
engine. Pacific Gas, the US pipeline operator, has ordered three of the
systems for engines being installed in Idaho and Washington for service in
1994.
The new Rolls-Royce process, using a system to reduce oxides of nitrogen and
carbon monoxide emissions, is designed to meet environmental legislation
expected to be introduced soon in many of the company's power markets.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Belling to cut 1,000 jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 1,000 employees of Belling, the electric cooker manufacturer which
went into receivership last week after 82 years in business, are to lose
their jobs.
The receivers appointed to manage Belling, which has been incurring losses
for three years and has debts of around Pounds 25m, said 850 jobs will go at
the company's factory at Enfield in London. A further 260 jobs will be lost
at its factory in Burnley, Lancashire.
The news was greeted with dismay by union representatives. Mr Roger Butler,
of the London executive of the AEEU engineering and electrical union, said:
'Our worst fears have been confirmed. We are particularly annoyed that there
has been no consultation with the unions over these redundancies.'
Mr Patrick McKeown, convener at the Enfield factory, said it was 'shattering
news' for workers who would find it very difficult to get new jobs.
Mr Paul Jeffery, one of the joint receivers appointed from KPMG Peat
Marwick, said the redundancies had been decided after careful consideration
of the company's position.
He said that costs had to be maintained while a buyer for the business was
sought. As a result, it had been neces-sary to halt production at Enfield.
He emphasised that the long-term intention was to sell the business as a
going concern, and held out the prospect that some of the dismissed
workforce could then be re-employed.
About 150 employees will be retained at Enfield to provide a service
operation for customers. At Burnley, where components are manufactured, 40
people will remain on the payroll.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, said the decision illustrated
'the disastrous effect of the recession that is still biting hard into the
British economy'.
He added: 'It is clear the optimism of government ministers has been utterly
misplaced. We now look forward to a summer of mounting job losses and
closures.'

FT  04 JUN 92 / Judge dismisses market-rigging case
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANOTHER City prosecution collapsed yesterday when Mr Peter Marks, a director
of stockbrokers Branston &amp; Gothard, was cleared of attempted market rigging
on the directions of a judge.
Judge Hordern told the jury at Knightsbridge Crown Court that the Department
of Trade and Industry had not proved that Mr Marks made the statement which
was at the root of the prosecution case. He made his direction without
calling on the defence and awarded Mr Marks his costs out of central funds.
Mr Marks had denied a charge under section 47 of the Financial Services Act
of making a misleading, false or deceptive statement to induce share
dealing.
The prosecution alleged that on October 12, 1990, as part of an attempted
'bear raid', Mr Marks told Mr Timothy Medland, then head of UK equity
trading at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, that Maxwell
Communications Corporation would be filing for bankruptcy that day - knowing
it was untrue.
The conversation took place between two others in which Mr Marks agreed to
sell two blocks of 100,000 MCC shares to Goldman Sachs.
The court heard that Mr Marks had told Stock Exchange investigators that he
had merely passed on a story he had heard was 'going the rounds' to Goldman
Sachs because the bank was known to be a big buyer of Maxwell shares.
Judge Hordern said the charge alleged that Mr Marks told Mr Medland that
Maxwell would be filing for bankruptcy that day.
'But Mr Medland's evidence was that what was said to him was either 'I' or
'We believe that Maxwell will be filing for bankruptcy today.'
'That is an entirely different statement. It does not mean the same thing as
'Maxwell will be filing for bankruptcy today,' which is a statement of
something which Maxwell is going to do. To say 'I believe Maxwell will be
filing for bankruptcy' is a statement of what is in your own head.'
After the acquittal Mr Marks' solicitor, Mr Nicholas Munday, of Clifford
Chance, said everyone in the Stock Exchange would be relieved to know that
'a conversation of this kind is not a criminal offence'.
He added: 'Perhaps the DTI will now get on and investigate the creation of
an artificial market in Maxwell shares. The evidence which has emerged
during this case should assist the authorities to get on with that task at
long last.'
During the trial there was evidence that Goldman Sachs had 'a special
relationship' with the Maxwell organisation and that Mr Eric Sheinberg, the
bank's managing director in New York, had been the only person with
authority over a special Maxwell share account.
Witnesses said that in September and October 1990, when there had been
sustained bouts of selling of Maxwell shares amid rumours about MCC's
financial viability, Goldman Sachs had been buying. On October 12 it had
held 23,433,708 MCC shares and dealing records showed that on that day 1m
MCC shares had been sold by Goldman Sachs in London to Goldman Sachs New
York.
A Goldman Sachs marketmaker said that as the MCC price had gone down he had
bought the stock on the instructions of a Goldman Sachs partner in New York.
The Marks case is believed to be only the third prosecution under section 47
of the Financial Services Act - and the second to have failed.

FT  04 JUN 92 / BAe near Pounds 1bn sale of Hawks to India
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Aerospace, the UK aircraft maker, is set to clinch a deal which
could eventually be worth Pounds 1bn to sell Hawk jet trainers to India.
Defence officials in Delhi said yesterday that the Hawk had been selected
for the Indian Air Force.
A contract for an initial batch of up to 100 aircraft is expected to be
signed within weeks, and India will probably seek to set up its own
production and assembly line.
The officials said that India chose the Hawk after considering the Alpha Jet
from Franco-German Dassault-Dornier, and the F-5F from Northrop Corporation
of the US.
The Indian Air Force already has BAe Jaguar aircraft which are maintained by
the state-run Hindustan Aeronautics in the southern city of Bangalore.
An official said: 'There is at least 95 per cent commonality between the
Jaguar and the Hawk engine, so once we get the jet trainer Bangalore will be
in a position to service and maintain the fleet with minimum additional
costs and eventually to assemble and manufacture the components.'
The Hawk uses a modified version of the Jaguar's Rolls-Royce Turbofan
engine.
The aircraft are built at Warton in Lancashire and Brough on Humberside, and
the deal would help safeguard jobs at a time of cuts.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Corporate Britain lays out over Pounds 2.5m for a day at the
races
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HUNDREDS of companies which entertain clients and staff at Epsom's Derby
Day meeting yesterday paid out Pounds 2.5m - but still only half the amount
that the great British public is said to have wagered on Lester Piggott's
chances in the big race. (He trailed home ninth).
The Derby's sponsor, battery maker Ever Ready, accounted for almost half the
total bill for the day's corporate hospitality.
The company laid out just under Pounds 1m for a lunch hosted by Lords Hanson
and White - who this year made their swansong appearances as the Derby's
paymasters - and prize money for the day.
Derby Day guests are the biggest single group of helicopter users outside
the Farnborough Air Show. But the least expensive options for companies
which want a presence at the racing calendar's best-known bonanza lay in the
buses which park along the rail in the middle of the course. 'Passengers'
from companies as diverse as SG Warburg Securities and Currie Motors lined
up in about 100 double-deckers, exuding alcoholic bonhomie.
Back on the other side of the fence, the better-off racegoers watched from
their private boxes.
The least a company can expect to pay for the cachet of a terraced room in
the grandstand is Pounds 10,000 - the cost of renting a standard box for
eight days - plus about Pounds 100-a-head in catering. This option was
favoured by the likes of News International, the newspaper group, and John
Laing Construction.
Extra kudos was available this year in the Queen's Stand which her majesty
opened yesterday.
Lady Beaverbrook and some of the oil sheiks were among those who decided a
box in pristine-white building was worth Pounds 25,000.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Clean-up warning to building groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION companies should reduce noise, wasteful consumption of
materials and energy and clean up building sites and improve their
environmental record, according to a report published by the industry
yesterday.
The report by the Construction Industry Employers Council, which represents
the industry's biggest trade associations, warns that companies face big
fines and directors and employees face imprisonment if they fail to comply
with environmental legislation.
The report, produced by a task force led by Mr Peter Costain, chief
executive of Costain, one of the country's biggest contractors, says the
industry should seek to reduce waste on building sites by 50 per cent by the
year 2000.
It should also cut energy consumption, establish clear standards for
reducing noise and encourage better design, landscaping and land use.
'If we don't, others will and the industry will find itself increasingly
sidelined by ever-increasing amounts of legislation and competition from
abroad,' says Mr Costain.
The report also says all companies should establish an environmental policy
with well-defined objectives.
Marley, the UK building materials group, yesterday launched a scheme to
recycle waste plastics from building sites, in collaboration with Second
Life Plastics, British Polythene's recycling division. Marley said many
building materials were supplied shrink-wrapped in polythene.
A similar scheme launched by Second Life and the farmers' union had resulted
in 4,000 tonnes of polythene film being recycled last year. The Prince of
Wales yesterday renewed his attack on modern urban development and said that
it was partly to blame for the 'horrendous' social problems of inner cities.
Speaking at the launch of a report from the Urban Villages Group, he called
on architects, planners and developers to create living conditions which
enhanced human values.
He commended the report, which covers issues such as location, design and
planning, management, finance and community involvement. It advocates the
creation of 'mixed-use urban developments on a sustainable scale', creating
communities 'where people actually want to live'.
The group was established by Business in the Community in 1989 to
investigate how cities could be made better places to live and work.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Glazing chief blames recession for failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CO-FOUNDER of the failed Surestyle double-glazing business has blamed
paralysis of consumer spending caused by the general election for this
week's failure of Surestyle which left nearly Pounds 3m debts.
Mr Mark Sweeney and his brother Michael paid Pounds 3m for the business
assets of Stormseal a month after it failed in January last year.
They restarted as Surestyle, but the business was undercapitalised with no
cash reserves and the Sweeneys say they discovered an unexpected Pounds
500,000 of current liabilities only after the deal had been done and they
had fuller access to the books.
Mr Mark Sweeney said orders almost dried up at the end of February as the
election approached. When polls suggested a Labour victory, uncertainty
deepened in an already depressed marketplace and people put off plans to buy
big items.
'Things were not brilliant before, but we were at least surviving in January
and February, in spite of the recession,' Mr Sweeney said.
'It was a struggle: the directors have put in a total of Pounds 300,000 of
their own this year and I have not drawn any salary since January; but we
would have got through if trade had not been stopped dead by the election.'
Mr Sweeney said the Conservative victory did not bring quick enough relief
because the dislocation of cashflow had already inflicted a mortal financial
wound. He predicted that other companies hit similarly by national sales
paralysis in March would fail during the summer if they did not have
pre-March cash reserves to tide them over. About 300 people lost their jobs
with the collapse of Surestyle.
'It has taken until the last few weeks to work its way through. We knew it
was coming and devised a financial reconstruction,' he said.
'We had found Pounds 150,000 of new equity investment from outside, private
sources, but we needed our bankers to match that to give us enough working
capital and they decided not to.'
This left Surestyle on the brink of insolvency without enough time to
negotiate a deal with anyone else.
'We could only have gone on if we had been willing to trade illegally, so
there was no choice but to call in the receivers.'
Surestyle's bankers, Svenska Handelsbank, had also backed Stormseal, which
failed with about Pounds 20m of debts. Grant Thornton, Stormseal's receiver,
disclosed this week that virtually all monies recovered from the liquidation
of Stormseal have gone to Svenska, which held debentures. Trade creditors
received nothing.
Mr Sweeney estimates that the direct-sales sector in Britain has been halved
in terms of spending by the downturn. Not only have there been fewer
customers, but the average sale in double-glazing business has dropped from
a consistent Pounds 2,000 during the 1980s to around Pounds 1,400 or Pounds
1,500.
He does not believe people were swayed much by bad publicity about some of
the high-pressure sales techniques used by some of Surestyle's agents, who
were paid on commission. One pair had to be evicted by police after refusing
to leave a potential customer's house without an order. They were sacked.
He denied newspaper allegations that he and his brother lived extravagantly
while their companies failed. Personal assets were usually being used in
some way or another to support entrepreneurship and there was nothing
particularly exceptional about his lifestyle. 'But there always seem to be
some people who think you're only honest if you live in a cave,' Mr Sweeny
added.
A mechanical engineer who did a Harvard Business School course in the
mid-1980s, Mr Sweeney says he will be back.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Pounds 36.8m is overpaid in unemployment benefit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN Pounds 36.8m of unemployment benefit was paid in 1990-91 to
claimants who were not entitled to it, according to the National Audit
Office, which has qualified the accounts of the National Insurance Fund for
the period as a result.
The government expenditure watchdog says that many of the errors arose when
benefit was paid to people who were not unemployed, or who were not
available for work. These overpayments were more than outweighed by
underpayments of Pounds 45.1m for the year.
The NAO has qualified the NI Fund accounts on two other counts, both arising
from doubts over the accuracy of employers' records of employees' earnings:
The amount paid out in earnings-related benefits and government
contributions to personal pensions could not be accurately checked.
The reliability of estimates prepared by the government actuary on the
amount of statutory sick pay and maternity pay paid by employers and
recovered from NI contributions was uncertain.
The Employment Service said the NAO findings were based on a sample of about
1,300 claims. A new quarterly survey of the accuracy of benefit payments
based on a much larger sample showed that more than 95 per cent of payments
were now accurate.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Dollars 19.7m: and that includes the disco
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS built as a favourite toy for a brother of arms dealer Adnan
Khashoggi. Then Robert Maxwell bought it and it became his favourite toy
until his death in November.
Now a glossy 12-page brochure for the yacht the Lady Ghislaine is being
distributed by international shipbrokers Camper Nicholsons in an attempt to
whet the appetite of as yet unenthusiastic buyers.
Although ship brokers originally mooted a price of Dollars 24m for the 180ft
yacht, Camper Nicholsons, with the agreement of Maxwell administrators
Arthur Andersen, has settled for the 'negotiable' price of Dollars 19.7m
(Pounds 10.8m).
The cost of the brochure is being kept secret, in apparent deference to
pensioners who lost money through Maxwell pension funds. 'Marketing expenses
are a complicated arrangement between broker and seller. In this case us and
the administrators,' said Mr Nicholas Baker, Camper Nicholsons' chief London
representative, yesterday.
In its introductory promotion blurb, the brochure tells us that the yacht,
built by the Dutch Amels shipyard, 'has it all'. It is in fact the largest
private yacht in the UK after the Royal yacht Britannia and Gerald Ronson's
My Gail III.
There is no mention in the brochure of Robert Maxwell. However, Mr Baker
conceded yesterday that the boat's association with the one-time media
magnate had 'helped' fuel market interest.
The Lady Ghislaine's special characteristics include a glass-bottomed
whirlpool bath, a sumptuous owner's bedroom and 'staterooms', and a main
saloon with a discotheque area including state-of-the art hi-fi equipment,
strobe lights and an octagonal mahogany dance floor.
We have been asked to point out by Oxford United Football Club that Mr Kevin
Maxwell resigned from the board on May 14, 1992.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Swift action to block cartels urged by Borrie
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT should press ahead quickly with legislation to prevent
cartels emerging in industry, Sir Gordon Borrie, the director-general of
fair trading, said yesterday.
Sir Gordon, who retires this month after 16 years in the job, said that in
his final meeting with Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary,
he had urged him to introduce legislation as soon as possible.
He warned banks in particular that the OFT was watching them to see if they
were operating cartels. He said: 'Small businesses do not have a lot of
choice when it comes to banking services.'
He added that although there was no direct evidence of a cartel, there was a
great deal of concern over the introduction by several banks of charges for
setting up overdrafts.
He also referred to the OFT's fears that the Lloyds bid for Midland might
reduce competition in high street banking. He said: 'When one of the majors
(banks) decides to try and take over another of the majors, one can only
wonder whether this might not make the problem worse.'
The OFT feels that although it has been effective in tackling cartels in
some industries - such as construction materials manufacturing - its present
powers are too limited for it to be sure whether cartels exist in some
industries.
Total complaints to the OFT were 750,000, 8 per cent up on 1990. There was a
particularly steep increase in the numbers of complaints about financial
services, especially about banks and estate agents.
More than 4,000 complaints were received about banks, 63 per cent up on last
year. There were 2,477 complaints about estate agents, 58 per cent up on
1990.
Financial services were well below many other industries for the number of
complaints. The largest category was about house building, fittings and
appliances. There were nearly 237,000 complaints in this category but the
total was slightly down on 1990.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Warning on council job cuts after redundancies ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL-AUTHORITY employ-ers warned yesterday that compulsory redundancies
were more likely after North Tyneside council was refused leave to appeal in
the Lords against a decision declaring an enhanced redundancy scheme
unlawful.
Councils were forced to suspend similar schemes last October when the High
Court agreed with the Audit Commission, the public-expenditure watchdog,
that North Tyneside's payments were 3 1/2 times what it was authorised to
pay.
Many councils are considering cutting staff. Mr Stephen Bubb, assistant
secretary at the Labour-controlled Association of Metropolitan Authorities,
said it increased the likelihood that jobs would have to be shed through
compulsory rather than voluntary means.
North Tyneside, a Labour-controlled authority, was charge-capped in 1990. It
introduced the severance scheme because it said it would have to shed 1,100
jobs to meet the capping level.
However, Mr David Allsop, district auditor for North Tyneside, asked the
High Court to rule that the council had wrongly approved enhanced payments
that were Pounds 1.8m in excess of what it was obliged to offer under the
1972 Superannuation Act.
The council said it had the power to make enhanced payments under the 1972
Local Government Act.
About 350 of the council's employees received payments, while another 59
were frozen pending the High Court hearing.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Lloyd's spiral syndicates hit hard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEARLY HALF the Pounds 2bn loss faced by Lloyd's of London in its 1989
underwriting year will be borne by syndicates which specialised in so-called
spiral catastrophe reinsurance, according to the latest forecasts by
Chatset, which provides detailed analysis of Lloyd's insurance market.
Spiral business - in which Lloyd's syndicates and companies reinsure each
other's exposure to high-level catastrophe risks - is at 'the root of the
debacle', said Mr Charles Sturge of Chatset.
Fifteen syndicates, managed by agents such as Gooda Walker, Feltrim,
Devonshire and Rose Thomson Young - which account for less than 5 per cent
of the market's stamp capacity, or capital base, of around Pounds 11bn -
face the worst losses, with a minority of the 31,329 Names underwriting
during the year bearing a disproportionate share of the loss.
All this is bound to fuel the controversy at Lloyd's about the market's
regulation and will increase pressure on the Lloyd's Council to bail out the
worst-hit Names - individuals whose assets back underwriting.
Outside Names - those who are not market professionals - are heavily
over-represented on the worst-performing syndicates which grew very quickly
during the mid to late 1980s.
Mr John Rew, co-editor of Chatset's reports and himself a Name facing heavy
losses, said: 'There has been a total failure of regulation of the Lloyd's
market.'
He said some Names faced losses which dwarfed the size of their deposits -
the funds Names must lodge with their agents when they join the market.
'Either the deposits are too low, the risks are too great or the risks are
not being monitored properly,' Mr Rew said.
He described the performance of some syndicates as 'absolutely grotesque'.
In spite of recent increases, the size of the Lloyd's deposit - now
equivalent to 30 per cent of the insurance premiums a Name can accept - was
'obviously inadequate'. Lloyd's had also failed to ensure that catastrophe
syndicates were buying adequate reinsurance.
Chatset is also gloomy about the future. It is sticking to its forecasts
that Lloyd's is heading for losses of Pounds 1.15bn for 1990 and Pounds 750m
for last year. Lloyd's produces reports on these years in 1993 and 1994.
The projections were criticised as over-pessimistic by Lloyd's earlier this
year.
The Chatset figures also show the 1989 loss to be heavily concentrated on
the marine market, where syndicates specialised in US liability and spiral
reinsurance, as well as the bread-and-butter business of insuring ships,
their cargoes and oil rigs.
Marine syndicates look set to be hit heavily by their exposure to US
liability risks - such as pollution and asbestos clean-up and
asbestos-related diseases - in which claims can emerge many years after the
policies' are first taken out.
Three of the 10 largest marine syndicates - Janson Green 932, Secretan 367,
and Wellington 448 - have been unable to reach a sufficiently accurate
assessment of these so-called long-tail risks to be able to close their
accounts.

BRITISH COMPANIES are significantly cutting pay packages for staff
transferred to continental Europe, according to the Confederation of British

Most will be offered transfers abroad on terms matching those for locally

children's education.
The research, by the CBI and Mercer Fraser, the consultancy, is based on a
survey of nearly 200 companies. Half employed more than 2,000 people
worldwide.
Companies cited competition, containing costs and the need for equity in the
workplace as the main reasons for reconsidering the remuneration of
expatriates in Europe.
Most organisations provided some sort of assistance with housing but many
were considering ending this system.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Call for probe into financial services rules
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GOVERNMENT review of the regulatory structure for the financial services
industry has been called for by Sir David Walker, departing chairman of the
Securities and Investments Board, the City's chief watchdog.
Sir David, in the SIB's review for the 1991-92 year, said that the structure
is too fragmented and the splintering undermines its effectiveness.
'It is doubtful whether the present system of fragmentation of
responsibilities would be built in if the system were now being designed
afresh, and I believe that present arrangements for regulation of
market-related problems merit early review,' he said.
In particular, he singled out difficulties in investigating market
manipulation or insider trading in securities markets by individuals or
entities not covered by the Financial Services Act as areas where the
oversight of several bodies complicated investigation.
Besides the SIB, responsibility for those areas falls to the Treasury, the
Department of Trade and Industry, the Bank of England and the Stock
Exchange.
The SIB has previously found its investigations slowed down by the need to
consult all supervisory bodies on each new development.
'That this system works as well as it does in these respects reflects good
working relationships among the individual regulators concerned,' Sir David
said.
While Sir David did not specify any particular investigation which had been
hampered by regulatory fragmentation, he noted that the prosecution of the
Blue Arrow and Guinness affairs and the investigation into the collapse of
Mr Robert Maxwell's empire all involved oversight by various regulatory
bodies.
On other matters, Sir David noted that public expectations about the
standards to be expected of financial services regulation have been rising,
possibly causing investors to relax their caution and rely too heavily on
government to protect them. 'Regulation is designed to set a framework for
the raising of standards and for ensuring their compliance, but it cannot
guarantee them or substitute altogether for the application of good sense by
investors,' he said.
On the subject of regulation of retail financial services, Sir David said
that new rules aimed at improving the information for potential customers
have created some dissatisfaction among 'interested parties'. Both consumer
groups and the insurance industry have complained about the new structure,
with the former saying it does not require enough disclosure and the later
saying it requires too much. Sir David said he believed the conclusions
represent 'a good overall balance.'
The SIB has incurred a Pounds 2.36m charge in connection with its former
leased premises. The lease expires in 1995 and the offices are largely
unlet.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NEW orders for US manufactured goods continued to rise in April, adding to
evidence of a distinct but still restrained recovery in economic activity.
The Commerce Department said new orders rose by Dollars 2.4bn or 1 per cent,
the fourth consecutive monthly increase. An increase of 0.7 per cent in
orders for non-durable goods added to the 1.3 per cent rise in durable goods
orders already reported by the department.
Shipments of manufactured goods rose by 0.2 per cent, with higher
non-durable deliveries offsetting a decline in shipments of durable goods.
Economists said the statistics confirmed previous indications of some form
of economic recovery, but shed little additional light on its strength.
Some analysts noted that the pick-up in orders was no stronger than a
similar revival last summer that soon fizzled out.
Adding to caution was the announcement that the value of orders in hand with
manufacturers fell for the eighth consecutive month to Dollars 501.8bn,
their lowest level for nearly three years.
The strongest sectors for new orders in April were home goods and apparel -
where orders climbed by 3.4 per cent - and automotive equipment, up 2.8 per
cent.

FT  04 JUN 92 / US calls meeting of Latin American finance ministers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER, Latin America Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Treasury has called a surprise meeting of finance ministers from
Latin America to discuss trade, debt and investment developments in the
region.
The meeting, expected on June 24-25, will be chaired by Mr Nicholas Brady,
US treasury secretary, and is aimed at furthering the Enterprise for
Americas Initiative announced by President George Bush two years ago.
Mr David Mulford, under secretary for international affairs at the US
treasury, said yesterday he did not expect the meeting to yield any new
initiatives. But it would provide a useful forum to discuss the global
economy ahead of the summit of the Group of Seven industrialised nations in
Munich early next month.
Finance ministers have been invited to Washington from 11 governments which
have reached a Brady debt reduction accord with creditors or benefited from
the Enterprise for Americas Initiative. They include Brazil, Argentina,
Mexico and Venezuela but also smaller economies such as Jamaica, Costa Rica
and El Salvador.
Mr Mulford said that since the Enterprise for Americas Initiative was
announced there had been important progress in resolving debt problems and
stimulating capital flows in Latin America.
Good progress was being made in trade talks with Mexico and Canada on a
North American Free Trade agreement and once an agreement had been reached
the US would start negotiations on a similar accord with Chile.
The Enterprise for Americas Initiative was dealt a setback in April by the
failure of Congress to vote relevant authorisations and appropriations for
debt reduction and the US contribution to a proposed Dollars 1.5bn
multilateral investment fund.
Mr Mulford said the administration would continue to press this issue in the
current year.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Brazil transforms itself from villain into hero
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE surprising star of Earth Summit proceedings so far is Brazil, which has
transformed itself from the villain of the environmental world to playing
one of most constructive roles in negotiations to forge a North-South
consensus.
Mr Celso Lafer, Brazil's foreign minister, says 'we consider that as host
country our efforts should be to transcend specific positions and try to
work out ways countries can find common ground on issues. We're capable of
doing this because our own experience makes us aware of conflicts between
North and south as we have both problems of poverty and industrialisation
within Brazil.'
Not only has the conference organisation been impressive for a country in
economic crisis, but Brazilian diplomacy was instrumental in achieving
agreement on a convention on climate change and its negotiators are
currently working hard to obtain a consensus on the biodiversity treaty.
It is hard to recognise the country that only three years ago remained
defiant and defensive in the face of worldwide censure for its blatant
encouragement (and financial incentives) for the burning down of its forests
in the name of development.
Part of Brazil's new role as defender of the environment emanates from its
desire as host country to be seen as successful and its hope of being
rewarded with the seat of one of the new commissions which may be created as
a result of the summit.
As the fifth largest country in the world it is also eager to make its
presence more felt on the world stage.
This has involved Brazil making compromises over the conference treaties
which officials admit would not otherwise have been considered. Its past
sensitivity on environmental issues, particularly as the home of the world's
largest rainforest and biggest trove of biodiversity, could have easily led
it instead to play a position as hardline as that taken by Malaysia, which
trumpets its unfettered right to dipose of its resources as it sees fit.
Despite Brazil's considerable poverty (40m people live below the poverty
line) President Fernando Collor has made environment a priority issue since
taking office two years ago and fully endorses the concept of sustainable
development. In his opening speech yesterday he said: 'I belong to the
generation that launched the first cry of warning against a mode of growth
that was leading blindly to the extinction of life on Earth.'
It is not just rhetoric. Partly by abolishing subsidies Brazil has reduced
annual deforestation by half since 1989, causing a 1 per cent reduction in
global emissions. Mr Jose Goldemberg, the environment minister, boasts:
'This is the only effective action taken anywhere in world to cut down
emissions'.
Mr Collor is talking of environmental and economic zoning of the Amazon to
protect threatened species, and has demarcated large areas as Indian
reservations, including one the size of Portugal for the 9,000 remaining
Yanomamis.
It is still easy to criticise Brazil for widescale logging and informal
goldmining occurring in the Amazon, but its efforts to make the summit a
success should certainly help it restore some green credentials.

the way: The universal view is that the winner was the man who did not run
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'THIS OBSESSION with Ross Perot is nonsensical,' Ron Brown was saying as the
final curtain closed on the primary season. 'This is June, the election
isn't until November and we haven't even started the general election
campaign.'
The frustration of the Democratic Party's national chairman is
understandable. Tuesday night should have been a crowning moment for his
man, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, who had just swept the last six
primaries and won enough delegates to be mathematically assured of his
party's presidential nomination, barring some improbable coup d'etat against
him between now and the convention in July.
Over at the White House, President George Bush might have been excused for
enjoying similar satisfaction, having pulled off a complete sweep of all the
Republican primaries from New Hampshire onwards. Pat Buchanan's last stand
in California - which he had promised, recalling the civil war, to make a
battle worthy of Antietam for the hearts and minds of the party - had
predictably fizzled.
But Mr Bush had to suffer another distraction yesterday morning when Ms
Sherrie Rollins announced she was resigning her White House communications
post. Though she did not say so, this is presumed to be because her husband,
Ed Rollins, a veteran Republican campaign strategist, has been enlisted by
Mr Perot.
Beyond this particular, every headline, every newscast and every pundit
yesterday morning reached the same conclusion: that the real winner from
California to New Jersey on Tuesday was the man who was not running.
It was, as R W Apple put it in the New York Times, 'another in a series of
shouts of dissatisfaction from an electorate that has been sounding off
against politics as usual, state by state, since the New Hampshire primary
began the political year in February'.
And there, grinning broadly in many a television interview was Mr Perot
himself, chatting merrily about the will of the people, flatly refusing to
answer any questions of substance and blithely accusing the Republican party
of practising 'saturation bombing with dirty tricks' against him.
The evidence for the universal conclusion was not to be found in the ballot
papers of the six states, most of which made write-in voting difficult, but
in the ubiquitous exit polls. Almost everywhere, with the exception of
Republican voters in Ohio, they found that members of both parties would,
given the choice, prefer Mr Perot to either Mr Bush or Mr Clinton.
A Washington Post analysis found Mr Perot's support overwhelmingly white,
predominantly male, and significantly older than the average age of the
country. Primary voters tend to be the most politically committed, whereas
Mr Perot's appeal is among the disaffected. Add them to his putative total
and his current strength becomes truly significant.
The only offsetting findings of the exit polls was that his 'unfavourable'
ratings rose, mostly among Democrats, perhaps a fragmentary sign that
scrutiny of the man himself is beginning to take a toll.
The thrust of all the analysis is that both Mr Bush and Mr Clinton are
limping, not charging, out of the primaries. Both must now decide whether to
take Mr Perot head on or merely hope that exposure will reveal exploitable
flaws. Mr Clinton's prime task is also to pick a running mate, a shrewd
choice of whom could deflect any last-minute attempt to deny him the
nomination.
The hard counted numbers showed that Mr Clinton scored 68 per cent in
Alabama, 61 per cent in Ohio, 59 per cent in New Jersey, 53 per cent in New
Mexico, 47 per cent in Montana, and 48 per cent of an incomplete tally in
California. Jerry Brown got 40 per cent in his native California and no more
than 20 per cent anywhere else.
Mr Clinton won at least 450 of the 700 delegates on Tuesday, ending up,
according to the Associated Press count, with 2,510 delegates, well above
the 2,145 needed for the nomination.
Mr Bush's scores were 83 per cent in New Jersey and Ohio, 75 per cent in
Alabama, 72 per cent in Montana, 67 per cent in New Mexico and 74 per cent
in California, where Mr Buchanan's 26 per cent was the highest he managed
anywhere on Tuesday. The president had weeks ago secured enough delegates
for his renomination.
In other widely-watched races, two women, Dianne Feinstein and Barbara
Boxer, easily won the Democratic primaries for the two vacant US senate
seats in California. Democrats in Iowa selected Jean Lloyd-Jones over
another woman as their Senate candidate. With many other local primaries
still to come, this means there will be at least five women competing this
year for seats in the Senate, which has two female incumbents.
Ms Feinstein will face the interim Republican incumbent John Seymour in
November, while Ms Boxer will be up against Bruce Herschensohn, a very
conservative Los Angeles TV commentator. The latter contest is likely to be
dominated by the abortion issue.
Maureen Reagan, the former president's daughter, failed to win the
Republican nomination for a congressional district in the Los Angeles
suburbs, in spite of campaigning on her behalf by her father. Jane Harman
won the Democratic primary and will face Joan Flores in November.
Two black women, Eva Clayton, a Democrat, and Barbara Gore Washington, a
Republican, won run-off elections in North Carolina for new congressional
districts.
Though some of those victorious yesterday and earlier may lose in the end,
it is apparent that women have rediscovered a political voice this year.
Working for them, in general, are the abortion issue, with even Republican
women critical of the president's pro-life stance, and disgust with the
attacks on Anita Hill during the hearings last year into the nomination of
Supreme Court judge Clarence Thomas.
Incumbents generally fared a little better on Tuesday than in earlier
primaries. Mary Rose Oakar, an eight-term Democrat from Ohio who had
overdrawn her House bank account more than 200 times, survived a challenge,
as, narrowly, did Congressman Bob McEwen in the same state.
Among issues on the ballot in California, voters in Los Angeles easily
passed a 'buy America' amendment to the city's charter, allowing the city
government to prefer California contractors in its procurement orders.
This movement was born last year after a mass transit contract was awarded
to Sumitomo of Japan, though the decision was later reversed. Foreign
investment has been actively sought for the reconstruction of Los Angeles
after the riots.
Also the city approved new restrictions on the power of the Los Angeles
Police Department and its chief, whose conduct over the beating of Rodney
King and during the subsequent disturbances has been heavily attacked.
Mr Ross Perot yesterday hired two top mainstream political strategists to
advise him, Our Foreign Staff writes. Mr Ed Rollins, a Republican who guided
President Reagan's successful 1984 re-election bid, and Mr Hamilton Jordan,
a Democrat who managed Mr Jimmy Carter's 1976 presidential campaign, were
named Mr Perot's co-managers.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Italy pushes energy tax to end impasse: US hits back at
critics on opening day of Earth Summit
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ITALY will propose a new energy tax at today's Earth Summit session in an
attempt to resolve what Mr Giorgio Ruffolo, its environment minister, calls
the 'financial impasse' preventing the realisation of conference targets.
Mr Ruffolo suggested two alternative proposals. The first would extend to
all OECD countries the European Community scheme to place a Dollars 3 per
barrel tax on non-renewable energy sources from 1993, increasing by Dollars
1 a year until the year 2000.
This would, he said, yield Dollars 70bn-Dollars 200bn a year, which could be
used to finance targets agreed at the summit such as energy saving and
technological co-operation with developing countries.
The more modest suggestion is for a Dollars 1 per barrel energy tax in all
OECD countries, which he said would yield Dollars 25bn a year and cut carbon
emissions by 0.5 per cent.
The money would go into a sustainable development fund. Mr Ruffalo said
European colleagues had responded favourably to his proposal, but admitted
'it may not be a proposal for the conference itself but a process which
begins here'.
He warned that 'the proof of the pudding is in the eating and the proof of
this conference will be in the willingness of rich countries to provide the
huge investments needed by the poor to develop and protect the environment'.
Meanwhile, the US, singled out by many as the villain of the summit before
it even started, used yesterday's opening day to hit back at its critics and
defend the positions it has adopted on the main issues.
Mr William Reilly, administrator of the Environment Protection Agency, said:
'We are proud of our environmental record. We have more forests and cleaner
rivers today than 100 years ago.'
Mr Reilly arrived to a fiercely hostile reception from the vast audience
because of the obstructive role the US is seen to have played in negotiating
the treaties before the summit. It forced a compromise on a treaty to limit
greenhouse gases, and has refused to sign a second one protecting biological
diversity.
Athough intense diplomatic efforts are under way behind the scenes to get
the US to alter its position, Mr Reilly thought it unlikely that sufficient
changes could be negotiated in the two weeks for the US to change its mind.
He also dismissed an option being considered by other countries: a side
declaration expressing reservations. Instead, he said that the main US
object was to achieve a satisfactory declaration to protect the world's
forests. The US would be contributing over Dollars 500m a year (an increase
of Dollars 150m) to the Dollars 2.7bn it hoped donor countries would give to
improve world forest management each year.
Despite Mr Reilly's efforts to add a constructive note to his statements and
his spirited performance, his appearance cast a pall over the opening day
and dampened expectations that the summit's already much weakened proposals
for action could be strengthened.
As the summit opened yesterday Brazil's President Fernando Collor, who will
preside over the 12-day gathering, pressed what is likely to be one of the
central themes by emphasising the links between economic backwardness and
environmental degradation.
'We cannot have an environmentally sound planet in a socially unjust world,'
he told delegates from 180 countries.
He urged them to aim for 'sustainable development - the key concept which
must bring together rich and poor, large and small countries, so that we may
all achieve prosperity and shorten the distances that separate us'.
The theme was picked up by other dignitaries at the opening: King Gustav of
Sweden, President Mario Soares of Portugal and Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland,
Norway's prime minister.
Tight security added to the tension of the event, and inflame tempers in
Rio's stifling heat. Queues of people and cars accumulated early around the
conference centre.
After the opening ceremony, the summit broke up into committees which will
work on the documents to be signed by heads of state at the end of next
week.

   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas de Gortari of Mexico says the North American free
trade agreement (Nafta) talks could be over within weeks, and he sees no big
stumbling block to reaching an accord.
He said in an interview that serious issues remained to be resolved,
including rules of origin that determine the minimum amount of regional
content for goods to be eligible for free trade, tariff reductions, rules
governing foreign investment, and agriculture. 'Some (of these issues) are
practically over,' he added. 'Some require additional steps.'
The president made a plea for European investment, suggesting that 'those
who invest in Mexico will have a better chance to participate in this huge
regional market'.
Mr Salinas, who will visit the UK, France, Spain and Hungary in July, added:
'We would like to have a strong commercial agreement with the European
Community' within the framework of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade.
The president hinted at his, and no doubt US President George Bush's, likely
pitch in selling the agreement to US Congressmen and voters. 'I want to
export goods, not people; therefore with the agreement we would like to
create more employment opportunities and reduce migration into the US.'
Above all, 'we want the capacity to compete with Europe and the Asian
pacific countries, not as a closed fortress but as an open region in accord
with Gatt regulations'.
Mr Salinas called for a reform of the United Nations, urging that more power
be given to the General Assembly and that the veto power of the five
permanent members of the Security Council be 're-thought'.
Warming to this theme, he suggested 'it was not easy to have a neighbour in
the US'. Mexico's improvement of ties with Washington was a 'strategic
decision'. A better relationship with the US meant Mexico would be in a
better position to compete with other regions in the world.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US aloofness in Rio is already getting on people's nerves. All the major
delegations are installed in the Rio Centro conference centre, but the US
has insisted on maintaining its headquarters at the Sheraton Hotel 20 km
away.
This not only means staff are isolated from events, but the whole press
corps has to uproot itself from the centre to the Sheraton for the daily
midday briefing.
US representation at the centre does not even constitute a proper
delegation. It consists of an office of the US Information Service whose
staff are full of smiles but short on the service their name purports to
provide.
Arriving in Brazil, the land of 1,500 per cent annual inflation, has been a
heady experience for delegates from more price stable economies. Merely
changing Dollars 250 yields over half a million cruzeiros at this week's
exchange rate. But anyone who feels a sudden onset of riches is quickly
disabused. A Coca Cola costs a princely 3,000 cruzeiros at the Centro bar,
and a local beer 4,000.
A taxi ride in Rio costs anything between 5,000 and 10,000 cruzeiros. It
costs many millions to make a down payment on a mobile phone rental.
The massive sums involved in the most trivial transactions mean people have
to carry sheaves of bank notes with dizzying numbers of noughts. When you
are in a hurry it is easy to confuse 10,000 with 100,000, and the sharper
operators in Rio have latched on to that fact.
But lest taxi drivers feel tempted to overcharge, the government has posted
special officials at hotel entrances to check that arriving guests pay no
more than their due.
Merely during the period of the summit, Brazilian prices will rise by nearly
20 per cent, a sobering thought for the eco-minded.
Brazil's less than subtle security arrangements for the Earth Summit, which
involve tanks on street corners, nearly claimed a costly casualty. On the
first day of operations a Japanese delegation was waiting in the conference
centre to sign a Dollars 300m loan for Brazil's National Development Bank -
the first Eximbank lending to Brazil for seven years.
Brazilians are not known for their punctuality but as the minutes ticked on
the Japanese started looking at their watches and muttering. Finally the
word came back - Mr Eduardo Modiano, the bank's president, had come by
helicopter to shorten the one hour journey by road. But the military would
not let him land and in fact had their guns trained on the helicopter.
So stringent are the security arrangements that those used to Rio's high
crime rate are staggered to find that the biggest danger at present is not
being robbed, but being given things. More than 2,000 non-governmental
organisations are present in Rio, all eager to make their views known.
It is impossible to walk the streets without being burdened with handouts
denouncing pollution by multinationals, advertising women's vigils on the
beach, or advertising Esperanto lessons. Even the most cunning delegate
cannot avoid ending each day with a rucksack full.

<TEXT>
THE CHAIRMAN of India's largest bank became the latest casualty of the
widening securities scandal yesterday after the bank was fiercely criticised
in an official report.
The report, published by the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, said
funds had been diverted from the banking system through 'massive collusion'
between banks and brokers. The scandal has exposed banks to losses of as
much as Rs30.8bn (Pounds 610m).
Mr MN Goiporia, chairman of State Bank of India, was not personally named in
the report. But he was told by the Reserve Bank to go on holiday until the
end of next month. His retirement had been scheduled for July 31.
The report, from a committee appointed by the Reserve Bank and headed by its
deputy governor, Mr R Janakiraman, said the State Bank had allowed Mr
Harshad Mehta, the broker at the centre of the scandal, to use the bank's
securities account with the central bank 'virtually . . . as if it is (his)
investment account'.
The bank had channelled Rs170bn of transactions through Mr Mehta to the
beginning of April.
Last month, another senior State Bank official, deputy managing director Mr
CL Khemani, was also asked to go on leave indefinitely. State Bank accounts
for about one-third of commercial banking assets in India.
Standard Chartered, the UK-based international bank, said yesterday that it
expected to recover most of the Rs10.55bn which the Reserve Bank says is its
exposure to the affair.
The Reserve Bank report was critical of another foreign bank, ANZ Grindlays,
for paying cheques totalling Rs5bn, which were made out in its own name,
into an account belonging to Mr Mehta. Grindlays is refusing to refund the
money to the National Housing Bank, which issued the cheques.

   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG is to liberalise the colony's telecommunications market, paving
the way for at least a second domestic competitor to Hongkong
Telecommunications, the local private monopoly, when its exclusive franchise
expires in 1995.
The government has reached agreement with Hongkong Telecom to change the
method by which the local telephone company's prices are regulated, a move
which will lead to prices rising more slowly than inflation.
Local cellular telephone operators will also have easier and cheaper access
to the international telephone call market.
Hongkong Telecom is 58.5 per cent owned by Cable &amp; Wireless of the UK. Last
week, it reported a 14 per cent growth in net earnings to HKDollars 5.67bn
(Pounds 407m).
The decision to allow more competition is in keeping with a tougher line
that the government is taking against monopolies in the colony. This week,
it cut the number of exclusive routes operated by China Motor Bus in
response to consumer pressure.
Mrs Elizabeth Bosher, acting-secretary for economic services, said the new
arrangement represented a good deal for consumers in Hong Kong. The opening
of the market after 1995 would enable competitors to set up competing
networks to provide fixed-link voice telephone services, she said.
Officials said the government had not yet determined whether to open the
market to all-comers or to limit it to companies that meet specific
requirements.
However, they stressed that the government would not seek to pick winners.
'We do not want to take a stake in a new entrant's success,' one said.
Mr Michael Gale, chief executive of Hongkong Telecom, said that the new
pricing formula would encourage efficiency and innovation.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Danes face leaner future within
EC
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR 20 years the Danes have enjoyed the economic benefits of European
Community membership. At the same time they have shown no interest in
political integration which would lead to a European union. Having the best
of both worlds may prove much more difficult after Tuesday's referendum
result.
Not that the Danes want to leave the Community. A Gallup poll earlier this
week showed 67 per cent wanting to remain in the EC, with only 21 per cent
against.
But there is scant support for any moves towards federalism, a point that Mr
Poul Schluter, the prime minister, was keen to stress in his 'Yes to
Maastricht' campaign. He told voters that all they were being asked to do
was to back further political co-operation.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister, yesterday described a United
States of Europe as nothing more than a 'beautiful dream' which could not be
realised. Mr Hans Jorgen Nielsen, of Copenhagen's Institute of Political
Science, said: 'No Danish survey whatsoever has shown sympathy for
strengthening supranational institutions or the existence of a European
identity.'
The voters who said No reflected a cross-section of opinion, stretching
beyond protest groups familiar in other anti-EC campaigns. The loss of
political sovereignty emerged as a burning issue.
The gender gap was particularly noticeable - nearly 60 per cent of women
rejecting the Maastricht treaty. Danish women seem to have been swayed by
the argument that a vote for Maastricht would threaten the social welfare
system and be a step nearer a European army.
There was a comfortable Yes majority among men. The second largest group of
No voters came from supporters of the main opposition Social Democrats.
Their recently elected leader, Mr Poul Nyrup Rasmussen, has been attacked
for not being effective enough in its Yes campaign. Around 60 per cent of
his party's supporters voted No.
A group of No voters, who helped to tip the balance, was identified as
fishing communities on the West Jutland coast, once staunch supporters of
the EC. They were apparently protesting at what they see as the bureaucratic
way in which the common fisheries policy is administered by Brussels.
Opinions differ on the future of Danish politics. The Social Democrats would
like to cash in on their supporters' evident disaffection with the
government, but the parliamentary balance has not changed and the next
general election could be at least two years off.
But Mr Ellemann-Jensen warns: 'We have a crisis of confidence between the
voters and the political parties.' He points out that only a few weeks ago
the Danish parliament voted 130-25 in favour of ratifying the treaty.
Mr Nielsen disagrees. 'It is hardly a general revolt against the
politicians. The parties are not being punished. The Social Democrats
continue to be strong.' In his opinion the outcome came down to a simple
lack of interest among Danes in the outside world.

for Community candidates
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE LIKELIHOOD that the Community would begin opening its doors to new
members soon after the Maastricht treaty came into effect next year has been
considerably reduced by the Danish vote.
Those member states most committed to European union are also likely to be
reluctant to enlarge the EC to include Denmark's Nordic neighbours and
Alpine associates within the European Free Trade Association (Efta)  - at
least until EC integration is further advanced.
While the immediate problem the Community faces is to salvage the treaty,
the Danish vote signals the start of battle between the 'deepeners' and
'wideners' - those who emphasise integration and a more federal union
against those pressing for early enlargement, and perhaps dilution, of the
Community.
It will be more difficult to argue that the two processes are compatible,
given that a solution found to accommodate Denmark opens the way to a
'Europe a la carte', in which actual and potential member states can choose
what policies they want to be involved in.
There are currently seven formal applicants for EC membership and more
waiting in the wings. The Maastricht summit instructed the European
Commission to prepare a report on enlargement for this month's Lisbon
summit.
The Commission's preliminary conclusions were that the five Efta countries
of Austria, Sweden, Switzerland, Finland and Norway (assuming Norway also
applies) could be admitted before 1996 - when the EC's next constitutional
review is due - provided they accepted current EC law and the 'potential' of
the Maastricht treaty.
This means accepting not only greater EC powers in more areas (the Treaty of
Rome modified by Maastricht and including economic and monetary union), but
the two new 'pillars' of the union. These cover a common foreign and
security policy, leading towards a common defence, and increased
co-operation in justice and home affairs, both to be conducted through
intergovernmental agreement, but with the likelihood of greater involvement
of the European Commission and parliament after 1996.
From next year, the Efta countries will be associated with the EC in the
European Economic Area. This all but certifies that these countries'
economies are compatible with the EC. But membership would imply accepting
the EC's political aims, and in particular abandonment of neutrality
traditions common to all Efta candidates except Norway.
For the east Europeans, the situation is reversed. Hungary, Poland and
Czechoslovakia now have 'Europe agreements' giving them access to EC markets
during a 10-year transition towards a free trade regime, and the possibility
of membership thereafter.
But while it is agreed that the central European economies could not
withstand EC membership in even the medium term, there was always the
possibility of easing the long transition by binding them more closely to
the Community politically. Mr Frans Andriessen, external affairs
commissioner, last year canvassed the possibility of affiliate membership,
allowing the central Europeans into the EC's foreign policy deliberations,
for example. Yet this already minority position now looks very exposed.
One solution being suggested yesterday for Denmark was the 'a la carte'
option - 'variable geometry' in the EC jargon - which is such anathema to
federalists. This would involve Denmark accepting the beefed-up Treaty of
Rome but staying out of foreign and home affairs.
But if a special deal is found for Denmark - and this is by no means assured
 -federalists can be guaranteed to fight to ensure it is a one-off.
A majority of the Commission, and of the member states, with France and
Germany at their core, are radically opposed to 'variable geometry', and can
be relied on to insist that new members sign up for the whole Euro-trip.
Even the UK is suspicious of the 'a la carte' formula although some British
officials talk of 'a series of fixed menus'.
Mr Jacques Delors, Commission president, yesterday talked of 'consequences'
for 'the prospects of enlargement, at least of the kind we had in mind'.
Senior officials translate this to mean no early opening to Efta before the
1996 review. The original case for delay was to enable the EC to streamline
its creaking procedures and strengthen its leadership. Leaks indicating that
the Commission was considering such options, which would downgrade the
position of smaller countries in a larger Community, are considered to have
helped fuel the No vote in Denmark.
But the Commission was considering such changes for after 1996, by when the
Efta states would be inside the EC, able to take part in shaping
institutional reform. The effect of Tuesday's vote is to make that
possibility remote.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Italian business fears loss of
resolve
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITALIAN business community yesterday voiced fears the result of the
Danish referendum would undermine Italy's resolve to comply with the tough
conditions of convergence laid down at the EC's Maastricht summit last
December. These fears were immediately reflected in a weakening of the lira.
Official reactions were more muted and there was no suggestion of an Italian
referendum, even though it is the Community country most used to
referendums. The Maastricht treaty has yet to be ratified in parliament.
The government being only a caretaker, Mr Gianni de Michelis, the outgoing
foreign minister, was obliged to speak in a personal capacity, insisting
that the Maastricht treaty was irreversible and so Europe had to go ahead as
'the eleven'.
The Danish rejection of Maastricht comes as Italian politicians are just
beginning to recognise that big economic and fiscal adjustments are
necessary to bring Italy into line with its main EC partners.
A tough speech at the weekend by Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the
Bank of Italy, warned that the country risked being an obstacle to European
integration unless the politicians urgently introduced an austerity package
and important reforms.
This speech was widely seen as the agenda for the next government. It is
this agenda that is now at risk, according to Mr Innocenzo Cippoletta,
director-general of Confindustria, the industrialists' confederation.
'It would be a tragedy if this episode were to be used by Italy as an excuse
not to implement the economic policies required by convergence,' he said
yesterday. It would be all too easy to conclude that Italy did not have to
respect all the rules, he added.
The lira yesterday weakened against the D-Mark, moving from L753.4 to above
755. This is the upper limit acceptable to the Bank of Italy; the latter is
understood to have intervened by selling D-Marks. The last time the lira
touched such levels was in the aftermath of the general election on April 5.
Mr de Michelis said 'the path towards integration as eleven' would not
preclude Denmark from re-entering, but only on the basis of its acceptance
of the Community as it was.
He added that he agreed with France and Germany that negotiations with new
prospective members should be accelerated.

THE PROGRESS and pace of European monetary union as agreed at Maastricht
hangs in the balance following yesterday's vote in Denmark. What need not be
threatened, however, is closer convergence of European economies.
Even if the Maastricht treaty was not ratified and economic and monetary
union did not occur in ways laid out in it, this need not be the end of
convergence, exchange rate stability, or even moves towards monetary union.
The exchange rate mechanism of the European monetary system has developed
into a durable, fixed rate regime. There has been no general realignment
since January 1987.
Inflation rates and differences among interest rates, both short and long,
have narrowed considerably. Exchange rate controls have been lifted in
virtually every participant in the ERM, the exceptions being Ireland and
Portugal. The EC has already gone a very long way towards creation of a
fixed exchange rate regime and an integrated capital market, open to the
world.
The ERM includes 11 of the EC's 12 member states, Greece being the
exception. Eight members are within the narrow 2 1/4 per cent divergence
limits; three - Spain, the UK and Portugal - are within the broader 6 per
cent bands. A number of non-EC countries are honorary members of the ERM.
Austria is the longest standing member of that club, its currency being
pegged to the D-Mark. The Finnish, Norwegian and Swedish currencies are now
pegged to the Ecu.
The question is whether the outcome of the Danish referendum could undermine
the stability of this creation and, in particular, prospects for further
monetary and fiscal convergence.
That it will call both into question is evident. But it may still be
possible to cajole the treaty through, though a greater degree of
instability is to be expected in the meantime.
But convergence, exchange rate stability and even monetary union could still
be attained.
The ostensible determination of most members of the EC to move to Emu became
evident only late in the ERM's history. The committee of central bankers
under the chairmanship of Jacques Delors, Commission president, that was
charged with examining the implications of economic and monetary union, was
established by the European Council in Hanover in June 1988.
Thus, much of the inflation convergence occurred before Emu was more than a
distant aspiration. In the cases of the UK and Spain, much of that
convergence even occurred outside the ERM.
Furthermore, the effects of German unification on German inflation, rather
than lower inflation elsewhere, have been among the most important causes of
recent convergence.
So long as fixed exchange rates can be maintained, further convergence of
inflation can be expected. There is no reason, in principle, why such
stability could not be secured. Fixed rate regimes, without exchange
controls, have been stable in the past. But they do require a determination
to put exchange rate stability above all other objectives in the setting of
monetary policy.
Failure of the Maastricht treaty need not affect that determination,
provided it has been grounded in a politically entrenched conviction that a
policy of low inflation and exchange rate stability, with what such a policy
entails for fiscal deficits and public debt, is in the interests of each
individual country.
It will make a difference, however, wherever the political commitment to
full participation in the evolution of the EC has itself been a principal
reason for the economic policy.
Among major countries, France, the UK and Spain must be deemed likely to
persist with their already established policies. Italy is a more uncertain
proposition, given the scale of the changes required, especially in its
fiscal policies, given also the Italian political impasse and the importance
of its founder-membership of the EC in Italian politics.
The Maastricht convergence criteria themselves are not precise targets. The
pressure any such targets exert need not be much less in the absence of a
treaty than in the presence of what was both an ambiguous and unassertive
one.
In one area, however, the disappearance of the treaty could make a
noteworthy difference. Bond rates. The most peculiar requirement of the
treaty is that long term interest rates of countries admitted to Emu should
'not exceed by more than 2 per cent that of, at most, the three best
performing member states in terms of price stability'.
But should participation of a given country within Emu be confidently
expected, then such convergence would have occurred long before.
Such a process could be at work now. But evidence for this would be that
long term bond rates are closer together than inflation, implying an
expectation of further convergence and ultimately, Emu.
The opposite is, in fact, the case. Bond rates diverge more than inflation.
This being so, any failure of the treaty need have no dramatic effect on the
bond market, except where that failure affects underlying inflation
performance as well, the main risks once more being in Italy or, of course,
in the case of the bond market most exposed to Emu, that for the Ecu itself.
Even if the Maastricht treaty were to fail, that need not be the end of
moves to Emu. Either formal treaties or ad hoc arrangements can be made to
tie the currencies of member states closer together, though this would
depend much on the German attitude to any such arrangement.

cross big divide

THE MESSAGE from Denmark that was resounding around the European Community
yesterday was that governments cannot necessarily deliver what they sign up
to with their partners.
The first high-level EC conclave to discuss the fall-out - a solemn, closed
session of the European Commission yesterday morning - was under no
illusions.
'It will take very careful and skilful management to get Maastricht adopted,
to keep going,' said one senior Commission official after the meeting.
There are genuine fears in Brussels that the Maastricht treaty could unravel
as the ratification process goes on throughout the rest of the Community.
The greatest concern is that national parliaments will begin to pick away at
the treaty's political union objectives, in some cases because they are too
ambitious, but in more instances because they do not go far enough.
The treaty extends and widens the EC's law-making competence, envisages
greater use of majority voting (thereby weakening national vetoes), and
gives the directly elected European Parliament greater legislative and
scrutiny powers. It gives the future European Union a common foreign policy
and defence dimension, and foresees greater co-operation on justice matters,
ranging from immigration to terrorism.
UK objections to Maastricht's original social policy ambitions led to its 11
partners making separate provisions for more advanced laws through a
protocol to the treaty. And in what should become a move towards more
federal fiscal arrangements, Spain and the southern countries won agreement
for greater transfers from the richer countries.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal which currently holds
the EC presidency, insisted yesterday: 'There is no room for renegotiation'
of the treaty. 'There is strong unanimity that the 11 should go ahead
without any hesitation to fulfil the objectives they set out,' he added, a
view confirmed by governments in virtually all national capitals. Mr Jacques
Delors, Commission president, read a statement calling for ratification of
the treaty to go ahead as planned, 'in order to achieve the general
objectives adopted at Maastricht'.
The Commission strategy appeared to be to urge rapid assent in the rest of
the EC and then try to get a deal with the Danes. Delay risks the leakage of
Danish Euro-scepticism into other countries.
In Germany, there is widespread angst that the D-Mark will be surrendered
for a less solid single currency within monetary union, but equal concern
that there is not enough democratic accountability in the treaty to
compensate the transfer of sovereignty. In France there is concern both
about sovereignty and the treaty's granting of the vote to foreigners in
municipal and European elections. UK officials say they remain satisfied
they got a good treaty at Maastricht, but fear the Danish outcome could fan
the embers of Euro-scepticism in the Tory Party.
The Dutch, Belgians and Italians all demanded more powers for the European
Parliament. 'Some of our MPs will say: 'why not now push our governments to
make this or that amendment?',' a Dutch diplomat said.
In Ireland, a 'yes' vote in this month's referendum would safeguard only an
unamended treaty. Any change might risk a new referendum, and provoke
collision with the abortion plebiscite later in the year. The southern
countries, Spain, Portugal and Greece, are solidly behind the treaty, but
only if it delivers the extra cash it promises but does not detail.
That detail is contained in the 'Delors II' five-year finance package for
1993-97, which forsees a 30 per cent increase in EC revenue. The package is
stalled by opposition, led by Germany and the UK. A settlement was expected
at December's Edinburgh summit under the UK presidency, but the Danish
imbroglio now makes that deadline doubtful.
Legally viable solutions to the crisis were being mooted yesterday, starting
from the bottom line that the treaty as currently writ requires 12 votes to
come into effect. One possibility was that all 12 'denounce' the existing
Treaty of Rome, for all except Denmark then to embrace Maastricht, leaving
the Danes to decide whether to reaffirm the Rome Treaty or withdraw to the
European Economic Area. This treaty comes into effect next year and spreads
the EC single market to Denmark's former colleagues in the European Free
Trade Association.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Serious blow to bonds market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE market in European government bonds thrived last year on almost one word
 -convergence. Dealers and investors piled into high-yielding bonds, hoping
to benefit from falling inflation and lower interest rates as the
high-yielding markets converged with those in Germany. But Denmark's
rejection of the Maastricht treaty is a serious blow to such convergence
trades.
The European government bond markets were driven upwards in 1991 largely by
the convergence argument, and immediately after the Maastricht summit, they
rallied strongly.
Investors were eager to put funds into the high-yielding bond markets - such
as those of Spain, Italy and Portugal - in the hope of making substantial
capital gains as interest rates came down.
However, while many of the market participants were committed to
convergence, the European bond markets saw less scope for convergence in
much of 1992 for two main reasons - worries about German inflation (and
hence the level of German interest rates), and the uncertainty about a
change of government in the run-up to the British general election.
Economists point out that, following the Danish referendum, convergence
trades will cease until the bond markets have a clearer picture of what
happens to Maastricht.
'Obviously the situation is one in which those markets which have been most
dependent on the convergence argument are facing the most problems,' says Mr
Peter Fellner, UK financial analyst at NatWest Capital Markets. 'But we
don't know yet what is going to replace Maastricht.'
Economists expect to see some 'de-convergence' of yields now - in other
words yield spreads over German government bonds are likely to widen, rather
than narrow.
Mr Brian Martin, economist at Yamaichi International in London, says: 'Until
we get a clearer picture, convergence in the European government bonds will
not go ahead and markets relative to bunds (German government bonds) will
underperform.'
However, he points out that one of the factors which will now hold back the
bond markets is the prospect of a realignment in the European monetary
system's exchange rate mechanism. While an immediate realignment is not
expected, the markets may start to worry about the prospect of a realignment
in the longer term.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Industrialists say vote ignores
market realities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Financial Times Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN industrialists, stunned by the unexpected outcome of the Danish
referendum, were anxiously seeking yesterday to assess the wider
implications for their companies' operations and the future business climate
in the Community.
The most dire predictions came, not surprisingly, from Denmark, where Lego,
the toy manufacturer, said the referendum outcome had prompted it to
postpone a DKr300m (Pounds 26.6m) investment in a new factory and education
centre in Jutland.
Lego said it feared Denmark would soon have no influence on EC policies,
notably in the field of harmonisation. Similar concerns were expressed by Mr
Anders Knutsen, managing director of Bang &amp; Olufsen, the hi-fi and
television manufacturer.
'Our future growth must take place in markets such as France, Germany, Spain
and Italy. If Denmark finds itself having no influence on EC decisions and
this has consequences for B&amp;O, we shall have to look at the situation,' he
said.
Elsewhere, the interest was more in the consequences for the progress of EC
integration. In France, Mr Francois Perigot, chairman of the Patronat, the
national employers' association, warned that every day lost on the path to
monetary union was 'negative for the prosperity, the competitiveness and the
development of our companies'.
However, Mr Heinz Schimmelbusch, chief executive of Metallgesellschaft, the
large German mining and industrial group, who said big European companies
were already acting as if the Maastricht treaty had been implemented,
stated: 'This strategy has created a reality in European corporate life
which will not be changed by Danish voters.'
Sir Michael Angus, president of the Confederation of British Industry,
described the vote as 'sad and serious'. Though he did not think the
situation irretrievable, it was a 'warning bell' to Brussels.
But many other senior executives were literally at a loss for words
yesterday. Attempts to elicit their views on the significance of the
referendum result met repeatedly with the response: 'It's far too early to
tell.' Nonetheless, except in Denmark, few businessmen appeared to fear any
immediate fall-out. Suggestions that the result might slow the pace of
cross-border business expansion and takeovers were widely dismissed.
Mr Hans Eggerstedt, commercial director of Unilever, the Anglo-Dutch
consumer products group, said the rapid achievement of monetary union had
become less important since sterling's entry into the EMS had reduced
currency instability. Opinions were much more divided, however, on whether a
prolonged setback to the Maastricht treaty would weaken the EMS or, on the
contrary, encourage EC governments to reinforce the system to reassure
financial markets.
The other principal focus of European business is on the single market
programme, due to take effect at the end of this year. It is widely felt
that work on the legislation has advanced so far that the programme is
unlikely to be weakened, still less reversed.
Nonetheless, some important decisions remain to be taken in Brussels on
issues including investment services, capital adequacy and takeover law.
Another closely related issue is liberalisation of the energy market, which
the UK had hoped to promote strongly during its EC presidency in the second
half of the year.
Many businessmen now fear - though some of those threatened by fiercer
competition may secretly hope - that these issues will now slip to the
bottom of the agenda as the EC struggles to get the Maastricht bandwagon
back on the road.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Reactions to Danish veto
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BELGIUM
Mr Willy Claes, the foreign minister, regretted what he called 'the very
slightly negative result of the Danish referendum.' Belgium, he said,
'remains committed to pursue, with its European partners, the direction
indicated by the Maastricht treaty.' Mr Jean-Luc Dehaene, the prime
minister, said: 'We will just have to sit down and see what we do now.'
Coincidentally, parliament yesterday began its ratification procedure of the
treaty.
DENMARK
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, said Denmark would seek to
renegotiate parts of the Maastricht treaty but was not optimistic about the
reaction of its European Community partners. He said he would raise the
issue at an EC foreign ministers meeting in Oslo today. Mr Ellemann-Jensen
also described the idea of a United States of Europe as nothing more than a
'beautiful dream' which could not be realised.
FRANCE
President Francois Mitterrand, a driving force behind the Maastricht treaty,
announced that France would hold a referendum on the pact. He said, however,
that there was no need to renegotiate the treaty because of its rejection in
Denmark. 'Eleven of us will do what twelve cannot,' he was quoted as saying
by government spokesman Martin Malvy.
'Renegotiating the treaty is not necessary at all.'
GERMANY
Mr Klaus Kinkel, the foreign minister, regretted the Danish vote and said
that other European Community states must press on with ratification of the
Maastricht treaty. Mr Hans-Dietrich Genscher, the former foreign minister
and a leading figure in forging the treaty, said it might be possible to
offer Denmark special treatment similar to the United Kingdom's opt-out
clause relating to the treaty's social provisions.
GREECE
The Greek parliament, where the pro-European conservative government holds
only a slim majority, has yet to set a date for debate on the Maastricht
treaty.
Greeks are overwhelmingly in favour of European political and economic
union, according to public opinion polls, but much depends on whether the
government can build a consensus on the need to achieve economic convergence
within the European Community.
IRELAND
The government confirmed that the country's referendum on the Maastricht
treaty would go ahead as planned. 'There is no question of calling off the
June 18 poll,' a spokesman said. Nevertheless, the government held emergency
talks yesterday in the wake of the Danish vote, and the opposition Labour
Party leader Mr Dick Spring was expected to support calls in parliament for
a postponement to allow for the situation to be clarified.
ITALY
Mr Gianni De Michelis, the foreign minister, said that Italy was in
principle opposed to the Danish request to renegotiate the Maastricht pact
but was prepared to study the proposal. The office of Prime Minister Giulio
Andreotti noted the Danish vote 'with regret' but said that Italy reaffirmed
'its firm determination to carry out new steps forward on the path of
European construction according to the same lines traced at Maastricht.'
LUXEMBOURG
The government, which is expected to achieve parliamentary ratification of
the Maastricht treaty after some strenuous debate over constitutional
amendments, refrained from official reaction to the Danish vote. One serious
uncertainty, however, is the position of the opposition Liberals, since a
qualified parliamentary majority is needed, with at least three-quarters of
all deputies present, and two-thirds voting in favour.
NETHERLANDS
The Dutch government quietly submitted the Maastricht treaty to parliament
yesterday for ratification. 'It was just a coincidence that the treaty was
submitted today,' a Foreign Ministry spokesman said. The treaty, unlike in
several other EC countries, has attracted little critical attention in the
Netherlands. Parliament is to examine the treaty over the next few weeks but
is expected to approve it in early August.
PORTUGAL
The Foreign Ministry said Portugal, which currently holds the presidency of
the EC council of ministers, 'will evaluate with Denmark and the other EC
partners the consequences' of the Danish vote. Sources in Lisbon said there
were plans to convene a special meeting of EC foreign ministers in Oslo
today. Parliament is expected to approve the treaty in the autumn, the
country's ruling Social Democrats anticipating few problems.
SPAIN
Mr Carlos Westendorp, secretary of state for the EC, said: 'When a decision
like this occurs, something is happening or, as Shakespeare would say:
'Something is rotten in the state of Denmark'.' The Spanish parliament is
expected to approve the treaty in the autumn but, meanwhile, is waiting for
a court decision on whether the country's constitution will have to be
altered to allow foreigners to vote or to stand in local elections.
UK
Prime Minister John Major and Foreign Minister Douglas Hurd cautioned the EC
against being rattled by the Danish vote. The British government, which
takes over next month as president of the EC council of ministers, easily
won preliminary ratification of the Maastricht treaty in parliament last
month, but Mr Major yesterday postponed a further two-day debate in order to
study the implications of the Danish rejection. He rejected calls for a
referendum.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Mitterrand raises the stakes -
Referendum gamble aims to exploit divisions on Europe among France's
conservative opposition
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE Danish 'No' vote is a serious setback for the European strategy of
President Francois Mitterrand - but it is a disaster for France's
conservative opposition parties.
As the leading architect of the Maastricht treaty on European union, the
president yesterday responded to the Danish vote by raising the stakes in a
high challenge.
He promised that French ratification of the treaty would also be through a
referendum. Also, in a statement with Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany, he
reiterated their determination that ratification must go ahead as planned
this year.
Their statement confirms the driving role assumed by these two leaders since
the Maastricht negotiations started over two years ago. At their last
summit, at La Rochelle two weeks ago, they said they were determined that
Maastricht should go ahead, whatever the result of the Danish referendum,
with 11 member states, or even with 10.
Mr Mitterrand's unhesitating decision to press ahead with ratification could
turn out to be a high-risk gamble.
On balance, French public opinion is in favour of the European Community,
and recent polls suggest that more French people support than oppose the
Maastricht treaty.
But the attempt to force through ratification after it has been rejected by
Danish voters, may well agitate public opinion and intensify feelings of
anxiety about Europe which have recently appeared.
The regional elections last March revealed a huge increase in votes for
various protest parties, from the extreme right-wing National Front to the
two ecology parties and the Hunting, Shooting and Fishing party, not to
mention the rump of the Communist party.
To a greater or lesser degree, each of these can be classed as
anti-European, and together they mustered nearly 40 per cent of the vote. If
you add in the anti-European wing of the Gaullist party, and waverers in
other mainstream parties, you could reach a total which might threaten
ratification in a referendum.
But the challenges and difficulties facing Mr Mitterrand's administration
are as nothing compared with the potential political disaster now bearing
down on the conservative opposition parties.
They have long been divided on the subject of European integration, there
being the pro-Europeans in the Centrist and the UDF parties, and the
anti-Europeans in the Gaullist party. Every day, these divisions are being
jemmied wider and wider by the Maastricht debate, and the intensification of
controversy now in prospect will split them down the middle.
Last month, in the first phase of the Maastricht ratification in the
National Assembly, almost all the Centrist and UDF members voted in favour
of the necessary reform of the French Constitution - but only five Gaullists
did so, while 31 voted against and 88 abstained.
The surprising thing is that the anti-Europeans in the Gaullist party are so
passionate in their hostility to the Community, that they do not seem to
realise that the Maastricht treaty has become the central weapon in
President Mitterrand's strategy to regain political ground from his
conservative opponents.
The essential significance of Maastricht for Mr Mitterrand is its importance
in the new phase of building a more integrated Europe. There is little doubt
that the president regards this treaty as the culmination of a long
commitment to European integration, and a suitable legacy for the end of his
presidency.
But it is also a powerful instrument for waging war against his enemies,
because it searches them out where they are most divided. Yesterday, the
unconditional opponents of the Maastricht treaty, such as Mr Charles Pasqua
and Mr Pierre Mazeaud of the Gaullist party, plus the Communists and the
National Front, were all jubilant at the result of the Danish referendum,
and demanded that the French ratification be immediately stopped. Mr Jacques
Chirac, leader of the Gaullist party, who took refuge in abstention in the
National Assembly debate last month, yesterday remained silent.
By contrast, almost all the leaders of the Centrist and UDF parties insisted
categorically that the ratification must continue. The only prominent
conservative who seemed to show any awareness of the political danger ahead,
was Mr Alain Lamassoure, the UDF spokesman on Europe, who urged a meeting
between party leaders of government and opposition.
President Mitterrand cannot be sure that there is any way to ratify the
Maastricht treaty in its existing terms. Nor can he be sure that he would
secure a majority in a popular referendum, though it is likely. But if he
keeps up the process of constitutional revision and ratification, he can be
fairly sure that by the end of the process, some time in the autumn, the
conservative opposition parties will be in tatters.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Major becomes treaty's champion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS impossible yesterday to escape an awkward irony for Mr John Major in
the decision of the Danish electorate to overturn the Maastricht treaty.
The British government neither sought nor wanted a deal on closer European
integration. With a prescience rarely acknowledged at the time, Mr Douglas
Hurd, the foreign secretary, argued repeatedly that it was premature to map
out in detail the future contours of Europe. Much better to wait until the
dust settled on the collapse of socialism.
Mr Major resisted more than any other leader the federalist ambitions of
some of his European colleagues. He fought successfully for the
intergovernmental structure of the political treaty and for opt-out clauses
from economic and monetary union and from the social chapter.
From his perspective the final deal was still imperfect, ceding too much new
authority to the European Commission and to the Strasbourg parliament and
leaving too many question marks about def-ence and immigration policies.
In different circumstances Mr Major might have claimed the Danish vote as a
vindication of his opposition to the centralising tendency of the European
Commission and the more extravagant ambitions of France and Germany.
But once it had been signed, Maastricht was judged an honourable draw which
left open the future direction of the Community. Now the government believes
that it would have as much to lose as anyone if the accord were to
disintegrate.
During April's general election campaign the agreement was paraded as a
symbol of Mr Major's leadership. It was the compromise he had secured
against the odds. One that would heal the divisions over Europe in his own
party which had led to the downfall of Mrs Margaret Thatcher. A re-opening
now of negotiations with Britain's partners would threaten a parallel
resurgence of the tensions within his own party.
So Mr Major's message to the House of Commons yesterday was that Britain's
interest lay in pushing ahead with ratification of the treaty in the hope
that a formula could be found to accommodate Denmark's misgivings.
The Lisbon summit would provide the first opportunity, but failing that he
would seek to find a solution when Britain took over the presidency in the
second half of this year.
Behind the scenes, it was clear the strategy holds considerable political
risks for the prime minister.
It was one of those unhappy coincidences of politics that the Danish
electorate's decision on the treaty came on the eve of another debate on the
agreement in Britain's House of Commons.
Twice since his return from the December summit Mr Major has secured
parliamentary majorities for the deal he struck with his European partners.
But each successive debate at Westminster has been no less comfortable for
that.
The 23 Conservative MPs who last month voted against ratification of the
treaty had already planned a campaign of guerrilla warfare to wreck the
detailed scrutiny of the legislation scheduled for this week.
Yesterday the rebels were understandably jubilant when Mr Neil Kinnock, the
Labour leader, forced a postponement. The prime minister depended for his
majority in last month's debate on Labour's decision to abstain. He can no
longer be sure that the opposition will hold to that position.
There are signs too that the ranks of the Conservative dissidents may be
swelled by silent critics of the treaty who supported Mr Major last month
but who now believe he should seize the opportunity to re-open the package.
He cannot expect any help from Mrs Margaret Thatcher. By next week his
predecessor will be in the House of Lords, leading from there the call by
Euro-sceptics in all political parties for the voters in Britain to be given
the same chance to express their view as those in Denmark, Ireland and
France.
In a combative performance yesterday Mr Major bluntly rejected the notion of
a referendum in Britain, arguing that the issue had been put before the
voters in the general election.
He defended Maastricht as a step on the road to a less rather than more
centralised Europe. The intergovernmental structures which Britain had
secured could well be challenged by others in any new treaty negotiations.
The message from his colleagues was that Mr Major was determined to give a
strong lead despite the considerable risk of a much more serious rebellion
by Conservative MPs when the legislation returns to the House of Commons.
There was talk also of a silver lining. If Maastricht were salvaged, the
Danish referendum would serve as a powerful deterrent to those of Britain's
partners pressing for yet another radical shake-up of the Community's
institutions.
But Mr Major could hardly have imagined, when he fought so hard for opt-outs
from some of the key provisions of the Maastricht, that a few months later
he would be obliged to take a lead in attempts to salvage it.

THE Danish rejection of the Maastricht treaty was greeted in Germany
yesterday with horror and consternation at the consequences - both for the
European Community as a whole, and for the German debate on Europe in
particular.
Government officials seeking to guide the German ratification process
through parliament said uncertainty over the treaty could delay and
complicate the German debate.
They could see no legal way the Maastricht treaty, or parts of it, could be
approved and enacted by just 11 member states of the EC. The treaty amounts
to a substantial amendment to the Treaty of Rome, and that is bound by
Article 236 of the treaty, requiring unanimous approval by all member
states.
'Someone might get the idea that we could charge ahead with European
economic and monetary union (Emu) alone,' said one official. 'I have been
through the text again today, and there are so many references of all kinds
to Treaty of Rome institutions - the Council of Ministers, the Court of
Auditors and so on - that you cannot hope to divorce the two.
'The deeper you get into it, the more you realise what a quagmire we are
in.'
Another said: 'We are in big trouble. We have to work something out which
will allow the Danes to go back to their parliament and if need be, to the
Danish people.'
Yet Chancellor Helmut Kohl told the German cabinet yesterday that
renegotiation of the treaty was out of the question.
Political leaders from all the major parties expressed shock and sorrow at
the Danish vote, and urged that the ratification process should press ahead
regardless in the other countries, in the hope of finding some way out of
the impasse.
Mr Hans-Ulrich Klose, leader of the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) in the
Bundestag, said that it was time for 'small-minded haggling' over the
details of the European integration process to stop, and concentrate on
getting the basic guidelines in place.
To that extent, the shock of the Danish vote could help concentrate minds in
Germany, where the ratification debate has turned into a struggle for future
power between the central government and the 16 German lander (states). The
two sides are still locked in negotiations about constitutional amendments
to give the states an effective veto on future transfers of sovereignty to
Brussels.
The underlying fear in the political establishment is that the confusion
will stoke growing German doubts about the wisdom of pressing ahead with Emu
and allowing the Deutsche Mark to be subsumed into a single European
currency. Although those popular fears are scarcely represented in Bonn,
they have been a factor in the drift from mainstream political parties to
right and left in recent local elections.
'One factor in the Danish vote was a general disappointment with the
politicians,' a senior official said. 'It was the people who rejected the
politicians. This is typical of other countries in the Community - including
Germany.'
The official line is clear.
'Now it's up to us,' said Mr Dieter Vogel, the government spokesman, summing
up a joint statement by Chancellor Helmut Kohl and President Francois
Mitterrand. The two leaders expressed their determination 'to realise
European union consistently and without wavering,' calling on other member
states to ensure ratification by the end of the year.
However the German government's draft law on ratification has still not been
presented to the cabinet, because of the negotiations with the 16 states. Mr
Vogel said yesterday that differences remain. At the heart of the debate is
the extent to which the government will give away effective control over
future foreign policy to the states.
The 16 states have the power to block ratification of the treaty if they do
not get their way. The German constitution must be amended, and that means
winning a two-thirds majority in the upper house, the Bundesrat, where the
states are represented. Hence the need to do a deal.
'The Danish vote certainly changes things,' says one political adviser. 'We
are negotiating with the prime ministers about some very fundamental changes
in the structure of the state. Some people may argue now that if Maastricht
is in doubt, why should we go so far to change our constitution.'

THE Irish government yesterday confirmed that the country's referendum on
the Maastricht treaty would go ahead as planned on June 18.
Mr Albert Reynolds, prime minister, called for a 'redoubling' of efforts to
secure a 'yes' vote, warning: 'The attention of Europe will be on us.'
He said that the crisis over the treaty was 'a Danish problem', but it was
clear that the government fears Ireland would lose by a collapse of the
treaty.
Ministers are hopeful that a mechanism for going ahead with most of its
proposals will be found, without Denmark if necessary. 'Clearly our partners
are not going to abandon the treaty,' Mr Reynolds said.
Although there appears to be no more than a sizeable minority in Ireland
against the treaty, the cabinet, which met yesterday, is concerned that a
postponement of the referendum would send the wrong signals.
However, Mr Bertie Ahern, finance minister, acknowledged that the Danish
'no' vote would 'liven up' the Irish debate, which has also become embroiled
in a row over the country's abortion laws.
Speaking in parliament, Mr Reynolds expressed 'deep regret' at the Danish
result and warned that the financial impact on that country, including
higher interest rates and a withdrawal of investment funds, could be felt in
Ireland if it also voted 'no'.
The prime minister added: 'A 'no' vote does have serious economic
consequences, even for a more highly developed economy than our own. Our
essential national interests have not changed overnight because of the
Danish result.'
Ireland stands to receive cohesion funds worth about IPounds 6bn (Pounds
5.45bn) over five years through the Maastricht treaty. Ministers are anxious
that negotiations on the funds continue.
Mr Reynolds said he could not over-emphasise how a resounding 'yes' would
enhance Ireland's standing in Europe and its negotiating position.
'The European union treaty, and our full participation in it, will provide
major benefits for us, such as a boost to economic growth, more jobs,
narrowing of disparities in living standards, improvements in workers' and
womens' rights, protection of the environment, as well as a strengthening
the community's role as a core of stability in Europe.'
Mr John Bruton, leader of the opposition Fine Gael party, backed the
decision to go ahead with the June 18 poll and said that a re-negotiation of
Maastricht would be unlikely to work to Ireland's advantage.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Berlin to keep disputed properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERLIN'S city government said yesterday it would take over more than DM10bn
(Pounds 3.4bn) worth of properties in east Berlin, instead of allowing their
former owners to claim them.
Mr Steffen Kammradt, spokesman of the Berlin Finance Office, said the
decision, taken on Tuesday night, would end the deadlock in rebuilding east
Berlin, caused by rival property claims. The ruling is expected to be
legally challenged by former owners.
The decision runs counter to a previous recommendation by the German
government that the properties, which were confiscated by occupying Soviet
forces shortly after East Germany was established in October 1949, should be
returned to their previous owners.
Mr Kammradt estimated that 'considerably more' than DM10bn worth of property
would be affected.
Among the most valuable real estate to revert to the city is a sprawling
site on Leipziger Platz, which had belonged to the Jewish-owned Wertheim
department store chain, now part of the Hertie group.
Prime sites owned by the Hohenzollern family, descendants of the former
emperor of Germany, were also affected by the decision.
A total of 589 companies and 951 property sites, mainly in the inner-city
Mitte district, is being claimed by the city, although it represents only a
small proportion of all buildings that might be subject to claims by former
owners.
Mr Kammradt said city-owned property could now be developed by investors who
might include some of the former owners.
It was up to the Bonn government to decide whether restitution would be paid
to former Jewish owners, their heirs or the Jewish Claims Commission, he
said.
Under the German unification treaty, three categories were excluded from
claims made by former owners: property confiscated from former Nazi
activists, from war criminals and from buyers of property owned by Jews
forced to sell in the 1930s.
Berlin's government said it had approved the merger of three state-owned
banks, creating one of Germany's top 10 financial institutions, Reuter
reports from Berlin.
The Berlin state government said the city's coalition of Christian Democrats
and the Social Democrats had approved the merger of Berliner Bank,
Landesbank Berlin and Pfandbrief-Kreditanstalt.
The new company will be called the Berliner Banken Holding AG and will start
operations in 1994. Approval clears the way for the city to draft a law to
put the three institutions under one roof.
'It will now be possible to finance large projects in Berlin,' said Mayor
Eberhard Diepgen.

<TEXT>
MR Andrei Kokoshin, recently appointed Russian deputy defence minister,
yesterday warned Ukraine that Russia saw itself as the successor to the
Soviet Union in the observance and signature of nuclear weapons treaties. It
would also become the only possessor of nuclear weapons among the former
Soviet states.
Only Russia, he said, could negotiate further reductions of nuclear weapons
with the US and other nuclear states. Asked if he thought the US shared this
view, Mr Kokoshin, the first civilian in such a senior post, said: 'I hope
so.'
The issue has been complicated by the statement by Mr Leonid Kravchuk,
Ukrainian president, that the US was willing for all four former Soviet
states with nuclear weapons on their territory - Russia, Ukraine, Belarus
and Kazakhstan - to sign the Start treaty on strategic arms reduction. Mr
Sergei Yastrzhembsky, Russian foreign ministry spokesman, said yesterday
that he was 'unaware' of such an agreement.
The dispute among the former Soviet states is delaying signature of the
Start treaty and the beginning of talks on a Start II agreement, which Mr
Kokoshin said he was anxious to get under way. 'The participation of Ukraine
in the Start process would mean that (it) would be regarded as a nuclear
state - and that violates the Nuclear Proliferation Treaty, which it says it
wishes to sign,' he said.
A Start II treaty should see much bigger cuts agreed between Russia and the
US, he said - as well as between Russia and other nuclear-armed states, such
as France and the UK. Mr Kokoshin said the principles of a defence doctrine
would be ready in a matter of weeks.
He said that a future army of the Commonwealth of Independent States would
be 'mixed' in composition.
'There will be a Russian army in Russia; there may be Russian troops in
other CIS republics; there will be agreements with other CIS armies. We will
probably have a basic framework of security, and within that we will have
bilateral and trilateral agreements on such matters as bases, stockpiles and
training.'
He says states which wished nuclear cover could have it provided by Russia -
'though they might have agreements with other nuclear states as well'.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NATO foreign ministers are meeting in Oslo to discuss a wider European
peacekeeping role for the alliance in the knowledge that the crisis in the
European Community, brought about by Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht
treaty, can only enhance Nato's position as Europe's principal security
organisation.
The extent to which future European defence arrangements should be linked to
Nato or the European Community was already the subject of dispute between
France and Britain and though nothing can prevent the EC member countries
from pursuing their original aim, under Maastricht, of turning the
nine-nation Western European Union into a more effective instrument for
their own defence, the absence of an international treaty framework could
hamper the process.
Any relief at the new lease of life given to the alliance will not, however,
make it easier for Nato foreign ministers to reach agreement on a wider
peacekeeping role. No-one wants Nato to become 'a pan-European policeman,'
as Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, put it this week. But the
US, Britain and some other European allies want it to answer specific
requests to carry out peace-keeping activities by international
organisations such as the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
(CSCE) and the United Nations.
In sharp contrast to the US, which would like the European members to make a
new commitment to Nato to justify the administration's policy of maintaining
a military foothold in Europe, France wants any peace-keeping requests to be
made to individual member nations and not to Nato as an organisation.
Nato foreign ministers are also due to sign a new arms-control document,
together with representatives from the Commonwealth of Independent States,
under which the CIS states, individually, will undertake to carry out the
arms cuts agreed on by the former Soviet Union when it signed the
conventional forces in Europe (CFE) treaty in Paris at the end of 1990.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOUR candidates are being considered for what must be one of the most
uncomfortable seats at the top in Russia: the post of central bank chairman.
The choice is likely to be made within the next two weeks.
Mr Alexander Pochinok, chairman of the parliamentary commission which will
examine the candidates, said yesterday the four were Mr Viktor Gerashchenko,
the former chairman of the Soviet central bank; one of his deputies, Mr
Valerian Kulikov; Mr Boris Fyodorov, the radical former Russian finance
minister; and Mr Yakov Dubinetsky, chairman of one of Russia's state-owned
banks, Promstroibank.
His revelations came as Mr Gyorgy Matiukhin, the thick-skinned central bank
chairman who announced he was quitting on Monday, angrily accused parliament
of looking for 'somebody who would bow either to the president or the
parliamentary speaker'.
'I'm not that kind of man,' he said in an angry defence of his record in
parliament yeshe ascribed in part to 'shattered nerves', came just as the
government had come to accept him as the lesser of possible evils for his
stubborn defence of a relatively strict monetary policy.
The key job has become vacant at a critical time for the future course of
market reforms launched in January by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy
prime minister.
Six months on, it is not clear how hard either President Yeltsin or Mr
Gaidar - having given up so much ground to opponents of radical reform  -
will fight for a candidate of their choice.
Even when the job was not vacant, the government had been pushing for Mr
Fyodorov, who is now working for the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development in London, to take the job.
Mr Fyodorov, who resigned from an earlier Yeltsin administration, in
December 1990, on the grounds that the Russian leader was not serious about
market reforms, was also rumoured in the corridors of parliament yesterday
to be President Yeltsin's favourite.
But Mr Pochinok appeared yesterday to damn him with faint praise. 'Fyodorov
is part of a new wave, very talented, but with less experience. He lacks
contacts inside the country and is somewhat withdrawn from domestic
affairs,' he said last night. Mr Fyodorov will be pressing for full
independence to run a tight financial policy - which may not go down well
with parliament despite its claims that all it wants is 'more information'.
Mr Pochinok praised Mr Gerashchenko, for his international and domestic
stature, but said he had the disadvantage of being burdened by his past as
Soviet central bank chairman (including alleged support for the August coup)
 -unlike his deputy, Mr Kulikov.
The World Bank has agreed a Dollars 400m (Pounds 222m) loan to Romania to
help the country restructure its economy and continue with reforms, the
Romanian government said yesterday, writes Virginia Marsh in Bucharest.
Japan also intends to lend a further Dollars 100m to Dollars 150m, it said.

THE Ukrainian National Bank plans from July 1 to end government guarantees
on enterprises' payments from creditors, in a major step forward in
piecemeal efforts at market reform.
The move, which is scheduled to coincide with Ukraine's new law on
bankruptcy, is backed by parliament.
It comes as part of an effort being made by Mr Vadim Hetman, the tough new
head of the Ukrainian National Bank, to end a practice which has allowed
Ukrainian enterprises to rack up a Rouble546bn internal debt.
Under the current system, when purchasers do not pay, sellers are
compensated with credit issued by the National Bank.
Moreover, according to Mr Hetman, Russian enterprises have amassed a one
trillion-rouble debt to Ukrainian enterprises, although other government
officials concede that the size of the debt between Ukraine and Russia
depends on whether it is calculated in 1991 or 1992 prices.
At the most recent meeting of the leaders of the members of the Commonwealth
of Independent States, Ukraine pressed for an assessment and settlement of
inter-republican enterprise debt, but the proposal was rebuffed by Russia.
Mr Hetman said that debts between Ukrainian enterprises and debts between
Ukraine and all CIS republics, with the exception of Russia, will be
calculated at a meeting on June 11 and 12.

SERB irregulars yesterday again ambushed a van carrying medical supplies
into the besieged capital of Sarajevo, capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, as
United Nations officials started negotiations aimed at reopening the city's
airport.
A medical assistant was shot dead after a hail of anti-aircraft machine-gun
fire sprayed the vehicle which was marked with the Red Cross symbol.
Mr Zoran Pirovic, a journalist at Sarajevo radio, said the 'gunmen do not
respect any symbols. It is the same story every day. More fighting, more
killing, and increased hunger for the people of Sarajevo.'
Serb militia and the Yugoslav federal army have been blocking the airport
for two months in order to starve the city into submission.
UN officials yesterday said the sticking point on agreement to reopen the
airport was a dispute over which forces should control it. 'There is no
point in lifting the blockade if people cannot travel freely to and from the
airport,' a UN official said.
UN officials said this would require a considerable UN peace-keeping force.
The Bosnian newsagency yesterday reported that the UN was planning to deploy
a contingent of 1,000 French peace-keeping troops to protect the airport. A
UN official said this 'could be true'. French officials have visited
Sarajevo to consider such an option.
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic said in a British television interview
yesterday that he was ready to resign if that would bring an end to UN
sanctions on Serbia and Montenegro, Reuter reports.

EUROPEAN Community leaders vowed to press ahead with ratification of the
Maastricht treaty yesterday, in shocked but determined response to the 'No'
vote in the Danish referendum on Tuesday.
Although heads of government expressed their determination to see the
process of ratification completed by the end of the year, they were still
trying to fathom the legal implication for a treaty which requires
ratification by all 12 member states.
'We are in big trouble,' a senior German official said. 'It will take very
careful and skilful management to get Maastricht adopted,' added a
Commission offical.
The next steps will become clearer today when Nato foreign ministers meet in
Oslo where they will hear Denmark's proposals on how to break the impasse.
President Francois Mitterrand announced that France would continue with the
ratification process but would submit it to popular referendum.
The announcement was evidently precipitated by the Danish vote, although
most observers have long expected Mr Mitterrand to hold a referendum in the
autumn.
Mr John Major also pledged to press ahead with ratification, but ruled a
referendum.
Other EC leaders took a tough position on the Danish vote. Mr Joao de Deus
Pinheiro, the foreign minister of Portugal which currently holds the EC
presidency, said: 'There is strong unanimity that the Eleven should go
ahead, without any hesitation, to fulfil the (Maastricht) obligations.'
He insisted that there was 'no room for renegotiating' the treaty which took
over a year to finalise. He added: 'One cannot imagine that a country which
does not share the fundamental objectives of the Community can continue to
be a member state.'
Mr Jacques Delors, EC president, speaking after an emergency session of the
European Commission, called for other member states to ratify Maastricht by
the end of this year.
The Danish vote, Mr Delors warned, would have 'consequences, not only for
the Community itself, but for Denmark and the Danes, and also for the
prospects of enlarging the Community'.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the Bank of England, said the Danish
vote might delay the movement towards economic and monetary union, but that
'we will probably get there'.
Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of Banque de France, said the outcome
meant that EC members had to 'go more quickly to ratification of Emu'. Mr
Helmut Schlesinger, president of the Bundesbank, said work on moving towards
monetary union by the central bank governors would continue.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl said renegotiation of the treaty was out of the
question, and insisted that Germany and the rest of the EC should pursue
ratification.
In a joint statement, he and Mr Mitterrand declared their determination to
press ahead towards European union.
Senior German officials admitted, however, that they could see no way to
pass the treaty into EC law without the approval of all 12 member states.
'This amounts to an amendment of the Treaty of Rome, and it is bound by
Article 236. That means unanimity,' one diplomat said. 'There is no way
round it. We need to work out something which will allow the Danes to go
back to their parliament, and if need be, to the Danish people.
'We cannot play around with the text of Maastricht. If we do that, we open
up a Pandora's box. If we don't, we still have to try to accommodate
Denmark, which seems impossible without a thorough re-examination of the
text. It is Catch 22.'
Germany's ratification process is bogged down in negotiations between the
central government and the 16 federal states, which are demanding an equal
say on any further transfer of sovereignty to the EC.
Denmark called for an extraordinary meeting of EC foreign ministers to
consider the consequences of the Danish rejection. Mr Poul Schluter, the
prime minister, will fly to Lisbon today to explain Denmark's position to
the Portuguese government.
Mr Schluter said that, in spite of the vote against Maastricht, an
overwhelming majority of the people wanted to continue EC membership.
In addition to today's emergency session of EC foreign ministers, it is also
possible that the Lisbon summit, scheduled for June 26-27, will be held
earlier.
The overriding challenge for EC leaders is to seek a legal framework which
can both keep Denmark in the Community and save the Maastricht treaty.
One extraordinary option being mooted is for the Twelve formally to renounce
the Treaty of Rome, whose substance Denmark's 11 partners would convert into
a new treaty amended by Maastricht. This would leave Denmark sharing most of
this new European union constitution with the others, but leave it -
strictly speaking - as the only remaining member of the EC.

MR JOHN MAJOR pledged to press ahead with ratification of the Maastricht
treaty yesterday despite signs that Denmark's vote against further European
integration could spark a large-scale rebellion by Tory MPs.
As the government sought to grapple with the vote's implications, several
ministers were said last night privately to be backing calls for a
renegotiation of the accord on political and economic union.
The prime minister flatly rejected calls from Conservative and Labour
Euro-sceptics for a British referendum on the agreement.
In an uncompromising performance in the House of Commons, Mr Major insisted
that the deal negotiated at Maastricht was in the best interests of Britain
and the European Community.
But there were signs at Westminster that the ranks of the two dozen or so
Conservative rebels who have consistently opposed the agreement were being
swelled by others demanding a fundamental reappraisal of the government's
stance.
Up to 100 Tory MPs were said to have signed a motion expressing unease about
the pace of European integration. Some ministers shared the glee of the
Euro-sceptics at the blow Denmark had dealt to Brussels.
Mrs Margaret Thatcher, whose antipathy towards the Community was at the
heart of her downfall two years ago, hailed the result of the Danish
referendum as a triumph for democracy. Confidants of the former prime
minister said she might lead the campaign for a referendum after her
expected elevation to the House of Lords in the dissolution honours later
this week.
But her stance was sharply criticised by Mr Helmut Kohl, the German
chancellor. Writing in The European newspaper, he described her opposition
to integration as 'obsolete'.
Senior opposition figures indicated that Labour may now consider backing
calls from the Conservative rebels for a referendum. If that shift were
confirmed, Mr Major would face a serious risk of defeat in the House of
Commons.
The Danish decision forced the government to postpone - probably for two or
three weeks - a debate on the legislation needed to ratify Maastricht
scheduled for yesterday and today.
Mr Major said Britain could lose more than it might gain by any general
renegotiation of the accord, with some EC governments seeking to reopen the
argument about federalism. Last night he drew comfort from the choice of Sir
Peter Hordern, a close ally, as chairman of the backbench committee on
Europe of Conservative MPs.
The prime minister insisted that the structure of the treaty - based to a
large extent on inter-governmental co-operation - had marked a reversal of
the trend towards centralisation in the EC.
Responding to calls from Conservative opponents of the deal, he replied:
'The treaty itself has not changed, and neither has my view of the treaty.'

FT  04 JUN 92 / Lloyd's losses for 1989 may exceed Pounds 2bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at Lloyd's of London for 1989 are likely to exceed Pounds 2bn,
according to the latest forecast by Chatset, the company which analyses the
insurance market.
The result will 'exceed most people's worst expectations', said Chatset,
which had estimated a loss of Pounds 1.35bn as recently as January.
In line with its three-year accounting system, Lloyd's will report its 1989
results later this month. Chatset's forecast is based on final figures for
the large majority of the 401 syndicates which traded at the market in 1989.
The bad news was underlined yesterday when Sturge Holdings, the biggest
agency group at Lloyd's, cut its interim dividend by 50 per cent and gave a
more downbeat assessment of the performance of its syndicates in the 1990
year.
Sturge, which like Lloyd's is chaired by Mr David Coleridge, said it would
'take longer than expected for profits to return to their previous levels'.
It owns agencies which manage syndicates and handle the affairs of Names,
the individuals whose assets back underwriting at Lloyd's. Sturge's shares
fell 35 per cent yesterday to close 59p lower at 111p.
Chatset said a minority of syndicates specialising in so-called 'spiral'
business - in which syndicates and companies reinsure each other's
catastrophe exposures - will bear the brunt of the 1989 loss.
Syndicates managed by agencies such as Gooda Walker and Feltrim were
overwhelmed by a series of catastrophe losses - such as hurricane Hugo  -
towards the end of 1989.
Other syndicates have been hit by US claims where insurers are meeting the
cost of cleaning up polluted sites and removing asbestos from buildings.
Mr John Rew, co-editor of Chatset's reports and himself a Lloyd's Name
facing heavy losses, predicted that losses in 1990 and 1991 could force many
Names out of the market and reduce the capital base from its present level
of Pounds 10.1bn to as little as Pounds 4bn by 1995.
He said the bail-out plan for Lloyd's Names facing the most severe losses
and currently being examined by Lloyd's would not solve the market's
problems and that tax breaks and credit lines may be necessary to secure its
future. Lloyd's announced it was investigating a bail-out scheme in April
and one may be announced at the society's annual general meeting on June 24.
Although Lloyd's is not challenging the Chatset forecasts, senior figures on
the market take issue with long-term projections.
Mr Paul Archard, chairman of the Lloyd's Underwriting Agents' Association,
which represents more than 100 Lloyd's agents, said 'the long-term
projections are absolutely wrong'.
Pointing to rising insurance rates and the number of Names joining Lloyd's
through his own Murray Lawrence agency, Mr Archard said Chatset was 'in
cloud cuckoo land'.
Mr Rew said Lloyd's was attempting to 'gull investors'. He said: 'Hindsight
shows that to have been optimistic about Lloyd's has been misplaced.'

FT  04 JUN 92 / German currency boosted by disarray in markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FINANCIAL MARKETS across Europe were thrown into disarray yesterday after
Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht treaty.
The D-Mark was virtually the only beneficiary of the turmoil as the German
currency reasserted its role as the anchor of the European Monetary System.
European government bond markets suffered especially big losses as investors
reasoned that prospects for convergence for inflation and interest rates
across Europe had been diminished.
As dealers sold other European currencies for the D-Mark, the German
currency rose sharply benefiting from the Bundesbank's reputation for
keeping down inflation. Sterling, the French franc and the Italian lira
suffered the worst losses.
In government bond markets, high-yielding securities such as stock issued by
the Italian and Spanish governments were among the hardest hit. Ecu bonds
fell by 1.5 points, while UK gilt-edged securities finished 1 point lower.
Sterling lost two pfennings in London to close at DM2.9150. It moved below
the lira to finish second from the bottom of the European Monetary System
grid, above the Danish krone.
The Bank of Portugal was forced to intervene in the markets after it
appeared that the Danish currency, the weakest currency in the EMS, might
fall below its permitted lower limit. The bank sold escudos, the strongest
currency in the system, for D-Marks in a technical manoeuvre to ease strains
within the grid. This was the first such intervention by an EMS central bank
in four months.
The Danish authorities raised money market rates by 0.65 points to slow the
krone's descent. Denmark's currency closed at around DKr3.8650 against the
D-Mark, after trading at around DKr3.840 on Tuesday.
In New York, trading on currency markets was subdued as traders and
investors struggled with the implications of the Danish vote. The D-Mark
remained the currency of choice. Consequently, the dollar fell slightly to
DM1.6035 but appreciated against the other European currencies.
European stock markets fell after France announced it was to call its own
referendum on the treaty. The Paris bourse was hit hard, with shares falling
1.6 per cent on the day.
In London, the FT-SE 100 index dropped 25.0 to close at 2,680.9.

FT  04 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Early confidence upset as futures
fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CLOUD cast over prospects for the Maastricht Treaty by developments in
Denmark and France unsettled the London stock market yesterday. Stock index
futures plunged heavily, closing at a discount to the underlying stock
market for the first time in this account as traders took alarm at a setback
in UK government bonds which raised worries regarding the British
government's funding schedule. The FT-SE Index, edging ahead at mid-session,
lost 30 points in the afternoon before steadying at the close of business.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,680.9 for a net loss of 25
points.
While yesterday's setback in equities was little more than a nervous
response to developments in Europe, market strategists warned of potentially
more serious implications. Yield ratios between UK equities and gilts could
be sharply changed if anti-Maastricht moves upset potential overseas buyers
of UK government bonds. 'The gilt market needs to be closely watched over
the next week,' warned the economics team at Kleinwort Benson Securities.
London rallied comfortably at first from an initial fall of 10.9 on the
Footsie which reflected the overnight news that the Danish referendum had
rejected Maastricht; nor was the UK market long restrained by Wall Street's
weak close overnight.
By midday, traders' thoughts were turning towards the Epsom racecourse and
bets were being placed for the Derby, always the stock market's favourite
horse race. The mood changed dramatically, however, when the Paris bond
market plunged on news that France will hold a referendum on the European
unity treaty, and UK gilts followed suit. A sharp setback in the sterling
rate against the D-mark completed the London stock market's unhappiness.
As so often happens, it was the stock index futures market which took the
brunt of the selling pressure, attracting significant unloading of positions
by marketmakers and institutions struggling to shift their investment
stances. The June index future quickly fell to a discount and prices for the
underlying equity stocks were struck down in haste as marketmakers sought to
minimise losses.
Turnover in equities was relatively unexciting with a Seaq total of 473.6m
shares comparing with 493.8m in the previous session. There were a number of
good company news features and the banking sector turned firmer as traders
absorbed the implications for the sector of the growing struggle for control
of Midland.
However, the general nervousness unsettled the broad range of the market.
Pharmaceutical stocks remained depressed by the bearish trend established on
Wall Street, but steadied at the close when the New York market rallied from
initial loss to make a firm start to the new session.
There was no move by market firms yesterday to alter their forecasts for the
London market. The consensus view remained that recovery stocks should be
bought, although it was agreed that unambiguous confirmation of an economic
recovery is still lacking.

THE ANNOUNCEMENT that the French Government is to hold a referendum on the
Maastricht treaty caused a sharp retreat in the FT-SE future sending it to a
discount to the cash market on several occasions during the session, writes
Joel Kibazo.
An early fall in the June contract on the FT-SE, after it opened at 2,708,
quickly gave way to a squeeze which sent the contract climbing to 2,724 by
about 11am.
However, the mid-session announcement from Paris led to a large sell-off
causing June to tumble as it gave up earlier gains. At several points during
the afternoon, June was at a discount to the cash market, though a further
slide was halted by early firmness on Wall Street. The confidence on Wall
Street proved unsustainable and June drifted back again.
June closed at 2,680, down 37 on the previous session and below its
estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover was high, more
than 14,000 contracts were dealt.
The day in traded options was reported to have lacked big features. A total
of 28,739 lots were traded, of which the FT-SE option traded 10,136. Bid
target Midland Bank, once again took the honours for the most traded stock
option as some 2,648 lots changed hands. This was followed by National Power
at 2,413 lots.

BOURSES which had appeared in the morning to shrug off Denmark's surprise
'No' vote against the Maastrict treaty changed their minds after France
called its own referendum on European political and economic union, writes
Our Markets Staff.
Ironically, Copenhagen apart, Paris had the worst experience of the day.
Frankfurt moved from indifference, through cautious concern just before the
official close to further losses in blue chips after hours, but there were
signs there of a recovery in the late afternoon.
PARIS began to weaken immediately the market opened with the fall
accelerating after President Mitterrand's announcement. Having spent much of
the morning resisting a descent through the 2,000 barrier, the index sped to
an intraday low of 1,976 before staging a slight recovery just before the
close. The CAC-40 ended down 32.26 or 1.6 per cent at 1,992.61 in volume of
FFr2.55bn.
The financial sector was hit as the franc came under pressure in the
currency markets, Paribas falling FFr12.90 to FFr401.6 and Societe Generale
by FFr21.00 to FFr520.00.
Other news had its effect. Eurotunnel, weak recently, with some analysts
commenting that investors may have felt that, on technical grounds, the
price had now fallen as far as it was likely.
Promodes tumbled FFr169.00 to FFr3,430 on Tuesday's expectation of 12 per
cent growth this year, which has led to a number of forecast revisions ahead
of tomorrow's analysts' meeting.
Peugeot lost FFr12.00 to FFr777.00 after disappointing sales figures earlier
in the week, while dealing in Dassault Electronique was suspended at
FFr180.00 ahead of a restructuring announcement after the close.
Among oils Total lost FFr5.60 to FFr258.40 and Elf shed FFr6.60 to
FFr392.40.
FRANKFURT moved from a 0.84 rise to 719.06 in the FAZ at midsession to a
12.81 fall to 1,788.58 in the DAX at the close. Turnover rose from DM5.9bn
to DM6.9bn.
Mr Horst Greven of Merck Finck in Dusseldorf said that blue chips lost a lot
of ground in the last half hour of official trading, suggesting protective
mark-downs by dealers.
The relationship between equities and futures in the afternoon indicated
another 5 points off the DAX in the post-bourse, said Mr Greven, but at the
end of it equities seemed to be gaining ground again.
Drug, or drug-associated companies were down again, Schering dropping
DM31.50 to DM755 after a DM6.80 fall on Tuesday on government proposals for
a two-year freeze on pharmaceuticals prices. Gehe, the leading drug
wholesaler, dropped DM45 to DM919; Altana and Bayer, both with important
pharmaceuticals arms, fell DM22.50 to DM623.50, and DM4.80 to DM290.
MILAN recouped some of the opening losses triggered by the Danish vote, the
Comit index closing 2.99 lower at 497.32. Fiat and Montedison, which both
lost ground at the official closings, rebounded in later kerb trading to end
L68 better at L5,474 and just L3 lower at L1,500 respectively.
Banks were hit harder, Banco di Roma and Credito Italiano lost more than 2
per cent with Mediobanca and San Paolo down by slightly less than 1 per
cent.
A number of bourses fell by a reactive 1 per cent or less. ZURICH's SMI
index of leading shares fell 14.4 to 1,915.8. Dealers blamed the French
referendum move, but they also said that Swiss chemical stocks also followed
Tuesday's Wall Street weakness in chemicals.
AMSTERDAM saw Fokker actively traded on rumours that merger talks with Dasa
may be in trouble. The aircraft manufacturer lost Fl 1.20 to Fl 34.30, while
the CBS Tendency General index declined 0.9 to 130.2.
STOCKHOLM opened 1.3 per cent lower, but recovered steadily to end at its
high for the day as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 8.30 down at
983.90.
VIENNA recovered from early loses. The ATX index closed 4.84 up at 1,006.93,
its highest level since the beginning of April. Among the most active stocks
OMV rose Sch16 to Sch938 on news that it had made a new discovery of oil in
Libya. The textile manufacturer, Lenzing, gained Sch2 to Sch1,030 in spite
of announcing a 38 per cent fall in 1991 operating profit.
DANISH equities opened the day 8 eight per cent down after yesterday's
referendum rejecting the Maastricht treaty, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
Prices recovered steadily in heavy trading throughout most of the day, but
an hour before the official close the computerised trade registration system
broke down and brought business to a halt.  The market was taken by surprise
by the referendum result. Few brokers had taken the possibility of a 'No'
vote seriously, especially after late opinion polls had pointed to a
majority in favour.
The KFX index slipped in early trading to 94,330, a fall of about 6 per
cent, but when trading halted it was back to 96,100, a fall of 4.1 per cent
on the day. The all-share index crashed by 12.60 to 335.13, down 3.6 per
cent. Turnover was DKr412m, almost twice the daily turnover in recent weeks.

FT  04 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Buenos Aires peaks after avalanche of
new money - The return of flight capital has led to a snowball effect in
Argentine equities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
May was a month of records for the Buenos Aires stock exchange and June will
probably be equally memorable.
Trading volume broke records on three successive days last month, hitting a
peak of Dollars 131m on May 21. The exchange's Merval index, which tracks 16
blue chip stocks, rose 6.2 per cent in dollar terms in May to reach a record
high of 882, more than four times its level 12 months earlier. The market
has consolidated since then, but it still managed to chalk up a new record
turnover figure of Dollars 147m on Tuesday when the Merval closed at 870.
Buenos Aires became one of the world's best-performing markets after it was
hit last year by an avalanche of money, which has kept pushing up prices
ever since. For a market with only 170 stocks and daily turnover of just
Dollars 3m only 18 months ago, the change has been impressive.
The bull phase has turned into a snowball effect: the influx of money pushes
up the index, attracting more money, forcing the index inexorably upwards.
Last month, over Dollars 855m entered Argentina, nearly all of it flight
capital returning to the country, fleeing low international interest rates.
Argentina's markets blasted off in August, when it became clear that
restructuring of the Dollars 32bn foreign commercial bank debt under the
auspices of the Brady plan would be successful. A convertible currency
pegged to the US dollar, unwavering government commitment to economic reform
and low inflation further strengthened confidence. Most listed companies
moved strongly into profit after a severe recession ended in mid-1991.
At first, investors bought tried and trusted blue chips to win exposure to
Argentina. When blue chips became fully priced, they branched into
second-tier stocks, which have also reached saturation point. The markets
really came into their own with the sale in December and March of the
government's 30 per cent stakes in two privatised telephone companies for
over Dollars 2bn, with the new equity feeding investors' appetites.
Now, after aggressive government promotion of equity markets, new companies
are applying for listings. This is important for two reasons. First, without
more supply, there is every chance that the equity snowball will go into
metamorphosis and turn into a giant bubble. El Economista, a financial
weekly, calculates that the market's 12 largest companies already have a
historical price/earnings ratio of 43, although their aggregate profits were
very low in 1991.
Second, incursions into the equity market demonstrate an important shift in
Argentina's stuffy corporate culture. Nearly all companies are family-owned,
and their proprietors fear that selling shares to outsiders would become a
thin edge of a wedge that would eventually force them to relinquish control.
But the lure of dirt cheap equity capital is overcoming these fears.
Guillermo Decker, a construction goods company, was the first to hit the
market in May with a Dollars 14m offer representing 22 per cent of its
equity. Companies in the pipeline include Sevel, Argentina's biggest car
assembler, which builds Fiat and Peugeot cars under licence, and two
affiliates of the Bunge y Born group. Yet more privatisation stocks are due
this year.
Equities will remain buoyant for as long as the virtuous circle of capital
inflows and new share issues keeps going. And if corporate profits continue
growing, today's apparently absurd share prices will be justified.
Furthermore, private pension funds are to make their first appearance next
year and should channel a good part of their Dollars 6-7bn annual cash flow
into equities.
But the market is vulnerable to an unpredictable shift in investor
sentiment, say cautionary voices. This could suddenly turn the virtuous
circle vicious, sending prices crashing and flight capital winging its way
back to Miami bank accounts as quickly as it left.

short of commitment

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices posted moderate gains on short-term trading of theme stocks,
but overall activity remained subdued, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average advanced 68.13 to 18,188.68 after a high of 18,316.94 and
a low of 18,118.43 reflecting short-term trading by dealers and individuals,
and index-linked trading by arbitrageurs.
Volume rose slightly from 230m shares to 250m. Declines led advances by 453
to 429 with 203 unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks edged
up 1.80 to 1,366.38 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei eased 2.03 to 1080.65.
Domestic fund managers said that although the corporate results season was
over, they were reluctant to commit funds due to the uncertainty surrounding
the future course of the Japanese economy.
Theme stock trading dominated activity. Nippon Mining, bought for its Aids
research, was the most active issue of the day, gaining Y1 to Y485. Snow
Brand Milk Products gained Y42 to Y782 on reports that it had started
clinical testing of an Alzheimer cure in the US.
Mazda Motor, which previously advanced on the environmental theme due to
reports of its development of a recyclable plastic, lost Y26 to Y495 on
profit-taking. However, Japan Storage Battery, the supplier for battery-run
cars, gained strength with a rise of Y50 to Y1,100.
Other speculative favourites were also active, with Isetan, the department
store, up Y80 to Y2,260 and Nihon Nohyaku, the agrochemical maker, adding
Y20 to Y1,240.
Foreign investors sought Sony, which gained Y100 to Y4,390. Despite the
strength of the yen against the dollar, high-technology issues with high
export ratios were firmer on bargain-hunting. Toshiba advanced Y5 to Y645
and Fujitsu by Y14 to Y665.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 10.72 to 20,822.28 in volume of 17.9m shares.
Ono Pharmaceutical rose Y180 to Y6,600 on the bio-technology theme.
Roundup
Many of the region's markets gained momentum following the decision by the
US president to grant China Most Favoured Nation trade status for another
year.
HONG KONG fell back on profit-taking. The Hang Seng index closed 22.02 lower
at 6,037.37 in turnover down to HKDollars 3.83bn from HKDollars 4.32bn.
HSBC initially lost HKDollars 1 to HKDollars 47.50 following its upwardly
revised offer for Midland. However, it closed down 75 cents at HKDollars
47.75.
SEOUL gained slightly on support from the stabilisation fund. The composite
stock index closed 1.64 higher at 568.98 in turnover of Won218.4bn.
Oil stocks improved on expectations that the government will raise petrol
prices. Yukong rose by Won500 to Won24,200.
TAIWAN rose on a technical rebound. The weighted index advanced 115.03 to
4,583.97 in turnover of TDollars 28.2bn.
The financial sector rose 4 per cent on rumours that the government would
soon allow an expansion of banking ties with China.
MANILA continued to be strong following the recent presidential elections.
The composite index closed up 33.70 to 1,439.42 after an intraday high of
1,445.37. Combined turnover was 450m pesos.
AUSTRALIA again focused on Foster's Brewing and the All Ordinaries index
closed up 1.8 at 1,678.1 in turnover of ADollars 216m.
Foster's reached an intraday high of ADollars 2.11 before declining slightly
to close up 8 cents at ADollars 2.08, while SA Brewing, which has recently
proposed a ADollars 6bn merger with Foster's, lost 5 cents to ADollars 3.08.
BANGKOK was firmer although the market still awaited a clear political
direction. The SET index gained 2.42 to 679.52 in low turnover of Bt2.09bn.
SINGAPORE had largely discounted news that one of the major banks was to cut
its prime rate. The Straits Times industrial index put on 0.45 to 1,513.72.
JAKARTA had another good rise, the Jardine Fleming index rising 0.95 to
65.04 on renewed local buying after an interest rate cut this week.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Sharp futures drop
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING futures contracts traded at considerably lower levels yesterday as
uncertainty swept the money markets about the future of European Monetary
Union.
The decision of the Danish people not to participate in EMU caused
uncertainty in all sterling futures trading, as dealers questioned the
principle of monetary convergence in the long term and the strength of
sterling in the immediate future. Fears that EMU is in danger encouraged
foreign exchange traders to invest heavily in the D-Mark, and pushed
sterling briefly below DM2.92 in the afternoon. Believing that a weaker
pound may hinder the possibility of a base rate cut in the Autumn, futures
traders pushed contracts down.
Trading in an 11-tick range, the September contract closed at 90.25, having
closed at 90.35 the previous night. Yesterday's closing price suggests that
the market believes that the 3-month interbank rate in September will be at
9.75 per cent.
The December contract was even more heavily affected. Trading in a 12-tick
range, it ended the day at 90.48 from a previous close of 90.60. That
suggests that the market believes that 3-month Libor at the end of the year
will be at 9.52 per cent.
Rates in the cash markets were less heavily affected, because the Bank of
England forecast a small shortage of Pounds 100m. The Bank did not operate
at all during the day.
As a result, money remained cheap, with most players able to square their
books at an overnight rate of 8 per cent. That cheap rate fed through to the
short periods. 1-month money ended the day at 9 15/16 per cent,  1/16 per
cent softer than the previous night's close. However, 3-month money, a key
indicator of the way the markets think rates are moving, ended at 10 1/16
per cent, up  1/16 on the previous close.
The cash market in Danish krone was strongly affected by the referendum
decision. Denmark raised the 14-day Certificate of Deposit rate from 9.85
per cent to 10.5 per cent.
In Germany, call money eased slightly after the Bundesbank made a generous
allocation of funds in this week's tender for repurchase funds. A net
DM8.3bn flowed into the market, and call money eased to 9.65 per cent from
9.70.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Danish vote rocks currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE D-MARK made significant gains against several European currencies
yesterday after Denmark's decision not to ratify the Maastricht treaty threw
foreign exchange markets into confusion, writes James Blitz.
The prospect that European monetary convergence has been delayed, or
possibly abandoned, forced investors to unwind positions in sterling, the
Italian lira and the French franc, and pledge themselves to what they see as
the anchor currency of Europe - the D-Mark.
After very active trading in London, sterling ended the day two pfennings
down from Tuesday's close, to DM2.9150. It also closed second from bottom of
the European Monetary System grid, above the Danish krone, and nearly a cent
down against the US dollar at Dollars 1.8165.
The Italian lira also took a  1/2 per cent loss against the D-Mark. The
D-Mark ended the day at Lira 756.10 from a previous close of Lira 752.30.
The French Franc also suffered, moving to FFr3.3680 against the D-Mark from
a previous close of FFr3.3560. However, the French currency appeared to
shrug off potential losses after President Francois Mitterrand announced
that France would also be having a referendum on EMU later this year.
The Bank of Portugal was forced to intervene in the markets after Denmark's
currency threatened to fall below its permitted limits in the European
Monetary System. The Bank of Portugal bought D-Marks for escudos at 83.01,
83.05 and 83.06 escudos to dampen the Portuguese currency after it
approached a 6.10 per cent differential against the Danish krone. The Danish
authorities compounded this with a rise of 0.65 percentage points in money
market rates, slowing the krone's descent. Denmark's currency ended the day
at around DKr3.8650 against the D-Mark, from DKr3.840 on Tuesday.
Analysts are unsure about the immediate outlook for currency rates in the
EMS. 'The major part of the upward movement of the D-Mark has probably
happened, and the situation should stabilise,' said Mr Christian Dunis, a
Treasury analyst at Chemical Bank in London. 'But the markets are getting
the impression that European union is an a la carte thing where countries
can pick what they want, and this view will cost Emu a lot of credibility.'
Others believe that the possibility of an EMS realignment is greater. 'ERM
realignment expectations can only be encouraged by overnight developments,'
said one London analyst. 'One questions whether the commitment to current
parities will be as durable without the external discipline provided by the
convergence criteria.' The Italian lira is often cited as a prime candidate
for a devaluation.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Tea price fall baffles London
traders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FALL in the price of tea from a peak struck at the beginning of May is
baffling tea traders, who say that the effect of the droughts that have hit
production around the world has worsened.
Quality tea fetched 155p a kilogram at this week's London auction, compared
with 180p early last month and 150p at the beginning of the year. Traders,
who were convinced that a sellers' market was emerging, say that prices have
gone off the boil in other world markets.
About 60,000 tonnes of production has been lost in the first quarter because
of droughts in Africa, southern India and Sri Lanka. Many areas are are past
their peak growing periods, so that the lost output is irreplaceable.
World supply and demand has been roughly in balance at 2.5m tonnes,
according to Mr Illtyd Lewis, executive director of the UK Tea Council. Now
traders are estimating a 25,000 tonne deficit at the end of the year.
'That's not a lot, but in the context of a finely balanced market it's quite
interesting, he said.
Stocks in consuming countries are low. In the UK basic stocks are down to
about 30m kgs from last year's 34.4m kgs, itself considered to be a low
level.
The wild card remains the CIS. Traders believe the Russians are in the
market for tea, but believe they are having problems arranging finance for
their trade with India.
Mr Lewis said the market would remain tense until the size of the north
Indian crop is known in a few weeks' time. 'The market could be very
volatile if a big buyer like the CIS comes back in,' he added. 'Everything
is very tight - there is no give in the market.'
The UK was last year once again the single biggest importer of tea, having
been displaced in 1989 and 1990 by the former Soviet Union following the
nuclear accident at Chernobyl, which affected local tea crops. The UK
imported 178,000 tonnes, of which 32,000 tonnes were re-exported, according
to the annual report of the Tea Council, published yesterday.
Tea remains the most popular drink in Britain, with 80 per cent of the
population drinking it daily compared with coffee's 56.6 per cent. Average
consumption was 3.56 cups a day last year, compared with 1.68 cups of
coffee.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Renewed rally lifts Brent crude
above Dollars 21 a barrel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH SEA oil prices yesterday topped Dollars 21 a barrel for the first time
in seven months, renewing the rally sparked by the decision of the
Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries to leave output unchanged for
the third quarter. Brent crude for July delivery gained 32 1/2 cents on the
day to close at Dollars 21.12 1/2 , the highest price since November 18 last
year.
Mr Peter Gignoux, head of the energy desk at Smith Barney in London, said:
'We have covered most of the pent-up demand, and the market is tending
higher. The price may have some way to go on the upside - it has moved
faster and consolidated more quickly than I had expected.'
He thought a price of Dollars 21.50 was possible in the short-term.
Brent crude has gained about Dollars 1.50 since before the Opec meeting in
Vienna two weeks ago, on belief that supply and demand in the third quarter
should be well balanced.
Saudi Arabia had widely signalled its intention before the meeting to press
for a rise of 1m barrels a day in the output ceiling. However, the kingdom
unexpectedly accepted a roll-over of the second quarter ceiling.
Traders attributed yesterday's price rise to a fall in US oil stocks, and
political nervousness sparked by an unconfirmed local newspaper report of a
build-up of Saudi troops on the border with Yemen. The two countries have a
long-running dispute over oil-rich land around the border.
New York light crude prices were up 35 cents at Dollars 22.46 in morning
trading.
The key question affecting oil prices in the longer term is whether Saudi
Arabia's behaviour at the Opec meeting marked a fundamental shift in policy
towards supporting a higher price, or was motivated by short-term desires to
improve relations with Iran and send a warning signal to the European
Community and the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro about Opec's opposition to
a carbon tax.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Anglo still biggest mining
company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO AMERICAN Corporation of South Africa is by far the largest mining
company outside the former Communist countries, according to a study
released today by the Raw Materials Group, the Swedish consultancy
organisation. Anglo controlled nearly 9 per cent by value of the western
world's 1990 production of non-fuel minerals compared with the 4.2 per cent
of its nearest rival, RTZ Corporation of the UK.
RMG's list of the top 50 mining companies is slightly subjective in that the
organisation uses unconventional methods to assess whether one corporation
is controlled by another.
For example, although De Beers is quoted separately from Anglo American,
RMG's method suggests it is controlled by Anglo. Many observers would concur
in this particular case, given the very tight links between the two South
African companies, which are widely assumed to be ultimately controlled by
the Oppenheimer family.
'Control can be exercised by many means of which ownership is the most
common and important one. But ownership is not the only way of exercising
control,' say Mr Magnus Ericsson and Mr Andreas Tegen, authors of the study.
'We look at ownership and management to determine who is in control of a
specific company.'
Apart from the inclusion of De Beers, Anglo is also helped to its top spot
by being the dominant producer of two high-value products: gold and
diamonds.
RMG says that, although Anglo by their measurement has been the world's
biggest mining company since the mid-1980s, its relative strength has been
declining, mainly because of the fall in South Africa's gold production. In
1984 Anglo controlled nearly 16 per cent of western world non-fuel minerals
production, twice the 1990 percentage.
In contrast, since 1984 RTZ has increased its share of production from 3.5
per cent. RTZ was formed only 30 years ago and its recent progress was
speeded considerably by the Dollars 4bn acquisition of most of British
Petroleum's non-fuel minerals and mining assets in 1989.
State-owned companies are still important in the mining and metals
industries. Among those in RMG's top 50 are Outokumpu of Finland; Codelco of
Chile; BRGM and Pechiney of France; the Malaysian Mining Corporation;
Brazil's CVRD and Sweden's LKAB . The revival of US companies is also
evident from the statistics. In 1984 the US companies accounted for only 10
per cent of production by the 50 largest mining groups but by 1990 this was
up to 13 per cent. The authors point out, however, that the US groups still
have some way to go to recover to the 20 per cent they controlled in 1975.
Only one Japanese company appears in the RMG top 50 - Mitsui at 49.
The main thrust of the study is to keep track of the ownership, control,
percentage shareholdings, joint ventures, subsidiaries and affiliations in
the mining and metals industry.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Recession cuts deeply into
earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN ANALYSIS of the 1991 financial results of 180 large base and precious
metals producers world-wide shows severe damage was caused by the recession
in most industrialised countries and the consequent fall in metals prices.
There was also a sharp rise in extraordinary losses and write-downs arising
from mistakes metals companies made during the boom in the late 1980s,
according to the latest financial review from the Metals &amp; Minerals Research
Services consultancy organisation.
Pre-tax extraordinary losses of the companies sampled reached a record
USDollars 2.41bn, equivalent to 22 per cent of 1991 operating profits.
MMRS says pre and after-tax extraordinary write-downs were commonplace among
metals producers. It suggests these were necessary because some companies
either paid too much for assets or acquired assets with little connection to
their core businesses.
The other set of write-downs identified by MMRS came from companies forced
to sell non-core assets below book prices simply to stay in business.
Drawing on its computerised financial data, MMRS says that the aggregate
turnover of the 180 metals companies fell last year by only 3.2 per cent
from the 1990 level to Dollars 166bn. Given that base metals prices fell on
average by 18 per cent last year and gold prices were 6 per cent lower, MMRS
believes 'this was quite a creditable result'.
However, this fall in revenue removed one quarter of 1990's operating
profits and operating costs, up 2.9 per cent, took away another 20 per cent.
Pre-tax profits fell by nearly two-thirds to Dollars 6.54bn after the
write-downs and a 7.5 per cent rise in net interest payments. The pre-tax
result was 75 per cent below the 1989 peak.
After-tax profits fared even worse and at Dollars 3.44bn were 70 per cent
below those for 1990 and little more than 20 per cent of those for 1989.
After-tax write downs, a record Dollars 1.3bn, left net earnings of Dollars
1.71bn.
Operating profit margins across MMRS's sample of companies averaged 6.6 per
cent last year compared with a recent peak of 18.2 per cent in 1988 and a
healthy 17.1 per cent in 1989. Margins were well below the 10.3 per cent
recorded in 1986 in the depths of the previous recession.
Pre-tax profit margins were 3.9 per cent compared with 1988's peak 17.5 per
cent. Return on capital employed was only 5.7 per cent, the lowest MMRS has
recorded since it started collecting the data 16 years ago. In 1988 the
return was 18.5 per cent.
Return on shareholders' funds was only 1.6 per cent but better than that
achieved in 1985. The 1988 peak was 19.2 per cent.
MMRS suggests that producers can draw some comfort from the fact that
aggregate gearing (debt as a percentage of issued capital) in 1991 rose by
less than 2 percentage points. However, the level of 41.4 per cent was
'still uncomfortably high and a level exceeded only on four occasions since
1976'.

FT  04 JUN 92 / World Commodities Prices: Wool
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WOOL market is approaching its dull between-season period and prices are
showing no pronounced trend in either direction. From a trading point of
view this persuades buyers to postpone action for as long as they can,
making it difficult for margins to be maintained. The cheaper forward seller
gets whatever business is going and the amount of hand-to-mouth buying is
limited. The Australian Wool Corporation's overall market indicator has
shown very small changes, with particular buying orders having a distorting
effect in individual categories. At 593c/kg on June 3 it was unchanged on
the week.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS grain trade switch forecast
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER Soviet Union, which has supported the world grain market for 20
years with its huge purchases, could be transformed into a grain exporter by
the turn of the century, trade experts believe, reports Reuter from Berlin.
For many grain traders meeting here at the annual congress of Coceral, the
European Community cereals lobby, the question was not whether members of
the Commonwealth of Independent States would achieve self-sufficiency, but
when.
'By the year 2000 Russia could be independent of grain imports,' predicted
Mr Rudolf Stoehr, Coceral's president. Higher prices, falling demand and a
new incentive to produce for the market would all contribute the shift, he
said. And Ukraine and Kazahkstan - two key grain-producing republics - could
be exporting well before then.
Mr Oleg Klimov, head of the Exportkhleb, grain agent for Russia and 12 other
former Soviet republics, looked forward to the day when he would execute
exports instead of imports.
'In five years' time we might well be an exporter,' he said. 'Look at Poland
and Czechoslovakia. They were importers two years ago, now they are
exporters. The same can happen in our country.'
Mr Klimov said imports in the 1992-93 season, starting next month, would
plunge to between 20m and 25m tonnes from 38m tonnes in 1991-92. The
International Wheat Council recently predicted a more cautious figure of 27m
tonnes.
But the trend is clear - and this time a bigger crop in 1992 is only part of
the reason. Price liberalisation has triggered a structural change in grain
consumption within the CIS.
In the past, huge subsidies meant bread cost only 50 per cent of the price
of the wheat used to make it. So farmers fed whole loaves to their pigs.
Today rocketing prices have pushed many foodstuffs out of consumers' reach
and consumption has crashed. 'Consumption of grain for food and (animal)
feed will decline significantly,' Mr Stoehr said.
Higher prices should also give more incentive for action on the notorious
waste problems. Nearly one third of the CIS grain crop is wasted, either
eaten by pests or spoiled by rain while it lies on the ground waiting to be
collected by trains and trucks.

GOLD moved above Dollars 340 a troy ounce briefly on the London bullion
market before producer selling abruptly halted the short covering rally.
PLATINUM futures were lower on Nymex at midday as profit taking emerged
after Tuesday's steep rise. Analysts said July platinum would consolidate
recent gains and try for around Dollars 384. They cited continued concerns
over the availability of physical supply, particularly in Europe - the EC
has set the end of this year as the deadline for new model cars to have
catalytic converters. The London's robusta COFFEE futures clawed back
earlier losses of up to Dollars 20 a tonne. Dealers attributed the recovery
to sentiment that Tuesday's sell-off in New York might have been overdone.
ZINC prices fell on the LME, although the premium for cash metal remains
high at Dollars 150.50 a tonne. The market remains nervous, with
fundamentals pointing to a lower price but traders fearing the technical
squeeze on June supplies could be repeated in July, where there is already a
large call option open position between Dollars 1,300 and Dollars 1,400. TIN
staged a downward reaction to recent gains after the three-month price
failed to move above resistance at Dollars 6,500.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australia rejects curb on NZ
shearers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA MOVED quickly yesterday to defuse a potential row with New Zealand
over the status of thousands of New Zealand sheep shearers whose presence
has caused mounting tension in the wool industry.
Senator Gareth Evans, the foreign minister, said Canberra would resist
growing demands for the imposition of work permits, which would undermine
progress towards the integration of the New Zealand and Australian
economies. He told Mr Don McKinnon, his New Zealand counterpart, that the
government was determined to maintain freedom of travel and employment
between the two countries, which has existed since the 1920s.
Reciprocal employment rights are not included in the Closer Economic
Relations treaty between the two countries, which is designed to create
bilateral free trade in goods and services. However, the Australian
government is aware that any diminution of travel and employment rights
would be resisted by New Zealand, and could damage further progress towards
the creation of a joint economy.
The dispute blew up on Tuesday when the ruling Labor Party's backbench MPs
and Senators called for restrictions on the freedom of New Zealand shearers
to work in Australia. The call followed a report from Labor's backbench
immigration committee recommending limits on settlement rights for New
Zealanders, who now constitute one of Australia's largest immigrant
communities.
Unease over New Zealand immigration has been simmering for some time
following a big increase in settlement since the mid-1980s.
The Australian Workers' Union, which represents shearers, claims the New
Zealanders undercut established wages by avoiding tax and failing to
register with regulatory authorities. The union claims that about 42 per
cent of the Australian wool clip is now shorn by New Zealanders, and that
more than half of Australian shearers are out of work.
Officials say violence has already broken out in some of the remote rural
communities where the shearing is carried out, and warn of more serious
clashes unless New Zealand access is restricted.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: SIB approves unit trust
investment in Mexico
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican Stock Exchange was approved last week for unit trust investment
by the UK's Securities and Investments Board.
The lifting of the restriction means that authorised unit trusts are no
longer limited to investing a maximum of 10 per cent in Mexico as an
unapproved market.
The SIB said it had taken the decision in response to requests from a number
of fund managers. 'The SIB approval is a huge relief,' said Mr James
Fairweather, manager of Martin Currie's Emerging Markets unit trust.
The approval is unlikely to lead to rush of single country Mexico unit
trusts but the ruling will give fund managers greater flexibility. The 10
per cent limit applies to investments throughout the fund, a particular
limitation on emerging markets funds.
'It had tied our hands in other countries such as Brazil and China, and it
now gives us great flexibility,' said Mr Fairweather.
Mexican companies placed around Dollars 4.8bn of stock last year and have
raised another Dollars 3.6bn so far this year. Most of the Mexican stock
sold internationally has been through American Depository Receipts in New
York. UK unit trusts funds can now invest directly in Mexican stock.
Mr Kevin Carter of Providence Capitol, which has a Latin America unit trust,
said the move would improve the liquidity of the market since ADRs represent
only a sub-sector of shares in a company's issue. 'Mexico is a large,
well-established market, and it was sensible to have it approved,' he said.
France plans to reduce by half the amount of tax-free capital gains allowed
on money market mutual funds.
The measure is aimed at promoting a new long-term savings account product
that invests in French equities.
Money market funds have experienced strong growth in recent years, at the
cost of other investment vehicles.

AXA, one of France's largest insurance groups, has increased its wine
interests by buying control of Chateau Suduiraut, one of the best-known
sources of Sauternes wine, in a deal worth around FFr108m (Dollars 20m).
Chateau Suduiraut, a 17th century castle at Preignac in the Gironde region
of south-west France, produces one of France's most famous Sauternes.
The chateau, in which Axa is acquiring a 51 per cent stake, has an estate of
200 hectares, of which 88 are currently in production.
Axa, together with a number of other French financial institutions including
Groupe des Assurances Nationales and Assurances Generales de France in
insurance and the Credit Foncier bank, is an active investor in the wine
industry. It already has wine interests in Pauillac, Pomerol, Saint-Emilion
and Burgundy.
Fimat, the futures broking unit of France's Societe Generale, has reinforced
its presence in Singapore by buying Babcock Fulton Prebon, one of the
market's leading participants. As a result, Fimat will become a clearing
member of the Singapore International Monetary Exchange.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Foster's shares rise as
investors back BHP decision
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOSTER'S Brewing Group shares rose 8 cents to a 19-month high of ADollars
2.08 yesterday as Australian investors showed their support for a decision
by Broken Hill Proprietary (BHP) to put Mr John Elliott's International
Brewing Investments (IBI) into receivership.
Analysts said BHP's action had laid the groundwork for a significant
recovery in the value of Foster's shares, which have been depressed by the
financial instability of IBI and International Brewing Holdings (IBH), its
privately-owned parent.
BHP shares closed unchanged at ADollars 14.40, indicating that investors
believe BHP has the financial strength to carry out its pledge to stabilise
Foster's by doubling its exposure to the group to more than ADollars 2bn
(USDollars 1.53bn).
BHP appointed receivers to IBI on Tuesday after Mr Elliott failed to produce
a plan to repay its preference investment, which amounts to more than
ADollars 1bn including accumulated interest.
Mr Elliott controlled 32 per cent of Foster's through IBI, and a further 6
per cent was directly owned by IBH, a private company established by
Foster's managers in 1989.
IBH acquired loans of about ADollars 2.6bn to finance the acquisition of its
Foster's shareholding, which was worth about ADollars 1.6bn when the
receivers moved in. The company was unable to meet interest payments because
of a lack of dividends on the Foster's shares, its only asset.
Mr Elliott is expected to return to Australia from New York shortly to
discuss the receivership with Mr David Crawford, the KPMG Peat Marwick
accountant who has been appointed joint receiver of IBI.
BHP is believed to be keen to develop proposals for a merger with Foster's
put forward last month by SA Brewing, the South Australian drinks and
industrial group.
Meanwhile, BHP said talks were continuing with a syndicate of banks led by
Hongkong Bank Australia, which is owed ADollars 1.2bn by IBI. BHP has
offered to buy the debt to prevent a dispute over security which could
destabilise Foster's. BHP has revealed no details of the buy-out deal, but
it is believed to have offered to repay the principal, plus interest and
costs.
Two Australian wine concerns have agreed to merge and list on the Australian
Stock Exchange, AP-DJ reports from Adelaide. Berri Renmano, an unlisted
public wine concern, proposed last month to merge with Thomas Hardy. The
merger will form Australia's second biggest wine company.
The merged company, to be known as BRL Hardy, will have sales of over
ADollars 200m.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Control Data aims for more than
mere survival - US computer group sees radical surgery as a solution to its
difficulties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER years of divestitures and closures to tackle mounting problems,
Control Data, the US computer group, has decided to undergo radical surgery
aimed at ensuring growth rather than mere survival.
The company, which was already a shadow of its former self, split into two
independent companies in a determined move to become a more sharply-focused
information services company.
A proud pioneer of the computer industry, Control Data, under the new name
of Ceridian, will be transformed into a provider of computer services.
The spin-off company, Computer Data Systems, will comprise the remnants of a
computer manufacturer that in its heyday was seen as a challenger to
International Business Machines.
Control Data made its mark in the 1960s with high-speed computers for
scientists and engineers designed by its star engineer, Mr Seymour Cray.
Then, in the early 1970s, Mr Cray left to form his own company, Cray
Research, which went on to dominate the supercomputer market.
Control Data's founder, Mr William Norris, began an ill-fated round of
acquisitions, taking the company into dozens of fields that were unrelated
to its computer technology roots.
The company payroll expanded from 13 employees in 1957 to more than 60,000
worldwide by the early 1980s, while sales peaked at Dollars 5bn in 1984.
Since then, Control Data has been on a downward spiral. Revenues slid to
Dollars 1.5bn last year, when the company recorded losses of Dollars 9.8m.
'This company has faced enormous difficulties since 1984,' Mr Lawrence
Perlman, president and chief executive, ac-knowledged. Over the past few
years, Control Data has sold several businesses, including its supercomputer
business, commercial credit operations and computer disk drive manufacturing
in efforts to cut costs.
'Most of what we've done up to now has been aimed at survival,' said Mr
Perlman. 'Now we are able to take actions that have the potential to enable
the businesses to grow.'
Under the plans announced last week, Control Data Systems will be formed
from Control Data Corporation's computer products group.
The computer company will start life with annual revenues of about Dollars
600m and a base of more than 1,000 customers.
The remaining services and defence businesses, which last year accounted for
about two-thirds of Control Data's total revenues, will be renamed Ceridian.
This company's operations will include computer services, such as payroll
processing.
It will also own Arbitron, which provides audience ratings for television
shows; a service that authorises cheques and credit cards for retailers; and
a group that designs computer systems for government agencies.
The split frees Ceridian to pursue its service businesses without the cloud
of losses from Control Data's computer products operations. It will also
enable the restructured company to present a clearer message to potential
investors and partners, Mr Perlman believes. As the president and chief
executive of Ceridian, Mr Perlman aims to put the company on a growth path.
He sees opportunities to expand the company's payroll and employee services
business.
'We are the second largest payroll processor, but we only have about 4 per
cent of the market. We can make some modest acquisitions to expand our
presence in that market. There is a lot of potential for growth.'
Ceridian also aims to expand its government systems business, which has
traditionally focused upon large-scale defence contracts, into civilian
government agency contracts.
Overall, Ceridian should be able to increase its revenues at a rate of about
10 per cent a year, Mr Perlman estimated.
After a transition period, the computer spin-off, Control Data Systems, may
also be able to achieve profitable growth, he predicted.
Currently, however, the computer products group is operating at a loss, but
when it becomes an independent company Control Data Systems will be
profitable, said Mr James Ousley, who will become president and chief
executive of the newly-formed company. He has run Control Data's computer
products group for the past three years.
Since 1989, the computer products group has been focusing upon 'open
systems' products that adhere to industry standards. Although sales of these
new products are growing, they have yet to compensate for a decline in
revenues from proprietary systems.
The new company will be able to 'pick and chose' the best technologies
available and form relationships with companies that provide them, Mr Ousley
said, suggesting this will give Control Data Systems an edge over
competitors who are aligned to one technology source. Forming strategic
partnerships and finding equity investors proved impossible for the Control
Data computer group until the plan to spin off the business as an
independent company became known, said Mr Ousley.
Silicon Graphics, whose workstation products are resold by Control Data, has
now agreed to take a 10 per cent equity stake in the new company and
strengthen ties with marketing and technology sharing agreements.
NEC of Japan has also tentatively agreed to take a 5 per cent stake in
Control Data Systems and expand its existing supercomputer marketing
agreement to include joint marketing and development activities in RISC
microprocessors and UNIX software.
Whether the sum of the parts of Control Data will be more successful than
the whole remains to be seen. It is clear, however, the company had little
choice but to submit itself to radical surgery if it was to have any chance
of recovery.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hong Kong and Shenzhen in talks
on dual listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALEXANDER NICOLL, Asia Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES listed on the Shenzhen stock exchange in southern China could be
traded on the Hong Kong stock market if talks under way between the two
markets bear fruit, according to officials of the Shenzhen exchange.
The dual listing would cover 'B' shares, which are listed in Shenzhen but
may only be traded by foreigners and paid for in foreign currency. However,
the proposal still has to be approved by authorities in both China and Hong
Kong.
The Shenzhen officials were in London yesterday as part of a round-the-world
trip with Credit Lyonnais Securities Asia. They are also visiting Edinburgh,
Paris, New York and Washington. They held talks with the London Stock
Exchange and made a presentation to brokers and fund managers.
The Shenzhen market, one of two stock exchanges in China, has met huge
investor demand since it began trading in December 1990. This reflects
growing prosperity in Shenzhen, a special economic zone bordering Hong Kong,
as well as in the rest of southern China. Foreign investors are attracted by
the sharply rising market and the opportunities opening up in China.
Questions from British-based institutions reflected their hesitancy to
become involved. They concerned the violence surrounding queues outside
Shenzhen brokers' offices, information provided by listed companies, the
quality of new issue prospectuses, pricing of new issues, gaps between
payment for new issues and listing, absence of securities law, and failure
to consolidate subsidiaries in accounts.
Mr Zhen Qinan, assistant general manager of the exchange, said Beijing
officials had recently visited it and were drawing up a securities law which
would cover insider trading, fraud and investor protection.
Mr Zhang Hongyi, vice-mayor of Shenzhen, said funds were being formed with
the aim of creating investing institutions for the domestic 'A' share market
and removing part of the speculative element.
However, officials admitted that regulations were still inadequate.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Agreement signed for Australian
Airlines sale
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian government and Qantas yesterday signed heads of agreement for
the international airline's ADollars 400m (USDollars 303m) purchase of
Australian Airlines, the government-owned domestic airline.
The signing clears the way for the sale of 35 per cent of the merged airline
to foreign carriers, followed by the sale of 15 per cent by tender to
Australian institutions and a flotation of the remaining 50 per cent.
Mr Bill Dix, Qantas chairman, said the sale value of the merged airline
would be between ADollars 2.5bn and ADollars 3bn. Qantas hopes about
ADollars 1bn will be set aside by the government for recapitalisation.
Qantas expects the trade sale component of the sale to be completed by the
end of this year. The flotation is expected to take place in March or April
next year.
British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand are the only
overseas airlines to have emerged as serious bidders for Qantas and
Australian.
In a separate development, the Australian and New Zealand governments said
some trans-Tasman routes would be opened to carriers other than Qantas and
Air New Zealand from November.

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK'S US subsidiary will soon need at least Dollars 30m more than
its cash-flow is generating if it is to carry on servicing its US debt and
avoid a possible US bankruptcy filing.
The Canadian property developer, which has already placed its Canary Wharf
project into administration in the UK and filed for bankruptcy protection in
Canada, is hoping to sell a major Manhattan property and a series of
financial assets before the end of this month in order to raise the needed
cash.
The danger of O&amp;Y bank creditors breaking ranks was highlighted a few days
ago when Svenska Handelsbanken of Sweden brought a lawsuit in New York
demanding the prepayment of a Dollars 12.5m unsecured line of credit to O&amp;Y.
O&amp;Y is due to respond in court to the Svenska legal action later this month.
A ruling requiring O&amp;Y to pay Svenska could eventually trigger cross-default
mechanisms among US bank creditors.
Negotiations concerning the sale of an O&amp;Y 34-storey Park Avenue building -
to Mutual of America, an insurance company - are understood to be at an
advanced phase.
But the sale, if it goes through, is expected to provide only enough net
cash for O&amp;Y to pay off more than Dollars 100m of mortgage loans on the
property that are owed to a bank consortium led by First Chicago.
The sale of financial assets is meanwhile being pursued in order to generate
the Dollars 30m of cash needed to make principal and interest payments on
other New York properties.
O&amp;Y is in technical default on several New York mortgage obligations,
including a missed principal payment on its Liberty Plaza building in lower
Manhattan and a missed interest payment on a Euroyen bond related to Tower B
of the World Financial Centre.
In both of these cases, O&amp;Y has obtained a temporary standstill agreement
with creditors and is seeking to restructure its debt obligations.

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SEAGRAM, one of the world's largest drinks groups, says its international
spirits and wine business improved profit in the first quarter ended April
30 because of a broad restructuring, especially in Europe, and a sharper
focus on premium and core brands.
But overall group net income slipped to USDollars 167m, or 44 cents a share,
from Dollars 188m, or 50 cents a share, in the 1991 first quarter.
'Margins continued to improve despite the lost contribution of divested
brands and difficult economic conditions in North America, Europe, Japan and
Brazil,' said Mr Edgar Bronfman Sr, chairman.
The Tropicana fruit juice unit turned in a strong performance but operating
income was negatively affected by heavy investment in international
expansion.
Seagram, one of the world's top four drinks groups, said sales dipped to
Dollars 1.24bn from Dollars 1.4bn because of the brand divestments and
foreign accounting changes. Final operating income from the drinks and juice
businesses was Dollars 166m, against Dollars 165m.
Including Dollars 69m dividends received from the Du Pont chemicals giant,
owned 25.5 per cent by Seagram, income after taxes was Dollars 120m, or 32
cents a share, up 4.3 per cent from a year earlier. But Seagram also shares
in Du Pont's unremitted earnings and these were sharply lower in the quarter
because of the impact of the recession on Du Pont's results.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Allied-Signal gets into shape -
Martin Dickson looks at the improved performance of the US group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SHARE price says it all: In the year since Mr Lawrence Bossidy was named
as chairman of Allied-Signal, the stock market value of one of America's
biggest industrial technology companies has more than doubled.
The increase - from around Dollars 29 a share to about Dollars 60 - was
initially due to Mr Bossidy's reputation as one of America's top managers.
But more recently the increase has reflected the remarkable improvement in
Allied's performance as he has imposed a slimming and muscle-toning regimen
on what had been a distinctly flabby body.
The question now is whether, with the easiest improvements already in hand,
he can keep the share price rising.
A tall, intense man, who speaks at breakneck speed, Mr Bossidy came to
Allied from General Electric, the industrial and financial services group
which has a reputation as one of the best-managed companies in the US. For
seven years, Mr Bossidy had been number two to GE's chairman, Mr Jack Welch,
and before that he masterminded the creation of GE's huge financial services
arm.
At Allied he replaced Mr Edward Hennessy, who retired after 12 years as
chairman. During that time he turned a stodgy chemical company - Allied
Chemical - into a Dollars 12bn turnover high technology conglomerate through
acquisitions such as Bendix (in 1983) and Signal (1985).
The result is a company with three legs: aerospace, with products such as
aircraft engines and brakes; automotive, making parts such as braking
systems, seat belts and spark plugs; and engineered materials, making
products ranging from carpet fibres to automotive catalysts.
The Hennessy years made Allied a much stronger (albeit still rather
anonymous) company, less vulnerable to the economic cycle. But, along the
way, it lost a clear sense of direction, and its proliferating bureaucracy
and loose management controls contributed to a lacklustre earnings record
and poor image on Wall Street.
Enter Mr Bossidy, bursting with the latest management ideas, fine-honed at
General Electric. His conclusion: Allied was potentially a fine company with
strong market positions in each of its fields and good technology. But it
was not working its assets hard enough and not getting the best out of
employees.
He has set some ambitious long-term financial goals, including boosting the
operating margin from 5 per cent to 9 per cent by 1994, improving
productivity by 6 per cent a year, and reaching a return on equity of 18 per
cent by 1994, against 10.5 per cent last year.
Stage one has involved a wholesale streamlining of the business. Plants have
been consolidated (mainly in the automotive business); materials purchasing
has been centralised to achieve economies of scale; so too have group
services, for example with one data centre replacing 10. The salaried
workforce is being cut by 6,200, or 16 per cent.
Mr Bossidy estimates all this will produce savings of Dollars 400m a year by
1994, with the bulk of that - Dollars 300m - coming through this year,
giving a Dollars 1.30 a share boost to earnings. The company believes this
will allow it to earn from Dollars 3.60 to Dollars 3.85 a share this year,
depending on the strength of the US economic recovery, compared with Dollars
2.51 in 1991 (before one-time restructuring charges).
He has also reversed what had become a rather worrying drain of cash from
the business, which in the middle of last year looked likely to total
Dollars 750m on an annual basis. However, Allied preserved cash by measures
such as cutting its dividend and increasing the intensity with which it
turns over working capital.
The company has long been criticised by Wall Street for excessive R and D
spending, and Mr Bossidy has attacked this, too, capping 1992 spending at
Dollars 380m a year, roughly the same as 1991, and insisting the money be
used more productively.
All these measures meant the cash drain from the business last year was just
Dollars 195m, while this year it is expecting cash-flow to be neutral. Mr
Bossidy also wants to reduce the group's indebtedness, which currently
stands at 42 per cent of total capital, through the disposal of Allied's US
oil and gas assets, which the company values at Dollars 1bn. But at the
moment the market for energy assets is weak.
While this quick-fire action has certainly given an impressive boost to the
company's financial performance, it remains questionable just how strongly
it can keep growing over the long haul. After all, it faces intense
international competition in all of its markets, and the aerospace sector
looks particularly vulnerable, given US defence cuts and a weak commercial
aviation market.
Mr Bossidy says Allied will greatly benefit from even a moderate upturn in
the depressed US auto market, and its chemicals side will also be helped by
a US economic rebound.
As for aerospace, he points out that sales to the Pentagon account for only
34 per cent of the subsidiary's total, and that most of these revenues come
from mature programmes, where there is a lot of demand for spare parts which
should decline slowly. 'While we will be hurt to some extent . . . we don't
think its going to be a dramatic dislocation.' As for the civil side, he
acknowledges the airlines are currently suffering, but thinks this will be a
good business in the long term.
The company is still working on its long-term strategic plan, which it
expects to unveil after a major management debate this summer.
Mr Bossidy argues that for a company such as Allied to succeed in the 1990s
it needs two essential ingredients: improving productivity to boost margins,
because competition will keep a lid on its ability to raise prices; and 'a
global reach because markets are going to become less distinguished.'
He is pushing for productivity improvements through the fashionable theory
of total quality management - the idea of driving for continuous quality
improvements by concentrating on customers needs and worker involvement. The
aim is to train all employees by the end of next year, and Mr Bossidy says
it is vital that this genuinely changes the group's culture and is not 'just
a banner, a slogan, a lot of fluff.'
As for international growth, Allied already has a large presence in Europe,
which accounts for Dollars 2.9bn of group sales and 15,000 of its 94,000
employees. The bulk of this comes from automotive components, but earlier
this month it began a big expansion of its industrial fibres operation with
construction of a new Dollars 220m plant in France.
Mr Bossidy, who also sees major opportunities in south-east Asia, hopes to
build the group's overseas sales to 40 to 45 per cent of the group total,
from 30 per cent now.
Acquisitions, both domestic and foreign, will have a role in the growth. Mr
Bossidy says he would like to do two or three Dollars 300m niche takeovers a
year.
He has certainly made a dramatic, racing start. But sustaining the
improvement in Allied's performance, as he himself acknowledges, is going to
require a fundamental change in the corporation's culture. The hardest part
may just be beginning.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Trizec in fresh move to prop up
Bramalea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRIZEC, North America's biggest publicly-traded real estate developer, has
again moved to prop up its 67 per cent-owned subsidiary, Bramalea, in a
protracted bid to avert another spectacular collapse in the Canadian
property industry.
Bramalea, which has debts of CDollars 4.8bn (USDollars 4bn), will gain a
little extra breathing room by selling a shopping mall in Alberta to another
Trizec-controlled company, and a 50 per cent stake in a mall in Ottawa to
Ontario's municipal pension fund.
Bramalea over-extended itself in the housing market in California and
Ontario during the boom of the mid-1980s. Besides 28m sq ft in office and
shopping centre space, it rents out more than 3,000 apartments and
townhouses, and owns 5,000 acres of undeveloped land, about one-third of it
in California.
Bramalea is burdened with financial problems which are at least as severe as
those of Toronto-based Olympia &amp; York.
O&amp;Y's troubles have further clouded Bramalea's prospects. Mr Marvin
Marshall, Bramalea's president, said yesterday institutional investors had
become more hesitant about investing in real estate since O&amp;Y's liquidity
crisis surfaced earlier this year.
This reluctance is likely to force Bramalea to revise its target of selling
CDollars 1bn in assets within the next 30 months.
The company is in the throes of drawing up a new strategic plan to take
account of the recent deterioration in the business climate.
Nonetheless, Bramalea's eagerness to dispose of assets appears so far to
have assuaged its main lenders.
'I don't see how a receiver could do a better job,' one Toronto real estate
financier said, noting that property brokers both in the US and Canada are
actively seeking buyers for numerous Bramalea properties.
Mr Marshall expressed confidence that the company faced no threat from its
banks.
With debt and equity markets unreceptive to providing more funds, Trizec's
continued support is seen as crucial to Bramalea's prospects.
Both companies are part of the vast resources, financial services and
consumer products empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family.
Two months ago, Trizec invested CDollars 76m in a Bramalea rights issue
which was shunned by outside investors. The rights were offered at CDollars
4 apiece. Bramalea's shares were trading at CDollars 1.85 on the Toronto
stock exchange yesterday.
Trizec has also agreed to take dividends from Bramalea in the form of stock,
rather than cash. Trizec itself has debts of CDollars 9bn. Although it has a
more secure cash-flow than Bramalea, Trizec's share price has tumbled to its
lowest level in more than two decades.
Bramalea said that the sales of the Alberta and Ottawa shopping malls would
reduce its debt by CDollars 48m and provide additional working capital of
CDollars 10.5m.
The company last week also reached an agreement to sell 50 per cent of two
central Toronto office buildings, including its own head office, to the
Ontario teachers' pension fund.

<TEXT>
US ADVERTISING has reversed its two-year decline, according to Repap
Enterprises, North America's third-biggest producer of coated papers for
magazines and newspaper inserts. Industry order backlogs, it added, were
running 25 per cent higher year to year.
'The US recovery is under way,' Mr George Petty, chairman, said, after
Repap's annual meeting. 'A price rise of 6 to 12 per cent, according to
grade, due July 1 should stick and European producers will go along.'
The increase was led by Champion International, the leading producer.
Groundwood coated papers now sell for USDollars 680 to USDollars 800 a short
ton.
Repap has completed CDollars 2bn (USDollars 1.6bn) investments at its New
Brunswick and Wisconsin coated paper mills and at its big north-western
British Columbia softwoods kraft pulp mill. It was caught by severely
depressed pulp and paper markets last year, and delayed a big pulp expansion
in Manitoba indefinitely.
Repap reduced its losses in the first quarter this year. Mr Petty said that,
with higher prices for pulp and coated papers, second-half cash flow would
cover interest costs and Repap would be back in the black in 1993.
Mr Petty, who admits he underplayed the severity of the recession and Bank
of Canada monetary policies, said he saw 'a new golden era' for Northern
softwood pulp on world markets because little new capacity was coming on
stream.
Also, little new North American coated paper capacity was due on stream by
1995. Producers operated at 92 per cent of capacity in April.
Mr Petty said Repap would concentrate on reducing more than CDollars 1bn in
term debt over the next 18 months.
Repap would retain ownership of its new Alcell pulping technology. The first
full-scale commercial plants to use it would be financed by outside
partners.
A demonstration plant had shown the process could operate on softwood as
well as hardwood.

HEINZ and Hillsdown, the international food groups, yesterday received

Kecskemeti Konzervgyar (Kecskemeti Canning Factory), a Hungarian food
processor.
The companies, which made the only offer for the group, are taking a 93 per
cent stake.
The purchase price was not disclosed, but Heinz and Hillsdown have promised
to make substantial investments in the group.
The Hungarian food processing industry, while seen by investment bankers as
possessing great potential because of the country's strong agricultural
base, is in crisis following the collapse of the market in the former
eastern bloc.
Bekescsabai Konzervgyar, one of the largest canning companies, recently went

<TEXT>
SCHERING, the Berlin-based pharmaceuticals and chemicals group, said it
expected to find a partner for its poorly-performing industrial and organic
chemicals businesses or sell them by the end of July.
Mr Georg Obermeier, finance director of VIAG, the German industrial group,
was quoted as saying his company wanted to buy the two Schering operations,
but a Schering spokeswoman said no decision had been reached.
'We are still talking with several candidates but have not yet chosen one
with whom we would conclude a letter of intent,' Ms Mechthild Weber
explained.
Earlier, Schering shareholders at the annual meeting were told that it was
also seeking a partner or buyer for its electroplating sector by the end of
next month.
Mr Giuseppe Vita, the chairman, said sales were expected to rise by 5 per
cent but that earnings would not reach the record level of last year when
they rose 6 per cent to DM274m.
Despite flourishing pharmaceuticals sales, up 15 per cent in the first four
months of this year, turnover in the important plant protection sector,
which makes up 24 per cent of turnover, plunged 13 per cent in the same
period.
The fall was largely accounted for by weakness in Western European markets.
Other 'risks and burdens' include disproportionally heavy investments in
research and development as well as expansion of marketing.
Personnel costs, too, had risen sharply and could not be compensated for by
higher prices.
He said the EC's cuts in subsidies for grain and reductions in farmland were
further handicaps.
Mr Vita, the only Italian national to head a large German company, said the
pharmaceuticals sector, making up 56.4 per cent of total group sales, would
be reorganised, with even greater emphasis placed on it in the future. The
company's presence in the US and Japanese markets is to be expanded.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Mercedes-Benz cuts 10,000 jobs
in wake of pay deal
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MERCEDES-BENZ, the automotive subsidiary of Daimler-Benz, the German
engineering group, is responding to the recent 5.8 per cent wage award to
engineering workers by cutting up to 10,000 jobs this year.
According to Mr Werner Niefer, group president, the pay deal will increase
costs this year by DM600m (Dollars 373m). If the company tried to pass this
on by increasing prices, customers would simply buy other makes, he told a
press conference.
Despite a 14 per cent increase in car and commercial vehicle sales during
the first four months of this year - already slackening after the 17 per
cent surge recorded in the first three months - Mr Niefer warned that 'a
fundamental recovery in our most important foreign markets is not yet
discernible'.
The post-unification boom in the German market was also tailing off. Even
so, the company, mainstay of the Daimler-Benz engineering, aerospace and
electronics group, planned to sell 560,000 cars, the same as last year.
The group turnover target was DM70bn, compared with DM67bn in 1991. Profits,
which resisted the general economic downturn last year and matched the
previous year's DM1.5bn result, would again be 'good', according to Mr
Helmut Werner, deputy president.
According to Mr Niefer, the international car market will at best stagnate
in the current year. 'The German market shifted back into normal gear during
the first four months,' he added. As a result, he expected total domestic
registrations to fall by 9 per cent. They were already down 6 per cent at
the end of April.
Indications of a 'hesitant upswing' in other west European countries would
compensate in part for the trend in Germany. The US was more encouraging, Mr
Niefer said. Mercedes sales there, led by the costly S-series and mid-range
cars, rose 18 per cent in the first four months while the overall market
increased only 2 per cent.
The early increase in world sales of commercial vehicles, up 7 per cent in
the first four months to DM102m, is expected to fade later in the year.
Again, falling demand at home is expected to be covered by rises elsewhere.
In the US truck and bus market, which grew 12 per cent in the first four
months, Mercedes increased its sales of heavy-duty lorries by 9 per cent.
Confirming plans to reduce the group's workforce by 20,000 'in the coming
years', Mr Niefer said most would go in Germany, where 183,000 of the total
235,000 workforce is employed.
News of the the loss of between 8,000 and 10,000 his year, following
Tuesday's announcement of a further 850 job cuts at Porsche, and plans for
massive cuts elsewhere in the German automotive industry, indicates
widespread concern at the loss of international competitiveness.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Nordbanken loss grows to
SKr1.97bn in quarter
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
NORDBANKEN, Sweden's state-controlled bank, suffered a SKr1.97bn (Dollars
345m) loss in the first quarter of the year, representing a 13 per cent fall
from the SKr1.745bn loss made for the same period of 1991, writes Robert
Taylor in Stockholm.
The bank said the further deterioration in its performance stemmed from a
deepening of the crisis in financial and property companies, particularly in
Sweden, which had borrowed heavily from the bank.
The total credit losses amounted to SKr3.208bn for the first quarter. The
recent collapse of Coronado, the Swedish property company, occurred after
the end of the first quarter, but would add to the bank's overall losses.
Nordbanken's financial results before credit losses worsened by 19 per cent
in the first quarter to SKr1.238bn from SKr1.752bn for the same period of
1991. Credit loss for the whole of this year is expected to total
SKr6bn-SKr8bn, making it impossible to fulfil its capital adequacy ratio
requirement this year or in 1993, without a strengthening of its capital
base.
In order to rescue the bank from its growing difficulties it was agreed last
month the Swedish state would buy the whole of Nordbanken from its remaining
shareholders and restructure it.

<TEXT>
MR WARREN Buffett, the billionaire investor who rode to the rescue of
Salomon Brothers last summer when the Wall Street securities house was
swamped by a bond trading scandal, yesterday promoted the company's chief
legal counsel, Mr Robert Denham, to succeed him as chairman and chief
executive of the parent group, Salomon Inc.
The 46-year-old Harvard-educated Mr Denham will have responsibility for
overseeing the management of Salomon Brothers and the group's oil refining
and trading operation, Phibro. He will initially work full-time at the
company, but is eventually expected to become a part-time chairman, allowing
him time to continue his work with the California law firm Munger, Tolles &amp;
Olson.
The day-to-day management of the securities arm will be left to Mr Deryck
Maughan, who was appointed chairman and chief executive of Salomon Brothers
last week, just a few days after the firm paid a Dollars 290m fine to the
government to settle charges related to the bond trading affair.
Yesterday's appointment marks the end of a 10-month mission for Mr Buffett,
who was brought in to run Salomon in August 1991 when the previous
management resigned over revelations that the firm's bond trading desk had
rigged several billion-dollar auctions of US government bonds.
Mr Buffett, who steered Salomon through the political storm that erupted in
the wake of the scandal, had always pledged to step down once a settlement
had been reached with the government authorities. He will stay on, however,
as chairman of the executive committee of the Salomon board.
The appointment of Mr Denham surprised Wall Street, which had expected a new
chairman with no previous connections to the securities firm.

FT  04 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ilva's loss jangles nerves of
steel - Haig Simonian on the factors reshaping the industry worldwide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE L498bn (Dollars 410m) loss announced on Tuesday by Ilva shows how deeply
the steel crisis is affecting Europe's third biggest producer, which picked
up the pieces of the Italian state steel industry after Finsider was wound
up in 1988.
Like its big European counterparts, Ilva has been buffeted by weak demand
and depressed prices, just as competition from low-cost eastern Europe and
Third World producers is rising. Meanwhile, costs have climbed steadily.
However, Ilva is more vulnerable than most. Executives claim it has been
unfairly handicapped by the European Commission, which got it off to a bad
start by saddling it with about L3,000bn more in debt than planned.
That, along with later spending on investments and acquisitions, pushed
group borrowings up to L6,300bn by last December. Alter the debt-equity
ratio, and Ilva would be in much better shape, they say.
Prospects for radical surgery to Ilva's balance sheet seem remote.
Government funds have already been restricted by problems at IRI, Ilva's
public-sector parent, which has had to adjust to a drip feed of state cash
because of the country's spiralling budget deficit.
The European Commission is subjecting what government money is coming Ilva's
way to minute examination to test whether it is for restructuring, not aid
in disguise.
Last year's loss also quashed hopes of raising money from private investors.
Under its managing director, Mr Giovanni Gambardella, Ilva has dreamed of a
stock market flotation. However, Italian bourse rules require three
consecutive years of profits before a company can go public. Last year's
loss, which followed net earnings of L115bn in 1990 and L208bn in 1989, has
dashed such plans: Ilva's only hope is for a quotation through the back door
by merging with an already-listed company.
Rationalisation is Ilva's new buzzword. It is focusing on flat products, of
which it is Europe's second biggest producer. Output, concentrated at its
huge Taranto plant in southern Italy, amounted to 8.5m tonnes last year.
Other activities will be sold or spun off into joint ventures. Foremost is
the big integrated steelworks at Piombino in Tuscany. The plant made about
1.5m tonnes of steel in 1990, mostly long products, for which price
competition has been most severe.
Piombino has been hived off into a separate company, and Mr Gambardella
thinks he is now close to a deal to bring in some of Ilva's leading private
sector counterparts as co-shareholders. Executives hope to have a deal by
year-end.
Mr Gambardella argues that the days of empire building for Italy's state
steel industry are over. 'I'd prefer to have 30 per cent of something that's
making money than 100 per cent of something that isn't,' he said last week.
However, critics put many of Ilva's problems squarely at his door.
Encouraged by a buoyant market, it went on a L1,300bn three-year spree of
acquisitions and joint ventures after its birth. With new investments, group
debt has doubled from L3,100bn.
Mr Gambardella defends many of the purchases as essential to protect its
home market at a time of predatory expansion by European rivals, notably
France's Usinor Sacilor. The 1990 alliance with Falck, a Milan steel group
which also specialises in flat products, was driven by the fact that the
French were also eagerly courting the company.
Disposals have become Ilva's top priority. In February, it sold its Capolo
steel cans subsidiary under a complex deal involving a linked merger with a
specialist lithography group. Ilva retained 18 per cent of the amalgam, now
Italy's second-biggest steel packaging group.
Most of Ilva's manoeuvres have involved financial rather than physical
engineering. In a race to generate extraordinary earnings to offset last
year's steelmaking losses, the company reaped L411bn in capital gains by
selling its headquarters building and its 49 per cent stake in a shipping
group.
Using capital gains to increase profits and thus meet bourse requirements
for a listing was derailed by IRI, which was uneasy about a flotation based
on such poor quality earnings, especially when the steel market shows little
sign of picking up.
Mr Gambardella may not have renounced ambitions of bringing Ilva to the
bourse. Another big IRI subsidiary, Finmeccanica, has mapped out its
part-privatisation in November by merging with SIFA, a little-known but
already quoted IRI offshoot. Privately Ilva executives hint they have been
thinking along similar lines.

FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Monarch seeks Pounds 19m to develop
Venezuelan gold mine and mill
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MONARCH RESOURCES, the London-quoted exploration and mining company, is to
raise Pounds 19m net by way of a fully underwritten rights issue of
convertible loan stock, mainly to develop a gold mine and mill at its La
Camorra concession in Venezuela.
Mr Michael Beckett, chairman, said the average cash cost of producing gold
at La Camorra would be about Dollars 115 a troy ounce, making it one of the
world's lowest-cost gold mines.
He said exploration in the area would also be stepped up. Monarch will spend
Dollars 3m (Pounds 1.6m) this year, up from Dollars 800,000 in 1991 and now
has ten geologists on its staff, against three last year.
Monarch also announced yesterday that in 1991 it reduced pre-tax losses from
Dollars 6.3m to Dollars 2.94m. The net loss was down from Dollars 41.8m, or
Dollars 0.455 a share, to Dollars 2.94m, or Dollars 0.206 a share.
The non-interest bearing convertible unsecured loan stock will be issued at
up to 68p per unit on the basis of two units for each ordinary share.
Payment will be in two instalments, the first at 48p. Monarch's shares
closed unchanged at 80p.
Mr Beckett said that a new feasibility study on La Camorra by independent
consultants showed that for an estimated net capital outlay of Dollars
22.95m, at an assumed gold price of Dollars 350 a troy ounce, there was an
indicated rate of return of 41.8 per cent.
Monarch would get its capital outlay back in 1.25 years from the start of
production - projected to be in 1994. The mine would have a life of 4.35
years, with an annual output of 86,000 ounces of gold over the first four
years.
Monarch's biggest shareholder, Mr August von Finck, a German businessman,
has irrevocably agreed to take up his rights and to retain the stock until
payment or cancellation of the second instalment in July next year.
Mr von Fink intends to maintain his shareholding at 23.8 per cent, although,
if no other shareholders took up the issue it might temporarily rise to 44.8
per cent.
The balance of the issue has been underwritten by Leopold Joseph and Sons.
Mr Carl von Rohrer, a Munich-based fund manager, is sub-underwriting the
issue and Monarch will also issue 90,000 shares as a sub-underwriting fee.
Under these arrangements Mr von Rohrer and/or funds under his management
will potentially own up to 29.9 per cent of the increased capital.
Mr von Rohrer and Mr von Finck have confirmed that they are not acting in
concert with each other or any other Monarch shareholder. They have
undertaken that, apart from the rights issue, neither will increase his
interest above 29.9 per cent without making a general offer.

FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Ricardo chief quits after pressure from
directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROGER Smedley has resigned as chairman and chief executive of Ricardo
International, the engineering design group, after pressure from
non-executive directors.
He will be receiving compensation, although the amount is yet to be
negotiated.
The company stressed that Mr Smedley's departure did not reflect any
worsening in group trading, which was satisfactory, although conditions were
difficult.
Mr Christopher Ross, who joined the group in November 1990 and heads one of
the main subsidiaries, will take over as chief executive. Sir Philip
Foreman, a non-executive director for the past six years, is the new
chairman. Mr Matthew Thorne, recruited in May 1991, remains as finance
director.
Mr Ross and Mr Thorne said yesterday that there had been concern over Mr
Smedley combining the two roles, and differences of view over the direction
of the company had arisen.
Mr Smedley became executive chairman in 1990, when Ricardo merged with SAC
International, the company which he co-founded in 1961. He was appointed
chief executive in July last year, but the combination of the roles had not
worked, Ricardo said. Rather than attempt to split the roles again a clean
break was agreed.
Mr Smedley, 57, has a three-year contract at an annual Pounds 108,000.
However, it is thought his compensation will be less than three times his
salary.
The group now has two executive and two non-executive directors. Further
appointments will be made in due course.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AVONMORE FOODS, the Irish dairy and meat processing group, yesterday
announced the acquisition of Harzland Fleisch Service, a German fresh meat
sales and distribution business.
The purchase price is IPounds 6m (Pounds 5.48m) cash. Harzland is located
close to the former East German border and is Avonmore's first acquisition
on the Continent.
Mr Pat O'Neill, managing director, described the move as 'an important step
in our strategy to develop a manufacturing presence in continental Europe.
It provides Avonmore Foods with an important base in the strongest EC
economy and the major European market for pigmeat'.
Harzland's turnover in 1991 was IPounds 56.5m with pre-tax profits of
IPounds 1.43m. Its disclosed net assets are IPounds 1.32m.
Payment for Harzland is to be phased over two years. An additional IPounds
1.59m may be paid in 1995, depending upon improved profitability targets
being met up to December 1994, and 15 per cent of any profits in excess of
those targets will be paid in addition, according to Mr Brendan Graham,
group secretary.
Avonmore has grown rapidly through acquisition since it was established in
1988, turnover increasing from IPounds 263m in 1987 to IPounds 575m last
year.
It recently moved into the red meat market with the acquisition of four meat
processing plants in the west of Ireland.
The plants were formerly owned by United Meat Packers, which went into
receivership earlier this year. The four UMP plants together process 10 per
cent of Ireland's cattle kill and 25 per cent of its sheep kill.
Mr Graham said that the German acquisition 'is a strategic investment as a
base and bridgehead for further growth in Europe and will assist in the
development of our exports'.

FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: High cost of bidding for Jubilee line
extension
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSTRUCTION companies estimate that they have spent at least Pounds 50m to
prepare bids to build the Pounds 1.7bn extension to the Jubilee Underground
which has been threatened by the decision to place the Canary Wharf office
development into receivership.
Bids have already been submitted for most of the 10 mile extension.
London Transport has already identified an all-Italian consortium led by
Italstrade as being likely to win the contract for the 2 1/2 mile section
between Canary Wharf and Canada Water on the south bank of the Thames.
Contractors are concerned about the potential waste of money spent on
preparing bids as well as the possible loss of such a large project when
construction order books are already at a low ebb.
Construction work at Canary Wharf itself has halted while construction
companies negotiate with the development's administrators over Pounds 60m of
payments and retentions which are thought to be owed by Olympia &amp; York to
contractors.
Part of a contract payment is normally retained by developers for up to 12
months against the possibility of defects emerging after a building has been
completed. Retentions can represent between 2 1/2 per cent to 5 per cent of
the building cost.
Bovis, Trafalgar House and Mowlem are among contractors still owed money
under retention agreements. The companies say, however, that the sums are
small by comparison with the scale of their total construction business.
Smaller companies owed money by Olympia &amp; York are in a much more difficult
position. Several of these could be at risk if payments are not forthcoming
according to some contractors working at Canary Wharf.
Olympia &amp; York, however, was a prompt payer and was thought to have been
up-to-date with progress payments before the development went into
administrative receivership.
Larger contractors, although concerned about money owed on Canary Wharf, are
more worried about the possible loss of the Jubilee Line extension.
The government has said that the project will not go ahead unless any future
owner of the development meets Olympia &amp; York's commitment to provide Pounds
400m towards the cost of the extension. This would involve an initial
tranche of Pounds 100m paid almost immediately with the remaining Pounds
300m paid over 20 to 25 years.

Net revenue for the half year to end-April fell to Pounds 62,000 (Pounds

FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: NFC plans new share scheme to boost
employee ownership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NFC, the transport, freight and distribution company, is to offer its
workers an innovative package of incentives to buy shares as part of a drive
to prevent its level of employee ownership from falling below 45 per cent.
Mr James Watson, chairman, believes the continuing UK recession is partly to
blame for the fall in employee share ownership. When he announces the
interim figures on June 17 he will warn that there are no tangible signs
that the recession is coming to an end.
For the first time since the company was floated on the Stock Exchange in
1989 employees are to receive one bonus share for every share purchased plus
an option to buy a further share.
Mr Watson said: 'The normal practice of UK companies is to offer options to
executives only, but that is not NFC's culture which is based on everyone in
the business being able to share in its success.'
Managers will have to make an investment up front in NFC before they are
granted options.
The new scheme, approved at an extraordinary meeting on Saturday, will
replace the existing share saving programme which offered employees two free
shares for every five purchased.
Mr Watson said it was designed to prevent the level of shares held by
employees and their families from falling below 45 per cent.
Since 1989 the level of shares held by solely by employees fell from 30 per
cent to 19 per cent.
Mr Watson hopes that the new scheme, which will come into effect next year,
will account for the bulk of profits set aside for profit sharing. A maximum
of 15 per cent of the profits may be put aside for profit sharing, although
the annual figure depends on the performance of the company.
Last year employees received about 120 free shares from profit sharing. The
new scheme is designed to give a greater reward to those who save for
shares.
Mr Watson said: 'The new share schemes are essential if we are to maintain
into the 21st century the high level of employee share ownership.'

FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Interest income helps VSEL rise 18%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A TREBLING of interest income on a fast growing pile of cash helped VSEL
Consortium, the nuclear submarine builder, to increase pre-tax profit by 18
per cent in the year to March 31.
Reassuring news on the fourth Trident submarine, the next class of
submarine, and on Ministry of Defence acceptance for a howitzer design
helped push the shares up 36p to 454p.
The pre-tax profit advance from Pounds 40.7m to Pounds 47.9m came on flat
turnover of Pounds 520m (Pounds 523m) and in spite of a near Pounds 6m drop
in profit from the non-submarine business.
Trading profit inched ahead to Pounds 38.1m (Pounds 37.5m), while net
interest income soared to Pounds 9.8m (Pounds 3.2m).
A cash inflow of Pounds 50.5m brought the total amount held to Pounds
201.8m. Mr Noel Davies, chief executive, said net cash stood at just over
Pounds 100m.
The inflow had been achieved by successful management of the Trident
submarine contract. He said the placing of the order for the fourth Trident
was expected within the next few weeks. This would bring the order book to
Pounds 4bn.
Its Pounds 6m study contract for the Batch 2 Trafalgar Class submarine would
put it in a good position to be prime contractor later in the decade.
The submarine division made Pounds 41.8m (Pounds 40.2m) profit on sales of
Pounds 390m (Pounds 421m). A small amount of conventional submarine work is
still taking place at the Cammell Laird yard on Merseyside.
The group provided for the yard's closure and losses in last year's Pounds
125m extraordinary charge. This was also to cover a near halving of the
workforce at the Barrow-in-Furness submarine yard from 14,000 two years ago
to between 7,000 and 8,000 by 1995.
Other activities, including the self-propelled howitzer and work for the
off-shore industry, made only Pounds 600,000, down from Pounds 6.5m, on
sales of Pounds 130m (Pounds 101m).
Earnings per share rose to 82.4p (74.1p) and a proposed final dividend of
17p (15.5p) makes a total of 25p (22.5p).
COMMENT
VSEL's low p/e rating - less than 5 prospectively - and high yield is
testimony to the fright investors have taken at the defence industry. Its
millstones have been its 90 per cent dependence on the shrinking UK defence
budget and its nuclear submarine niche, which caused a panic in the days
when Labour was expected to win the election. It is worth remembering that
the proposed 6 per cent reduction in defence spending over three years still
leaves annual procurement at the best part of Pounds 9bn. Meanwhile, its
monopoly of nuclear submarines is a plus, it has a chance of getting back
into ship-building and the howitzer project and off-shore start-ups are
nearer to making profits. That said, the group remains rather hamstrung by
Barrow. It seems to feel it cannot acquire elsewhere while it is cuting jobs
there and the chances of its political plea for government aid to bring in
new employers must be marred by the barriers to building roads and railways
in the Lake District. Pre-tax profit is forecast to rise to about Pounds
53m, the prospective yield is more than 8 per cent and it has more cash than
its market value. For those not frightened by defence it remains reasonable
value.

LEICA, the precision optical and scientific instruments group which Mr

year, is discussing the sale of a majority stake in Leica Camera, its camera
making subsidiary.
At least two potential buyers have approached the Swiss-based company. One
is a group of investors including Mr Bruno Frey, managing director of Leica
Camera's German manufacturing operations. The other is an unnamed American
distributor of photographic equipment.
Mr Fritz Staudacher, head of corporate communications, said the company had
decided to concentrate on its optical and scientific business and seek a
partner to invest in and develop the camera subsidiary.
'But we are not forced to do it. We will only take a partner if we are
convinced it will work,' he said. No details on price or what size of stake,
if any, Leica would retain in the subsidiary have been released.
Leica Camera has manufacturing plants in Germany and Portugal, a sales
network in Europe and the US, and rights to the Leica Camera brand.
Unotec, Leica's ultimate holding company, would retain the brand name for
the non-camera businesses.
In the 1991, the latest year for which results are available, Leica Camera
made operating profits of Pounds 2.64m from sales of Pounds 63.8m.
Microscopes, scientific and surveying instruments made combined profits of
Pounds 13.2m from sales of Pounds 455.8m.

FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Restructured St James's Place Capital moves
ahead from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 18.4m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX PROFITS at St James's Place Capital, the dealing and investment
business chaired by Lord Rothschild, rose from Pounds 4.3m to Pounds 18.4m
over the year to March 31.
The company was created by a demerger of J Rothschild Holdings in 1990, and
has been used as a vehicle for corporate finance work by Lord Rothschild.
Much of the profit increase came from the sale of Bishopsgate Progressive
Unit Trust Management, to J Rothschild Assurance which brought in a profit
of Pounds 4.9m.
There has been extensive restructuring - investment income declined from
Pounds 24.7m to Pounds 13.4m, while fund management income increased from
Pounds 5.1m to Pounds 8.3m.
The final is 1.5p. Net asset value per share rose from 91.7p to 95.5p over
the year.

FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Unilever announces review to improve head
office operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNILEVER, the multi-national consumer products group, yesterday told its
1,800 head office staff of an extensive review of the corporate centre's
workings.
The review is expected to lead to job losses, although the company said
yesterday it was too early to say how many or in which areas.
The group divides its head office between London, with 1,200 people, and
Rotterdam, where 600 are employed. Both offices will be maintained, Unilever
said. It added that the process was not merely a cost-cutting exercise.
The aim was to ensure that the head office was providing essential services
to the operating units in the most cost effective way.
The head office would be adapted to provide direction to the businesses into
the next century, the group said.
The review follows the succession of Mr Michael Perry to co-chairman last
month, following the retirement of Sir Michael Angus. It also follows
changes within many of the group's operations, such as the rationalisation
of the European food business in preparation for the single market, and the
unification of some of the detergent operations which had been organised on
a national basis.
The group has already decided to concentrate on four main areas - food,
personal products such as toothpaste and shampoo, detergents, and speciality
chemicals. It wants to look at each area on a more international basis.
Each department in the head office will make proposals for its future
organisation.
These recommendations are expected to be completed by the year end and after
consultations, implementation should begin early next year, although it will
be carried out department by department.

FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dowty and TI in war of words
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWTY GROUP, the aero-space and information technology company, began the
last week of its defence against the hostile takeover bid from TI by
accusing its suitor of under-estimating Dowty's ability to recover from the
recession.
In a circular to shareholders Dowty also said that if shareholders accepted
the TI offer their income would fall by 41 per cent, due to the lower yield
on TI shares.
TI immediately dismissed the circular, saying Dowty's higher-than-expected
Pounds 29m profit estimate for the year to March 1992 was well within the
range anticipated before the bid.
A TI adviser also said Dowty's argument about yield took no account of the
potential capital gain from holding TI shares and that shareholders should
consider their total return on investment.
'This latest statement from Dowty is a damp squib,' TI said. TI said its
offer valued Dowty at a multiple of 30 this year's estimated profits.
TI's shares rose 12p to 357p, partly in sympathy with the rise in the share
price of Siebe, the engineering group. Dowty's shares rose 3p to 176p, above
the 175p per share value of the cash alternative.
In its circular Dowty said it saw little or no premium in the price offered
by TI. Management had already taken much of the action that TI said it would
take and that it had a different management from that which had put Dowty
into its difficulties.
TI has consistently rejected this argument.

FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Put back in its place by a parent - David
Barchard on the turnround at Marine Midland / The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE YEARS ago Marine Midland, the US subsidiary of Hongkong Bank, was an
ambitious money centre bank battling against a hostile environment.
Today it has settled down to something more like its his-torical origins as
a regional niche player, back in profit and relying on retail banking and
small businesses in its home state.
In between lies a period when the bank lost nearly half a billion dollars in
two years and Hongkong Bank was obliged to pour in top management and new
capital to nurse it back to financial health.
For Hongkong Bank, now battling with Lloyds in a Pounds 3.9bn bid for
Midland Bank of the UK, the experience shows the pitfalls of entering a new
market and leaving things to local management.
It also suggests however that, faced with a seriously troubled subsidiary,
Hongkong Bank has the management capacity to make a swift and successful
response.
'We are now well capitalised, generously reserved, and very liquid,' says Mr
Keith Whitson, executive director.
Hongkong Bank's connection with Marine Midland, which has no historical
connection with its UK namesake, dates back to 1978.
Traditionally Marine Midland had been a large and rather conservative New
York State regional bank with 316 branches, established in the second half
of the last century and based in Buffalo near the Great Lakes in the north
east of the state.
At the end of the 1970s Marine Midland hankered after diversification into
more exciting activities such as investment banking and lending to
developing countries without having the necessary capital base to do so.
When Hongkong Bank bought 51 per cent of its equity, while agreeing to leave
its board and management in place for at least five years, Marine Midland
seemed on course for its planned diversification.
Things went well for most of the 1980s. In 1987 Hongkong bought the
remaining 49 per cent of Marine Midland's stock.
Two years later, lending mistakes made during the 1980s came home to roost.
Provi-sions for loan losses climbed to Dollars 414.3m, rising to Dollars
557.3m the following year. A Dollars 13.8m profit in 1989 became a horrific
loss of Dollars 295.6m in 1990. Things were not much better in 1991 when the
bank lost Dollars 189.9m.
Marine Midland was one of three loss-making subsidiaries in the group, the
others being Hongkong Bank of Australia and James Capel, its London
stockbroker.
The subsequent turnaround has been achieved partly by putting in top
management from the rest of the group, a process which culminated in the
appointment in June 1991 of Mr John Bond, a Hongkong Bank main board
director, as president and chief executive officer in place of Mr Geoffrey
Thompson. In October 1991, Hongkong Bank injected Dollars 200m in new
capital.
The strategy behind the turn around involved a drastic change in the bank's
business areas and the shrinking of its loan book.
Key points in the strategy were:
Falling back on Marine Midland's traditional core business in retail banking
and lending to medium and small businesses in New York state;
Cutting costs
Withdrawing from more than a dozen activities including motor finance,
national real estate lending, international private banking, equipment
leasing, and leveraged buy-outs.
Reducing developing country debt exposure. Marine Midland's developing
country debt portfolio shrank from Dollars 1.13bn at the end of 1989 to
about Dollars 17.1m early this year.
By the beginning of 1992, light was beginning to show at the end of the
tunnel. Losses in the final quarter of the year were Dollars 23.8m, compared
to Dollars 164.3m in the last quarter of 1990. In the first quarter of this
year Marine Midland reported earnings of Dollars 2.6m up from losses of
Dollars 72.3m in that period in 1991.
One result of all this is that Marine Midland is now a smaller but cleaner
bank with a strong capital base. Total assets have fallen from Dollars
27.06bn in 1989 to Dollars 16.94bn at the end of last year, while its total
loan book is down from Dollars 22.67bn in 1989 to Dollars 10.48bn at
present.
Staff numbers have been trimmed from 13,538 at the start of 1990 to 10,450
two years later.
With the bank back in profit, the shrinking process is now over. What is
left is a bank which relies almost entirely on retail deposits for its
funding and only slightly on wholesale funds.
Having devoted so much time on it, Marine Midland's parent will now
presumably want to sit back and enjoy some of the rewards.
In the longer term, there may be a question about the exact role an up-state
regional bank, albeit one based in the retail finance activities in which
the Hongkong Group is also a specialist, has inside a global bank.

FT  04 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Siebe beats City hopes with Pounds 170m -
Chief executive expected to step down before the year-end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BARRIE Stephens, the chairman who led the transformation of Siebe, the
engineering concern, into one of the world's leading controls manufacturers,
is expected to step down as chief executive before the end of the year.
Mr Stephens, while announcing a better-than-expected 7 per cent advance in
pre-tax profits to Pounds 169.6m for the year to April 4, said yesterday
that his successor was in place, but has not yet been named.
Although Mr Stephens did not specify his future role, he said: 'If the board
considers me to be of use then I'll stick around . . . If they think (not)
then I'll go play golf.'
City analysts dismissed the possibility that Mr Stephens - whose energetic
management style and ruthlessness have been responsible for a six-year
growth in sales from Pounds 370m to Pounds 1.6bn - would enjoy the latter
alternative.
It has been suggested that Mr Alan Yurko, head of the controls division  -
which includes Foxboro, the US controls group purchased in 1990 - would
become chief executive, with Mr Stephens staying on as non-executive
chairman.
The recovery of Foxboro, and of the US economy, were the key elements in
last year's buoyant results. The market, which had been expecting a marginal
rise to Pounds 160m, subsequently marked the shares up 12p to 739p at the
close.
US sales in the fourth quarter were especially buoyant, with parts of the
controls division showing a 6 per cent advance on the previous year.
Mr Stephens said they remained 'encouragingly ahead'. Sales for the group as
a whole rose 10 per cent to Pounds 1.6bn.
Siebe reduced staff by almost 2,400 people, bringing the total to 32,000.
Redundancy costs and severance pay had sliced Pounds 6.6m from the bottom
line, Mr Stephens said.
He pointed out that Siebe remained on target for reducing gearing to the
'mid-50s' by August 1993.
Cost-cutting and control of working capital had helped to cut gearing from
98.1 per cent to 78.8 per cent.
Interest payments, however, rose from Pounds 48.9m to Pounds 63.5m due to
the inclusion of Foxboro for a full 12 months, compared with seven months
last time.
Mr Stephens was unapologetic about Siebe's practice of capitalising
intangible assets - mainly software development. 'You have to attribute to
the balance sheet the value of intellectual property,' he said. The
'intelligent' controls market was the way of the future, he added. 'If you
are not intelligent you might as well stay home and die.'
During the year, Siebe capitalised Pounds 27m of software development, while
depreciation charges came to Pounds 24m.
The controls division increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 93.6m to Pounds
117.5m, on sales Pounds 172.6m ahead at Pounds 1.1bn.
Foxboro contributed Pounds 13m (Pounds 500,000) in profits after all
financing obligations, Mr Stephens said, while gross margins there had risen
by 10 percentage points to 45 per cent. The costs of restructuring the US
company totalled Pounds 29.6m (Pounds 39.9m) and were expected to come to
about Pounds 15m this year.
Compressed air saw taxable profits halve from Pounds 24.3m to Pounds 12.1m.
The division had been the 'most ravaged by recession' with its main
customers in the severely depressed mining industry.
Specialist mechanical engineering saw pre-tax profits fall by Pounds 1.8m to
Pounds 11.9m, while safety and life support fell from Pounds 25m to Pounds
23.4m pre-tax. Property profits rose from Pounds 2.5m to Pounds 4.7m.
Earnings per share rose from 46.1p to 47.6p. The final dividend is increased
to 12.1p for an 18.15p (16.5p) total.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Payout cut hits Sturge shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STURGE HOLDINGS, the biggest agency group on the Lloyd's of London insurance
market, saw more than a third of its market capitalisation disappear
yesterday morning after adverse reaction to a dividend policy change.
Sturge, which like Lloyd's is chaired by Mr David Coleridge, cut its interim
dividend by 50 per cent to 2.75p. Pre-tax profits fell to Pounds 2.58m
(Dollars 4.62m) from Pounds 3.70m in the six months to March 31, 1992.
The group is one of two agencies at Lloyd's with a full London listing. The
other is AJ Archer, which last week also reported a fall in pre-tax profits.
Sturge warned shareholders to expect a final dividend of 5.5p, down from
11p.
The shares plunged 65p to 105p on the news, before recovering marginally to
close at 111p.
Mr Peter Davis, deputy chairman, said he was 'disappointed' by the reaction
but said the stock market had 'regarded Sturge as a yield stock and the
decision was bound to be adverse'.
Operating income fell to Pounds 802,000 from Pounds 1.16m, following a rise
in expenses to Pounds 11.4m from Pounds 11.07m. Interest and other income
fell to Pounds 1.78m against Pounds 2.54m.
The group said it expected pre-tax profits for the year as a whole to be not
less than Pounds 7.5m compared with Pounds 19.12 (before the write-off of
deferred expenditure last year).
Analysts expect profits commission earned on the 1989 underwriting year,
which will be reported in the second half, to shrink to around Pounds 5m,
compared with Pounds 14m last year.
Sturge has reassessed underwriting prospects for 1990 and 1991 and said it
would take longer than expected for group profits to return to previous
levels.
Sturge syndicates have had to provide bigger-than-expected reserves for
future losses in areas such as stop-loss insurance (which provides
reinsurance for individual Names) and errors and omissions covers (which
meet the cost of legal awards for agents' negligence). Investment returns
were also down.

FT  04 JUN 92 / BAe ousts Royal Ordnance executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and RICHARD DONKIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE has removed the managing director of Royal Ordnance, its
armaments subsidiary, in a move revealing further sharp divergences within
the group about its business strategies.
Mr Peter Kenyon, who had headed Royal Ordnance for three-and-a-half years,
has been replaced by Mr David Parry, formerly engineering director of
British Aerospace Defence, the company formed this year to pool all BAe's
military interests.
The Royal Ordnance board was told when it was summoned for a meeting on
Monday by Mr John Weston, chairman of BAe Defence. The move is believed to
have stemmed from growing irritation at BAe's headquarters over Mr Kenyon's
independent approach.
It continues a series of top management upsets at BAe, following Professor
Sir Roland Smith's resignation as chairman last September amid a row over
the handling of a Pounds 432m rights issue. The latest upheaval comes just a
month after Mr John Cahill, a former chief executive of the BTR industrial
conglomerate, took over as the new BAe chairman.
Mr Kenyon's removal took colleagues at Royal Ordnance by surprise. One
executive described the atmosphere in the company as 'a bit like a pithead
disaster'. BAe however described the move yesterday as 'a routine management
change'. It said Mr Kenyon remained employed by the group and was awaiting
re-appointment to another job.
Royal Ordnance has shown clear discomfort at BAe's efforts to integrate its
defence operations, seeking to preserve its own identity and commercial
standing. After BAe's flopped rights issue, its management sought to
distance the company from the well-publicised problems of the parent group.
Mr Kenyon was known to be keen on building up Royal Ordnance's position as
supplier of a wide range of army equipment including military vehicles.
In April the company bought BMARC, a producer of guns and ammunition
belonging to the Astra Holdings group, which had gone into receivership. The
deal, understood to have involved a payment of just under Pounds 10m, is
being studied by the Office of Fair Trading.

FT  04 JUN 92 / EC to investigate Du Pont purchase of ICI nylon side
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN, ANDREW HILL and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, BRUSSELS, NEW YORK.
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Commission is to investigate the proposed acquisition by Du
Pont, the US chemicals company, of Imperial Chemical Industries' nylon
business because the deal may distort competition in the market for nylon
carpet fibres.
The investigation will take up to four months and follows a four-week
preliminary inquiry.
Both companies yesterday said they were confident that the commission would
eventually allow the transaction to go ahead. ICI said: 'While not
unexpected it is unfortunate. It will add to the uncertainty felt by
employees and customers.'
The sale is part of an agreement made in April under which ICI would receive
Pounds 250m in cash and Du Pont's acrylics business in exchange for its
nylon operations. The agreement called for the deal to be completed by the
end of the year. ICI said yesterday this was still the target.
However, if the commission is still not happy about the agreement after its
four-month inquiry, it could outlaw the deal or ask the companies to amend
it, for example by selling overlapping parts of the business.
Since EC merger regulations came into force in September 1990, 93 deals have
been notified to the commission's merger task force, of which only six have
gone into the second-phase four-month inquiry. Of those six, only one - last
year's Franco-Italian bid for De Havilland, the Canadian aircraft-maker -
has been blocked outright.
US anti-trust regulators open inquiries this month. If the deal does go
ahead, Du Pont would become the largest manufacturer of nylon in western
Europe, with 30 per cent of capacity.
Its main European competitor would be the new 50:50 joint venture between
Rhone-Poulenc of France and Snia of Italy, with about 25 per cent of
capacity.
The industry has been forced to consolidate because nylon sales have been
hit by the world slowdown in construction - most is used in carpets.
However, its problems go back to the early 1970s, since when it has lost
market share especially in clothing to another artificial fibre, polyester.
ICI nylon operations have sales of about Pounds 600m annually and 6,100
employees in the UK, Germany and the Netherlands. By swapping nylon for
acrylics, ICI distances itself from the textiles industry and concentrates
on mainstream chemicals.

FT  04 JUN 92 / A recipe for success in the office canteen: Contract
caterers are looking to the public sector for fresh growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN years ago when a UK worker tucked into a meal in the canteen, the
chances were that it had been cooked and served by fellow employees. Now
more than half the canteens in the business sector are run by contractors
and the opening of the door to the public sector has set up a mouth-watering
prospect.
The growth of the contractors' role in providing the 3bn-plus meals a year
that Britons consume at work and in schools, hospitals and prisons helps to
explain why Compass Group outbid some serious competition, including a
management buy-out team, to set up the acquisition of its rival, Gardner
Merchant.
At present, Compass's shares are suspended while details are worked out of
the Pounds 500m to Pounds 550m purchase from Forte, the hotels and
restaurants group. Compass plans to buy the bulk of Forte's contract
catering division for Pounds 450m, with ARA Services of the US taking the
rest.
Compass will become the market leader with as much as 37 per cent of the
corporate contract catering market. ARA will leapfrog from fourth to second
with an estimated 20 per cent, ahead of Sutcliffe, part of P&amp;O, with about
18 per cent. The swallowing of Gardner means the top four become the top
three.
Rivals of Compass will expect the Office of Fair Trading to take a keen
interest in the new combination. Compass has already discussed the issue
with the OFT, however, and brought ARA into the deal to try to avoid
competition problems.
The merger's impact depends on how you define the market. Gardner and
Compass have more than half the business sector that is contracted out, but
that in turn is only half the Pounds 1.5bn whole and in-house caterers are
part of the competition.
If public sector canteens are included, the contractors' penetration comes
down to only 15 per cent, according to figures from Gira Sic, the
independent consultancy.
In business catering, the contractors' share has nearly doubled in 10 years,
enabling Gardner, Compass and Sutcliffe to keep profits moving ahead. But
growth has started to flag, according to a recent report from analysts at
Hoare Govett.
The closing of sites and redundancies have affected the operators and
unemployment could prove a drag until 1994.
Clients under financial pressure may wish to strike a harder bargain with
the outside caterer, for instance by asking for more of the savings to be
passed on. The traditional cost-plus contract in the UK has enabled groups
like Compass to retain much of the discount achieved in buying materials, as
well as taking the management fee represented by the 'plus'.
In continental Europe, payment is more likely to be based on agreed prices
for the meals, leaving the contractor with less predictability.
Foreign competition, particularly from France, is becoming more of a threat.
Hoare Govett says the UK is the only major European country in which foreign
operators have not taken a significant market share.
Mr Michael Jones, of Gira Sic, points to two culture clashes. One is the
cost-plus versus the fixed-price approach. The other is British eating
habits. In the more snack-orientated UK, staff canteens are used by less
than 40 per cent of employees, while on the continent the take-up is at
least 55 per cent. So far the presence in the UK of the French groups -
Sodexho, Eurest and the contract catering division of Accor - has remained
tiny, but most commentators believe this will change.
Compass's catering business is far more dependent on the UK corporate sector
than Gardner's. It risks a loss of momentum - unless it expands overseas and
takes on more muscle for an assault on the public sector.
Gardner is ahead of it on both counts. About Pounds 230m of its Pounds 800m
turnover last year was overseas. It is market leader in the Netherlands and
has significant shares in France, Belgium and Germany. After several years
of investment, it has critical mass in these markets; each new contract is
much more profitable than those signed in the start-up years.
In the UK public sector, where only about 6 per cent of a Pounds 3bn-plus
market is contracted out, Gardner is the biggest private operator. About a
quarter of its new contracts are with institutions rather than companies.
While the Forte deal will enable Compass to progress on all the most
promising fronts, will it pay too much?
The business it is buying with ARA made Pounds 47m operating profit on
Pounds 1.13bn sales last year. Using the standard 33 per cent tax rate, the
Pounds 500m-Pounds 550m price tag is 16 to 17 times resilient earnings, on a
par with the FT-A 500-share index but higher than Compass's 15 times rating.
And with a planned share issue of less than Pounds 200m, the group will end
up with net debt of roughly Pounds 300m.
Mr Francis Mackay, Compass's chief executive, stresses the scope for margin
improvement, particularly on purchasing, and says his group - once a heavily
indebted management buy-out - has shown it can reduce debt. He contrasts
Compass's operating margin of 9.2 per cent with Gardner's figure of around 4
per cent, while analysts also credit his group with tight financial
controls. Another factor is that Compass's purchase will include the
higher-margin airport services operation. There is a suggestion that the
comparison of operating margins is not straightforward because Gardner
calculates its sales figures in a different way.
Mr Mackay has obviously decided the opportunity warrants stretching Compass.
Whether he is right will depend on the new group's success on the
battlefields for future growth: the UK public sector and the continent of
Europe.

FT  04 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Reed International
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Although Reed International's full-year figures came as an agreeable
surprise to the market yesterday, they were reassuring only up to a point.
It is five years since Reed embarked on its grand strategic plan of turning
itself into a pure publisher. Shorn of the benefits of its pensions holiday,
its earnings per share are now lower in nominal terms than they were then.
Granted, the underlying increase of some 10 per cent in second half pre-tax
profits is in welcome contrast to the first half fall of 22 per cent. But it
remains faintly unsettling that Reed should still be dependent on
advertising for more than 40 per cent of its revenue. While its advertising
prices have broadly kept pace with inflation in the past couple of years,
advertising volume in that time is down nearly 20 per cent. Whatever the
merits of the strategy, they evidently do not include immunity from the
cycle.
Then again, the more cyclical the stock, the greater the potential. This
doubtless accounts for the fact that at yesterday's 580p, the shares are on
a historic multiple of almost 20 and a yield of only 3.7 per cent. Although
Reed is very cautious about the scope for an upturn in its markets, it
remains wedded to the theory that the world publishing industry is due for
further consolidation. With its relatively strong balance sheet, it is
certainly in a position to take advantage of any asset reshuffling still due
from the excesses of the late 1980s. The question is perhaps whether, in the
post-Maxwell era, the market is ready for another turn on the publishing
merry-go-round.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Those Names persuaded to sweat it out rather than resign their Lloyd's
membership may be having second thoughts. Yesterday not only brought news
that Chatset, an independent analyst, had raised its forecast of the
market's losses for the 1989 underwriting account from Pounds 1.4bn to more
than Pounds 2bn. In a perhaps more alarming development the quoted managing
agency group Sturge Holdings said 1990 would be up only modestly on the
previous year.
Sturge's results for the 12 months to September will reflect its 1989
income. But it was the group's gloomy comments on the outlook for subsequent
years - and the consequent halving of a dividend investors previously hoped
it could maintain - which caused yesterday's 35 per cent fall in the shares.
The problem is not just lower commission as underwriting losses continue
into 1990. Sturge will be hit in 1993 and 1994 by a reduction in the fixed
charges it levies on Names and by new deficit charges designed better to
reflect the impact of bad years in the agency's overall rewards. In the long
run these changes are meant to give Names a fairer deal. The question is how
many will be around to benefit.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
If nothing else, Siebe's full-year figures are confirmation of the striking
success of the Foxboro acquisition. In little more than 18 months, Siebe has
taken Foxboro from persistent losses to operating margins of almost 17 per
cent. In its first full year, it has contributed a net Pounds 13m to cash
flow after all expenses. Partly as a result, the group as a whole has more
than retrieved the drop in earnings at the interim stage. Although business
in the current year has proved a touch disappointing, Siebe continues to
expect a second-half upturn.
However impressive it is that Foxboro should already be at a pitch of
efficiency, the obvious question is how far the shares can now go on
outperforming. At 739p, the multiple is a touch below the UK industrial
average, but so is the yield. Siebe is fully established as a remarkable
company. It may be due for a lull just the same.

FT  04 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: The Danish blues
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The reaction in European markets to Denmark's rejection of the Maastricht
Treaty was one of predictable alarm. The D-Mark strengthened within the ERM
and bond prices in high interest currencies slid sharply. The rationale in
both cases is that the swing vote of a few thousand Danes has diverted
Europe away from monetary union and back to currency fluctuations and
diverging inflation rates.
But has it? Part of the answer depends on how far the motivation behind the
ERM has been ideological rather than pragmatic. If governments saw the
system as a precursor of a currency union ordained by history, it now stands
a large chance of breaking down. If, on the other hand, the main
justification for ERM membership was a simple desire to fight inflation by
linking up with the D-Mark, the markets have less to fear than yesterday's
reaction suggests. There will be no immediate crack in the system, inflation
will remain under pressure and bond yields can continue to fall.
Ironically, Denmark itself, which can actually meet the Maastricht
convergence criteria, is almost certainly in the latter camp. So is the UK.
Less clear is the position of France. Were its voters also to reject the
treaty, the foundations of the ERM would almost certainly crumble, which
perhaps explains why the French bond market took such fright yesterday. But
as long as Mr Pierre Beregovoy is prime minister, there seems little chance
of a let-up in the strong franc policy which has produced France's exemplary
inflation record.
There is thus a chance that calm will return to European bond markets as
they regain their faith in the ERM. But investors in national markets may
require a slightly wider premium over German government bonds than in the
recent past, The lira, which has been sustained by little else than Italian
commitment to monetary union, will remain under pressure.
Danish bonds were already recovering from their lows by yesterday lunchtime.
Maybe that should tell the gilts market that its fall, which saw the long
gilt future drop by over a point, was overdone. Worry that the UK would be
unable to attract sufficient inflows to fund the PSBR spilt over into the
equity market as well. The UK government's funding problem, however, is one
more reason why the UK is unlikely to abandon the ERM now. Indeed, continued
pressure on sterling would create an argument for moving promptly to narrow
bands - a fitting start to the UK's EC presidency during which the Major
government will have to clear up the Maastricht mess.

Sir, In February Barclays suggested that we consider transferring our

It appears that these terms are slightly worse than those enjoyed by Paul

FT  04 JUN 92 / Letter: US federal assets and privatisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof STEVE H HANKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Martin Dickson's article, 'America's sale of the century' (June 1),
contains some errors that require correction. First, Mr Dickson asserts that
the federal government, apart from a few odds and ends, owns very few real
assets. Not true. About one third of the land in the US is owned by the
federal government. That area is about 12.5 times larger than the entire
surface of the UK.
Mr Dickson's second error concerns his characterisation of the US as being a
bit slow in warming to privatisation. Indeed, he claims that the US is
'roughly a decade behind Britain'. Also not true. As a senior economist on
president Reagan's council of economic advisers, I was responsible for the
president's privatisation portfolio, and fired the first public shot on that
topic in a December 1981 speech. President Reagan followed up in his budget
message for the fiscal year 1983, when he stated that 'we will move
systematically to reduce the vast holdings of surplus land . . .' That
budget message also indicated that Dollars 9bn worth of lands would be
privatised within three years.
President Reagan's proposal was stopped in its tracks by many of the
environmental ideologues who are gathered this week in Rio. This is
unfortunate, since the federally-owned lands are much less productive and in
worse shape, from an environmental point of view, than comparable private
lands.
Last week, while I was dining with Prof Milton Friedman in Mexico City, Prof
Friedman offered a suggestion worth considering: given the despoliation left
by public ownership throughout the world, what we really need isn't an Earth
Summit, but rather a Privatisation Summit.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Letter: Britain's trade deficits should surely be a matter
of concern
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Dr JOHN WELLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Samuel Brittan professes ('Countries don't go broke', June 1) a lack of
concern over the latest UK trade statistics, which, in April, recorded a
deficit in non-oil visible trade - his preferred measure - of Pounds 1.46bn.
This number, though receiving considerable media attention (perhaps now that
the general election is safely out of the way]), was not vastly out of line
with the monthly average deficit for this year of Pounds 1.2bn, or Pounds
15bn annually.
But concern surely is in order when, at a similar stage in the economic
cycle during all previous post-Second World War recessions, a depressed
level of domestic spending has been sufficient, by curtailing imports and
permitting exportables to be switched from home to overseas markets, to
ensure substantial surpluses in visible trade.
The continuing deterioration in the UK's relative economic performance, as
evidenced by the worsening internal-external balance trade-off, is such that
the level of domestic spending now required to get unemployment down from
the rapidly-approaching 3m mark to a more humane figure of, say, 0.5m would,
for a given (current) level of demand in the rest of the world, probably be
associated with current account deficits of around 10 per cent of GDP. And I
cannot think Samuel Brittan believes that to be the real rate of return on
the UK's overseas assets] Moreover, those who profess concern at current
structural weaknesses in the UK economy cannot be so easily dismissed, as
his reference to Gosplan is presumably meant to suggest, as advocates of a
siege economy.
Such a thoroughly unfair trivialisation of his opponents' position does the
cause of public debate no good whatsoever.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Profitable lessons for an outdated school system:
Educational reform and plans to create a network of private schools are
gaining momentum in the US
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the dreams of reformers are realised, many 21st century Americans will
not remember their first day at school. The futuristic 'campuses' planned by
Mr Chris Whittle, a Tennessee entrepreneur, will be cradle-to-college
institutions.
Harried parents will be able to deposit their new-born children in day-care
facilities. As the children grow up they will move into kindergarten and
thence through the customary 12 grades of American education. A one-stop
Whittle campus, smothered in the latest technology, will serve their every
need.
Starting school at age zero is just one of a host of innovations proposed by
Mr Whittle. Like other reformers in the US, he believes every assumption
underlying conventional schooling must be challenged.
Why close schools before parents finish work? Why open them only five days a
week? Why let students vegetate during the summer? Why slice the curriculum
into 40 minute slots with artificial subject boundaries? Why expect 25
different students to learn at the same pace from one teacher? Why rely on
textbooks in an age of computers and videos?
To turn ideas into reality, Mr Whittle has launched the Edison Project. With
Dollars 60m in seed money, a team will spend the coming year drawing up a
blueprint for an entirely new form of American education. Mr Whittle hopes
to open 100 new-style campuses by 1996, initially providing only day-care,
kindergarten and elementary education. By 2010, he hopes to have 1,000
campuses spread across America, serving 2m students of all ages and
backgrounds.
He is not a philanthropist. Whittle schools intend to make a profit by
charging parents fees of about Dollars 5,500 a year - roughly the per pupil
cost of public (government-run) education. The profits will supposedly be
made by using less bureaucracy than the public sector and by making better
use of new technologies.
When Mr Whittle unveiled these grandiose plans last year, he lacked
credibility. He is best known for a satellite TV network that beams news
(plus commercials) to classrooms. What, complained sceptics, does Mr Whittle
 -a drop out from Columbia Law School - know about education?
He has responded by hiring some big names. His greatest coup came 10 days
ago when Mr Benno Schmidt, the president of Yale University, announced he
was quitting to become chief executive of the Edison Project. This voluntary
descent from the pinnacle of American education stunned colleagues. It was
as if the Master of Trinity College Cambridge had abruptly declared his
intention to run a chain of City Technology Colleges.
Mr Schmidt will head a team that includes some feisty contributors to
America's educational debate, such as Mr Chester Finn, a former adviser to
Presidents Reagan and Bush, and Mr John Chubb, a fellow at the Brookings
Institution and co-author of Politics, Markets and America's Schools, an
influential book that argued for more competition and choice in US
education.
Mr Whittle's skills as a publicist are not in doubt. But does his plan have
any hope of succeeding? Given the anxiety about standards in public schools,
many affluent parents will experiment with Whittle schools. But whether the
venture can succeed on the scale intended and serve as a model for the
public sector is much less certain.
Mr Whittle reckons he will have to raise about Dollars 2.5bn to cover the
costs of opening 1,000 campuses. This is a huge sum for an educational
project aiming to make a commercial return. The appetite of investors,
moreover, may be reduced by the project's streak of apparent altruism. To
counter charges of cream-skimming, Mr Whittle has pledged to:
Reserve 20 per cent of places for needy students and fund them through
scholarships.
Forgo entry tests and select pupils randomly if there is excess demand for
places.
Hold charges per pupil at or below the level in public schools.
The point of these conditions is to ensure that reforms pioneered in Whittle
schools can be copied by the public sector. The Edison team wants to show
that it can take the same raw material and provide a better education at a
lower cost. But the cross subsidies will obviously reduce its overall return
on capital.
If the team really wants to improve public sector education, why doesn't it
participate in the Bush administration's 'America 2000' initiative? The
White House is awarding contracts for the creation of a new generation of
public schools - at least one for each of the 535 congressional districts.
Mr Schmidt hotly rejects the criticism. His aim in leaving Yale is to
improve all schools, he says. He just happens to believe reform can be
promoted more effectively from outside the public sector. Bureaucracies, he
says, are just not good at 'innovation, risk-taking and paradigm leaps.'
He draws a parallel with higher education. Support for a private college
such as Stanford University, he says, does not constitute an attack on the
University of California, a public-sector institution. In his view, American
higher education flourishes because it is competitive and diverse; the same
ought to be true of secondary education.
Mr Whittle, meanwhile, sees no conflict in his dual role as entrepreneur and
social reformer: 'You can do good and do well at the same time,' he says.
His timing, at least, is good. After a decade of relentless criticism of
public schools, the US seems ready for educational experiments. But the
profitability of the Whittle project may ultimately hinge on a reform that
remains intensely controversial. If US states were to introduce some form of
voucher scheme - distribute their educational budgets directly to parents
rather than to government-run schools - every family would be able to afford
a Whittle school. The mould of American education would then be truly
broken. Indeed, Mr Whittle would soon face an army of competitors.
Opposition to vouchers remains intense, mainly on the grounds that they
would accentuate existing educational inequality. In fact everything would
depend on the rules: if every child got the same voucher and no topping up
was permitted, inequality might be reduced. The Edison team, however, knows
that extending the range of educational choices available will exert
pressure for reforms that make choice easier - and hence that improve its
prospects.
Whatever the outcome of the debate, the momentum for reform seems
unstoppable. The American high school is about a century old. In its day it
was a world-beating social innovation, providing an unrivalled mass
education that helped the US economy cruise past international competitors.
In the face of today's quite different social and economic challenges, the
US is becoming aware that its 19th century blueprint is hopelessly dated.
Hence the pressure to 're-invent' schools.
The Edison Project and similar public-sector ventures are starting with a
blank sheet of paper, or rather a blank computer screen. If they succeed,
America's competitors could find themselves leapfrogged for a second time.

MANAGING PUBLIC SERVICES
By Richard Common, Norman Flynn and Elizabeth Mellon
Butterworth-Heinemann, Pounds 30,
152 pages
The revolution begun in Britain's public services by Mrs Thatcher is
reaching into the heart of Whitehall, with the announcement this week that
up to 25 per cent of civil servants could find themselves competing for
their jobs against the private sector. The public services minister, Mr
William Waldegrave, told a conference in London that the extension of
compulsory competitive tendering from local to central government was the
next step in raising the quality and cost-effectiveness of the civil
service.
Already some parts of the government machine have been privatised. Others
have been hived off in executive agencies with management autonomy from
Whitehall. The parts which remain must now adapt to a new culture of
contracting-out and managerial efficiency - with the Citizen's Charter
constantly demanding higher-quality services and promising compensation if
performance falls below standard.
Yet good government is much more than the efficient delivery of services, as
Dr Oonagh McDonald shows in her thorough account of 13 years of radical
change in the civil service. Public services remain in the public sphere
because they are required to address non-market objectives, such as equality
of treatment and public accountability.
These objectives often conflict with profit-maximising. Offering equal
access to public transport will make it harder to make a profit, for
example. And the regulation of safety standards is too sensitive to be
delegated to bodies which are not subject to democratic accountability.
The government's reforms aim to create quasi-markets in the public services.
Competing organisations from the public, private and voluntary sectors
provide services under contract to purchasing bodies such as health
authorities, local councils and - soon - central government departments.
Yet public services are not entirely free to respond to market signals.
Under-used jobcentres or vehicle testing stations often cannot be closed
because of the need to maintain a nationwide network. Charges may be
determined by statute or be subject to other controls. Competition against
the private sector is forbidden or constrained.
And there is often no identifiable consumer whose satisfaction can be the
determination of success. Who is the customer to be satisfied by the prison
service - the prisoner, the judicial system or the public?
The complexities created for public sector managers by these quasi-markets
are explored by Common, Flynn and Mellon in their fascinating guidebook to
managing such reforms. Drawing on extensive experience of consultancy in the
public sector, they offer a range of strategies for improving efficiency
within publicly accountable services. Their recommendations are expertly
illustrated by case studies of nine public services, from the social
security benefits agency to London buses.
Many of their prescriptions will seem commonplace to those in the private
sector. For example, they advocate research to find out just what the
customer wants. Yet this is a necessary counterweight to a culture in which
the customer has had to make do with what the public service is prepared to
offer.
They also call for new approaches to personnel, management and training.
People working in the public services must cast off the bureaucratic
approach and learn to take individual initiative. More leadership is needed,
rather than just management.
Decision-making should be devolved so that real power is exercised closest
to the customer. Decentralisation is not without its dangers when
administering tax and benefits, for example - equality of treatment can
crumble if frontline staff exercise discretion. Yet managers who are asked
to bear extra responsibility will soon be demotivated if they are given no
real power to affect matters.
The existing constitutional arrangements under which public services are run
do little to help. The doctrine of ministerial responsibility encourages
ministers, MPs and the taxpayer to believe that politicians should be
responsible for every last aspect of the public services. Managers all too
often have the rug pulled from under their feet by their political
paymasters for short-term political expediency.
The politicians should certainly remain accountable for the general policy
behind the public services. But day-to-day responsibility must be passed
down to managers empowered to improve service delivery. New forms of
accountability are needed which recognise these changed circumstances -
including ombudsmen with increased powers to deal directly with
maladministration.
Just as managerial reforms are needed to improve the efficiency of public
services, so too are constitutional reforms if public services can continue
to be held to account.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The EC after the veto
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DANES' rejection of the Maastricht treaty is a substantial setback for
the politicians and bureaucrats in Brussels and Copenhagen, both of whom
fought to win a 'yes' to European union from this small and sceptical
electorate. But all is not lost, certainly not for the European Community,
or even for hopes of economic and monetary union. There could even be gains.
What may now have to be devised, though only after careful and cool
reflection, is an EC that allows still greater diversity of commitments
among its members than envisaged in the Maastricht treaty. Such a Community
would, in any case, best tackle the twin tasks of widening and deepening
that confront it.
The referendum cloud which descended yesterday on Brussels contains silver
linings. From the moment the ink was dry on the Maastricht agreement, it has
been evident that the treaty contained powerful contradictions. By
sharpening the focus of governments and electorates on what was agreed by
the River Maas, some of these contradictions may now be resolved.
Whether a more positive outcome is reached will depend on how the rest of
the EC reacts to the Danish shot fired across their collective gunwales.
Hard though it might be, Mr Jacques Delors, Mr Helmut Kohl and Mr Francois
Mitterrand should try to avoid falling into depression.
There are ways to resolve their immediate problem. It might, for example, be
possible for the other 11 nations to implement important parts of the
Maastricht agreement - for instance, on economic and monetary union, or on
foreign policy co-operation - by swiftly moving to a new legislative basis,
independent of that agreed last year.
The 11 could even carry on the ratification process presently in hand and
hope to steer the Danes on board, perhaps through yet another referendum.
Yet the tone of 'Euro-business as usual' adopted in Bonn and Paris yesterday
is not entirely convincing.
The problem is not merely that the legitimacy of the consent granted by the
Danish people in such circumstances would have to be doubted. The greater
difficulty is that the Danes may be articulating doubts that are more widely
shared. If the leaders of Europe have, in fact, advanced too far ahead of
their peoples, they leave not merely themselves but the achievements of the
EC itself vulnerable to populist, even xenophobic counter-attack.
Better than attempt to continue with business as usual would be to take
stock and consider how best to deal with the challenge now presented.
Wildly irresponsible
In the first place, it would be wildly irresponsible to suggest that the
failure to ratify this treaty, should that eventually happen, must threaten
the achievements of the EC. The EC, as it is, is the basis for the
prosperity and stability of western Europe. A failure to go forward would
not make it necessary, let alone advisable, for anyone to dream of going
backwards.
In the second place, it might be wise to consider ways of allowing member
states to go beyond where they are now at different speeds and even in
different ways. The Schengen group of countries committed to the abolition
of border controls is an example. The Benelux was an earlier one.
It would not be impossible, for example, for a treaty on economic and
monetary union to be agreed among a number of member states, even on the
lines agreed at Maastricht. Any central bank thus set up would ultimately
replace the Bundesbank within the EMS, leaving to outsiders the same
relationship with the core participants as they now have.
Irregular shifts
In the third place, a more fluid structure would have the merit of making
enlargement of the EC easier than seemed possible under the Maastricht
framework, without further administrative change. Progress towards a more
united Europe would then occur through irregular shifts, with the different
countries maintaining freedom to decide which of several concentric European
circles of integration they wish to join.
Last but not least, inflation convergence and exchange rate stabilisation
within the EC (indeed, within western Europe as a whole) predates the debate
about Emu, let alone the outcome of the inter-governmental conference. There
is no reason why it should not continue, even if the prospect of Emu were to
become less immediate.
The reason for convergence was the willingness of EC member states to pursue
the necessary policies. The orthodox doctrine has spread in the course of
the 1980s from its Germanic core to places as far afield as Dublin, London,
Madrid and Lisbon. It is an economic, not a political, doctrine. Governments
must now restate their commitment both to exchange rate stability and to the
fiscal policies laid down in the Maastricht treaty. They should do so, for
the sound reason that it is in their own individual interest to do so.
If the member states make such a commitment credible, then the disruption in
bond and exchange rate markets that some now fear need not happen. In fact,
long-term interest rates - the best single measure of the markets'
expectations for long-term inflation and exchange rates - are no closer
together than are the current rates of inflation. So the markets do not seem
to be persuaded that Emu is inevitable. Provided governments act
appropriately, markets should also not conclude that continued convergence
is impossible. For some countries this poses a major challenge, Italy being
the most important. But it is a challenge that Italy would have had to meet,
in any case.
The essential requirements now are neither to panic nor to ignore what has
happened. It would be wrong to panic, partly because so much has already
been achieved within the EC; still more because the members of the EC
possess other ways of achieving the integration of Europe as a whole.
It would be equally foolish to ignore what has happened. The EC is an
association of democratic states. It will survive only with the consent of
its peoples. The failure to win that consent must lead to consideration of
why that has happened. If policymakers must now rethink at least some of
what they agreed, so be it. In the long run, only thus will they be able to
build a durable, contented and integrated Community.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Arts: Feinberg &amp; Richter - Piano recitals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Under its new regime the Institute of Contemporary Arts has restored
contemporary music to its programming. The ICA has already this year
sheltered a number of short concert series. On Sunday evenings throughout
the spring it has been presenting New MusICA, a series of piano recitals
devised by Adrian Jack, whose original MusICA programmes were one of the
most valuable and distinctive strands in London's new music in the early
1980s. The reborn series promises to concentrate on those same areas of the
repertory that tend to fall outside the regard of the new-music mainstream,
and often features performers whose work remains undervalued in this
country.
Last Sunday's recital was given by Alan Feinberg, who made his British debut
in MusICA in 1985; he has gone to establish himself as one of America's
leading proponents of present-day music. In what was easily the most
conventional programme of the series Feinberg included two works written for
him - Shulamit Ram's 1982 Verticals, and Charles Wuorinen's Third Piano
Sonata from 1986. Both belong to the brash, noisy school of American piano
writing.
For all its technical adroitness Ram's piece was a disappointment,
especially from a composer whose works are getting increasing acclaim
(including a Pulitzer Prize) in the US; it is heavy on rhetoric and short of
distinctive ideas. Wuorinen's sonata too buries most of its substance under
a welter of notes. Yet Feinberg plays such music dazzlingly, with fine
control and pinpoint articulation; he makes a very persistent advocate. It
was surprising, though, that the Ravel and Faure pieces with which he'd
begun were made so unprepossessing, monochrome and unidiomatic in music that
demands much more care, style and fine judgment.
In Birmingham's Symphony Hall on Tuesday Sviatoslav Richter gave the
programme he had cancelled in London nine days earlier: a sequence of Brahms
piano pieces was prefaced by some of the most arcane and rarely performed of
Bach's early keyboard works. The recital only intermittently reached the
heights of Richter's appearance in the Festival Hall last week; at its
finest it was magnificent, but in other places textures were smudged and
passage work garbled, to the extent that the poise and shape of the music
was sometimes under threat.
The Bach toccatas that made up the bulk of the first half are problematic
pieces; one of them in D, masquerading as a 'Sonata', is very inferior,
four-square stuff indeed. But Richter treated them all with deep
seriousness, explosively attacking their bravura elements, colouring the
slow sections with grace and charm, if never quite managing to disguise
their rougher corners. The approach was far more robust and straightforward
than his famous treatment of the Preludes and Fugues; that kind of minutely
detailed, rapt intensity might in any case have seemed out of place in a
space as large as Symphony Hall.
The proportions of the Brahms performances were never in doubt. The pieces
emerged almost in a single sweep, with only the C major Capriccio from Op.
78 appearing slightly misjudged. The first two Ballades of Op. 10 had
vividly dramatic central episodes, the D minor in particular generating a
terrifying climax out of virtually nothing; the G minor Rhapsody Op 79 no. 1
was tautly controlled, every element slotted into its place in the scheme.
The final collection of pieces from Op 118 and Op 119 appeared to have been
planned as a self-contained grouping in itself, alternating extroversion
with intensely wrought tragedy. The E flat minor Intermezzo was its
highpoint, wandering through its dark harmonic world with the merest
glimmerings of light and shade, and a central theme made to heave itself up
by its bootstraps.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Arts: A Midsummer Night's Dream - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There are some greater pleasures in an English summer than watching A
Midsummer Night's Dream in the Open Air Theatre in Regent's Park, but not
many. Even in a summer that promises to be as good as this, it still takes a
while to get used to. Strange things fall from the air, the aeroplanes can
distract, but within minutes the spell begins to work and, as darkness
falls, it is entrancing.
This time last year, it was almost freezing. Blankets and gloves were the
order of the day, but it was still worth it. Now the weather is kinder and
Ian Talbot's production seems a little gentler than last year's as well. The
main change is that Dinsdale Landen has taken over from Roy Hudd as Bottom.
I will not say that he is better, but he is certainly different.
Landen is physically a small figure, smaller than the other workmen who
perform the play of Pyramus and Thisbe. He seems to get by more by charm
than pushing. He is not really bully Bottom, just more enthusiastic than the
rest and with relatively delicate manners. When he is given the ass's head,
his voice changes and becomes distinctly nasal. He seems embarrassed when
Titania falls for him, but gradually grows more pompous as in the line 'I
have a reasonable good ear in music.'
The head itself is a delight. The eyes, the eyebrows, the nostrils, the ears
all move. And when it comes off, Landen is left to reflect poetically on
Bottom's dream. Perhaps because the interpretation is so modest, this is one
of the best Bottoms I have seen. And it is not all Bottom's play. All the
workmen excel: see, in particular, George Pensotti as Robin Starveling, the
tailor. When it comes to their performance in the Athenian court, some of
the audience are laughing so much at the gestures that it is almost
impossible to hear the lines.
The lovers star, too. Sarah-Jane Holm was an excellent Hermia last year and
repeats the performance. This time there is a wonderful Helena in Anna
Patrick who uses her height to the full. When Helena and Hermia quarrel, it
is almost a physical combat. The male lovers are not at all bad, but are
quite outshone by the women. Hermia is booted off into the outlying bushes
as Talbot's production makes use of the Regent's Park space: then she comes
crawling back.
If there is a reservation, it is the same as last year: the fairies are a
trifle tatty. Gavin Muir's Puck is unnecessarily punk: neither Oberon nor
Titania are especially attractive. The lesser fairies look almost too
literally like mustardseed and cobweb. I cannot see why they should not be
more conventionally pretty.
Still, that is a small matter. The whole performance is a joy, even down to
the normally almost unnoticeable part of Philostrate, the master of the
revels, played here with great style by Paul Aves.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sterling Publishing, the USM-listed company best known as publishers of
Debrett's Peerage, has taken on Clare Whitley for the newly created position
of finance director.
Whitley had previously been finance director of Saatchi &amp; Saatchi
Advertising International. Sterling managing director Michael Summers says
he found her because she had decided to take a sabbatical when the job at
Saatchi's 'no longer proved a challenge.'
Her early training had been at Price Waterhouse, and then Unigate, latterly
as group treasurer.
But her more recent experience at Saatchis prepares her well specifically
for Sterling, which, as a trade and technical magazine and book publisher,
works almost entirely in the advertising-financed sector.
Summers remains cagey as to exactly why he needs a finance director at this
point.
A chartered accountant himself, as is his deputy chairman Michael Preston,
he says that whereas there had always been enough financial expertise on the
board until now, 'we are strengthening the management team ready for a
period of growth and expansion.'
While Sterling dipped well into loss last financial year (ending March 31
1991) Summers contends that this year's results, due mid July, will
demonstrate it is again 'running in the right direction.'
Putting a full time finance director on the board is ' a positive step, not
a defensive one' he makes out.
Of Whitley, he continues:' We think we've found a real nugget. She arrived
on Monday and already has her feet well under the table. She is out now
travelling around our subsidiaries acquainting herself with the financial
controllers.'

FT  04 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Advance payment bond binds insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MERCERS COMPANY v NEW HAMPSHIRE INSURANCE CO Court of Appeal (Lord
Justice Parker, Lord Justice Nolan and Lord Justice Scott): May 12 1992 A
NON-REPUDIATORY and unsubstantial breach of a building contract by the
employers does not wholly or partly discharge a surety from his joint and
several liability under an advance payment bond to repay to the employers
unearned advance payments made by them to the contractor.
The Court of Appeal so held when allowing an appeal by the plaintiffs, the
Wardens and Commonalty of the Mystery of Mercers of the City of London, from
Mr Justice Phillips's decision that the defendant, the New Hampshire
Insurance Company, was not liable for monies allegedly due to the Mercers
under a bond.
LORD JUSTICE PARKER said Mercers claimed against New Hampshire for monies
allegedly due under an advance payment bond.
The bond related to an advance payment of Pounds 4.5m made by Mercers to
Rush &amp; Tompkins Ltd in respect of a building contract for works to be
carried out by Rush &amp; Tompkins for Pounds 5m.
The contract provided for Mercers to give possession of the site in mid-May
1989, but the date could be deferred until about the end of June.
Possession was not given until July 24.
From July 24 Rush &amp; Tompkins proceeded with the works. On April 26 1990 it
went into receivership and the contract was automatically terminated.
At that time only Pounds 1m of the advance payment had been applied. On June
29 Mr Justice Hobhouse granted an application by Mercers for interim payment
by New Hampshire. The payment was made and the action proceeded to trial.
On January 13 1991 Mr Justice Phillips held that New Hampshire was under no
liability under the bond. He dismissed the claim and ordered repayment of
the interim payment. On March 21 he held that interest should be paid for
the period in which Mercers had use of the money.
New Hampshire appealed against Mr Justice Hobhouse's order for interim
payment. Mercers appealed against Mr Justice Phillips's judgments on
liability and interest.
New Hampshire's contention that it was under no liability rested solely on
the fact that Mercers failed to give possession of the site in mid-May or
within six weeks.
The first issue was as to the nature of the bond - whether it was a
guarantee, and if so, of what. That depended on its construction.
Under the bond Rush &amp; Tompkins as 'principal', and New Hampshire as
'surety', were bound 'jointly and severally' to Mercers for Pounds 4.5m.
The bond recited that it was given 'to save' Mercers 'against any and all
losses' which might result from Rush &amp; Tompkins's failure 'to faithfully
employ for the purpose of the contract and liquidate . . . all or any
portion of the advance payments'.
New Hampshire contended that the bond on its true construction constituted a
guarantee of performance of the contract, and that the terms of the contract
were embodied in the bond by reference.
Mercers contended that the bond was simply a promise to pay a specific sum
on a contingency which had happened.
The description of Rush &amp; Tompkins as principal and New Hampshire as surety
was consistent with a guarantee, but was followed by a joint and several
promise to pay.
That was not consistent with an ordinary guarantee, where the creditor would
have a cause of action against the principal debtor for the debt, and a
separate cause of action against the guarantor under the contract of
guarantee.
Nothing in the document could be construed as a performance guarantee.
Its plain purpose was to ensure that if Rush &amp; Tompkins did not earn the
amount of the advance payment, both Rush &amp; Tompkins and New Hampshire should
be jointly and severally liable to Mercers for the balance.
New Hampshire's suretyship consisted in no more than making itself jointly
and severally liable for unearned balance.
The contention that the bond was a performance guarantee was rejected.
Nor was it a guarantee of Rush &amp; Tompkins's liability to repay unearned
balance. Mercers simply wanted the protection given by New Hampshire's
joining in the liability.
The second issue was whether Mercers' breach of the building contract
discharged New Hampshire from liability under the bond.
National Westminster Bank v Riley (1986) BCLC 268 established that a breach
of contract not amounting to a repudiation would not discharge a guarantor
unless it amounted to a 'not unsubstantial' departure from a term of the
principal contract embodied in the guarantee, either expressly or by
implication.
Here, the breach was not repudiatory and the terms as to date for possession
were not expressly nor impliedly embodied in the bond.
Furthermore, in the context of a two-year building contract, a four-week
delay in giving possession could not be regarded as a 'not unsubstantial'
breach.
New Hampshire was not discharged by the breach.
The next question was whether there was partial discharge.
There was considerable force in the contention that New Hampshire's prima
facie liability to pay unearned balance should be reduced by the extra
amount which Rush &amp; Tompkins would have earned had possession of the site
been given according to contract.
However, that could not be accepted. The obligation under the bond was a
simple one, to pay unearned balance. Accordingly, New Hampshire was not
discharged in whole or in part.
The appeal on liability was allowed. Mr Justice Phillips's order was set
aside. Judgment was given for Mercers for Pounds 3.4m.
Mercers' appeal as to interest was no longer a reality. New Hampshire's
appeal against Mr Justice Hobhouse's judgment was dismissed.
LORD JUSTICE NOLAN said Riley was concerned with a bank guarantee, but the
principle applied equally to the bond.
The breach of contract was not repudiatory. Just as the four week delay was
insufficient to discharge the building contract, so it was insufficient to
discharge the bond.
The effect of delay on Rush &amp; Tompkins's ability to satisfy the condition of
the bond was, however, substantial. The judge said the evidence suggested
that, had the work commenced when it should have done, approximately Pounds
500,000 worth of additional work would have been carried out before the
group failed.
That was not accepted by Mercers, which put forward calculations leading to
figures in the region of Pounds 100,000. Even that was a substantial sum.
New Hampshire was not asked to consent to possession being granted four
weeks late. There was no justification for saddling it with responsibility
for a loss which arose outside the contract and which was due to Mercers'
failure.
For those reasons, his Lordship would have allowed the main appeal in part
only , and would have remitted the matter to the judge for determination of
the amount by which Mercers' loss was due to its delay in giving possession
of the site.
In all other respects he agreed with Lord Justice Parker.
LORD JUSTICE SCOTT agreeing that the appeal should be allowed, said there
was a sense in which the bond was a guarantee. It imposed on Rush &amp; Tompkins
and New Hampshire a joint and several liability to repay Mercers
unliquidated advance payment. It would not however be accurate to describe
the bond as a guarantee of Rush &amp; Tompkins's obligations under the building
contract.
The bond resisted tidy categorisation. New Hampshire's participation was in
substance as guarantor, the obligation guaranteed being the obligation of
Rush &amp; Tompkins to pay the unliquidated part of the advance payment.
Postponement for four weeks of the date on which possession was given did
not affect New Hampshire's liability.
For Mercers: Michael Beloff QC and Susan Prevezer (Masons).
For New Hampshire: Rupert Jackson QC and Richard Wilmot-Smith (Davis Blank
Furniss, Manchester).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Jonathan Charkham, an adviser to the Governor of the Bank of England, is
underscoring his reputation as one of the world's leading experts on
corporate governance by being appointed the first foreigner on a US
presidential committee examining the subject.
Charkham, 61, is one of 24 members of the newly-established subcouncil on
Corporate Governance and Financial Markets chaired by Edward Regan,
comptroller of the state of New York. It is one of eight subcouncils of the
President's Competitiveness Policy Council which advises the President and
Congress on issues affecting the competitiveness of US industry.
The Corporate Governance subcouncil will 'study if, and to what extent our
current system of corporate governance and the nature of financial markets
constrain US corporations' ability to fully realise their strategic plans
and to compete in world markets'.
Carolyn Brancato, executive director of Columbia Law School's Institutional
Investor project, has been appointed staff director of the new subcouncil
which will meet three times. Its recommendations will be included in the
second annual report of the Competitiveness Council.
Charkham, who has just finished a paper on corporate governance in the US,
is already a member of Columbia's Institutional Investor project advisory
board and has come to know many of the figures involved in the US debate.
Other members of the subcouncil include the New York Stock Exchange's
William Donaldson, Martin Lipton, a lawyer who made his name in some of the
fiercest takeover battles in recent history, John Neff of Wellington
Management and Richard Breeden of the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The new council has a much wider remit than Sir Adrian Cadbury's committee
on corporate governance in the UK. In addition to the traditional questions
about the relationships between directors and managers it will also study
'to what extent rapid turnover in securities markets, use of new investment
instruments such as derivatives, and heightened attention to quarterly
financial statements cause corporate management to function with less than
optimal time horizons'.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Technology: Blank cheque for the thinking chip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUISE KEHOE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Synaptics, a Silicon Valley pioneer in the field of neural network chips,
has developed the first commercial application of its futuristic technology;
an electronic 'retina' that can read the numbers printed on the bottom of
cheques in order to verify that customers have enough money in their account
to cover the transaction.
Neural networks - computers that mimic the functions of the human brain -
have long been the subject of learned papers and scientific experiments.
Bringing neural technology out of the laboratory and into the commercial
world has proved almost as big a challenge as creating a 'thinking machine'.
Synaptics was founded in 1986 by two authorities on chip design; Carver
Mead, a professor at the California Institute of Technology, and Federico
Faggin, who designed the first microprocessor.
In collaboration with VeriFone, a leading supplier of transaction automation
systems used to verify credit and debit cards, Synaptics has designed a chip
for an automatic cheque reader which speeds up transactions by improving
accuracy.
The device can instantly recognise the Magnetic Ink Character Recognition
(MICR) symbols printed at the bottom of cheques. In theory, this long line
of digits is supposed to adhere to standards that make it readable by less
sophisticated magnetic systems. In reality, however, cheque printers do not
always live up to precise specifications.
Ink density and printing pressure create wide variations, and the alignment
of the paper may also be imperfect. People can still read them, but machines
cannot.
Typical cheque reader systems, used by financial institutions, cost as much
as 100 times more and score about 80 per cent accuracy. They require a
cheque to be passed carefully through the system at a pre-determined speed
and angle by a motorised system. In contrast, the neural system can be used
at the point of sale, enabling customers or sales clerks to swipe a cheque
through the reader and still achieve accuracy of 99.6 per cent, according to
tests conducted by independent researchers SRI International.
According to Faggin, Synaptics chief executive, the cheque reader is just
the beginning. 'The neural chip represents a tiny fraction of what we'll
eventually be able to do with neural networks. As neural technology evolves
and becomes more generally available, the applications expand until the
imagination becomes the only limit.'
The same electronic vision tech-nology used in the cheque reader might also
be used to recognise handwriting or thumbprints, or to detect counterfeit
money. With these types of 'perceptive' chips, any type of pattern
recognition, whether it be identifying documents or graphical images, can be
implemented faster and more accurately than with conventional computers.
Speech recognition, in which neural network chips mimic human hearing
functions, and robotics, where the chips control sensory motor functions,
are likely applications in the long term. In the shorter term, VeriFone
hopes to use the neural chip as the basis of a cash recognition system which
can read bank notes. This will reduce mistakes at the point of sale and help
to eliminate pilfering by keeping track of the amount of money that has
changed hands.
While pushing forward the frontiers of computer science, Synaptic's founders
do not expect to displace conventional digital devices. Instead, they see
'intuitive' computers being coupled with the high-speed processing power of
'logical' computers to capture the best of both worlds.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Technology: Clear about liquid crystal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The LCD project started in 1984, with the long-term goal of producing flat
screens for high-definition televisions to be manufactured by Ferguson. It
received a boost with funding from the UK government's Alvey and Joers
research programmes from 1986.
When Thorn sold Ferguson to Thomson of France in 1987, 'its home within the
company disappeared but a clear decision was taken that this was a very
valuable development and CRL would continue to invest to take it to the
point of licensing,' says Ashok Vaidya, CRL commercial manager.
Thorn has concentrated on a type of display called digital ferroelectric
liquid crystal (FLCD) which has largely been ignored by the Japanese
electronics industry with the exception of Canon. It has many theoretical
advantages over the thin film transistor (TFT) technology favoured by the
majority - simpler, cheaper and faster to respond to electrical impulses -
but it has been difficult to develop as a practical screen because it is
sensitive to shocks.
The FLCD demonstrator built by CRL is based on the VGA graphics standard for
up-market portable computers. It shows good colour picture quality and a
wide angle of view. Above all, it is rugged and durable - a drawback of
other FLCD systems has been their tendency to fail if knocked.
CRL has just signed its first FLCD licensing agreement with a large Japanese
electronics manufacturer and 'is working to secure further licensees'.
As Vaidya concedes, it has been difficult to persuade companies to take up
FLCD when most of the industry is so committed to developing TFT technology.
Another problem is that Thorn has no FLCD production line to show potential
licensees who have doubts about its suitability as a technology for
mass-production.
Even so, CRL is continuing to develop FLCD because Thorn researchers are
convinced that it has the best long-term potential of all display systems.
'We're concentrating on taking the technology leaps, rather than grinding
through the production engineering work, which is best done by
manufacturers,' Vaidya says.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Management: Clash of steel as beer can battle is joined -
Gary Mead looks at moves to woo designers away from aluminium
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
British Steel's tin plate division has just paid Pounds 16,000 for 150 empty
cans of non-existent, fictitious beer. Everyone knows that premium lagers
are absurdly expensive, but surely Pounds 106 a can is just a little
extravagant?
British Steel shareholders can relax; their money is not being wasted but
invested in a project which could well turn out to be a clever marketing
investment in steel's battle with aluminium manufacturers over who supplies
the metal for the 7bn beer and beverage cans sold annually in the UK.
This week, British Steel's tin plate division is taking a stall at the
international packaging exhibition - Pakex '92 - at the National Exhibition
Centre in Birmingham. The hope is that the collection of fake beer cans -
with invented names like 'Old Guinea Stout' - will persuade packagers that a
combination of technical innovation and design work means that steel meets
their requirements.
Though empty, the cans were neither cheap nor easy to produce. Lewis
Moberly, the London designers, took on the commission a year ago. The brief
was to come up with designs which would display a new tin plate steel to the
best visual effect. British Steel is now pushing ahead a marketing drive
which uses Moberly's beer-can designs as examples of what can be done with
the new type of tin plate.
While most food cans around the world are made of steel, there is an
international battle between steel and aluminium for the important beer and
beverage sector. In the UK this market is divided almost equally between
steel and aluminium. In Germany and Holland, steel has about 90 per cent of
the market but if you buy a canned drink in the US, it is almost certainly
going to be in aluminium.
British Steel now regards itself as competing in an international market and
its drive to gain market share is both technical and marketing driven.
On the technical side, British Steel's research and development arm has
reduced the weight of the average steel can by 53 per cent since 1968. David
Jones, research and development manager at the tin plate division, says: 'We
think that aluminium has now reached its weight reduction limit, whereas we
believe we can reduce the weight of a 33cl steel can by another 33 per cent
in a fairly short time, which means that steel will become very
competitive.'
Removing one of the main competitive advantages of aluminium - low weight -
without sacrificing the greatest asset of steel - its strength - will give
vital marketing advantages.
But as the two metals close the weight gap, the competition focuses on less
tangible areas, such as appearance and design qualities.
Jones says: 'We are not just marketing tin plate but marketing tin plate as
a finished product.'
Julie Bell, in charge of the tin plate division's marketing development,
picked up from brewers that their marketing managers had hit on a more
metallic look as a means of attracting supermarket shoppers to high premium
beers. 'The premium perception is actually for a metallic look. It was using
the look of the metal itself in the design. If you look along the shelves,
the majority of the premium beers show a lot more metal on the can.'
Given that aluminium has a naturally brighter appearance than tin plate,
British Steel risked losing out on the high premium beer canning market.
Consequently, it has been working to develop a new and brighter look to its
tin plate steel. It now manufactures what it calls a 'bright' tin plated
steel, with as great a shininess as aluminium.
The bright tin plate gave Moberly's designers something new to work on, to
demonstrate to both brewers and other designers that there is an alternative
to aluminium even if they want to go for a sparkling metallic look.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Accountancy Column: Auditors applaud as boat remains
unrocked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG gale blew across Britain last week, when hundreds of accountants
sighed with relief as they read the favourable findings of the Cadbury
report on the financial aspects of corporate governance. Their opponents
might have mistaken it for a blast of hot air.
As something created, housed, funded, widely lobbied and partly staffed by
accountants, the Cadbury committee was likely to take a sympathetic view of
the profession.
Accountants, their firms and representative bodies often publicly lauded the
work of the committee chaired by Sir Adrian Cadbury since its creation in
May 1991. Some even seemed to regard it as a panacea for the recent
high-profile criticisms of auditors.
But many other accountants - as well as the relatively small number outside
the profession aware of the committee's existence - privately conceded the
report was likely to be a damp squib. They were not disappointed.
Some interesting and worthwhile proposals are contained in the 70-page
report - even some radical ideas, in earlier drafts and suggestions. But
most of the strong words have been diluted in the final version, while those
that remain have been drowned in a round of congratulatory back-slapping.
'The accountancy profession has done much recently to improve its standards
and procedures,' the Cadbury committee says. It supports the work by the
professional bodies on ethical rules and disciplinary arrangements. It
endorses the work of the Financial Reporting Council, the Accounting
Standards Board, the Financial Reporting Review Panel and the Auditing
Practices Board. It welcomes the utterings of the Institutional Shareholders
Committee.
As a result, it comes as no surprise that the report has been widely
welcomed by these very bodies as well as the accountancy firms and some of
their blue-chip clients which are already preaching if not practising many
of the enlightened ideas on corporate governance put forward.
But some would suggest there is a danger that the committee has been a
little too eager to endorse changes already being put in place. One analogy
might be the work of the National Audit Office.
NAO reports provide often excellent, searching scrutinies of government
departments. But by the time (generally many months) the senior civil
servants responsible are summoned to the Commons' Public Accounts Committee
to respond to NAO criticisms, the report has already been widely circulated
and remedial action taken.
At best, that saves bureaucratic face. At worst, it may imply the managers
have helped the consultants identify issues they have already identified and
feel comfortable rectifying. The result is not always an objective way to
look for failures.
In the same way, the heady praise in the Cadbury report needs to be read
with a little scepticism. A number of its recommendations sound impressive,
but add little that is new. For example, it calls for directors to state
whether their company is a going concern, and auditors to report and give
guidance on this judgement. Yet the Auditing Practices Board made just this
proposal last month.
The Cadbury committee suggests non-audit fees received by accountancy firms
from audit clients should be disclosed. This was made mandatory in an
amendment to the Companies' Act for financial year ends beginning after
October 1 last year.
It also calls for guidelines on rotating audit partners, to ensure a fresh
approach. New ethical guidelines published by the Institute of Chartered
Accountants in England and Wales in February state that safeguards against
'loss of independence' should include rotation of the engagement partner on
audits.
Just because these ideas have been launched elsewhere does not make them
wrong. The new bodies created and codes put in place appear promising. But
it is too early to judge them and some would argue it is disappointing to
see recommendations mirroring so closely the action already being taken by
the accountancy profession.
Equally disappointing is the failure of the Cadbury committee to add much to
the debate over two of the more contentious issues facing accountants.
First, the Caparo judgement in the House of Lords, which says that auditors
have a 'duty of care' to the company and its shareholders collectively, but
not to shareholders as individuals or to third parties.
Second, the potential conflicts facing an auditor conducting non-audit work
such as consulting for its client, thus receiving large fees which may
threaten independence and being in the position of auditing the work of
other parts of its own firm. Other than suggesting disclosure of non-audit
remuneration - which does nothing to identify conflicts which may arise -
the report rejects calls for change on either of these two issues.
There are, however, positive aspects to the report. Its suggestion of an
auditors' review of interim statements - which should include balance sheet
and even cash flow information - may help reduce the scope for manipulating
figures in the period between audited annual accounts. Legislation to
protect auditors in non-regulated industries if they alert the authorities
of fraud would also be welcome.
Outside the remit of the accountancy profession, there are also some
excellent recommendations. Ensuring that directors' contracts are
re-approved by shareholders every three years, increasing the powers of
high-quality, independent non-executive directors, developing strong
internal control systems, and creating effective audit committees are among
the more praiseworthy objectives.
But all these findings ultimately boil down to enforcement. As the report
itself notes, 'The machinery (for raising expectations of corporate
behaviour) is in place. What is needed is the will to improve its
effectiveness.'
Yet that pressure relies on an entirely voluntary system of compliance. The
backbone of the report is a code of practice. Companies must cite whether
they have complied with the code in their annual reports, on threat of
de-listing by the Stock Exchange if they do not. It is then up to
shareholders to exert pressure if they are not complying.
Whether shareholders and other users of accounts will exert such pressure is
questionable, certainly if their apathy in responding to the draft proposals
so far issued by the Accounting Standards Board is anything to go by. The
quality of corporate governance is likely to be less important to them
(particularly after the end of the recession) than a good return on their
investment.
Equally, whether the Stock Exchange will embrace the concept of the
de-listing threat - at a time when it is concerned to ensure London is an
attractive financial centre - remains to be seen.
The wider recommendations in the Cadbury report ultimately come back to the
auditors. As well as their involvement on particular points - such as
'reviewing' interim statements - they are called on to review the company's
overall compliance with the code of practice.
The firms may balk at the idea of taking on this additional responsibility,
which could make them a good deal more vulnerable to criticism.
Alternatively, they may be able to hide behind the ambiguities that a
'review' rather than a full, legally-defined audit permits. Their agreement
to play along with the spirit of Cadbury may be the last chance for a
voluntary code to work.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Labour wavers on Maastricht
referendum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE prospect of inflicting a damaging Commons defeat on the government is
raising the pressure on Labour's leadership to reconsider its opposition to
a British referendum on the terms of the Maastricht treaty.
After Mr John Major, the prime minister, had again ruled out a poll, Labour
business managers conceded that there was now 'a head of steam' growing
among MPs for a shift in strategy.
With the Liberal Democrats, Conservative rebels and some other minority
parties firmly backing a plebiscite, Labour would have a real possibility of
a morale-boosting victory should it seize the opportunity in the wake of
France's decision to hold a poll.
The problem for Mr Neil Kinnock, who discussed the matter with shadow
cabinet colleagues last night, is that such a move would conflict with the
view he clearly expressed before the the election that complex European
Community questions should be left to the Commons.
Nonetheless, there were clear signs within the parliamentary Labour party
yesterday that the Danish referendum and President Francois Mitterrand's
pledge have altered opinions.
A motion tabled by Mr Tony Benn, urging support for an amendment to the
Maastricht bill demanding a referendum, appeared to be winning tacit support
well beyond Labour's rump group of Euro-sceptic MPs, including that of some
frontbenchers who support closer European union.
After the weekly meeting of the parliamentary party, addressed by both Mr
Bryan Gould and Mr John Smith, the two candidates for the leadership both
expressed scepticism on the value of a plebiscite.
However, with Mr Benn's motion likely to be put to the PLP next week,
neither would definitively rule out the option. Later Mr Gould - whose
campaign manager, Mr David Blunkett, publicly backs a referendum - appeared
to be warming to the idea when he conceded that it did offer 'a means of
testing public opinion'.
Much will depend on how Brussels reacts to the Danish vote over the next few
days. Senior party officials indicated last night that a final decision
would probably come next week.
Earlier Mr Kinnock insisted at the PLP meeting that the treaty was now
'defunct or in hibernation'.
However, Mr Benn pointed out that Labour had at first been sceptical about
his proposal in 1970 to hold a referendum on UK membership of the European
Community, but changed its stance later when France decided to hold a
national plebiscite on its application.
It was absurd that Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, had hinted that
Denmark might hold a second referendum when the UK was not being allowed
one, he said.
Mr John Smith, in his address to the parliamentary party, pledged yesterday
that as leader he would to give a stronger voice to Labour's new intake of
MPs by offering some places on a revived 'review committee' to examine the
working methods of the parliamentary party.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Commons to hold debate on Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LABOUR is to call a full-scale Commons debate on the Maxwell pensioners next
week, in the first opportunity it has had in this parliament to choose the
specific subject for discussion by MPs.
The move, which will be announced today comes after ministers again faced
pressure yesterday from both Tory and opposition MPs to provide an
opportunity for the plight of the pensioners to be raised at Westminster.
Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, will open the debate
on Tuesday, which is expected to concentrate on the need for compensation
for the Maxwell pensioners. Depending on how the motion for debate is
drafted, even Tory MPs campaigning on behalf of the pensioners might find it
difficult to vote against it.
Last night's meeting of the all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of
the Maxwell pensioners re-emphasised the urgency of the plight of the
pensioners.
The group's officers are to appeal to its 100-plus members to press
ministers at questions in the Commons today about when the government
expects to publish the report by the Securities and Investments Board into
the oversight by the Investment Managers' Regulatory Organisation (Imro) of
Bishopsgate Investment Management, the fund management company owned by
Robert Maxwell which managed the assets of his company pension funds.
The report is regarded as being critical to the pensioners' efforts to
establish that government oversight of BIM was lax, and thus strengthen
their claim for government compensation.
Imro is the self-regulatory body for the fund-management industry.
The SIB is said to be concerned that parts of the report may be deemed
libellous and is said to have been told by its solicitors that its charter
may not exempt it from libel actions.
MPs agreed that to try to avoid this problem, they would press the
government to publish the report as a House of Commons paper, so that the
specific approval of the Commons would then be needed before it could be
used in any legal action.
The group yesterday wrote to to Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of
the Bank of England, requesting a meeting, and will be writing to the main
banks in support of the appeals that have already come from the Maxwell
pensioners themselves.
Mr Frank Field and Mr Richard Page, the group's co-chairmen, said that the
real focus of the discussion was the urgency of the pensioners' plight, and
the inadequacy of the state-support system to cover pensioners' immediate
needs.
The group is to step up its pressure on the government to set up a
'drip-feed' if necessary to prevent any more pension funds becoming unable
to pay pensions from the end of this month.
The House of Lords is to debate the position of the Maxwell pensioners
today, but the junior minister replying is unlikely to be able to pre-empt
the announcement from Mr Peter Lilley, the social security secretary, about
a review of pension law and regulation.
The announcement of the review, broadly as recommended by the cross-party
social security committee in the last parliament, is expected next week, and
may coincide with the mass lobby of Westminster by Maxwell pensioners
planned for Monday.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Japanese investment in north set to fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PEAK years of Japanese investment into the north of England are over,
according to a report by the Northern Development Company, the region's
economic regeneration body.
The north, comprising north-east England and Cumbria, has more Japanese
manufacturing investment, in terms of jobs created and money invested, than
any other region in Europe.
But, the report warns, the region cannot expect jobs gains from Japanese
investment in the 1990s to match 1980s levels and must acknowledge that the
UK's traditional advantages of language and lower costs are not on their own
sufficient to counter intense competition, especially from Germany.
The report attributes the likely downturn in Japanese investment to:
The weakening of the yen.
The fact that most big Japanese manufacturers have made their move into
Europe in anticipation of the single market.
Stronger competition for inward investment.
Increasingly, the report warns, as projects become more capital intensive,
investors want not cheap labour but highly-skilled labour - a requirement
Germany may be better able to satisfy.
Germany, it adds, also offers a strategic base for exploiting opportunities
in eastern Europe.
The north now has 48 Japanese companies, of which 27 are manufacturers with
existing or committed investment of more than Pounds 1.5bn.
The report say that to maintain inward investment the north must satisfy the
probably more exacting skills requirements of Japanese manufacturers yet to
invest; target sectors such as pharmaceuticals in which companies are
awaiting completion of single market legislation before moving into Europe;
and target other sources of inward investment, such as the emerging
economies of east Asia.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Newcastle's monument to shopping
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GEORDIE shopping phenomenon entered a new phase yesterday with the
opening of a 50-unit retail mall in the centre of Newcastle upon Tyne.
The Monument Mall, adjoining Eldon Square - which claims to be Europe's
largest city-centre shopping complex - will strengthen Newcastle's hand in
competing against the MetroCentre, Europe's largest out-of-town shopping and
leisure centre, just across the River Tyne in Gateshead.
The Monument Mall is the only retail scheme to be opened in Britain this
year by St Martins Property Corporation, which has reined back development
because of the recession. Construction of Monument Mall cost Pounds 23m; the
scheme's total value including its site and shop outfitting will be about
Pounds 70m.
Although only part of the second floor was ready to start trading for
yesterday's low-key opening, 15,500 shoppers visited the mall in the first
four hours.
Quite why Tyneside, the centre of an area with Britain's highest regional
unemployment rate, should be such a mecca for shopping is constantly
debated. One big factor is relatively low mortgages compared with the
south-east giving good levels of disposable income for those in work.

COMPANIES SHOULD provide information on the environmental impact and risks
they face in their annual reports, the 100 Group of leading finance
directors recommended yesterday.
The group's environmental working party concluded that companies should
normally devote at least one page in the narrative section of their report
to the issues.
It did not specify in detail the information that should be provided, but
the group's statement of good practice says companies should invest time in
identifying environmental priorities and reporting on them accordingly.
They should report on responsibilities, monitoring procedures and
achievement of targets and start to develop verifiable information which can
be independently audited. The chief executive's report should reflect
commitment to the issues, it added.
Mr Bob Carlton-Porter, working party chairman, said: 'There are good reasons
for companies to disclose environmental information voluntarily.'
The paper cites Imperial Chemical Industries and British Steel as two
examples of current best practice.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Pay packages fall for staff transferred to Continent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH COMPANIES are significantly cutting the pay packages they offer to
staff transferred to jobs in continental Europe, according to a survey by
the Confederation of British Industry.
This means that expatriates will no longer be able to bank all or most of
their salaries while living on generous allowances or incentive payments.
Most will be offered transfers abroad on terms matching those for locally
recruited staff, possibly with temporary allowances to cover local housing
costs and children's education.
The research, by the CBI and Mercer Fraser, the consultancy, is based on a
survey of nearly 200 companies. Half had a turnover of Pounds 200m or more,
and half employed more than 2,000 people worldwide.
Foreign-service premiums, included in the traditional packages as an
incentive for working abroad, were considered no longer applicable to the
Continent.
Most organisations provided some sort of assistance with the housing needs
of people transferred abroad, but many were considering ending this system
because of its cost and to bring the housing more into line with that of
locals.
Companies, however, regarded assistance for the education of employees'
children as sacrosanct.
Miss Sue Shortland, head of the CBI's relocation group, said: 'A common
salary structure will make transfers easier. However, there are serious
barriers in the way - like tax, pension and social security systems.'

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BUENOS AIRES
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Menem of Argentina has resorted to emotional blackmail so
as to shame legislators into passing a government bill stuck in Congress for
over six months.
In a surprise national television address late on Tuesday, Mr Menem promised
to award a long-delayed increase in benefits for 3m old-age pensioners if
the Senate were to pass a bill allowing the government to privatise
Yacimientos Pe-trolferos Fiscales, the national oil company. It has been
before the Senate since November.
The senate, where the government has a majority, does not oppose
privatisation of YPF, but there are objections to clauses by which the
government would sell the company to private investors, local government and
employees.
Senators are also agitating for a softer government line over imposing tough
economic reforms on the country's 24 provinces.
The government is under permanent pressure from militant pensioners to
increase their monthly benefit, equivalent to Dollars 150. Argentina has one
of South America's largest contingents of old people and spends Dollars 10bn
a year (over 7 per cent of GDP) on pensions. However, benefits are lower
than those stipulated by law.
Pensioners are entitled to benefits equivalent to 82 per cent of their final
wage. However, the bankrupt state pension fund was unable to match this and
has built up a Dollars 10bn 'debt' to pensioners. The government has cleared
Dollars 7bn of that by issuing bonds, but it must recapitalise the pension
fund to avoid creating a new, unsustainable deficit.
Sale of YPF would yield some Dollars 4bn-Dollars 5bn over the next three
years and Mr Menem promises that the money would be channeled to the pension
fund. The sale would be the crowning glory of the government's privatisation
programme. Mr Menem plans to sell all federal companies, except YPF, by the
end of the year.
However, his challenge to Congress has not impressed the pensioners'
leaders, who denounced his ploy as a cynical manoeuvre. Opposition members
of Congress dismissed it as 'dictatorial'.
Mr Menem also demanded that Congress approve unaltered a draft social
security reform package. This would reshape the tax structure and create
compulsory private schemes to which employees would contribute 11 per cent
of their incomes.

WARRING Sunni and Shia Moslem guerrilla factions took hundreds of civilians
hostage in Kabul with Afghanistan's new coalition government apparently
powerless to stop them, witnesses said yesterday, Reuter reports from Kabul.
The prisoners were singled out in the street at gunpoint on the basis of
their ethnic group and taken to makeshift detention centres scattered around
the city, the witnesses said.
Fighters of the Sunni Moslem and mainly ethnic Pashtun Ittehad-i-Islami
group took away ethnic Hazaras, who are Shia Moslems, while the rival
Hezb-i-Wahdat group seized Pashtuns. Mr Gulbuddin Hekmatyar, hardline leader
of the powerful Hezb-i-Islami party, threatened to intervene in the fighting
and accused the ruling coalition, which he has not joined, of being weak and
incompetent. The crumbling coalition is struggling to impose its authority
over about 10 main factions which moved into the city in April after 14
years of civil war.

Seven months after Mr Moi bowed to international pressure and introduced a
multi-party political system the genie of tribalism, bottled up and obscured
during the repressive years of one-party rule, has exploded onto the
political scene.
Ethnicity and not ideology is now the key to the country's political future
and the outcome of the general election expected within nine months.
The Forum for Restoration of Democracy (Ford), an opposition coalition which
six months ago offered so much promise, has disintegrated into predominantly
ethnicity-based factions and parties while barely a day goes by without
violent clashes and deaths. The mounting ethnic fragmentation is threatening
the transition to democracy.
The failure of Kenya, after 28 years of independence, to have achieved a
sense of national identity and compete in forthcoming polls on the basis of
alternative political and economic strategies has raised concern in both
government and opposition.
Mr Paul Muite, a senior Ford leader, conceded recently that, despite the
hopes of the younger generation of politicians, Ford had no alternative but
to base its political campaign on a cynical appeal for tribal votes and
alliances. At the other end of the political spectrum one of Kenya's most
senior civil servants said his belief in nearly three decades of development
and 'nation building' had been shattered by the explosion of tribalism. 'Ask
me what the difference is between all the people running for president in
terms of their policies and I haven't a clue,' he said.
These rivalries and tensions are exacerbated by the fact that the economy is
in severe depression. Gross domestic product growth slowed to 2.2 per cent
in 1991, down from 4.3 per cent in 1990 - a real per capita income decline
of between 1.5 and 2 per cent.
Tribalist political fears are also intensified by competition for jobs,
rising land hunger and a Westminster constitution which, based on a
winner-takes-all principle, may be unable to accommodate the concerns of
minority tribes being marginalised by political change.
Those fears are particularly pronounced in Kenya given the political
tradition that the tribe that has won the presidency has favoured its own.
While many countries have pork-barrel politics, in Kenya it extends to the
provision of the most basic services such as clinics, schools or roads.
Critics argue that President Moi's warning that multi-party politics would
lead to tribal rivalry was a self-fulfilling prophecy, claiming that
government has instigated the violence in western Kenya that has claimed 300
lives over the past three months. The allegation has been supported by the
clergy and opposition politicians. The government denies the charges.
Whatever the truth, it is clear that the years since independence have
provided only a veneer of a national identity.  Fundamental divisions
remain.
Furthermore the bitter historical political cleavages of colonial Kenya are
beginning to re-emerge. Before independence in 1963 there were two political
parties, Kadu and Kanu, which pitted the federalist Kalenjin, Luhya and
other minority tribes who feared political submersion against the centralist
Kikuyu and Luo tribes.
With Ford looking increasingly dominated by the Luo and the Kikuyu a complex
political operation appears to be taking shape led by Mr Martin Shikuku, a
Luhya and currently a senior Ford official, to lead the Luhya back to Kanu
under Mr Moi, a Kalenjin. Both Mr Moi and Mr Shikuku were leaders of Kadu
before the two parties merged at independence.
Part of the explanation to the strength of tribal politics lies in the way
political power has been used since independence. In his 14 years in office
President Moi first sought to redress the imbalance in favour of the Kikuyu
tribe left by former president Jomo Kenyatta. But in the later years of his
rule he has turned the Kalenjin tribe from a disadvantaged minority to a
dominating elite occupying a disproportionate share of senior government and
parastatal jobs which has left the Kikuyu in particular feeling they have
been marginalised.
Many Kenyans are coming to realise that before this minority can be
persuaded to surrender power through the ballot box it and its allies will
have to be convinced that they will not be expelled from the political arena
altogether.

A CONTROVERSIAL amnesty exonerating Thai military officers who ordered last
month's shooting of pro-democracy demonstrators remained in force yesterday
after the Constitutional Tribunal said it could not make a ruling on the
matter, writes Victor Mallet in Bangkok. Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon issued the
amnesty covering both demonstrators and the security forces shortly before
he resigned as prime minister 10 days ago.
Opposition groups have demanded that army officers responsible for the
deaths of at least 49 demonstrators be punished, and they have warned of
further turmoil if the amnesty remains. They challenged its legality because
it was not issued by the cabinet.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIAN aborigines yesterday threatened an avalanche of land claims,
after a High Court judgment had recognised the existence of land titles
pre-dating European settlement in 1788.
The High Court ruled that the Miriam people of the Murray Islands, part of
the Torres Strait islands group off the north coast of mainland Australia,
had retained ownership of their land under common law.
The court restricted its judgment to the Murrays, and ruled that the concept
of 'native title' could exist only where such rights had not been
extinguished by the government.
However, aboriginal leaders said the judgment challenged the legal status of
the Australian government, which relies for its legitimacy on the claim that
the country was terra nullius when annexed by Britain.
This signifies that the land was effectively unoccupied, or occupied by
people who lacked a system of land tenure which would have inhibited
annexation and settlement.
The concept is regarded as a significant obstacle to land rights claims by
aborigines, who account for less than 1 per cent of Australia's 17m
population, but claim ownership of much of the country.
Mr Galarrwuy Yunupingu, chairman of the aboriginal Northern Lands Council,
said the federal government would face 'a barrage of litigation' unless it
moved quickly to negotiate a treaty with aborigines. 'The pathetic excuse of
terra nullius is now dead,' Mr Yunupingu said.
The court decision was 'a turning point in the history of this country, and
it kills off all the nonsense that Aboriginal people don't exist. It sets a
whole new precedent for aboriginal people,' he added.
Mr David Allen, the Lands Council's senior legal adviser, said 'significant
numbers' of aboriginal people would have a 'reasonable prospect' of
succeeding in land claims based on the decision.

ISRAEL said yesterday it would have to suspend new aircraft engine contracts
with General Electric (GE), a big supplier to the Israeli air force,
following corruption allegations involving GE and Israeli officials.
Israeli defence officials said that new contracts for GE engines would be
halted in line with the Pentagon's own suspension of dealings with GE's
engines division, announced on Tuesday. Pentagon approval is required for
Israeli military purchases in the US under conditions attached to the US
aid.
The moves are the latest in a long-running scandal over abuse by Israeli
procurement officers of US military aid. The US government has filed charges
against officials in GE's engines division, alleging they conspired with
Rami Dotan, jailed ex-head of Israeli air force procurement, to defraud the
US military sales programme of Dollars 40m (Pounds 22.2m).

FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: Pact to limit pension costs hit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE future of an agreement to limit the cost of equalising pensions for men
and women across Europe has been effectively snuffed out by the Danish vote
against the Maastricht treaty.
The treaty had included a protocol, quietly introduced by the Dutch
government, which said that, although companies could not allow women to
retire earlier than men and still earn equal benefits, they only needed to
do so after May 17, 1990.
On that date, the European Court, in a landmark case known as Barber vs.
Guardian Royal Exchange, had ruled that pensions are effectively deferred
pay and that companies may not discriminate in pay offered to men and women.
Equalising pensions retrospectively in Britain could have cost up to Pounds
50bn, according to industry estimates. In the Netherlands, companies could
face a bill of up to Pounds 30bn. Belgium and Ireland could face costs of up
to Pounds 15bn and Pounds 500m respectively. Other countries could also be
affected.
The protocol provided the narrowest and least expensive interpretation of
retrospective payments from the employers' point of view. It meant current
pensioners would not be eligible for any enhancement in benefits and a man
halfway through his working career would be eligible for improved pension
benefits only for the period from May 17, 1990.
If the EC fails to revive the Maastricht agreement, European governments
will have to await a decision by the European Court in October, after it has
heard a case brought by the trustees of the Coloroll pension fund, along
with two other cases involving retired people in Germany and the
Netherlands.
That decision will determine the extent to which companies are expected to
provide equal pension benefits retrospectively.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Maastricht in the Balance: British premier pledges steps to
decentralise EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANY 'substantial renegotiation' of the Maastricht treaty to take account of
its rejection by Danish voters was not a practical proposition at present,
Mr John Major, the British prime minister, warned yesterday.
He again resisted demands from both sides of the House of Commons for a
direct test of the views of the British people by insisting that a
referendum would be incompatible with Britain's system of representative
government.
Mr Major agreed with Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, that consideration
of the bill implementing the treaty should be temporarily postponed, but
rejected demands that it should be dropped altogether. He said 'The treaty
itself has not changed, and neither has my view of the treaty'.
The prime minister made it clear to the apparently increasing number of Tory
backbench critics of Maastricht that his view had the support of a united
cabinet.
He promised that Britain would use its six months' presidency of the EC,
beginning in July, to carry forward the move to decentralisation through
increasing use of inter-government agreements not subject to the terms of
the Treaty of Rome or the judgment of the European Court. Mr Major
emphasised that the treaty provided mechanisms for more broadly based
development of the EC.
'The ratification and implementation of the treaty is in our national
interest, and we shall continue during our presidency to work for the
Community we secured in that negotiation,' he said.
Mr John Biffen, MP for Shropshire north and one of the 22 Tory backbench
rebels who earlier voted against the second reading of the Maastricht bill,
underlined the need for further institutional reform in the EC which
enhanced the role of inter-governmental co-operation and, correspondingly,
contracted the centralising consequences of the Rome treaty.
The prime minister stressed that it was a British initiative which marked
the move away from centralism at Maastricht and assured the House: 'There is
no doubt that is the direction in which we must continue to move as we take
over the presidency.'
Mr Tony Benn, MP for Chesterfield and a member of the Labour cabinet
primarily responsible for securing the referendum on Britain's continued
membership of the EC in 1975, said the Danes had 'struck a blow for every
country in Europe, not just their own'.
He forecast that the outcome of the Danish referendum would be seen to have
opened the way for a different sort of Europe, harmonising by consent in
inter-governmental co-operation and providing the opportunity for a
commonwealth of European states rather than a federation.
Sir Edward Heath, the former Conservative prime minister who took Britain
into the EC in 1973, praised Mr Major's firm stance. He said 'The basic
thing for us is to press ahead.'

FT  04 JUN 92 / Small business groups see EC threat
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SMALL business groups around Europe are concerned that the European
Commission's enterprise directorate is to be abolished or is to be merged
into the industry directorate with the loss of an independent voice for
small companies.
A delegation of European MPs and representatives of small business
organisations throughout Europe will argue the case for a continued strong
voice for small business in meetings with government ministers in Portugal -
present chairman of the European Commission - tomorrow.
The European Committee for Small and Medium sized Independent Companies
(Europmi) has written an open letter to Mr Jaques Delors, commission
president, seeking his assurance that the enterprise directorate (DG 23)
will not be abolished.
An official of the directorate yesterday denied any knowledge of plans to
abolish or merge it but small business organisations believe the directorate
is threatened by proposals to simplify the commission structure.
They also suspect that the directorate's monitoring of the impact of
proposed EC legislation has angered other departments, according to Mr Brian
Prime, president of Europmi and European representative of the Federation of
Small Businesses, a UK small firms lobby group.
Small business concerns about the future of the directorate have coincided
with a review by independent consultants of the effectiveness of its small
business programmes. Their preliminary report is due next month.
While some small business organisations are opposed to any change in the
status of the enterprise directorate others would be willing to see it
merged with the industry directorate (DG 3) as long as it retained a
distinct identity.
'The interests of small and medium-sized companies need to be given more
weight in Europe. If this is the best way to do it then I am prepared to
consider it,' said Ms Kala Paijs, president of the small firms' group of
European MPs and a member of the delegation to Portugal.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Berlin to take contested properties: City acts to end
deadlock over more than DM10bn in rival claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BERLIN'S city government, in a landmark decision, has ruled that more than
DM10bn (Pounds 3.4bn) in east Berlin properties claimed by companies and
private individuals will instead be taken over by the city.
Mr Steffen Kammradt, spokesman of the Berlin Finance Office, said the
ruling, expected to be legally challenged by former owners, allowed the city
to end the deadlock in rebuilding east Berlin caused by rival property
claims.
He estimated that 'considerably more' than DM10bn in property was affected.
Among the most valuable real estate to revert to the city is a sprawling
site on Leipziger Platz, near the former Berlin Wall, which previously
belonged to the Jewish-owned Wertheim department store chain, now part of
the Hertie group.
Prime sites owned by the Hohenzollern family, descendants of the former
German Kaiser, were also affected by the decision.
A total of 589 companies and 951 property sites, mainly in the inner-city
Mitte district, are being claimed by the city.
The decision runs counter to a previous 'recommendation' by the German
government that the properties, which were confiscated shortly after East
Germany was established in October 1949, should be returned to the previous
owners.
Only properties previously confiscated by the Soviet occupation
administration (SMAD) from former Nazi activists, war criminals and persons
who 'aryanised' Jewish property in the 1930s were not to be given back. This
was acknowledged by the Germans in their unification treaty of 1990.
The Berlin Justice Office, however, issued a legal opinion this week that
East Germany's confiscation of the east Berlin properties was merely an
administrative act carrying out a sovereign decision in 1946 by the SMAD.
Mr Kammradt said the way was now clear for the city-owned properties to be
developed by investors who could well include some of the former owners.
It was up to the Bonn government to decide whether restitution would be paid
to former Jewish owners, their heirs, or the Jewish Claims Commission, he
said.

INVESTIGATIONS into Milan's multi-billion lire corruption scandal have taken
a decisive turn with the arrival in Rome of legal papers calling for
parliamentary immunity for five politicians implicated in the inquiry to be
lifted.
The list includes two prominent Socialists, Mr Carlo Tognoli, the outgoing
minister of sport, and Mr Paolo Pillitteri, elected to parliament in April.
Both are former mayors of Milan, and Mr Pillitteri is the brother-in-law of
Mr Bettino Craxi, the Socialist party leader.
Separately in Milan, the role of big industrial companies has come further
into the spotlight with the decision by Mr Ivo Braglia, the head of the
transport division of the Italian subsidiary of the multinational Asea Brown
Boveri (ABB) engineering group, to testify voluntarily before investigating
magistrates.
ABB is one of a number of big engineering companies which supplied equipment
for the city's third underground railway line, which has been one of most
important infrastructure projects being investigated by magistrates.
Until now, inquiries had focused on Fiat's Cogefar-Impresit construction and
civil engineering subsidiary. Its managing director, Mr Enzo Papi, has been
in prison for the past month as a result of his refusal to co-operate with
magistrates.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A BROAD cross-party coalition yesterday elected Mr Giorgio Napolitano, a
veteran former communist and member of the Party of the Democratic Left
(PDS), as Speaker of Italy's chamber of deputies.
Mr Napolitano, 66, was proposed by the PDS and backed by the Christian
Democrats, Socialists, Republicans and Social Democrats. The same alliance -
without the Republicans - led to the election on May 25 of Mr Oscar Luigi
Scalfaro, the then-Speaker, as Italy's ninth president.
Despite misgivings and internal divisions, Mr Achille Occhetto, the PDS
leader, has thus twice in recent days led his party into alliances with his
former opponents, the Christian Democrats, or rivals, the Socialists. He has
said this does not commit the PDS, the second largest party in parliament,
with 16 per cent of the vote, to form part of the next government; but it
has set a precedent.
Another sign of change in the political scene has been a statement by
President Scalfaro that he would like the next prime minister to form a
cabinet of his own choosing and not depend upon the traditional dictates of
the party bosses. With a new Speaker, the formal process of consultations to
form a new government can now begin.
The election of a PDS Speaker was seen, in part, as a trade-off for
supporting Mr Scalfaro's election to the presidency. Mr Napolitano had been
proposed two months ago for the job, when parliament first convened after
the April 5 general elections; but the Christian Democrats pressed for one
of their own in the form of Mr Scalfaro.
Neither the Christian Democrats nor the Socialists backed the PDS's first
candidate, Prof Stefano Rodota, the party's president and former visiting
law fellow at All Souls, Oxford. The Socialists, in particular, view him too
much of an internal PDS choice. Prof Rodota was forced to withdraw after
four rounds of abortive voting, and yesterday resigned as party president.
The party's decision to drop his candidature has provoked criticism of Mr
Occhetto's leadership by those who regard him as over-anxious to do a deal
with the Christian Democrats and Socialists.

Robinson previews the republic's election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM the grimy industrial town of Teplice, just 20km from the German border,
elections this weekend to the parliament of the Czech republic look like a
one-horse race.
Larger than life-size portraits of a sternly paternal Vaclav Klaus, federal
finance minister and leader of the Civic Democratic Party (ODS), dominate
squares and billboards. The local ODS party offices, in the turret of a
heavily German-baroque mansion, are staffed with two paid officials and
equipped with computer terminals, fax machines and copiers.
Across town a battered red tin sign marks the closed campaign offices of the
communist party, led by Mr Jiri Svoboda. Next door a sign on the social
democrat office, in a similarly run-down block, says it keeps regular office
hours but is also closed.
The former Palace of Culture has been converted into the Palm Beach Disco,
and Czech and foreign cars line the streets. But there are complaints that
life has got harder and people less friendly since market reforms brought
higher prices, rising unemployment and unaccustomed insecurity.
Time after time, however, after complaining bitterly, people like Mrs Vera
Vachudova, with two small boys and a husband now self-employed after losing
his job, said they would vote for Mr Klaus as 'the man who will make things
better'.
In Prague and the other big towns and cities 'left-wing' parties such as the
communists and the social democrats led by Mr Walter Komarek are expected to
gain about 10 per cent of the vote each, reflecting historical allegiances
dating back to the pre-war republic. But if Teplice and the other smaller
industrial towns are any guide, voters in the Czech lands seem likely to
vote decisively in favour of persevering with the painful economic and
social changes which bring with them the promise of future prosperity and
re-integration into the community of Europe.
Czechs and Slovaks will be voting this weekend both for republican
parliaments and a new federal parliament. The results are being watched for
signs of a possible split between the two regions as Slovak politicians make
louder noises about breaking away from the federation.
Around Teplice, in the former Sudetenland, annexed by Hitler after the 1938
Munich agreement and forcibly cleared of ethnic Germans after the war, the
full ugliness of Soviet-style economic planning is clear.
The valleys are choked with fumes from hundreds of tall chimneys that have
reduced life expectancy to four years below the national average and killed
forests in the hills which mark the German borders. Once elegant city
centres have been allowed to crumble. Workers brought in to work in the
glass, cement, steel and engineering plants are housed in serried rows of
identical flats and the entire region is dotted with coal or lignite-fired
power stations surrounded by kilometre-long waste dumps.
Surrounded by the evidence of recent failure and past prosperity it is
difficult to detect nostalgia for the old regime or much interest in the
'third way' gradualism and mixed economy thinking espoused by Mr Komarek of
the social democrats.
Over the last two years the number of heavily laden trucks thundering past
the town to and from the German border, which also marks entry into the
wider EC market, has risen dramatically. One of the town's biggest
employers, Sklo-Union, the country's biggest glass company, was one of the
first state enterprise to form a joint venture with foreign investors. The
company, now 67 per cent owned by Glaverbell, a Belgian glass company
controlled by Asahi glass of Japan, has cut 1,500 jobs but invested heavily
and raised sales by 25 per cent.
Success stories such as this have made north and western Bohemia prime areas
for foreign, largely German, investment. For voters here, an election result
that reassures foreign investors and guarantees future prosperity appears to
be more important than the question of future relations with far-off
Slovakia.
In Prague, Mr Vladimir Dlouhy, the federal economics minister who heads the
Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA), expects to form a market reform orientated
coalition government with Mr Klaus's party and others after the elections.
He says that the crisis over Slovak demands for greater national sovereignty
is largely due to mistakes by Czech politicians.
'I think we would live better if we stayed together. But it would be better
to arrange a civilised divorce than an unworkable federation,' he argues in
a way which reflects a growing Czech willingness to contemplate a split
which public opinion polls show the majority of Czechs and Slovaks still
oppose.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Gwent (8): The valleys' new role - Robin Reeves on
successors to heavy industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN REEVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GWENT contains an abundance of valleys, from the Black Mountains in the
north of the county to the Wye Valley in the south. But for those who live
there, the Gwent valleys mean one thing - the coal-mining valleys of the
west of the county.
This part of Gwent was in the forefront of the 19th industrial revolution.
But the traditional iron, steel and coal industries having declined to a
shadow of their former importance, these particular valleys are having to
build new economic and social foundations.
The pressures of economic change in this part of Gwent are not new. A
sustained effort has been going for decades to diversify local employment
opportunities as the number of jobs available in coal and steel has
declined. The industrial estates along the Heads of the Valleys and at
strategic locations within the valleys themselves bear witness to the
progress those efforts have made over the years.
Long before garden festivals were thought of, the Rassau industrial estate
was carved out of the mountainside above Ebbw Vale by the fledgling Welsh
Development Agency to create a pole of attraction for new industries. It was
clear that thousands of new jobs would be needed once iron and steel-making
was ended at British Steel's Ebbw Vale works and the site confined to the
manufacture of tinplate. The closure of the 'heavy end' of Ebbw Vale in 1978
brought to an end more than 200 years of steel-making in the valley.
Over the past decade, the pace of industrial change has accelerated,
catapulting the Gwent valleys into a new era. In 1981, there were still at
least 5,000 men employed in the county's remaining deep mines. Today, deep
mining has ceased altogether; leaving just a few open-cast operations as a
reminder of the coal industry's former pre-eminence.
Nevertheless, diversification has being going ahead. The roll call of
Japanese, US and German, as well as UK companies, which have
long-established, successful operations in the area, is impressive. Some of
the smaller companies, particularly from elsewhere in the UK, may have been
initially attracted by the financial assistance available (the upper ends of
the valleys have long enjoyed development area status and the lower ends
intermediate area status).
But for every cowboy operation simply seeking to take advantage of the
grants available before moving on, dozens of others have put down firm roots
in the area, grown and prospered.
More inward investment is always wanted. But there is considerable effort
these days to encourage local enterprise. Torfaen Borough Council, the local
authority in Gwent eastern valley, has had considerable success in building
and letting starter business units on easy-in, easy-out tenancy terms and
'make and display' units which give tenants a shop window for their products
as well as manufacturing space. In spite of the severity of the recession,
none of its tenants has suffered a forced liquidation.
While inquiries for business starter units are running at record levels,
officials are uncertain whether this reflects the beginnings of an economic
recovery or the fact that morepeople fear being made redundant and are
therefore exploring the possibility of launching their own business
ventures.
One consequence of the ending of coal-mining - together with the long-term
programme of derelict land reclamation introduced in the wake of the Aberfan
disaster - has been the return of the Gwent valleys to their former natural
beauty. But while the natural environment has greatly improved, the same
cannot be said of some of the valley towns.
They have suffered the same lack of private investment in shops, offices and
other commercial premises as have the inner city areas of England.
A sustained drive has now been launched by the WDA, Gwent County Council and
other agencies to modernise and improve several of these centres and their
environments.
Work being carried out under urban development and regeneration programmes
includes a new town centre by-pass at Crumlin; improvements to retail
premises and the town centre environment at Blackwood and Newbridge; support
for new retail developments as well as a new bypass at Pontypool; investment
of Pounds 665,000 in 1992-93 town centre improvement in Abertillery; and
Pounds 400,000 in an major planning study of Tredegar, designed to revive
that town's economy.
Private sector pump-priming is essential if the Gwent valleys are to build
on the boost given to what promises to be another steadily developing
industry of the future - tourism.
There is an exceptionally rich industrial history. Blaenafon, at the head of
Gwent's 'Eastern Valley' is not just the location of Big Pit, the colliery
preserved as a museum to commemorate the South Wales coalfield, which now
attracts 160,000 visitors a year.
It was also at Blaenafon that Sidney Gilchrist Thomas invented the Basic
Open Hearth Process for steelmaking by showing that iron ore containing
phosphorus could be made into steel by lining the furnace with limestone.
This was a crucial industrial breakthrough in the 19th century, opening the
way for the development of the steel industry in the US (by Andrew Carnegie)
and in Germany where it is known to this day as the Thomas process.
The political history of the area is also colourful. The Chartists'
insurrection in 1839, in support of basic democratic reforms, when large
crowds marched down the Gwent valleys to Newport, to be fired upon by troops
and see their leaders seized and transported to Australia, is still
commemorated annually.
In this century, Aneurin Bevan, who was born in Tredegar, represented
neighbouring Ebbw Vale in parliament for over 30 years. His political
accomplishments, most notably the National Health Service which he
established as Minister of Health in the 1945-50 Labour Government, grew out
of his experience as a boy collier and miners' agent in the Gwent valleys.
Before long, people may begin visiting the area in search of the political
roots of two other political names associated with the Gwent valleys - Mr
Michael Foot and Mr Neil Kinnock. Mr Foot succeeded Bevan in 1961 as MP for
Ebbw Vale (called today, after boundary changes, Blaenau Gwent) and
represented the constituency at Westminster until the recent general
election. Mr Kinnock continues as MP for Islwyn (previously Bedwellty), a
constituency covering the bulk of Gwent's Western Valley which he has
represented since 1970.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Gwent (7): 'Most exciting science park' - Celtic lakes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANCE meeting between Dr Eric Ash, rector of Imperial College of Science
and Technology, and Mr David Waterstone, then chief executive of the Welsh
Development Agency, led to the creation of what has been described as the
'the most exciting science park to be built in Britain'.
Imperial College, part of London University and a world-renowned leader in
the field of science and technology, was looking to expand its science park,
a small unit of about three to four acres housed at Ascot, Berkshire. That
building was full, while Imperial's premises, next to the Victoria and
Albert Museum and the Natural Science Museum in London's South Kensington,
offered no scope for expansion.
Mr Waterstone seized his chance. Why did Imperial not come to Wales, to a
site in Newport that the agency wanted to develop in conjunction with the
borough council and Gwent County Council? In travelling time, it was little
further from Imperial College than Ascot since trains ran every hour through
the day from Newport into Paddington in about 100 minutes. With modern
communications anyone in Newport could talk through computer links to
Imperial College just as easily as if he or she were in the next room.
Dr Ash was intrigued. Some time after, a report in the Financial Times
alerted other parts of Britain to Imperial's intention to move its science
park to Wales. The college was bombarded with proposals that it should look
elsewhere.
This was an anxious time for the Welsh Development Agency as Imperial felt
bound to consider several other suggestions, though in the end it stuck by
its decision to put its science park in Newport.
The first building, an innovation centre, on what has been named Imperial
Park has just been completed and the first tenants are on the point of
moving in. Dr Gwyn Jones, the WDA's chairman, who has already paid one visit
to Japan to 'sell' the idea of Imperial Park as a place for high-quality
research allied to the college, is enthusiastic about the project.
'This science park will put Wales on the map as one of the most
technologically advanced places in which to work,' he says. 'Imperial Park
will become the science park by which all the others will be judged. With
Imperial's reputation and our development and marketing ability, the economy
of Wales will be given an enormous lift.'
Imperial Park is, in fact, only part of a much larger Pounds 250m
development that is taking place on the western edge of Newport and that
goes under the name Celtic Lakes. This area is being developed by a
partnership between Trencherwood, the Newbury-based concern in Berkshire,
which has long owned land on the site, and the Bassaleg Group, a local
concern which is closely linked to London and Cardiff Properties, the
development arm of a local entrepreneur, Mr Bruce Woodstock.
Celtic Lakes covers some 170 acres and is a joint venture between the two
private sector concerns and the WDA and Newport from the public sector. In
the first phase of the development, Imperial together with the WDA and
Newport will work on 50 acres while the two private sector concerns will
have some 60 acres. In the second phase Imperial has a further 28 acres with
Celtic Lakes holding the remainder.
Imperial Park's innovation centre, covering 25,000 sq ft, will be let, on
two floors, in units down to 500 sq ft with direct communications links to
Imperial College in London. A second sister building next door is expected
to be ready next year.
Mr Bruce Woodhead of Celtic Lakes says that work on its first building,
actually two 15,000 sq ft buildings linked by an atrium, should start soon
so that it is ready for occupation in the summer of next year. He is looking
for rents in the area of Pounds 12.50-14 a sq ft, the higher figure being
the top of the market at the moment in nearby Cardiff. A marketing launch
will begin in the autumn.
Imperial's rents would be lower since its clientele would be rather
different, researchers and scientists working at the leading edge of science
and technology. With its smaller units it is looking at about Pounds 8.50 a
sq ft.
Like the other major science parks in Britain, such as Trinity in Cambridge
and Heriot-Watt in Edinburgh, Imperial hopes that its tenants will
eventually grow larger and move out, it is hoped, into larger premises on
the Celtic Lakes estate.
When completed, the science and business park comprising Celtic Lakes will
offer some 2m sq ft of space.
Mr Graham Moore, the WDA's property director, says that the joint venture
between the four partners involved in Celtic Lakes, will 'ensure that the
development linking the science park and the business park will go ahead
with quality always in mind.'
Both he and Mr Woodhead say that tenants are 'on the horizon'. The WDA is
marketing Imperial Park 'very heavily', Mr Moore says, 'and one or two major
companies have already expressed strong interest'. Mr Woodhead says even the
institutions are interested in the site.
In the present climate that is quite an achievement because Celtic Lakes is
not a stand-alone development. TSB and Panasonic have been adjoining
inhabitants for some years and across the A48, which links Newport and
Cardiff, Gwent County Council together with Newport and the WDA is
developing the Gwent Technology Park. This park has, for some years, been
home to the research and development activities of AB Electronics, the
international concern.
Next door to this technology park the London-based Portico Estates is
developing, in conjunction with University College, Cardiff, what was
intended to be a science park but which now has more of a business park
theme. This developer, too, is talking of a potential client.
Visitors to Celtic Lakes can now see the distinct outlines of the park
created by London architects Aukett Associates. Water features are in place,
the roads are completed and the paths are laid down. Mr Woodhead says the
number of trees and shrubs planted have probably not been exceeded by any
other British business park.
'We see the site competing with the very best, with the likes of Aztec West
in Bristol, the Birmingham Business Park, Stockley Park near London's
Heathrow Airport or the Solent Business Park outside Southampton. But this
is not just a British park; it is intended to be able to compete with the
very best in Europe, too.'
Those are large claims, but there are plenty of people in Wales who believe
not only that Celtic Lakes, incorporating Imperial Park, will succeed but
that it will enormously enhance the standing and attraction of the Welsh
economy as well.

THIS YEAR has a Spanish flavour, so perhaps it is not surprising that Wilson
Bowden Properties has named the centrepiece of its Langstone Park
development Columbus House. Whether the name presages deeper associations
with the Iberian peninsula has yet to be revealed, but next February the
first office block, comprising 55,000 sq ft, on the site will be ready for
occupation at Pounds 12 a sq ft.
Mr Nigel Webb, of agents Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, says the building,
which is a joint venture with the Welsh Development Agency, occupies 'one of
the best positions in Britain'. Mr Robert Grafton, Wilson's development
manager, agrees.
But then, they have a vested interest in ensuring the commercial success of
the building, which is part of a Pounds 70m development.
Mr Graham Moore, the Welsh Development Agency's property director, is a more
dispassionate observer since the agency takes an overview on all property
matters in Wales. 'You have only to look at its situation to see how it can
appeal,' he says. 'It sits on junction 24 of the M4, is no more than 15
minutes from the Severn Bridge and will not be far from the Welsh end of the
second Severn crossing when that bridge is opened in 1996.
'In addition, it has two hotels virtually at the entrance to the park, which
is important not just to business users but also for the conference
facilities they provide.'
However, Langstone Park is, as Mr Moore is quick to point out, only one of
several sites being marketed in Gwent. Signs of increasing activity are
beginning to be seen elsewhere in this part of the country.
At the exit to the Severn bridge, on junction 22, Newhouse Park is a
distribution park with clients like Tesco, Nestle and Littlewoods already in
occupation. Esso has just completed a service station at junction 23 where
land is ripe for development if only the two local authorities, Monmouth and
Newport, could agree on what sort of activity should occupy the site -
distribution says Newport, offices says Monmouth.
Then at junction 28 two major developments are pencilled in. First there is
Celtic Lakes, a joint operation between Trencherwood, Bassaleg Group,
Newport and the WDA, which will contain within it the Imperial Park, in
which London's Imperial College is to have its science park. Mr Gwyn Jones,
chairman of the WDA, has described this as 'one of the most important
developments to take place in Wales. It will put the principality on the
international map as a centre for research and development.'
Trencherwood and partners are undertaking a B1 office development within
which Imperial Park will be an integral, but separate, part. Celtic Lakes,
the name for the whole, will comprise 170 acres in all and the
infrastructure is already in place. Trencher- wood-Bassaleg will develop 50
acres in phase one and Imp- erial Park will cover 60 acres, with room for a
further phase.
Altogether, 2m sq ft of space will be available when the site is fully
developed, creating several thousand jobs. Imperial's core block, the
Innovation Centre, is already up and the first client is about to sign the
necessary forms.
Across the road, in Cleppa Park, Portico Estates has been quietly putting
together a development that began, in conjunction with Cardiff University,
as a science park but with the arrival of Imperial College has turned into
another B1 development, albeit with a touch of academe. An announcement is
expected soon about a developer from the south-east who, with Danish
finance, would kick off the project.
Next door to Cleppa Park, the Gwent Technology Park is taking shape, a joint
venture between the WDA, Gwent County Council and Newport.
In all these, the WDA is playing a central role. Its portfolio in Gwent runs
to 36 estates, comprising 466 units providing just under 4.8m sq ft. Without
its presence, it is doubtful if the property market would be sustainable.
Institutional finance has alway been unwilling to commit itself to Wales and
so the agency has had to underpin the market to show outside interests that
Wales is as viable a market as, say, the West Midlands or the Manchester
area.
That policy, which has seen the WDA become the largest property-linked
agency in Europe, has had some success recently and that will have great
significance for the future. Institutional finance has arrived in Cardiff
and now it has spread from the Welsh capital to Gwent.
Last year Allied Dunbar paid Pounds 3m for a property in Newport and CIN
Properties paid Pounds 4m for the remainder of Llantarnam Park in Cwmbran,
just north of Newport.
These may be small beginnings but they are significant because it is the
agency's policy to be self-funding and so property realisations will be an
important factor in the success or failure of that policy.
In the financial year 1991-92 the agency raised about Pounds 55m in property
transactions, Pounds 26m of it in capital sales and some Pounds 30m in
rents. This year it aims to raise Pounds 50m in capital receipts alone.
It intends not just to concen- trate on the M4 corridor, however attractive
that is commercially. 'Our policy is to draw developers north,' Mr Moore
says. 'We have plenty of sites at the top end of Gwent where the attractions
are not just scenic, being on the edge of the Brecon Beacons national park,
but also of the spine A465 Heads of the Valleys road, which links the tops
of all the industrial valleys in south Wales to the Midlands.'
The agency put up a building on the Ebbw Vale garden festival site and
received an offer for it even before the festival opened in May. Nearby it
has the Crown Business Park, actually on the A465, on the market.
It is a common perception that the valleys are 'dead' for commercial
development. Without the WDA, this feeling would persist and would therefore
be self-fulfilling. But the agency has proved it is possible to get people
interested in the valleys.
The Ebbw Vale office block is just one example. Marine colliery, just below
the festival site, one of the last pits to be working in the county at its
closure, has now been cleared and levelled and is waiting for the first
speculative blocks to be erected. Other coalmining sites are now busy
industrial areas.
Rassau, above Ebbw Vale, is the perfect example of how success can be
created from a site that is generally thought to be unprepossessing. 'Ten
years ago,' says Mr David Farnsworth, the agency's director in charge of
urban development, 'the agency was thought to have gone mad when it decided
to develop Rassau. Today, the estate provides work for 3,000 people. It
shows what can be done.'
According to Mr Webb of Debenham Tewson: 'Percep- tions about Gwent, as
about Wales itself, are now changing. There was not a lot of develop- ment
in the county in the past because people still associated it with heavy
industry. But all that has now gone. The last pit has closed and the steel
indus- try is more about computers than sweat and grime.
'So institutional support has begun to come as the international companies,
such as Panasonic, Yuasa Batteries and Trico have moved in. This will be one
of the first areas to pick up.'
Such evidence as there is shows that the pick-up may be on the way. Mr
Bernard Assinder, leader of Blaenau Gwent council, which covers the northern
part of the county, says that inquiries in the first quarter of this year
were 60 per cent higher than in the previous three months.
Both Mr Moore and Mr Webb detect quickening interest elsewhere in Gwent. The
progress at Cleppa Park supports this. So does an imminent announcement for
a 140,000 sq ft expansion in Newport and a relocation in Pontypool. All this
can only be good news.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Gwent (5): After the festival is over - Garden site will
bloom with homes and industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY MORETON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VISITORS who have been pouring into the Ebbw Vale Garden Festival every
day since the start of May could be forgiven for thinking that what they
were enjoying was just another, if more colourful, entertainment centre.
The valley of the Ebbw, once a vital part of Britain's industrial greatness,
with steelworks and coal pits, is now a place of greenery and colour. The
industrial dereliction has gone and flowers and amusements within the
festival site compete for the attention of the visitors.
But the festival, of which Ebbw Vale is the fifth to be held in Britain, was
from the start planned to have a more serious purpose than as a mere
five-month entertainment centre. It was seen as a vehicle for rehabilitating
a part of the country which had been badly hit by the structural decline of
heavy industry and the concentration of newer forms of industry elsewhere.
Although garden festivals originated in Germany, where they were intended to
help rebuild the country economically after the second world war, they were
a British idea. The first was held in Hamburg in 1951. Since then, they have
become major events not only in the German entertainment calendar but also
elsewhere, as in Holland.
Their arrival in Britain a decade ago owed much to Mr Michael Heseltine's
search for an alternative, Conservative, approach to regional policy
following the inner-city riots in London's Brixton and Liverpool's Toxteth.
The first was held in Liverpool itself, to be followed by Stoke-on-Trent,
Glasgow and Gateshead. After Ebbw Vale, there are no plans for any more.
While the festival itself is of great importance - with 2m visitors expected
by the close in October it is expected to be the largest holiday attraction
in Britain this year - what happens after the gates finally close is of even
more importance.
Mr David Farnsworth, an executive director of the Welsh Development Agency,
says that the way in which the site is subsequently developed will help to
rebuild the economy not just of Ebbw Vale itself but of south Wales too.
'What will happen is not just an exercise in building houses and factories
and offices,' he says, 'it is about changing the commonly accepted
perception of the valleys of south Wales and of Wales itself.'
The future of Ebbw Vale, he adds, lies in the hands of a partnership between
the agency, Gwent County Council and Blaenau Gwent borough council. The
three entered into partnership to prepare the site five years ago and by the
turn of the century expect to see a thriving new community of some 2,500
people, with 500 houses and 1,000 jobs on the site.
This confidence in the future is based not just on the fact that some
investors, such as Welsh Brewers, relocated a distribution depot to Ebbw
Vale more than a year before the festival opened, but by the number of
inquiries about after-use facilities being received every day.
The WDA's own 8,000 sq ft office at the entrance to the festival has already
been the subject of an offer from a data processing company that would have
employed 25 people.
'We are taking inquiries all the time,' says Mr Bob Croy- don of agents J P
Sturge. 'The visitors can see what is going on and many of them are suff-
iciently interested in the way the valley has been greened to want to return
as employers.
'House building has already started on the site, with the Bailey group, of
Cardiff, having put up homes. The first phase of our development plans
envisages immediately building 25 for rent with another 15 to follow
straight on behind. A similar number will be built for sale. A national
housebuilder is to put up 50 detached houses and, with 30 self-build plots
allocated, a quarter of the 500 houses expected on the site have already
been committed. That is encouraging progress.'
It is not just houses that will be built. The after-use plan envisages 23.5
acres being set aside for technology areas and 12.5 acres for business use.
A business park is expected to create 400 jobs, according to Mr Alan Nichol,
the WDA's man in charge of the after-use project. 'Areas now being used as
car parks will be turned into high-technology sites,' he says, 'which will
create another 700 jobs. The festival site is probably the best in south
Wales and we shall create some 1,100 jobs in all on it over the coming
years.'
'This is a development,' says Mr Bernard Assinder, leader of Blaenau Gwent
borough council, 'that will deliver the long-term regeneration we seek in
the area and make us a showpiece for urban regeneration in Britain.'
'We are talking about the second transformation of the Ebbw valley,' adds Mr
Nichol. 'The industrial revolution that brought heavy industry here over a
century ago was the first; this is the second.'
The WDA's Mr Farnsworth carefully puts the development in perspective,
though. This is not a plan for tomorrow. Investment may be in the pipeline
immediately after the festival closes on October but what the three partners
are looking to is a development over the next eight years. He sees
completion by the turn of the century rather than the turn of the year.
'Enormous changes have certainly taken place,' he says. 'We had to move 250m
cubic metres of derelict land before we could start. That is equivalent to
filling 125,000 lorries. What we had to do was to move the spoil of 100
years and more of industrial activity. We did it in three years and it cost
the agency Pounds 20m.
'Even with the infrastructure largely in place it will take 10 years to
complete the job. But it is a job that will be completed. The site is superb
and the location is excellent - just half an hour from the M4 and only 1 1/2
hours from Birmingham.
'We have the right product and through our co-operation we are tackling the
development in the right way. The secret is to work at a steady pace and to
take the developers along with us at every step. We already have Pounds 10m
of investment committed and by the end we shall have over Pounds 100m.'
Blaenau Gwent's Mr Assinder sums it up by saying that the garden festival
has acted as the catalyst for a development that will radically alter the
character of the valley. 'We would not have been able to do this in such an
imaginative way nor at such speed without a festival.'
For a Labour leader to agree in practice with the principles laid down by a
Conservative minister - Mr Michael Heseltine - a decade ago indicates the
consensus that the garden festival has created.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Gwent (3): Second leap forward - Severn airport and second
bridge planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN REEVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GWENT'S transport communications look poised to undergo as dramatic a leap
forward over the next decade as they experienced a quarter of a century ago
when the Severn bridge opened.
Before 1966, drivers of cars and lorries wishing to travel between Newport
and Bristol had either to queue up to catch the Aust ferry which plied the
river near the existing crossing, or travel northwards to cross the Severn
at Gloucester. It was a different era.
Now plans are afoot for an equally dramatic addition to Gwent's transport
infrastructure - construction of a Severnside International Airport,
offering an alternative to Heathrow and Gatwick for long-haul scheduled
services. Should the project go ahead, it will give Gwent's already
excellent communications a substantial extra dimension.
It has to be said immediately that the project is the object of considerable
scepticism locally, not least because the proposal was first put forward
more than a decade ago. Gwent County Council sought then to promote the
virtues of Severnside as the site for London's third airport in preference
to Stansted. Though the council lobbied hard, the proposal failed to win
Whitehall's support and had to be shelved.
Then, in March last year, it was announced that a privately-led consortium
had decided to take the county council's proposal off the shelf and carry
forward the scheme, whose centrepiece is the construction of a 4,000 metre
runway on land reclaimed from the Severn estuary.
Little has been heard of the project since last year's announcement, but
according to Mr Paul Boyce-Mears, managing director of the new consortium
company, Severnside International Airport, this does not denote inactivity.
'A great deal of preparatory work has been going on behind the scenes on the
design, engineering and environmental requirements of the project.'
Rather than build another Gatwick or Heathrow, the consortium's model is
Manchester airport which has gradually but steadily expanded its range of
scheduled services to the point where it now handles 11m passengers a year.
The Severnside consortium sees its project as the third leg of a triangle of
long-haul airports serving England and Wales  - the other two being
Manchester and Heathrow.
Mr Boyce-Mears admits the main obstacle still to be overcome is finance.
'During the past year the climate has not been good for winning backing for
major capital projects. However, I think we are now on the way to getting
the required finance.'
He is reasonably optimistic that the consortium will be in a position to
apply for planning permission before the summer is over and place the
necessary bill before parliament later this year. Assuming there are no
unexpected hiccups, the new airport could be open for business in five or
six years.
Mr Boyce-Mears stresses that while the project is big, it is
straightforward. It involves investment of Pounds 200m in land reclamation
to create a 4,000-metre runway capable of handling, fully-laden, the new
generation of 600-passenger Jumbos and Airbuses, and investment of a further
Pounds 500m to build a modern terminal capable of handling large quantities
of freight traffic, as well as passengers.
Airfreight traffic is currently growing at a faster rate than passenger
traffic. One of the key advantages of building the airport on reclaimed
estuarial land is that it eliminates problems of noise pollution. Mr
Boyce-Mears says the investigations they have undertaken show that the
number of people affected by the noise 'cone' created by aircraft using
Severnside would be zero - because the aircraft approaches and take-offs
would be over water. By comparison, some 500,000 people are adversely
affected by aircraft noise at Heathrow and 50,000 people at Gatwick.
Gwent's other major communications development - the go-ahead of the second
Severn bridge - has also enhanced the viability of the Severnside airport
project. It has eliminated concern that the current bridge, which carries
19m vehicles a year, compared with 6m when it first opened, could become a
serious bottleneck for traffic travelling to and from the airport. (That
said, regular traffic jams on the Chiswick flyover do not seem to have
dented Heathrow's attractions.)
The second Severn bridge is now definitely going ahead. The start of work
was signalled in April when responsibility for the existing bridge passed
from the Department of Transport to Severn River Crossing, the consortium
which will build, finance and operate the new crossing, with the help of
revenues raised from the existing crossing. The four major shareholders in
the consortium are John Laing, GTM-Entrepose, Bank of America and Barclays
de Zoete Wedd.
This change of ownership from the public to the private sector proved to be
an inauspicious occasion. Large traffic jams built up as a result of the new
consortium's decision to raise charges sharply and to begin reconstruction
immediately of the tolls plaza at Aust. Instead of vehicles having to pay a
toll travelling in either direction, they are now charged only if travelling
in a westbound direction into Wales.
Lord Hooson, chairman of the consortium, says that once the new systems are
in place, 'they will offer a much speedier passage for the 19m vehicles a
year now using the bridge.' The new bridge will be three miles long, and
three miles downstream of the existing bridge. It will have three traffic
lanes and hard-shoulders each way and wind-shielding to allow vehicles to
cross even in high winds.
Fears have been expressed in the past that a second Severn bridge could
weaken, rather than strengthen, Gwent's economy by encouraging businesses
and skills to migrate from the county to the Bristol area. The signs are
that, on the contrary, it is opening up new opportunities to strengthen the
local economy. This, too, is evidently the conclusion of a new Pieda study
on the impact of the second Severn bridge. Due to be published shortly, it
forecasts that the benefits will far outweigh any deleterious effects.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Gwent (2): A milestone for Newport - Robin Reeves looks at
the town's regeneration plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN REEVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWPORT recently passed a small but significant milestone in its economic
fortunes. For the first time in living memory, the town's level of
unemployment registered below the national average.
The current unemployment rate in Newport is 9.4 per cent, compared with an
average of 9.5 per cent for Britain as a whole. This performance is all the
more surprising in view of recent setbacks suffered by companies which in
the early 1980s were hailed as the key to Newport's future prosperity.
The most spectacular example is Inmos, which went to Newport in 1980 amid a
blaze of publicity. With substantial government financial backing (it was
said to be Britain's last chance to establish a stake in the international
semi-conductor business), the company built a state-of-the-art microchip
manufacturing plant to take on the rest of the world. Politicians and
economists alike insisted this would be the kind of sunrise industry that
brought secure, well-paid jobs to Newport, replacing those being lost in
traditional industries, such as steel and coal.
But it has not worked out that way. At its peak, Inmos employed some 1,100
on two sites in the town. But, with the onset of the recession and the sale
of Inmos by its parent company, Thorn-EMI to the French Thomson electronics
group, the company's fortunes have plummeted. The workforce is now down to
450 and there is talk of the remaining plant closing outright unless Thomson
finds a purchaser.
Other companies which expanded in Newport in the 1980s, but which have more
recently had to make lay-offs of workers include AB Electronic Products and
Marconi; though the latter cutback is due more perhaps to the ending of the
cold war than the recession. Another 1980s incomer, TSB's insurance
division, while it employs 450 and has not suffered cutbacks, no longer
talks of creating 2,000 jobs - as it promised initially.
On the other hand, the Patents Office, a recent government agency relocation
from central London, has given a significant boost to white-collar
employment. The number of staff has built up to 1,000 in a year. There are
also two major plants under construction. Northern Telecom is relocating
part of the former STC defence systems production operation in Newport to a
new site at Queensway Meadows, a move which is being interpreted as a strong
vote of confidence in Newport by STC's new owner. The same is true of Bisley
Office Equipment, which arrived from Surrey three years ago, bringing 100
jobs, and has now embarked on a second phase of expansion, creating a
further 60 jobs.
Hopes are also high that new scientific business projects will quickly be
attracted to Celtic Lakes, Wales's most significant science park-style
development to date, which lies on Newport's western outskirts. Some 50
acres of the 200-acre development, a joint venture between the council, the
Welsh Development Agency, Trencherwood Commercial and the Bassaleg Group,
has already been earmarked for R&amp;D business activities 'spun out' from
Imperial College, London.
The WDA is just putting the finishing touches to Imperial House, an advanced
communications unit on the Celtic Lakes site with direct links to London and
plans to launch an international marketing campaign very shortly. But in the
meantime - and somewhat ironically in view of what was being said a decade
ago - it is steel production and fabrication, and ancillary steel activities
which are proving to be among Newport's most stable employment sectors
during the current recession.
In 1980-82 thousands of jobs disappeared in the steel industry and there was
even talk of the Llanwern steelworks closing altogether. Yet in spite of the
massive shake-out at that time, the key role of steel and aluminium
production in the local economy - Alcan also has a major European rolling
facility at nearby Rogerstone - has not been eclipsed. Metal manufacturing
activities still employ some 7,000 people or 13 per cent of the Newport
workforce, compared with an average of 3.2 per cent occupied in this sector
in the economy as a whole.
Llanwern now has a reputation for being one of the best steel plants in the
world. Managed by British Steel in tandem with Port Talbot, its productivity
and operating efficiency will probably be enhanced even further by the
closure of Ravenscraig since the doomed Scottish plant's orders can be
switched to Wales.
Another sign of the times in steel is a recent merger between British
Steel's Orb works and SSAB, Sweden's state-owned steel producer, to create a
Pounds 100m company, European Electrical Steel, specialising in magnetic
steels for transformers and electrical motors. The new company is
headquartered in Newport.
For all the brighter spots in the local economy, Mr Brian Dunford of Newport
Borough Council's economic development team stresses there is no sense of
complacency. It remains the case that a high proportion of the employment
growth over the past decade has been in female, part-time jobs whereas those
being created have tended to be relatively well-paid unskilled male jobs.
This in turn has given rise to concern that Wales in general, and Gwent in
particular, may gain a reputation for being a low-wage, low-skill economy
which will rebound to the detriment of the growth in the services economy.
Newport recognises that it suffers from a 'doughnut syndrome' - the tendency
of new investment to be attracted to the periphery of the town, close to the
motorway, and not the centre. To counter this, the council has brought
forward a town centre regeneration strategy in conjunction with the Welsh
Development Agency which will involve pump-priming Pounds 8.5m over the next
four years. A similar regeneration scheme has been drawn up for the Pill
area of the town.
But the most ambitious regeneration scheme by far is the construction of a
Pounds 73m tidal barrage to impound the waters of the River Usk and create
the conditions necessary for the waterside redevelopment of the river banks
now strewn with 100 years of dereliction. The bill necessary to build the
barrage has been laid before parliament and is expected to enter its
committee stage in October.
Meanwhile, Newport council has already spent over Pounds 1m on feasibility
studies and environmental monitoring. Some of that has gone on assessing the
possible impact on ground water levels to avoid the kind of opposition which
occurred when such questions were raised about the Cardiff Bay barrage. If
all goes according to plan, construction of the Usk barrage will begin in
1995 and be completed in 1998, giving Newport new development sites, a new
river crossing, new housing and - its protagonists insist - new confidence.
But Newport Borough Council cannot finance the barrage itself. The project
is due to be paid for from a cocktail of sources, including government and
EC grants. Which comes back to the relative improvement in Newport's
economy. The borough treasurer's current nightmare is that this will used as
an excuse to strip the town of its assisted development area status under UK
regional policy and exclude its from Objective 2 EC regional development
grants. Lobbying to ensure that London and Brussels understand such
precipitate action would torpedo Newport's regeneration plans is already
under way.

FT  04 JUN 92 / Gwent (1): From pits to science parks - New investment has
brought high-technology industries and new skills to the county and helped
to reshape its industrial base. Progress has taken place along the M4
corridor, but infrastructure development is still needed further north
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GWENT IS a curious mixture of the affluent and the not-so-affluent. Parts of
the county around Monmouth, Usk and Abergavenny, which have acquired the
popular title of the golden triangle, have the highest average income in
Wales. Other parts, such as the borough of Torfaen above Newport, have among
the lowest.
Unemployment in a county that once had some of the heaviest industry in
Britain is not unusually high, though. The county's average of 11.6 per cent
is only slightly above that for Wales. Even Blaenau Gwent, at the top of the
valleys, has only 13.8 per cent.
Yet there is still a perception, especially in the south-east of England,
that Gwent is a place of dereliction and smoking chimneys. 'Our image is one
of the major problems to be overcome,' says Mr John Pembridge, chairman of
the county's planning and economic development committee.
'People think we are all about coal and steel: we're not. The only pit left
is a museum and the remaining steelworks are places of high technology, run
by banks of computers.
'The garden festival at Ebbw Vale, which is open until early October, has
been a marvellous opportunity for us to show people what the valleys are
really like. Once they see how green and pleasant they are, we go right to
the front of the queue as a desirable location.'
Mr Graham Moore, the Welsh Development Agency's property director, agrees.
'A feeling of confidence is coming back,' he says. 'The property market is
beginning to be more active, with developers starting to turn their plans
into more tangible forms.'
Mr Bernard Assinder, leader of Blaenau Gwent borough council, points to a 60
per cent increase in lettings in the borough in the first quarter of this
year compared with the last three months of 1991.
But not everyone is so optimistic. Mr Bruce Woodhead, managing director of
London and Cardiff Properties, which is participating in a 170-acre
development, Celtic Lakes, at Newport that will include a science park,
warns that getting new tenants is still a hard grind. 'People who have been
mulling over a new investment for some time are prepared to go ahead,' he
says. 'But it is difficult to win new decisions.'
Difficult - but not impossible. Gwent has won a lot of new investment in the
past year, which has helped to change the face of the county. Perhaps the
most important was the decision by Trico-Folberth, one of the leading
manufacturers of windscreen wipers for the motor industry, to relocate from
West London to Pontypool, creating more than 500 jobs. Also significant was
the arrival of Northern Telecom at Cwmcarn which is to increase its
workforce from 600 to around 900.
At Crumlin, Integra Plasma, a semi-conductor manufacturer, is expanding, as
is A. Schulman, an American concern, which is spending Pounds 2.1m to
increase output of plastic compounds and resins.
Tillery Valley Foods is to invest Pounds 2m in expanding production of
pre-cooked meals at Abertillery. Festive Productions is also to spend Pounds
2m to produce more Christmas decorations at Newport.
These companies, and others like them, are the new Gwent. The county that
was a base for heavy industry is now home to the industries of the late 20th
century. Electronics and information technology, financial services, motor
industry parts and food processing have replaced the belching smoke-stack
industries of the past.
Fifteen years ago, almost 40 per cent of the workforce was in mining or
manufacturing; by 1989, the last year for which figures are available, the
number was down to a third. Those employed in distribution and hotels had
risen from 14.9 to 18 per cent in the same period and banking and finance
had leapt from 2.6 to 7 per cent with the arrival of TSB Trust, the Patent
Office and the Business Statistics Office. Financial services have been a
major growth sector.
On the industrial side, AB Electronics, the electronics concern, is one of
the larger representatives of the new Gwent. 'We have designated our
Rogerstone factory, near Newport, as the flagship plant in a new drive to
attack the fast-growing market for electronic products in Europe,' says Mr
Paul Ryder, the managing director.
'Rogerstone, which employs over 800 people and has some of the largest and
most modern electronic assembly lines in Europe, will form the hub of a
cluster of AB plants in the UK and on the Continent.'
AB Electronics is not alone in the field. Incomers in recent years have
included the Japanese company Star Micronics at Tredegar, Nimbus Records at
Cwmbran, Newbridge Networks, a Canadian company, which is about to expand to
a second site, at Newport and Yuasa Battery and Aiwa, two Japanese concerns,
at Ebbw Vale and Crumlin respectively.
The financial services sector will get a massive shot in the arm with the
completion of property developments now being undertaken in and around
Newport, using the M4 motorway as a corridor. The star will be the creation
of a science park, Imperial Park, managed by and using the back-up of London
University's Imperial College.
The science park is part of a larger development, Celtic Lakes, which will
provide around 2m sq ft of prime space. Imperial House, the core building is
almost ready for occupation as an innovation centre and the science park as
a whole is being seen as a marvellous opportunity to develop the potential,
and create a new image not just for Gwent but also for the whole of Wales.
Across the road from Celtic Lakes, Gwent County Council, in conjunction with
the Welsh Development Agency, is extending its technology park that is
already home to AB Electronics' R&amp;D centre.
With the opening of a second Severn crossing, costing Pounds 270m and
scheduled for 1996, the M4 corridor in southern Gwent will be seen as a
prime attraction according to Mr Andrew Fretter, the county's head of
economic development. 'The county is already one of the most dynamic parts
of the UK in growth terms,' he says. 'It has consistently demonstrated this
by having the highest rate of VAT-registered company formations outside the
south-east of England.
'Although we have had a difficult year, like the rest of Britain, and we
have had to deal with more problems among businesses than ever before, there
is evidence that we are emerging from that troublesome period.
'Trico was a great shot in the arm but there are others coming and with the
science park we should become an international centre for research and
development.'
The problem for Gwent is to encourage new investment to move up the valleys
from the M4 corridor. It is not easy but it can be done. 'Ten years ago,
when we began work on the Rassau industrial park above Ebbw Vale and
Tredegar,' says Mr David Fallowell, the WDA's executive director, 'people
thought we would never be successful. But 3,000 people are now employed on
that estate, as well as a large number at another at nearby Tafarnaubach.'
Both Mr Fretter and Mr Fallowell believe the garden festival will act as a
catalyst to draw people north. 'Communications are excellent at the top of
the valleys,' Mr Fretter says. 'The A465 Heads of the Valleys road, which is
to be upgraded, offers a good, quick route to the West Midlands. But it is
all about image. And this is why the festival is so important.
'Everyone who comes to Ebbw Vale remarks on the site and its potential. The
tops of the valleys are our most depressed areas. New jobs and new homes
there will make an enormous impact.'
To help not just this area but the whole of the county, Gwent has adopted a
strategy which puts a premium on partnerships, not just with other public
sector bodies but also with the private sector, training initiatives and
improvements to the infrastructure. It has set up an image partnership and a
business forum and has even backed a private-sector plan for an
international airport.
With Avon County Council, on the eastern end of the Severn Bridge, anxious
to constrain further economic development, Gwent is in a fortunate position,
especially when the second Severn bridge is open, to capitalise on the need
for industry to find acceptable new homes along the M4. The restructuring
and diversification of the past 10 years, which have created a stronger
economy, look set to reap ample dividends.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Beregovoy secure despite close vote
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MORALE of France's conservative opposition parties has been boosted
following a censure motion debate in the National Assembly on Monday night
in which the government avoided defeat by the narrowest of margins.
With 286 votes out of a possible total of 576, the opposition motion only
fell three short of the absolute majority required to bring the government
down and force early elections. This is the closest the government has come
to defeat in parliament since the general election in 1988.
Although enough to give Prime Minister Pierre Beregovoy a serious fright,
and temporarily unite the warring opposition conservative parties, it is not
likely to make a fundamental difference to the balance of forces between
government and opposition.
The main reason for this is that the vote is not expected to provide any
lasting remedy to the splits which have undermined the effectiveness of
conservative opposition parties.
On the contrary, the splits are certain to reappear this week, as the Senate
embarks on a three-day debate on the revision of the French constitution, as
a preamble to the ratification of the Maastricht Treaty of European Union.
Monday's censure motion in the National Assembly, which denounced the
government for having agreed in Brussels to a far-reaching reform of the
Community's agricultural policy, provided an opportunity for the
conservatives to put on a united front, after their recent division and
disagreement in the first phase of the Maastricht debate.
What really put the government's position at risk was a last-minute decision
of the 25-strong Communist group to vote for the censure motion. In the
past, the Communists have refused to join forces with the conservatives,
except for one occasion in 1990.
Monday's vote is a clear warning that the socialists can no longer count on
them.
Monday's show of unity has only temporarily enhanced the conservative
parties' credibility. The leaders of the Gaullist party know that these
squabbles are deeply damaging to their image. At the end of the day, they
will be forced to endorse the Maastricht Treaty, because an anti-European
posture is not a viable option for a mainstream French political leader. And
yet they are apparently unable to lay down a firm party line or assert party
discipline.

THE Swiss cabinet has proposed delaying a Dollars 2.3bn order of 34

FT  03 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Midland battle intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO, COLIN MILLHAM and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE battle for control of Midland Bank grew fiercer as Hongkong &amp; Shanghai
Banking Corporation (HSBC) launched an increased and final offer valuing
Midland at Pounds 3.9bn, or around 470p a share. The timing surprised
dealers who responded by hoisting Midland 31 to 452p.
Exceptionally heavy trading, after the increased bid terms were announced,
triggered stories that another large corporate buyer had moved into the
market, but traders said the buying represented nothing more than big US
arbitrageurs manoeuvring for position as the battle moves into its final
stages. 'There was no evidence of any large blocks of Midland shares
changing hands,' said one dealer, as turnover reached 29m shares.
Mr Mike Fesemeyer, banks analyst at Nomura, said the move by Hongkong
Banking was 'extremely well timed' and had a 'good chance of succeeding'.
He pointed out that the closing date for the bid was July 7, and the outcome
of the investigation by the Monopolies Commission into the proposed bid by
Lloyds Bank would not be known until August 25. Mr Fesemeyer added, however,
that Lloyds may well signal its intention of making a much higher bid,
possibly in excess of 550p a share when its Board makes an expected
announcement on Friday. Glaxo reverse
The fortunes of Glaxo shares varied sharply yesterday as an early morning
rise, prompted by broker support, was reversed after worrying figures from
the US.
French stockbroker Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull had taken its cue from
a survey in the US financial press which listed Glaxo as the third most
popular stock in a table of those expected to perform best over the next 12
months. Strauss turned 'mildly positive' on Glaxo at its morning meeting
arguing that US investors were likely to return to the pharmaceutical
sector.
The shares jumped 21 but in the afternoon US group Bristol Myers Squibb came
out with a projection of single figure earnings per share growth for the
second quarter. The new projection resulted from reduced inventories by
wholesalers, particularly of cancer and heart drugs. Some felt that the
price discounting could spill over into the anti-ulcer drug market, thus
affecting Glaxo's Zantac, which is responsible for around 65 per cent of
profits. It would also affect SmithKline Beecham's Tagamet. Glaxo closed 4
1/2 off at 770 1/2 p with 5.3m shares traded. SmithKline eased a penny to
924p.
Cellular radio group Vodafone, badly mauled in recent sessions by reduced
valuations and worries about increased regulation by Oftel, rallied strongly
amid hints that the group is about to launch a new digital cellular radio
system, simultaneously in Germany, France and the UK.
The shares moved up strongly to touch 385p, before closing 9 higher at 383p,
on good turnover of 5.2m shares. Henderson Crosthwaite were said to have
been heavy buyers of Vodafone, as were UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, the company's
broker.
Disappointing figures from Allied Colloids prompted a slide in the shares.
Profits of Pounds 42.1m were up by Pounds 3.2m on last year but the market
had expected Pounds 44m and the shares were marked down by 20p. There was
some reconsideration after the company's meeting with analysts and the
shares recovered to close 8 off at 205p. Hoare Govett was, however,
unimpressed and shifted its stance from a hold to a sell, arguing that the
stock was rated too highly.
Clinical laboratory JS Pathology jumped 16 to 170p after Corning of the US
announced that its subsidiary CLSI was making an offer worth Pounds 23.1m,
or 175p per share, for all the Pathology stock.
Lloyds Bank fell 7 to 432p, awaiting the bank's response to HSBC's increased
offer for Midland. Specialists said that if Lloyds failed to win control of
Midland it was most unlikely that it would move against TSB or Royal Bank of
Scotland. An offer for Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, the highly regarded building
society, was one option that was put forward.
Nevertheless, speculators chased Royal Bank of Scotland, which closed 5
higher at 204p on turnover of 3.2m. TSB edged up 2 1/2 to 144 1/2 p, on
heavy turnover of 6.3m, after news that the bank is buying out the minority
49 per cent interest in TSB Channel Islands. The latter soared 93 to 246p on
the news.
Standard Chartered plummeted to 476p before stabilising to close 17 off at
481p in the wake of fears that the bank may have to increase provisions
against losses incurred by its Indian branches. Dealers said it was unlikely
that Standard would have to increase provisions of Pounds 50m already
announced.
Fears about the future of a European Fighter Aircraft project on which
British Aerospace is the lead contractor, weakened the shares, and they
ended 5 lower at 345p. A meeting for institutional investors is being
planned by the company's brokers next week.
An analyst's forecast cut accompanied by a gloomy outlook for the company
caused a retreat in IMI. The shares fell 6 to 290p after Smith New Court
reduced its 1993 profits forecast for IMI by Pounds 3.3m to Pounds 90.1m.
The current-year figure was left at Pounds 80m.
Caution by County NatWest on the industrial conglomerates sent several
leaders lower. These included BTR, which shed 3 to 478p, while Cookson Group
gave up 4 to 160p.
International drinks group Guinness improved 5 to 608p, supported by
conversion of loan stock and preference shares into ordinary shares, amid
suggestions that French cognac and luxury goods group LVMH must buy more
Guinness shares if its agreed 24 per cent cross stake is not to be diluted.
Unilever was 8 higher at 915p in active trading of 2.3m shares, as the
market reassessed some of the more defensive stocks neglected in the
euphoria following April's general election. Mr Carl Short, food
manufacturing analyst at Nomura, pointed out that Unilever has
underperformed the market by 10 per cent in the last three months and as a
quality stock is due to recover.
Albert Fisher, 3 1/2 lower at 73 1/2 p, suffered from speculation that
takeover opportunities may be limited in future, and was also hit by
suggestions of a profit downgrade from Kleinwort Benson.

FT  03 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Falls in drug stocks check advance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRANSATLANTIC pressures on the big pharmaceutical stocks, together with Wall
Street's failure to maintain its overnight momentum, yesterday undermined
early gains on the London stock market.
UK stocks opened strongly after Wall Street's overnight rise to a new peak,
and received a further boost when Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation
increased its offer for Midland, the UK clearing bank, to Pounds 3.9bn.
At mid-morning, the FT-SE Index was nearly 20 points up, although trading
levels were not much higher than in the previous session. There was little
support behind the early advance, however, and London was already drifting
off when Wall Street made a disappointing start to the new session,
reversing its early gain to show a fall of several Dow points in UK trading
hours.
By the close of business, the gain on London had been smartly trimmed for a
final reading on the FT-SE Index of 2,705.9, a gain on the day of 8.3
points, with traders sounding unconvinced by the recovery of the Footsie
2,700 mark.
The weaker showing of the second half of the session was a reflection of
Wall Street, where the implications of disappointing quarterly trading
figures from Bristol-Myers Squibb quickly reached London and helped reverse
early gains in Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham, both of which closed the day on
the downside.
The attention of the trading desks was focused on shares in Midland Bank,
after the new terms from Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Bank were interpreted in the
London market as a possible knockout blow. Dealers believe that it will be
difficult for Lloyds Bank to unveil a counter stroke at its meeting on
Friday, if only because of the timetable imposed by the UK Monopolies
Commission inquiry into its proposed offer for Midland. Shares in Lloyds
Bank eased yesterday as the stock market awaited news from the bank's
boardroom.
Midland shares were heavily traded in London, recording 29m of the day's
493.8m shares total, which compared with 425.3m on Monday. Traders believed
that yesterday's activity in Midland reflected arbitrage buying by brokers
building positions ahead of the expected close of the bid struggle rather
than speculators expecting fresh developments. The cash element of
Hongkong's new terms were regarded as the key factor.
Success for the Hongkong bid has positive implications for equities since
the new banking group would be quoted in London, almost inevitably as a
Footsie stock; institutions would take stakes in the new stock, and the
input of investment fund cash would help a market looking for signs of
encouragement.
While the mood of the stock market remained cautious, optimism was expressed
by fund managers attending a Global Investment Strategy Conference held in
London by Kleinwort Benson Securities, the UK merchant bank. The managers
predicted a rise of 12 per cent in the UK market over the next 12 months,
bringing the Footsie to around 3,035, although they expect a gain of only 2
per cent on Wall Street.

FT  03 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING in the derivative markets was boosted yesterday by Monday's firm
overnight performance on Wall Street, leading to improved turnover in both
FT-SE futures and traded options, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, the June contract on the FT-SE opened strongly at
2,716. Early attempts, particularly from independent traders, to push the
contract lower met with stiff resistance and June moved forward, boosted mid
session by the improved offer from HSBC, for Midland Bank.
However, the afternoon falls in the pharmaceutical sector, which led to a
retreat in the underlying cash market, spread into futures and June was
forced to relinquish some earlier gains.
Profit-taking during the afternoon session was also noticed, but on balance
June ended ahead at 2,717, up 8 on its previous close and around 5 points
above its estimated fair value premium to cash of about 6. Turnover was a
healthy 7,716 contracts.
Traded options activity improved from Monday's meagre level. Turnover at
33,521 lots was substantially better than Monday's 19,806 contracts. The
FT-SE 100 option traded a total of 6,175 lots. In stock options, Midland
Bank, was the most active, trading a total of 4,507 contracts.

FT  03 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Sharp drop in drug stocks
cools enthusiasm for Dow
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
A SHARP DECLINE in drug stocks dragged US stock markets lower yesterday as
the enthusiasm that had pushed the leading index to new highs on Monday
quickly petered out, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was down 17.11 at 3,396.10,
having spent the entire day in negative territory. The more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 also ended lower, down 3.80 at 413.50, as did the Amex
composite, 0.89 weaker at 393.95. The Nasdaq composite, however, added to
Monday's gains, rising another 0.81 to 589.18. Turnover on the NYSE was 203m
shares.
Although analysts hailed Monday's close above 3,400 on the Dow as an
important breakthrough, investors showed little inclination to take stocks
much higher.
Sentiment was not helped by a smaller-than-expected 1.3 per cent rise in
April single-family home sales, another indication that the recovery in the
housing market may have stalled.
Among individual stocks, Bristol Myers-Squibb plunged Dollars 7 1/4 to
Dollars 66 1/2 in turnover of 7.7m shares after the drug group announced
that it expected second quarter sales to be up less than 5 per cent from a
year ago, due primarily to low wholesalers' inventories.
The weakness in Bristol Myers spread throughout the drugs sector, with all
the leading stocks posting losses. Pfizer fell Dollars 3 1/4 to Dollars 71
1/2 , Merck gave up Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 49 5/8 , the ADRs of UK group
Glaxo slipped Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 27 1/4 , Schering-Plough fell Dollars
2 1/2 to Dollars 50 5/8 and Upjohn gave up Dollars 1 at Dollars 34 5/8 .
Unisys rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 9 7/8 in turnover of 1.6m shares after
the company said it was ahead of schedule in its plan to cut costs by
Dollars 800m annually by the end of this year.
Harley-Davidson dropped Dollars 2 7/8 to Dollars 55 7/8 after the company
told its dealers that motorcycle output has been slowed by a one-week
production backlog, which will not be made up in the June quarter.
General Electric fell Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 75 1/2 after the defence
department suspended future aircraft engine contracts with the company
because of allegations that GE committed fraud in jet engine contracts with
Israel.
On the Nasdaq market, Sun Microsystems fell Dollars 2 to Dollars 26 as
investors reacted to the news that the Baltimore-based broking house, Alex
Brown, had removed the stock from its 'emphasis list'.
Advanced Telecommunications rose Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 20 after the
company said that it was in talks regarding a possible merger with an
unnamed company.
Canada
TORONTO PRICES closed little changed in moderate trading. According to
preliminary figures, the TSE 300 composite index gained 6.22 points, or 0.18
per cent, to close at 3,410.20. Advancing issues outnumbered declines 277 to
256.
Volume was 25.8m shares, up from Monday's 22.8m, and trading value rose to
CDollars 327.5m from CDollars 303.3m.
Ten of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by transportation, up 2.3 per
cent. The day's biggest decline belonged to the industrial products group,
off 0.9 per cent. Financial services also closed lower.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Equity Issues: Siemens launches Dollars 1bn
offering with warrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIEMENS, the German electrical and electronics group, yesterday launched a
Dollars 1bn bond issue with warrants, one of the largest equity-related bond
issues in the Euromarkets.
The German group is one of three borrowers - the others are Japan Associated
Finance and Investor of Sweden - to issue equity-linked bonds this week,
leading to speculation that other companies may start to use these
instruments again in the near future.
Convertible bonds fell out of favour a few months ago after investors had
their fingers burned in some of the less accessible markets.
A number of South Korean, Indonesian and Taiwanese companies launched
convertible issues at a time when foreign investors had only limited access
to the underlying equity markets. However, investors were disappointed when
the underlying stock markets subsequently fell, which meant that there was
no point in taking up their conversion rights.
The Siemens 10-year bonds-with-warrants issue, which has an 8 per cent
coupon, was launched at a price of 132 yesterday and dropped back to
131.00-131.50 by late afternoon. The bond portion was priced to yield 50
basis points over the US Treasury bond, but the yield spread narrowed to 42
basis points during the day.
The warrants alone, which were priced at 173, fell to 164-166, while the
stripped bonds traded at par-30 to par-35. The warrants give investors the
right to buy Siemens shares at a 25 per cent premium over yesterday's market
price of DM688.50. There are 15 warrants per bond.
Continental European investors bought the bonds with warrants, but dealers
said German investors were keener to buy the warrants alone, while UK
institutions picked up the stripped bonds.
Siemens last launched a bond-with-warrants issue in 1986, but in that case
it was a zero-coupon bond, and the warrants are due to mature in mid-June.
The money is being raised for general purpose funding.
Japan Associated Finance, a venture capital group also known as Jafco,
announced a Dollars 200m convertible bond issue yesterday. 'For European
investors this kind of instrument provides a play on the (Japanese)
over-the-counter market,' said one syndicate official.
The convertible bond has a coupon of 4.5 per cent and the conversion price
will be fixed at either 2.5 per cent over the six-day average of the daily
low trade, or at the highest quotation on June 9, whichever is the higher of
the two.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries rally after surprise Fed coupon
purchase

US TREASURY prices staged a remarkable turnround yesterday after the Federal
Reserve surprisingly announced an outright purchase of coupons.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government issue was up  9/32 at 101
9/16 , yielding 7.857 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/8 at 99 27/32 ,
yielding 5.192 per cent.
Prices opened markedly weaker across the board and remained at low levels
throughout the morning after the likelihood of another interest rate cut had
dwindled in the wake of Monday's unexpectedly strong May purchasing
managers' report.
In the afternoon, however, prices rallied sharply after the Fed's
announcement. Few had expected a coupon pass from the Fed, so inventories
were low. Subsequently, the rush of buying by dealers who needed securities
to sell to the Fed pushed prices higher.
Earlier in the day there had been little reaction to the news of a
surprisingly small 1.3 per cent rise in April new single-family home sales,
but the buying lacked conviction and soon petered out.
UK government bond prices slipped back in dull trading with dealers
suggesting that the Danish referendum on the Maastricht Treaty exerted a
restraining influence on the market yesterday.
Short-dated gilts ended the day little changed, while longer-dated issues
edged lower. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 slipped from its
opening level of 117 31/32 to trade at 117 7/8 by late afternoon.
The Bank of England issued a Pounds 100m tranche of the existing 6 3/4 per
cent gilt due 1995/98, which will be available for sale from today at a
price of 93 1/16 .
Dealers pointed out that the existing stock had recently been trading
'rather expensively' in the market and welcomed the Bank's decision to issue
a new tranche for market management purposes.
In addition, a Pounds 500m tranche of 3 per cent Treasury stock due 1992
matures next week, so investors who prefer to hold low-coupon stocks may be
keen to place the proceeds from the maturing stock in another low-coupon
issue such as the 6 3/4 per cent 1995/98 gilt.
THE European government bond markets fell back yesterday as rumours
circulated that Denmark would vote against the ratification of the
Maastricht Treaty on economic and monetary union in yesterday's referendum.
Despite a clutch of recent opinion polls showing a swing in favour of
ratification, traders said speculation had circulated in the bond markets
and sent prices lower in Germany, France and the Ecu bond market. The fall
in the US Treasury bond market also helped ond prices.
Traders noted some switching out of Germany into the Scandinavian markets
ahead of the referendum result.
The Danish government bond market ended the day higher, with the 9 per cent
bond due 2000 moving from its opening level of 101.70 to close at 101.95.
JAPANESE government bond prices ended at the day's lows as the yen failed to
strengthen against the US dollar.
The market opened on a weak note yesterday, following the fall in US
Treasury bond prices overnight and the halt in the yen's strengthening
against the US currency. The Bank of Japan intervened in the foreign
exchange markets, selling dollars for the fifth consecutive trading day, and
the yen traded at 127.50 to the dollar in London, compared with 127.15 the
previous day.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 JGB opened at 5.535 per cent and moved in
a range of 5.5 to 5.535 per cent before closing in Tokyo at 5.53 per cent.
China plans to put Y21bn of state treasury bonds on the market on July 1 as
part of efforts to tap growing personal savings, AP-DJ reports from Beijing.
The Ministry of Finance said the bonds would mature on July 1 1995. Annual
interest on the tax-exempt bonds will be 9.5 per cent. It did not give
details of how money raised would be spent.

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GENGOLD, the gold arm of the Gencor group, is to cease underground
operations at its West Rand Consolidated gold mine, in a move which will
cost 1,100 workers their jobs.
The announcement provides further evidence of the straitened circumstances
of the local gold industry. For years profitability has been squeezed by
escalating costs, while revenues have remained flat due to a weak gold price
and firm rand/dollar exchange rate.
Last year, Gengold announced the closure ofthe Stilfontein mine.
A number of other marginal mines in the industry are threatened. The largest
of these is Harmony, where up to 8,000 workers are threatened with
retrenchment. The National Union of Mineworkers and Rand Mines, which
manages Harmony, plan to ask the government next week for state aid for the
mine.
At current gold prices, about 12 per cent of South Africa's 600 tonnes per
annum gold production is unprofitable. Approximately 15 per cent of the
400,000 miners in the industry work on these mines.
Mr Gary Maude, managing director of Gengold, said everything possible had
been done to keep the mine profitable. He said half the mine's skilled
employees had been offered employment at other operations. During the life
of the mine, to the end of 1991, it produced 614 tonnes of gold. Total
pre-tax income was R202m (Dollars 71.4m), of which R65m was paid in taxes
and R71m in dividends.
Mr Maude said if the gold price recovered to make some of the reserves
payable again, mining could be restarted.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Hollinger suffers loss of
CDollars 32m in first quarter

<TEXT>
HOLLINGER, the Canadian listed holding company controlled by Mr Conrad
Black, proprietor of the UK's Daily Telegraph newspaper, suffered a
first-quarter loss as a result of a write-down in the value of its
recently-sold investment in Britain's United Newspapers.
Hollinger sold its 9 per cent stake in United Newspapers in April for
substantially less than it paid when it started accumulating the shares in
early 1989.
The first-quarter loss was CDollars 31.7m (USDollars 26.4), or 63 cents a
share, against earnings of CDollars 17.4m, or 24 cents, a year earlier.
Operating earnings fell to CDollars 6.6m from CDollars 11.3m, due to an
CDollars 8.1m jump in tax provisions, while revenues rose 9 per cent to
CDollars 209m.
Hollinger said the higher tax provision was due to tax loss carry-forwards
at the Telegraph in the first half of 1991. Tax rates are likely to be more
similar in the second half.
Losses from the United sale are likely to be more than offset by gains from
the forthcoming public offering of 20m shares in the Telegraph group. The
Telegraph issue is expected to raise about Pounds 75m.
Hollinger has also recently raised CDollars 135m through the sale of four
series of preferred shares in Canada as part of its efforts to reduce debt.
Mr Christopher Ondaatje, the Canadian financier, is bidding to buy back full
control of the Toronto investment firm that bears his name, writes Robert
Gibbens in Montreal.
Mr Ondaatje was a co-founder of Loewen Ondaatje McCutcheon in 1970, and he
is offering CDollars 1.80 a share for all the firm's stock. He sold his
original stake late in 1987 at CDollars 9 a share. His bid competes with an
offer from two Vancouver businessmen who would buy 28 per cent of the LOM
shares from five management shareholders at Dollars 1.64 a share.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: GE shares dip on fraud
allegation

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in General Electric dipped yesterday after it announced the US
Defence Department had suspended future aircraft engine contracts with the
company because of allegations that it committed fraud in the sale of
military jet engines to Israel.
A GE spokesman said the company would appeal against the decision, which it
felt lacked both 'fair process and merit.'
On the New York Stock Exchange, the company's shares stood at Dollars 75 1/2
, down Dollars  7/8 , at close of trading.
The Pentagon's action follows a so-called 'whistleblower' suit by a former
GE employee alleging that a group of employees in the company's aero engine
division conspired with an Israeli general and fraudulently diverted money
into his personal accounts to influence Israeli jet engine purchases.
GE fired a top official allegedly involved in the scheme a year ago.
The company said yesterday that since learning of the allegations in
December 1990 it had co-operated fully with the Justice Department. It felt
the ban was a case of 'turning these efforts against us.'
The spokesman said the ban did not affect existing contracts. It was not
clear how long it might last.
GE is a major supplier of jet engines to the US military, and analysts said
a relatively brief ban was unlikely to affect its sales.
The 'whistleblower' suit - in which an employee blows the whistle on his
colleagues - is one of several which have embarrassed GE in recent years.
In April, another former GE official, who had been dismissed by the company,
filed a suit alleging it was conspiring with de Beers, the South African
group, to fix the price of industrial diamonds.
Mr Jack Welch, the chairman of GE, has dismissed these claims as 'pure
nonsense.'

<TEXT>
PERUSAHAAN Otomobil Nasional (Proton), Malaysia's national carmaker, hoisted
after-tax profits by 39 per cent to MDollars 259.38m (USDollars 103.75m) for
the year to March 31 from MDollars 187.02m a year earlier, agencies report.
The company said it expected an increase in after-tax profit for the current
year.
Pre-tax profit jumped 56 per cent to MDollars 407.88m from MDollars 261.47m,
while turnover advanced 23 per cent to MDollars 2.19bn from MDollars 1.79bn,
following plant improvement and support from its local and overseas dealers.
Proton, which was listed last March, plans to produce 107,000 units this
year, up from 102,000 in 1991.
The pre-tax profit exceeded the MDollars 406.6m forecast in its share offer
prospectus.
Much of the surge in pre-tax profit resulted from the company's relief from
deferred foreign-exchange losses, which had been fully amortised in the last
financial year. In that year, Proton spent MDollars 130m to pay off the
exchange losses.
An improvement in the output of its car plant and strong demand from its
distributors also helped boost profit, Proton said.
Proton, which is 17 per cent owned by companies in Japan's Mitsubishi group,
builds variants of a passenger car model based on the Mitsubishi Lancer.

company, in April agreed to pay Dollars 300m for the missile unit of US
defence and steel company LTV.
'It is what we fear more,' said Mr Jean-Paul Perrier, the head of
Thomson-CSF's missile division. 'We don't have so many concerns about the
security issue.'
According to analysts, the deal would be the largest foreign acquisition of
a US defence company. It has raised hackles in Congress, where legislation
has been introduced to block it.
LTV was the 17th-largest US defence contractor for the US fiscal year ended
September 30 1991. Thomson-CSF, 58 per cent-owned by the French state, is
negotiating with the US Defence Department (DOD) to meet its concerns that
the deal might compromise US national security.
At the same time, Thomson-CSF is answering detailed queries from the US
government's committee on foreign investment in the United States (CFIUS)
about the proposed deal.
Under the Exon-Florio amendment to the 1988 US Omnibus Trade Act, the
committee screens mergers affecting US national security, recommending to
the president whether to approve them.
'We think we will reach a solution acceptable to the US and in line with
Thomson-CSF's basic business objectives of obtaining a fair return on its
investment,' Mr Perrier said.
In late April, the US deputy secretary of defence, Mr Donald Atwood, said
such an acquisition would be approved only if the foreign buyer had 'passive
ownership'. What this means is still being discussed.
US officials said Thomson-CSF's chairman, Mr Alain Gomez, met Mr Atwood at
the weekend to discuss LTV.
Thomson-CSF officials said the French company was working to address the
DOD's security concerns and had put forward new measures to satisfy it.
Analysts have said Thomson-CSF might be obliged to manage LTV through an
intermediary board, denying the company access to classified technology and
denying it operational control.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: NZ Telecom advances 21%

<TEXT>
TELECOM Corporation of New Zealand yesterday unveiled a 21 per cent rise in
net profit to NZDollars 402.3m (USDollars 216.1m) for the year to March 31,
slightly above the target of NZDollars 401m set during last year's
international share float.
Mr Peter Shirtcliffe, chairman, said the result was achieved despite
sluggish economic conditions and increasing competition. He forecast the
company would post another record year in the coming year. Telecom lifted
revenue 5.6 per cent to NZDollars 2.57bn, with the biggest growth coming
from the sale of directories and the provision of cellular and other new
services. Combined revenue from these operations jumped 26 per cent to
NZDollars 671m, boosted by new 'smart phone' and free national dialling 0800
numbers.
Competition from rival Clear Communications held growth in revenue from
national calls to 1.1 per cent, or to NZDollars 548.6m. The company handled
10 per cent more national calls during the year.
Telecom's revenue on local services fell 11.5 per cent to NZDollars 840.7m.
It maintains it must subsidise these services as increases in charges are
limited by the 'Kiwi share' agreement with the government.
Mr Tom Burns, acting chief executive, said the company was 'sitting on a
gold mine' of cost reductions based on new technology introduction.
He said Telecom would cut a further 1,200 jobs in the 1992-93 year, after a
9 per cent drop from 13,562 in the past year.
Telecom's operating expenses rose by 22.6 per cent to NZDollars 1844m.
Maintenance costs dropped seven per cent, while depreciation was up nine per
cent. Telecom ended the year with a cash surplus of NZDollars 76m after two
years of deficits. It is to pay a final dividend of 6.5 cents a share,
making a total 13 cents for the year.

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Basic issues that remain unsettled - Norma
Cohen on the latest round in the takeover war for the UK's smallest clearer
/ The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An institutional shareholder in Midland Bank, summing up the latest round in
the bidding war for the UK's smallest clearing bank, said: 'It doesn't seem
to be a knock-out blow by any means. We're waiting to see what Lloyds is
going to say.'
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank yesterday increased its offer to the equivalent
of 480p per share from 410p, and promised shareholders that they could
receive cash for the portion of their holdings that had previously only been
exchangeable into 10-year subordinated bonds.
So far, Lloyds Bank has said only that it believes the deal does not
represent a significant increase in value from the original offer and that
its own board will be meeting on Friday to discuss the matter.
Shareholders yesterday referred to market speculation that Lloyds will write
to Midland shareholders offering the equivalent of 500p per share,
conditional upon the Monopolies and Mergers Commission clearing the bid on
competition grounds.
The introduction of a cash element by HSBC was one of the key sweeteners
that shareholders had previously specified they would have to see before
becoming convinced that the deal was attractive.
HSBC has also dramatically increased the yield on the subordinated debt to
2.4 percentage points above a comparable maturity government gilt - a yield
close to that offered on speculative-quality bonds. Indeed, many said that
while they continue to have reservations about the offer themselves, they
viewed the introduction of a cash element as too tempting for most other
shareholders.
'Many will simply take the money and run,' said one fund manager, adding
that Lloyds will have to increase its offer enough to sufficiently outweigh
the risk that the MMC will forbid it from proceed-ing.
Significantly, HSBC has said its offer is final and will not be improved.
Shareholders have until June 25 to decide and the MMC report is not due out
until August. Therefore, shareholders who do not tender their shares will be
gambling either that the deal will get a green light from the MMC or that
HSBC is bluffing.
'Hongkong Bank will never get another bite of the cherry like this,' said
one shareholder, expressing the view that Midland offers it the one
opportunity it will have to break into the UK market on a significant scale.
Most believe that HSBC badly needs to shift its reliance on the Hong Kong
market precisely because of its own concerns about the future post-1997.
Thus, it needs Midland even more than Lloyds does. Should Lloyds be denied
the chance to bid, HSBC is likely to come back with yet another offer, they
said.
Meanwhile, institutional shareholders said yesterday that while the offer
went a long way towards satisfying their basic complaint that the HSBC offer
undervalued Midland, it left many other basic issues unsettled.
In short, institutions have two nagging concerns about the HSBC offer that
go beyond the arithmetic of the deal.
First, there is considerable uncertainty among UK institutions about
long-term prospects in Hong Kong after 1997, and there is concern about the
focus of HSBC's other international operations.
'Frankly, we'd much rather be shareholders in Lloyds Bank,' said one
institutional shareholder with a significant stake in Midland.
'The offer is quite rich and quite tempting but Lloyds is a natural holding
for us and a more logical fit for us than a vague global bank.'
The efforts of Lloyds' own management over the past few years to pare costs
and hone operations has left institutions vastly impressed with its
management style.
Indeed, they take great comfort from the view that Lloyds' chairman, Sir
Jeremy Morse, is likely to slash branches and dispose of operations if
Midland came under his control. Its management has been the most respected
of the four UK clearers.
But shareholders are also concerned about the HSBC bid because they largely
share the view that the UK market is over-banked to begin with.
The entrance of yet another leading institution with fresh capital is going
to do little to improve the profitability of the industry as a whole, they
say.
However, even those shareholders inclined towards Lloyds concede there are
risks in waiting for an offer to materialise and receive the blessing of the
MMC.
Without any bid on the table, Midland shares could well drift back towards
300p, they said. And even those uneasy with holding the shares of an
enlarged HSBC are taking comfort from the thought that the shares will be
included in the FT-A All-Share Index and the FT-SE 100 Index by next year.
The combined capital of HSBC and Midland will make it one of the largest
companies in those indices, greatly increasing the liquidity of the shares
and hence, their value.
Overall, shareholders do not expect the MMC to reject the Lloyds offer on
competition grounds.
'They will say there are a few problems in a few areas and some things will
have to be sold,' one shareholder said, explaining why he thought waiting
for Lloyds is worth the risk.

value per share of 289.4p at its March 31 year end. This compared with
276.8p at September 30 and with 255.6p a year earlier.

Mr Michael Denny, chairman of Northern Venture Managers which manages the

been satisfactory.
However, he did not foresee much improvement in the economy generally over
the coming months. The emphasis would remain on seeking out sensibly-valued

Atkins Group, the Leicester-shire-based textile manufacturer, returned to
profits in the second half resulting in a pre-tax figure of Pounds 157,000
for the year to March 31, against Pounds 243,000 last time.
Second half profits increased from Pounds 51,000 to Pounds 205,000.
However, there were extraordinary charges of Pounds 242,000 (Pounds
302,000), relating to provisions on a property sale and an aborted
acquisition, resulting in a retained loss of Pounds 368,000 (Pounds 416,000)
after paying the dividend.
The shares fell 4p to 116p.
Mr David Haggett, chairman, said: 'Our latest figures start to demonstrate
the benefits of the actions taken over the past year.' He added that the
present half would reflect the seasonality of the business but garment and
hosiery prospects were healthier.
Gearing had been cut over the year from 38 per cent to 34 per cent. The
intention to sell property had been affected by the depressed market but Mr
Haggett said there had been increased interest. The value of the properties
had been reduced by Pounds 225,000.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 16.9m (Pounds 16.5m).
Earnings per share came out at 3.81p (5.25p). A final dividend of 4p makes a
total for the year of 7.6p (9.6p).

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Warburg chairman's salary leaps
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR DAVID Scholey, chairman of SG Warburg, the City merchant bank, received
a 134 per cent salary increase in the year to March 1992, according to
Warburg's annual report.
The increase is bound to raise eyebrows in the City as it comes at a time
when Sir David is being widely tipped to succeed Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton as
the next Governor of the Bank of England.
Most of the increase came from a Pounds 687,000 payment from a long-term
performance-related pay scheme, linked to the Warburg share price. The
scheme is operated by a committee of non-executive directors.
If Sir David does move to the Bank of England he will take a sharp cut in
salary. Last month it was disclosed that Mr Leigh-Pemberton received a 28
per cent rise to Pounds 198,446 in 1991-92, but decided to waive all but 6
per cent of the increase.
A 17 per cent pay increase to Pounds 155,019 for the Governor in 1990
aroused controversy.
Warburg's annual report shows that three other directors waived emoluments
of Pounds 134,000.

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Campaigns that will be pressed to a
successful conclusion - The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MEN at the top of the three banks involved in the takeover battle for
Midland Bank yesterday all expressed determination to press their campaigns
to a successful conclusion.
Mr Brian Pitman, chief executive of Lloyds, left the International Monetary
Conference annual meeting in Toronto early last night in order to fly home
to plan his bank's response to the improved offer from Hongkong and
Shanghai.
He said he had not been surprised by Hongkong Bank's move, having watched
'what was going on in the stock market'.
Mr Pitman would not rule out his bank launching a raid in the stock market
on Midland's shares, to persuade Midland's shareholders of its confidence in
the battle.
'We would have to get the permission of the Secretary of State (for Trade
and Industry),' he said.
Mr Pitman said Lloyds would decide how to respond to Hongkong Bank's move
when its board meets later this week.
He said he wanted to see how Midland's shareholders reacted to the Hongkong
Bank move. Mr Pitman also pointed out that the value of the terms Lloyds was
currently proposing was not much below Hongkong Bank's new bid terms.
He said: 'We will have to tell Midland's shareholders what our offer is
worth now and what it could be worth later'. He said he remained convinced
that 'people see the commercial logic of what we are doing'.
Lloyds proposal to buy Midland is being investigated for the next three
months by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
However, Midland's shareholders have to make up their minds whether to
accept Hongkong Bank's terms by June 25, long before the MMC investigation
is finished.
Mr William Purves, chairman of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation,
who is also in Toronto and is this year's IMC president, said that despite
being on the opposite sides of a takeover campaign, 'no words other than
friendly words' had passed between himself and Mr Pitman. 'We have known
each other a long time,' he said.
Mr Purves said his bank's new bid terms were 'definitely the final offer'.
He had decided to improve the offer now, much earlier than he had needed to
under the Takeover Code, because it was 'time to get uncertainty away from
the thing'.
His bank is holding an extraordinary meeting of its shareholders on June 9
and Mr Purves thought it was 'better if shareholders know what we are doing'
before the meeting. He had decided to provide cash as part of the offer
because 'we listen to what the institutions are saying. The institutions
were not happy with the loan stock'.
Nonetheless, he thought some institutions would choose to keep the loan
stock, rather than opting for the cash alternative, since the coupon on the
loan stock had been raised.
Mr Purves felt able to raise the offer because the 'perception of the value
of Midland' had improved. He said there were signs that loan loss provisions
of UK banks in general were falling.
Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive of Midland, warned shareholders that they
would have to realise by June 25 that if they rejected the board's
recommendation the directors 'would have to think very long and hard before
they invited the Hongkong Bank to come back for a second bid.'

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Bonds that carry far more generous terms -
The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BONDS offered to Midland shareholders under the revised offer from
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation carry far more generous terms than
under the initial offer.
If the bid is approved, the subordinated bonds will be priced to yield 2.4
per cent more than UK government paper of the same maturity, compared with a
spread of 1.6 per cent under the initial offer.
The bonds have also been underwritten. Midland shareholders could sell bonds
back to underwriters at this agreed level - the first time the Eurobond
market has been used as a source of bid funding in this way.
The issue will also be smaller than under the original offer. The maximum
size of the issue is now Pounds 454m, reduced from Pounds 700m.
Bankers said yesterday that the smaller size of the bond issue did not
reflect a shortage of firms willing to underwrite paper on the new terms.
'At this level the underwriters will not have to work very hard for their
fees,' commented a new issue manager at a leading sterling firm not involved
in the transaction.
Subordinated bonds issued by other banks trade at much lower yields in the
secondary market. For example, 10-year subordinated bonds issued by Standard
Chartered were yesterday trading on a yield spread of about 1.75 per cent
over gilts.
However, direct comparison with bonds issued by other banks is difficult:
the paper would be issued by HSBC, the holding company for Hongkong Bank and
Midland Bank, rather than an operating subsidiary.
Since the main assets of the holding company are the shares of the operating
banks, holders of subordinated bonds issued by HSBC would rank below all the
creditors of both Hongkong Bank and Midland.
Bankers said yesterday that this degree of subordination could be worth an
additional 0.3 per cent in yield.
the wide yield spread also reflects the need to offer underwriters a buffer
against some potentially large risks.
The firms have agreed to underwrite the paper at a fixed yield spread for an
indeterminate period - possibly until August if the bid is delayed. This
exposes them to the risk that yield spreads in the market as a whole will
widen, leaving them owning bonds priced out of line with the market.
Moreover, the underwriting agreement does not protect underwriters against
either 'force majeure' or 'material adverse change' in the condition of HSBC
during the underwriting period.
The cost of underwriting a conventional 10-year subordinated bond issue in
the Eurobond market is usually between 0.4 and 0.5 per cent of the amount
raised - anything up to Pounds 2.25m for a deal of this size.
HSBC is likely to be paying at least this amount in terms of both fees and
the wide yield spread at which the bonds are underwritten.
The underwriting syndicate assembled by HSBC contained no surprises:
Schroder's and Cazenove are not known for underwriting capacity in the bond
market but have relationships with HSBC and Midland.
Warburg is both an adviser to HSBC and a leading sterling bond firm.
Credit Suisse First Boston is one of the few main forces in the sterling
market not allied to Lloyds, such as Baring Brothers, or owned by another UK
clearing bank. A small number of other firms may be added to the
underwriting syndicate today.
At Pounds 454m the issue would not be the largest sterling bond issue made
by a company. In April, Hanson launched a Pounds 500m Eurosterling bond
issue lead managed by CSFB.
However, earlier subordinated bond issues by banks have been far smaller in
size - up to Pounds 150m. It is clear that the underwriters were only
comfortable backing a Pounds 450m issue if the paper was priced to sell.

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Colony perceives increased offer as an
astute move - The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG AND Shanghai Bank's increased offer for Midland Bank was last night
seen in Hong Kong as an astute move which will cost the suitor little and
probably assure it possession of the UK clearer.
Analysts believe that the injection of 65p cash a share will be enough to
overcome UK investors' reservations about accepting Hongkong Bank debt - a
key feature of its original offer.
Mr John Grey, the bank's deputy chairman, acknowledged the importance of
this yesterday when he admitted to UK investors dissatisfaction with the
absence of cash in the initial bid.
The higher offer, valuing Midland at 476p a share on Hongkong Bank's closing
price of HKDollars 48.5 in the colony yesterday, together with the
regulatory hurdles which Lloyds still has to jump, makes it difficult for UK
investors to turn it down, analysts said.
'It is the sort of offer which means Midland shareholders are not giving it
away,' said Mr Archie Hart, research director at Crosby Securi-ties.
Hong Kong investors have not been thrilled by the prospect of the colony's
biggest bank buying into Europe. Many have already defected, preferring to
put their money into a 'pure' Hong Kong bank, such as Hang Seng Bank.
Hongkong Bank's share price has underperformed its domestic market, while
the latter has risen 20 per cent since mid-March, when Hongkong was in
discussions with Midland.
Hongkong Bank's share price has increased by about 8 per cent in the period,
and most of that was in the past couple of weeks.
'This market has tended to prefer news that this bid would not happen,' said
Mr John Mulcahy, research director of Peregrine Brokerage. 'But that has
also been a short-term reaction; with the removal of uncertainty I expect
the bank's share price to improve.'
Hong Kong analysts are, however, warming to the bid. They see the rationale
for the bank - an essentially British institution - moving back to the UK
ahead of the 1997 transfer of Hong Kong's sovereignty to China. Hongkong
Bank is also buying a UK clearer, which it knows well is at the bottom of
its earnings cycle.
Although the higher offer gives Midland a 25 per cent higher value than
Hongkong Bank's original bid, the 23.5 per cent rise in the bank's share
price since it announced the terms of its first offer for Midland on April
14 is responsible for most of the uplift in the value of the bid.
In reality, Hongkong Bank's bid is only 5 per cent better than its old
offer, if investors had taken equity rather than debt. That offer yesterday
would have valued each Midland share at 448p, while the new offer values the
UK clearer at 476p a share.
Few in Hong Kong expect the mainland Chinese press to endorse the higher
offer, but they do not see the Chinese government attempting to frustrate it
either. The bank has kept the Chinese authorities informed of its plans and
while they may not like all aspects of the Midland deal the Chinese are,
above all else, pragmatic people.

mainland Europe through acquisitions.
The group's advisers believe the retail element could be as high as 50 per
cent which would increase competition among institutional investors wanting
to buy the stock. There is also likely to be a significant placing of shares
on the Continent.
The sale will make multi millionaires of the company's four executive
directors, who together bought 5 per cent of its shares in the Dollars 375m
management buy-out in May 1990.
While other big buy-outs of the last few years have struggled to hit their
financial targets, DMFI's profits have risen rapidly.
Profits before tax increased by 82 per cent to Pounds 24.7m for the year to
November 29 1991, reflecting unit volume increases in all markets and
product categories.
Operating profit from trading activities before interest increased by 19 per
cent to Pounds 36.7m.
DMFI is completely separate from the Del Monte fresh fruit business, which
was bought by Polly Peck, the fruit and electronics conglomerate that
collapsed in 1990.
When Nabisco was bought by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US buy-out
specialists, in February 1989, Del Monte was sold and broken up.
DMFI has exclusive rights to use the Del Monte name for processed foods in
most parts of the world except the US. Its biggest market is Italy, where
its annual sales are Pounds 78.2m, followed by the UK, where the turnover is
Pounds 71m.
The business is being floated by Charterhouse, the merchant bank whose
investment funds own 60 per cent of DMFI, and Cazenove, the stockbroker. The
group expects some of its institutional investors to sell although it is not
clear what proportion will want to realise their holdings. The four senior
executives plan to hold on to most of their stock.
DMFI has expanded throughout Europe and developed a worldwide business which
operates in 35 countries.
The brand strength is sustained by unusually high expenditure on television
advertising and marketing. Marketing costs were Pounds 9m in 1989, the year
before the buy-out, and have risen to Pounds 24m this year.
As a result, DMFI is the number one or two leading canned fruit and beverage
brand in 12 European countries.

FT  03 JUN 92 / BHP ends doubt on Foster's future

<TEXT>
BROKEN Hill Proprietary (BHP), Australia's largest company, yesterday ended
more than two years of uncertainty over the future of Foster's Brewing Group
by appointing receivers to Mr John Elliott's International Brewing
Investments (IBI).
BHP's unexpected action removes control of a 32 per cent shareholding in
Foster's from IBI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of International Brewing
Holdings (IBH), a privately-owned company controlled by Mr Elliott and other
Foster's executives.
Mr Elliott, the former chairman and chief executive of Foster's, was abroad,
but is believed to have been informed of BHP's move. There was no comment
from other directors of IBH.
Mr John Prescott, BHP chief executive, said the group installed receivers to
protect its ADollars 1bn (Pounds 400m) preference share investment in IBI,
which is secured against the company's shareholding in Foster's.
Foster's shares fell 12 cents to ADollars 1.87 on the Australian Stock
Exchange after the move was announced, but closed one cent higher at
ADollars 2 after BHP said it would take steps to stabilise the brewing
group.
Mr Prescott said there would be no 'fire sale' of IBI's Foster's shares.
'If necessary, BHP will acquire the shares from the receivers to ensure that
they are not dispersed at less than full value,' he said.
BHP also said it had offered to purchase IBI's debt of about ADollars 1.2bn
to a syndicate of banks.
Such a purchase would prevent the appointment of separate receivers by the
syndicate, which also has a claim on IBI's Foster's shareholding as security
against its loans. Mr Prescott said BHP would look sympathetically at a
recent proposal by SA Brewing, the South Australian food and industrial
group, to merge with Foster's.
BHP's decision to appoint receivers follows the end of a moratorium on
interest payments on about ADollars 2.6bn of debt acquired by IBH to finance
the purchase of its shareholding in Foster's. Mr Prescott said the financial
instability of IBH had depressed the value of Foster's and caused board
disharmony, management distraction, financial pressures and a perceived
overhang of Foster's shares in the market.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Bristol-Myers forecast depresses drug shares

SHARES in Bristol-Myers Squibb, the world's third largest pharmaceuticals
company, plunged by about 10 per cent yesterday, after the US group warned
of only a 'mid-single digit' earnings advance in the second quarter and of
sales growth totalling less than 5 per cent.
The company blamed inventory reduction by wholesalers. However, analysts
said Bristol-Myers had also been affected by increasingly high levels of
discounting imposed by managed healthcare groups. These groups, often
containing insurance companies, have been insisting on lower prices for
drugs.
The warning hit other drugs company stocks on both sides of the Atlantic. By
the close in New York, Schering-Plough was down Dollars 2 1/2 at Dollars 50
3/8 , Merck fell Dollars 1 3/4 at Dollars 49 5/8 , Pfizer was Dollars 3 1/4
lower at Dollars 71 1/2 , and Upjohn lost 1 at Dollars 34 5/8 .
Bristol-Myers itself shed Dollars 7 1/4 at Dollars 66 1/2 .
In London, Glaxo fell from a high yesterday of 796p before closing at 770
1/2 p, down 5p on the day. SmithKline Beecham fell from a high of 941p to
924p, and Wellcome fell from a high of 981p to 971p, both down 1p on the
day.
Pharmaceuticals companies have been warning for some time about increased
discounting in the US. One UK-based group complained Wall Street analysts
were only just recognising the extent of the present pricing environment. In
addition to discounts to managed groups, companies have been forced to offer
rebates to Medicaid. Last year SmithKline Beecham paid back Dollars 50m
(Pounds 28m), while Glaxo paid Dollars 55m during the first half of this
year. In a formal statement released before the stock market opened, Mr
Michael Autera, Bristol-Myer's chief financial officer, said that
wholesalers' stocks of the company's pharmaceutical products were 'being
reduced to lower levels than previously anticipated - in some instances
below historical norms'.
Bristol-Myers' first-quarter revenue growth - only 2 per cent - had already
disappointed analysts. When the results were released, this was blamed on
heavy 'pre-buying' of drug products last autumn, ahead of anticipated
prescription drug price increases. Wall Street pundits had, however,
expected sales growth to pick up in the second quarter.
Yesterday, Mr Autera said that Bristol-Myers Squibb believed that the
'correction' in wholesalers' stocks had now run its course. But he warned
that the company could not be sure how low stocks would be taken, or when
sales would again reflect 'underlying levels of prescribing and use of its
pharmaceutical products'.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Standard Chartered may lose Rs11bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS and RC MURTHY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Chartered, the UK-based international bank, has an exposure of up
to Rs10.55bn (Pounds 200m) in India's biggest securities scandal, according
to a report published yesterday by the Reserve Bank, the country's central
bank.
Standard Chartered's shares dropped on news of the report, closing at 481p,
down 17p. After the market closed, the bank issued a statement to the London
Stock Exchange, saying that it still believed a Pounds 50m provision,
already announced, was 'the best prudent assessment of the provisioning
required'.
Mr Malcolm Williamson, chief executive, said he had not seen the Reserve
Bank report, but that it sounded as if it had focused on gross exposure,
rather than net. Standard Chartered had 'hard, tangible security, which we
don't believe is challengeable,' he said.
Banks' possible losses from the scandal, put by the central bank at
Rs30.8bn, stem from abuses of the interbank market. The Reserve Bank said
that there had been 'massive collusion' between banks and brokers in the
interbank market, adding: 'There has been a systematic diversion of funds
from the banking system to the individual accounts of certain brokers.'
The problems stemmed from bank's practice of issuing receipts to each other
to guarantee delivery of securities. These receipts have become widely
traded between banks, even though they are often not backed by underlying
securities
According to the report, Standard Chartered has paid out Rs3bn without
having received any bankers' receipts or other securities to back the
payments.
It is also holding receipts from banks with a face value of Rs7.55bn 'for
which the issuing banks do not appear to have sufficient backing'.
Some Rs5.3bn of these related to the Metropolitan Co-operative Bank,
described in the Reserve Bank report as 'a very small sized urban co-op
bank' with less than Rs100m of assets.
The remaining Rs2.25bn of receipts were issued by the Bank of Karad, a small
private bank that has gone into liquidation. Its receipts 'have either no
backing or backing of doubtful quality,' the central bank said.
Mr Williamson said Standard Chartered was close to finishing its work of
assessing the bank's security in Bombay. 'We've got about 15 trunkloads of
hard security - it's not bankers receipts or IOUs.' He added: 'We know we've
got some soft spots. We do have some outstandings to Bank Karad and
Metropolitan Co-operative bank - I don't think that's any secret.'

FT  03 JUN 92 / Diamond's hard-won reputation faces tough challenge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIAMOND may no longer be the hardest substance in the world now that US
researchers have made small quantities of carbon nitride, a synthetic
material which appears from preliminary tests to be as hard as or even
harder than diamond.
If the discovery at North-western University in Illinois is confirmed, it
will shatter diamond's romantic reputation for supreme hardness, which most
scientists had assumed would last for ever. But it could lead to many
industrial applications for carbon nitride (CN) as an ultrahard coating
which could resist wear better than any other material.
The Northwestern project started after physicists at the University of
California, Berkeley, published a computer prediction saying the hexagonal
crystal structure of CN - containing carbon and nitrogen atoms in a
three-to-four ratio - would be harder than the cubic crystals of diamond,
which is pure carbon.
The researchers have made a thin film of carbon nitride by a technique known
as reactive sputtering. This involves firing carbon atoms from a graphite
electrode at a smooth metal surface in a low-pressure atmosphere of
nitrogen.
Although there is not yet enough crystalline material to do a definitive
hardness test, preliminary results suggest that CN will live up to its
computer model. The coating has come through standard wear-resistance tests
without a scratch.
The university recently received a three-year grant from the US National
Science Foundation to make more carbon nitride and investigate its
applications. It could give a protective surface to a variety of materials
including cutting tools and bearings.
Mr Ming-Show Wong of North-western's industrial research laboratory sees a
large potential market in extending the life of computer disks with an
ultrahard coating.
But if carbon nitride is to become more than a scientific curiosity some
questions remain. For example, whether it can be manufactured at a
reasonable cost and how well it bonds to other materials.
A serious difficulty with diamond coatings is getting them to stick securely
to the substrate, says Mr Alan Collins, a physicist at King's College,
London. 'If carbon nitride sticks well to a large number of substrates, it
could be a winner.'
However, carbon nitride still exists only as a microscopic coating and as
yet there is no practical technique for making gem-sized crystals. So for
the foreseeable future diamonds remain a girl's best friend.

FT  03 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: De La Rue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
De La Rue shares have outpaced the market by 140 per cent over the past two
years, a performance which owes more to growing faith in the management than
to any fundamental shift in the outlook for its businesses. The question
after yesterday's 29 per cent rise in full year profits is whether other
stocks with a greater UK bias and better recovery potential will make more
attractive investments over the next 12 months.
It is true that the prospects for security printing are scarcely
commensurate with the number of column inches devoted to the fledgling
Estonian currency. Eastern Europe offers one of those once-in-a-generation
opportunities to boost the bank note order book: but it remains a relatively
unexciting if cash generative activity with average volume growth of 4 per
cent a year.
Complementing that steady annuity income, though, is the more interesting
payment systems side recently strengthened by the Swedish acquisition, Inter
Innovation. The process of integration mean that Inter's first year
contribution will not be visible, so investors will have to take the
company's word that the rights issue promise to avoid earnings dilution
still holds good.
Price pressure from Japanese competitors at De La Rue Giori and tough
trading conditions in Nigeria may cause some current year forecasts to be
shaved. But while there were inevitably a few profit takers yesterday, the
shares look worth supporting in the long run on a forward multiple of 17.

FT  03 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Thames Water
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by the careful choreography, yesterday's annual results from Thames
Water were designed to avoid offending several constituencies. Hence,
perhaps, the restrained 10 per cent dividend rise, after which cover is
still a fat 2.9 times. Hence also the 10 per cent cut in the chairman's
headline earnings and the emphasis on the scale of this year's capital
spending. After all, Thames scarcely wants to be compared with the likes of
BT.
Perhaps the most significant aspect of the results was the group's
championing of its non-regulated businesses, which made a net profit for the
first time. The declared Pounds 3m figure may have been somewhat flattered
by inter-group transactions, but Thames made its point. Though its sheer
size makes it hard for unregulated profits to have a real impact, in the
long term it will be easier to reward shareholders without alienating
customers if the money is earned away from the basic business.
On that front, Thames can boast impressive progress in reducing losses from
leaking pipes, while its spending programme, including the London ring main,
is comfortably on course. The shares are on a current year multiple of less
than 8 and a yield of 5.8 per cent, which seems adequate protection against
fresh interventions by the regulator.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Denmark rejection of the Maastricht treaty will come as a shock to European
currency and bond markets which have been priming themselves for an opposite
result since the middle of last week. The immediate effect will not only be
an almost certain slide in the price of Danish bonds. The currency could
move closer to its floor within the ERM. But Denmark's problems will be as
nothing to the rethinking that must now begin on the prospects for European
currency union and convergence of interest rates.
The most likely response will be a flow of funds into the D-Mark which will
leave high-interest currencies exposed, especially the lira because of
Italy's political problems, the Ecu, and the Nordic currencies which are not
members of the system. It would be rash, however, for markets to expect an
early realignment. This is a taboo subject.
As for the UK it is left somewhere in the middle with a high budget deficit
and high core inflation rate offsetting the attraction of political
stability that followed the election. Doubtless sterling will continue to
enjoy the support of that stability to some degree. whether it will be
enough to secure inflows sufficient to fund the PSBR at current gilt yields
is another matter.

FT  03 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Phoney war for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Purves of the Hongkong Bank would clearly like his latest offer for
Midland to be seen as a knock-out. At a value of 479p, however, it is only
23p higher than the most attractive option under the original offer. The
cash alternative to the loan stock portion has considerably improved the
structure of the bid, but there is still room for Lloyds to top the price
without undermining its own commercial case for acquiring Midland.
Assuming that this is indeed what happens after the Lloyds board meeting on
Friday, investors will be back to second-guessing the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission. But they would be wrong to assume that it is a simple question
of whether or not the Lloyds case will be rejected. In that case, Takeover
Panel rules would still allow HSBC immediately to slap another bid on the
table, with the crucial proviso that it was recommended by the Midland
board. The risk in sitting tight therefore is that Midland would refuse to
endorse a second HSBC bid.
That HSBC knows this is a weakness in its case is betrayed by its new sense
of urgency. After all the trouble it has gone to, it is almost inconceivable
that HSBC would pass up a second opportunity to bid, though it might be
necessary to spice the deal to win endorsement from a jaded Midland board.
In this context, it is striking that the proposed premium on the loan stock
element has swung from a parsimonious 160 basis points over gilts to an
exceptionally generous 240 points. If HSBC wanted to underwrite more paper
for a fresh offer, it would have little difficulty at this price.
As long as Lloyds can persuade investors that HSBC would remain in the game
after the MMC enquiry, it still has everything to play for. To deter
waverers from selling out, it will need on Friday to signal its absolute
determination to beat its rival bidder if and when it gets the go-ahead from
the competition authorities. That would mean indicating a new price in
excess of 500p to compensate for the admittedly quite small risk that
Midland would be left ultimately without any suitor at all.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Japanese students learnfine art of corporate bow
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOWNTURN in the Japanese economy has claimed another victim, the
pampered university student. In the feverish days of the late 1980s, the
country's students were wined, dined and entertained at beach resorts by
companies in need of young talent to stock their wildly ambitious expansion
plans.
But, as one youth magazine warned yesterday, the wind on the golf course has
changed direction. Toyota Motor announced that its intake of non-technical
graduates will be cut by 18 per cent this year, Nissan by 21 per cent, and
Kawasaki Steel by 28 per cent.
Companies are no longer devising ever more extravagant ways to entice
reluctant students into the fold. Instead worried applicants are attending
politeness courses, polishing their interview techniques and getting the
depth and timing of those bows right.
Meanwhile, the National Personnel Authority, which hires and fires
bureaucrats, says this year's applicants will not be asked to identify their
university. The policy change is an attempt to reduce the bias towards Tokyo
University graduates, who take more than 70 per cent of posts in the choice
ministries.
The NPA's edict is likely to have less impact than the ailing economy. As
the authority itself is overstocked with Tokyo graduates, the old-boy
network which runs the Japanese bureaucracy will ensure that the outsiders
are kept to a necessary minimum.
For Toyota, the cut in graduate hiring is an inevitable reaction to a
year-long slump in the domestic car market: 'We took in so many people when
the economy was growing rapidly. Now the environment has turned sour and we
must cut back.' The same sentiment was expressed by Hitachi, the electronics
company, which says it is taking a 'macro view' and, instead of hiring for
the sake of hiring, it is only hiring for 'necessary posts'.
In the quest for these 'necessary posts', students have taken to consulting
magazines such as Adole, which guides apparently inexperienced students in
the fine art of the corporate bow. Young men should have hands at the side,
coat buttoned, eyes down and take their bow slowly.
As for capturing the look that appeals most to the average Japanese
personnel manager, young men are advised to wear a pastel tie, 'not
stained', carry a brief case, and avoid the double-breasted suit.
Women are told that personnel departments don't like pierced ears and
manicured nails while the skirt hem should not stray too far above the knee,
and hair is best worn up. Shoe heels must be no thicker than 5cm and a
leather document holder makes a good impression.
Having slipped back into sensible shoes and away from vibrant flashes of
individuality, the present generation of students is lamenting that their
graduation will come one year too late.
Last year, they could have anticipated at least one weekend contemplating
job offers in a hot spring at company expense.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Letter: Case not made about need for urgent action on CO
emissions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER SAMUEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Preposterous is the only word for the column by Carlo Ripa di Meana,
the EC's environment commissioner (Personal View: 'Why Rio must deliver',
May 26).
Far from being 'intransigent' the Bush administration went much too far  -
in the view of many here - in seeking compromise with environmental
extremists.
The EC 'green chief' has not made the case that the welfare and survival of
the planet requires urgent action to constrain CO emissions according to the
diktat of an international plan.
The consensus among coolheads is that a catastrophic global warming from
increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, while remotely possible, is highly
unlikely. The models of future climate do not yet explain the actual
climatic record of the past century properly, so their predictions of a
future 3 deg C increase in global temperatures over the next century need to
be taken with a large dose of salt.
Clouds and other feed-back mechanisms may be offsetting much of the
theoretically calculated warming effect of increasing greenhouse gases. Some
of the warming this century - only about 0.5 deg C - may indeed be the
result of an increase in the intensity of the sun, rather than of a
greenhouse gas effect. Moreover, more CO and a warmer global climate might
not be bad for the world, let alone a threat to 'the survival of the
planet', to quote the EC commissioner's absurdly apocalyptic language.
Plant growth would be enhanced by both. Rainfall would be increased. Of
course there would be problems in coping with change, but according to a US
National Academy of Sciences panel on global warming the world can
successfully adapt to prospective climate change.
By contrast, the heavy controls di Meana proposes on CO emissions would put
immediate arbitrary ceilings on electricity generation, heavy industry and
myriad other fossil fuel based activities. The costs of goods and services
foregone in the effort to stave off global warming would almost certainly
outweigh the possible distant costs of adapting to somewhat higher
temperatures worldwide - if they eventuate, which is uncertain.
Even before the climate change treaty is signed at Rio, the European
commissioner is demanding new pressure on the US. His are the words of a
silly zealot demanding mindless actions. We need more science, less zeal.

Any banker who underestimates the importance of luck in making sound lending
decisions should ponder why Sumitomo Bank's name has not figured in the
problems of Olympia &amp; York.
Sumitomo was among the Japanese institutions targeted by Paul Reichmann in
1989 as lead managers for a proposed Dollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan to O&amp;Y.
Sumitomo even ordered kosher meals in preparation for Reichmann's visit to
Tokyo to discuss its involvement.
However, at the last minute, Reichmann phoned to say that he had to stay in
Toronto to care for his ailing mother. The trip never materialised and, to
this day, Sumitomo has no exposure to O&amp;Y. Alas, some other Japanese banks,
notably Dai-Ichi Kangyo and Tokai, were not so fortunate.

It's the tortoise-and-hare story in reverse. Last November, Observer
reported that farmers were hopping mad with slow and ponderous British Rail,
accusing it of neglecting to control the rabbits which breed on railway
embankments and raid the crops in neighbouring fields.
BR's response has been to stone-wall by arguing that there can be no civil
claim against it for the actions of wild animals, while hedging the question
of liability under the Pests Act by insisting that any compensation awards
it makes for the crop-damage are merely ex-gratia payments.
It now looks like being overtaken by the bunnies with the aid of the Country
Landowners' Association, which is mustering members to put a stop to BR's
buck-passing. In particular, a High Court action is being filed by Major
Michael Smallwood, who farms at Honeybourne, Worcestershire, for breach of
the Pests Act.

Investment ombudsman Richard Youard should know what he is talking about in
saying he has a bee in his bonnet about the hoary old investment warning
that the value of shares can go down as well as up. He's a keen amateur
beekeeper.
Moreover, given that he used to be called the investment referee, it is no
surprise that he has a fondness for footballing metaphors when explaining
his annual report. A staged reconstruction of an investment advisory
interview is an 'action replay', for instance. His spoken verdict on the
Dumenil unit trust debacle is that it was unsatis-
factory, but 'that's not to say everybody done it wrong.'
But bees and boots are not the only influences on Youard. A former partner
in City solicitors Slaughter &amp; May, he still plays cornet with his old
firm's jazz band, as one of his comments at yesterday's press conference
showed.
Questioned about an 82-year-old woman who'd been given bad investment
advice, Youard replied: 'Old biddies don't live in tents' - a line from Tin
Roof Blues, one of his band's favourite numbers.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Earth Summit kicks off today with a bizarre award for the mayor of
Mexico City in recognition of what some see as his less than impressive
efforts to reduce the city's pollution levels. The award has surprised
Mexicans, not just because ozone levels this year have reached record
heights, but the measures taken can hardly be held up as a model for the
whole globe.
Earlier this year the mayor took to making almost daily announcements about
who could, and could not, drive their car on a certain day, in a panic
response that seemed designed to create the greatest amount of inconvenience
for the smallest possible benefit. Other more worthy winners - including the
mayors of Saarbrucken in Germany and Kitakyushu in Japan - can hardly take
pleasure from being lumped together with the world's smog capital.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Take 16 large egos, two legal eagles, a few bottles of good Beaujolais, and
the resulting debate should be interesting, especially when the subject is
whether nasty restaurant critics can be taken to the cleaners.
Last month's Pounds 15,000 damages ruling against the Irish Times and its
restaurant reviewer for maligning the output of a local restaurant, has
certainly set some journalistic tummies rumbling.
Yesterday, the owners of the Soho Soho restaurant hosted a lunch in London
to try to settle same while fuelling a debate on whether it's possible to
prevent similar financial penalties from spilling over into the much more
expensive market in mainland Britain. Eleven restaurant writers and five
restaurateurs were plumped down at the same table with Alastair Brett, a
Times libel lawyer, and journalist Adam Raphael, keeping the score.
Not surprisingly, there were almost as many verdicts as there were diners.
Richard Shepherd from Langan's, who set an unprofessional example by not
eating the grilled salmon with basil sauce but smoking throughout, called
for more understanding of the emotion of eating out. By contrast, Pizza
Express's Peter Boizot quoted Shakespeare and St Augustine to back his
thesis that critics should at least have to inspect the kitchens before
sounding off.
The writers' team seemed to be under the impression that - as long as they
got their facts right and, when inaccurate, allowed the restaurateur the
right of reply - there should be no problem. However, there is a growing
lobby which believes it is only a matter of time before a particularly nasty
review detonates a law suit.
Unless our libel laws are changed, they can only hope that the case comes up
before a judge who, forsaking his chambers, enjoys eating out.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Liffe's new era of management
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The board of the London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange
(Liffe) yesterday voted in Nicholas Durlacher as the new chairman,
succeeding David Burton. He has been deputy chairman for the past four years
and stood unopposed at the board meeting, as was expected.
Durlacher is unlikely to push for any major change of course at Liffe, which
merged with the London Traded Options Market earlier this year.
However, the troubled merger, and last year's move to new premises at Cannon
Bridge in London does signal a new era for the management of the exchange.
Liffe is still searching for a replacement for Michael Jenkins, chief
executive of the exchange, who is stepping down in the autumn. Jenkins is to
be the new chairman of the London Futures and Options Exchange (FOX).
Durlacher yesterday vowed to 'fulfil the potential' of the equity product
range, revive the ailing Ecu bond future and develop new products, including
possibly an insurance contract.
The appointment of a new deputy chairman will be the subject of next month's
Liffe board meeting. One possibility is to nominate two deputy chairmen,
hence dividing up responsibilities for the equity and interest rate side.
Such a move might help placate former members of the London Traded Options
Market, who had pushed for, and been denied, a managing director to take
specific charge of equity options following the merger.
With the chairmanship of Liffe taking at least two days a week, Durlacher
intends to continue as chairman of Barclays de Zoete Wedd Futures but to
relinquish more of the day-to-day running of the firm to Graham Newell, who
took up the position of chief executive last October.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Management: Full of beans but unable to fight fatigue - Dr
Michael McGannon explains why it is risky to drink too much coffee / Health
Check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Dr MICHAEL MCGANNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Fatigue is a serious problem for the manager of the 1990s. Unfortunately,
the remedy chosen by most people - a cup of coffee, or five or six - may be
more serious still. By automatically reaching for the coffee pot, managers
may be adding to their fatigue, increasing sleeplessness, and making their
bodies unable to deal with jet-lag.
Caffeine, which was introduced by Arabs in the 15th century, has long been
used to bolster flagging energy levels. However it is becoming increasingly
clear that there is a level at which caffeine stops being a harmless
stimulant to the central nervous system and becomes an irritant and health
hazard.
In moderation, caffeine consumption poses no serious health problem. However
the difficulty is to determine exactly what this safe level is: it depends
on how the coffee (or to a lesser extent, tea) was prepared.
Caffeine comes from a family of stimulants which come from coffee beans, tea
leaves, cocoa beans and cola nuts, and are used in headache pills,
anti-sleep pills, pain-killers, diet and allergy pills, anti-asthma pills
and flavourings.
Coffee is the most concentrated form of caffeine: an espresso contains at
least 300 milligrams, whereas a cup of American-style brewed coffee has only
100 mgs. Tea and most colas contain about half that. To confuse matters
further, some people are more sensitive to caffeine than others.
This makes it is hard to establish a clear causal relationship between
consumption of caffeine and its ill effects, although it is generally agreed
that in excessive quantities (500-1,000 mgs) and in sensitive people,
caffeine damages both mental and physical performance.
The most common symptoms are: rapid and irregular heart beats, increased
breathing rates, dehydration and mineral loss, increased production of
stomach acid (possibly leading to ulcers, sleeplessness, irritability and
tremulousness.
WHAT TO DO
If you have a heart problem, ulcers, or are pregnant, caffeine, in all its
forms, is off-limits. Consider herbal teas or orange juice instead.
Those not in these risk groups, should monitor the symptoms to assess their
own caffeine threshold. If you feel nervous, tremulous or cannot sleep, ask
yourself how much caffeine you have consumed that day.
If you are particularly sensitive, check labels on foods. There may be a
hidden sources of caffeine, such as chocolate.
If you genuinely enjoy the taste, shift to decaffeinated, or drink tea.
Enjoy beverages that contain caffeine for the taste and effect, but
compensate for the fluid loss by drinking more water and eating more fruit.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Management: Bringing order to the AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Company chairmen need no longer dread the yearly circus of the AGM. There is
no further need to stand up unprotected, fielding a barrage of awkward
questions about the dividend policy and the group's dubious employment
policies in South Africa.
A new computer system promises to make AGMs into well co-ordinated
productions in which the company pulls all the strings. As shareholders
arrive, they log questions into a computer. The questions are automatically
sorted according to subject matter and transmitted to the relevant company
expert. He or she can then put together a tactful answer that the chairman
simply reads off his Autocue.
Shareholders are given badges so that they can be summoned to the microphone
with minimum fuss when their turn comes.
The new system, called Q+A, has been developed by Q-TV Prompting, a computer
company based in north London. At Pounds 1,500 to Pounds 3,000 for hire of
equipment and staff for a meeting, it is expected to appeal mainly to larger
companies.
Cynics might wonder whether the technological wizardry of large AGMs has not
already gone too far. Video shows and special effects are now de rigueur for
larger companies, while the typical small shareholder is often more
interested in a free glass of sherry.
As for awkward challenges, chairmen have already been well rehearsed by
their PR companies on how to get around analysts' probing questions at the
time of the results. Other shareholders may have nothing more to ask than
about the shortage of of wholemeal muffins in the Croydon branch. Answering
that should be a piece of cake, even without a computer.
The newly-privatised utilities - which are expected to be natural buyers of
Q+A because of their armies of shareholders - already seem to be overdoing
their AGMs. British Gas hired the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham
for its first meeting, expecting a good turnout from its millions of private
investors. In the event only a handful turned up. More recently, a similar
fate befell Scottish Power.

SOTHEBY'S had a very disappointing silver sale in London yesterday. It

the most important lot, a soup tureen made in 1736 by Paul de Lamerie,

Sotheby's was hoping for bids in excess of Pounds 750,000 for the
rococo-styled tureen but it was bought in at Pounds 650,000.

Cork Gully, the receiver, decided Surestyle had no chance of being sold as a

talk of the business having badwill rather than goodwill.'
The company's debts are smaller than expected. About 150 directly employed

FT  03 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: The bell tolls for a party
traditionalist - Ivo Dawnay on Gerald Kaufman'sunhitching from Labour's
wagon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Gerald Kaufman is a politician whose greatest achievements have been in
keeping fragile projects on the road - not least the survival of his party.
Early in his 22-year parliamentary career he cajoled the New York
authorities into allowing Concorde landing rights at Kennedy airport.
Last year he sweet-talked the Labour party through the political minefield
of the Gulf war while completing, as if by sleight of hand, the most
difficult policy U-turn of all by bringing it back to a multilateralist
nuclear policy.
But yesterday the caustic, oddball shadow foreign secretary himself opted
for the political lay-by of the backbenches - becoming, after Mr Neil
Kinnock and Mr Roy Hattersley, the third of the party's heavyweights to
unhitch his wagon from the party leadership. Only Mr John Smith now remains.
His decision, along with a parallel one not to stay on the party's national
executive to which he finally won election only last year, is another toll
of the bell for the few Labour MPs who remember the evermore distant years
of power.
In part, it represents a job completed. After Mr Kinnock himself, Mr
Kaufman's persistence made him one of the foremost players in the struggle
to drag Labour back from the cul-de-sac it reached in the election defeat of
1983.
Yesterday he claimed that his mood was one of 'celebration' not of
depression. But he also conceded that the party's defeat on April 9 had been
the greatest disappointment of his career.
On the Saturday after polling, he related bitterly yesterday how he had
toured his impoverished inner-city constituency of Manchester Gorton,
confessing to voters that nothing would be done for them for the next four
years.
He believes that despite the 40-seat gains and other psephological crumbs of
comfort the defeat had been 'ignominious.'
At heart a traditionalist and firm believer in the 'one last heave' revival
strategy, rather than any wide-ranging cultural change, he concedes that
Labour must overcome a deep residual mistrust of the party - a by-product
largely of what he saw as the Bennites' attempt in the early 1980s to mount
a coup d'etat.
For the seventh child of an immigrant Polish tailor, Mr Kaufman's career has
been as successful as his party's has been a failure.
Brought-up in respectable working-class Leeds, he graduated via the city's
grammar school to Queen's College, Oxford. From the chairmanship of the
Labour Club, he took up a career in political journalism, shifting over to
Harold (now Lord) Wilson's staff in 1965.
His ambition became apparent on his election in 1970, when he turned down
the party leader's offer to act as his parliamentary private secretary on
the grounds that it was time to be his own man.
Four years later he emerged from the Labour victory as environment
under-secretary to the late Tony Crosland, moving on to industry minister
and then, after 1979, to shadow environment, the home office and, latterly,
foreign affairs.
With characteristic immodesty, Mr Kaufman made much yesterday of his
personal triumphs - 12 times elected to the shadow cabinet, he is also the
only Labour MP who has increased his majority at every election since 1970.
But much of the respect he has commanded on Labour's backbenches has been
won by the artful application of his acidic scorn to the Tories. Rare among
Labour's liberal quasi-intellectuals, he also commanded loyalty and
affection among the party rank and file.
Yesterday, before contemplating with pleasure the prospect of having time to
resume his love affair with the movies, Mr Kaufman claimed he had not sought
power but 'the ability to do things'.
At 61, and with no prospect of office for four years, he has now done, in a
Tory phrase, the only decent thing remaining to him.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Patten orders urgent review of school technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN PATTEN, the education secretary, yesterday launched an urgent review
of the curriculum for technology at schools in England and Wales, following
a highly critical report by the schools inspectorate.
The report highlights the ill-effects of the devolution of most funding from
local education authorities to schools, one of the government's key
education policies.
'At a time when teachers need advice and support with the introduction of
technology,' said the inspectorate, 'many local authorities have reduced the
number of advisory teachers and closed technology in-service training
centres, often in order to reduce expenditure and to enable them to delegate
more money to schools'.
The inspectorate found that at primary level much technology teaching was
constrained 'by the teachers' limited technological capability,' while at
secondary level barely half of all lessons in design and technology observed
were satisfactory or better, with lesson planning in the subject
'piecemeal'.
At both levels, schools had difficulty in providing challenging work for
more advanced pupils.
In a Commons written answer, Mr Patten said the review, to be conducted by
the inspectorate, was intended 'to specify more clearly the skills and
knowledge which pupils should acquire at each stage' and 'to enhance the
practical element' in the curriculum.
'I am determined to increase teachers' expectations of childrens'
abilities,' said Mr Patten.
A new curriculum framework for school technology is expected to be
introduced in 1994 for pupils up to 14, and a year later for pupils over 14.
This will involve new syllabuses for GCSE.
Mr Patten's action was also promoted by advice from the National Curriculum
Council, an advisory body, which urged a review to relate conceptual work in
technology more closely with practical skills, and to reduce the complexity
of the curriculum.
The Engineering Council, which published a sharply critical report on the
issue last month, said: 'technology should be a subject in which students
design and make useful products or systems, developing their ability to
solve practical problems.'
Independent boarding schools should be eligible to opt for grant-maintained
status and become fully-fledged state schools, according to the director of
the Independent Schools Information Service.
Pupil numbers at independent boarding schools have fallen by more than 10
per cent in the last three years, and the call is seen as further evidence
of the plight of the sector.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Biffen challengesclaims of recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN, Parliamentary Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT optimism about the prospects for the economy was challenged by Mr
John Biffen (C Shropshire North), a former Treasury minister in the Commons
last night.
Earlier Mr John Major, the prime minister, highlighted the growth in
business confidence since the Conservatives secured their fourth successive
election victory.
During question time he told Labour critics who emphasised the continuing
rise in un-employment and the trade deficit that he preferred the views of
the Confederation of British Industry and other business organisations who
knew 'rather more about it'.
Mr Biffen, speaking in the debate on the second reading on the Finance Bill,
contended that, even in the most generous terms, the revival in the economy
could only be described as tentative.
Mr Biffen warned that in seeking to reconcile fiscal, public-spending and
monetary objectives the government was engaged in an exercise of increasing
difficulty.
Acknowledging that interest rates had fallen since sterling entered the
'Lubjanka' of the exchange rate mechanism, he maintained that they were
still at an extraordinary level in real terms.
Mr Biffen stressed: 'I do not believe that we can have a balanced
inter-related economic policy without a reduction in interest rates'.
He questioned whether it would be a 'national disaster' if there were some
adjustment to sterling's position in the ERM.
Mr Biffen said Mr Michael Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, faced a
formidable task in the coming negotiations over public-expenditure levels in
disciplining the spending departments.
The finance bill was given a second reading by a government majority of 52
(308-256).

FT  03 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Bank will not censure BCCI case
broker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bank of England has shrugged off concern expressed by a Commons'
committee and decided it cannot discipline a firm of brokers who acted for
the Western Isles Islands Council which lost Pounds 24m in the Bank of
Credit and Commerce International collapse.
A letter sent to the clerk of the Treasury committee says the Bank judges
evidence on the role of R P Martin, 'still to be conflicting, and
insufficient to find the allegations against R P Martin proven'.
The Bank's comments follow a report by the committee last December, which
said there was prima facie evidence to invalidate the Bank of England's
initial conclusion - that there was no evidence of a breach by brokers of
the code of practice for the City's wholesale financial markets.
The Treasury select committee has not been set up since the general election
but the Bank's letter will be made available to MPs.
Some MPs may remain uneasy about the role of the brokers acting for local
authorities investing in BCCI, Mr Terence Higgins, former chairman of the
Treasury committee, yesterday welcomed revisions to the code that the Bank
announced last week.
The committee called in its report for the Bank to re-open investigations
into R P Martin. In response, the Bank held further discussions with
individuals at the broker's Edinburgh offices and with staff at the Western
Isles Council.
It found that the only area not disputed was the absence of taping of
conversations in R P Martin's Edinburgh offices - but that did not amount to
a breach, the Bank said.
However, the new code 'strongly recommends' taping of dealers' conversations
and the letter says Bank officials have discussed with R P Martin its policy
on taping 'and will be asking for a review of this policy in the light of
the revised code'.
The committee's concerns over R P Martin centred on a trip to the Western
Isles made by a BCCI representative with a representative of the brokers.
The MPs said that, 'joint visits, however arranged, may be taken as an
endorsement of the borrowing counterparty by the broker. While we completely
accept that it is for depositing counterparties to assess creditworthiness,
it is still important that brokers take no action which may be
misunderstood.'
In its letter to the committee, the Bank says such concerns have been
reflected in the revised code.

FT  03 JUN 92 / DPP urges Lord Mackay to widen advocacy rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Barbara Mills QC, director of public prosecutions, and Sir James Nursaw
QC, head of the Government Legal Service, yesterday called on the Lord
Chancellor to give barristers in the employed sector the right to appear as
advocates in the higher courts.
In a joint submission to Lord Mackay, they argue that if he approves a Bar
Council rule that bans all employed barristers from appearing in the higher
courts he will shut the door on wider advocacy rights for Crown Prosecution
Service and government barristers forever.
This would be inconsistent with recent advice from his advisory committee
that CPS lawyers should be granted advocacy rights at some stage. Mrs Mills
and Sir James suggest Lord Mackay should ask the Bar to amend its rule to
reflect this.
Granting rights of audience to employed lawyers would both improve the
administration of justice and be in the public interest, they claim.
At the moment, more than 60 per cent of instructions to counsel are returned
just before the hearing so that a new and possibly unknown barrister is
brought in at the last minute. If rights of audience were available to
employed lawyers, in some cases it would be possible to use an experienced
GLS or CPS advocate with knowledge of the case.
The Bar is vehemently opposed to CPS lawyers having advocacy rights in the
Crown Court. It fears the CPS would take on the bulk of prosecution work
itself and deprive young barristers in private practice of much of their
bread and butter income, putting the future of an independent Bar at risk.
The CPS says it is the Bar's largest client and has a vested interest in
ensuring that it survives. Mrs Mills says it would undertake no more than
15-20 per cent of Crown Court prosecution work with all major trials
continuing to be handled by private practitioners.
Their joint submission follows a recommendation made to the Lord Chancellor
last month by Sir Gordon Borrie, the outgoing director general of fair
trading that the Bar's rule was anti-competitive and should be removed.
Although it is now more than four years since Lord Mackay first signalled
the end of the Bar's 200-year monopoly on advocacy in the higher courts his
office said yesterday that he was still several months away from a final
decision on the issue.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Trader passed on accused broker's 'rumours'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER head of UK equity trading at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank,
agreed yesterday that he had described as 'rumours' and 'stories'
information he had been given by a stockbroker now accused of attempted
market rigging.
Mr Timothy Medland, now a stocktrader with Swiss Bank Corporation, was a
prosecution witness at the trial at Knightsbridge Crown Court of Mr Peter
Marks, a director of Branston and Gothard.
Mr Marks has pleaded not guilty to a charge under section 47 of the
Financial Services Act of making a misleading, false or deceptive statement
to induce share dealing.
The prosecution alleges that, as part of an attempted 'bear raid', Mr Marks
told Mr Medland on October 12, 1990, that Maxwell Communication Corporation
would be filing for bankruptcy that day - knowing it to be untrue.
The conversation took place between two others in which Mr Marks agreed to
sell two blocks of 100,000 MCC shares to Goldman Sachs.
Cross-examined by Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, for Mr Marks, Mr Medland said the
information had been presented to him by Mr Marks as 'a statement of fact'.
He agreed that Mr Marks had ended by asking him if he had any comment and
had appeared to be looking for information.
Mr Medland also agreed that when giving evidence in the case at magistrates'
court he had called what Mr Marks had told him 'rumours'.
He also accepted that when he had reported the matter to Mr Eric Sheinberg,
Goldman Sachs managing director in New York, he had spoken of 'stories . . .
circulating . . . that (MCC) have gone under'.
Mr Richard Lines, an investigator with the Stock Exchange insider dealing
group, said that when interviewed Mr Marks had said he had merely been
passing on to Goldman Sachs a story he had heard was 'going the rounds'.
Mr Lines said that Mr Marks had said that he had not known if it was true,
but had telephoned Goldman Sachs, with which his firm had dealt before,
because it was known to be a big buyer of Maxwell shares.
The trial continues today.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: TGWU to back Smith and Beckett
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE executive of the TGWU general union yesterday decided to back Mr John
Smith and Mrs Margaret Beckett for the leadership and deputy leadership of
the Labour party.
The union holds the biggest single block of Labour's electoral college, with
8 per cent of the votes, nearly one quarter of the 40 per cent union vote.
The shadow chief secretary has recently faced a challenge from Mr John
Prescott, shadow transport secretary.
Mr Prescott, who has been defending Labour's traditional links with the
unions, has won endorsement from Nupe, the public services union, and GPMU,
the print union.
But the Beckett camp was last night pointing out that Mrs Beckett had also
won the endorsement of the Rhondda constituency in south Wales, a
traditional Labour stronghold.
Mr Gordon Brown, Mrs Beckett's campaign manager, said that she was already
leading among MPs, and that her campaign had 'a strong momentum in the
constituency parties and amongst trade unionists.
'Her campaign is uniting the party,' he claimed.
Branches covering about 25 per cent of the TGWU's membership responded to
the union's consultation exercise over the leadership. Mr Smith won about 83
per cent support for the leadership. In the deputy race Mrs Beckett won 46
per cent, Mr Prescott 39 per cent and Mr Gould 15 per cent.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Investment sales methods under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INVESTMENT ombudsman yesterday strongly criticised selling methods in
the industry, saying that most disputes arose out of misunderstandings of
what clients had requested.
The ombudsman, Mr Richard Youard, said cases referred to him had decreased
in the year to the end of March to 67, from 89 in the previous year. The
number of cases resolved rose from 98 to 100. But there had been a big
increase in the amount paid out in compensation, with a rise from Pounds
22,655 to Pounds 114,272. The largest amount paid in a settlement was Pounds
25,031, up from Pounds 8,715 last year. About half the cases were resolved
in favour of the complainant.
Mr Youard said the fall in complaints - which contrasts with a marked
increase in criticism of banks, building societies and insurance companies -
was probably caused by the recession, which discouraged stock market
investment while increasing reliance on banks and building societies.
In his criticism of selling methods he referred to the lack of notes taken
by salesmen at interviews. 'It's quite possible for a salesman to be a
salesman and an adviser at the same time but it's difficult, and because a
salesman instinctively sells, things can go wrong.'
Mr Youard also criticised the level of cost disclosure for unit-trust
products. These comments may have an impact on the Securities and
Investments Board's review of retail investment regulation, which has
settled on disclosure rules for life assurance but has yet to make firm
proposals on unit-trust disclosure.
The ombudsman said the 'health warning' on unit-trust marketing material,
which says that the price of units can go down as well as up, was
misunderstood. 'What in my view, is required as a matter of urgency is the
abandonment of the present warning and its substitution in a prominent form
by such words as 'you may get back less than you invested'.'
He also found that the 'bid/offer' price-spread for unit trusts was
misunderstood. He said he would be delighted if the expression were
abandoned for ever 'since I have seen far too many cases where it has been
wholly misunderstood by the investor'. It should be substituted, he said,
with a simple statement that the cost of the manager's services would be
deducted from the investment on the first day.
The investment ombudsman deals with disputes between customers and members
of Imro, the Investment Managers' Regulatory Office.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Labour council chief warms to contracting-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A MARKED shift in Labour's attitude to the contracting-out of services to
the private sector was signalled yesterday by one of the party's senior
local government leaders.
Mr Jeremy Beecham, head of the Labour-dominated Association of Metropolitan
Authorities and leader of Newcastle upon Tyne council, said that quality of
service, not the identity of its provider, should be Labour's prime concern.
Mr Beecham told the the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and
Accountancy's annual conference that he conceded 'pressure on the
competitive tendering front will continue'. He added: 'Local government has
to recognise that the public is not intrinsically interested in who is
providing a service but in what kind of service they receive.'
Labour fought the election committed to ending compulsory competitive
tendering (CCT), a policy bitterly opposed by unions in local government.
Instead, on Mr Beecham's initiative, it proposed to establish a quality
commission charged with monitoring and spreading best practice. The
commission would have been empowered to enforce tendering only as a last
resort.
Mr Beecham's endorsement of CCT yesterday was far from grudging. Pointing to
the division it necessitated between a council's roles as purchaser and
provider of services, he claimed it had 'caused a re-examination of
performance, with generally beneficial results'.
The emphasis, he said, ought to be on quality. 'The promotion of quality
should assist local authorities in the competitive process, providing we
ensure that quality is written into contract specifications, (and) that we
are equipped to monitor performance whether of our own workforce or the
private sector.'
A report last week by the Institute of Public Finance revealed that a
majority of local authorities now contract out at least one of their main
services to the private sector. A fifth of them were found to contract out
three or more services. It also showed private-sector competition to be
intensifying.
Mr Beecham's remarks will have wide ramifications, both among Labour
councillors and the party's soon-to-be-elected leadership.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Mackay set to rule on rent arrears law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD MACKAY, the Lord Chancellor, is likely to decide by the end of the
month on reforms to the controversial law which allows landlords in England
and Wales to recover rent due from defaulting tenants from previous tenants
of the same property.
The pressure imposed by the existing system prompted an announcement
yesterday from Grand Metropolitan Estates, the property subsidiary of the UK
food and drinks group, that it intends to waive the liability for many of
its tenants of public houses.
Lord Mackay is likely to recommend that tenants should only guarantee the
rents of their immediate successor. The changes, proposed by the Law
Commission in 1988, are unlikely to become law before the end of next year.
Tenants have been lobbying for a change in the law for the past six months.
Some have received rent demands for premises they occupied up to 25 years
ago. Landlords have been equally outspoken about the need to preserve a law
underpinning the security of a property's rental income.
The Conservative party manifesto, which promised to consider putting the Law
Commission's proposals into effect, suggested that the changes would apply
to new commercial leases. Lord Mackay is likely to recommend that the
principles be applied to any assignment that takes place once the
legislation is implemented.
GrandMet Estates will offer many of its 8,000 tenants the right to waive
their liability for rent owed by successors, in return for the payment of 10
per cent of the premium received on assigning a lease. Corporate tenants and
those with more than one pub will not be offered the new terms.
Mr Bob Williams, chairman of GrandMet Estates, said he did not support a
general change in the the law, which he felt was important for long-term
property investors. He felt, however, that the existing law was
inappropriate for individuals.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Shake-up in business support: Enterprise agencies' umbrella
organisation to scale back direct involvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS IN the Community, the umbrella body for Britain's local enterprise
agencies, plans to reduce its direct involvement with the agencies.
BITC hopes to encourage the 300-plus agencies - which provide advice and
training to start-ups and small businesses, with backing from the private
sector - to create their own regional and national organisations.
If the body's board approves the proposal at a meeting next week, there are
plans for a conference of heads of enterprise agencies to launch an
agency-run organisation in October.
The ending of BITC's special relationship with the enterprise agency
movement marks a further significant shift in the business-support network.
The body plans to concentrate more of its resources on working with its
members - private-sector companies involved in community activities - and to
reflect the broader community concerns of these companies.
In a recent confidential draft of its proposals the body said: 'BITC has
widened its involvement to include such things as education, the environment
and general community affairs. It is therefore no longer automatic that BITC
and the enterprise agencies will always share the same priorities.'
It is also responding to the growing diversity of business-support
organisations. This means it is no longer appropriate for it to be linked
too closely with just one provider of business support. It will continue to
help the enterprise agencies while the national network is set up, but plans
to extend its support to chambers of commerce, training and enterprise
councils, and the Prince's Youth Business Trust.
It also plans to continue to provide help to the enterprise agencies during
the change-over period to their own national network.
Mr David Grayson, BITC managing director of operations, said: 'We are not
walking away from the enterprise agencies.' Preparations for an end to the
relationship and discussions with leaders of the enterprise agencies had
been under way since 1988.
However, reaction to the proposal from the enterprise agencies was mixed.
'We will lose out by not having someone to represent our views to
government,' commented one director.
Another said: 'Some agencies have wanted to get away from the BITC link but
others will be disappointed. I am worried that this will reduce the impact
of the work that has been done to encourage big companies to help small
businesses. The agencies will have to work out how to put over their
message.'

THE National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, yesterday
called on the BBC World Service to improve its efficiency.
The report paid tribute to the World Service's independence and high
standard of broadcasting. It also found that the organisation - which
broadcasts in 38 languages to an audience of 120m - had 'a generally
satisfactory system of resource planning and financial management, and had
developed comprehensive procedures to assess the effectiveness of its
output'.
The watchdog called for: Further apportioning of overheads to individual
services.
The continuation of improvements to weak cashflow forecasting. Improvements
in the use of studios and in deploying studio managers.
Greater use of appraisal techniques to justify capital spending.
Further assessment of the impact of the Pounds 166m spent over the past 10
years to improve the audibility of broadcasts.
The Foreign Office paid Pounds 143m to fund the World Service in 1991-92 -
not including Pounds 16m for monitoring other foreign broadcasts.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Radioactive waste repository delayed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UK NIREX, the nuclear-waste consortium, yesterday an-nounced a one-year
delay in submitting its planning application for Britain's first underground
repository for radio-active waste.
Nirex said the delay was because it had insufficient information on the
hydro-geology of the Sellafield area of Cumbria, its preferred site.
The delay is not expected to increase the cost on the Pounds 2.5bn project
significantly.
Nirex had expected that its first four test boreholes would provide enough
information for it to submit a planning application late this year.
But water flows at deep levels seemed to be 'slow and sluggish', Mr Michael
Folger, Nirex managing director, said yesterday. This made it much more
important to obtain information from two proposed test boreholes on
fellsides in the Lake District National Park.
The Lake District Special Planning Board has refused permission for drilling
because of fears of harm to the landscape, noise and disturbance. Nirex is
lodging an appeal, which may trigger a public inquiry by the Department of
the Environment.
Nirex said it did not expect to drill the boreholes before the first half of
next year. It now aims to make a decision on a planning application for the
repository by autumn next year. The revised target date for the
800-metre-deep repository to begin operating is 2006.
Cumbria County Council, which is pressing for a more wide-ranging inquiry,
welcomed the delay. Friends of the Earth, the environmental group, said
Nirex must now realise it had the wrong design in the wrong place, and
should back down.
Britain is to approach the Commonwealth of Independent States for permission
to send a research vessel to the Kara Sea, south of the Arctic Ocean, where
radioactive waste was dumped by the former Soviet Union.
British officials want to study the movement of radioactivity from the dump
area. Radioactivity has been detected in the sea around Greenland, and
scientists believe contamination may be spreading.

BRITISH investigators probing the collapse of companies controlled by Robert
Maxwell have yet to contact the Liechtenstein lawyers associated with many
of the secretive companies in the group.
Liechtenstein lawyers are normally reluctant to reveal information about
their clients, who tend to be wealthy people seeking to hide assets from tax
collectors. But the tiny alpine principality - wedged between Austria and
Switzerland - does not want to be a haven for serious crime, and Mr
Maxwell's Liechtenstein associates made clear as long ago as January that
they were eager to co-operate on the case with British investigators.
However, Mr Werner Keicher, a lawyer in the Vaduz-based trust advisory firm,
Allgemeines Treuunternehmen (General Trust), said this week that he had not
yet been approached by the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) or any other British
authorities.
Mr Keicher is a director of the Maxwell Foundation, which was the main
Liechtenstein vehicle used by Mr Maxwell to control many of his interests.
Mr Maxwell also set up through Allgemeines Treuunternehmen at least six
other Liechtenstein-based foundations, at least one of which was used to
conceal the source of funds for propping up the price of Maxwell
Communication Corporation shares.
Under Liechtenstein law, lawyers can co-operate with foreign investigations
only if the beneficiaries of the foundations waive their right to secrecy or
if the foreign government concerned requests co-operation in connection with
a criminal inquiry.
The formal procedure for making an official request for co-operation from a
foreign country is quite complicated, passing through various agencies of
the two countries concerned. Inquiries also have to be put in very precise
terms that comply with, in this case, Liechtenstein law.
Mr Keicher said he had the impression that the British authorities were
well-informed about the Liechtenstein side of the Maxwell story. 'There are
no assets here, no money. Perhaps they decided it was not worth it,' he
said.
The Serious Fraud Office yesterday refused to comment, saying the matter
concerned operational details of its investigation.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Investigators probe network of 'war chests'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ACCOUNTS of Fivetell, one of the companies being examined by
investigators trying to find assets outside the control of the
administrators to the collapsed Maxwell empire, provide an insight into the
activities controlled by members of the family.
Fivetell was created by Robert Maxwell in 1984 to purchase a substantial
stake in Derby County Football Club, which he bought after a winding-up
petition earlier that year was withdrawn. Headington Investments, one of the
main Maxwell holding companies, had a substantial shareholding in Fivetell.
Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell are listed as the two directors of the
company in the latest documents filed with Companies House on February 25
this year. Both are also shown as directors of another company called
Panlor, and Mr Kevin Maxwell is also a director of Oxford United Football
Club.
The majority stakes in Panlor are owned by Pandora, the wife of Mr Kevin
Maxwell, and Laura, the wife of Mr Ian Maxwell.
Mr Kevin Maxwell is shown as having held more than 270 other company
directorships, and Mr Ian Maxwell is shown as holding 170.
Mr Ian Maxwell is also listed as a shareholder in Fivetell, while Mr Kevin
Maxwell is shown to have shareholdings in London &amp; Bishopsgate Holdings,
Marblue, Newton, Chambers &amp; Co, Oxford United Football Club and Sheenwood
First Nominees.
The accounts of Fivetell for the year to May 31 1991 show that a loan of
Pounds 3m - believed to be unsecured - was made after the accounts were
approved.
Fivetell also had an outstanding loan of Pounds 622,000 last year to
Publishing and Databank Consultants, controlled by the Maxwell estate. The
loan has since been repaid.
There may also have been a loan - the status of which is disputed - for
about Pounds 2m from Fivetell to Oxford United Football Club.
The Fivetell accounts show a pre-tax profit of Pounds 726,000 for the year,
and a deficiency of assets of Pounds 1.4m.
Fivetell appears to have been used to hold the family stakes in Oxford
United as well as Derby County. Both stakes were sold through Robert
Maxwell's estate, which is in receivership.
Documents for Panlor - which Mr Kevin Maxwell and Mr Ian Maxwell are shown
to be directors of - show that the company was created on December 20 last
year. No accounts have yet been filed, but the documents show the two
'allottees', holding 49 shares each, are Mrs Pandora Maxwell and Mrs Laura
Maxwell.
Mr Neil Cooper of Robson Rhodes, the accountancy firm, who is liquidator to
Bishopsgate Investment Management, manager and trustee of the Maxwell
pension funds, said he was aware of a number of 'little puddles of money
left around' in different companies and trusts which may have been 'war
chests'.
'We still don't know the full ramifications of any of these strange
companies,' he said. 'But there is still a great deal of energy being spent
investigating and tracking them down.'

MR OCTAV Botnar, chairman and managing director of Nissan UK, was yesterday
described in the High Court in London as a 'fugitive from justice'.
Counsel for Mr Stan Cholaj, a former Nissan UK assistant managing director
who is claiming Pounds 1m damages for wrongful dismissal and breach of
contract, alleged that Mr Botnar 'attends trials wherever in the world it is
in his interests to do so'.
A warrant was issued by the Inland Revenue for the arrest of Mr Botnar in
January, when another present Nissan UK director and a former director were
also arrested. They were charged with corporation tax fraud. Mr Botnar was
on holiday at his Swiss home, and has not since returned to the UK.
Mr Michael Supperstone QC, counsel for Mr Cholaj, opposed the admission of
written evidence by Mr Botnar, and said he 'cannot stay in his sanctuary in
Switzerland as a fugitive from justice and put in his evidence at this
hearing'.
Mr Anthony Boswood QC, counsel for Nissan UK, presented a medical
certificate from a Swiss doctor claiming that Mr Botnar had a heart
condition.
He also read from an affidavit in which Mr Richard Fleck, a partner of
Herbert Smith, the City solicitors representing Nissan UK in its
investigation by the Revenue, stated that his firm had advised Mr Botnar not
to return to the UK until the Inland Revenue had indicated what charges it
planned against him.
Mr Supperstone said that since the first medical certificate had been
provided in February Mr Botnar 'has travelled the 6,000 miles to Japan and
back but not the short distance to the UK'.
Judge Laurie ruled that he would allow Mr Botnar's written evidence. The
hearing continues tomorrow.

from football ventures
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR KEVIN MAXWELL, former chief executive of Maxwell Communication
Corporation, was yesterday working from the London office of a
Liechtenstein-controlled company with links to the Maxwell family.
It is one of a number of Maxwell enterprises which investigators fear are
beyond the reach of administrators, creditors and pension funds where more
than Pounds 400m is missing.
The listed four-storey building on Wardrobe Place, off London's Ludgate
Hill, was rented more than a month ago on behalf of Sphere Inc, a California
computer games publisher which pays Pounds 26,000 a year in rent. Robert
Maxwell bought an 80 per cent stake in the company which is held by the
Maxwell Charitable Trust in Liechtenstein. Sphere is a fast-expanding
company, trading as Spectrum Holobyte, which is expected to have a turnover
of Dollars 20m (Pounds 10.95m) this year.
Mr Maxwell was working on the ground floor of the building with two
secretaries around lunchtime yesterday. He left at 3pm, carrying a briefcase
and accompanied by another man, before hailing a taxi. He refused to say
what he was doing in the building. 'It's a comment that I have made before
but, for reasons which I hope you will find understandable, I cannot talk to
the press at this time,' he said.
He added: 'You are no different from any other press. That is not meant to
be disrespectful. Circumstances have changed. I am afraid I cannot talk at
the moment.'
The office, rented from estate agents Sinclair Goldsmith six weeks ago, is
intended to be the London sales office of Sphere Inc. The deal was done
almost entirely on the telephone - something the estate agents thought
unusual. A six-month deposit and the first-quarter payment were made in
advance.
The person renting the offices gave his name as Mr Paul Cohen, but did not
leave a business card.
Mr Peter Gray of Sinclair Goldsmith said: 'He said he was acting for Sphere
but it was all very vague.' A Paul Cohen is listed in the MCC staff
directory as group estate adviser of Headington Investments, which was the
main private holding of Robert Maxwell's business empire.
The telephone number given to the estate agents by Mr Cohen is the same as
the home number listed in the internal MCC directory.
Asked yesterday whether he had rented the new offices for Sphere Inc Mr
Cohen said: 'I have no idea what you are talking about.'
The only outside form of identification on the building at Number 2 Wardrobe
Place yesterday was a notice on one of the windows of a planning application
submitted to the City of London Corporation by Sphere Inc on May 19. The
application is for an alteration to a listed building and involves the
proposed installation of a security camera.
At about 12.45pm yesterday the door was opened by a woman who would not
identify herself. Claiming that she was renting an upstairs room, the woman
said there was no company by the name of Sphere Inc in the building, and
denied there was anybody else working there.
Mr Gray said yesterday that as far as he knew Sphere had taken a lease on
the whole building. The claims made by the woman did not 'add up' with his
information, he said. 'This is strange,' he added.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Power row may delay coal sell-off
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A ROW between the gov-ernment, the electricity regulator, and the 12
regional electricity companies of England and Wales has emerged as a
potential obstacle to the privatisation of British Coal.
National Power and PowerGen, the electricity generators, will not sign
long-term supply contracts with British Coal unless they can first sell the
coal-fired power to the 12 regional electricity companies.
But the companies are refusing to sign contracts to buy coal-fired
electricity from the generators without approval from Offer, the regulator.
They are worried that if they sign at too high a price Offer will penalise
them for passing on the cost to consumers.
Offer says it will not intervene. The government has also refused to step
in.
The privatisation of British Coal cannot go ahead until the stand-off is
resolved. 'It's a vicious circle,' said the chairman of one of the regional
companies.
The government is anxious to make sure British Coal sells enough coal at a
price which will ensure its future, while avoiding the appearance of
subsidising the corporation.
The prices being offered to the companies by the generators for coal-fired
power is presently about 3p a unit, well above the price in the pool, or
wholesale, electricity market. At this price, the companies say, the
government would have to persuade them to sign a five-year contract and make
sure Offer approved this.
Offer said yesterday that the companies should simply make sure they buy
coal-fired power at competitive prices.
The regional companies are angry about the situation. 'It's all very well
for Offer to say it should be a commercial deal between us, the generators
and British Coal,' said the chairman of one, 'but we're being forced to do
something we would not normally do - sign a long-term contract at an unknown
price and volume that could put our business in jeopardy.'
Another chairman said the coal contracts could cost his company around
Pounds 1.2bn over five years. 'That would be the biggest commercial deal we
do,' he said. 'If Stephen Littlechild (the electricity regulator) comes
along in a year and says we signed at too high a price, it could have
disastrous financial consequences.'

THE EXPECTED post-election upturn in the badly depressed UK new-car market
has not materialised, Mr Ian McAllister, chairman of Ford of Britain, said
yesterday.
He said that even the cut in special car tax from 10 per cent to 5 per cent
had not helped restore confidence, particularly among private buyers. In the
first five months of the year sales to private individuals were running more
than 10 per cent below year-ago levels.
Unless there was a marked recovery in August - when the new registration
prefix, which normally accounts for more than 20 per cent of annual sales,
is introduced - this year's market could be smaller even than last year's
1.59m units, Mr McAllister said.
He was speaking as Ford launched an 'Options' scheme, under which private
buyers can acquire a new car by paying for its projected depreciation over
two years, plus interest charges. Ford guarantees a minimum value for the
car after two years - after which the 'owner' can choose to sell the car and
keep any extra above the agreed minimum value, return the car to Ford, or
keep it by paying the balance of the purchase price.
The Options programme was launched with an insurance scheme for 'hot
hatchbacks' such as the Fiesta XR2 and Escort XR3i, which in the past have
accounted for up to 15 per cent of Escort and Fiesta sales.
Soaring insurance premiums as a result of 'joyriding' and high accident
rates have sent UK sales of 'hot hatchbacks' plunging by more than half this
year. Ford hopes a panel of insurers it has set up will reduce premiums by
between 25 per cent and 30 per cent - about Pounds 250 a year.
Ford's initiatives are against the backdrop of one of the sharpest sales
declines in the industry's history. Last year they were down more than 30
per cent from the record 2.3m units achieved in 1989.
For the moment Ford is sticking to its forecast that sales will recover in
the second half to reach 1.65m. This will depend on August's sales achieving
Ford's current forecast of 400,000 - up from 360,000 last year.
Even then, they will have to pick up sharply, to an annualised rate of 1.74m
throughout the rest of this year for even the 1.65m to be achieved.
Ford is locked in a neck-and-neck struggle with Vauxhall for leadership of
the UK new-car market. Statistics due tomorrow will show whether Vauxhall
became the top selling UK brand in May for the first time.
Britain is poised to benefit from a 'sustained but fairly slow recovery',
Sir Michael Angus, the newly-elected president of the Confederation of
British Industry, said last night, Michael Cassell writes.
Sir Michael said in Birmingham that there were grounds for cautious optimism
about economic revival, although he warned that inflation was not yet
defeated and dismissed suggestions that the government should help
kick-start the economy.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Dentists' NHS fees to be cut by 7%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DENTISTS' fees are to be cut by 7 per cent as part of a government package
to bring their income closer to review body recommendations, Alan Pike
writes.
The British Dental Association warned last night that up to 40 per cent of
dentists would turn away National Health Service patients as a result of the
decision. Dentists' representatives will this weekend consider holding a
ballot on whether to refuse NHS treatment to some patients.
The government is imposing the reduction in fees and other restrictions
because it says dentists' income is exceeding the intentions of the review
body.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Mortgage rescue measures take effect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of house repossessions is expected to fall sharply this year as a
result of lenders' initiatives introduced six months ago, but the suspension
on stamp duty will not be extended, the government said yesterday.
At a meeting with representatives of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said he was encouraged by the progress in
cutting house repossessions.
After the meeting - called to review the housing rescue scheme set up to try
to ease the problem of repossessions - Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of
the council, said the underlying position on rents and arrears had not
improved.
'However, lenders are confident that the measures they have taken, in
particular greater counselling of borrowers and restructuring of loan
arrangements, will lead to a significant reduction in possessions compared
with the peak figures recorded in the middle of last year,' he said.
The chancellor rejected building society calls to extend the suspension of
stamp duty on most house purchases, due to expire on August 19.
Under the initiatives, the building societies pledged more than Pounds 800m
for mortgage-rescue schemes, intended to save at least 16,000 borrowers from
eviction.
During the meeting the council told Mr Lamont that, on previous trends, the
number of repossessions would have risen by 120,000 this year, but the
combination of lenders' initiatives and the direct payment of DSS benefits
to the lenders would reduce the number to about 65,000.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE eve of critical US-Japan semiconductor trade talks, Micron
Technology, a US memory chip maker, and NEC, Japan's biggest semiconductor
producer, have reached preliminary agreement to sell each other's memory
chip products.
Micron and NEC said they had signed a memorandum of understanding to allow
each company to resell the other's memory products under their own brand
names worldwide. The companies said they believed their accord would
'contribute to solving US-Japan semiconductor trade issues'. Amid rising
tensions over chip trade, US and Japanese industry executives begin meetings
in Tokyo today, with government-to-government talks due later this week.
The US accuses Japan of failing to meet obligations under a 1991 trade pact
to open its semiconductor market to foreign suppliers. Mrs Carla Hills, US
trade representative, has announced a review of how the chip pact is being
implemented.
The 1991 agreement says Japan recognises US expectations that the foreign
market share will rise to 'more than 20 per cent of the Japanese market by
the end of 1992', and specifies 'particular attention should be given to
market share' in gauging progress to an open market in Japan.
But with the foreign share of the Japanese market standing at 14.4 per cent,
there seems little chance Japan can reach the 20 per cent goal by the end of
the year. The talks in Tokyo this week are aimed at averting an escalation
of the trade row, which could lead to the US imposing retaliatory sanctions
on Japan. US industry executives hope Japan will outline plans to open its
market.
Details of the NEC-Micron pact have to be worked out, but the companies said
they intended to go beyond memory chip sales to 'other chip products and
other possible co-operation'.
Mr Joseph Parkinson, Micron chief executive, is chairman of the US
Semiconductor Industry Association, the group leading the US industry's
trade battle and jointly hosting this week's meeting with the Electronic
Industries Association of Japan. Recently, he accused Japanese and Korean
memory chip makers of dumping products in the US. Micron filed a suit
against the Koreans, but has made no formal charges against the Japanese.

THE Mexican government has initiated anti-dumping cases against flat-rolled
steel producers in the US, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City. Mexico
would be able to impose countervailing duties on all US flat steel producers
if the claims are upheld.
Its two flat steel producers, Hysla and Altos Hornos, brought the case
against USX, National, LTV and Bethlehem, and two US trading companies. They
claim the US companies have been selling hot-rolled, cold-rolled and
plate-in-coil steel below cost, making it impossible for the Mexicans to
compete fairly.
Mexico, unlike the US, has been unwilling until now to use its anti-dumping
laws.

China
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT George Bush announced last night he would seek extension of Most
Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status for China in spite of mounting
criticism in the US of Beijing's human rights record.
The president was obliged by law to act no later than today. Congress now
has 90 days in which to block implementation of MFN status, which allows a
wide range of Chinese goods to be imported under special preferences.
A White House statement issued yesterday evening acknowledged that the
decision would be controversial, as it was with the last extension a year
ago.
The US, the statement said, wanted to elicit a faster pace and a broader
scope for human rights improvements in China. Withdrawal of MFN would
achieve neither of these objectives.
Mr Bush has frequently been criticised for his staunch support of the
Chinese regime, especially after the Tiananmen Square massacres three years
ago. Further aggravations to bilateral relations have stemmed from Chinese
missile sales and nuclear testing, the most recent only last month.

FT  03 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Chile grows weary of US 'stalling antics'
on FTA - Leslie Crawford reports on the belief that President Bush is losing
a chance to forge a new relationship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEARY look of resignation descends upon Mr Alejandro Foxley, the Chilean
finance minister, when asked about Chile's chances of clinching a Free Trade
Agreement (FTA) with the US.
Mr Foxley has just returned from a gruelling week-long trip across the US,
where he and President Patricio Aylwin tried to drum up support for the
elimination of trade barriers between Chile and its biggest trading partner.
But instead of winning a firm commitment from President Bush to launch
negotiations, the Chileans were asked to wait patiently on the sidelines
until a similar, and far more complex, agreement was concluded with Mexico
and Canada.
Only then will Mr Bush (and then only if he survives the November
presidential elections) ask Congress for an extension of 'fast-track'
authority in order to conduct talks with Chile. 'We understand the political
constraints on Mr Bush during an election year,' Mr Foxley concedes, 'but we
are also impatient to see concrete results from the US president's
Enterprise for the Americas Initiative.'
Mr Bush's vision of a free trade bloc spanning the Americas met an
enthusiastic response in Chile when it was first mooted two years ago. When
Mr Bush visited Santiago in December 1990, he flattered his hosts into
believing that Chile would be the first country in South America to sign an
FTA in Washington. But after 18 months of no progress, officials in Santiago
have ceased to regard an FTA as their top foreign policy goal.
Mr Foxley believes that Washington is losing an opportunity to forge a new
relationship with Latin America based on economic partnership rather than
military or political domination. He says middle-income countries like Chile
are experiencing 'trade negotiation fatigue' after making huge unilateral
efforts to open up their economies and liberalise trade.
'We are frankly bored with the stalling antics of the US and European
Community at the Uruguay Round of multilateral trade talks,' he says. He
believes that developing countries will become increasingly sceptical of the
free-market prescriptions handed down by the industrialised world while it
continues to spend Dollars 250bn on agricultural protection.
This criticism was echoed at a meeting of EC and Latin American foreign
ministers in Santiago last week. While European diplomats were lush with
praise for Latin America's economic reforms, Mr Aylwin delivered a harsh
rebuke: 'We face a great paradox. 'On one side, Latin America is opening up
to international trade at a great social cost. On the other, industrialised
nations, including the EC, shelter behind protectionist measures that hamper
our growth and development.'
Access to foreign markets has become much more important to Chile than aid,
soft loans or debt relief. Its Dollars 9bn of exports last year accounted
for about 30 per cent of gross domestic product (GDP). Mr Foxley wants to
lead Chile into a second phase of export-led development, in which
manufactured goods take precedence over traditional exports such as copper,
fishmeal and fresh fruit. That is why, despite all the frustrations, Chilean
officials have not given up hope of clinching an agreement with the US. They
see the accord spurring a new wave of investment in export industries, as an
FTA would provide long-term stability in the rules of access to the US. It
would also be Chile's insurance policy against arbitrary protectionist
measures.
Mr Foxley says an FTA would act as a magnet for foreign investment. He has
been fielding inquiries lately from European companies interested in using
Chile as a launch pad into the US. Nobody in Washington believes a free
trade deal with Chile would threaten US jobs. Two-way trade, which totalled
Dollars 3.2bn last year, is evenly balanced. The asymmetry lies in the
relative importance of this trade: the US buys 18 per cent of Chile's
exports, but Chile buys less than 0.5 per cent of those of the US. The
obstacle Chile faces in Washington is not protectionism, but indifference.
An FTA with Chile would let Washington signal to the rest of Latin America
that it supports democratic regimes with open economies. Recent events in
Peru and Venezuela show how tenuous is democracy in the region. Chile is not
holding its breath for free trade to materialise with the US. The fastest
growing market for its exports is now the Far East. Japan, for the first
time last year, edged out the US as the main buyer of Chilean goods.

FT  03 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Ex-Soviet states invited to join new Cocom
body
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COCOM, the multilateral organisation which for years controlled the sale of
western high technology to communist countries, has invited the former
Soviet republics to join a new export control body. The group will not
replace Cocom, which will continue to control some exports because of fears
they could be re-exported to regimes Cocom perceives as dangerous or
unstable.
On Monday, Cocom, the 17-member Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral
Export Controls, agreed to a proposal by Mr James Baker, US secretary of
state, that the republics be asked to join a new entity, the Cocom
Co-operation Forum on Export Controls. The US agreed to a German demand to
ease export curbs on telecommunications. Reportedly, this concession
includes easing of controls on fibre optics, which the Bush administration
has been resisting.
Announcing the agreement yesterday, the State Department embraced the German
proposal as its own. A State Department spokesman said President Bush had
been urging Cocom to become 'reflective of today's environment. As the
emerging democracies seek to reform and establish closer ties to the west,
better telephone, fax and other data networks are clearly needed'.
The new forum would provide significantly wider access to advanced western
goods and technology to the former Soviet Union; set out procedures to
ensure against diversion to unauthorised users, and help the new states
develop their own systems of export controls. Curbs will remain on some
republics for munitions, high-speed computers and advanced machine tools.
The forum will meet soon to further define its agenda.
With concern in the US shifting to curbing weapons and high technology for
what it sees as unstable or 'outlaw' states, the setting-up of export
control systems in the republics assumes new urgency. Export control experts
say the corruption sweeping the former Soviet Union as its economic system
collapses could mean leakages of weapons and technology to dangerous users.

AN INTERNATIONAL consortium including Amec of the UK and the mainland
Chinese-controlled China Fujian Corporation has won a Pounds 260m road
contract as part of Hong Kong's HKDollars 114bn (Pounds 8bn) new airport
project.
The award of previous contracts for the airport has prompted criticism that
the project is being used as a final 'pay-day' for UK companies before the
colony is handed over to Chinese rule in in 1997. Mr Alan Cockshaw, Amec
chairman, said yesterday the consortium had received no special treatment.
'Competition for the road contract was intense. As we understand it, ours
was the lowest price but only by a short head.'
Other members of the winning consortium included Downer of New Zealand,
Eltin of Australia, International Water &amp; Electric Corporation and Universal
Dockyard, both of Hong Kong.
The contract for work on the 6.5km Tai Ho section of the North Lantau
Expressway, forming part of the road-rail system to link the Lantau Island
airport with Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, is due to be completed in 1996.
The consortium is also bidding for the remaining 7km section of the North
Lantau Expressway which will carry a six-lane highway, as well as provision
for an airport railway and a service road.

   ATLANTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Atlanta judge presiding over the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) Iraqi
loans case called yesterday for the appointment of a special prosecutor and
pressed repeatedly for full disclosure of any possible government
involvement in the affair.
Judge Marvin Shoob's call came after US prosecutors announced a surprise
plea bargain with Mr Christopher Drogoul, the former BNL branch manager in
Atlanta accused of making more than Dollars 5.5bn of secret loans to Iraq.
Mr Drogoul, who had informed the judge previously that he planned to plead
guilty to a 347-count indictment on conspiracy and fraud charges, yesterday
changed his mind. He pleaded guilty to only 60 of the charges, decided to
co-operate with the government and said he would delay his promise to name
names.
An angry Judge Shoob told the court Mr Drogoul was 'not making a full and
honest disclosure. This case ought to have a special prosecutor because I'm
not getting the information. I'm going to get a sanitised version.'
The judge's remarks came as the House judiciary committee in Washington
began hearings to determine whether to seek the appointment of a special
prosecutor to investigate the BNL affair and the administration's dealings
with Iraq.
Judge Shoob asked Mr Drogoul if it was true that he had never expected to
come to trial 'because there are so many substantial people involved'. Mr
Drogoul replied it was true.
The former BNL branch manager said he did not have 'formal discussions with
Washington officials' about the loans to Iraq, but said the matter was a
complicated one and he wished to review documents before disclosing the
names of those outside BNL who were involved. During the hearing Judge Shoob
said: 'I don't believe for a minute that you were able to do all of this on
your own.' Mr Drogoul replied: 'You're right.'
Judge Shoob, saying he would not accept anything being 'sealed, stonewalled
or suppressed', warned both Mr Drogoul and government prosecutors that 'when
it comes time for sentencing, if I get a sanitised version Mr Drogoul is
never going to get out of jail'.
At the sentencing hearing, set for August 13, Mr Drogoul will receive a
prison term related to the 60 charges to which he pleaded guilty. Government
prosecutors, who yesterday pledged to follow up leads provided by Mr
Drogoul, are expected to recommend a reduced sentence.
After the hearing Ms Gerrilyn Brill, the senior prosecutor on the BNL case,
challenged the judge's assertion 'that our version of the facts was
sanitised' and said she saw no need for a special prosecutor.
Ms Brill disclosed that before the BNL indictments were brought last year
the US had considered prosecuting the central bank of Iraq over the affair.
However, a decision not to prosecute had been taken by Mr Robert Mueller, an
official of the Justice Department.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Brazil puts cost of conference at Dollars 37m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL IS footing the bill for what promises to be the biggest party on
earth. Mr Flavio Perri, the conference organiser, estimates the total cost
to the government at Cr105bn (Dollars 37m) - a drain on a bankrupt Treasury
and a country where even the presidency no longer serves coffee.
The Brazilians have even had to bear the travel expenses of some of their
guests and have so far paid out more than Dollars 2m for UN officials.
Mr Marcos Azambuja, Brazil's main negotiator, believes the money has been
well spent. He sees the Earth Summit as a chance to improve the country's
poor image in terms of environment and security. He also hopes it will put
Rio de Janeiro back on the map as a key tourist destination and a future
international conference centre.
But he says Brazil's parlous economic situation means that organisation has
had to be done on the cheap. 'Like anyone inviting friends to dinner, we'd
like to offer more to impress.'
In fact, just three months before the conference, the budget was halved.
The main outlay was on extending Rio's communications network and improving
security. The conference centre, which had been used only for exhibitions
and rock concerts, had to be renovated. Translation services have been
installed and an enormous round table for heads of state built. So stretched
was the Brazilian purse that its own delegation is housed in a
pre-fabricated unit with no roof.
Brazil has accepted donations from the private sector: 285 cars from
Volkswagen and 10 buses from Scania. The federal police chipped in, lending
300 cars.
The real cost has lain with Rio state which has been hard at work
resurfacing roads, restoring parks and installing streetlighting.
Mr Roberto D'Avila, the state environment secretary, estimates that the
state has spent Dollars 500m but he says this was for already-needed
investments.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE official index of leading indicators rose for the fourth consecutive
month in April, providing further evidence that the US economic recovery is
likely to be sustained through the summer, the Commerce Department said
yesterday.
However, optimism was tempered by weaker than expected figures for new homes
sales.
The index of leading indicators rose 0.4 per cent in April. Revised figures
for March showed an increase of 0.4 per cent, rather than 0.2 per cent as
first reported. The indicators are designed to provide advance warning of
changes in the pace of economic activity.
A separate index of coincident indicators - measuring the economy's current
state - was unchanged in April, confirming a temporary loss of momentum in
late spring.
The rise in the leading index was led by increases in commodity prices,
reduced claims for state unemployment insurance, stronger orders for
consumer goods and a rise in consumer confidence.
However, five of the components of the index, including the real money
supply, provided negative contributions in April.
Sales of new single-family homes rose 1.3 per cent in the month, to a
seasonally-adjusted annual rate of 530,000. Financial markets, however, were
expecting an increase of more than 5 per cent.
Figures for March were revised down to show a drop of 15.9 per cent relative
to February, rather than a drop of 14.8 per cent as initially reported.
The weak home sales figures follow other evidence that the housing sector
has cooled after contributing strongly to growth in the first quarter.

<TEXT>
THE EARTH Summit starts in Rio de Janeiro today amid signs that the toughest
negotiations will be about money, rather than the environment.
As delegations from 178 countries and a press corps of 7,000 assembled, the
organisers and developing countries issued passionate pleas for generosity
by the rich to help the world clean up the environment. But the
industrialised countries embark on the two-week conference with a tight hold
on their wallets.
Mr Maurice Strong, the conference secretary-general, said: 'Finance is the
key issue - a tough issue. Not many nations, even the rich, are feeling rich
and generous. But we need a reorientation of our priorities.
'We're talking not just about more foreign aid. The best environmental
investment that can be made is in the third world. No one expects this
commitment to come all at once. But we want the important first steps.'
Money lies at the heart of all the most important documents on the Rio
negotiating table: two treaties to clean up the atmosphere and protect
living species, and a 450-page action programme.
Mr Joe Wheeler, the UN official overseeing the financial negotiations, said:
'They will be very difficult. They will go on late into the night. A lot is
at stake.'
But the industrial countries are making clear that there will be few if any
pledges of money in Rio, though they recognise that many of the demands for
money are genuine and that rich countries have a responsibility to finance
sustainable growth in the developing world.
Late on Monday, Germany convened a meeting of officials from the Group of
Seven industrial nations to try to co-ordinate their positions.
Yesterday the G7 extended these contacts to other Organisation of Economic
Co-operation and Development countries in advance of formal negotiations.
Dr Ansgar Vogel, director general of the German Environment Ministry, said
it was 'a question of morality' that industrial countries should help third
world countries. 'Industrial countries have to give a clear signal that they
consider themselves in a position of responsibility.' Other G7 countries
took a more cautious line. Many of them fear that whatever sums they mention
will be criticised as inadequate, and will anyway fall far short of the
Dollars 125bn (Pounds 69bn) a year which the summit organisers say is
needed.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Fujimori's promise leaves many questions: Sceptics, home in
ona lack of detail
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN LINE with his commitment to the meeting in the Bahamas of the
Organisation of American States (OAS) two weeks ago, Peruvian President
Alberto Fujimori has announced elections for October 18.
The Peruvian people are to elect an 80-strong, one-chamber congress. This
would draft a new constitution to be submitted to the people in a
referendum, Mr Fujimori said.
His Monday night televised announcement was inexplicably delayed for 24
hours but still came as a relief to foreign observers accustomed to abrupt
presidential retreats from apparently cast-iron commitments.
While Mr Fujimori gave no details of the election mechanisms by which the
congressmen would be chosen, he has invited OAS and other international
observers to scrutinise and even advise on the electoral process.
Many other questions also remain unanswered. The government has promised a
new law to 'democratise' the internal functioning of Peru's political
parties and to eliminate the practice of electing candidates by lists, but
Mr Fujimori evaded the issue in his address. Neither did he mention the
legislative and watchdog powers he had earlier proposed.
Politicians were enraged by the condition that anyone elected to the
constituent congress will be disbarred from standing for parliament for 10
years. They say this is for the congress itself to determine.
One senior western diplomat said that the moves were 'almost entirely the
result of external economic pressures. Mr Fujimori realised, albeit late in
the day, that everything he'd worked for during his term of office was about
to collapse with the suspension of international aid.'
The definitive turn of the international screw was provided by Japan, Peru's
chief economic lifeline. The Japanese government had initially expressed
'understanding' of Mr Fujimori's April 5 suspension of the constitution on
the grounds that parliament and the courts were blocking economic
modernisation and his counter-subversive and drugs-trafficking offensives.
But Tokyo, just days before the OAS decision on economic sanctions against
Peru, spelled out that, without a swift return to democracy, Japan would
also cut off assistance.
That Mr Fujimori managed to cobble together a last-ditch, face-saving
proposal for the OAS was largely due to Mr Hernando de Soto, the think-tank
chief who, until early this year, was Mr Fujimori's chief adviser on drugs
and international relations.
Mr de Soto has for years been promoting a project for 'democratising the
government decision-making process'. That project provided the intellectual
meat for Mr Fujimori's Bahamas proposal. If Mr Fujimori were to follow the
de Soto proposals to the letter, then Peru would indeed have democracy.
However, Mr Diego Garcia Sayan, president of the Andean Commission of
Jurists, is one of many sceptics. 'Mr Fujimori's discourse lacks coherence,'
he says. 'It is totally ingenuous to believe that a basically authoritarian
president and a de facto regime that rely on the tactics of improvisation
and surprise can install a real democracy.'
In one advance, Mr Fujimori has reinstated the 1979 constitution pending
approval of the new one, 'except for those articles which impede the
progress of this government'. But jurists and human rights organisations
remain alarmed that penalties for those involved in the 'disappearances' of
alleged terrorists have been erased from the statute books.
The April 5 measures appear to have done little to curb subversive activity,
and much of Mr Fujimori's support is founded on the hopes that his hard-line
approach to fighting subversion will work. Economic stabilisation and future
growth hinge on the defeat of terrorism, which has cost the state an
estimated Dollars 20bn (Pounds 11.1bn) in 12 months, about the same as
Peru's foreign debt.
With international economic assistance suspended since democracy was
overthrown, the already precarious balance of payments position has been
further exacerbated. A Dollars 2bn reserves war-chest will cushion the
economy for this year, but sweeping debt rescheduling, particularly with
Peru's Paris Club creditors, will be essential by the end of the year. And a
clean return to democracy will be a pre-condition.
Mr Fujimori is reiterating his commitment to turning Peru into a
fully-fledged market economy, 'a country for business' he called it on
Monday night.
He is promising 'definitive stabilisation and the integral reinsertion of
Peru in the world system'. Wherever possible, he says, this process will be
speeded up.
Announcements by Peru's economy minister and privatisation chief in New York
last week indicate that the government will now countenance use of debt
instruments in the long-delayed privatisation process.
Tight domestic liquidity meant that, for local entrepreneurs, the rounding
up of a modest Dollars 1.3m last week to buy the first state-owned mine was
a major feat. The government knows it will need to provide special
incentives to attract purchasers for the public sector giants now in the
privatisation pipeline.
Mr Fujimori's announcement may be enough to appease the international
political community. But re-establishment of fledgling investor confidence
and the urgently needed inflow of private capital is likely to be a much
longer haul.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Bonn seeks big savings in state health costs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BONN, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE German government is planning to save DM11bn (Pounds 3.7bn) a year in
the state-subsidised health care system, at the expense of patients,
doctors, and the drug industry.
The state subsidy has risen from DM5.5bn in 1991 to Dm10bn in the current
year. The German drugs market is the world's third largest after the US and
Japan, worth about Pounds 6.4bn a year, according to Glaxo, the UK group.
Under the plan, patients will pay much more for medicines; pharmaceutical
prices will be cut by 5 per cent from next January - based on prices frozen
at the level of May 1, 1992; basic daily contributions for hospital care
will rise from DM10 to DM11; and the quantity of medicines doctors may
prescribe will be curbed.
Another proposal in the package, agreed by all three parties in the
government coalition yesterday, would limit the number of doctors eligible
to join state-funded health schemes.
The plan immediately ran into strong criticism from doctors and the
opposition Social Democrats. Mr Klaus Kirschner, the latters' health
spokesman, said patients were again being asked to pay for failed health
service reforms introduced in 1988.
He said the increased prescription charges (requiring patients to pay 10 per
cent of the cost of each medicine, from a minimum charge of DM3 to a maximum
DM10) was a 'flagrant breach of faith' by the coalition partners.
Most pharmaceuticals companies said they were waiting for full details of
the proposals to be published. They expect a reference pricing system for
asthma and ulcer drugs to be introduced imminently. The scheme would fix
drug prices, and if companies want to charge more, the difference would be
paid by the patient. Astra of Sweden and Glaxo of the UK are most likely to
be affected.
The pharmaceutical companies are being asked to contribute a 'solidarity
payment' by accepting the 5 per cent price cut until the end of 1994.
The total package is intended to save DM8bn on the side of the
pharmaceutical industry, the doctors and hospitals, with a DM3bn
contribution from patients in the form of increased payments. Charges will
be lower in east Germany than in the wealthy west.

<TEXT>
HOPES of implementing any ceasefire in Bosnia-Hercegovina collapsed
yesterday after an aid worker with a humanitarian relief convoy was killed
in an attack by Serb militia on the outskirts of the capital Sarajevo, and
fighting spread to other parts of the republic.
Shortly after the attack Yugoslavia's collective leadership in Belgrade
called on Serb leaders in Bosnia to 'immediately halt all bombardments of
Sarajevo. . . and to cede the city airport to the control of the United
Nations'.
The statement, initialled by Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic, was the
strongest criticism yet of Serb irregular forces in two months of fighting
in Bosnia. Diplomats said the communique appeared to indicate that leaders
from Serbia and Montenegro were trying to distance themselves from Bosnia's
Serb leaders and militia groups following UN sanctions.
The relief convoy, organised by the Children's Embassy, an international
charity, and escorted by two UN armoured personnel carriers, had attempted
to take food to Dobrinja, a suburb of Sarajevo. Over 20,000 people have been
under siege by Serbian militia for 40 days.
Ms Sanja Rihtman from the Children's Embassy in Sarajevo said one aid worker
was shot dead and another badly injured in the attack.
Despite the incident Mr John Thornbury, a UN special envoy, yesterday flew
by helicopter to Sarajevo in an attempt to start negotiations on reopening
the airport.
Meanwhile Sarajevo radio, quoting the Bosnian government, said 5,700 people
had died, and more than 20,000 had been injured since fighting in the
republic began two months ago. About 1.5m people had been displaced.
Sarajevo Radio said there was no let-up in fighting yesterday. It said
Serbian militia forces and the Yugoslav army bombarded Jajce, a city in
north-east Bosnia, where Croats and Moslems make up 70 per cent of the
population.
A western diplomat said it was 'unclear' if the Yugoslav presidency's call
would reduce the level of violence in Bosnia or if the Serb militia groups
were beyond Belgrade's control. UN officials say General Ratko Mladic,
commander of the Bosnian Serb army, is ordering the attacks.
Gen Zivota Panic, commander of the Yugoslav army, was due to hold talks with
Bosnian President Alija Izetbegovic in Sarajevo. However, it is unclear if
General Panic can control General Mladic's forces.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's biggest bank and one of Europe's most powerful
financial institutions, has been accused of operating a domestic cartel with
public sector savings institutions to keep interest rates low on the most
popular form of savings accounts.
The German federal cartel office makes the charge in a letter to Mr Hilmar
Kopper, the bank's chief executive, sent after he remarked at a
shareholders' meeting that if the public sector savings banks raised their
interest rates, the bank would follow suit 'within 24 hours'.
The cartel authorities have asked Mr Kopper to explain, suggesting that his
reluctance to raise rates first is evidence of a lack of competition at the
less sophisticated end of the savings market. The inquiry relates to a
special type of account with interest rates of 2.5-3 per cent - lower than
inflation and half as much as can be obtained on more sophisticated
products. Despite the low rates, these basic savings accounts are the most
popular form of savings vehicle in Germany and deposits are thought to total
DM500bn (Pounds 170bn).
'We are basically concerned that interest rates on these accounts are too
low,' the cartel office said yesterday.
Deutsche Bank said yesterday it denied the charges.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN yesterday came out firmly in support of a Nato peace-keeping role
outside the area traditionally covered by the Atlantic alliance.
Mr Douglas Hurd, the British foreign secretary, speaking in London before a
Nato ministerial meeting in Oslo later this week, said that Nato must make
its resources available 'when the international community has decided that
action needs to be taken'.
Though he stressed that Nato should not itself become a 'pan-European
policeman', it should be prepared to act under the authority of the United
Nations or the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe.
The advantage of this was that it would include the US, without expecting it
to act alone. 'It would be frivolous and dangerous to start separating the
US and Canada from the security of Europe.'
Mr Hurd stressed that Britain was not opposed to the recently-created
Franco-German corps, as long as it was used under a Nato or Western European
Union defence organisation hat.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Peugeot chief's drive for political office: Tough right-wing
businessman sets his sights on capturing French presidency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PEUGEOT'S chairman, Mr Jacques Calvet, who said at the weekend he would like
to run for French president in 1994, is the latest businessman to bid for
high office.
Like Ross Perot, the Texan billionaire aiming for the White House, Mr Calvet
is right wing. But there the similarity ends. Mr Calvet, 61, is not a brash
outsider with poorly formed policies, but a calculating and well-informed
senior member of the French political and business elite.
Mr Calvet's political ambitions are no surprise. 'I am ready to put forward
my candidacy. . . . even if I have one chance in a thousand of carrying it
off,' he told guests at the French Open tennis tournament. He has often been
tipped for ministerial office and can hardly open his mouth without
attacking the Socialists, the Japanese or the European Commission, to the
despair of Peugeot executives who wish he would apply more of his powerful
brain to selling cars.
This time, Mr Calvet has raised the stakes, in what looks like a sensible
bet that voters will support someone who shares rising general anxiety about
loss of French sovereignty in the wake of the Maastricht treaty on monetary
and political union. He could also be betting that voters are tired of the
same old figures on the right: the equivocal Mr Jacques Chirac, leader of
the RPR Gaullist party, and former President Valery Giscard d'Estaing, the
remote Sphinx-like head of the centre-right UDF.
Mr Calvet's articulate attacks on European federalism and the shortcomings
of the Maastricht treaty place him in line with a large rebel group in the
RPR. Yet he is well out of line with the pro-European Mr Giscard d'Estaing,
who happens to be his former political boss.
If Mr Calvet really does follow his ambitions, he could find himself
standing against Mr Giscard d'Estaing in a joint UDF and RPR primary. The
Socialist candidate in the 1995 presidential election is likely to be either
Mr Jacques Delors, the Commission president - that would be a delicious
confrontation - or the equally pro-European former premier, Mr Michel
Rocard.
Even if Mr Calvet turns out to be bluffing, his declaration could well put
pressure on the right to fight harder against the Maastricht treaty, still
being ratified in France.
Mr Calvet has shown startling adaptability in his career. Educated at the
Ecole Nationale d'Administration, the gilt-edged civil service college, he
was head of Mr Giscard d'Estaing's private office when the latter was
finance minister from 1970 to 1974. Later, Mr Calvet joined Banque Nationale
de Paris, the largest state-owned bank, to become chairman only to be thrown
out when the Socialists came to power in 1981.
The Peugeot family asked him to help out at the car group a year later,
because it needed a strong manager who could turn round the near bankrupt
company and fight off union attempts to have Peugeot nationalised.
Mr Calvet did both with panache, confronting the new Socialist government
head-on with a heavy programme of Peugeot job cuts, at one point provoking
riots outside a plant near Paris. The Peugeot family made him chairman in
1984 and it is as a result of Mr Calvet's toughness that the group's
published net margins are now the best in the world car industry.
A handful of successors is now in place at Peugeot. He once said that 'one
should not stay for much longer than 10 years in a job,' which would bring
him neatly to 1994, a year before the elections.

sounds treaty's death knell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JUBILANT Euro-sceptics at Westminster last night welcomed the Danish
rejection of the Maastricht treaty, which will ensure chaotic scenes if
legislation to enact the agreement comes before MPs today, as scheduled.
The result could scarcely have come at a more embarrassing time for the UK
government, both in terms of discussion of UK legislation and for the
British presidency of the Community, which begins at the start of next
month.
Pressure was growing among politicians last night for debate of the bill to
be postponed, with some MPs claiming the treaty was already 'dead'.
Mr John Major, the prime minister, is to discuss implications of the result
with Mr Douglas Hurd, foreign secretary, today. The government is almost
certain to make a statement to the House of Commons this afternoon.
Last night Downing Street would say only that Mr Major was being kept
informed of developments and was assessing the result. Government officials
said they had not yet heard what the Danish administration intended to do.
Whatever its course, it is bound to make the UK presidency more complicated.
While Downing Street emphasised that there was no reason not to press ahead
with UK legislation, and re-emphasised that the UK had got 'a good deal'
from the Maastricht summit, Mr Peter Shore, a former Labour cabinet minister
and a leading Euro-sceptic, said the news meant the bill could not continue.
Rebel backbench MPs on both sides of the House described the referendum as
'wonderful' and 'delightful'. Sir Teddy Taylor, Tory MP for Southend east
and secretary of the dissident Tory European Reform Group, said the result
was 'glorious news for democracy'.
Euro-sceptics had already proposed amendments to the Maastricht bill to
ensure a referendum in the UK before legislation could come into effect. The
Danish result will increase both pressure for such a referendum and
reluctance of government to countenance one. Ministers rejected the idea
during the last parliament, when Mrs Margaret Thatcher was one high-profile
supporter.

sidelines of Community
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK'S narrow rejection of the treaty will have serious consequences for
its membership of the European Community.
By turning their backs on the planned evolution of the EC Danes have
isolated their country from the mainstream of European development. As a
result Denmark will have no influence on the future of the Community but
will have to abide by decisions taken by the other members.
The voters have dealt an unexpected body blow to their political leaders.
Only a few weeks ago the Folketing (parliament) voted 130-25 to ratify the
treaty.
'There are 130 members of the Folketing who must now sit down and think how
it is that they have distanced themselves so far from their voters,' said Mr
Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister.
But it was not just the politicians who supported Maastricht. The main
industrial organisations, trade unions and the powerful agricultural lobby
all threw their weight behind the 'Yes to Maastricht' campaign, and there
was near-universal support for the treaty in the press.
Only two parties, the left-wing Socialist People's party and the populist
right-wing Progress party, were against the treaty, but they were supported
by an exotic coalition of environmentalists, feminists, left-wing academics
and ultra-nationalists. Despite a lack of resources, these groups touched a
nerve in the population.
Although Denmark joined the EC 20 years ago after a referendum which
approved membership by two to one, and in 1986 backed the Single European
Act by a comfortable majority, these votes were mainly out of economic
self-interest. When asked to vote for European union, a common foreign and
defence policy, and the rest of the Maastricht treaty, Danes drew back from
such a potentially far-reaching commitment.
Fears about national independence have been the overwhelming factor
influencing the No vote, opinion surveys showed. While many of the elderly,
with memories of the Second World War, feared German domination, many
younger voters, especially women, foresaw with distaste the development of a
European army in which their children might one day have to fight.
These emotional arguments turned out to be stronger than the appeal to
Danish material self-interest, despite a vigorous but belated campaign by
the Danish labour movement to persuade its supporters that a No vote would
mean more unemployment, falling investment and higher interest rates.
The country now faces a period of economic uncertainty, which could threaten
its economic stability at a time when the economy is one of the strongest in
Europe. In the worst case, Danish officials in Brussels have suggested,
Denmark could be excluded from the Common Agricultural Policy, which has
brought big economic benefits to Denmark, a big exporter of agricultural
products to non-member countries.
The consequences are likely to be serious for the rest of the Nordic region.
In Sweden, public opinion is now evenly divided over the country's
membership application and the narrow result in Denmark will encourage the
anti-EC forces. In Finland, opinion appears to be more solid for the
country's EC membership application, but this could also begin to change
now, while in Norway, a majority is already hostile to any membership
application.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Danes say no to Maastricht Treaty: EC's big players likely
to get on with game - The dismay in Brussels is total, but the goals of
Maastricht will be pursued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DECISION of Danish voters in effect to kill the European Community's
historic treaty on political and monetary union was greeted with complete
dismay in Brussels last night .
'There is an insurmountable legal requirement that if any one of the 12
member states does not ratify it, Maastricht goes down the drain,' said a
senior EC official. 'We have made no contingency planning for this
whatsoever, because to do so would have further invited what has happened
tonight.'
Brussels officials had counted on history repeating itself in Denmark, which
had shown itself initially hostile to the 1986 Single European Act but
eventually approved it in a referendum by a fairly comfortable majority.
They had also counted on the 80 per cent pro-Maastricht majority in the
Danish parliament carrying the populace. Equally, however, they had rather
discounted as constitutionally impossible hints from the Danish government
that it might call a second referendum if the first went against the treaty.
But it is clear that several important EC governments will not take the
rejection lying down, particularly as the margin of defeat is so small.
Maastricht's opponents may rejoice - among them, those Germans too wedded to
the D-Mark ever to give it up, the far left and right in France, those Irish
who saw their neutrality being lost in plans for a common foreign and
security policy, and quite a broad spectrum in Britain's two main political
parties who considered Community integration was going too far too fast.
However, President Francois Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl signalled
at their meeting last week that they would pursue the goals of Maastricht,
no matter what the vicissitudes of ratification. If they choose to try to
call another exhausting intergovernmental conference (IGC) to negotiate 'Son
of Maastricht', then they are sure to be supported by the three Benelux
countries, Italy, and probably Spain and Portugal.
It only needs a simple majority - seven of the 12 states - to set another
constitutional revision rolling, although, as last night's Danish referendum
dramatically underlines, it needs all 12 not only to agree to the final
negotiating result but also to ratify it into law.
If another IGC is called soon, its chairmanship will, iron-ically, fall to
Britain, which takes over the presidency of the EC council of ministers on
July 1. Mr John Major's government, which had managed to reconcile its own
Conservative party to Maastricht by winning opt-out clauses for Britain on
monetary union and social policy, would then have to play a neutral role in
trying to reconcile differing versions of political and monetary union.
While it could perhaps count on most member states tempering their ambitions
in the wake of the Danish setback, particularly if there was still an
attempt to keep Denmark within the full Community club, Britain would be
ill-placed, as holder of the EC presidency, to argue its corner anything
like as vigorously as it did in the 1991 Maastricht negotiations.
Danish leaders, notably Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, and
Mr Miels Ersboll, the Dane who is secretary general of the council of
ministers in Brussels, had earlier warned their countrymen, and especially
countrywomen (who seemed to have formed the hard core of the No vote), that
rejection of the treaty would force Denmark to seek second-class status as
an associate of the 'European union' which was negotiated at Maastricht. EC
officials see no precedent for such a partial disengagement.
Any Danish rejection of Maastricht will be greeted with very mixed feelings
by the fellow Nordic countries of Sweden and Finland, as well as
Switzerland, which have all now lodged applications to join the Community.
While these three neutral countries may breathe a sigh of relief that they
might not have to subscribe to an eventual EC defence policy, they will also
fear that Maastricht's rejection will jeopardise their chances of starting
entry negotiations next year.
The reason is that almost all 12 member states, even Britain to some extent,
have regarded some 'deepening' of EC integration as a basic pre-condition to
taking in new member states, particularly neutral ones. Indeed, the Lisbon
summit at the end of this month had been likely to agree, on the basis of a
forthcoming Commission report, that some further deepening of integration
like the introduction of more majority voting - beyond that already agreed
at Maastricht - would eventually be essential for a larger Community to
function.
The main elements of the Maastricht treaty provide for:
A phased move to economic and monetary union (Emu), with a European central
bank managing a common currency by 1997, or 1999 at the latest. With less
publicity, but just as concretely, Denmark won an opt-out clause, allowing
it to put its participation in Emu to a further referendum in 1996.
A wider scope of business for the Community, with more say in EC law-making
given to the European parliament. The Danish government in fact welcomed
moves to more majority voting in the areas of social and environmental
policy. But the Danish parliament, the Folketing, which exercises a very
tight control over its own government's EC decisions, has always been
jealous of more powers going to MEPs in Strasbourg.
A commitment for the 'European union' to have a common foreign and security
policy, with some limited provision for majority voting which Denmark, along
with Britain, Ireland and Portugal, resisted.
An eventual common defence policy, to be organised through the Western
European Union. Nine EC states already belong to this, but not Denmark which
has wanted to preserve the Community's civilian image.
Thus, the breadth of Danish reservations about Maastricht - similar in
range, though not exactly in nature, to concerns that Britain had - make it
hard to renegotiate the treaty to please Danes, without the entire package
deal falling apart.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Maxwell probe urged by MPs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH, NORMA COHEN, RAYMOND SNODDY, JIMMY BURNS and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MPs yesterday called for an official investigation into revelations that a
web of private companies linked to the Maxwell family survives, apparently
beyond the reach of administrators, while pensioners face the loss of
benefits.
Pensioners expressed outrage at the disclosure in yesterday's Financial
Times that the companies, some controlled from the secretive tax haven of
Liechtenstein, were still trading and were apparently beyond the reach of
administrators and creditors of the Maxwell empire.
As the political controversy surrounding the looting of more than Pounds
400m from the late Mr Robert Maxwell's businesses looked set to erupt again,
Mr Kevin Maxwell, former chief executive of Maxwell Communication
Corporation was yesterday working in the London office of a
Liechtenstein-controlled company with links to the Maxwell family. The
listed four-storey building off Ludgate Hill in the City of London was
rented over a month ago on behalf of Sphere Inc, a California computer games
publisher which expects to have a turnover of Dollars 20m (Pounds 11m) this
year.
Mr Robert Maxwell, who died last November, bought an 80 per cent stake in
the company, a stake which is held by the Maxwell Charitable Trust in
Liechtenstein. Mr Kevin Maxwell refused to comment yesterday.
At the House of Commons, Mr Frank Field, Labour chairman of the cross-party
social security select committee in the last parliament, said the
revelations reinforced the case for re-establishing the committees, which
were dissolved before the election, as soon as possible.
Mr Field said: 'It's an incredible form of privatisation, that a public body
with the staff to look into these areas is dependent on the FT's doing it
for us.' He said the news also raised the question of what other companies
might be beyond the reach of creditors and the pensioners.
Mr David Shaw, Conservative MP and formerly a member of the social security
committee, said there should clearly be a 'full investigation by the Bank of
England, the government or parliament' into the relationship between the
UK-based Maxwell
businesses and those controlled in Liechtenstein.
Mr Shaw has put down a parliamentary question asking Mr Michael Heseltine,
president of the board of trade, to trace Maxwell pension monies and Maxwell
company assets to Liechtenstein and other countries outside the control of
the UK.
Mr Michael Meacher, the shadow social security secretary, pressed further
his call for a government statement on the plight of the Maxwell pensioners.
The government is expected to announce next week a review of pension law.
Mr Doug Bristow, a Maxwell pensions campaigner, said of the disclosures: 'I
am sickened and staggered that the Maxwell heirs can still get their hands
on huge amounts of money around the world, when the people who are really
owed it haven't got a hope in hell of seeing a penny of it.'
Roughly half of that scheme's 10,000 members face a 70 per cent cut in
benefits from next month, and others who are deferred pensioners risk losing
their entire pension benefits.
Mr Kenneth Trench, who heads the Maxwell Pensioners Action Group, said the
latest revelations underscore his group's argument that the government has
an obligation to compensate pensioners whose benefits have been slashed.
'Why weren't regulators as suspicious as we were?' Mr Trench said. 'All
we're going to do now is to go for compensation,' he added.
Fivetell, one of more than 270 companies in which Mr Kevin Maxwell holds
directorships, is being examined by investigators trying to find assets
outside the control of the administrators.
Documents at Companies House also reveal a company called Panlor, created
last December, six weeks after Mr Robert Maxwell's death.
The shareholders and beneficiaries are Laura and Pandora Maxwell, the wives
of Mr Kevin and Mr Ian Maxwell respectively, the two directors.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Danes say No to Maastricht: Narrow vote against treaty
blocks pact on European political and monetary union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR and HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DANISH VOTERS last night threw into confusion the future plans of the
European Community by rejecting the Maastricht Treaty and thereby blocking
the current EC accord on European political and monetary union.
The surprise result - by the narrowest of margins in a referendum - will
force the other 11 EC states to renegotiate the accord if, as seems likely,
a modified form of the treaty is to go ahead.
The painstakingly-negotiated treaty, requiring unanimous agreement, was
intended to become the EC's new constitution, replacing the 34-year-old
founding Treaty of Rome. It was to have led to a single currency by 1999,
the gradual building of a common foreign and security policy, and eventually
to a common defence policy.
Mr Joao de Deus Pinheiro, foreign minister of Portugal, current holder of
the EC presidency, expressed deep disappointment at the Danish vote, which
is binding on the Copenhagen government. EC foreign ministers will hold an
emergency meeting in Oslo tomorrow, on the sidelines of scheduled Nato
talks, to discuss the implications.
Mr Poul Schluter, Danish prime minister, said: 'I am convinced that the
other 11 members will carry out the Maastricht treaty, so it is up to us to
get as much out of the situation as possible.'
In London, the vote was being assessed by Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Downing Street pointed out that the UK government had yet to hear officially
what the Danish administration planned to do. The outcome of the referendum
was welcomed by vocal critics at Westminster of the Maastricht accord.
Mr Major and Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign secretary, will today discuss the
matter, which could have a significant impact on the UK presidency of the
Community, which starts at the beginning of next month.
The Danish vote also throws into doubt the aim of Irish prime minister
Albert Reynolds for a strong Yes vote in his country's referendum in two
weeks' time. Mr Dick Spring, Irish opposition Labour party leader, said last
night that Ireland should consider postponing its vote.
In yesterday's referendum, 50.7 per cent voted against the treaty, with 49.3
per cent voting in favour. Turnout was 82.9 per cent.
In rejecting the Maastricht treaty, the voters ignored the advice of the
political establishment, both sides of industry and an almost unanimous
press. The referendum cannot be overturned by the Folketing (parliament).
Financial markets, which had counted on a Yes vote, were also surprised by
the outcome, which confounded the opinion pollsters, whose surveys in the
past few days had pointed to a narrow victory for Maastricht.
Other EC governments including the UK, Germany and France, have said in
recent weeks that a Danish No vote would not stop them from implementing
European political union. But a senior EC official said last night: 'There
is an insurmountable requirement that if any of the 12 member states does
not ratify it, Maastricht goes down the drain. We have made no contingency
planning for a rejection.'
Currency and bond markets reacted cautiously to early indications of the
Danish vote. Dealers reported buying interest in other member currencies of
the European Monetary System, pushing the Danish krone down a little. The
Danish government benchmark 10-year bond fell two points to 99.80 in
inter-bank trading in Copenhagen.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, foreign minister, who fought hard to persuade
voters to accept the treaty, said: 'We face a very difficult time. We must
now think things through very carefully.'
He said it was too early to say whether the government might consider trying
to reverse last night's vote in a new referendum.
The Danish vote may have a significant effect on opinion in the other Nordic
countries, such as Sweden and Finland, which have already applied for EC
membership.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Hongkong Bank increases bid for Midland to Pounds 3.9bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG and Shanghai Banking Corporation increased its bid for Midland Bank
to Pounds 3.9bn yesterday, offering for the first time to pay shareholders
partly in cash.
Midland's rival suitor, Lloyds Bank, responded by hinting that it may
improve its proposed terms, if it is cleared to bid by the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. Mr William Purves, HSBC chairman, said in Toronto his
bank's new bid terms were 'definitely the final offer'.
Although Hongkong Bank is free, under UK Takeover Panel rules, to renew its
bid in the autumn if it does not succeed now, Mr Purves added: 'If Midland
shareholders turn us down and choose to wait for the outcome of the
Monopolies inquiry to see if Lloyds is allowed to bid, those shareholders
should not assume that we will make another bid then.'
For each 100 shares in Midland, shareholders are being offered 120 shares in
the new Hongkong Bank Holding Company after the merger and either Pounds 65
of bonds or Pounds 65 in cash. The offer values each Midland share at 480p.
Last night Midland closed at 452p, up 31p.
The terms were welcomed by Midland and Mr Brian Pearse, chief executive, who
said the bank would recommend shareholders accept the offer. Midland says it
is increasingly worried about the effect on its business of a prolonged
takeover battle.
Mr Brian Pitman, Lloyds chief executive, who was also in Toronto, at a
meeting of the International Monetary Conference, said his board would be
meeting on Friday.
He hinted Lloyds was likely to offer. 'We will have to tell Midland's
shareholders what our offer is worth now and what it could be worth later,'
he said.
However, last night Mr Pearse called on Lloyds to withdraw its proposed bid.
Speaking on BBC Radio's Financial World Tonight, he said: 'Lloyds is now an
irrelevancy. There is now no doubt in my mind that the chances of its
succeeding on competition grounds in its bid for Midland are virtually nil.
It would save us all a lot of irrelevant work if it withdraw.'
In the City, some analysts said the new offer tipped the odds in favour of
the Hongkong Bank bid succeeding. Shareholders remained undecided. One large
institution said: 'Frankly we would much rather be shareholders in Lloyds
Bank. The new Hongkong offer is quite rich and quite tempting but Lloyds is
a natural holding for us and a more logical fit for us than a vague global
bank.'
Hongkong Bank has brought forward the acceptance date on its offer by nearly
two weeks to June 25, giving shareholders little more than three weeks to
decide whether to accept the offer or wait until the autumn in the hope that
Lloyds will be cleared to launch its own bid.
Hongkong Bank is now offering slightly more than Lloyds' proposed terms for
each Midland share, but Lloyds is widely expected to raise its offer above
500p if it gets clearance.
Hongkong Bank's original offer to Midland shareholders gave them 118 shares
in the combined bank and Pounds 50 worth of bonds. valued each Midland share
at 401p.
One important feature of the new offer is that it makes Hongkong Bank bonds
much more attractive to institutions by improving their yield from 1.6 per
cent to 2.4 per cent above gilts and arranging for them to be underwritten
by Credit Suisse First Boston, Schroders, Cazenove, and SG Warburg.
Campaigns will be pressed to a conclusion, Page 24

FT  03 JUN 92 / Brussels left with no clear ideas on next step
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
The European Community has faced crises before - but no one, in Brussels,
Copenhagen, or any other EC capital, has a clear idea of what to do
following the Danish vote to reject the Maastricht treaty.
Previous dramas have usually involved a deadlock, rather than the death of a
full-scale treaty on which negotiations began some four years ago.
It seems slightly incredible that a paper-thin majority in one country could
halt ratification by all EC states of something as far-reaching as forging a
new 21st century single currency and eventual common defence for Europe. But
the Treaty of Rome clearly says such constitutional revisions must be
unanimously agreed - and ratified - by all states.
The Community's normal way out of an impasse is to look to its executive for
guidance. But it is hard to see the Commission, whose usual board meeting
today will be dominated by the treaty crisis, doing more than wringing its
hands.
In treaty revisions, it has no more power of proposal than an individual
member state, and less, in the sense that it is not a signatory.
Certainly, the government in Copenhagen will be fielding queries today from
Brussels and other EC capitals about whether it thinks it could win a second
referendum on a modified treaty. If so, there will be hurried calls on
Portugal and Britain, current and impending presidents of the EC Council, to
see if a renegotiation can be arranged.
For, while it is extremely unlikely, and probably illegal, for Denmark to be
simply sidestepped by its 11 partners, it is also clear that most EC leaders
have invested too much political capital and effort in the endeavour for
them not to seek to salvage some form of political and monetary union. It
only needs a majority - seven out of 12 - of governments to set an
intergovernmental conference rolling.

FT  03 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Automotive shares lively as
French equities rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES seemed to be recovering yesterday from last Thursday's Ascension Day
holiday which, until Monday evening, seemed to be extended in spirit if not
in fact, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS improved with the automotive sector in lively form. The CAC-40 index
closed up 7.47 at 2,024.87 in turnover of some FFr2bn.
Peugeot gained in early trade on the positive outlook for the US car
industry. The car group rose to an intraday high of FFr802.00 before the
release of disappointing May sales figures sent it down to close off FFr4 at
FFr789. However, in spite of Peugeot's fall yesterday the shares have
outperformed the index by 21 per cent in the last year.
Michelin also took comfort from the US data, and a buy note, to close up
FFr4.40 at FFr219.40. Eurotunnel lost 55 centimes to FFr35.95 following an
announcement by the regulator that recent price movements were to be
investigated. Some analysts commented that the warrants have been more
volatile than the shares recently; yesterday they were down 2 centimes at 29
centimes.
FRANKFURT stayed firmly in its consolidation phase, the DAX index closing
just 3.25 higher at 1,801.39 after a 0.12 decline to 718.22 in the FAZ at
midsession. Turnover remained low after Monday's DM5.1bn.
News did not help share prices. A Siemens Eurobond issue with warrants to
raise some Dollars 1.3bn apparently ended an existing game in the expiring
1986/92 warrant series, and the shares fell DM4.60 to DM689.40.
Meanwhile, Schering was unhappy about government proposals to freeze
pharmaceutical prices for two years; the shares fell DM6.80 to DM786.50.
There was an upswing in steels, and some engineers. In construction,
Bilfinger rose DM17 to DM1,075 on a 50 per cent rise in 1991 profits.
MILAN returned to life as its computerised trading system came back on
stream, turnover recovering from a truncated L63bn as the Comit index rose
2.33 to 500.31.
Interest centred on industrials, high asset value stocks lagging behind
because of fears that the government might impose a wealth or real estate
tax. Fiat rose L67 to L5,407, climbing to L5,430 after hours, while the
agro-industrial and chemicals group, Montedison, was L23 better at L1,503.
AMSTERDAM picked up as the dollar strengthened and the CBS Tendency index
finished 0.8 firmer at 131.1. Turnover was a moderate Fl 800.3m.
Attention remained focused on KLM which reports its annual figures tomorrow.
There is a wide range of analysts' forecasts to pick from, but all point in
a positive direction. The shares were 30 cents weaker by the close at Fl
39.60.
Fokker improved 80 cents to Fl 35.50 on unconfirmed reports that
negotiations between the aircraft group and Dasa were nearing completion.
ZURICH's SMI index put on 7.1 to 1,930.4, brokers saying that buying came
mostly from foreign investors.
STOCKHOLM lost most of Monday's gains, the Affarsvarlden General index
falling 5.7 to 992.7 after the suspension of interest payments by two units
of the real estate company, Coronado.
The company said that SE-Banken and Nordbanken were its main creditors.
SE-Banken A lost SKr3 to SKr36.50 in heavy volume. Meanwhile, the insurer,
Skandia, Sweden's largest real estate owner, saw its B SKr6 lower at SKr113.
HELSINKI fell another 1.1 per cent after the 1.0 per cent fall on Monday,
the Hex index closing 8.8 lower at 820.4. Forestry shares rose by 0.3 per
cent on average, due to investor interest in Finnish export companies, but
banks and finance houses fell 1.7 per cent after KOP's report last week of a
widening loss for the first four months of this year.
VIENNA rose in active trade with the ATX index up 11.89 to 1,002.09. The
market was still buoyant following Monday's successful placing of 5.4m new
shares in Vienna airport. Some analysts said that the shares were being
traded on the grey market at Sch370 for a Sch35 premium over the issue
price. Dealing is expected to begin by mid-month. Elsewhere OMV gained Sch21
to Sch922.
BRUSSELS was lifted by interest in cyclical stocks. The Bel-20 index closed
up 2.84 at 1,235.40 in volume estimated at BFr957m.
Solvay advanced BFr175 to BFr13,600 for its fourth consecutive rise, while
Petrofina fell BFr50 to BFr10,750.
MADRID rose on good institutional buying with the utilities sector leading
the way. Endesa gained Pta90 to Pta3,735. The closing index was delayed by
technical problems in Spain.

FT  03 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Light overseas bargain
hunting lifts Nikkei
</HEADLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EQUITIES gained ground in low volume yesterday, with most investors
remaining inactive ahead of next week's expiry of June futures contracts,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average rose 121.44 to 18,125.55. It fell briefly below 18,000 in
the morning session, to 17,953.33, on arbitrage unwinding, but light bargain
hunting by foreign investors and public pension funds lifted share prices
and the index reached a high of 18,308.11 in the afternoon.
Volume rose slightly from 190m shares to 200m. Dealers and investment trusts
focused on short-term trading of speculative theme stocks.
Advances led declines by 478 to 425 with 191 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks rose 4.04 to 1,364.58 and, in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 4.45 to 1082.67.
Traders said that institutional investors were waiting for a chance to buy
at cheaper levels on the expiry of June futures contracts. Due to the low
volume in the September futures and the low price level, the bulk of the
arbitrage positions held against June contracts have not been rolled over
against their September counterparts.
Mr Masami Okuma at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew said that with the expiry for June
contracts only one week away, investors expect unwinding to peak next week,
presenting a favourable opportunity for bargain hunting.
Investors are also waiting for next week's announcement of the Bank of
Japan's tankan, or quarterly survey of business sentiment. Mr Robert Feldman
at Salomon Brothers Tokyo, forecasts weak figures, since a similar survey
conducted by the ministry of international trade and industry indicated that
75 per cent of those surveyed cited poor business conditions.
Mazda Motor rose by its daily limit of Y80 to Y521 on dealer buying. Reports
that the company had developed recyclable plastic for car bodies spurred buy
orders.
Other automotive stocks were weak on the year-on-year 12 per cent decline in
car sales for May, making this the third consecutive month in which they
have fallen. Toyota Motor fell Y10 to Y1,490 and Nissan Motor declined Y14
to Y603.
Foreign buying lifted Nippon Express, the leading parcel delivery company,
by Y2 to Y706. Investors were encouraged by the company's forecast of a 4
per cent rise in pre-tax profits for the current year to next March.
Speculative theme stocks dominated trading. Nihon Nohyaku, the agrochemical
manufacturer, jumped Y100 to Y1,220. However, Nippon Formula Feed, which
originally rose on reports that the company had developed special food for
tuna, lost Y3 to Y600 on profit taking.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 0.62 to 20,833.00 in volume of 17.1m shares.
Roundup
SMALLER markets in the region made most of the running yesterday.
MANILA moved up on reports of new oil finds south of the Philippine capital.
The composite index climbed 17.93 or a little over 1 per cent to 1,405.72,
driven by a 6 per cent rise in the oil sector.
Shell's discovery of oil and gas off southern Palawan island followed
Saturday's start of commercial drilling at nearby West Linapacan, a major
oil find last year. Continued buying from foreign investors took turnover at
Manila's two bourses up from 187.3m pesos to 256.05m.
NEW ZEALAND came back from a day's holiday to higher profits from the
heavyweight blue chip, Telecom, which gained 5 cents to NZDollars 2.15 in
unusually heavy volume of 10.1m shares, lifted by heavy buying in the US.
The NZSE-40 index closed 9.77 higher at 1,584.64 in turnover up from
NZDollars 41.2m to NZDollars 44.6m.
TAIWAN's major players stepped up their efforts in small-capitalisation
stocks, following their recent sharp falls. The weighted index recovered
12.09 to 4468.94.
AUSTRALIA was little changed following news that the economy grew 0.6 per
cent in the March quarter, the All Ordinaries index closing 1.9 higher at in
turnover up from ADollars 170m to ADollars 225m.
Foster's Brewing initially fell 12 cents on news that BHP had appointed
receivers and managers to IBI, a wholly-owned subsidiary of International
Brewing Holdings which holds a 32 per cent stake in Foster's. But it finally
closed up 1 cent at ADollars 2.00. BHP lost 2 cents to ADollars 14.40.
BANGKOK turned jittery as the Thai parliament delayed naming a new prime
minister, and the SET Index plunged 21.8, or 3.1 per cent to 677.10. Volume
was thin, down from Bt3.2bn to Bt2.4bn.
SEOUL fell to a new 1992 intraday low, the composite index hitting 564.53 at
midday, its lowest since September 1990. It recovered to end at 567.34, only
1.85 lower on the day.
SINGAPORE was little changed ahead of a 0.25 percentage point cut in the
prime rate by one of the banks after the close.
BOMBAY rebounded after restrictions were imposed on on fresh selling. The
BSE index ended up 132.59 to 3,133.83.

FT  03 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Foreign investors take stock of China -
But caution is required as the markets are opened up to the west, writes
Simon Davies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES

<TEXT>
It has not been a perfect introduction to capitalism; and it is taking place
in communist China, where two people have been killed over places in the
queue as they battle to buy shares in a stock market which is showing scant
regard for both fundamentals and the laws of gravity.
Since the beginning of March, the Shenzhen index, which tracks the stock
movements of one of China's two official stock exchanges, has jumped 171 per
cent, in spite of the number of stocks on the market almost doubling in the
same period. It makes the performance of the market in neighbouring Hong
Kong appear pedestrian.
People in Shenzhen start lining up in the broking houses' transaction queues
in the evening, so that they can have a chance of buying stocks the next
morning. Gangs have started selling positions in the queue and fights break
out daily, with two deaths and more than 450 arrests so far this year.
Shanghai, the other show-piece exchange, has taken a less frenzied approach,
as befits its greater proximity to Beijing. But it has still been chaotic.
The index rose more than 100 per cent in one day when price restrictions
were lifted two weeks ago, but in two trading days during the following week
it fell 19 per cent when the authorities outlawed investment syndicates. The
fact that new issues are offered through a lottery system has not inspired
international confidence.
It has not been all one-way trade; a local investor recently committed
suicide over losses on an investment in Shanghai Yangzhong Industrial, a
stock which is currently the subject of a market manipulation investigation.
But official reminders of the risks are going unheeded.
At the start of the year, foreigners were allowed to join the fight for
shares. The Shenzhen exchange permitted its Shanghai counterpart to issue
the first tranche of China shares to foreign investors, but the southerners
have expanded more aggressively.
The Shenzhen market boasted six listed companies in January and these were
all A shares, only available to local investors.
During the year a further nine have been added, with six of these issuing B
shares, which can be purchased by foreigners. Analysts expect there to be at
least six more Shenzhen B share issues by the end of the year.
Shanghai has 14 listed companies, of which only Shanghai Vacuum has issued B
shares. However, at least seven more companies will issue B shares this
year.
The foreign issues have been well received. The average premium to issue
price of the six Shenzhen B share issues was more than 380 per cent on
Friday. The most recent issue, Shenzhen Petrochemical, jumped 386 per cent
in its first eight trading days.
This performance is being reflected in the number of China funds being
launched. So far more than 10 funds focusing primarily on B shares have been
launched or are in the pipeline. These have attracted a lot more than the
Dollars 150m so far raised from the issue of China shares to foreigners.
Fundamentals are being ignored. On Friday's closing prices, the average 1992
price-earnings ratio for B shares was 52, compared with under 10 for similar
manufacturing companies in Hong Kong.
Cynics expect to see a repeat of the experience in Indonesia, once a
favoured emerging market. The market was eventually swamped with new paper,
while some earnings forecasts were found to have been plucked from the air;
share prices have slumped for the past two years.
There is also concern over the level of regulation in China. At present
there is no companies law, there is little appreciation of international
accounting standards and a very limited scale of investor protection.
The Chinese authorities are not renowned for their subtlety in dealing with
perceived problems. Further measures are possible, but barring significant
intervention, the down-side is seen as limited until China can issue
sufficient new paper to absorb massive foreign demand.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Homes data hamper dollar rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR staged an early rise on the foreign exchange markets yesterday
following the publication of a strong set of US economic indicators, writes
James Blitz. But its progress was hampered during European trading in the
afternoon by another disappointing set of US home sales data.
The dollar reached a high of DM1.6152 in European trading after the US
leading indicator data for April showed a 0.4 per cent rise against
forecasts of 0.2 per cent. The March indicator was also revised to 0.4 per
cent from an initial 0.2 per cent estimate.
However, these figures were overshadowed in the afternoon, when the home
sales data effectively ended hopes that the housing market would lead the
economy into recovery as it did in the first two months of the year. The
figures showed that single-family home sales had risen just 1.3 per cent in
April to 530,000, when a much stronger rebound to 552,000 had been expected.
Furthermore, the already huge 14.8 per cent March drop was revised to 15.9
per cent.
'The data were pretty bad,' said one economics analyst in London. 'They mean
that practically every housing indicator we watch, from sales to mortgage
applications, is now down or, at best, flat.'
As a result, the dollar ended down on the day at DM1.6075 after a previous
close of DM1.6100. In late American trading it was hovering at DM1.6072. It
also lost ground to sterling. closing at Dollars 1.8250 from a previous
close of Dollars 1.8230.
Despite this poor performance in Europe, the US currency managed to
withstand another bout of intervention by the Bank of Japan in overnight
trading in Asia. Dealers said that the BoJ had purchased Dollars
20bn-Dollars 30bn worth of yen at the Y127.40 rate. But the dollar managed
to shrug off the intervention, ending the day in London at Y127.50, slightly
up on its previous close of Y127.40.
The D-Mark also recovered some ground against the yen in European trading.
The BoJ sales of dollars for yen overnight had helped push the D-Mark down
to its lowest opening level against the Japanese currency for almost three
months. But it clawed back up to DM1.2622 per 100 yen by the finish, well
above this morning's DM1.2655 opening.
The Danish krone made fresh gains yesterday on hopes that Denmark would give
a confident 'Yes' to European Monetary Union in its referendum yesterday.
The krone ended at DKr3.8442 against the D-Mark, slightly stronger after
last night's close of DKr3.8455. Analysts believe that heavy investment in
the krone could push it up from the floor of the European Monetary System's
grid, pushing the Italian lira, and possibly sterling, to the bottom two
places.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Short rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-TERM rates in the sterling cash markets softened yesterday after the
Bank of England forecast a moderately small shortage in its money market
operations.
Short sterling futures also rose slightly, reflecting the prospect of lower
interest rates, following rumours of a co-ordinated cut in rates at next
month's summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial countries.
In the sterling cash market, most interbank rates ended the day a shade
lower. 1-month money ended the day at 9 15/16 per cent, down  1/8 per cent
on the previous day's close. Everything from 2-month to 9-month Libor ended
at 10 per cent, compared to 10 1/16 per cent for 3-month money on Monday
night.
The softening of period rates came as the Bank of England forecast a
shortage of Pounds 650m in the morning, a figure which the market deemed to
be rather small in comparison to the record shortages that it had to cope
with last week.
In the morning, the Bank of England forecast a shortage of around Pounds
300m, which was later revised to Pounds 500m. In the morning, the Bank
bought Pounds 512m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent.
The forecast was later revised to a shortage of around Pounds 650m before
taking account of the morning operations. The Bank then purchased Pounds
159m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent.
Short sterling futures rose yesterday after reports that an unnamed
International Monetary Fund official had suggested that next month's G7
summit would see a co-ordinated interest rate reduction. In the morning, the
September short sterling contract put on 4 ticks to rise to a high of 90.36.
But it later slipped back to close at 90.34, after Japanese officials made
clear that a cut in the discount rate is unlikely for the present. The
closing rate for the September contract suggests that 3-month Libor in
September will be at 9.66 per cent.
One analyst suggested that the market's slowness was due to uncertainty
about this Thursday's Bundesbank Councilmeeting, which will once again
consider a change in interest rates. He suggested that sterling rates could
soften further if the German central Bank decides not to raise rates.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Canada welcomes EC fishing
curb, with reservations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADA HAS welcomed the European Community's unexpected decision to suspend
fishing in the north-west Atlantic, but with the strong reservation that
more time is needed to assess whether it will be implemented effectively.
A senior government official in Ottawa said yesterday that the move was 'a
positive first step'. In particular, the Canadians welcomed the move as an
acknowledgement by the EC of the serious conservation problem in the
north-west Atlantic.
According to Canadian surveillance records, community vessels caught less
than 7,000 tonnes of northern cod in the first four months of this year,
about a quarter of their catch a year earlier. The EC's total self-imposed
quota for this year is 27,000 tonnes.
There is concern, however, that the EC decision, which affects only northern
cod and some minor species, could mark the beginning of a strategy of
'pulse' fishing similar to that pursued by the Soviet Union in the late
1960s. This involves concentrating on one species until it is all but
destroyed.
'We're waiting to see if that's what they're going to do,' the Canadian
official said. Ocean perch and southern cod are seen as especially
vulnerable.
The Canadians also question the strength of the community's commitment to
enforce the suspension. Canada spends CDollars 10-15m (Pounds 4.5m-Pounds
6.8m) a year on aircraft surveillance in the north Atlantic (including the
use highly sophisticated radar equipment), and has 1,000 uniformed and armed
fisheries inspectors.
While welcoming the EC decision, Canada sees strong political overtones in
its timing. Some politicians suspect that it is designed to blunt a
resolution on fisheries conservation proposed by Canada and 39 other
countries at this week's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
The Canadian government is also upset that news of the EC decision was
released only to the media in Ottawa, and only in French. Mr John Crosbie,
Canada's fisheries minister, does not speak French, nor do the vast majority
of Canadian fishermen.
The EC warned that its decision might be rescinded in October or November if
stocks recovered sufficiently and emphasised that in its view Canada's
problems were due above all to overfishing within its 200-mile territorial
waters, not to EC activity, which it called insignificant given the scale of
the problem.
The community's decision to declare a moratorium coincided with a two-day
meeting of the North-west Atlantic Fisheries Organisation's scientific
committee in Halifax, Nova Scotia, to discuss the question of fish
conservation in the area.
'We will abide by anything (the committee) suggests,' said a European
Commission official yesterday. 'But we still maintain that even if there is
a very serious problem with the stocks (in the Grand Banks area), that is
not the reason for the problems within Canada's 200-mile limit.'
The commission reacted angrily to suggestions that its moratorium would
simply provide Portuguese, Spanish and German boats with an excuse to fish
out other species in the area. It also dismissed the allegation that it had
only released the statement in French - a common practice in Brussels - to
pique the Canadian fishing authorities.
'We want to show that we are credible as far as respecting our own quota is
concerned,' said the official.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bolivia sees pots of profit in
coca cuppa - Christopher Philipsborn on hopes for a legal export trade in
the notorious leaf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PHILIPSBORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOLIVIA HAS begun an international campaign to legalise coca leaf exports in
the form of herbal tea, in a bid to replace the leaf's better known
derivative - cocaine.
The government believes coca leaf exports could become more profitable than
cocaine. The leaf has traditionally been chewed to ward off hunger and
discomfort. But is also makes a pleasant tea-like infusion called 'mate de
coca' which is distributed mainly in tea-bag form throughout Bolivia and
much of Peru. Coca leaf is also used in a number of herbal remedies.
Mr Jaime Paz Zamora, the Bolivian president said recently: 'I am convinced
that the coca leaf has a legal use, and should not be under 'house arrest'
by being restricted to Bolivia'. Mr Ronald MacLean, the foreign minister,
made a formal statement at the 22nd assembly of the Organisation of American
States in Nassau calling for 'the legitimate industrialisation and
commercialisation of the sub-products derived from the innocent coca leaf
and its protein-rich and medicinal qualities'.
Coca and its derivatives are classified as intoxicants by the Vienna
Convention as it takes only a relatively simple chemical process to turn the
leaf into the highly profitable drug cocaine hydrochloride. Mate de coca,
however, is a harmless and widely drunk herbal tea in the Andean countries.
Indeed the Bolivian government believes that exports of coca tea-bags, would
bring in substantial export revenues. President Paz claims exports of tea to
5 per cent of the world market would generate greater revenue than the
country's gas exports to Argentina, last year worth Dollars 215m. The
potential price for legally processed coca is estimated at Dollars 100 a kg.
While the government is sincere in its aim to legalise certain coca exports,
the issue is partly political. Bolivia sent substantial quantities of coca
leaf to Spain last month with the intention of demonstrating its tea-making
and other properties to visitors to the Bolivian stand at Expo 92 in
Seville. But Spanish customs caused a storm in a tea-cup by impounding the
entire shipment.
The action caused outrage in Bolivia and prompted a hurried visit by Queen
Sophia of Spain, who valiantly drank gallons of coca tea at every available
opportunity in an effort to patch up relations.
Nevertheless, the issue remains a serious one. While Bolivia is being pushed
by the US to reduce the amount of coca it cultivates, the country has no
obvious alternative cash crops or other exports to take its place at
present. Bolivia is South America's poorest country, with little effective
infrastructure. Coca is easy to transport and continues to fetch better
prices than any other potential substitute. Legalising the exportation of
the harmless tea it produces would be a small but significant step towards
weaning the country away from economic dependence on cocaine.

COPPER broke out from its recent very narrow trading range on the LME, but
did not attract a significant volume of follow-through interest. However,
traders believe it is now likely to support a higher trading range, citing
labour talks at two big North American producers, hopes for economic
recovery in the US, and a relatively low level of stocks. Traders do not
expect a price explosion, but they see a test of Dollars 2,260 a tonne for
three-month metal and possibly a look at this year's high of around Dollars
2,275 before the market establishes a new range. Three-month TIN, encouraged
by a strong Kuala Lumpur market, initially soared to a 21-month high of
Dollars 6,495 a tonne before profit taking emerged. Traders believe the rise
will continue on the back of a shrinking world tin surplus, possible support
via the options market and constructive charts. The premium for cash ZINC
over three-month metal widened further. Traders are concerned about today's
June option declarations, with the possibility of further nearby short
covering resulting if June Dollars 1,500 options are called. PLATINUM and
SILVER moved ahead on the London bullion market on mixed US economic data.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Iceland faces call for 40% cut
in cod catch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   REYKJAVIK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ICELANDERS FACE bleak economic times if their government follows new advice
and orders a sharp cut in fishing for cod, its most important foreign
exchange earner, reports Reuter from Reykjavik.
An advisory committee of the International Council for Exploration of the
Seas said yesterday that the cod stock around the North Atlantic island
could collapse unless the annual catch quota was reduced by 40 per cent in
1993.
'This is the worst news that the Icelandic fishing industry has received,
ever,' said Mr Thorsteinn Palsson, the fisheries minister.
Iceland, with a population of 250,000 and gross domestic product per capita
of Dollars 25,000, relies on fish exports for more than half of its foreign
currency earnings. If the cod catch is cut by 40 per cent GDP could fall by
4 to 5 per cent in 1993, the state-run National Economics Institute
estimated. Earlier the NEI had forecast a 1 per cent median rise in GDP for
the next three years.
Foreign currency income would fall by 10 per cent in 1993 if the council's
advice was followed, the institute said.
'We are going to have to re-examine our economic policies in this light,'
said Mr Thordur Fridjonsson, head of the NEI.
Mr Palsson has until the end of July to decide on quotas for 1993. He is
expected to make up his mind after Icelandic experts have given their
advice.
Cod constitutes 40 per cent of Iceland's fish exports, which in turn make up
80 per cent of national exports.
Despite a rigid quota system designed to conserve the stocks, the cod stock
has been decreasing steadily over the past three decades. Iceland's trawlers
are expected to catch a total of 250,000 tonnes of cod in 1992. The ICES
committee recommended that the catch be lowered to 150,000 in 1993.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chile's golden goose close to
starvation - Lesley Crawford on a history of under-investment in the
state-owned copper industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLEY CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS beginning to dawn on Chileans that Codelco, the state-owned copper
corporation, is not the source of inexhaustible wealth they once believed.
The world's leading copper producer and Chile's biggest company, Codelco has
been milked dry over its 16-year existence. It has provided more than
Dollars 17bn to the state's coffers - about 20 per cent of the government's
yearly income - since its creation in 1976. But the government has
reinvested only 0.2 per cent of Codelco's profits back into the company.
The corporation is now showing all the symptoms of this prolonged
starvation. Profits in the first three months of 1992 plummeted by 36 per
cent to Dollars 175m. Falling copper prices are partly to blame, but rising
production costs at its ageing mines are also gnawing away at the company's
profitability. Last year, Codelco mustered only Dollars 870m for the
Treasury, compared with Dollars 1.5bn in 1990 and almost Dollars 2bn in
1989.
'The lesson of all this is that Codelco's bounty is not eternal,' says Mr
Jorge Bande, the company's planning director. 'We either regain our
competitiveness or we die.'
Codelco has now prised a bigger investment budget from the claws of the
Treasury. Over the next five years it plans to spend Dollars 2.8bn to
develop new mines, modernise its production processes and clean up the
environmental mess caused by its old-fashioned smelters.
But money is only part of the solution. Hidden from public view, a far more
fundamental struggle is taking place over how Codelco should be run. The
struggle pits the company's young management team, which took over the reins
two of political appointees. The seven-man board of directors includes the
ministers of mining and finance, a general of the paramilitary police force,
two other members chosen by President Patricio Aylwin, and two trade union
representatives.
It is significant that Mr Alejandro Noemi, Codelco's chief executive, only
feels free to air his views when he is out of the country. He told a meeting
of the Council of the Americas in New York last month: 'We must promote
efficient management minimising political interference and adopting a
long-term view of resource allocation and strategic planning.'
Mr Noemi, who came close to resigning last year after repeated clashes with
Mr Juan Hamilton, the mining minister, pleaded for a board of directors
'free of party ties, not linked to any single government and guided by the
permanent interests of the country.'
He said Codelco needed to forge a new relationship with its owners. 'This
relationship should be based on a truly independent administration.'
Mr Noemi wants to be allowed to run Codelco as a business that competes on
an equal footing with other mining multinationals. It is unlikely that he
will ever be allowed to do so. Codelco is too important to the Chilean
economy: it produces 13 per cent of the world's copper, close to a third of
Chile's exports, a fifth of the government's income and about 4.5 per cent
of the country's GDP.
A tenth of its gross sales, which totalled Dollars 2.77bn last year, goes
directly to the armed forces. In spite of the country's recent transition to
democracy few Chileans feel bold enough to question why the military should
be the beneficiary of such largesse.
Codelco executives concede that full autonomy is too explosive a political
issue to be raised in the final two years of the Aylwin government. But they
hope that a recent law, allowing Codelco to form joint ventures to explore
and develop new mines, is a step in the right direction.
The new law was muddied at the last moment by a presidential clause urging
Codelco to 'aim for majority control' in its new partnerships with the
private sector.
This did not go down well with the mining multinationals established in
Chile. 'The last-minute clause is a warning of the political meddling to
expect in doing business with Codelco,' one Santiago-based executive said.
Most companies said they liked to have majority control over their
investments.
Codelco's executives see the law as a key factor in the company's long-term
development strategy. It will allow the state company to seek partners when
it does not have resources to develop mining projects on its own. Codelco
owns a third of the registered mining property in Chile, but investment
restrictions have limited exploration and development work.
Potential partners want to see proof, however, of a more modern management
ethic at Codelco before talking business.
The test case will come with the development of the Radomiro Tomic copper
deposit, close to Codelco's Chuquicamata division in the Atacama desert. The
Tomic mine is the first project Codelco begins from scratch and the company
is keen to prove that it can run a new mine as efficiently as its rivals in
the private sector.
Mr Bande says Tomic will be free of the rigidities that plague Codelco's
four existing divisions: the top-heavy administration, widespread
absenteeism and old mines with escalating production costs and dwindling
reserves.
Codelco has set up a separate division to study the feasibility of the
Dollars 450m-venture. It is headed by Mr Holger Bannach, Chuquicamata's
former general manager. Tomic will be a medium-sized operation with an
annual production of some 150,000 tonnes of refined copper. A firm decision
on the project is expected to be taken at the end of this year, with 1995 as
a possible start-up date.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Liffe considers second gilt
futures contract
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE London International Financial Futures and Options Exchange (Liffe) is
considering introducing a second gilt futures contract. The proposal is a
response to growing demand for a means of hedging longer-dated gilt issues.
The existing contract, known as the long gilt contract, is based on gilt
issues totalling at least Pounds 500m which mature between 2003 and 2009.
The contract specification was set in December 1988, when the UK government
was repurchasing substantial amounts of paper. The exchange decided to set
the parameters of deliverable gilts in this way to counter fears of
diminishing supply. However, the nature of the specification means that the
maturity of the gilts has been steadily declining, so that the long gilt
future is now based on 11 to 17-year paper.
The UK government has now resumed issuance of gilts, with two new gilts,
maturing in 20 and 25 years, launched so far this year. More long-dated
supply is expected. As a result, there is growing demand from traders for a
contract based on long-dated gilts. Based on 15 to 25-year gilts, it would
be known as the extra-long contract.
Liffe plans to sound out members on potential demand for such a product. The
exchange may also change the specification of the existing contract at a
later date, in order to align the contract with other 10-year bond future
contracts, common to most markets.
Ironically, Liffe's medium gilt contract - which was based on 10-year gilts
 -failed to take off after its introduction in 1987 and was suspended in
1990. Dealers complain that the lack of a 10-year gilt future makes it more
difficult to trade gilts against other futures markets.
First Chicago Futures and James Capel have joined the four existing
marketmakers in Liffe's three-month Ecu interest rate future.

COMMISSION des Operations de Bourse (COB), the French regulatory body,
confirmed that it had opened an investigation into recent movements in the
price of shares in Eurotunnel, the Channel tunnel operator, Reuter reports.
The inquiry was triggered by a sharp drop in Eurotunnel's stock price last
week following remarks by the chairman of builder Bouygues and speculation
that price manipulation had occurred.
Mr Martin Bouygues, Bouygues chairman, said talks between Eurotunnel and its
contractors, including Bouygues, to resolve a prolonged legal battle over
cost overruns were deadlocked and that he could not rule out Eurotunnel
going bankrupt.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Bonds: French franc deals enjoy strong support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEW international bond issues denominated in French francs continued to find
strong support yesterday, with the sector attracting new borrowers and
international investors.
LKB Baden-Wurttemberg, the triple-A rated German financial institution, made
its first issue in the sector, raising FFr1bn eight-year funding in a deal
lead-managed by BNP Capital Markets.
The deal followed a successful sector debut last week by KFW, another German
state-backed institution. Syndicate officials said more overseas borrowers
were likely to tap the sector while international demand for
franc-denominated assets remained strong.
In addition, French fund managers are eager to buy bonds issued by new
borrowers in order to diversify their credit risk. The market has recently
been dominated by a handful of big issuers.
The LKB issue met with a good response in Switzerland and the Benelux
countries, despite a softer tone in the government bond market. The 8 3/4
per cent paper was re-offered to investors at a fixed price of 99.39, to
yield 35 basis points more than French government paper of the same
maturity.
By the close, the bonds were trading at around 9.33 bid, but the yield
spread over government bonds was stable.
Volvo Group Finance also made a FFr1bn issue, but at the five-year maturity
and lead-managed by Credit Lyonnais. The 9.5 per cent paper was launched
late in the day as a re-offering to investors at 99.88, where the yield is
80 basis points more than government paper.
Participants in the deal reported a more muted response to the issue, partly
because Volvo does not carry a credit rating and remains dependent on the
depressed European car market. The deal was held at the fixed re-offer price
until the close of trading.
Elsewhere, Astra, an Argentine oil company, became the latest Latin American
borrower to tap the international market, launching Dollars 100m five-year
bonds via Citicorp Investment Bank. The paper pays a 9 1/4 per cent
semi-annual coupon and has a put option after three years. The lead manager
said that the paper had been priced, on the basis of the put option, to
yield 350 basis points over three-year US Treasuries.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STATE-owned Austrian Industries (AI) may be forced to postpone plans to go
public next year because of heavy losses at its aluminium arm, Austria
Metall (AMAG).
Metall is expected to suffer combined operating losses of Sch3bn (Dollars
264m) in 1991 and 1992, according to Mr Hugo Michael Sekyra, chairman of AI.
AI has already gone through one postponement of an initial offering because
of poor results at Voest Alpine, its steel subsidiary. It is widely
suspected that a further delay could derail the whole privatisation concept
of the Austrian government.
Mr Sekyra said yesterday he might still try to go ahead with AI's initial
offering by excluding AMAG from the group while the aluminium company is
being restructured.
AI will inject about Sch3bn into AMAG as a temporary bridge, but Mr Sekyra
said AMAG had to cover its losses.
The profitable packaging division, European Packaging Holding, could be
floated in a public offering, he said. The Sch1.8bn initial public stock
offering of the Vienna International Airport (VIE) has closed early because
of heavy oversubscription.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Porsche to shed another 850 jobs
as sales slide
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
PORSCHE, Germany's fading star of the luxury sports car business, is to shed
a further 850 jobs in the coming financial year. Together with other
economies, including 'killing sacred cows' in management and production
methods, the cuts will reduce operating costs by DM100m (Dollars 61.3m) in
1992-93, Mr Arno Bohn, chairman, said yesterday.
The job losses, which will include 300 production workers and bring the
workforce down to around 7,000, follow a cut of 950 in the year to July
1992.
Despite the dire state of the international market for the group's cars and
a 25 per cent drop in sales to DM2.5bn, Porsche will still show a profit for
1991-92, Mr Bohn said.
Pre-tax earnings in the first half slumped 97 per cent to DM2m on sales of
DM1.1bn.
The company could break even on sales of 21,000 cars, Mr Bohn added.
Deliveries in the current year totalled 22,000, compared with around 26,000
a year earlier and about 50,000 in the mid-1980s. Production was expected to
fall 'slightly' next year. Production lines are currently working at just
over 60 per cent of capacity.
At present there were no real signs of improvement in international markets.
'The desire to buy luxury goods is not there,' Mr Bohn said. 'And there are
problems with the social acceptability of cars costing DM100,000 or more.'
The US, which once imported 30,000 Porsches a year, has taken just 4,000
this year, after 6,100 in 1990-91.
Germany is now the mainstay of the business, with sales of 8,000 cars this
year. In Britain, the figure is around 1,200 compared with 2,000. Sales in
Japan have risen by about one-third to about 3,300.
Meanwhile, Mr Bohn stressed that despite offers from Mercedes-Benz and
others, the family-controlled company is still not for sale. 'The
independence of Porsche is the central aim of the family and the board,' he
said.
More concerned with survival than bidding for glory, the company has no
plans to re-enter Formula 1 racing from which it withdrew in 1989. Mr Bohn
estimated racing at that level now costs DM250m a year 'without a driver'.
Last year, Porsche spent less than DM20m on motor sport sponsorship.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Miscalculation calls time on an
era at Foster's - Kevin Brown outlines the rise and fall of an Australian
entrepreneur
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE appointment of receivers to International Brewing Investments (IBI)
marks the end of Mr John Elliott's role as a significant influence on
Foster's Brewing Group, and the downfall of another of Australia's
best-known entrepreneurs.
However, Mr Elliott remains in a different class to entrepreneurs such as Mr
Alan Bond, the former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, who was jailed
for two-and-a-half years last week after being convicted of dishonesty.
Mr Elliott is guilty only of misjudgment, primarily in relation to the 1989
buy-out of Foster's shares. That decision left his private company lumbered
with ADollars 2.6bn (USDollars 1.96bn) debt acquired to finance shares worth
about ADollars 1.6bn.
He built Foster's into the world's fourth-largest brewing group. However, he
also acquired an ill-judged assortment of property, finance, and pastoral
businesses which were to prove highly vulnerable to recession.
The non-core assets were largely responsible for a record ADollars 1.3bn
loss in 1989-90 which triggered the removal of Mr Elliott from Foster's
day-to-day management. They remain a serious problem for Foster's, which has
been unable to find buyers for non-brewing assets worth about ADollars
2.8bn.
Mr Elliott's involvement with the group which is now Foster's began in 1972,
when he acquired Henry Jones (IXL), a small South Australian jam-maker. He
used it as a vehicle to take over bigger companies such as Elder Smith
Goldsbrough Mort, later called Elders IXL.
A pivotal decision was made in 1984 when he orchestrated a takeover of the
much larger Carlton &amp; United Breweries, the manufacturer of Foster's lager.
In 1988, Mr Elliott and BHP agreed on a substantial cross-shareholding which
was designed to protect both companies from bids by the late Mr Robert
Holmes a Court, the Australian corporate raider.
Mr Elliott's luck changed in May 1989 when Harlin Holdings, a private
company controlled by Foster's executives, sought to buy an 18 per cent
stake in Elders IXL as a further defence against Mr Holmes a Court.
Harlin, now known as International Brewing Holdings, misjudged demand from
small shareholders and was forced to acquire 56 per cent of Foster's, using
borrowed funds which it could not repay.
Harlin's financial instability worsened when it became clear that the
dividend stream from the Foster's shares - its only asset - would not be
sufficient to pay interest on its debt.
That debt trap, combined with Foster's losses and write-downs on non-core
assets, contributed to a downward spiral in Foster's share price which left
Harlin technically insolvent.
Mr Elliott resigned as chief executive of Elders in May 1990, but remained
as chairman until November when he was replaced by Mr Nobby Clark, a former
chairman of National Australia Bank.
IBH later sold a 17 per cent stake in Foster's to Asahi Brewing. It has
since suggested several plans to extract value from the group through a
break-up, but has failed to convince other shareholders.
Mr Elliott's last hope of disentangling IBH from Foster's was a merger
proposal put forward last month by SA Brewing, which contained special
provisions for IBH. However, BHP has clearly lost patience.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: KIO more cautious, says former
executive
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE KUWAIT Investment Office (KIO) is now managing only Dollars 25bn to
Dollars 30bn of assets - about half the total of two years ago.
According to a former senior executive, the London-based body, which sold
most of its 10.5 per cent stake in Midland Bank just as a takeover battle
was brewing, intends to pursue a cautious investment strategy under Mr Ali
Albader, its new president. The strategy will be more in keeping with the
activities of a typical pension fund.
The former executive did not indicate whether the assets no longer managed
by the KIO had been spent on the war against Iraq and the subsequent
rebuilding effort, or transferred to other Kuwaiti investment institutions.
However, he referred to comments in November by Mr Abdullah al-Gabandi,
managing director of the Kuwait Investment Authority, the KIO's parent,
predicting Kuwait would have paid off its Dollars 22bn debt for Operation
Desert Storm by the end of 1991. Mr al-Gabandi indicated the money had been
raised mainly from the disposal of liquid assets, including government bonds
and bank deposits.
He said the organisation, which handles a large part of Kuwait's extensive
foreign assets, sold the Midland shares because it wanted to avoid any
controversy which may have arisen from it taking sides in a battle between
Lloyds Bank and Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation.
This type of caution could mean the KIO will be reluctant to take more than
a 3 per cent stake - the level at which an interest must be disclosed - in
any quoted UK company.
It would preclude moves such as its purchase of 21.7 per cent of BP when the
UK government's sale of its remaining stake was hit by the October 1987
stock market crash. BP bought back enough shares to cut the KIO stake to 9.9
per cent, in line with a government divestment order.

<TEXT>
BUDERUS, the German building materials, heating and kitchen equipment and
stainless steel producer 99 per cent owned by Metallgesellschaft, the mining
and industrial group, is raising DM165m (Dollars 101.2m) via a share issue.
The new shares were offered for sale yesterday by a consortium of seven
banks, led by Deutsche Bank, at DM430 a share.
This is the first of several 'spin-offs' to be launched by
Metallgesellschaft following the purchase last year of the non-paper
activities of Feldmuhle Nobel from Stora of Sweden for DM1.45bn.
It is likely that the next partial flotation, probably of the Dynamit Nobel
plastics and explosives business, will take place later this year.
Metallgesellschaft, which owns the stake in Buderus via 80-per cent
controlled MG Industriebeteiligungen, will not be taking up its entitlement
to new shares. Together with two German banks which own the remaining 20 per
cent of the holding company, Metallgesellschaft will receive some DM50m as a
result.
One reason for the flotation is to make the company's shares more widely
available. The company also wants the cash to strengthen its capital base
and help finance planned capital investment of DM450m in 1992 and 1993.
Buderus had a turnover of nearly DM2.9bn in 1991. For the nine months to
end-September, it expects sales of DM2.1bn and pre-tax profits of DM124m.
The dividend for the nine-month period will be DM9 per share.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: S&amp;P downgrades debt rating on
four US airlines
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, has downgraded debt
securities at four of the largest US airlines - a decision which, it said,
reflected the weak economic recovery and the domestic fares wars.
S&amp;P had placed the ratings of the seven leading non-bankrupt US carriers on
credit watch, with a view to a possible downgrading, in late-April.
The airlines affected by the downgradings are American, Delta, Northwest and
USAir. S&amp;P said it was still talking to management at United Airlines, and
that ratings of UAL, United's parent company, remained on credit watch 'with
negative implications'.
Of the four downgraded carriers, S&amp;P said it believed only one - American -
had 'a chance to earn a profit in 1992'. It added that all should report
'greatly improved earnings over the next several year,' but suggested 'the
improvement in credit measures will be restrained by a heavy fixed charge
burden'.
At present, S&amp;P said, the rating outlooks on all four carriers remained
negative - suggesting that ratings could fall again if 'economic weakness
and/or fare competition prevents a return to levels of profitability'.
American attempted to overhaul the domestic fare structure earlier this
spring, but its initiative has since been hit by undercutting. Commenting,
S&amp;P said that 'the new fare structure initiated by American in April has
improved the mix of tickets sold but stimulation of business traffic and
shifts in market share have been modest.
'While airline managements disagree about the profit impact of the new
structure, most believe it will cause a net loss of revenue. More recent
leisure fare cuts will further dilute revenues in the coming months, despite
a flood of bookings,' S&amp;P said.
In the downgradings, the senior debt at AMR, American's parent, and American
Airlines was cut from BBB+ to BBB, for example; senior debt at Delta fared
similarly; at Northwest, it was cut from B+ to B; and at USAir the senior
secured debt was reduced from BB to BB-, and the unsecured senior debt from
BB to B+.
TWA, the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, is laying off 300
employees at its maintenance base in Kansas City.
The airline, which made operating losses of over Dollars 100m in the first
three months of 1992, employs 4,000 workers at the base.
TWA said the 'furloughs' - temporary layoffs which can be reversed -
reflected a reduction in contract work from other carriers.

WALL Street is enjoying unprecedented prosperity, according to figures
released yesterday.
They reveal that New York Stock Exchange member-firms earned record
after-tax profits of Dollars 1.36bn in the first quarter of this year.
The profits were 42 per cent higher than in last year's strong first
quarter, when the NYSE's 316 member-firms that do business with the public
earned Dollars 957m.
The firms' record profits and revenues (which reached Dollars 16.5bn in the
quarter) were achieved on the back of rising stock prices, large new issue
volume and low interest rates, which continued to lure investors into
equities from low-yielding financial assets such as certificates of deposit
and money market accounts.
The NYSE firms also benefited from their efforts to control costs. Total
expenses rose just 0.1 per cent in the quarter to Dollars 14.4bn.
The earnings of the NYSE's specialists (the market intermediaries who bring
buyers and sellers together) fell during the quarter, however. This was an
indication that activity on the exchange floor was lower than the first
three months of last year, when volume was temporarily boosted by heavy
trading during and after the Gulf war.

<TEXT>
MR RICK COPELAND, president of Citicorp's Canadian subsidiary, is taking
early retirement, apparently as a result of the bank's large exposure to
Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Toronto-based developer.
A Citibank spokesman said Mr Copeland was leaving 'to pursue other
interests'. He will remain until a successor is named. Sources within the
bank said staff had been given the news earlier by Mr Copeland's New
York-based superior, Mr Alan McDonald.
Citibank Canada has an exposure to O&amp;Y, both in its own capacity and as an
agent, totalling about CDollars 800m (USDollars 666.6m). Citicorp's
operations in other countries have also been heavy lenders to troubled real
estate developers, including the UK property group, Mountleigh, which
collapsed last week.
Citibank Canada is the second largest foreign-owned bank in Canada, with
assets of CDollars 5.5bn on January 31. However, even before the O&amp;Y
problems, its performance had been lacklustre. The bank earned CDollars 5.1m
in the first quarter, giving a return on equity of only 4.2 per cent. The
full extent of losses from O&amp;Y is likely to be more apparent in results for
the second quarter, which ended on April 30.
Citicorp said in a recent submission to the US Securities and Exchange
Commission it had written off USDollars 101m of loans to O&amp;Y and classified
the remaining USDollars 279m as non-performing.
Mr Copeland, 50, has worked for Citicorp since he graduated in 1967.

BELL Canada, the country's biggest telecommunications utility and the main
subsidiary of BCE, has ordered CDollars 1.1bn (USDollars 910m) of digital
switching equipment from Northern Telecom to accelerate modernisation of the
eastern Canada local network.
The programme will be spread over two years. The new equipment will allow
Bell Canada to introduce new services and boost revenues.
The equipment includes Northern's DMS computerised switches, which are
marketed worldwide. Bell Canada has already converted its long-distance
operations to DMS.
The contract will bolster Northern's revenues in 1992 and 1993, countering
the impact of the recession on the domestic equipment market. Last year,
Northern had total revenues worldwide of CDollars 8.2bn. BCE's consolidated
revenues were nearly CDollars 20bn.
BCE says it will not launch an appeal if federal regulators later this month
decide to open up Bell Canada's monopoly of domestic long-distance telephone
traffic in eastern Canada. 'If competition is the name of the game, then
let's have it,' said Mr Lynton Wilson, BCE president.
Several groups want to compete with Bell Canada in the long-distance market,
including Unitel, owned by Rogers Communications, and Canadian Pacific.

launch of Mini Disc
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN A sudden reversal of policy, Warner Music Group yesterday offered its
conditional support to Sony's new Mini Disc audio technology format just one
day after apparently withholding that support.
Mr Robert Molgado, chairman of Warner Music, a division of US entertainment
giant Time Warner, said the US label wanted to release titles on Mini Disc
and participate in the product's launch later this year.
That commitment, however, was conditional on Warner receiving further
responses from Sony and from other equipment manufacturers that address
Warner's concerns about the effect of the new audio technology on sales of
compact disks.
Even with the conditions, Mr Delgado's comments represent a turnround for
Warner.
Only a few days earlier, the US label appeared to rebuff Sony when it said
the relative merits of the Mini Disc and its main rival, the digital compact
cassette soon to be launched by Dutch group Philips, were still under
review.
Until that first announcement Sony had been confident that Warner would
commit its powerful roster of stars to Mini Disc, a portable recording and
playback system which the Japanese group hopes will become the main
successor to the analog cassette tape.
For Mini Disc players to succeed, Sony must offer a wide range of music
titles to potential buyers when the product first hits the market later this
year.
Warner's change of heart yesterday is believed to have followed
ministrations from senior Sony executives, who reportedly protested
vigorously on Monday about the US label's luke-warm support for Mini Disc.

   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
YMOS, one of Europe's largest car components manufacturers, has reported
losses of nearly DM200m (Dollars 124m) for 1991, mainly because of 'balance
sheet fraud'.
Speaking at an extraordinary shareholders' meeting in Frankfurt, Mr Gerhard
Krischer, chief executive, explained how a review over recent months had
produced evidence of sustained fraud. This will contribute DM110m to a total
loss of DM196m for last year. Turnover was DM660m.
Mr Krischer said that the losses, which have wiped out shareholders' equity,
will necessitate a capital write-down and an injection of fresh funds.
This will be backed by Cockerill Sambre, the Belgian company which took a
majority stake in Ymos in February 1990.
On top of the loss caused by the alleged fraud, operating losses last year
were DM35m including restructuring costs; a reorganisation of the valuation
process for tool subsidies led to a further DM44m loss; and losses of DM8.5m
were brought forward from the previous year.
According to the chief executive, the alleged fraud involved improper
accounting for the ownership of tools; falsely obtained government
subsidies; and asset manipulation involving double-counting of previously
obtained subsidies.
The alleged fraud took place before Cockerill Sambre bought its stake, the
meeting was told. Without saying who was responsible,the company said it
planned to press charges and seek damages.
Investigations by accountancy firms had proved that over several years 'a
false picture' of the company's business and financial position had been
painted. This had shown either that the company had been making profits when
in fact it had been making losses, or that losses were lower than they were
in reality.
'This picture has now got to be corrected,' Mr Krischer said.

<TEXT>
THE FRENCH government's decision to reduce its direct stake in Total, the
oil company, will give the group valuable extra freedom, but its new
relationship with the government has yet to be defined, Mr Serge Tchuruk,
group chairman, said yesterday.
The move, expected to raise up to FFr10bn (Dollars 1.85bn) to fund the
government's employment policies, would make it easier for Total to raise
fresh equity capital in the future, would improve its image among foreign
investors, and reassure potential business partners, he said.
In the past, Total's ability to issue new shares had suffered because the
financially hard-pressed state wanted to keep its 34 per cent ownership
level unchanged but could not always afford to subscribe to rights issues,
Mr Tchuruk told a shareholders' meeting.
'In the US or the UK, the fact of being state-owned or state-controlled, in
the eyes of analysts is a handicap,' he added. The state share sale 'will be
appreciated on this point'.
Potential business partners were sometimes worried about the state's
control, he added.
However, just how much control the state will exert at Total remains fully
to be defined, he admitted. The government has indicated that it wants to
retain the right to choose the chairman and the main administrators, as well
as to vet international agreements.
How Total's relations with the state would be 'clarified' was still under
discussion, said Mr Tchuruk. The share sale is to take place as soon as the
new relationship between Total and the government has been agreed and when
market conditions permit.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Dassault attacks orders for US
aircraft
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN European governments should be obliged to buy European defence
equipment or see their defence industries wither, Mr Serge Dassault,
chairman of Dassault Aviation, the French maker of jet fighters and business
aircraft, said yesterday, writes William Dawkins.
In an article in a French newspaper, Mr Dassault, whose company has not
received a military aircraft export order for four years, attacked Finland
and Switzerland for recently buying American F-18s, competitors to the
Dassault Mirage 2000-5.
'European preference must be absolute, not just for countries in the
European Community, but also for those who want to join it, like for
example, Finland and Switzerland, which decide to equip their air forces
with an American aircraft. One cannot measure the considerable damage caused
by the non-observance of this rule . . . Every time a European country
chooses American equipment instead of European equipment, Europe shrinks,'
he wrote.
The only exceptions to a general preference for European suppliers must be
for equipment that cannot be developed there, just as the US government only
seeks European defence equipment if it cannot be made in the US, he argued.
Dassault has been badly hit by the squeeze on the French defence budget,
intensifying pressure on it to seek export markets. Net profits fell by 29
per cent last year, to FFr263.9m, on turnover down 15 per cent to FFr15.9bn.
The group also makes Falcon executive aircraft, but military sales still
accounted for 75 per cent of last year's FFr15.9bn, a proportion which
Dassault is aiming to reduce to 55 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE LIST of Italian state-owned companies planning to raise money from
private investors is set to grow following the news yesterday that
preliminary prospectuses for Agip and Snam should be ready within the next
month, writes Haig Simonian.
Mr Gabriele Cagliari, the chairman of ENI, the energy and chemicals group
which owns the companies, said that valuation work should be finalised soon.
Although ENI had already indicated plans for an initial public offering of
shares in Agip and Snam on the Milan and foreign stock exchanges this year,
this is the first time it has given any precise indication of the timing.
Both companies are highly profitable. Agip, which is Italy's biggest oil and
gas group, announced net earnings of L1,101bn (Dollars 908m) on sales of
L10,957bn last year. Snam, which specialises in distributing natural gas,
made after tax profits of L635bn last year on sales of L11,479bn.
Mr Cagliari gave no indication of how much of the two companies would be
floated, although he indicated that the overall transaction should raise
around L2,000bn.
IRI, the state-owned group, is is also planning to tap investors later this
year.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ILVA, the state-owned Italian group which is Europe's third-biggest steel
producer, swung to a loss of L498bn (Dollars 410m) last year after net
profits of L115bn in 1990 on the back of static sales of L10,608bn.
The results are a blow for the group, which had hoped for a stock market
flotation later this year.
Italian bourse rules require a company to show three consecutive years of
profits before listing their shares.
Ilva, which had been profitable in 1989 and 1990, will now only be able to
quote its shares through a merger with an already quoted company.
As expected, the company allocated L411bn of capital gains made in 1991 into
a special restructuring fund to help overcome continuing difficulties in the
market this year.
Like its European counterparts, Ilva has been hit by the sharp fall in
prices for many steel products at a time of rising competition from
manufacturers in eastern Europe and developing countries.
The group, which took its present form in 1988, is controlled by the IRI
state holding company and was created from the ashes of the ill-fated
Finsinder steel group.
Ilva managed to contain the fall in gross operating profits, which slipped
by L194bn to L1,314bn, by saving around L290bn through cost reductions.
However, the savings failed to compensate for a sharp fall in earnings
caused principally by lower product prices.
Ilva's results were also hit by L280bn in restructuring costs associated
with the group's continuing redundancy programme, which saw the workforce
cut by about 2,000 to 42,866.
Meanwhile, investments at group level rose by around L200bn to over
L1,300bn, while debt charges for the parent company level fell by L176bn to
L514bn.

FT  03 JUN 92 / International Company News: Qantas and Australian to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S Labor government yesterday announced plans to merge two
government-owned airlines, followed by a sale to the private sector of all
the capital in the merged carrier.
Mr Paul Keating, the prime minister, said Qantas, the international carrier,
would pay ADollars 400m (Dollars 303m) today to acquire Australian Airlines,
the domestic carrier.
Mr Keating said the merged airline would be privatised through the sale of
35 per cent of its shares to foreign airlines, and the sale of the remaining
65 per cent to Australian interests. British Airways, Singapore Airlines and
Japan Airlines are seen as contenders in the sell-off.
He added that the sale was expected to return a net ADollars 1bn to the
government, implying a sale value of more than ADollars 2bn, after taking
account of the ADollars 400m cost of acquiring Australian and Qantas'
refinancing requirements of between ADollars 600m and ADollars 1bn.
Mr John Ward, Qantas chief executive, said the merged airline would be
valued at between ADollars 2.4bn and ADollars 3bn. Such a price tag would
make the sale Australia's biggest privatisation, dwarfing the ADollars 1.3bn
sale last year of 30 per cent of the government-owned Commonwealth Bank.
The government has not yet decided whether there should be a ceiling on
foreign holdings. However, it hopes to sell most of the shares reserved for
Australians by way of a flotation early next year.
Mr Keating also announced the establishment of an independent tribunal to
award international routes to the merged airline and Ansett Australia, the
privately-owned domestic airline which is to be Australia's second
international carrier.
The announcement marks the fourth significant change in Australian aviation
policy since October 1990, when deregulation of the domestic market swept
away decades of strict government control.
The government said in April 1991 it would privatise 49 per cent of Qantas
and 100 per cent of Australian, but banned the two airlines from holding
equity in each other.
In February, it said cross-shareholdings between the two airlines would be
allowed, but confirmed that 51 per cent of Qantas would remain in government
hands. It also foreshadowed the award of international licences to Ansett
and the creation of a single aviation market with New Zealand.
The latest change of policy reflects a growing conviction among ministers
that the value of the two airlines would be increased significantly by a
merger and full privatisation.
Only a handful of serious bidders emerged for the separate sales, led by
British Airways, Singapore Airlines and Air New Zealand.
The sale of 100 per cent of the capital in the airline would breach Labor
policy, and will have to be confirmed by a special party conference.
Labor's parliamentary party approved the proposal yesterday, but there was
strong opposition from the influential left-wing faction, which supports the
existing policy of maintaining 51 per cent government ownership of Qantas.
The government would also retain a 'golden share' to protect national
interests, such as the ability to commandeer aircraft during emergencies.

DEUTSCHE Aerospace (DASA), the defence and aerospace subsidiary of
Daimler-Benz, scraped into the black with a profit of just DM50m (Dollars
31m) last year, on turnover of DM12.4bn, compared with a loss of DM135m in
1990.
Mr Jurgen Schrempp, chief executive, warned that the company still faced
'difficult times' in the coming years, with uncertainty over a string of
public-sector projects. 'Uncertainty and change will accompany us in the
future, but there is also confidence, clearer structures and an increasingly
vivid vision of a truly global company,' he said.
The most immediate uncertainty concerns the European Fighter Aircraft, in
which DASA has a 33 per cent stake. The German government is expected to
pull out of the project by the end of the month.
At the same time, a question-mark hangs over the company's two space
projects, the Hermes shuttle, and the Columbus space station, both of which
will be delayed and may be cut back because of the budget squeeze in Bonn.

THE DANISH Finance Inspectorate, the banking system watchdog, has asked the
police fraud department to investigate transactions in the Hafnia Insurance
Group with a view to bringing charges against members of the Hafnia board,
writes Hilary Barnes in Copenhagen.
The action is the result of loans made to Hafnia Holding, the parent
company, from its insurance subsidiaries. Such loans are illegal under
Danish law.
The existence of the loans - for a total of about Dkr470m (USDollars 76m) -
became known in April. The loans have all been repaid, Mr Ebbe Christensen,
chairman of Hafnia's supervisory board, told the annual meeting of
shareholders yesterday.
Police will investigate the circumstances which led to the loans being made.
The loans to Hafnia Holding were made to bolster the parent company's
finances, which came under pressure when Hafnia and Norway's UNI Storbrand
tried last winter to stage a takeover of Skandia, the Swedish insurance
group.

profits shrink to Pounds 1.26m

   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JS PATHOLOGY, the UK's only quoted clinical pathology company, is being
bought for Pounds 23.1m by Corning, the US speciality glass and laboratory
services group.
Corning is offering 175p cash for each of JS share. It will become part of
its CLSI laboratory services subsidiary.
Dr Jean Shanks, chairman and chief executive, has accepted for her 52.2 per
cent of the equity. She and other members of the management will stay on.
JS also released results yesterday for the year to March 31. Pre-tax profit,
which peaked at just over Pounds 4m in 1987-88, fell from Pounds 2.66m to
Pounds 1.26m.
A Pounds 1m tax credit after three years of over-provision led to earnings
per share of 8.5p before the gain and 16.5p after it, compared with 13.2p.
The final dividend is omitted leaving shareholders with 1.8p (5.5p) for the
year.
Mr Eric Rothbarth, finance director, said the group had assumed no capital
allowances when it was in fact entitled to them.
Net assets stood at Pounds 13.6m and net debt had risen to Pounds 4.9m after
the completion of a Pounds 14.5m investment in new premises at Camden Lock,
north London.
The disruption and cost of the move, from Harley Street, was one of the
reasons for the profits decline over the past two years.
Others were cuts in corporate occupational health schemes during the
recession, increased competition and a reduced number of clinical trials in
the wake of pharmaceutical company mergers.
JS came to the USM in 1985 with a market value of just over Pounds 19m and a
flotation price of 160p.
On the brink of the October 1987 crash, it had soared to 675p. Mr Rothbarth
said the company's p/e ratio had tended to run at between 20 and 60, 'making
it difficult to value'.
Although the group was emerging from a difficult period, the decision to
sell would enable the management to 'get down to serious work' after being
chased.
Corning made the only offer, but there had been interest from other parties
and Dr Shanks, at 66, had been keen to see the company 'in safe hands.'
Mr Rothbarth added that benefits would follow from liaison with CSLI's
laboratories in the US and from doing pathology work for some of its
European operations.
It was announced on May 26 that JS was in bid talks following a 33 per cent
jump in its share price to 153p. In February the price had sunk to 94p. It
gained 16p yesterday to close at 170p.

<TEXT>
HUNTERPRINT, the specialist printer which new management is trying to turn
round, yesterday announced an interim loss and said previous forecasts of
profits for the full year were premature.
The company, which came close to collapse before a refinancing and
management shake-up 15 months ago, reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.85m
for the 26 weeks to March 31, compared with a Pounds 4.68m loss in the
corresponding period.
Mr Geoff Eades, who took over as finance director in January, said there was
little prospect of a profit for this year. 'We may have raised expectations
too early,' he said.
Depressed margins, which have remained worse than anticipated, were to blame
for the result. Because of recession, large contract printers have entered
the spot, or one-off, market in which HunterPrint specialises.
Turnover increased by 24 per cent to Pounds 28.8m. Sir Ian MacGregor,
chairman, said order books were 43 per cent higher than a year ago, and new
business wins included a 1.5m copies-a-week contract for the Sunday People
colour supplement.
Operating losses were contained at Pounds 2.3m (Pounds 4.29m). Interest
costs were little changed at Pounds 1.54m (Pounds 1.64m). Borrowings
increased slightly to Pounds 30m (Pounds 27m) on shareholders' funds of
about Pounds 3.5m. The company was cash negative for the period, although it
generated cash during the first quarter. Mr Eades said.
Losses per share were 2.15p (3.89p). Again no dividend is being paid.
There was a retained loss of Pounds 3.85m (Pounds 4.61m retained loss).

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: TSB to take full control of Jersey
subsidiary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB, the seventh largest UK banking group, is to buy out the minority
shareholders in TSB Bank Channel Islands, its Jersey-based subsidiary.
TSB said TSBCI would continue to offer a full range of clearing bank
services in the Channel Islands, but it now plans to use its operation on
the islands to develop offshore businesses.
The four independent directors on the TSBCI board are recommending
shareholders to accept the offer.
Mr Alastair Dempster, TSBCI's chief executive, who was recently appointed
chief executive of TSB Bank Scotland, will be succeeded by Mr Martin
Chambers, managing director of Hill Samuel Bank (Jersey), as soon as the
offer becomes effective.
TSBCI had total assets of Pounds 1.34bn at the end of April. Its half year
results to April 30 announced yesterday showed a pre-tax profit of Pounds
4.77m, against a loss of Pounds 483,000 in the same period a year ago when
it was hit by a Pounds 5.78m loss on foreign exchange irregularities in its
Treasury.
Earnings per share were 13.19p, against losses of 1.39p per share a year
ago. The interim divided is 4p (3.45p).
In the year to October 31 1991, TSBCI made pre-tax profits of Pounds 4.48m
and had a net asset value of Pounds 52.7m.
About 49 per cent of TSBCI's shares were floated on the Stock Exchange in
1986. TSB Group already owns all the A ordinary shares in TSBCI and controls
51 per cent of the total stock.
TSBCI shareholders will be offered 250p cash for each share or seven new TSB
group and 13p in cash for every four TSBCI shares.
The offer is 63 per cent above the TSBCI closing price of 153p on May 29.

670,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
METRO RADIO Group, the USM-quoted local radio station operator, saw its
shares drop 18p to 196p when it announced a fall in profits for the half
year to March 31.
The pre-tax line was down from Pounds 709,000 to Pounds 670,000. The interim
dividend, however, is maintained at 1.5p.
Metro is based in Newcastle and in October 1990 acquired Yorkshire Radio
Network for Pounds 16m.
Trading profits were 4 per cent ahead at Pounds 815,000 (Pounds 782,000) on
turnover up 19 per cent from Pounds 5.84m to Pounds 6.96m. Higher net
interest charges of Pounds 145,000 (Pounds 73,000), reflecting the YRN
acquisition, caused the pre-tax profit fall. Earnings per share were 2.64p
(3.05p).
Mr Neil Robinson, chairman and chief executive, said that a considerable
investment in the YRN business since acquisition, particularly in Sheffield,
was now bringing higher audiences, revenues and profitability. The
investment would mean revenues could be increased in future without
expanding the cost base.
In the Yorkshire area sales were up 54 per cent but were 6 per cent lower in
the north-east of England. Group advertising revenues were up 16 per cent
and accounted for Pounds 5.94m of total turnover.
Mr Robinson, who is shedding his chief executive role at the end of the
year, said that the second half of the financial year had 'started fairly
well' although trading conditions were not consistent with variations from
month to month and market to market, making it difficult to give a clear
indication of the year's outcome.
Mr John Josephs is to become group managing director, while his role of
finance director will be taken by Mr Eric Lawrence, currently financial
controller.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ERNST &amp; YOUNG, the accountancy firm, has purchased a 12 per cent stake in
Kalchas, a London-based strategic consultancy, in the first of a number of
alliances it plans to help broaden its consulting arm over the next three
years.
Kalchas, which expects to bill more than Pounds 3m this year, will remain at
arms' length, preserving client confidentiality and operating with separate
offices, projects and staffing.
Discussions on the purchase began 18 months ago, and the firms have begun to
tender for projects jointly.
Mr Clive Williams, head of consulting at Ernst &amp; Young, said he planned to
take several more stakes in other firms in particular market segments or
offering special services as part of a process of 'branding' the consultancy
arm.
The purchase price has not been disclosed. Ernst &amp; Young will receive
dividends and voting rights in proportion to its stake. It may buy more
shares in the future, but stressed that it wants Kalchas to remain a
separate company.
Kalchas - named after the adviser to Agamemnon in Greek mythology who is
credited with inventing the Trojan horse - was formed in 1988 by two
partners from Bain and one from McKinsey, the consultancy firms.
It now has two additional junior partners and 30 professional staff, and
specialises in offering long-term strategic consulting to senior executives.
The consultancy division of Ernst &amp; Young has about 360 professionals.

Efficiency savings and reduced operating expenses helped Cheam Group,
formerly Sutton District Water, to a 16 per cent profit increase for the
year to March 31.
The pre-tax figure came out at Pounds 2.4m, against Pounds 2.07m for the
previous 12 months, struck on turnover up from Pounds 10.8m to Pounds 12m.
The reported comparable figures for the 15 months to March 31 1991 showed
profits of Pounds 2.37m on turnover of Pounds 12.8m.
An unchanged final dividend of 4p is proposed, making a 7.5p for the year
against the same for the 15 months.

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Restructuring lifts Devenish to Pounds 4.2m
 -Boddington attacks 'disappointing' pub operating profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JA DEVENISH, the west country-based pub operating company, which may face a
renewed bid from Boddington, the pubs, hotels and healthcare group, later
this month, more than doubled interim pre-tax profits from Pounds 2.09m to
Pounds 4.24m.
The outcome for the six months to March 31 reflected the effects of
restructuring, including the sale of the loss-making Redruth brewery and a
Pounds 1.2m reduction in interest charges, that followed Boddington's
unsuccessful bid last year.
Turnover fell from Pounds 46m - Pounds 17.9m of which related to
discontinued activities - to Pounds 30.4m.
Boddington has retained a 20.3 per cent stake and may resume hostilities
after June 18. Mr Denis Cassidy, Boddington's chairman, seized yesterday on
a 'disappointing' fall in Devenish's pub operating profits for the half year
from Pounds 6.05m to Pounds 5.85m. 'Operating profits have shown no growth
since 1990,' he remarked.
Devenish, which announced yesterday that it is to acquire 28 pubs from
Whitbread for Pounds 16.9m cash, stressed its determination to maintain its
independence.
'Trading conditions have been difficult with the recession continuing,' said
Mr John Clark, chief executive. 'Traditional pubs, which form the majority
of our estate, have proved resilient; and the cost of repositioning a number
of our operations on more traditional lines has been the prime factor in the
small decline in operating profits.
'Everything is now in place for growth,' Mr Clark added. 'Our strategy is
clearly focused on pub retailing and our acquisition policy has given us the
pubs to work on. We aim to ensure that it is our shareholders who will
benefit.'
Earnings per share more than doubled to 5.8p and the interim dividend is
raised 25 per cent to 1.5p.
The purchase from Whitbread, which follows the leasing of 115 pubs from the
national brewer in April, will increase the Devenish estate to 539 houses
compared with 376 last September.
The latest acquisitions include 18 Roast Inns and nine Henry's Cafe Bars.
They are located mainly in the Midlands and the south of England, Devenish's
targeted growth areas.
'These are high quality outlets operating in good sites with strong turnover
and fit perfectly into our development criteria,' said Mr Clark.
Devenish will pay Pounds 14.9m on completion of the deal - expected in
August, subject to shareholders' approval - and the Pounds 2m balance in
February next year. The acquisition will increase borrowings to about Pounds
40m, less than 30 per cent of shareholders' funds.

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cautious Dunhill climbs to Pounds 76m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DUNHILL HOLDINGS, the luxury goods group, shook off the worldwide recession
and the aftermath of the Gulf war to increase pre-tax profits by 3 per cent
to Pounds 76m in the year to end-March.
At the half-way stage the group had reported an 8 per cent decline in
profits. The shares rose 12p to 482p.
Lord Douro, chairman, said that trading improved in many areas in the latter
part of the year, although in Japan conditions had worsened recently.
He said that the figures were creditable under the circumstances. However,
the percentage increase was the lowest for 10 years. He expressed caution
about the current year.
Rothmans International, the tobacco company, has a 57.67 per cent stake.
Rothmans is in turn controlled by Compagnie Financiere Richemont, the Swiss
holding group.
Sales rose by 12 per cent to Pounds 254.6m (Pounds 227.2m). They were
boosted by the acquisition in June last year of Hackett, the men's
outfitter, and the purchase of a 34 per cent stake in Dunhill's Japanese
distributor. Turnover on a like-for-like basis was 5.5 per cent higher.
Operating profits were static at Pounds 55.7m (Pounds 55.1m). An increase in
net interest received to Pounds 20.3m (Pounds 18.7m) helped pre-tax profits,
which were up from Pounds 73.9m. Net cash rose from Pounds 163.8m to Pounds
179.6m.
After a slightly lower tax rate, earnings per share rose to 28.4p (27.3p). A
proposed final dividend of 4.95p gives a total of 7.7p (7p), which is
covered 3.7 times.
As well as the Alfred Dunhill brand the group owns Montblanc pens, Hackett,
and Chloe, the French fashion and fragrance business. On Monday Dunhill
announced the purchase of Karl Lagerfeld, another French fashion house.
Lord Douro said that the group had been offered many possible acquisitions
but often these were at high prices. The group had decided in the main to
invest more in its own brands - through buying more distributors, opening
shops and widening product ranges, for example the introduction by Chloe of
leather accessories.

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: British Biotechnology pathfinder published
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Biotechnology Group yesterday published the pathfinder prospectus
for its international share offer planned for July.
The Oxford-based pharmaceutical company says it aims to raise some Pounds
30m by selling about 20 per cent of its equity through a share issue in
London and New York. The issue is expected to be priced at between 400p and
450p, valuing the company at about Pounds 150m.
British Biotechnology will use the proceeds of the flotation primarily to
fund its research and development programme, which covers four medical
areas: inflammatory diseases such as arthritis; cancer; vascular and heart
disease; and viral infections, including Aids.
It has two drugs undergoing in early clinical trials and a third due to
begin clinical testing in August. But the group 'does not expect to market
or generate revenues from the commercialisation of its pharmaceutical
products until at least the latter half of the 1990s.'

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Caledonia buys 27.3% stake in Exco from B&amp;C
administrators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CALEDONIA Investments, which once controlled British and Commonwealth
Holdings - the financial services group that collapsed two years ago - has
acquired a 27.3 per cent stake in Exco International from the administrators
of B&amp;C.
The move follows Caledonia's purchase last November of a 45 per cent stake
in Bristow Helicopter Group, which also used to be part of the B&amp;C stable.
Caledonia, which is 47 per cent owned by the Cayzer family, has paid Pounds
20.5m for the Exco holding as part of a placing of 60 per cent of the
equity.
This has valued Exco, one of the City's leading money brokers, at Pounds
75m. Mr Stephen Adamson, one of the admin-istrators from Ernst &amp; Young, said
this was after stripping out Pounds 80m in dividends for B&amp;C.
Values for Exco bandied about previously have included Pounds 230m, had B&amp;C
avoided administration, and Pounds 100m, before stripping out the Pounds
80m.
Caledonia backed the management buy-out of Exco from Gerard &amp; National, the
discount house, in 1978. The buy-out was led by Mr John Gunn, later B&amp;C's
chief executive.
In late 1986, B&amp;C bought Exco for Pounds 673m. The following year, before
the stock market crash, B&amp;C bought most of Caledonia's stake for Pounds
427m. At the time, B&amp;C's market value was Pounds 1.5bn.
Mr Gunn is not involved in the renewal of Caledonia's links with Exco. B&amp;C
went into administration two years ago today - its peak debt was Pounds
1.2bn.
Exco has remained profitable throughout - last year it made a pre-tax profit
of Pounds 18.5m - although attempts to float or sell it proved unsuccessful.
Mr Richard Lacy, Exco's chief executive, said it had been a difficult
period. The administrators' efforts 'to trawl the marketplace' to find a
buyer had consumed a lot of management time. 'It would have been better to
have a quick sale and to get on with life.'
It could now concentrate on its money broking and government securities
broking businesses, improve its services to clients and develop new
products.
Mr Peter Buckley, Caledonia's chief executive and a member of the Cayzer
family, said: 'We know the people who run Exco. They have been through a
difficult time and we have an opportunity to participate in a company that
has a new lease of life.' He is joining the Exco board as a non-executive.
Other institutional investors include funds managed by Gartmore Investment,
Fleming Investment Management, Nihon Tanshi and Nittan AP. Employees will
ultimately gain a 15 per cent holding. B&amp;C retains 40 per cent.
Mr Adamson said: 'As we were in a position to start paying dividends to
shareholders, the placing gives us some money now and a substantial stake in
the future. We believe the 40 per cent we have retained will produce its
rewards.'
Exco was advised by NM Rothschild, which also arranged the placing.

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Fall at Powell Duffryn less than City had
feared
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Powell Duffryn, the distribution, storage and engineering company,
jumped 30p to 396p yesterday on news of far better-than-expected profits of
Pounds 24.6m pre-tax in a year of wide-ranging restructuring.
The profits, which were struck on turnover Pounds 25.5m down at Pounds
749.3m, represented a 15 per cent decline on the previous year.
Analysts had been expecting a much sharper decline to Pounds 21m for the
year to March 31.
The dividend - maintained for the third year at 22.6p via a same-again 16p
final - also helped to support the shares, although cover fell from 1.4 to
1.1 times.
During the year, PD shed its quarrying interests, shifted its marine
transport focus to land-based services with the acquisition of Tees and
Hartlepool port, expanded its engineering businesses and quit foundries.
The refocusing - which included several disposals - left the group with
gearing of less than 20 per cent.
Mr David Hubbard, chairman, said the group's strategic activities had been
more important than the actual results.
However, he added: 'A 15 per cent decline in a . . . group which is 80 to 90
per cent reliant on the (depressed) UK . . . is a figure not to be ashamed
of.'
The largest factor in the group's decline was attributed to the Pounds 4m
loss at Powell Duffryn Standard, which is developing a railway freight wagon
base - known as a bogie - for use on both sides of the Channel.
Orders for traditional railway wagons - which normally run to between Pounds
25m and Pounds 30m annually and were expected to offset losses on the new
bogies - had disappeared, Mr Hubbard said. Profits at the engineering
division overall fell to Pounds 12.2m (Pounds 13.9m).
A further large fall came in UK petroleum products, where operating profits
tumbled to Pounds 3.9m (Pounds 8.3m).
A mild winter and the depressed automotive industry had cut overall profits
at fuel distribution from Pounds 12.8m to Pounds 9.5m.
Shipping services contributed Pounds 10.6m (Pounds 10.2m), buoyed by the
inclusion for two months of PD's share in Tees and Hartlepool.
The port is estimated to have contributed Pounds 1.1m.
Retained profits rose by 43 per cent to Pounds 23.8m, helped by an Pounds 8m
extraordinary net gain on disposals and closures.
Earnings per share fell from 30.7p to 24.5p.
COMMENT
Cinderella may have found her ticket to the ball. Never known for being a
glamorous stock, Powell Duffryn is drawing some ardent admirers. The rapid
changes of the last eight months have given it a solid base from which to
grow and appear to have confounded the sceptics over PD's dividend policy.
The acquisition of the Tees and Hartlepool port looks especially encouraging
and will require far less investment than the shipping businesses would have
needed for similar growth. The coal division, meanwhile, is growing on
British Coal's drive for efficiency and is likely to retain the benefits
after privatisation. Forecasts are pitched at about Pounds 29.5m - for a
prospective p/e of about 13.7 times - with the dividend likely to enjoy its
first increase in four years. Even taking into account last night's 8 per
cent advance in share price, there could still be more to come.

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: De La Rue jumps to Pounds 76.2m - Cost
cuts, productivity gains and acquisitions boost performance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DE LA RUE, the bank note printing and cash handling machine group, reported
a 29 per cent jump in profits after another year of cut-ting costs and
productivity gains.
Pre-tax profits in the year to March jumped from Pounds 58.9m to Pounds
76.2m on sales up 7 per cent at Pounds 415m.
Only Pounds 2.3m of profit contribution came from the acquisition last year
of Inter Innovation, its Swedish-based competitor.
Despite the jump in profits, De La Rue's share price fell 12p to 592p.
Earnings per share rose 17.7 per cent to 30.6p and the company is to
increase the full year dividend by 9.1 per cent to 15p.
After a year of strong cash flow from operations, De La Rue's year-end net
cash rose to Pounds 112m and led to interest earned of Pounds 3.9m, compared
with an interest charge of Pounds 2.1m.
The group was left with Pounds 51m from the Pounds 162m rights issue after
the acquisition of Inter Innovation and an increase in the stake in Garny,
the German manufacturer of banking automation and physical security
equipment.
Mr Jeremy Marshall, chief executive, emphasised that De La Rue was
interested in further acquisitions but was in no hurry and would not buy
anything that would dilute earnings.
The security printing division increased operating profit by 21 per cent to
Pounds 41.7m.
While the comparable figure last year was depressed by an exceptional charge
and above the line rationalisation costs, the division benefited from
increased productivity.
Volumes in traditional markets fell by 4 per cent. Sales would have fallen
further but for new markets that are opening in the Baltics, the
Commonwealth of Independent States and in Africa.
De La Rue has a 60 per cent market share of the 120 large countries that do
not print their own notes but Mr Marshall recognises the market is
relatively mature.
The acquisition of Inter Innovation would, however, make De La Rue's payment
Systems sector of equal importance within the group in terms of sales but
was an area of greater growth potential.
With only four months of the new acquisition, the division increased
operating profit by 41.2 per cent to Pounds 23.3m on a similar increase in
sales. Sales at Garny, where De La Rue now holds a 93 per cent stake,
increased by 48 per cent.

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Leigh blames recession for 5% fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEIGH INTERESTS, the waste management company, blamed low levels of waste
production in the south of England for a 5 per cent fall in profits for the
year to March 31.
Despite two acquisitions, pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 14.8m to Pounds
14.1m on sales up 23 per cent at Pounds 118.8m.
Earnings per share fell from 18p to 15.5p but the company is recommending
the payment of a final dividend of 5.37p, giving a total of 7.83p, compared
with 7.64p.
Mr Malcolm Wood, chairman, said signs of the recession continued in the
south of England where waste volumes generated and handled were lower than
at the same time last year.
The company had responded by cutting back the relevant operations.
At an operating level profits advanced by 24 per cent to Pounds 17m, helped
by the acquisitions. However, an interest charge of Pounds 2.93m compared
with interest earned last year of Pounds 982,000 led to the fall in pre-tax
profits.
The company had decided to take advantage of low asset prices by spending
Pounds 23.1m to buy the Gerrards Cross Waste Disposal Company, operating
near the junction of the M40 and the M25, and Ideal Aggregates, which has
its biggest landfill asset near Rugby.
These acquisitions took gearing to 50 per cent, a level which the company
said it expects to persist through this year.
The company is about to commission the UK's first wet-air oxidation plant in
Birmingham which will treat aqueous organic waste without resorting to
expensive incineration.

<TEXT>
ALLIED COLLOIDS, the speciality chemicals company, reported an 8 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 38.8m to Pounds 42.1m, for the year
to March 28.
Although the figure was below market expectations the company issued an
upbeat statement about prospects and raised the final dividend to 3.02p
(2.7p) making a total of 3.9p compared with 3.5p.
While turnover in the first half was in line with expectations, sales in the
second half remained flat, reflecting the continuing recession across both
sides of the Atlantic.
Overall sales, however, rose by 9 per cent, from Pounds 232.9m to Pounds
254.5m, reflecting the group's lack of dependence on the UK market which
accounted for just 15 per cent of turnover.
Earnings increased from 9.88p to 12.3p, mainly as a result of an exceptional
tax credit.
The tax charge of Pounds 10.1m was exceptionally low because a provision for
deferred taxation of Pounds 5m relating to accelerated capital allowances
was considered no longer to be required.
Net assets increased from Pounds 130m to Pounds 145m, while gearing remained
low at 4.5 per cent.

FT  03 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Inquiry takes toll on Eurocopy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROCOPY, the photocopier distributor, yesterday blamed the effects of a
government inquiry into the selling practices of some of its subsidiaries
for an 80 per cent decline in interim profits.
The company - which was allowed to retain its consumer credit licences in
January following a six-month investigation by the OFT - suffered a decline
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.66m to Pounds 720,000 for the six months to
March 31. Sales fell by 4.5 per cent to Pounds 18.4m (Pounds 19.3m).
Mr Michael Armitage, finance director, said Eurocopy's competition had had
'a field day' during the inquiry, exploiting doubts prompted by the
investigation. However, such practices had stopped since the OFT's
announcement.
The difficulty now was recession, he said. Eurocopy had seen no sign of a
sustained upturn in the second half. Nevertheless, the uncovered dividend is
held at 1.1p on the premise that the first half - disrupted by the inquiry
and the election - had not been representative of normal trading patterns.
The final pay-out, however, depended on a 'sustained recovery coming
through'.
The greatest decline came in machine sales, where gross margins plunged from
50 to 12 per cent, and the operating loss almost doubled to Pounds 2.5m
(Pounds 1.3m).
Profits from servicing fell from Pounds 4.5m to Pounds 3.6m. The furniture
business - acquired with Equipu in 1989 - incurred a Pounds 500,000 loss
(breakeven).
Earnings per share fell from 5.01p to 1p.
Mr Armitage said the company was about to issue a writ claiming Pounds 9.2m
from Sketchley over the Equipu purchase. Companies acquired in the
transaction were at the root of claims about misleading practices which led
to the OFT inquiry.
Mr Cyril Gay, the chairman, said that overhead costs had been kept under
constant review and savings had been made which would reduce annual service
department and administrative costs by Pounds 1m. He said those savings
would start to come through in the second half.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Rolls-Royce enters the power league: Paul Betts looks at the
partnership with Westinghouse to challenge General Electric
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE has decided to play with the big boys in the fiercely
competitive industrial power generation market by agreeing to form a 15-year
partnership with Westinghouse of the US.
'The arrangement with Westinghouse takes us into the world market,' Mr Terry
Harrison, head of Rolls-Royce's industrial power activities, said yesterday.
He becomes the company's chief executive at the end of September.
The deal - which will also link Rolls-Royce to Westinghouse partners such as
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries of Japan and FiatAvio of Italy - will again
pitch the UK group against General Electric, its American arch-rival in the
aero-engine business and the power generation world market leader.
For Westinghouse - whose traditional role as the industry's number two after
GE has been eroded with the decline of nuclear power programmes - the
alliance will strengthen its hand in its leadership battle with GE.
Westinghouse's power business had total sales of Dollars 2.6bn (Pounds
1.44bn) last year and made an operating profit of Dollars 283m.
Surplus capacity and the gradual breakdown of protected national power plant
markets has accelerated consolidation and cross-border partnerships in the
power generation industry.
Power plant manufacturers have faced a fundamental choice in order to
survive: they can either opt to collaborate in large technologically
powerful alliances operating over the full range of power generation
products; or they can become smaller 'niche' players specialising in a
particular market sector.
'We've clearly gone for the broad alliance,' said Mr Harrison, the former
chief executive of Northern Engineering Industries (NEI), the UK power
equipment supplier acquired three years ago by Rolls-Royce.
Even before its acquisition, NEI was looking for partners. It forged an
alliance initially with Mitsubishi. This collapsed after the Rolls-Royce
merger because the aero-engine maker had a separate agreement with the
Swedish-Swiss Asea Brown Boveri group. After the merger, NEI and ABB formed
a joint venture to sell power plants in the UK.
Originally Rolls-Royce decided to acquire NEI in order to increase its
presence in the industrial power business and help broaden its industrial
base. It is far more heavily dependent on the aero-engine sector than its
two main US competitors, GE and Pratt &amp; Whitney, both of which are part of
much larger diversified groups.
The strategy helped Rolls-Royce ride through the current cyclical slump in
the commercial aero-engine market and the decline in military aero-engine
activity. Industrial power accounted for 42 per cent of the company's Pounds
3.5bn sales last year and made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 73m compared with
a Pounds 6m loss by the aerospace division.
But to make headway in the world market and increase the industrial power
group's share of turnover to 50 per cent, Rolls-Royce decided it needed to
forge a partnership.
GE already has a wide range of partners, from GEC/Alsthom in Europe to
Toshiba and Hitachi in Japan. Siemens of Germany has links with Pratt &amp;
Whitney, while ABB acquired the US boiler maker Combustion Engineering and
the power generation interests of Ansaldo and Franco Tosi of Italy.
Westinghouse has formed a trilateral alliance with Mitsubishi and FiatAvio
but was looking for a technological partner to provide it with the
aero-engine technology it lacked compared with GE, which has its own
extensive aero-engine activities.
'The attraction of Rolls-Royce for Westinghouse was our aero-engine
technology while they offered us an opportunity to get into the
international marketplace,' Mr Harrison said.
The power industry expects most of the near-term growth in the market to
come from natural gas-fired combustion turbine or combined cycle plants.
This has brought aero-engine and industrial power plant manufacturers closer
because gas turbines for power generation are derived from aircraft engine
technology.
The availability of much cheaper natural gas, the greater thermal efficiency
of combined cycle plants, their environmental advantages, their lower and
much faster installation costs have significantly boosted demand for gas
turbines in electricity generation, Mr Harrison explained. 'The hotter you
run a gas turbine, the more efficient it is. And you need aero-technology to
do that,' he said.
Westinghouse and Rolls-Royce started working together last year when they
jointly bid for a US government contract to develop a new gas turbine engine
for the US Navy. After winning the Dollars 160m contract in January, the two
companies decided to expand their relationship into a much broader
technology transfer and marketing alliance.
'One thing led to the other,' said Mr Harrison, who also expects to see the
partnership offer Rolls-Royce additional opportunities to co-operate with
Westinghouse in related sectors like coal gasification.
The arrangement, he emphasised, would not affect NEI's existing venture with
ABB, which was restricted to the UK market, while the Westinghouse deal
covered all other world markets. Mr Harrison also said the new partnership
would not have any impact on Rolls-Royce's venture with Cooper Industries of
the US in pumping machinery for the oil and gas industry and offshore power
generation.
Mr Harrison conceded it would take some time before the Westinghouse
agreement would reap tangible results. 'There are no miracles in the heavy
engineering business but the arrangement will have very significant payoffs
for all the partners in due course,' he said.
It has, however, already had one immediate effect. It has enabled the
combined forces of Westinghouse and Rolls-Royce to throw down the gauntlet
to their common enemy GE.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Thames Water profits rise 11%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAMES WATER, Britain's largest water company by number of customers,
yesterday announced modest increases in profits and dividends and defused
potential criticism about directors' salaries with a 10 per cent cut in pay
and bonuses.
Thames reported an 11.3 per cent increase in pre-tax profits from Pounds
212.3m to Pounds 236.3m in the year to March 31.
The increase was due to price rises and cost-cutting, but was held back
slightly by interest payments and recession.
Mr Roy Watts, chairman, said the performance was 'highly creditable'.
However, he said the results did not meet targets set by the non-executive
directors and directors' pay and bonuses would be about 10 per cent below
last year's total of Pounds 847,000, itself a 70 per cent increase on the
previous period.
Turnover increased 7.6 per cent to Pounds 899.3m. Turnover in the core water
and sewage businesses increased 11.5 per cent, in spite of price rises of
12.2 per cent. The slight shortfall was due to lower measured water usage
from recession-affected industrial users.
Operating profits increased 23.8 per cent to Pounds 234m. Profits from
property disposals were unchanged at Pounds 11m.
Interest costs were Pounds 9m, compared with interest earnings of Pounds
12m, as Thames launched a borrowing programme to fund capital investment of
about Pounds 4bn.
Net borrowings increased to Pounds 327m from Pounds 88m and took gearing to
21 per cent from 6 per cent. Capital investment, which includes the London
ring main, increased 4.1 per cent to Pounds 409m.
Earnings per share increased 9.4 per cent to 54.8p. The company is
recommending a final dividend of 12.8p (against 11.5p) to make a total of
19.2p, an increase of 9.7 per cent. The results were in line with market
expectations, and followed a 4 per cent increase in interim profits to
Pounds 118m.
Mr David Luffrum, group finance director, said Thames' non-core,
non-regulated businesses had annualised turnover of Pounds 250m and the
company had spent Pounds 90m on acquisitions since privatisation.
UTAG, the east German contracting and consultancy acquired in January, was
not consolidated in Thames' results.
Thames shares fell 1p to 444p.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Rescue moves seen to ease mortgage crisis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PHILIP STEPHENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of house reposses-sions is expected to fall sharply this year as
a result of lenders' initiatives introduced six months ago, but the
suspension on stamp duty will not be extended, the government said
yesterday.
At a meeting with representatives of the Council of Mortgage Lenders, Mr
Norman Lamont, the chancellor, said he was encouraged by the progress
lenders had made in reducing the level of house repossessions.
After the meeting - called to review the housing rescue scheme set up to try
to ease the problem of repossessions - Mr Mark Boleat, director-general of
the council, said the underlying position regarding rents and arrears had
not improved.
'However, lenders are confident that the measures they have taken, in
particular greater counselling of borrowers and restructuring of loan
arrangements, will lead to a significant reduction in possessions compared
with the peak figures recorded in the middle of last year,' said Mr Boleat.
The chancellor rejected calls from the building societies to extend the
suspension of stamp duty on house purchases, due to expire on August 19.
Under the initiatives, the building societies pledged more than Pounds 800m
for mortgage-rescue schemes, intended to save at least 16,000 borrowers from
eviction. The schemes included a less aggressive approach to repossession
and a mortgage-to-rent scheme whereby housing associations would buy homes
about to be repossessed and rent them back to their former owners.
In return the government agreed to pay social security benefits to cover
mortgage interest direct to the lenders.
Most societies have achieved a significant reduction in the number of
evictions by improved debt counselling and similar services. But the council
said yesterday that mortgage-to-rent schemes had proved very complicated and
that most homeowners in difficulties were not interested in such schemes,
preferring to remain in their homes as owner-occupiers with loan terms.
During the meeting the council told Mr Lamont that, on previous trends, the
number of repossessions would have risen by 120,000 this year, but the
combination of lenders' initiatives and the direct payment of DSS benefits
to the lenders would reduce the number to about 65,000.
Treasury officials said the government had ruled out an extension to the
stamp duty 'holiday' well in advance of yesterday's meeting. They said such
a move would undermine the purpose of the original decision, which was to
encourage prospective buyers to bring forward their purchases.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Howard says at least 2,000 DoE staff will relocate to
Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday hardened its commitment to relocate at least 2,000
civil servants in Docklands as ministers sought to give a breathing space
for the administrators of the failed Canary Wharf development.
Separately, Ernst &amp; Young, the administrators, made 44 of Canary Wharf's 198
office staff redundant. They said further redundancies among office staff
would follow 'as certain of the group's activities are completed'. Most of
the 218 estate management staff at Canary Wharf will keep their jobs, they
said. 'The joint administrators do not envisage any material reductions to
these employees as they wish to maintain the full services to existing
tenants.'
In the House of Commons, Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary, said
Canary Wharf was among three sites under study for the move by civil
servants from the Department of the Environment. The others were Harbour
Exchange and East India Dock, both on the Isle of Dogs.
Mr Howard said he expected to conclude soon an outline deal to lease space
at one of the sites. Officials said a decision was likely before the end of
this month. He repeated that there could be no subsidy, 'hidden or
otherwise', in the deal. He also said the government would go ahead with the
extension of the Jubilee line only if the owners of Canary Wharf contributed
the Pounds 400m agreed previously by Olympia &amp; York.
Ministerial colleagues said Mr Howard's announcement - which included
details of a prospective move of another few hundred civil servants from the
Department of Trade and Industry - was designed to emphasise the
government's confidence in Docklands. That in turn should help give the
administrators of Canary Wharf a breathing space in their efforts to salvage
the project.
The environment secretary repeated that the government would not intervene
directly in any rescue operation. But Lord Wakeham, the Lord Privy Seal, is
understood to be in active contact with potential purchasers of Canary
Wharf.
Mr Howard said the move by his staff and the DTI's Radio Communications
Agency could be followed in the longer term by the relocation of civil
servants from other departments.
He also signalled he was in discussions with the Treasury on possible
compensation - perhaps travel allowances or relocation expenses - for civil
servants affected by the move.
One minister involved in the negotiations said the high quality of
accommodation available at Canary Wharf made it a frontrunner. The
government would have to satisfy the National Audit Office that it was the
best value for money.
Mr Howard, who faced pressure from some Conservative MPs to confirm that the
government would go ahead with the Jubilee line extension, said he was
confident that the owners of Canary Wharf would come up with the agreed
contribution.
The maintenance of Canary Wharf will be discussed this week at meetings
between individual tenants and the administrators. The tenants will also
seek assurances about the security of the project and the payment of rent on
former properties, one of O&amp;Y's inducements for them to move to Canary
Wharf.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Foreign Affairs: How to pay for eco-virtue - Freer trade
would help to finance the agenda of the Earth Summit, which opens today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Seldom can a meeting have been so long or intensively prepared as the United
Nations Conference on Environment and Development, alias the Earth Summit,
alias Eco 92, which opens today in Rio de Janeiro. Seldom can any conference
have been set so momentous a task. And seldom can expectations have been so
bleakly and ruthlessly lowered. One could almost say that, since everyone
now expects to be disappointed, no-one will be.
Mr George Bush, 'the environment president', has no doubt done most to lower
expectations by negotiating the draft treaty on global warming down to
meaninglessness, and by serving notice that he will not sign the one on
biodiversity, which he considers 'seriously flawed'.
Yet, in a different way, those with a genuine interest in a successful
outcome have also played their part. Environmental groups have done their
best to make the public aware of the enormous gap between what they believe
needs to be done to 'save the planet' and what is likely to be agreed.
Similarly, developing countries have tried to keep the focus on the gap
between the dire needs of their populations and the meagre level of
assistance that industrialised countries are likely to offer.
Some developing countries, it seems, have also conspired with the Vatican to
prevent the population issue from being given the central place on the
agenda which both environmentalists and many development economists believe
it should have.
This point has attracted the special wrath of Mr Helmut Schmidt, the former
German chancellor. Last week in Queretaro, Mexico, I heard him deliver a
veritable philippic on the subject. The preparatory material for Rio, he
said, 'pretends there could be sustainable development and environmental
preservation without limitations of the population explosion', thereby
making a mockery of the whole concept of sustainability. At the same time,
the industrial countries, led by the US, were refusing to commit themselves
to limit carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gas emissions 'in concrete
figures of a clearly defined period and in a mandatory language', while the
draft document 'Agenda 21' suggested 'unrealistic levels of financial
resources to implement various environment programmes'. The effect would be
to turn the conference 'into a bargaining exercise between two partners who
were sitting in the same sinking boat, and threatening each other to open up
the leaks on their respective side of the boat even more widely if the other
does not start to shut the leaks on his side first'.
Mr Schmidt's audience included a galaxy of other former heads of state or
government from all parts of the world. These people form a select club
called the InterAction Council, under Mr Schmidt's chairmanship, which seeks
to distill their collective elder statesmanly wisdom for the benefit of
their successors and the world at large.
Inevitably, much of last week's discussion focused on the Rio agenda. Not
surprisingly, Mr Schmidt failed to enlist his Latin American colleagues in
an all-out attack on the Vatican. Nor were there many takers for his
proposal that official development aid (ODA) should be 'made conditional on
dependable family planning programmes'. This was partly because it seemed
impossible to draw up clear criteria, but more fundamentally because many
people felt the issue had a chicken-and-egg quality: while population growth
is undoubtedly holding back economic development in many countries, lack of
economic development is probably keeping birthrates high.
Mr Schmidt did get his colleagues to agree to a final statement which
deplores that 'the overarching population issue is not given the place it
deserves on the summit agenda', and states bluntly that 'each developing
country must:
ensure access to birth control, education and services and to voluntary
methods of contraception;
extend education of all young people to the age of 14-16;
place greater emphasis on women's rights and their employment opportunities
and improve basic health care services.'
And, switching the aid conditionality into a positive mode, it adds that
'where developing countries give priority to family planning within their
own budgetary resources, the industrialised countries for their part should
provide substantial additional assistance'.
But where is additional assistance going to come from? That question hangs
not only over the population problem but over the entire Rio agenda. The
Queretaro meeting had before it the report of a 'high-level group', also
chaired by Mr Schmidt, which pointed out that industrialised countries face
'substantial new claims for enormous financial resources, in particular
related to environmental protection, development assistance, eastern
European reconstruction and decommissioning of nuclear weapons' at a time
when, if anything, the savings ratio of those same countries is shrinking.
'It is,' the report adds drily, 'a matter of grave concern that the largest
economy of the world (the US) has for several years engaged in a policy of
dissaving financed by the rest of the world'.
Thus the Queretaro meeting concluded that 'major industrialised countries
should pursue policies to increase public savings dramatically. National
political agendas have to be changed towards sustained growth plus higher
rates of savings. . . . Germany must restore its status as a capital
exporter. . . . The US must tackle its deficits and reverse its growing
indebtedness.'
The more one thinks about it, the clearer it is that the financial resources
so badly needed are not going to be available unless there is rapid economic
growth throughout the world, and that the only stimulus likely to accelerate
world growth is expanding world trade. This point was made at Queretaro by
Mr Andries van Agt, the former Dutch prime minister who represents the EC in
Washington.
He quoted a report recently published by the OECD Development Centre
according to which a successful conclusion of the Uruguay Round would
unleash some Dollars 200bn in annual world income, of which some Dollars
90bn would accrue to developing and former communist countries. 'Whereas,'
he added, 'dismantling all trade barriers would raise world income by close
to Dollars 500bn annually - about half the income of the less developed
economies or, in other words, the income of 3bn people.'
The trouble is that things are moving in the opposite direction. Twenty out
of the 24 OECD countries, we were told, have become more protectionist in
the last five to 10 years - including notably the US and the EC. And Mr van
Agt, fresh from the latest round of EC-US negotiations, said the Uruguay
Round 'is still in danger of collapsing'.
None of these thoughts is exactly new, and the political difficulties of
acting on them remain as formidable as ever. But it is boringly true that
the fate of the world's ecology, and of the 1bn people who already live in
absolute poverty, depend more on industrial countries dismantling trade
barriers and stimulating savings than they do on any of the specific
decisions they are being asked to take in Rio.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Letter: Protection of database copyright
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Prof CHARLES OPPENHEIM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Celia Hampton (Business Law, May 28) has constructed an argument
against the European Community's draft directive on database copyright based
on a misapprehension of the nature of electronic databases. She claims that
databases 'normally include all the information on a given subject'. That is
true for only a small minority of databases - such as telephone numbers and
share prices, which she cites as examples. The vast majority of databases
involve value added by the database producer, which either codes and
indexes, produces brief abstracts, or selects from the mass of information
only those items of relevance.
These are the features which make electronic databases valuable to clients.
For the vast majority of databases, therefore, there has indeed been
intellectual effort in their selection and arrangement, and therefore under
the proposed EC directive they will be subject to copyright protection.
It may well be that the proposed directive poses potential harm to BT's
copyright on telephone directories; but for the majority of the electronic
information industry the proposals regarding copyright are non-contentious.
What is contentious is the proposal for compulsory licensing, an issue which
Celia Hampton surprisingly did not address. Charles Oppenheim,

FT  03 JUN 92 / Letter: Debt owed to Troubleshooter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr BRIAN WARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, It was perhaps inevitable that a post-mortem would be done on the
Troubleshooter companies (Management: 'Toil and trouble', June 1); and
equally inevitable, so-and-so's law being what it is, that it should
coincide with the nadir of the recession.
However, in the original programme there was something missing from Sir John
Harvey-Jones's otherwise excellent dissections of the companies concerned,
which left one with an uneasy feeling that, while, for instance, the 'human'
side was marvellously covered, hard, intuitive gut-feel for the
all-important financial aspects of running a business was less in evidence.
Which is perhaps why the outcome, two years later, is what it is.
If Sir John's prime aim was to make business, in the common perception,
generally more acceptable then he succeeded beyond all expectations; the
programmes are still being talked about and a considerable debt of gratitude
is due to him on that account alone.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MARK LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Actuaries must take an extremely long-term view of the future (Lex:
'Pensions', June 1) when making projections of pension fund liabilities -
eg, the final payments made in respect of a 30-year-old employee may be more
than 60 years hence. However, they will be influenced by the views of
clients - trustees and sponsors of the pensions schemes.
It is the actuary's responsibility to explain why he or she proposes to use
a certain set of actuarial assumptions about the future, and also to allow
for the client to have input on these assumptions. The client's views are
likely to be shorter term, but if the actuary, in his judgment, finds them
acceptable then he will adjust his assumptions  - provided that the client
is made aware of the implications of those changes.
A current example of this is the implications of the exchange rate mechanism
and the consequences for future inflation/interest rates - to what extent
should the actuary take this into account given the short-term nature of
political policies?

FT  03 JUN 92 / Leading Article: A long road to Whitehall reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major's government should be judged by its success in raising the
quality of public services to the highest possible standard, according to Mr
William Waldegrave, the newly-appointed minister of public service. In a
speech on Monday, he reaffirmed the government's commitment to the Citizen's
Charter, Mr Major's programme for making public services more responsive to
their customers. And he promised radical steps to modernise further the
civil service, which continues to play a significant role in the provision
of public services.
This renewed priority for civil service reform is both welcome and
necessary. Welcome because the government has often seemed less concerned
with efficiency in the civil service than in local government and the health
service which are not under its direct control. Necessary because changing
the culture of the civil service requires permanent revolution to overcome
the inertia inherent in an organisation of such a scale.
Much has already been achieved, though the effects can often take years to
be felt. The Financial Management Initiative, for example, was launched in
1982 to delegate control of departmental budgets to line managers who were
given responsibility for cost centres. Its progress was judged disappointing
at the time, but the initiative planted the seeds of an idea which has begun
to flower. Departments have now developed internal trading accounts to
allocate costs and allow more rigorous financial management.
One consequence of this improvement in internal accounting has been a
renewed wave of civil service relocation away from central London.
Departments have - often for the first time - become strikingly aware of the
real costs of their establishments in London and acted accordingly.
Competitive tendering
A second consequence is the greater transparency of costs which now makes
possible the extension of contracting-out to central government departments.
This move is long overdue - even Labour council leaders such as Newcastle's
Mr Jeremy Beecham now affirm the virtues of compulsory competitive tendering
in local government. Mr Waldegrave must show that the government means
business on contracting-out with early tendering for a substantial slice of
civil service tasks.
The creation of executive agencies to deliver government services such as
benefits payments and vehicle licensing has also been slow to realise its
potential. More than 70 agencies have been set up, employing over half of
all civil servants. This has broken the civil service into more manageable
units organised around discrete tasks and headed by an accountable chief
executive.
Greater efficiency
But there has been too little progress in exploiting the scope for greater
efficiency which is now possible. For example, a report last year by Sir
Angus Fraser, then efficiency adviser to the government, criticised
excessive interference in agencies by departments and the Treasury. He
recommended cuts of at least 25 per cent in the Whitehall staff overseeing
agencies - no doubt one reason why the report appears to have been buried.
And only one agency, Her Majesty's Stationery Office, has broken away from
nationally determined civil service pay and grading. The pay of property
valuers in Liverpool and vehicle testers in Leeds are determined by annual
negotiations in London. Mr Waldegrave last week urged agency chiefs to make
more local pay deals - rightly, since it is clearly more cost-effective for
pay to reflect the labour markets in which agencies operate.
Finally, the Citizen's Charter will need much more muscle if consumers are
to be given real power to demand better public services and to enforce
standards. Some charters have offered more impressive performance targets
than others. And the remedies for disgruntled consumers are often far from
the simple and effective means of redress promised by the prime minister.
Mr Waldegrave has, therefore, much to do to achieve his aim of standards of
excellence in public services equal to those of the best private companies.
He will need to turn a sceptical ear towards some of the reservations so
skilfully expressed in Whitehall.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Personal View: In a muddle on training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN CASSELS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Education and training for 16- to 18-year-olds is in a mess. Everybody is
agreed - the Confederation of British Industry, the Trades Union Congress
and government included - that all young people should continue formal
learning until at least 18, but that remains a remote target.
A recently published briefing for the National Commission on Education by Mr
David Raffe shows that in 1990 only 37 per cent of 16- to 18-year-olds in
the UK were in full-time education. Of the remaining 63 per cent only 15 per
cent were in Youth Training and the rest - almost half - were in an 'others'
category, with only a minority receiving any part-time education.
We lag badly behind other countries in the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development. Mr Raffe says that the UK had the lowest
full-time participation rate among 16- to 18-year-olds in 1986: its rate was
then 33 per cent, half the average for the other 12 OECD countries. If
part-time provision is included, our rate at 64 per cent was much closer to
the average for the other 12 of 75 per cent; but given the uncertain quality
of our part-time provision, we can take little comfort from that.
Our poor performance is sometimes held to show that we have a cultural block
that prevents us doing better, or that employers, who are supposed to be
responsible for training, are incurably short-sighted. In fact our real
ailment seems to be muddle-headedness. We do not make it easy for people to
behave sensibly. Clear our heads a bit, and things could improve.
Four areas need attention:
Responsibility. There is a conflict between the interests of employers,
which are bound to be fairly short-term, and the needs of young people,
which stretch more than 40 years ahead. It is reasonable to expect employers
to provide training related to the job; but further education is also
needed, and should be provided by colleges or other providers at public
expense - as in full-time education. Costs. Making it clear that it is not
the employer's responsibility to provide further education makes it easier
to return to the financial basis of all successful apprentice systems: that
the net cost to an employer of each apprentice is broadly neutral. The cost
of pay plus the cost of training is balanced by the value of the
apprentice's output. If you achieve that, there need be no limit to
employers' willingness to provide training places. Incentives. Why should
young people be prepared to train for qualifications if employers do not
show that they value them? Pay structures must be overhauled, first to
reduce the pay of trainees in recognition of the costs that employers incur
in training them, of their absence one day a week or more at college and of
their comparatively low output, and second to increase the pay of employees
who have acquired relevant qualifications.
Traineeships. Experience shows that there need to be formal 'traineeships'
signed by employer and trainee (and perhaps a parent); they must be seen to
lead to recognised qualifications, now made possible by the NVQs introduced
by the National Council for Vocational Qualifications; and there must be
proper inspection to establish and maintain standards.
Get these things right and the upshot should be traineeships of good quality
for all 16- and 17-year-olds entering the labour market. Young people will
get a lasting benefit; employers should be delighted, so too should the
trade unions. And the government should be pleased because youth
unemployment will dwindle - a result achieved at much less expense to the
taxpayer than the current arrangements, which do not work.
But there are a couple of snags. One is that employers often attract 16- and
17-year-olds into jobs with no training but quite high pay. That is one
reason that the UK's staying-on rate in full-time education is so low. We
probably need legislation obliging any employer who wants to employ a 16- or
17-year-old in a regular full-time job to provide him or her with a
traineeship.
The other snag is that the pay of most young people in work is based on the
presumption that they are fully productive workers - not surprisingly, since
that has been the reality in most cases - and not trainees. For a trainee,
the example of German apprentices suggests that a starting at 30 per cent of
the adult rate would be about right. But it would not be easy for any
individual employer to move to that level of pay on his own initiative.
Either there needs to be a concerted movement by leading employers or, if
that proves impossible to arrange, legislation needs to step in here too,
providing for a statutory body to determine the wages of young people in
traineeships.
Negotiating these snags may seem tricky, even formidable, but the stakes are
high. Do nothing and we are set for continuing failure, whereas the prize
for success is immensely valuable.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Of mice, men and money: Legal action over patent disputes
threatens to stifle investment in biotechnology, write Clive Cookson and
Julie Clayton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON and JULIE CLAYTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The patent system, designed to nurture innovation, is in danger of
strangling the world's biotechnology companies just as they are set to
emerge from a long gestation period and grow into a multi-billion dollar
global industry.
While scientists discover new genes and create novel forms of life, rivalry
is intensifying over who should 'own' and profit from their achievements.
The explosive growth of biotechnology, combined with the multifaceted nature
of its new products, means that each one encompasses several recent
inventions. This makes it increasingly difficult to assess patent claims in
time to prevent conflict. And most biotech managers come from the
patent-dominated pharmaceutical business, so their instinct is to fight
tenaciously for any possible claims. As a result, biotechnology devotes
proportionally more time and money to patent protection than any other
industry.
To give one example, Celltech of the UK spends Pounds 600,000 a year on
filing and maintaining patents - compared with Pounds 10m on research and
development, the company's main activity. Total worldwide spending on
biotechnology patents probably exceeds Dollars 100m (Pounds 55.5m) a year.
At the same time, biotech patenting is raising a cloud of difficult social
and ethical issues, especially in Europe. Should anyone 'own' a piece of
natural genetic material? A new type of animal? Part of the human body?
This month the European Patent Office in Munich formally granted its first
patent for a transgenic animal, Harvard University's 'onco-mouse'. The
animal, designed for cancer research, is genetically engineered to develop
tumours under certain conditions.
The patent office justified the decision on the grounds that the fight
against cancer was 'of paramount importance for the welfare of mankind';
this outweighed the possible suffering of the mice. But opponents of the
decision plan to contest the patent and Dr Paul Braendli, European Patent
Office president, believes the case will not be resolved for some years.
At the same time the European Commission and European Parliament are
battling over a draft directive that will lay down the future rules for
biotechnology patents in the EC. They are being lobbied from one side by
Patent Concern, a coalition of environmental, development and animal welfare
groups, which is calling for a moratorium on patenting any form of life. On
the other side, the industry is pressing for clear guidelines that will
enable it to patent genetically engineered animals and plants.
Tomorrow the issue reaches the annual meeting of UK Women's Institutes,
which will debate a resolution calling for the EC draft directive to be
rejected.
Patent paranoia in the biotech industry has been heightened further by the
US National Institutes of Health, which recently filed almost 3,000 patent
applications for fragments of human genes, without knowing what they do in
the body. The NIH action - taken with the approval of the US government -
has been condemned by scientists worldwide. They say patents should be
reserved for individual genes the uses of which are specified.
The UK Medical Research Council joined in the chorus of criticism - and then
said it would reluctantly follow the example of its US counterpart, to
protect the UK position. So the MRC is preparing to file patents for almost
2,000 gene fragments of its own.
The biotechnology industry is praying that the US Patent Office will throw
out the NIH and MRC applications because they fail the 'utility' test. But
the US is so liberal in its interpretation of what makes a valid patent that
it would be unwise to count on the claims being rejected.
Dr David Owen, the MRC's industrial collaboration director, believes the
attempt to patent gene fragments highlights a wider crisis over intellectual
property. 'What concerns me is that we are moving into a world where more
and more marginal inventions are being patented. That devalues the currency
of patents - to the point where the patent system might become a
disincentive, an obstacle to progress.'
Companies wishing to sell new gene-based drugs have to negotiate with an
increasing number of other companies and research institutions. Each lays
claim to a piece of the intellectual property involved in the development. A
typical product launched in the mid-1990s could require royalty payments to
as many as a dozen licensees.
The chain would start with the master patent for recombinant DNA technology,
the technique underlying all genetic engineering, which earned Dollars 17m
in royalties for Stanford University and the University of California last
year. It might also encompass broad patents for other 'enabling
technologies' and very narrow patents for specific genes.
Each royalty claim might seem reasonable in isolation, says Dr Owen, 'but
taken together they can destroy a business opportunity'.
A severe backlog in the number of applications waiting to be processed is
adding to the confusion. In 1990, for example, 8,200 biotech applications
remained unexamined at the US Patent Office. Claims often overlap with each
other and they contain increasingly complex details. Most biotechnology
patents take three to five years to process - longer than any other type.
Companies suffer because they have to start marketing before patent disputes
are settled. Genetics Institute (GI), for example, faces heavy losses to
Amgen over the right to make and sell a blood-boosting drug called
erythropoietin (EPO).
The two companies developed different versions of EPO and applied for
patents. Both made licensing and marketing arrangements and their patents
were awarded in 1987. While Amgen received Food and Drug Administration
approval to use EPO to treat anaemia in 1989, April 1991 Amgen successfully
persuaded the US Court of Appeals that GI was guilty of patent infringement
and should be barred from the US market.
Amgen is now seeking more than Dollars 11m in damages. To rub salt into GI's
wound, EPO is now the world's best selling biotech product, having earned
Amgen an estimated Dollars 300m in 1990 alone.
A potent illustration of the nightmare facing the industry is conflict over
a powerful new technique for detecting genetic mutations, called the ligase
chain reaction. LCR promises to be an accurate, automated clinical test for
genetic diseases and cancer.
The first LCR-related patent was awarded in 1989 to Applied Biosystems Inc.
ABI will be targeting prenatal diagnosis and carrier screening, but it faces
tough opposition.
Abbott Laboratories and its sister company, Omnigene, have 'numerous pending
applications' for their own versions of LCR. They are planning a unified
assault on a range of problems in clinical diagnostics, agriculture, food
and the environment, according to Dr Keith Backman, senior scientist at
Omnigene. 'There's a lot of hoopla out there. Some of these people are going
to be very disappointed,' he warns.
Several other rivals have filed patent claims for LCR, including Beckman
Research Institute, Salk Institute and California Institute of Technology.
Some contenders are more optimistic than others that disaster can be averted
by arbitration. 'I'm sure we'll all figure out in the end how to get along,'
says Mr Joseph Smith, patent counsel for ABI. 'My guess is that this field
is big enough for lots of people.'
Most recently, Cornell University entered the arena with a 'multiplicity of
claims' for the work of Dr Francis Barany, associate professor of
microbiology. Last year he discovered the information needed to mass-produce
an essential component of LCR, a protein called ligase.
'The whole patenting process hurts industry and creates uncertainty. It
makes it difficult to make marketing plans,' says Mr Walter Haussler,
Cornell's lawyer. 'As if in a game of poker, the question is: who will be
left holding the cards at the end of the game?'
In case Cornell fails to win a full hand, the university negotiated product
licences with two companies which specify that ligase be sold 'for research
purposes only, not commercial diagnosis'. Then, as the remaining
responsibility for LCR diagnostic kits seemed too hot to handle, Cornell
passed 'the whole ball of wax' to ABI as an exclusive licensing agreement.
The growing patent jungle in the US 'is definitely acting as a disincentive
to proper investment in biotechnology by European companies', says Mr John
Savin of the Centre for Exploitation of Science and Technology in London,
who is studying the commercialisation of gene research for a group of
European companies. 'US companies tend to use patents as part of the game -
they invest first and sort it out later.'
US biotechnology companies raised more than Dollars 1bn in public share
offerings last year. That was largely on the strength of their patented
research, since very few of the companies have products on the market. With
so much money behind them - and investor expectations so high - individual
companies are bound to defend their own patents ferociously, even if their
collective action is self-defeating for the industry as a whole.
'Patents are central to the future of the company,' says Dr Peter Fellner,
Celltech chief executive. 'I don't think people in our industry will
voluntarily self-regulate their patenting activity. But litigation and
licensing deals will eventually lead to a framework dictated by precedents
in the courts.'
Governments can help, by smoothing out international discrepancies in the
way patents are treated. Under the US system, the patent goes to whoever can
prove he or she first made the invention. This is more prone to litigation
than the clear-cut principle followed elsewhere: that the patent goes to the
person who files for it first.
Now US patent officials say they would be prepared to move from 'first to
invent' to 'first to file', as part of an international patent treaty. In
exchange Europe and Japan would give inventors a 'grace period' during which
they could discuss their inventions without losing all patent rights.
But if the biotechnology industry is really to blossom into a Dollars
50bn-a-year industry by the next century, as its backers expect, it will
have to sort out its own patent problems. Negotiation and compromise must
replace aggressive litigation.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Cajoling the former Soviets
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NO NEWS is bad news in the former Soviet Union. The lull in the storms of
the past year does not mean reforms are going well: it means they are
running into great difficulties, where they are still running at all.
Internal conflicts are the visible part. Russia and Ukraine dispute
ownership of Crimea with increasing bitterness: foreign leaders who listen
to the cases of both liken their rhetoric to that passing between Slovenia
and Serbia before the blood began to flow. It remains hard to imagine a war
between them, but easier to imagine lower-level fights.
Baltic-Russian relations are no healthier. Talks between these three states
and Russia on the pulling out of Russian troops have gone badly: the Baltic
states insist on rapid removal, but Russia says that it does not intend to
complete withdrawal until 1999.
Economic links between the republics and their enterprises continue to
weaken. This is partly due to a breakdown of the distribution and planning
mechanisms, which affects everyone: but it is also due to blockades,
embargoes and barriers deliberately erected by one state against others.
This short-term safeguarding of assets hurts everyone, and slows reform.
Or it would, if reform were happening. Only Russia and the Baltics have a
programme of economic reform - although Kazakhstan is trying to adopt a far
eastern model of a guided market economy. Russia's reform overshadows all
others, because of its size and its resources: here, there are distinct
signs of faltering. On a range of reforms - energy prices, privatisation,
rouble convertibility - the government has either delayed, or had delay
forced upon it by parliament or president.
Malign twist
The resignation on Monday of Mr Georgy Matiukhin, the chairman of the
Russian Central Bank, and his forecast yesterday that credit would now
explode, adds a malign twist. Mr Matiukhin was not an ideal chairman - but
he appears to have been forced out because of the right things he was doing,
not the wrong ones.
Yet Russia is ahead of most. Ukraine, the next largest state, is still at
the stage of talking. Some are not even that far. The composite picture is
of states struggling to come to terms with the collapse of the union - and
doing so, in many cases, by setting nationalist agendas above economic ones.
At the same time, most of them appeal for aid from abroad: many of them
criticise the major foreign countries for tardiness in providing the aid;
and all say that they are getting tired of answering questions put to them
by experts and officials - for no apparent return. Mr Yeltsin, meeting Mr
Jacques Delors, the European Community president, at the weekend, told him
that 'the people's patience has its limits'.
Convincing conditions
Mr Yeltsin should be told that foreign countries also have their limits,
even if they recognise that it will be hard for them to set convincing
conditions. As they gear up for the Group of Seven summit in Munich next
month, they do realise that, for states that have had 70 years of communism
and centuries of autocracy before that, reform is not a matter of a short
sharp shock. Shocks there will be, but they will take years.
Nevertheless, lines must be drawn. Assistance depends on the ability of the
former Soviet states to help themselves - in the first instance by reducing
the levels of hostility and tension between them; by observing the human
rights and border agreements they have signed within the context of the
Helsinki Process; and by keeping up the pace of economic reform, even if the
latter is necessarily flexible in the face of popular discontent. Without
privatisation and a credible commitment to monetary and fiscal control,
substantial levels of western assistance would offer little more than
complicity in disaster. Western investment would, in any case, not be
forthcoming.
The case for western assistance to Mr Yeltsin's government, in particular,
has to be more than that it is not Mr Gorbachev's. It is rather that it will
not act like Mr Gorbachev's. Thus the mooted return of Mr Gorbachev's
central banker would be a disturbing sign. The states of the west should
reconfirm their desire to pay part of the bill for reform; but also that it
is reform they will pay for, not its simulacrum.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Arts: Romeo and Juliet - Ballet
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Peter Wright has for some years hoped to present a staging of MacMillan's
Romeo and Juliet for his section of the Royal Ballet. The move to
Birmingham, which brought increased forces and stage potential, made this
hope a fact, and on Monday night Birmingham Royal Ballet showed us their own
Romeo. And perhaps because BRB is, in essence, an ensemble young in spirit
as in personnel, Sir Kenneth MacMillan has chosen a young talent to decorate
the production.
Last year he saw the graduate show of the Wimbledon College of Art stage
design course, and was impressed by the work of Paul Andrews. So, at the age
of 22, Mr Andrews found himself entrusted with a three act ballet as his
first professional commission. The decision was bold, but it has produced
decoration which has an enthusiasm, a freshness of eye, that accord very
well with this tragedy of youthful passion performed by a youthful company.
Mr Andrews has inevitably had to accommodate the shape of his set to
existing choreographic outlines. His basic structure, of a curved and tiered
colonnade broken by a central stair, is handsome, and the stage space is
varied - for Juliet's bedroom; for the Capulet tomb - to provide a more
intimate, rectangular dance area. The decoration pays its historical dues to
quattrocento and cinquecento painting and architecture in shapes and colour.
It is an incidental pleasure that at moments one may recognise Mantegna or
Uccello, and Mr Andrews' own sense of delight in renaissance Italy is
communicated to performers and audience without undue fuss. Design is not
flawless - I find Escalus' glittering gold armour altogether too bright, and
the bushy page-boy wigs for Romeo and his chums help extinguish their
characters - but it is a brave and stimulating view of the drama, and it is
superlatively lit by Hans-Ake Sjoquist, who enhances every moment of the
action.
Monday night's premiere was intended to feature the Moscow guests Nina
Ananiashvili and Alexey Fadeyechev, both experienced MacMillan interpreters
after their success in Prince of the Pagodas. Unhappily, Fadeyechev has
sustained a knee injury, and Kevin O'Hare who replaced him, though
conscientious in everything, could not provide all the emotional and
physical rapport demanded by Ananiashvili's gifts. She is one of nature's
Juliets. The role is often played in terms of innocence awakening to a first
passion. With Ananiashvili there is the added fascination of seeing a
ballerina 'as' Juliet. The power and the savour of the interpretation lie in
the reconciliation of a child's grace with the authority of the superlative
classical artist. (Plisetskaya's ardent Juliet was just such a reading).
In the first act, Ananiashvili played sweetly to O'Hare's innocent Romeo,
the balcony scene exquisitely done. It was in the third act - which is
Juliet's alone - that she revealed her command of the role. As Romeo leaves
her bedroom, she stands as if stunned, lost in dreams; sitting for an
eternity on the bed, we see her draw courage from her feelings as her body
becomes erect; the run to Friar Laurence has an irresistible momentum (and
was superlatively lit by Mr Sjoquist); facing to her parents' anger, she
bows in acquiescence, then eddies away from them (and from her plight) in an
exquisite pas de bourree that speaks of her innermost feelings. It is
Ananiashvili's sensitivity to MacMillan's physical truths, and the refined
utterance she gives them, that make this so beautiful and honest a reading,
and one so grandly that of a ballerina.
Like O'Hare's Romeo, company performances are as yet mostly promising
sketches. Ensembles are full of vitality, albeit certain scenes seem
diffuse. The pacing and weighting of effects will come with experience, but
the production already represents a major achievement by the Birmingham
troupe. I salute Anita Landa's Nurse, a lovingly judged portrait, and the
clean dancing by the ensemble.
From Barry Wordsworth and the Royal Ballet Sinfonia, an account of
Prokofev's score that was vivid in colour, purposeful in drama.
Romeo and Juliet continues at the Hippodrome, Birmingham, until June 6;
thereafter it can be seen at the Apollo, Oxford, June 29, 30 and July 1; and
then in Southampton and Bristol.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Arts: No soap on 'The Bill' - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The question came in April at a party to celebrate the 80th birthday of BA
('Freddie') Young, former arts editor of this newspaper, former theatre
critic, and still our radio columnist: 'Why', asked this survivor of a
thousand first nights, expert on Ibsen and Moliere, lover of Shakespeare and
Chekhov, 'don't you ever write about The Bill?' The answer was that there
seemed no more reason why the FT's television critic should devote space to
a twice-weekly, half-hour, ratings-building ITV series than that our book
critics should write about Barbara Cartland or the art critic review
pictures of green-faced ladies from Boots. If The Bill why not EastEnders
and Home And Away? Because, said the doyen of drama critics, The Bill was
not a soap opera, it sustained a remarkably high standard of drama, and
would repay regular attention; don't just watch a couple of episodes, try it
for a month.
He was, of course, right. Six weeks of The Bill has proved that this is not
a soap opera: it is not concerned with family life nor even, to any great
extent, with the emotional turmoil of its characters. The fictional Sun Hill
police station, somewhere in central London, is at the centre of the series,
which is concerned solely with the work of the men and women stationed
there. Soap operas are particularly good at attracting female viewers,
whereas current affairs programmes tend to be watched by more men than
women. It would be no great surprise if The Bill attracted an audience
which, for half-hour serial drama, contained an unusually large proportion
of men. There is an authenticity about this programme which makes you more
inclined, sometimes, to compare it to World In Action or This Week than to
other drama series.
Of course previous police dramas have aimed for authenticity. Z Cars came to
the screen 30 years ago last January after writer Troy Kennedy Martin had
spent his time in bed with mumps eavesdropping on police radio messages and
been struck by the contrast between that reality and the cosiness of the
hugely popular Dixon Of Dock Green. But while Z Cars was concerned to
de-mythologise the police, and to bring to television a more honest picture
of the criminal world, there was a tendency for the stories to dwell upon
the social tensions in a policeman's life. Partly that is a sign of the
times, but the effect was a distinct soapiness around the edges - domestic
difficulties, or the effect of an illicit affair upon a policeman's conduct
 -which you rarely if ever find in The Bill.
That is not to imply, for anyone who has never seen it, that The Bill is
some dry-as-dust police procedure series which ignores the human element. On
the contrary, one of the chief interests is in seeing how characters that
you grow to know react to new situations. In one of last week's episodes
Detective Inspector Frank Burnside, Sun Hill's top plain-clothes man (I
think) had to arrest and interview a prostitute dealing in drugs. With all
the economy that the writers on this series always have to employ, since
each 25-minute episode contains a whole story, it was made clear that
Burnside had met Maria before. Asked by her to get out of the police car for
a private word, Burnside does so and the Woman Detective Constable Viv
Martella, left in the car, promptly assumes, with fury but also a lack of
surprise which speaks volumes, that a deal is being done.
That is precisely what is attempted by the attractive Maria who offers both
money and sex. Burnside hints that he may be open to negotiation, but
commits himself to nothing. In the interview room at Sun Hill there is a
frisson between them which Burnside makes no attempt to suppress. It is
clear that, even though he dislikes the way she has tempted girls into
carrying drugs back from Spain, he has a high regard for her intelligence
and may well be sexually attracted. They speak the same language, share much
expertise, and inhabit the same milieu. In the end Burnside does no deals
and Maria, presumably, has to face the music.
That one little constituent of just one episode vividly illustrates the
greatest strength and the greatest achievement of The Bill. This series does
not often have the exciting action sequences of programmes such as The
Sweeney, though when you do get a night time chase through wet city streets
it is well filmed. It does not go in for the same complex interleaving of
themes that we saw in Hill Street Blues, though there is always something
other than the main plot going on. What it understands and conveys more
clearly than any other police series is the fact that police and criminals
share a world upon which the rest of us only occasionally impinge.
Comprehensively and dramatically The Bill illustrates something that becomes
clear to anyone who ever does any crime reporting: that there is a peculiar
affinity between police and crooks. Willy nilly they inhabit the same
subculture, use the same slang, share certain assumptions, experience, and
expertise. Quite often police and criminals drink in the same pubs, eat in
the same cafes, and find themselves thrown together much of the time. This
is not to say that there is nothing to choose between them, nor that most
policemen are a bit bent. It is to say that, as with sheep and sheepdogs,
the two groups, however dramatic the differences between them, share the
most important parts of their lives with each other and not with the rest of
us.
It is not a solemn series. In the last few weeks life has been lightened by
boring Reg Hollis, Sun Hill's nerdish shop steward, or whatever they call it
in the Police Federation, who is beaten 58 to 2 when someone finally
challenges him for the post. One young officer goes on a course with the
Area Burglary Squad and then bores everyone to tears with his new expertise.
When a progressive boss tries to abolish us-and-them canteens not only does
his deputy complain 'But I like remote elitism, I don't want to share a
gunged-up sauce bowl with the likes of Laxton and Hollis', but the 'plods
and plonks' declare that they don't want to be spied on in their own
canteen, thank you very much.
What makes The Bill so strong is the feeling that it is very nearly a
documentary. To a lifetime resident of London the actors and actresses seem
remarkably like actual members of 'The Met': their London accents sound like
the real thing; they do not have that actorish - or actressy - glamour which
even a series as good as Hill Street Blues failed to avoid (though female
crooks in The Bill tend to be amazingly good looking and, as with Maria,
more spotlessly chic than their real counterparts in London's streets and
pubs). Above all, it is very rare in the plots of The Bill to find anything
in black and white: everything comes in shades of grey.
Remarkably, despite, or perhaps because of, all this grimy authenticity, it
is a heartening series. Showing the alcoholism and shoplifting, the
Fagin-like exploitation of the young, drug taking, racism, mugging,
prostitution, even two murders of young runaways in the past week (though
gratifyingly no shots of the corpses) you might think it must be depressing.
Not so. What it shows is that the people who work at Sun Hill, convincingly
lifelike precisely because they are so obviously imperfect, can deal with
all the horrors of life in a modern metropolis and still retain their
humanity. If they can do so that close to the coal face, surely the rest of
us can manage too.
Mr Young's eye for good drama is as accurate as ever.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Arts: Desdemona und ihre Schwestern - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLARK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With Henze's English Cat and Manfred Trojahn's Enrico among its recent
successes, the Schwetzingen Festival - based at the baroque court theatre a
few miles south of Mannheim - has proved fertile ground for operatic
premieres. This year brought a new chamber opera by Siegfried Matthus, east
Germany's leading composer, whose Judith and Cornet Rilke have already
reached other parts of Europe and America.
Despite a brilliantly executed performance, Desdemona und ihre Schwestern
(Desdemona and her sisters) was a disappointment. Matthus's dramatic
instincts, honed by a close association with the Komische Oper dating back
to the Felsenstein era, for once seem to have failed him. The opera, for
which Matthus as usual wrote his own libretto, is based on a novel by
Christine Bruckner, a cult figure of the women's movement in Germany. The
text of Desdemona reads like a tract of militant feminist ideology. Three
women - Megara from ancient Greece, Desdemona in her bridal chamber and
Judy, a convicted terrorist - step out of their historical surroundings to
reflect on and rant against a male-dominated society, which has made them
suffer by not allowing them to express themselves.
The work is a series of 'operatic monologues' (Matthus's description) for
soprano, mezzo and contralto, with the two 'spare' voices occasionally
expressing the innermost thoughts of the third. To provide some contrast,
Matthus introduces an unaccompanied quartet of male voices, who interrupt
the feminist diatribe with some distinctly unfeminist extracts from the Old
Testament, sung 'in the kind of place where men can talk about women
undisturbed'.
This high-brow role-playing lasts 90 minutes: it should have been cut by a
third. The work's main weakness is that it becomes excruciatingly
predictable. The text allows no room for dramatic development, and the
'sisters' are kept firmly in separate sound-worlds: much better to have one
singer adopting a number of different mantles, as in some stage adaptations
of the same novel. Nor does Matthus's brief finale ring true: the three
women suddenly conclude that nothing changes, and join the men in a few
juicy references to sexual interdependence from the Book of Solomon.
Some good music is wasted along the way. Matthus uses a 20-piece orchestra
sparingly, with eloquent scoring for electric bass guitar, bass flute and
bass clarinet. He never lapses into the affected modernisms of much
avant-garde music: instrumental effects invariably come off well - the vast
percussive crescendo before the finale was overwhelming - although the
outburst of taped rock music in one scene was uncharacteristically cheap.
The music for male quartet is a chromatic dirge and no match for the
fully-fledged choruses which are such a powerful feature of Matthus's other
operas. But the three women have plenty to get their teeth into - notably a
Kurt Weill-like mezzo ballad for Megara; a harp-accompanied soprano lament
for Desdemona, and spectacular contralto solos for Judy, full of tottering,
tension-filled rhythms.
These produced several stunning outbursts of contained fury from Yvonne
Wiedstruck, a singer-actress with great potential. As Megara (mystifyingly
confined to a wheelchair for half the performance), Karan Armstrong managed
to look both raunchy and motherly, relishing the attractive vocal
decorations in her part. Lucy Peacock's Desdemona was spunky and pretty.
Nothing but praise, too, for the predictably boorish male quartet (Clemens
Bieber, Uwe Peper, Peter Edelmann and Josef Becker). The opera deserved a
female production team - it might actually have profited from a Berghaus
point of view - but instead it was given a professional, post-modern staging
by Gotz Friedrich, with designs by Reinhart Zimmermann and Annette
Zepperitz. Rolf Reuter conducted with admirable clarity.
The production joins the repertory of the Komische Oper in Berlin on June
27.

FT  03 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Reinsurer can dispute claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RACHEL DAVIES, Barrister
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN RE A COMPANY NO 0013734 OF 1991 Chancery Division: Mr Roger Kaye QC
sitting as a deputy High Court judge: April 30 1992
A WINDING-up petition brought against reinsurers by an insolvent reinsured
for non-payment under reinsurance contracts in respect of settled or
actuarially valued but as yet unpaid insurance claims, will be struck out
despite contractual wording which in a simple case would impose an
obligation on the reinsurers to indemnify for unpaid claims, if they dispute
liability in good faith and on substantial grounds raising issues
inappropriate for resolution on the petition.
Mr Roger Kaye QC sitting as a deputy Chancery judge, so held when granting
an application by the reinsurer company to strike out a winding-up petition
presented by the reinsured.
HIS LORDSHIP said that the reinsured was in liquidation, having been ordered
to be wound up by the Supreme Court of Bermuda on May 17 1985.
It claimed Dollars 122,244 against the company under two reinsurance
contracts. The sum represented Dollars 43,119 settled claims, and Dollars
87,498 claims which had not been settled but were calculated following an
actuarial valuation of the underlying contingent claims against the
reinsured. The valuation was carried out in a manner approved by order of
the Bermuda court.
The company argued that no liability to pay had arisen. It said the petition
should be struck out because the debt on which it was based was disputed in
good faith and on substantial grounds.
The reinsured contended that there was no bona fide or substantial dispute.
Under the two contracts, the company's liability was to 'pay the excess of
an ultimate net loss' over specified limits.
By article 6 'ultimate net loss' meant 'the sum actually paid by the
reinsured in settlement of losses or liability'.
The article must be read in conjunction with articles 15 and 16.
Article 15 provided that 'all loss settlements made by the reinsured
including compromise settlements' were binding on the company 'upon
reasonable evidence of the amount paid being given by the reinsured'.
Article 16 provided that the reinsurance was subject to the same terms as
the original policies 'and shall pay as may be paid thereon'.
To avoid a protracted liquidation the liquidators arranged actuarial
valuation of the contingent claims, approved by the Bermuda court.
Mr Chivers for the company submitted that the reinsured was not entitled to
call for payment unless and until the original claim was actually settled
and paid. He said there was no evidence that the settled or the actuarial
claims had been actually paid.
Mr Millett for the reinsured argued that the combined effect of articles 6,
15 and 16 was that all that was necessary was to show the amount of the
company's liability, which was established in the form of settled claims or,
in the case of the actuarial claims, by the Bermuda order.
The latter, he said, amounted to a 'loss settlement' or 'compromise
settlement' binding the company under article 15.
The first issue was whether it was a precondition of the company's liability
that the reinsured should actually have paid the assureds. The issue related
to both settled and actuarial claims.
Article 6 referred to sums 'actually paid'. Article 15 referred to
'reasonable evidence of the amount paid', and to 'loss settlements'. Article
16 referred to the requirement to pay as might be 'paid'.
The material word used was 'paid'. At first blush therefore, on the language
of the reinsurance contracts, the court would have been inclined to favour
Mr Chiver's interpretation.
Nevertheless, the authorities cast considerable doubt as to whether, at
least in the case of an insolvent reinsured, that approach was correct.
In Re Eddystone Marine Insurance (1892) 2 Ch 423, Mr Justice Stirling upheld
a contention by liquidators that, notwithstanding that the reinsured had not
actually paid the assureds, the reinsurer was liable to indemnify it.
The case concerned a 'pay as may be paid clause', but did not deal with an
'ultimate net loss' clause of the type reflected in article 6.
That type of clause came under consideration in Home v Overseas Insurance v
Mentor Insurance (1989) 1 Lloyd's Rep 473,480.
There, plaintiff reinsurers argued that the loss clause was so clear that
they could only be liable after the reinsured had actually paid the
assureds. Mr Justice Hirst rejected the submission. He said it was 'unjust
and discordant with commercial good sense that, by reason of the accident of
a reinsured becoming insolvent, the reinsurer (who had accepted premiums)
should go scot-free'.
Were it a simple matter of construction and the only issue was whether
settled (albeit not actually paid) claims fell within the terms of the
reinsurance contracts, the present court would have refused to strike out
the petition.
There was considerable force in the reasoning of Mr Justice Stirling and Mr
Justice Hirst. It did seem a matter of plain common sense that in the
context of a winding-up 'paid' must mean 'liable to pay'.
However, it would not be right to allow the present petition to go forward
on the first issue.
The factors leading to that conclusion included the following:
It was not the only issue in the case. Other issues might have a significant
bearing on the construction of the reinsurance contracts. The reinsured was
being wound up in Bermuda. It was not clear which law governed the
contracts. That might have a bearing. It was clear from the number of
authorities considered in Mentor that the matter was by no means simple and
straightforward, particularly where the reinsured had become insolvent.
Also, there was the additional complication of the actuarial claims. It
might be that the company (which contended it had no notice of the claims
calculations) could intervene in the Bermudan proceedings to challenge the
methodology leading to calculation.
Those factors raised serious and complex issues which were not appropriate
to resolve on an interlocutory motion or on the hearing of a winding-up
petition.
The court could not say that the company's argument had no rational prospect
of success, or that the reinsured's argument could not be seriously
questioned.
On that basis alone therefore, the company showed that the reinsured's
claims were bona fide disputed on substantial grounds.
The second issue was whether valuation of contingent liabilities in
accordance with the Bermuda order was a 'loss settlement' or 'compromise
settlement' for the purposes of article 15.
Mr Chivers said it was not, because inter alia the company was not a party
to it and the Bermuda court did not purport to settle claims by the
reinsured against the company. Mr Millett submitted that it was, because
inter alia the company had every opportunity to be aware of it and did not
challenge the method of valuation. He said it did not matter that the
company was not a direct party to the order.
Again, the court was satisfied that the company showed that that part of the
petition debt which was dependent on actuarial valuation was bona fide
disputed on substantial grounds. There was a serious issue to be tried as to
whether the Bermuda order was indeed a 'loss settlement' for the purposes of
article 15.
The third issue was whether the reinsured had provided 'reasonable evidence'
of the claims for the purposes of article 15.
Its figures had already been challenged and corrected, and it was impossible
to say that they could not be seriously questioned when examined in the full
light of discovery and forensic examination.
The petition should not be allowed to go forward in the present state of the
evidence. It did not make it clear beyond peradventure and without more,
that the company was indebted in the sum claimed.
For the reinsured: Richard Millett (DJ Freeman).
For the company: David Chivers (Paisner &amp; Co).

FT  03 JUN 92 / Docklands revisited
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Michael Boyce, who has been appointed chief executive of Cardiff Bay
Development Corporation , could be described as the father of the whole
project to redevelop the Welsh capital's decaying docklands.
His paper to the Welsh Office in 1986, written when he was deputy chief
executive of South Glamorgan County Council, was the basis on which the
government set up a quango to oversee the scheme - at 2,700 acres the
largest redevelopment project in Britain after London's docklands.
Now, aged 54, he has just enough time to complete the job before retirement;
the project, begun in 1987, was always seen as a 15-20 year scheme.
His faith in Cardiff Bay has been undiminished despite the scheme coming off
the boil as the property world went into deep recession. Promoted council
chief executive five years ago, he was instrumental in siting the rebuilt
County Hall in the Bay, the only significant investment in the area to have
reached completion.
A solicitor by training, Boyce began his local government career in Exeter,
but came to South Wales 21 years ago.
Boyce, who takes up his new position at the beginning of July, refuses to
acknowledge being daunted by the fate of Canary Wharf. Cardiff has
'consistently had the opportunity to learn from London's mistakes' he
asserts, adding that observation of other docklands regeneration schemes -
such as Baltimore in Maryland - has convinced him of the 'absolute need to
get the infrastructure right, with public sector involvement ahead of
private sector investment.'

Paul Selway-Swift, 48, is the obvious beneficiary of last week's boardroom
reshuffle at the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (the
HongkongBank). Selway-Swift, who is responsible for the group's operations
in Hong Kong and China, is far and away the youngest of the three new
executive directors promoted to the board of HongkongBank, the main
operating subsidiary of the HSBC Holdings parent.
In addition to Selway-Swift, Tony Townsend, 57, and Richard Hale, 55, have
been appointed to the board of HongkongBank. Along with Willie Purves and
John Gray, chairman and deputy chairman of HSBC Holdings, the three new
executive directors make up the top management team of the group's
traditional business in the Asia-Pacific region.
Following last year's reorganisation, the boards of the HongkongBank and its
parent HSBC Holdings, which also controls group companies outside the
region, are being separated. Although they will continue to share some
common directors, the intention is that the HSBC Holdings board will have a
more international flavour. At present the board is dominated by local Hong
Kong businessmen.
If the group succeeds in taking over Midland Bank it has promised to put Sir
Peter Walters and Brian Pearse, chairman and chief executive of Midland
Bank, on the HSBC board along with Richard Delbridge, Midland's finance
director. Two of Midland's eight independent non-executive directors, Sir
Patrick Meaney and Geoffrey Maitland Smith, have also been promised seats.
If the takeover is consummated, Midland directors would have six of the 22
seats on the board, assuming no other changes.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Hotels check out green
credentials
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Hotel groups around the world are getting together to promote good
environmental practice by committing more than 1m rooms to an environmental
campaign. The scheme will be launched this summer by the Prince of Wales
Business Leaders' Forum, a network of international company chairmen and
chief executives supporting the concepts of good corporate citizenship and
sustainable development.
Hilton International, Inter-Continental Hotels, Marriott, Meridien, Ramada
and Sheraton are among the groups due to sign an environmental charter for
the industry, covering areas such as waste management, product purchasing,
air quality, energy conservation and noise pollution.
The initiative stems from the work of the Inter-Continental Hotels group,
which last year developed a comprehensive reference manual incorporating the
environmental practices implemented by its 101 hotels. The manual was made
available to the group's main competitors and relevant industry
organisations, and now, through a link with the Business Leaders Forum, is
being promoted as an international industry-wide handbook. John van Praag,
chief executive of Inter-Continental, said implementing environmental
measures did involve a financial commitment up front, but this would be
recouped longer-term through reduced operating costs.
However, environmental responsibility was not being pursued for economic
reasons, he said. 'The only business reason that could motivate change is if
hotels feel their clientele will stay with them because they are visibly
conscious of their effect on the environment.' Shareholders were also
increasingly demanding environmentally-responsible practices.
Inter-Continental's environmental policy is that the group 'recognises its
moral and ethical responsibilities as a global citizen in protecting the
environment for this and future generations'.
Inter-Continental devotes one half-page of its hotel room brochure to tell
clients of its environmental measures. They include re-using and saving
water in the hotel laundries (a laundry at a 500-room hotel at 80 per cent
occupancy uses about 20m litres of water a year); energy conservation
through insulation, improved design and appliance efficiency; auditing
products and services purchased for their environmental impact; re-using and
recycling products to reduce waste, for example tearing up worn linen for
cleaning cloths and dusters.
Employee training and commitment is seen as crucial - as is keeping staff
informed of environmental achievements. The Inter-Continental group operates
a bonus system for employees based on a hotel's environmental rating. Its
hotels are subjected to quarterly appraisals and each receives a grade -
taking into account such things as the availability of recycling outlets in
developing countries.
The hotel's environmental reference manual explains in detail such subjects
as air emissions, asbestos, CFCs and global warming, and describes how
hotels can exercise their environmental responsibility. Practical advice is
accompanied by sample checklists, diagrams for energy and waste management
systems and even equations to help a hotel calculate how much of its waste
paper could be recycled.
The Business Leaders' Forum hopes the co-operative venture will become a
model for other global industrial sectors. 'The hotel industry is very
decentralised with highly centralised controls. It's the best industry in
the world for implementing this,' said Robert Davies, the forum's chief
executive.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Business and the Environment: Beautiful face, polluted soul
 -Rio de Janeiro's once-sparkling bay is turning into a cesspool. Christina
Lamb examines a plan to restore its natural splendour
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Entering the bay of Rio de Janeiro with its long sweeps of golden sand
backed by strangely shaped granite peaks must feature among the most
spectacular sights in the world.
Visitors arriving for the Earth Summit will no doubt be as impressed as the
bay's first tourist, Amerigo Vespucci, the Italian navigator, back in 1502.
But while Vespucci found a sparkling island-strewn bay surrounded by a
rainforest inhabited by a few thousand Indians, today's visitors may notice
a slightly rank smell and find the beaches less than appealing for swimming.
The 380 sq km bay, known as Guanabara, or 'arm of the sea', is dying as a
result of large quantities of litter and untreated sewage thrown into it
each day by an ever-swelling population.
In the last 20 years the number of fish has been reduced by 90 per cent and
its heavily polluted waters provide a striking symbol of the effect of
poverty and development on the environment - the heart of the Earth Summit
debate.
The Guanabara Bay is today a huge rubbish dump into which 9m people throw
470 tonnes of untreated sewage and 5,500 tonnes of litter each day. This is
joined by 70 tonnes of effluent from 6,000 industries and nine tonnes of oil
from two refineries. Landfills to construct roads to cope with the influx of
migrants from Brazil's drought-stricken northeast has reduced the number of
islands from 43 to four.
So serious is the situation that the financially pressed Rio authorities
have decided that the problem can no longer be ignored. This week a loan
will be signed with the Japanese Overseas Export Credit Fund (OECF) and a
pledge given from the Inter-American Development Bank (IBD) for a Dollars
777m (Pounds 430m) project aimed at halting the pollution and reducing by 30
per cent the quantity of untreated sewage in the bay. This will form the
initial part of a Dollars 4bn programme to restore the bay which it is hoped
will then serve as a model for other Latin American cities located on
estuaries.
Some 12 technicians from the Japanese International Co-operation Agency
(Jica) are already in Rio analysing the water. From their studies they will
create mathematical simulations of its hydrodynamic qualities such as the
currents and how long water is retained. This will then be developed into a
masterplan for the next 10 years.
Japanese assistance will be based on experience of cleaning the Bay of Tokyo
 -which is four times larger and took 30 years to restore. 'When we started
depolluting Tokyo's bay conditions were similar. The number of fish had been
greatly reduced and no one could enter the water,' says Senro Imai from
Jica.
Rio, he says, will be easier in that the number of inhabitants and
industries are fewer but the water is shallower. Moreover, Imai points out:
'We did not throw untreated sewage in our bay. Our problem was more with
industrial effluent which is easier to control.'
The combination of organic material such as sewage and litter collected in
the Rio bay has led to an excess of nutrients which accelerates the growth
of algae and leads to an overconsumption of oxygen, killing off higher
organisms.
'The situation is really worrying. You can sense the bad smell as you go
past. Recuperation will bring immense benefits as it did to Tokyo such as
recovery of fishes and leisure activities boosting the economy,' says Imai.
The clean-up of Guanabara Bay is the biggest environmental project ever
undertaken in Rio. The first stage will comprise Dollars 350m from the IBD,
Dollars 248m from the OECF and Dollars 179m from the state authorities.
Contracts for the large number of works involved will be open to
international bidding and the Rio authorities hope to benefit from some
transfer of technology.
The project has five main components:
A series of sanitation works to improve sewage collection and treatment as
well as water distribution. Currently, around half the people living in the
bay area do not have sewage facilities while around half of what is
collected is not treated.
These services will be extended while water distribution will be improved.
'Even though we have plenty of potable water, currently we suffer losses of
50 per cent of the water in distribution because of the age of the system
and the various leaks and holes that have developed,' explains Manoel
Sanches, head of the Guanabara Bay project.
Drainage. The 35 rivers flowing into the bay start from sharp inclines. This
means that as they near the plains around the bay they spread easily. When
it rains heavily this provokes violent floods in the city of Rio and
landslides in the slums or favelas in which hundreds of people have died in
recent years.
Solid waste or litter. The litter thrown into rivers by favela populations
worsens the drainage and flooding problem. This project plans to collect
litter to prevent it going into rivers.
A complementary environment programme of monitoring and environmental
education.
Digital mapping to chart the bay through aerial and satellite photos. The
information will be stored on computer in order to study urban occupation
and the use of public services, and to plan the use of land for agriculture,
urban population or forest regeneration.
Sanches says this has a twofold value: 'It will enable us to prepare plans
for providing drainage, transport and housing but will also be of immense
benefit in terms of tax collection because we can detect where people are
using services and not paying.'
This project began one year ago and Sanches says it has already resulted in
a 25 per cent - or Dollars 150m - increase in revenue collection. 'This will
give financial viability to the project. The aim is for the programme to be
self-financing,' he stresses.
In planning the depollution programme the populist state government has come
across a problem which Sanches describes as a 'symbolic paradox between
development and environment' and which is at the crux of current debate
between north and south.
'If you extend urban services such as sewage collection you improve the
quality of life for people who currently throw their sewage into the ditches
in front of their houses.
'But at the same time you increase the amount of organic material thrown
into the bay, and thus pollution, because we cannot afford to treat it. The
alternative is to increase treatment of that already collected and not
extend collection services,' he explains.
'The problem is that resources are always scarce and environmental demands
are always limitless. For the time being we have to make a choice between
increasing the network which is politically more acceptable or increasing
the treatment of what we already collect, which is better from the
environmental standpoint. The challenge is to find an equilibrium.'
Within this Dollars 4bn programme the aim is to increase both sewage
collection and treatment to avoid further pollution and to reduce the amount
of untreated material entering by almost a third. But to completely
recuperate the bay would, says Sanches, take far more.
'Realistically we are probably never again going to have dolphins playing,'
says Roberto D'Avila, the state environment secretary.
The project is particularly important in Brazil because 70 per cent of the
country's population is concentrated in coastal areas and only two of its 10
big metropolitan regions are inland.
D'Avila is confident that it can result in social and environmental benefit
for the area and political benefit for the state government: 'I see this as
a very symbolic project which reunites urban development and social service,
environmental protection and transfer of technology. It is the perfect
example of the Earth Summit.'

FT  03 JUN 92 / Jobs: How to get round the secretary barrier - With ever
more managers chasing ever fewer openings, success may depend on guerrilla
tactics
</HEADLINE>

'HOW do you speak to an angel?' That song-title will mean nothing to any but
a few fellow-wrinklies among the readership. It was high on the hit-parade
(then called the Top Twenty) four decades ago, and the stripling Jobs column
used to hum it wistfully while pining for the icy Joyce Miller.
Alas for romance] Time soon showed that, where real life is concerned, the
question asked by the song is less important than another - to wit: How do
you get past a top executive's secretary?
It can still be a conundrum even now, when my request to speak to the chief
is backed by the FT's title. In smaller outfits particularly, the
secretarial keepers of managerial gates seem programmed to react to the name
of any publication with: 'We're not interested in advertising'.
The more sophisticated, while less direct, are rarely much warmer. They
typically respond by professing scarcely credible ignorance as to whether
their bosses are in, before adding: 'What's it about, please?' And that
applies not only to supreme chieftains, but if anything the more so to heads
of subsidiary departments such as personnel.
If secretarial gatekeepers are a knotty problem to the likes of me, they
must seem an insuperable one to a sadly still growing number of other
people. They are executives who've lost their jobs, often through no fault
of their own, in a day when many if not most organisations are whittling
down their numbers of managers.
At the best of times, official recruiting processes are apt to be more
defensive than welcoming. For instance, research by Britain's Institute of
Manpower Studies in the buoyant late-1980s showed that the prime concern of
most recruiters is not to seek out the right person for a job, but to avoid
hiring the wrong one. Now, with more and more managers pursuing a dwindling
demand for same, the official defences must be harder to penetrate than
ever.
So however much job-seekers may have to offer a company, their only decent
chance of being seriously considered is to bend the ear of someone with
personal power to make a hiring decision. Which gives unprecedented force to
the question of how to get past top managers' secretaries and, in
particular, how to circumvent the road-blocking 'What's it about?'
An appealing dodge that I've heard recommended, and by an ex-gatekeeper at
that, is to reply: 'If he wants you to know, I'm sure he'll tell you.'
But whatever relief such a put-down may give to the caller's bruised ego,
there is at least one authority who thinks the tactic will usually have the
opposite of the desired effect. He is David Werner, a marketing consultant,
working from New York. As head of David Werner International he advises
executives not only how to package ideas and products on behalf of their
companies, but also on how to present themselves to prospective employers.
In his view, the recommended tactic is based on a common misconception about
top-level secretaries. Their bosses may speak of them as guardian angels.
But the fact is that they have typically been hardened in the fire. They
wouldn't be where they are if they hadn't become used to such attempted
put-downs, and learned to counter them with stinging efficiency.
Hence the best strategy, he says, is not confrontation but the devious type.
Even so, it is of course imperative to have done your homework on the target
company and executive, and the idea you're proposing, as well as ensuring
that every checkable fact you voice is true.
As a case study, let's suppose that you have lost your job after a period in
Germany and your idea is to extend the company's representation there. When
the secretary asks: 'What's it about?', a useful beginning is to signal
there's a risk of confusion by saying something like: 'It's a touch
complicated, I'm afraid.'
Then, even though the target executive is a complete stranger, continue:
'We've met before, but not for some time. I've been working in Germany, and
I want to touch base with him because there's a business opportunity I know
he'd be interested in.'
According to David Werner, the chances are that once the message has been
relayed, you'll be put through. Naturally, the executive will ask how he
knows you. But when he does, your reply is: 'I'm sorry? I didn't say we knew
each other. What I said was we've not met before, but for some time I've
been working in Germany, and there's a business opportunity there. You see .
. . .'
Although whether the idea bears fruit must remain to be seen, you have
secured your first objective of getting the decision-maker's ear. True, the
price of it has been falsely suggesting that the secretary wrongly reported
what you said, but only by misplacing the single word 'not' which is surely
something any busy person, however efficient, can be forgiven for. Besides,
the New York consultant says, 'at times like these for executives, getting
re-employed calls for guerrilla warfare.'
Nevertheless he adds that the canniest guerrillas do not start their
secretary-circumventing with a telephone call. They first prepare the ground
by sending the target chief a letter of at most 20 lines in length, and
nothing more. (One of David Werner's rules for writing speculatively to
employers, as distinct from recruitment consultants, is never send a
curriculum vitae at first. That's best left until a chat with the
appropriate boss has given more idea of what's wanted.) His pattern for the
letter reads:
Working in Germany recently, I discovered a niche market for a product like
yours - one where only three suppliers are active, all importers. The market
opportunity, as I see it, would require a modest investment to set up a
small assembly plant. Is it your intention to expand in Europe?
If it is, and you think a dis-cussion might be useful, please call me. My
number is . . . .
While it's helpful to add any career details that support your candidature,
he says, they should be put in a postscript beginning: 'In case you wonder
who I am . . . . The PS itself is a valuable aid because experience shows it
makes the letter stand out.
What you've written serves as a spearhead for the telephone call a bit
later. 'The bona fide new venture,' smiles David Werner, 'the best by-pass
weapon of all.' When the secretary asks what your business is, you reply:
'The German market proposal I've been in touch with him about.'
THEN again, for discarded executives who'd rather change their career than
descend to such tactics, there may be help in a new charitable trust. It has
been set up in memory of Lord Seebohm, the former Barclays Bank director
killed in a road accident in 1990, by his children Richard and Caroline
Seebohm, and Victoria Glendinning.
They have so far raised just over Pounds 100,000 to provide grants of up to
Pounds 5,000 for people wanting to change career. The Frederic Seebohm
Fellowships will go to applicants who can show a sense of mission or
public-service commitment, a fully worked-out career plan, and financial
circumstances that either rule out the desired move or put their family unit
at risk in making it. Application forms from Judi Barwick, Frederic Seebohm
Charitable Trust, 5 Tavistock Place, London WC1 9SS; tel 071-383 2124.
