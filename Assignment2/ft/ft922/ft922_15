FT  03 JUN 92 / Management: The road to recovery - Peugeot and Renault have
made big strides to put their chequered pasts behind them. William Dawkins
says they now plan to take on the Japanese carmakers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS

<TEXT>
It used to be said that French carmakers would be knocked spinning by
Japanese competition once Europe lifted its curbs on car imports at the end
of the decade.
Now is the time to send that view to the crusher. Over the past decade,
Peugeot and Renault, the country's two main car groups, have retreated from
the brink of bankruptcy and top executives at both believe they can catch up
and fight on equal terms with Japan.
Last year, the Peugeot group, which also includes Citroen, was the world's
most profitable carmaker in terms of net sales margins. Renault staged a
startling recovery, with more than doubled net profits, and outsold all
foreign competition in the fast growing German market.
Can these be the same companies that were one of Europe's biggest industrial
headaches 10 years ago? Not quite. Since then, they have made big increases
in quality, productivity and efficiency.
European volume producers took more than twice as long per man as their
Japanese counterparts to make a car in 1989, according to a seminal study by
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT)*. Today, French carmakers'
productivity is a mere 10 per cent behind that of Japanese car producers in
Britain, itself 10 per cent behind the Japanese in Japan, says another study
by consultants McKinsey.
Just how Peugeot and Renault came so far is instructive to other European
manufacturing industries aiming to match Japanese productivity standards.
Like carmakers across the world, the French have made deep cuts in their
workforces, down by 25 per cent over the past five years at Renault and 5
per cent at the leaner Peugeot. They still have a long way to go, according
to a recent study by the French planning commission, which estimates that
the French car industry must trim its labour force by another 2.5 per cent a
year for the rest of the decade to be competitive.
Job cuts are only part of the story. Peugeot and Renault have have also made
profound changes in the way people and stocks are organised, overturning old
hierarchies and introducing Japanese-style project and production management
teams.
Peugeot reckons to have improved the number of cars made per man by 50 per
cent in five years, while Renault says it has improved its productivity by 6
per cent per year over the same period. Both aim to repeat that improvement
by the end of the decade.
This is partly the result of heavy investment in automated production lines
in the mid-1980s. The investment has not been an unqualified success,
however. Recently, they have re-introduced more labour and simpler machines
to the shopfloor, because the new robots broke down too often.
This is revealing, for as the MIT study pointed out, organisation is more
important than automation in even the most modern Japanese plants. Again,
Renault and Peugeot applied a lesson from Japan by breaking down the old
production line into small, autonomous units, each responsible for product
quality and machine maintenance.
This has already enabled Peugeot to close the refinishing departments which
used to occupy 10 to 20 per cent of total production time. 'Now each team
does its own refinishing on the production line and is taught to treat the
next team down the line as a customer,' says Jean-Yves Helmer, director of
the Peugeot group's car division.
French carmakers see themselves today, like their Japanese competitors, as
primarily designers and assemblers. They have mostly stopped being highly
integrated, although they still make what they consider to be strategic
components like automatic gearboxes, where Peugeot and Renault are
considering collaborating. Bought-in components have risen to just over 60
per cent of costs at Peugeot and 67 per cent at Renault, a steep rise over
recent years.
Renault has set up a 'make or buy committee', which treats in-house
suppliers on the same footing as external components makers, says Philippe
Gras, deputy chief executive. Like the Japanese, the French have started to
work more closely with component suppliers, to the extent of consulting on
new designs.
Peugeot and Renault have for the past five years been running joint audits
to keep component suppliers' quality up to the mark, grading them - Japanese
style again - according to their ability to do their own quality control.
They are thinking of extending this system to cover suppliers' productivity
too.
Suppliers are also expected to deliver more frequently to match the
just-in-time stock control which is now commonplace in both groups'
factories. Peugeot, for example, has reduced its stocks of unfinished goods
from 12 days' supply in 1984 to four days last year. But this technique is
also a risk for French carmakers, because they cannot guarantee
Japanese-style labour stability. Renault discovered this to its cost last
year when a strike at its engine and gearbox plant took 10 days to bring its
entire French and Belgian car production to a halt.
Design management is another important element in productivity where the
French are quickly applying lessons from the Far East. Japan still designs
and launches new cars much faster and more cheaply than France, for around
FFr3-4bn (Pounds 300m-Pounds 400m) in three years, as against the French
average of FFr6-8bn in four to five years.
Renault and Peugeot have taken similar approaches to the problem. Formerly,
new cars were designed in a cumbersome way, with the blueprint passing from
the design department through engineering and production management. Both
companies have in the past three years started setting up project teams,
which bring together all departments involved in a new car launch to work
simultaneously.
design teams of its two sister companies under a single management to help
them work faster and expects to produce the first concrete results for new
models from 1994.
Both agree that despite the progress, one big problem remains. French
carworkers are older and less educated than their Japanese counterparts.
'Gigantic efforts,' are needed to correct this handicap, says the planning
commission report, which calls for heavy public spending on retraining.
'We have from now until the year 2000 to get up to the right level. All of
us in the company know we can do it,' says Gras.

FT  03 JUN 92 / MPs set to challenge Maastricht bill agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOME MPs are set to challenge the amendments chosen for discussion at the
start of today's debate on the legislation to enact the Maastricht treaty.
They have complained that proper consideration of the terms of the
Maastricht agreement has been made harder because the bill - only four
clauses long - has been very difficult to amend.
Though more than 100 amendments have been tabled, not all are even eligible
for selection for debate by the Chair because they are beyond the scope of
the bill.
'When the 1972 act taking the UK into the Community started its committee
stage, points of order began at 3.30 in the afternoon and continued until
7.00 the following morning,' one Euro-sceptic recalled yesterday.
As a procedural device to allow debate on aspects of the treaty, the Labour
frontbench has put down a series of amendments to omit various sections of
the agreement. Though some of these are almost exactly the same as
amendments put forward by Euro-sceptics, the opposition business managers do
not plan to vote on most of them.
Labour does, however, intend to press for a vote on its amendments on
economic and monetary union and on the social chapter, but it would not
receive the support of Tory rebels.
Both the Labour Euro-sceptics and the Tory rebels have put down amendments
that would enable a referendum to take place. Other amendments would require
consent of the Commons before ratification or implementation of the treaty.
The decisions about which amendments will be allowed is critically important
to the rebels' chances of exerting any pressure on the government.
If progress is slow, not just today and tomorrow but on future days for the
committee stage, ministers may be forced to consider guillotining debate.
The danger is, however, that the opposition parties could combine with the
rebels to vote down a timetable.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Witness agrees he spoke of 'rumours'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FORMER head of UK equity trading at Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank,
agreed yesterday that he had described as 'rumours' and 'stories'
information he had been given by a stockbroker now accused of attempted
market rigging.
Mr Timothy Medland, now a stocktrader with Swiss Bank Corporation, was a
prosecution witness at the trial at Knightsbridge Crown Court of Mr Peter
Marks, a director of Branston and Gothard.
Mr Marks has pleaded not guilty to a charge under section 47 of the
Financial Services Act of making a misleading, false or deceptive statement
to induce share dealing.
The prosecution alleges that, as part of an attempted 'bear raid', Mr Marks
told Mr Medland on October 12, 1990, that Maxwell Communications Corporation
would be filing for bankruptcy that day - knowing it to be untrue.
The conversation took place between two others in which Mr Marks agreed to
sell two blocks of 100,000 MCC shares to Goldman Sachs.
Cross-examined by Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, for Mr Marks, Mr Medland said the
information had been presented to him by Mr Marks as 'a statement of fact'.
He agreed that Mr Marks had ended by asking him if he had any comment and
had appeared to be looking for information.
Mr Medland also agreed that when giving evidence in the case at magistrates
court he had called what Mr Marks had told him 'rumours'.
He also accepted that when he had reported the matter to Mr Eric Sheinberg,
Goldman Sachs managing director in New York, he had spoken of 'stories . . .
circulating . . . that (MCC) have gone under'.
Mr Richard Lines, an investigator with the Stock Exchange insider dealing
group, said that when interviewed Mr Marks had said he had merely been
passing on to Goldman Sachs a story he had heard was 'going the rounds'.
Mr Lines said that Mr Marks had said that he had not known if it was true,
but had telephoned Goldman Sachs, with which his firm had dealt before,
because it was known to be a big buyer of Maxwell shares.
The trial continues today.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Ombudsman attacks methods of investment sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INVESTMENT ombudsman yesterday strongly criticised selling methods in
the industry, saying that most disputes arose out of misunderstandings of
what clients had requested.
The ombudsman, Mr Richard Youard, said cases referred to him had decreased
slightly in the year to the end of March to 67, from 89 in the previous
year. The number of cases resolved rose slightly from 98 to 100. But there
had been a big increase in the amount paid out in compensation which rose
from Pounds 22,655 to Pounds 114,272. The largest amount paid in a
settlement was Pounds 25,031, up from Pounds 8,715 last year. About half the
cases were resolved in favour of the complainant.
Mr Youard said the fall in complaints - which contrasts with a marked
increase in criticism of banks, building societies and insurance companies -
was probably caused by the recession, which discouraged stock market
in-vestment while increasing reliance on banks and building societies.
In his criticism of selling methods, he referred to the lack of notes taken
at interviews by salesmen. 'It's quite possible for a salesman to be a
salesman and an adviser at the same time but it's difficult, and because a
salesman instinctively sells, things can go wrong.'
Mr Youard also criticised cost disclosure for unit-trust products. These
comments may have an impact on the Securities and Investments Board's review
of retail investment regulation, which has settled on disclosure rules for
life assurance, but has yet to make firm proposals on unit-trust disclosure.
The ombudsman claimed the 'health warning' on unit-trust marketing material,
which says that the price of units can go down as well as up, was
misunderstood, and should have greater prominence. He said: 'What in my
view, is required as a matter of urgency is the abandonment of the present
warning and its substitution in a prominent form by such words as 'you may
get back less than you invested'.'
He also found that the 'bid/offer' price-spread for unit trusts was
misunderstood. He said he would be delighted if the expression were
abandoned for ever 'since I have seen far too many cases where it has been
wholly misunderstood by the investor'. It should be substituted, he said,
with a simple statement that the cost of the manager's services, expressed
either as an amount of money or as a percentage, would be deducted from the
investment on the first day.
Mr Philip Warland, director general of the Unit Trust Association, said the
ombudsman was 'pushing against an open door'. He added: 'The UTA believes
that further simplification of pricing is desirable and we are at the moment
consulting our members.'
The investment ombudsman deals with disputes between customers and members
of Imro, the Investment Managers' Regulatory Office. The costs of running
the operation, which last year decreased slightly to Pounds 205,000, are
covered by Imro members.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Company failures at lowest for 18 months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE NUMBER of companies passing into administration and receivership in May
fell to the lowest level for 18 months.
Figures compiled from the official London and Edinburgh gazettes by Touche
Ross, the accountancy firm, show that banks made 358 insolvency appointments
last month, compared with 389 in March and 527 in February. The previous low
was 325 in December 1990.
Mr Christopher Morris, head of corporate special services at Touche Ross,
said the lower numbers probably reflected the bottoming out of the
recession. There were grounds for 'cautious optimism' on the number of
future corporate failures.
In the first five months of this year there were 2,306 appointments of
receivers or administrators, compared with 2,432 for the same period last
year. Coopers &amp; Lybrand received 345 appointments, Peat Marwick 271 and
Ernst &amp; Young 195.
The bank appointing most insolvency practitioners was National Westminster
with 482.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Nuclear survey of Kara Sea proposed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN is to approach the Commonwealth of Independent States for permission
to send a research vessel to the Kara Sea, south of the Arctic Ocean, where
radioactive waste was dumped by the former Soviet Union.
An initial request, in 1989, to monitor radioactivity in the nearby Barents
Sea was turned down by the Soviet authorities.
Officials at the Ministry of Agriculture responsible for radiation
monitoring around the UK coastline are drawing up details of the approach to
the CIS.
British officials want to study the movement of radioactivity from the dump
area. Scientists believe contamination may be spreading.
Radioactivity has been detected in the sea around Greenland and the
Sellafield nuclear reprocessing works of British Nuclear Fuels has come
under suspicion. British scientists believe Sellafield is unlikely to be the
source.
Regular monitoring of an area of the Atlantic Ocean formerly used by Britain
to dump radioactive waste has failed to detect any leakage.
Dumping in the area, 400 miles from the coast, was suspended in 1982, after
a campaign by environmentalists. The ocean there is more than half a mile
deep.

FT  03 JUN 92 / BAe cuts satellite capacity and jobs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH AEROSPACE is to halve its satellite manufacturing capacity with the
loss of up to 640 jobs. The cuts will be at the BAe Space Systems plant in
Stevenage, Hertfordshire, the only builder of commercial satellites in the
UK.
BAe blamed the job cuts on the loss of an order last week for a Japanese
satellite. That went to Hughes Aircraft of Los Angeles, the world's most
successful maker of communications satellites.
Mr David McLaurin, managing director of BAe's communications satellite
division, said: 'We regret having to make this announcement. However, it is
necessary to protect the business for the future and allow us to continue to
be competitive and effective.'
Staff will leave the factory between now and September 9. The company
yesterday called for volunteers, but said there could be compulsory
redundancies.
BAe has been under pressure for many months as orders in the increasingly
competitive communications satellite market have dried up. It has been in
talks since last summer with Anglo-French rival Matra Marconi Space over
merging the companies' satellite operations.
BAe has just completed three commercial contracts and is working on a
fourth. But next year contains only the probability of a contract from the
Ministry of Defence.
BAe is bidding to build Arabsat for the Arab League. If it wins, the number
of job cuts would be reduced by about 140. The winner of that contract
should be announced within three months, BAe said.
The company is a victim of increasing competition in the satellite industry.
The growth of the civil market has attracted new competitors from the
defence sector. At the same time, the proportion of contracts open to
competition has risen as international telephone traffic has increased.
Mr Tim Webb, national officer of the MSF general technical union, said the
announcement was another example of professionally qualified staff losing
their jobs due to government indifference. 'Unlike European partners the
government has given virtually no support to the UK space programme,' he
said.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE National Audit Office, the government spending watchdog, yesterday
called on the BBC World Service to improve its efficiency.
The report paid tribute to the World Service's independence and high
standard of broadcasting. It also found that the organisation - which
broadcasts in 38 languages to an audience of 120m - had 'a generally
satisfactory system of resource planning and financial management, and had
developed comprehensive procedures to assess the effectiveness of its
output'.
The watchdog called for: Further apportioning of overheads to individual
services to improve decision-making.
The continuation of improvements to weak cash flow forecasting. Further
improvements in the use of studios and in deploying studio managers. Greater
use of appraisal techniques to justify capital spending.
Further assessment of the impact of the Pounds 166m spent over the past 10
years to improve the audibility of broadcasts.
The NAO also argued that the World Service might be given more authority to
vary the amount of broadcast time, as long as this did not cost more.
The Foreign Office paid Pounds 143m to fund the World Service in 1991-92 -
not including Pounds 16m for monitoring other foreign broadcasts. At the
moment the number of hours broadcast in particular languages is set out
formally after negotiations between the Foreign Office and the BBC.
The NAO also said it would like to see the World Service move into profit on
its commercial activities.

COMPANIES are beginning to disclose more information on directors'
responsibilities and rewards, according to the latest issue of Company
Reporting, the Edinburgh-based monitoring service of annual accounts.
Reports from Smithkline Beecham, the pharmaceuticals group; Tesco, the
supermarket group; Guinness, and Pearson, which owns the Financial Times,
have published information on directors' remuneration including
performance-related incentive payments, it notes.
Other groups, including Grand Metropolitan, Imperial Chemical Industries,
Sedgwick, BICC, First Leisure and Lonrho have already produced statements on
corporate governance and directors' responsibilities, but provide little
information on how directors are paid.
The details come at a time when the Cadbury Committee on financial aspects
of corporate governance recommended full disclosure of the calculation of
performance-related pay.
Company Reporting also notes that companies are beginning to introduce
cashflow information in their accounts in advance of the Financial Reporting
Standard on cashflow statements, which came into effect in March this year.
It concludes from a sample of 400 companies' annual reports produced since
the standard was issued last September, that more than 29 per cent have
adopted the new standard.

FT  03 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Director urges Europe to welcome Japanese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S leading manufacturers should not be barred from Europe: instead they
should be 'firmly inside Europe as role models', according to Mr Walter
Eltis, director general of the London-based national economic development
office.
In a presentation to the Institut de L'Entreprise in Paris yesterday, Mr
Eltis argued that Europe could learn valuable lessons from British
experience over the past decade in attracting Japanese investors to
transform ailing physics-based industries such as electronics, television
and car manufacture.
Efforts through the 1960s and 1970s to protect the British motor industry
led to the creation of 'a combine which by 1986 was losing Pounds 1bn a year
to produce not very many not very good cars,' he recalls.
He warns that the comparatively poor recent performance of groups like Fiat
and Renault is due to heavy reliance on protected local markets: 'If the
policy of continental Europe is the same as Britain's it will welcome
Japanese manufacturers where (their) competitive edge is exceptional, even
if this leads to the total elimination of the previous producers.
'The ideal way to remedy industrial weaknesses is to get the world's best
into the economy, and to learn from them with the greatest possible
rapidity.'

FT  03 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Amec in HK airport road deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN international consortium including Amec of the UK and the mainland
Chinese-controlled China Fujian Corporation has won a Pounds 260m road
contract as part of Hong Kong's HKDollars 114 (Pounds 8bn) new airport
project.
The award of previous contracts for the airport has prompted criticism that
the project is being used as a final 'pay-day' for UK companies before the
colony is handed over to Chinese rule in in 1997. Mr Alan Cockshaw, Amec
chairman, said yesterday the consortium had received no special treatment.
'Competition for the road contract was intense. As we understand it, ours
was the lowest price but only by a short head.'
Other members of the winning consortium included Downer of New Zealand,
Eltin of Australia, International Water &amp; Electric Corporation and Universal
Dockyard, both of Hong Kong. Among the rival bids were separate consortia
led by Bouygues of France and Kumagai Gumi of Japan.
The contract for work on the 6.5km Tai Ho section of the North Lantau
Expressway, forming part of the road-rail system to link the Lantau Island
airport with Kowloon and Hong Kong Island, is due to be completed in 1996.
The consortium is also bidding for the remaining 7km section of the North
Lantau Expressway which will carry a six-lane highway, as well as provision
for an airport railway and a service road.
The involvement of the Hong Kong subsidiary of China Fujian Corporation,
which will provide dredging expertise, may help placate criticism from China
that UK companies are being favoured.
Complaints resurfaced last month when the airport authority awarded the
contract to build one of the world's largest suspension bridges to an
Anglo-Japanese consortium led by Trafalgar House, the UK construction,
property, hotels and shipping group.
The consortium, which had bid HKDollars 7.14bn, was awarded the contract
even though a bid from a consortium led by Hyundai was HKDollars 2.43bn
lower. The Hong Kong authorities said the Korean company had failed to meet
requirements designed to ensure the winning bidder had sufficient capital to
complete the contract.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Mexican government has initiated anti-dumping cases against flat-rolled
steel producers in the US, Damian Fraser reports from Mexico City. Mexico
would be able to impose countervailing duties on all US flat steel producers
if the claims are upheld.
Its two flat steel producers, Hysla and Altos Hornos, brought the case
against USX, National, LTV and Bethlehem, and two US trading companies. They
claim the US companies have been selling hot-rolled, cold-rolled and
plate-in-coil steel below cost, making it impossible for the Mexicans to
compete fairly.
Mexico, unlike the US, has been unwilling until now to use its anti-dumping
laws. US cement companies brought a case against Mexican cement exporters
two years ago. The Mexicans suffered countervailing duties, and have since
been effectively blocked out of the US market. The cement case encouraged
the Mexicans to press for a reform of the US anti-dumping laws as part of
the North American Free Trade Agreement. But the US refused to budge.

FT  03 JUN 92 / A Guide to the Rio Maze
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WHAT is the Earth Summit?
A UN-sponsored gathering of 185 countries to address the world's growing
environmental problems, many of which now have global rather than national
ramifications. It will last 12 days. For the first 10 days officials will
negotiate, and on the last two more than 100 heads of state and government
will attend the formal signing ceremony.
Is it just about the environment?
Its official name is the UN Conference on the Environment and Development
(UNCED). The inclusion of word development emphasises the close links
between the two issues.
What is it supposed to achieve?
High ideals have been steadily whittled down by compromise during
preparations. The summit was supposed to approve several international
treaties to clean the atmosphere and protect the world's plant and animal
species. But these have been so reduced that many people have denounced it
as a waste of time, among them Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment
commissioner.
So what will actually happen?
There are two draft treaties on the negotiating table. One addresses threats
to the climate from greenhouse gases. This will commit signatories to
formulating plans for reducing their carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels
by the year 2000. Originally it was supposed to place a binding obligation
on countries to achieve these targets. Softer wording was insisted on by the
US, which is opposed to over-strict regulation. The treaty also provides for
wealthy countries to help poorer nations.
The second treaty aims to protect the planet's biological diversity. It
obliges signa-tories to take steps to preserve plant and animal life but
also gives them the right to exploit them. The tension between these two
conflicting aims has made the draft difficult to negotiate, and its
provisions are not as tough as many hoped.
However, the US announced that it would not sign even this watered down
version of the treaty, and other industrialised nations have expressed
doubts.
Generally the countries with the greatest biological diversity are third
world countries which are mainly interested in obtaining the technology to
exploit it. This has raised further issues, such as protection of rights to
this technology and the extent to which rich countries will help the poor
gain access to it.
There was to have been a third treaty on protection of forests, but this was
dropped because third world countries objected to being told not to cut down
trees which were essential to their economies. The intention now is to have
a legally non-binding declaration of principles, but this is also proving
hard to negotiate, showing that preservation of the rain forests is probably
the toughest issue on the Rio agenda.
Anything else?
The summit will also try to approve Agenda 21, an 800-page plan to clean up
the environment. This will address issues such as water, forests and land,
but will also deal with poverty, and even women's rights (for which read the
thorny question of population control) and the role of children. Although
three quarters of this plan has been approved in the preparatory meetings,
the remaining quarter still promises tough bargaining.
If everyone agrees the environment is under threat, why is agreement at the
summit proving so difficult?
Countries have sharply differing perceptions about what should be done. Most
of them want a cleaner world, provided someone else makes the sacrifice. It
comes down to where you strike the balance between economic growth and
protecting the environment. Industrial countries tend towards the green
view, but developing countries see environmental protection as a luxury.
Why, then, is President George Bush so cool on the summit?
The US administration fears the summit could trigger a stifling wave of
environmental regulation, and land rich countries with heavy commitments to
aid the poor in the name of the environment. Mr Bush also wants to protect
trade and the patent rights of US companies.
We hear a lot about sustainable development. What is that?
It is the economic theory which argues that the world must grow in such a
way as to leave its resources unimpaired for future generations. It sounds
good in theory but is difficult in practice because growth consumes
resources almost by definition. Critics also say it is more important to
deal with today's pressing problems, particularly poverty, than worry about
trees for one's grandchildren.
What is likely to come of it all?
The key point will be what sort of machinery the summit sets in motion to
hold participants to the pledges they make. People stress that Rio is the
beginning of a process, not the end.
How quickly will it happen?
Some participants are looking for kick-start measures to implement Rio
decisions quickly. But, more likely, the event will make little difference
to people's day-to-day lives. In the longer run, though, it could create
pressures on governments which would lead to far-reaching changes.
What will the clean-up cost and who will pay?
The UN has estimated that the global clean-up will cost more than Dollars
600bn (Pounds 333.3bn) a year, Dollars 125bn of which would be in the form
of aid from rich countries to help the poor. Most third world countries are
looking for big promises of aid in Rio, but the industrial countries insist
there will be 'no pledges'.

FT  03 JUN 92 / 'Greatest' gathering of heads of state in history

   EVERYBODY knows George Bush will attend the Earth Summit
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
if only because he took so long to make up his mind. But who else will be
present at what has been billed as the greatest gathering of heads of state
and governments in history? Invitations went to 185 of them.
We know the king and queen of Sweden are attending, because they have
already arrived. Also from Europe, John Major is coming, but Prince Charles,
for whom this might have been a suitable event and who is friends with
President Collor of Brazil, is not. Chancellor Kohl of Germany will put in
an appearance, as will the prime minister of Italy (the name has been left
blank in the official list in case there is a change of government in the
meantime).
President Mitterand is expected, though there is some uncertainty. His
security people have said he cannot make the road journey to the conference
centre because it passes through two tunnels. The leaders of Austria,
Denmark, Finland, Greece, Ireland, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands,
Norway, Portugal, Spain (where King Carlos is also 'considering coming')
have all accepted.
A tricky one is the European Community. After Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the
environment commissioner tore up his air ticket in a fit of pique, the most
senior Brussels representative is the little-known Mr Abel Matutes,
commissioner for north-south relations.
The Holy See, whose controversial position on population control issues
which loom so large on the Rio agenda, will also attend, though not in the
person of the Pope. Instead one of his top cardinals will come.
Japan sees the Earth Summit as a chance to trumpet its green credentials,
and is emphasising the fact by sending not just Prime Minister Miyazawa, but
also two former ones, Mr Noboru Takeshita and Mr Toshiki Kaifu.
Virtually every country in the third world is represented. The absences are
more notable. Civil war-torn Afghanistan has yet to respond (so, for similar
reasons, has Yugoslavia). Fidel Castro is coming, though for security
reasons that is a secret. South Africa and the Sudan have yet to decide.
The only problem the organisers must solve is that every country leader has
the right to speak, and 20 minutes per person has been suggested. That would
make four days of non-stop speeches.

US immigration authorities routinely beat and abuse undocumented Mexican
migrants and occasionally shoot, torture and sexually abuse them, claims
Americas Watch, the human rights organisation, writes Damian Fraser in
Mexico City.
When complaints are filed, the US government is as 'defensive and
unyielding' as countries with poor human rights records, the group says.
Its report documents the case of one officer who, during a six to seven-year
period was involved in theft, two 'vehicle incidents,' one of which resulted
in the death of a migrant, two serious assaults on farm workers, and the
violent homicide of a Mexican minor.
The agent still works for border control.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Earth Summit cost estimated at Dollars 37m: Conference seen
as chance to improve Brazil's poor environmental image
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL is footing the bill for what promises to be the biggest party on
earth. Mr Flavio Perri, the conference organiser, estimates the total cost
to the government at Cr105bn (Dollars 37m) - a drain on a bankrupt Treasury
and a country where even the presidency no longer serves coffee.
The Brazilians have even had to bear the travel expenses of some of their
guests and have so far paid out more than Dollars 2m for UN officials.
Mr Marcos Azambuja, Brazil's main negotiator, believes the money has been
well spent. He sees the Earth Summit as a chance to improve the country's
poor image in terms of environment and security. He also hopes it will put
Rio de Janeiro back on the map as a key tourist destination and a future
international conference centre.
But he says Brazil's parlous economic situation means that organisation has
had to be done on the cheap. 'Like anyone inviting friends to dinner, we'd
like to offer more to impress.' In fact, just three months before the
conference, the budget was halved.
The main outlay was on extending Rio's communications network and improving
security. The conference centre, which had been used only for exhibitions
and rock concerts, had to be renovated. Translation services have been
installed and an enormous round table for heads of state built. So stretched
was the Brazilian purse that its own delegation is housed in a
pre-fabricated unit with no roof. Other delegations enjoy air conditioning
and carpets.
Brazil has accepted donations from the private sector: 285 cars from
Volkswagen and 10 buses from Scania. The federal police chipped in, lending
300 cars.
The real cost has lain with the Rio state government, which has been hard at
work painting and resurfacing roads, restoring parks and installing
streetlighting.
Mr Roberto D'Avila, the state environment secretary, estimates that the
state has spent Dollars 500m but he says this was for already-needed
investments. 'Hosting such a big event meant that priorities became
super-priorities and things which had waited for 20 years only happened
because of the summit'. He gives as examples renovation of the airport and
new highway construction.
The influx of about 30,000 visitors is stimulating the private sector,
causing one Rio shopkeeper to comment yesterday: 'We are starting to like
this green movement. To us green means dollars.'

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TWO national public opinion polls released yesterday put Mr Ross Perot, the
prospective independent candidate, first and last in the race for the US
presidency.
A Washington Post-ABC poll gave Mr Perot 34 per cent, President George Bush
31 per cent and Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas 29 per cent. A CBS tally
had Mr Bush in the lead with 35 per cent, against 27 per cent for Mr Clinton
and 26 per cent for Mr Perot.
The polls were published on the day of the final party primaries in six
states, including California, the biggest.
Since Mr Perot is on no ballot, only rough estimates of his popularity will
be available through exit polling and, where allowed, in votes for
uncommitted delegates. The write-in option is largely precluded.
The Post-ABC survey, which said Mr Perot's lead was statistically
insignificant nationally, is most interesting for its regional breakdown. It
showed Mr Perot ahead in the west - followed by Mr Clinton and then Mr Bush
 -and tied with the president in the north-east, where Mr Clinton trailed
appreciably.
However, the likely Democratic nominee led in the south, followed by Mr
Perot and Mr Bush. In the mid-west Mr Bush held a small lead over Mr Perot
with Mr Clinton third.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Rabuka named premier of Fiji
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN

<DATELINE>
   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Sitiveni Rabuka, the former army officer who led two coups in 1987, was
yesterday appointed prime minister of Fiji at the head of a coalition
government elected under a racially-biased constitution.
The appointment, announced by President Sir Penaia Ganilau, followed three
days of manoeuvring for the premiership between Mr Rabuka and Mr Josevata
Kamikamica, a former finance minister.
Both are members of the Soqosoqo ni Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party, which
supports the political supremacy of the country's 345,000 ethnic Fijians,
who account for about 48 per cent of the population.
The SVT won 30 of the 37 seats reserved for ethnic Fijians in the 70-seat
House of Representatives. The more extreme Fijian Nationalist United Front
won five seats. Two were taken by independents.
Mr Kamikamica, a former civil servant, was the preferred choice of the
president, and was regarded as more acceptable to the 340,000 ethnic Indians
who account for 47 per cent of the population.
However, Mr Rabuka's appointment was assured by the support of Mr Mahendra
Chaudhry, leader of the trade union based Fiji Labour Party, which won 13 of
the 27 seats reserved for Indians.
Ironically, Mr Chaudhry was one of several Indian leaders detained by Mr
Rabuka when the army twice intervened in 1987 to overthrow a coalition
government dominated by Indians.
The key element of the deal was an agreement to review the constitution,
which seeks to entrench ethnic Fijian dominance through unequal
parliamentary representation and an ethnic Fijian Senate with significant
veto powers. The prime minister and president must both be ethnic Fijians.
Mr Chaudhry also extracted from Mr Rabuka an undertaking to review
restrictions on trade union activity introduced by the interim government
which has ruled Fiji since December 1987.
The deal is likely to give Mr Chaudhry a bigger role in Fijian Indian
affairs than the formerly dominant National Federation Party (NFP), which
won 14 seats. However, Labour stopped short of entering a formal coalition.
Mr Rabuka will govern with the support of the two Fijian independents and
five MPs elected by the 35,000 Europeans, Chinese, and other races.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Japanese companies cut capital spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S Ministry of International Trade and Industry yesterday published
further evidence of deepening pessimism among Japanese businessmen.
Capital spending by big companies in the fiscal year from April will fall
for the first time since 1986-87, according to a ministry survey.
Even though the expected decline is small - 1.4 per cent - the ministry
believes the negative figure is ominous because it indicates a marked change
in sentiment among businessmen. In the previous survey last autumn, the
ministry had forecast a 1.2 per cent increase in investment.
Miti's report comes at a time of intense debate within the government about
possible action to counter the slow down in the Japanese economy. Miti
officials, many with close industry links, are among the most vociferous
supporters of government action to stimulate growth. But the Bank of Japan
believes further cuts in interest rates are now unnecessary and the Ministry
of Finance dismisses as premature demands for increased public spending.
The survey shows that capital spending by leading companies rose 6.8 per
cent in the year to March, the smallest increase since the mid-1980s. For
the current year Miti predicts a 8.9 per cent decline in capital spending by
large manufacturing companies and a 6 per cent decline in investment by
service industries.
Electronics companies are cutting investment by a full 26.4 per cent and car
makers by 9.8 per cent. Paper manufacturers, operating in a highly cyclical
industry, are planning a 30.7 per cent reduction. The overall reductions
would be more severe were it not for planned increases in spending by
electric power utilities and other quasi-public institutions.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AUSTRALIA'S recovery from recession is under way, but the economy remains
weak and growth over the remainder of the year is likely to be slow,
government figures indicated yesterday.
The quarterly national accounts showed that gross domestic product grew by
0.6 per cent in the three months to the end of March, following growth of
0.7 per cent in the December quarter, revised from 0.3 per cent.
Further revisions, following the introduction of a new GDP measure,
suggested that the economy stopped contracting in the three months to
September, after five quarters of decline.
The GDP figures follow the announcement on Monday of balance of payments
data for April which showed a fall in the monthly current account deficit to
ADollars 897m (Pounds 377m), seasonally adjusted, from a revised ADollars
992m in March.
The deficit for the financial year at the end of June appears likely to
total less than ADollars 12bn, compared to ADollars 15.7bn in 1990-91, and a
record ADollars 21bn in the previous year.
Economists say inflation is also likely to remain near the current level of
1.5 per cent for the rest of the calendar year.
The improving economic outlook will boost the prospects of Mr Paul Keating's
Labor government, which must hold a federal election by the middle of next
year.

<DATELINE>
   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Allan Hawkins, founder of the finance group, Equiticorp, and six former
colleagues went on trial in Auckland yesterday on fraud and conspiracy
charges relating to the collapse of the group in 1987 with millions of
dollars of debt.
The case before a judge sitting alone is expected to create legal history as
it is expected to last up to two years, with the reading of the case against
them alone due to take three days.
The case involves an investigation into the startling growth of Equiticorp
from a small finance company in 1984 to an international group with assets
worth NZDollars 4bn (Pounds 1.17bn) and interests as diverse as Guinness
Peat in Britain, a Hong Kong listed company, Capitalcorp International,
merchant banking in Australia, and control of New Zealand Steel.
Equiticorp ran into difficulties in October 1987, on the day of the stock
market crash when it signed a deal to buy 87 per cent of New Zealand Steel
for Dollars NZ327m from the government. Events surrounding the New Zealand
Steel deal are central to criminal charges against Mr Hawkins and his legal
adviser, Mr Paul Darvell, a partner in one of Auckland's largest companies.
They and five others are also charged with conspiracy to defraud in relation
to the floatation of Capitalcorp International in Hong Kong, and to
management fees allegedly taken after the sale of shares in its Australian
companies.
An all-encompassing conspiracy charge against all seven men alleging they
were involved in a money laundering scheme was introduced by the Serious
Fraud Office.
When the trial is over, some of the defendants will face a NZDollars 564m
civil claim by the Equiticorp statutory managers who took over Equiticorp's
reins when it collapsed.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Labour's hopes rise in Israeli election: Hugh Carnegy
assesses the prospects for the two main parties in the June 23 poll
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS television campaigning got underway last night in the battle for the June
23 Israeli general election, the slogan of the opposition Labour party
blared 'Israel is waiting for Rabin'.
Certainly Palestinians in the occupied territories, the wider Arab world,
and, albeit silently, the US government, are hoping Labour's brash assertion
is right that Mr Yizhak Rabin, its new leader, is about to sweep the party
back into power.
Mr Rabin has promised to abandon the ideological extremes of the Likud
party, in government since 1977, substituting its refusal to give up any
land with a commitment to trade territory for peace in the hitherto
deadlocked Middle East peace negotiations. He says he would curb Jewish
settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip and reach an agreement for
interim Palestinian self-rule in the territories within six months.
Buoyed by favourable opinion polls and a stuttering performance by Likud,
Labour is showing greater verve and confidence than it has for years. But is
Israel indeed waiting to put Mr Rabin back in office (he was previously an
unremarkable prime minister in the mid-1970s)? Is it really any closer to
resolving the bitter internal divisions over what to do about the
territories that have persisted for 25 years since Gen Rabin, then chief of
staff, led Israel to victory in the June 1967 Six Day War?
The paradoxical answer may be yes to the former, but no to the latter,
leaving a question mark over whether Israel will be able to move forward
decisively in the peace process.
In contrast to Labour's well-organised campaign, the Likud is suffering the
fatigue of long years in office, and is beset by angry feuding among
potential successors as party leader to the tough but uninspiring Mr Shamir.
Labour has apparently successfully shrugged off Likud allegations that Mr
Rabin is a heavy drinker who suffered a nervous collapse before the 1967
war.
Opinion polls have shown Mr Rabin as easily the most popular candidate for
prime minister. There is plenty of anecdotal evidence of widespread
dissatisfaction with Likud.
Labour faces a hard struggle nonetheless. Neither Labour nor Likud has ever
won a majority in the 120-seat Knesset and neither will come close this
time. Mr Rabin's stated target is that Labour and its allies in the smaller
parties will win at least a 60-seat block and then induce at least some or
all of the three religious parties into a majority coalition based on
Labour's agenda.
Labour's prospective allies are Meretz, a new unified alignment of three
'dovish' liberal and leftist parties, and three parties which draw their
support from the country's Arab minority. Even Labour supporters are
sceptical that together the 'block' can add five new seats to the 55 they
won in the 1988 election in a system where swings tend to be marginal.
'It means Labour, Meretz and the Arab parties must all achieve the very best
they are capable of and I'm afraid that is too much to hope for,' says Mr
Nimrod Novik, a senior Labour campaign leader in the last election.
Things are far from rosy on the right. Apart from Likud's difficulties,
Tehiya, Moledet and Tzomet, the three extreme right-wing parties previously
in coalition with Likud, failed to agree on a vote-maximising election pact.
But polls show about one- third of voters are still undecided. Likud, its
campaign starting to look more coherent, is confident many waverers will
return, especially once it has hammered home its message that a Rabin
government would be hostage to 'doves'.
'There is anger in the field against the Likud, no doubt about it,' says Mr
Rafi Shitreet, Likud campaign manager in the southern city of Beersheba, a
Likud stronghold. 'But Labour can't make a coalition without the extreme
left and the Arabs. People know how to count. They won't vote for that.'
In fact, there are strong grounds for believing Mr Rabin doesn't want it
either. He has always been uncomfortable in the company of doves. Since the
mid- and late-1980s when Labour and Likud were in coalition, he has believed
that they can move forward together in the peace negotiations at least to
the first stage of limited Palestinian self rule.
Mr Rabin may well be happy for Labour just to overtake Likud as the biggest
party (the difference was only 40 to 39 seats in 1988). He would then seek
to cajole the Likud into a grand coalition in which he was prime minister
and clear senior partner. He would attempt to go forward in the peace talks,
but the old divisions about the long-term solution would remain unresolved.
Whatever happens, forming a coalition will take time, as it always does in
Israel. 'It will take a minimum of six weeks - more likely eight to 10,'
predicted Mr Novik, a veteran of coalition wrangling.

FT  03 JUN 92 / ANC economic policy praised by government
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG, TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE South African government yesterday described new economic policies
adopted by the African National Congress last weekend as 'pragmatic'.
The ANC concluded a conference on Sunday where a comprehensive set of policy
guidelines was adopted, revising the organisation's economic stance for the
first time since 1955.
Mr Derek Keys, the minister of finance, said ANC economic policies
represented a 'very material advance' on those of two years ago. He said
they meant 'it should not be impossible to agree a growth strategy'.
His comments raise the prospect for the first time of a constructive
economic dialogue between the National Party and the ANC.
It improves the chances of agreement being reached in the Economic Forum,
set up last month to map out future strategy. The forum is made up of
representatives from the business community, trade unions and the
government.
He said there were three economic problems the government was in a position
to address. These were the high individual tax burden, high interest rates
and inflation.
Mr Keys said a lower level of government spending would help alleviate these
problems and said he would begin his campaign 'to reduce in real terms the
level of government spending' this month.
On corporate taxes, Mr Keys said he would favour the dispensation that gives
the best growth prospects. 'It may be the one with lower tax rates, but it
may not be.' He argued that areas where co-operation was required to make
progress were unemployment and investment.
He warned that what he called the 'economic civil war' had to be stopped if
the South African economy was going to recover. This involved stopping
political wars being fought on economic terrain - such as over the issue of
sanctions.
He also called for 'sensible wage bargaining'.
Mr Keys said South Africa needed to invest more than 25 per cent of its
gross domestic product (compared to 18-19 per cent now) if the growth rate
was to keep pace with the birth rate.
Achieving this required greater investor confidence, he said.
On foreign investment Mr Keys said: 'I don't think in practice it will be
found possible to impose conditions on foreign investment that foreign
investment doesn't want to have imposed on it.'
The South African president, FW de Klerk, will face calls in Tokyo today
formally to scrap the 'honorary white' status granted to Japanese more than
30 years ago, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Human rights groups want the prime minister, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, to discuss
the 'shameful' issue with Mr De Klerk. Mr Akira Kusuhara, a human rights
spokesman, said the status was introduced in the 1960s at a time when Japan
was experiencing high growth which South Africa wanted to take advantage of.

<TEXT>
MR Ali Akbar Velayati, the Iranian foreign minister, began his first
official visit to Lebanon yesterday with a series of meetings with the
government, demonstrating Iran's new willingness to deal directly with the
Lebanese authorities - to the possible detriment of Iran's allies in the
Shia Moslem Hizbollah movement.
Hizbollah refused to participate in the government, formed last month, on
the grounds that it was 'corrupt'.
Although Mr Velayati told reporters that he was not discussing the
liberation of two German hostages believed held by Mr Abdul-Hadi Hamadi, a
prominent Hizbollah member, his visit encouraged speculation that the two
Germans would soon be free.
Germany and the European Community have frozen several hundred million
dollars in reconstruction aid to Lebanon pending the liberation of Mr
Heinrich Streubig, 50, and Mr Thomas Kemptner, 30. Both men have been held
for three years and their kidnappers are demanding the freedom of Mr
Hamadi's brothers Mohammed and Abbas, convicted in Germany of hijacking,
kidnapping and murder. Mr Velayati is to visit Germany later this month.
The Lebanese government, which was excluded from earlier hostage
negotiations, this year established a special commission to work for the
liberation of Mr Streubig and Mr Kemptner. A Lebanese delegation travelled
to Tehran three months ago to ask Iran to use its influence over Hizbollah
to seek their freedom.
Mr Velayati said yesterday that it was his understanding that the Lebanese
government, like Iran, supported 'popular resistance' against the Israeli
occupation of southern Lebanon.
But Mr Fares Boueiz, the Lebanese foreign minister, recently demanded that
Hizbollah 'co-ordinate' its attacks with Lebanese diplomatic efforts in
hopes of ending Israeli reprisals that killed 25 people and wounded 63 in
the last two weeks of May. Mr Velayati will address a rally commemorating
the third anniversary of the death of Ayatollah Khomeini in Beirut today.
Israel shelled guerrilla-held villages in south Lebanon yesterday and sent
reconnaissance aircraft over the area and the Bekaa valley in the east of
the country where Hizbollah militants are active, agencies report.
Security sources said that Israeli gunners and their South Lebanon Army
allies opened fire on several villages near the Litani river.
Meanwhile, the Israeli defence minister, Mr Moshe Arens, warned Lebanese
civilians yesterday that they were at risk if they lived near leaders of
Hizbollah.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Indonesian banks face pressures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JAKARTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A REPORT criticising Indonesia's banking sector has added to bankers'
expectations that the next year will see a series of mergers as banks try to
reduce costs, rationalise loan portfolios and meet higher capital adequacy
requirements.
The report, by Jardine Fleming Nusantara, the Indonesian subsidiary of Hong
Kong-based Jardine Fleming merchant bank, says it has 'very significant
reservations about the (bad debt) provisions of banks' brought about by
'irregular and imprudent lending policies', the report says.
Officials at Bank Indonesia, the central bank, estimate the banking sector's
level of bad and doubtful debts has increased from 3.9 per cent of total
loan portfolios in 1990 to 5.9 per cent last year.
Economists at donor agencies say that bad debts of the five state-owned
commercial banks, which account for half the sector's total assets, are
between 15-25 per cent of their respective portfolios. 'The banking sector
is a major worry. They (Bank Indonesia) have to rationalise it somehow. It's
not sustainable,' says Dr Mari Pangestu, head of economic affairs at the
Centre for Strategic and International Studies in Jakarta.
The sector experienced explosive growth following a de-regulatory decree in
1988. Outstanding credits of the sector totalled Rupiah 113,608bn (Pounds
30.56bn) last December, up from Rp44,000bn at the end of 1988.
Bankers say, however, that poor credit analysis has plagued many private
banks, while state banks have made loans on political, rather than
financial, grounds. Some banks are also capitalising interest payments on
loans to avoid categorising them as non-performing, they say.
Jardine Fleming estimates that 'banks are at present providing about 1.0-1.5
per cent (of productive assets) for doubtful debt', a figure supported by
bankers in Jakarta. It warns that raising provisions to accommodate actual
bad debt would have 'a devastating impact on profitability'.
Its report looks at seven leading quoted banks and estimates that, if 3 per
cent of performing assets were provided for bad debt, four banks would have
recorded a loss in 1991, while the profits of the other three would have
been more than halved. All seven banks reported net profits last year but
provided just 0.64-1.65 per cent of performing assets for bad debt.
There will be 'many mergers with Bank Indonesia's assistance', Dr Pangestu
predicts, a view shared by bankers in Jakarta who believe that the central
bank will orchestrate a controlled shake-out of the sector. Bankers do not
believe there will be a banking crisis and say confidence in the system
remains strong.
Pressure on the sector will increase, however, with banks having to meet new
capital adequacy requirements of 8 per cent of total assets by December,
1993, up from 5 per cent currently set by the central bank. Most severely
affected will be the five state-owned commercial banks which, bankers say,
will require a capital injection of about Dollars 2bn.
A government decree should help some private banks to raise capital. It will
allow foreigners to purchase up to 49 per cent of listed shares of quoted
banks. Foreigners are at present barred from holding shares in quoted banks.
The Indonesian military has shot dead Mr M L Prawar, the military commander
of the rebel Free Papua Movement (OPM) in Irian Jaya, the state-owned Antara
news agency reported yesterday, writes William Keeling. Mr Prawar was
ambushed by a 13-member special task force in Skouw-Wuting area which
borders Papua New Guinea (PNG). Irian Jaya was transferred to Indonesia from
Dutch rule in 1963 and the OPM was formed in 1977 to seek unification with
PNG.

MR Farouk Kaddoumi, the Palestine Liberation Organisation's foreign

leadership.
Confirmation of Mr Kaddoumi's heir-apparent status came yesterday when Mr
Faisal Husseini, the senior Palestinian in the occupied territories, told
reporters that the PLO 'foreign minister' was in charge while Mr Yassir
Arafat was in hospital.
Speculation about a possible alternative to Mr Arafat has been rife after
his brush with death in an air crash in April and was spurred by news of
emergency surgery this week to remove a blood clot from his brain.
The Hebrew-speaking Mr Kaddoumi, a founder of the mainstream Fatah faction
of the PLO with Mr Arafat, heads the organisation's Political Department, in
effect its foreign ministry.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Russia to scrap special rouble rate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA is about to take the first step towards making the rouble internally
convertible by abolishing the special exchange rate of 55 roubles to the
dollar from July 1.
President Boris Yeltsin is reported to be about to sign a document ordering
all enterprises to sell 50 per cent of their hard currency proceeds to the
central bank at the market exchange rate of 85 roubles to the dollar. At
present, enterprises must sell 40 per cent of hard currency proceeds at the
special rate of 55 roubles.
The unifying of the rouble rates has long been proposed by the International
Monetary Fund as a necessary first step in the currency reform. However, it
will increase prices for imported goods for enterprises and may still be
delayed by heavy lobbying against it.
The president's move comes as the Russian reform programme is under attack
in parliament and industry, and as the government is being forced to make
big concessions to the industrial lobby. It faces hard bargaining with the
IMF in Washington next week on the letter of intent detailing its economic
programme which it must agree with the Fund before it has access to Dollars
24bn from the IMF and western countries.
Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister, said the July 1 moves must
be synchronised with the Dollars 6bn credits, part of the Dollars 24bn
package, designed to stabilise the rouble. 'Everything depends on the IMF
credits,' said Mr Gaidar.
He also announced a 'relaxation and a gradual end to limits on credits to
enterprises'. He has promised that Russia will print Rbs140bn this month,
and that a new Rbs5,000 banknote will be introduced from July to end the
shortage of cash which has meant workers going without pay.
Mr Yeltsin yesterday despatched Rbs4bn to the Kuzbass coalfields and Rbs25m
to the Krasnoyarsk chemical plant to pay wages and stop threatened strikes.
He also sent an unspecified sum to the Tyumen oilfields, where workers have
threatened stoppages.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Crimean Tatars try to rebuild life at home: The returning
community, writes Chrystia Freeland, is shoved to the sidelines by the
Slavic giants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRYSTIA FREELAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LESS THAN a mile away from the magnificent, turreted palace of the Khan of
Crimea, in the sandy fields of Bakchesaray, his descendants live in
fly-infested, tar-paper squatters shacks.
The Khan's Palace, wreathed in Arabic script, was the centre of a Moslem
society which prospered on the peninsula for five centuries. That society
was shattered in 1783 when Catherine II annexed Crimea, in a move which
underscored the decline of the Khanate's protector, the Ottoman empire, and
the rise of its historic enemy, Imperial Russia.
Two hundred years later, the lush Crimean peninsula is again the pivot for a
larger struggle, this time between the shrinking Russian empire and the
nascent Ukrainian nation.
As the two Slav giants fight it out, the Crimean Tatars, whose
250,000-strong community was deported en masse by Stalin in 1944, are trying
to rebuild their society. 'As soon as we were born, we began to dream about
returning to our native land,' explains 38-year-old Seitumer Bekirov, one of
the nearly 200,000 Crimean tatars who have made the difficult journey from
central Asia and Kazakhstan to their homeland over the past five years.
Mr Bekirov was born in Uzbekistan in 1944; his family tried to return to
Crimea in 1970 but was forced out. Undaunted, they spent the next two
decades in Kherson, a Ukrainian city chosen for its proximity to Crimea.
In 1990, Mr Bekirov was finally permitted to return to his homeland, in
which he had never lived. He spent six months in a primitive, dirt-floored
hut built in a vacant field without water or electricity before he and 600
other protesters forced the Crimean government to formally turn the land
over to the Tatars.
Although the Ukrainian government has earmarked Rbs3.2bn to subsidise the
resettlement, Crimean Tatars find their efforts blocked at every turn by the
communist-dominated local government.
Tatars have no right to reclaim the homes from which they were deported,
they have been granted parched fields on which to build new houses only by
squatting on them for months, and, despite a Ukrainian law returning
religious buildings to their original use, the Tatars were able to reclaim
one of the three remaining Crimean mosques only by physically occupying it.
To add insult to injury, even the gorgeous Khan's Palace is in jeopardy: the
Crimean government is trying to sell it to private shopkeepers.
Blue eyes dancing in his tanned face, Mr Bekirov, who moved to Crimea with
his wife, two children, parents and in-laws in tow, shrugs off the
difficulties. 'For us, it is worth it,' he says.
Outnumbered by Russians by nearly ten to one, the Tatars oppose a renewal of
an independent Crimea as enjoyed under the Khanate. Mr Mustafa Jemilev, the
diminutive, 49-year-old chairman of the Mejlis, the Crimean Tartars' elected
council, says: 'The greatest danger is that we will be left one-on-one with
these Russian chauvinists.'
Nursing a suspicion of Russia bred by Tatar history and reinforced by the 15
years he spent in Soviet prisons for championing the Tatar cause, Mr Jemilev
is equally opposed to unification with a Russia, where, he says, 'there is
very little sober thinking, only imperialist thinking.'
The Tatars' only option, it is argued, is to insist that Crimea remain part
of Ukraine. Mr Jemilev says that the Tatars' unique claim to the peninsula
should be acknowledged by granting Crimea national-territorial status with a
bicameral parliament in which the Tatars would control one house.
If Tatar demands are not met, Mr Jemilev warns, his people could turn to
more drastic tactics. Their leadership is considering declaring the Crimean
Tatars 'a people fighting for national liberation,' a status which, in the
view of the Mejlis, would render all Crimean laws invalid and give the
Tatars the right to resort to force.
Mr Jemilev says: 'Crimea is not just some pretty place for us. For us, it is
everything.'

FT  03 JUN 92 / Emu marathon a stiff test of Greek stamina
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR GREECE, the path to economic convergence with its European partners
resembles a marathon course over a boulder-strewn mountainside.
After a decade of economic mismanagement, the country's chances of catching
up with the rest of the Community by 1997, depend on deep spending cuts to
bring the public sector debt from an estimated 140 per cent of gross
domestic product this year to the Maastricht target of under 60 per cent.
The adjustment will be painful, says Mr Stefanos Manos, economy minister.
The first draft of Greece's convergence plan calls for abolishing 40,000
public sector jobs (about 8 per cent of the total payroll) by 1994 and
freezing pension payments for the next five years.
The plan also proposes a one percentage point cut in real wages each year
until 1997, and postponement of income tax reductions included in a bill now
before parliament.
The overall aim is to achieve savings of Dr200bn (Pounds 570m) a year over
the next five years, according to government advisers. Besides lowering the
debt, these measures should reduce the public sector deficit, which totalled
16 per cent of GDP last year, to the 3 per cent level required for Emu
participation.
The Greek inflation rate, at 16 per cent, is three times the Community
average. But it appears to be on a steady downward trend, suggesting that
the drachma will be able to join the wide band of the exchange rate
mechanism by 1994. Greece would then stand a reasonable chance of meeting
the Emu criterion of an inflation rate no more than 1.5 per cent above the
EC's three best performers.
Joining Emu at the outset is crucial if Greece is to avoid being permanently
relegated to the lower rung of a two-tier Community. Officially, it is
already the poorest EC member. In fact, the size of the black economy, now
estimated at about 40 per cent of GDP, gives Greeks a standard of living
comparable with the Irish.
Though Greeks are overwhelmingly in favour of European political and
economic union, according to opinion polls, it is not clear how many
sacrifices they are ready to make. Public sector unions are already
preparing strikes in response to last month's announcement of sweeping
reforms of the pension system.
Much depends on whether the conservative government can build a consensus on
the need to achieve convergence. If the opposition Socialists are willing to
accept its costs, in the form of higher unemployment and fewer welfare
benefits, the task will be easier.
On the other hand, the outlook is considerably brightened by anticipation of
increased EC financial support, which would help boost economic growth to
3-3.5 per cent annually. Under the draft convergence plan Greece must
maintain a growth rate of at least one point higher than the EC average in
order to narrow the gap with its partners.
This is an ambitious but not impossible target provided it can obtain the
maximum amount of EC funding available. Greek officials speak of receiving
about Ecu2.2bn (Pounds 1.53bn) from the 'cohesion fund' for poorer members
and Ecu12bn from the existing structural funds by 1997.
At present the country has fewer than 50 miles of motorway, a rail network
on which express trains average 40mph and a telephone system heavily reliant
on east European equipment from the 1960s.
'Rapid modernisation of the infrastructure is a vital part of convergence.
Otherwise we don't stand a chance of keeping up,' says a Greek official.
Greeks favour EC union, but are they ready to pay the price, asks Kerin Hope

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE last-ditch battle to keep Germany in the multi-national European fighter
aircraft (EFA) project was stepped up yesterday, with a strong hint from the
aerospace industry that withdrawal would cost jobs in the Hamburg
constituency of Mr Volker Ruhe, the defence minister. Mr Ruhe is determined
to axe the fighter project from his budget, writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
Mr Jugen Schrempp, chief executive of Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa), said loss
of the company's main military aircraft contract would require a complete
rethink of the split in manufacturing between Hamburg, where Dasa has most
of its civil production, and Munich, where military manufacture is
concentrated. A negative decision by the end of the month would also mean
the first of up to 10,000 lost jobs before the end of the year, he said.
The key decision on the aircraft will be taken probably on June 23, at
meetings of the parliamentary groups of the ruling parties, and not on June
16 as originally proposed. The latter date coincides with the opening of the
Berlin international aerospace exhibition.

FT  03 JUN 92 / Bank accused of savings cartel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE BANK, Germany's biggest bank and one of Europe's most powerful
financial institutions, has been accused of operating a domestic cartel with
public sector savings institutions to keep interest rates low on the most
popular form of savings accounts.
The German federal cartel office makes the charge in a letter to Mr Hilmar
Kopper, the bank's chief executive, sent after he remarked at a
shareholders' meeting that if the public sector savings banks raised their
interest rates, the bank would follow suit 'within 24 hours'.
The cartel authorities have asked Mr Kopper to explain, suggesting that his
reluctance to raise rates first is evidence of a lack of competition at the
less sophisticated end of the savings market. The inquiry relates to a
special type of account
with interest rates of 2.5-3 per cent - lower than inflation and half as
much as can be obtained on more sophisticated products. Despite the low
rates, these basic savings accounts are the most popular form of savings
vehicle in Germany and deposits are thought to total DM500bn (Pounds 170bn).
'We are basically concerned that interest rates on these accounts are too
low,' a cartel office spokesman said yesterday. 'If there really were
competition you would expect Deutsche Bank just to put interest rates up.'
Deutsche Bank said yesterday that the charges would be denied flatly. The
bank is likely to argue that competition exists already - as individual
regional branches are free to set different prices to compete according to
local conditions.
The bank will also argue that Mr Kopper's remark has been taken out of
context. The savings banks have denied fixing market rates and have accused
Mr Kopper of speaking in a way hostile to a market economy.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Nato chief hints at heavier intervention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE, Defence Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PEACEKEEPING FORCES in situations such as Yugoslavia may require heavier
military capabilities than those deployed up until now in United Nations
operations, General John Galvin, Nato's supreme commander in Europe, said
yesterday.
'You may find a peacekeeping force cannot be walking around with just blue
helmets and pistols,' he told an audience in a speech at the Royal United
Services Institute in London.
Experience so far in peacekeeping operations in Yugoslavia had shown that
such operations had to be carefully thought out, leaving room for
flexibility and reinforcement, he said.
He would not comment, however, on prospects for larger-scale military
intervention.
The UN peacekeeping business was 'booming', with 13 different operations
launched since 1988, more than in the previous history of the organisation.
However, these forces were usually deployed where there was an established
peace to keep. 'I'm not sure that's always going to be true,' he said.
Gen Galvin, who retires from his post later this month, expressed confidence
that Nato would take on peacekeeping missions, which is a subject due for
discussion by foreign ministers in Oslo this week.
However, it was unlikely to undertake such a role in eastern Europe without
the involvement of east European countries, he said.

European Commission's competition authorities that the Italian government is
committed to the restructuring plan prepared for Ilva, the state-owned steel
group.
Sir Leon Brittan, the competition commissioner, must now decide whether to
recommend approval of the state aid package, or whether it is likely to
distort competition, in which case he can call for it to be altered or
abandoned. Sir Leon is likely to submit his recommendation to the full
Commission next week.
A decision on the politically sensitive Ilva case was held up until after
the Italian election. Within the last few weeks Mr Andreotti has written a
letter to Sir Leon underlining the government's commitment to the package.
Commission officials said they were sure that the caretaker government's
promises would be honoured by the next coalition.
The Ilva plan outlined last summer would have involved an injection of up to
L1,200bn (Dollars 992m) in new capital from its parent, the IRI state
holding company. The group received L350bn when it absorbed Sofim, the state
agency entrusted with economic development in southern Italy. Ilva hopes IRI
will come up with a further L300bn, and has said it will also sell off
assets to concentrate on its core businesses.
Ilva is likely to reveal more details of its plans today when it will
announce results for 1991. The group is expected to report a loss of up to
L450bn.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Arts: National Opera Studio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Students of accountancy and law may count themselves fortunate that they do
not have to do end-of-term public showings. Each year the singers of the
National Opera Studio are expected to appear in an evening of scenes from
various operas, which is in some ways more difficult than performing in a
complete one.
For this year's 'Showcase', given at the Queen Elizabeth Hall on Saturday,
the Studio made sure that professional guidance was on hand. Tim Albery was
the producer and David Parry with the Bournemouth Sinfonietta took charge of
the musical side, but neither exactly gave the students an easy ride. The
ensemble was precarious even in the scores the orchestra seemed to know,
while events on stage sometimes saw ingenuity triumph over commonsense.
The test of an evening like this is to see if the student performers can
find the mechanism that makes their characters tick within the timescale of
a single scene. To this end Albery had not been a wholly reliable guide. The
amorous cavorting between Rossini's Figaro and Rosina had little to do with
their operatic characters; and Don Jose was left to sing the Flower Song
lying on his back while his glamorous Carmen did a striptease on the other
side of the stage.
Nevertheless, at least the Studio does have a Don Jose. Indeed, both the
tenors made a good impression vocally. Mark Luther, who had appeared in the
Carmen excerpt, also sang in a scene from Donizetti's Anna Bolena, though
arguably with a better feeling for the French sound and style. Mark Le Brocq
was wanting in sensuality as Massenet's Des Grieux, but returned as an
outstanding Albert Herring, genuinely moving, a complete operatic portrayal
in embryo.
The standard of singing suggested a good year. Among the strengths were Kay
Jordan's Anna Bolena and Anita Morrison's Agathe, in Weber's Der Freischutz.
The honours of the evening, however, went to the partnership of Mary Plazas
and Ann Taylor-Morley, who took on a scene from Donizetti's rarely-performed
Maria Padilla and delivered it with a fine sense of style. These were two
operatic people who came alive and one would gladly have stayed for them in
the rest of the opera.

FT  02 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Baring expects 'quantum drop'
in Swiss inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST Thursday's Ascension Day holiday seemed, yesterday, to have taken the
initiative away from most continental bourses, writes Our Markets Staff.
Baring Securities observed that last week's subdued performance from
European equity markets followed on from weakness in bond markets, the
latter reflecting weakness in US bonds and interest rate prospects, and
disappointment with French fiscal policy.
This week, its strategy team expects 'another quantum drop' in the headline
rate of Swiss inflation, perhaps giving some impetus to a bourse which has
been somnolent, if still elevated, in recent days.
STOCKHOLM rode a wavelet of foreign interest, with talk of institutional
program trading as the Affarsvarlden General index closed 7.0 higher at
998.5 in turnover up from from SKr349m to SKr642m. However, dealers noted
that the sharp jump in volume reflected the fact that many of big investors,
including all of the major insurance companies, stayed closed last Friday.
Among prominent winners the base metal miner, Trelleborg, recovered some of
last week's losses on disappointing current year prospects to end with the B
shares SKr7 higher at SKr130. The June synthetic future on the OMX Swedish
share index closed at 746.3, compared with a spot level of 740.18. Some
analysts said that equities may be poised to shoot through a resistance
level
Other Nordic makers were not so fortunate. COPENHAGEN's 25-share KFX index
fell 0.58 to 100.04 ahead of today's Maastrict treaty referendum, reflecting
profit-taking in heavyweight stocks like Novo Nordisk, FLS Industries and
Carlsberg.
OSLO lagged in spite of slightly firmer prices for Norway's North Sea oil.
The all-share index fell 1.56 to 449.53 in turnover of NKr173m. Meanwhile,
HELSINKI shed 1 per cent, the Hex index closing 8.5 lower at 892.2 in slow
trade. KOP restricted shares fell FM1 to FM11.50 following Friday's first
quarter loss of FM527m, up from a deficit of FM95m for the same period of
last year.
MILAN's screen trading system was knocked out of commission by heavy
rainstorms and lightning overnight; this produced drastic cuts in volume in
its 35 stocks which account for about one quarter of bourse turnover, and
the rise of 1.38 to 497.98 in the Comit index came in very thin trading.
Turnover was estimated at L60bn or less, against figures in the L100bn area
last week and over L150bn on Friday, May 22.
Sifa, the state-held controlled financial services company, closed L153 or
13 per cent higher at L1,350 after being delayed from trading once during
the session for excessive gains. Consob, the market's regulatory agency, had
suspended Sifa from trading on Friday pending details of a plan, approved
over the weekend, to merge it with the state engineering group, Finmeccanica
SpA.
FRANKFURT was subdued, the DAX index ending 5.08 lower at 1,798.14 after a
decline of 2.83 to 718.34 in the FAZ at midsession. Turnover stayed low by
recent standards at DM5.1bn, up from DM4.6bn last Friday.
Bulls had the upper hand in a pre-bourse which saw the DAX well above
Friday's level in a continuation of that day's gains, but they lost the
initiative after both follow-through orders and foreign buyers failed to
materialise.
PARIS saw out a dull day in which technical factors were more influential
than corporate news. A number of leading shares went ex dividend, which
helped to depress the index, and slim turnover of some FFr1.5bn showed that
there were few buyers around. The CAC-40 index closed down 15.89 at
2,017.40.
Euro Disney again featured among the day's losers, falling FFr4 to FFr117
following negative press comment over the weekend. Eurotunnel advanced 30
centimes to FFr36.55 after bankers agreed at the end of last week to make
new funds available.
Elsewhere, Paribas lost FFr3.40 to FFr408, LVMH roseFFr5 to FFr4,025 and Elf
shed FFr3.60 at FFr398.40.
AMSTERDAM was led lower by the weaker dollar which affected stocks with
exposure to the US. The CBS Tendency index closed down 0.6 at 130.4 in
turnover of Fl 504.6m.
Royal Dutch lost 60 cents to Fl 157.00, Unilever was Fl 2.20 down at Fl
183.10 and Akzo slipped 90 cents to Fl 159.30.
BRUSSELS improved on the first day of trade after a four day holiday. The
Bel-20 index finished up 1.76 to 1,232.56 in high turnover of BFr1.4bn.
Tractebel put on BFr300 or 3.6 per cent to BFr8,600 following local press
interviews with the chairman over the weekend while Glaverbel, the glass
manufacturer, gained BFr90 to BFr3,980 following a positive agm last week.
MADRID was weaker, with news that the current account deficit had narrowed
slightly between April and March having little effect on sentiment. The
general index closed down 0.41 at 260.65 with turnover estimated at Pta14bn.
Banesto weakened Pta5 to Pta2,895 after it said at its annual meeting at the
weekend that it was setting up a Pta6bn loan loss reserve to stabilise
profits and that it is to reduce industrial investments. BBV lost Pta25
following its purchase of a 20 per cent stake in General Electric Capital of
Puerto Rico for Pta2bn. Acerinox rose Pta610 to Pta7,600.
VIENNA was stronger with sentiment boosted by the successful offer of 5.4m
shares in Vienna International Airport. The issue, which was due to last all
week, was closed yesterday with trading planned to begin next month. The
offer, reducing the state's share to 73 per cent, will raise Sch1.8bn to
finance expansion work. The ATX index gained 3.06 to 990.2.

FT  02 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Growing optimism lifts Dow
Jones to record high
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Wall Street
US STOCK MARKETS turned early weakness on higher bond yields into a
record-breaking performance yesterday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average
finished above 3,400 for the first time in its history, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow was up 16.33 at 3,413.21, a near 40-point recovery from
its low of the early morning. Among other indices, the more broadly based
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 1.93 to 417.25, the Amex composite rose 0.15 to
394.84 and the Nasdaq composite ended 3.21 higher at 588.37. Turnover on the
NYSE was 181m shares.
The dominant factor of the morning was bond prices, which fell almost a full
point at the long end (pushing the yield back up to nearly 8 per cent in the
process) as Treasury investors interpreted a strong May purchasing managers'
report as reducing the chances of another interest rate cut by the Federal
Reserve.
The selling in the equity markets, however, could not be sustained, and amid
growing enthusiasm about the outlook for the economy, share prices advanced
across all fronts late in the session.
The car sector led the way higher, with all three of the big car markers
rising as investors continued to anticipate a recovery in their fortunes.
General Motors rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 41 5/8 in turnover of 3.3m
shares, Ford added Dollars 1 7/8 at Dollars 46 3/8 in 2m shares, and
Chrysler advanced Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 19 3/4 as 1.9m shares changed
hands.
Chrysler received an additional boost from Salomon Brothers, the Wall Street
broking house, which raised its earnings outlook for the group and predicted
profits in both the second quarter and the full year 1992. Salomon set a new
price target for Chrysler stock of Dollars 25 over the next 12 months.
After the opening of trading was delayed because of an imbalance of orders
on the sell side, Commonwealth Edison fell Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 31 1/2
in the wake of a warning from the broking house, Kidder Peabody, that the
company's current divided rate might be cut.
Citicorp climbed Dollars  3/4 to Dollars 19 3/8 after Morgan Stanley
upgraded the stock from a 'hold' to a 'buy', citing dramatic strides in
cost-cutting, peaking problem real-estate assets in North America and an
expected boost to earnings from strong franchises in emerging markets.
Waste Management rose Dollars 2 3/8 to Dollars 38 in heavy trading on the
news that the Supreme Court had ruled in favour of the group's subsidiary
Chemical Waste Management, which had challenged a special fee levied by
Alabama on out-of-state hazardous waste.
Canada
TORONTO Stock prices closed higher in moderate trading. According to
preliminary data, the TSE 300 rose 16.05, or 0.47 per cent, to close at
3,403.98. Advancing issues edged declines 276 to 259.
Volume of 22.8m shares was up from Friday's 20.3m, and trading value rose to
CDollars 303.3m from CDollars 223.8m.
Eight of 14 stock groups closed higher, led by the transportation group, up
2.2 per cent.
Laidlaw B, the most-heavily weighted stock in the group, rose  3/8 to 12 1/4
. Financial services gained 1.5 per cent and gold was up 1.0 per cent.
Industrial products also closed higher.
Magna International A tumbled 1 1/8 to 32 5/8 . The company said it plans to
issue 3.2m class A shares at CDollars 32.25 a share.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar rises on US indicators
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR staged a recovery in late European trading on the foreign
exchange markets yesterday following signs of strong US manufacturing growth
last month, writes James Blitz.
Potential dollar buyers grew confident after the National Association of
Purchasing Management's index rose at its fastest pace in almost four years
to stand at 56.3 in May from 51.3 the month before. The survey's employment
index also jumped to 49.1 from 43.9 in April, its highest level since April
1989. The dollar closed at DM1.6100 in London, after a previous close of
DM1.6070.
However, there was still uncertainty in a number of traders' minds about the
scope and pace of the US economic recovery. The April figures for personal
income and consumption released yesterday were both weaker than expected.
These showed a 0.1 per cent rise in personal income in April, and a 0.3 per
cent rise in consumption.
According to Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi International in
London, yesterday's indicators may effectively add up to an ill omen. 'The
real danger is the mismatch in output gains and personal consumption,' he
says. 'If the increase in manufacturing output is not matched by personal
consumption there will be a build-up of stocks that will lead to a cut in
production in the third quarter.' Other economists believe that the market
needs more time to decide whether to invest in dollars. 'The market will
look at money supply figures on Thursday and the non-farm payroll on
Friday,' said Mr Nick Stamenkovic, an economist at DKB International in
London. 'Until we get signs of a stronger recovery the dollar will remain in
narrow ranges.'
Yesterday's good figures for business confidence in the US failed to
restrain the dollar's losses against the Japanese yen after the Bank of
Japan intervened to strengthen its currency for the fourth day running.
Analysts reckon that the BoJ has spent Dollars 500m in intervention
operations in the last four days, as it tries to reduce its huge trade
surplus in the run up to the summit of the Group of Seven leading industrial
nations in July. In late Asian trading, the BoJ pushed the dollar below
Y127, its lowest level for four months. By the end of the European trading
session, the dollar stood at Y127.40, after a previous close of Y127.70.
The Danish krone was well underpinned as the latest polls showed that Danes
will vote 'yes' in today's referendum on European economic and monetary
union. The krone remained at the foot of the European Monetary System's
grid, but at minus 34 per cent of allowed swing below its central Ecu rate,
after Friday's close of minus 37 per cent.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Short rates softer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-TERM rates in the sterling cash markets ended slightly softer
yesterday after the Bank of England took what appeared to be an
accommodating position in its money market operations.
Most of the period rates remained unchanged, with everything from 4-month to
9-month Libor once again ending at 10 per cent, and 1-year Libor at 9 15/16
per cent. But 3-month Libor, a key indicator of where interest rates are
moving, ended at 10 1/32 per cent, down  1/16 per cent on Friday's close.
Short term clearing bank certificates of deposit were also slightly softer,
with 1-month CDs ending at 9 29/32 per cent from a previous close of 10 1/32
per cent, and 3-month CDs ending at 9 7/8 per cent from 9 31/32 per cent.
The softening of rates was partly due to the small size of the shortage
forecast by the Bank of England. At Pounds 750m, this was far smaller than
those of last week, which amounted to Pounds 7.6bn over four days. Dealers
said that the Bank of England had also taken an accommodating stance,
inviting offers of bills in the early round.
However, the market was extremely slow to remove the shortage, with several
dealers putting the blame on a shortage of bills.
As one dealer put it, the market is currently being squeezed between two
phenomena. On the one hand, there is the usual slowing down of the economy
over the summer, which means that few bills are being offered to the Bank of
England. But there are also large shortages to be taken out, mostly due to
the large number of gilt issues being offered by the Bank.
As a result, the Bank purchased only Pounds 86m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9
7/8 per cent in its early operations yesterday. The forecast was later
revised to a shortage of around Pounds 900m before taking account of the
early operations.
The Bank then purchased Pounds 75m of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, and Pounds 10m for resale to the market on 22 June at an interest rate
of 9 15/16 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 20m of Band-1 bank bills at 9
7/8 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 345m.
The cost of overnight funding jumped to 11-10 1/2 per cent at one stage and
closed at 9 3/4 per cent.

London's robusta COFFEE market saw early gains erased in the afternoon,
leaving the September contract unchanged from Friday's close. Dealers said
there was little follow-through buying interest after Friday's advance in
New York. The market could now settle down to trade in a narrow band ahead
of the first set of negotiations for a new coffee pact on June 22-26.
Dealers discounted some unconfirmed talk of cold weather in Brazil. LME
trading was mainly influenced by fluctuations in the sterling/dollar
exchange rate, with most metals ending below their highs. Three-month TIN
touched a 20-month high of Dollars 6,460 a tonne after European trade buying
touched off short covering and buy stops. While profit taking eventually
pared gains, chartists are still looking for a near-term target of Dollars
6,500. Nymex PLATINUM futures were firmer at midday as the fundamental front
continued to look bright. Analysts cited continued concerns over the
availability of physical supply, particularly in Europe, as well as
perceptions that European car companies are coming to market. The EC set the
end of this year as the deadline for new models of gasoline-powered cars to
have catalytic converters.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Fresh 'mad cow' study urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Clark, the UK shadow agriculture minister, is to call for an
independent report into 'mad cow' disease, saying that the incidence of
infection is continuing to rise.
According to Mr Clark, there has been a weekly average of 631 new cases in
Britain in the four months to end-April 1992, compared with 437 last year.
This constitutes an increase of 45 per cent.
He plans today to table a parliamentary written question asking Mr John
Gummer, the agriculture minister, to convene a committee of independent
scientific experts to publish a report on the disease.
'In the pre-election period, the government was trying to con us that the
disease would start declining soon,' he said.
According to Mr Clark's figures, a total of 55,300 cases of bovine
spongiform encephalopathy (as the disease is more properly termed) has now
been diagnosed, with the heaviest concentration in south-west England.
The ministry of agriculture yesterday did not dispute that the incidence of
infection was continuing to rise but said the number of new cases was
expected to peak very shortly.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: CIS metal output lower than
estimated, says report
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LEAD and zinc production in the states comprising the former Soviet Union
has been nowhere near the level most western estimates suggest, claims the
Commodities Research Unit, the London-based consultancy.
It says lead mine output has been less than half the 490,000 tonnes widely
estimated by western analysts. Zinc mine production has been less than
two-thirds the previously estimated 870,000 tonnes.
The CRU bases its estimates on fieldwork and personal contacts within the
former Soviet Union. Metal production figures are still state secrets and
are not published by official sources in Moscow.
The consultancy's estimates suggest that the former Soviet Union was the
third largest producer of mined copper in 1990, after Chile and the US, with
an output of almost exactly 1m tonnes - not far short of figures given by
other western analysts.
'In spite of a policy of self-sufficiency under the former communist regime,
the Soviet Union was not self-sufficient in mine production of copper, lead
or zinc,' says the CRU in a special report produced in association with
Mekhanobr Institute, a technical research organisation based in St
Petersburg.
'More than 100,000 tonnes of copper in concentrates were imported from
Mongolia in 1988-90; imports of lead concentrates were recently as high as
12 per cent of smelter production, although they fell in 1991 because of the
shortage of foreign exchange; imports of zinc concentrates were more than 8
per cent of smelter production in 1990, but have also fallen since then.'
The CRU blames lack of investment in mine development and declining ore
grades for the weak state of the Soviet industry. It suggests that pollution
is of serious concern at all the Soviet copper, lead and zinc smelters and
is now starting to restrict production.
It suggests, however, that Russia and Kazakhstan, the republics dominating
base metal production in the Commonwealth of Independent States, 'could
become very attractive areas for investment by western mining companies.'
The Copper, Lead and Zinc Industries of the former USSR, Pounds 12,000 from
the CRU, 31 Mount Pleasant, London WC1X 0AD.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ekofisk oilfield back to full
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S EKOFISK oilfield was back in full production yesterday, less than a
week after being shut down following a fire in an air filter on one of its
platforms.
Phillips Petroleum, the field's operator, said Ekofisk was producing at
slightly above its usual output of 250,000 barrels a day, because of a small
build-up of pressure while the field was closed. The nearby Valhall and Hod
fields, linked to Ekofisk by pipeline, were pumping a combined 114,000 b/d,
up from their normal 100,000.
Gas supplies from Ekofisk to a consortium of European buyers via Emden in
Germany had also resumed.
NPD, Norway's oil industry watchdog, ordered the closure of the field on
Monday of last week pending clarification of the cause of a brief fire in
the air filter of a gas turbine.
Phillips said yesterday that the incident was the result of human error,
which led to a small explosion in the turbine following routine cleaning.
The company is changing the alarm system on its turbines as a result.
The fire occurred only hours before a planned maintenance shutdown that
would have closed the field for about 90 hours. Had the Ekofisk closure
lasted for an extended period, there were fears that this might have
affected production from the giant Statfjord and Gullfaks fields, with
combined output of more than 1m b/d.
The Ula and Gyda fields, which are also tied into Ekofisk, were not yet
producing because of maintenance work, Phillips said, but were expected to
be back on-stream soon.

DEPRESSED SILVER prices have prompted Asarco, the big US mining group, to
close temporarily its Galena silver mine in Northern Idaho. The mine, which
produced 3.3m troy ounces of silver last year, will be placed on a
care-and-maintenance footing.
Silver prices are at their lowest in real terms since the late 1960s and
there is little expectation in the market that they will turn around soon.
Asarco holds a 37.5 per cent interest in Galena's profits and Hecla Mining
Company has a 12.5 per cent interest.
Coeur d'Alene Mines Corporation, the mine's owner and from which it is
leased, takes 50 per cent.
Lower metals prices shaved Dollars 100m off Asarco's last year's earnings of
Dollars 46m and they have continued to bite into this year's. The company,
which has spent heavily to expand, is keen to improve operating results.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Mr Koskov's copper-bottomed
business plan - One of Russia's small but growing band of entrepreneurs
talks to Kenneth Gooding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VLADIMIR KOSKOV is offering holidays in Spain and Lada cars to encourage
people to collect the copper scrap that he says is liberally scattered
across Russia. Collectors are rarely interested in roubles, he says. So
student collectors can earn eight days in Spain for every half a tonne of
old copper they deliver. He has also bought 100 Ladas, each to be swapped
for four and a half tonnes of scrap.
Mr Koskov is one of a small but growing band of Russian entrepreneurs
battling a system that is proving resistant to change. Copper is central to
his plans for the future. He sees the metal as a certain way of converting
roubles into hard currency. But there is the little matter of obtaining
export licences.
He is certain his company will eventually get the licences it needs.
However, the situation is complex because the old bureaucracy knows there is
money to be made from the bribes for favours done when something is in
demand. 'The old system bred a criminal mentality,' Mr Koskov suggests. So
licences are for absurdly small amounts of copper, from 1,000 to 5,000
tonnes. The more licences to be issued, the greater the bribe opportunity.
Some will be issued by the Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and some
by the regional authority in Ekaterinburg. The rest will be auctioned off to
the highest bidder at commodity exchanges.
Mr Koskov is a mild-mannered man of 40. He was head of automation at a
defence equipment manufacturing establishment before starting his own
business in 1988. This was a small consultancy co-operative involving seven
other people from the local polytechnic and the defence plant.
He had his first taste of the opportunities offered by exporting when he
swapped 100 Russian guitars for two computers. The guitars were to be sold
to students at Cambridge in England and Mr Koskov simply gave them to
someone who was about to take off from Moscow airport to London. 'There were
some problems with customs officers at Moscow,' he recalls with a smile.
'But I said, where is it written that an aircraft passenger can't take 100
guitars?'
Today his Teknesis group of companies, based in Ekaterinburg, has a wide
range of interests but the most important one at the moment is collecting
Russia's copper scrap and having it re-refined into metal suitable for
export.
He says that last year Teknesis exported about 10,000 tonnes of copper (as
well as 10,000 tonnes of aluminium, some tungsten and molybdenum). This year
he hopes to get licences to export 75,000 tonnes of copper from Russia.
Teknesis also has a deal with the Balkhash and Upper Pyshminsky refineries
in Kazakstan to sell all their production, perhaps 150,000 tonnes.
To put this into context, the former Soviet Union's net copper exports moved
above 100,000 tonnes for the first time only in 1989. Last year, as the new
Commonwealth of Independent States exported everything possible to raise
desperately-needed hard currency, net exports are estimated to have reached
312,000 tonnes.
Mr Koskov is storing copper in a warehouse at Le Havre, France, where it can
be used as collateral for loans from the Credit Lyonaise bank as well as
providing a buffer stock to ensure a smooth supply to customers. He says a
quality guarantee is given by the Societe General Surveillance of Geneva. He
has set up companies in France, England and Switzerland to handle his export
business, which he claims now has an annual turnover of about Dollars 100m.
Metal sales are organised by his London office. He describes the copper
operation as 'an enabler'. It is simply a way of raising the hard currency
he needs to push through ambitious plans for his business in Russia. He is
using the hard currency raised to import computers and other equipment into
Russia. His aim is to link the main business centres there through one or
two computer head stations eventually using about 30,000 terminals. He also
hopes Russia's newly-developing commodity exchanges will be linked via this
system and suggests that this link should help to stabilise the prices of
some goods.
There tend to be gluts of goods in some parts of the republic, particularly
at the ports, and severe shortages in others. Mr Koskov believes an
integrated commodity exchange system would reflect the overall situation
more accurately.
Teknesis is also setting up business centres in, initially, five cities
(Ekaterinburg, Moscow, St Petersburg, Khabarovsk and Novosibirsk) aimed
particularly at western companies that would prefer to move in when all the
equipment - telephones, computers, furniture and so on - is installed and up
and running - Mr Koskov is even offering Renault limousines as part of a
package for companies needing to ferry people to and from airports.
In spite of Russia's economic problems, he hopes to sell about 1,000 of
these business centres at 9m roubles each, or Dollars 65,000 or 70 tonnes of
copper. He says that, once the price is paid, he can guarantee an office
will be ready for occupation in 45 days.
Mr Koskov also is building up his copper business in Russia. His company is
supplying the Kazakhstan smelters - from a plant in Omsk - with a flotation
agent, needed in the refining process. The new agent, he claims, reduces
emissions of sulphur dioxide (one of the causes of acid rain) by 10 to 20
per cent.
He recently started to supply the flotation agent and scrap copper to the
huge Norilsk nickel-copper combine. Norilsk needs scrap for its smelting
process and in return Koskov is willing to buy refined copper for 300,000
roubles a tonne instead of the 70,000 roubles the Russian state export
agency would pay.
He is also selling copper to a pipe producer at Revda, near Ekaterinburg,
which in turn is exporting his products to France.
Mr Koskov says he set up his Swiss company to manage the group's finances
because the Russian banking system has virtually collapsed. According to his
statement of account, the Bank for Foreign and Economic Affairs owes his
companies Dollars 500,000 in hard currency. 'But the bank has no money. The
state took the money.'
He complains that, until recently, any person with hard currency and
apparently well-off was assumed by most Russians to be a criminal, part of
Russia's Mafia. That is now changing, he suggests. 'People are now beginning
to realise there are good as well as bad ways of making money.'
But the entrepreneurial spirit is still hard to detect in Russia. Mr Koskov
says he knows of only a handful of other Russian entrepreneurs and tells an
anecdote to illustrate his point.
A year ago he approached the management at the defence plant where he once
worked offering to help. They were not interested. But recently they called
him back. 'The plant was at a standstill. The managers were just sitting
there, twiddling their thumbs, waiting for something to happen.' He asked
them if the plant could produce car bodies if it was given a contract. Yes,
said the managers, but there was no capital and, even worse, they had to
dispose of 6,000 surplus missiles.
Mr Koskov had to point out that there were tons of valuable alloys, ounces
of precious metal and hundreds of expensive components to be reclaimed from
this missile stockpile.
Many other people in Mr Koskov's position would have taken the profit and
retired, perhaps to a sunnier climate. Why does he press on, combatting a
system and enduring the chaos?
He does not pause an instant before replying: 'It is sad for any man to see
his mother dying - Russia is dying and it is very painful for me'.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Mexico embraces the
international financial markets - The share offerings and foreign listing
which have made an impact on the country's business methods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE past 12 months around a dozen Mexican companies have become
significant players in the international financial markets, issuing billions
of dollars in new stock and, in some cases, acquiring listings on Wall
Street.
Just a few years ago such events in Mexico would have been thought of as
laughable. Not surprisingly the speed and extent of the changes are having a
profound effect on Mexican business methods.
The share offerings have been spurred by the large financing needs of
industry which needs badly to catch up after a decade of weak capital
investment if it is to make the most of the proposed free trade pact with
North America.
The trend started in May 1991 when the Mexican government sold 14 per cent
of Telmex, Mexico's telephone monopoly, for Dollars 2.17bn, most of it in
American or Global Depository Receipts.
In all, Mexican companies placed about Dollars 4.8bn of stock at home and
abroad last year. This year Dollars 3.6bn has already been raised and a
further Dollars 2bn could be in issue before the year is out.
Companies as diverse as Telmex, Vitro, Mexico's largest industrial
conglomerate, and ICA, the construction company, are now listed on the New
York Stock Exchange, with more to follow.
Foreign investment in Mexican ADRs is now short of Dollars 20bn.
In part, the rush to sell stock abroad reflects the phenomenal rise of the
Mexican stock market and the desire of existing owners to cash on the high
earnings multiples being offered: and the issues have had to be
international since the Mexican stock market is far too small to absorb all
the paper on sale. The more so since more than Dollars 11bn of Mexican
savings have been used up to buy the country's privatised banks from the
government.
Most Mexican companies were starved of capital during the 1980s. They are
now having to invest heavily in a re-shape in order to compete under
Mexico's relatively open trade policy, and prepare for a North American free
trade area.
With foreign banks reluctant to lend directly, Mexican business has been
forced to tap foreign money through equity or bonds.
At the same time the large public offerings of Mexican stock are forcing
Mexican companies to face the discipline of the domestic and international
equity markets, and meet much tighter reporting requirements.
This marks a particularly profound change in management styles. In the past,
even some publicly owned Mexican companies were treated as little more than
personal fiefdoms, an approach which helped put many of the country's
largest companies into virtual bankruptcy in the early 1980s.
Mexican companies, prodded by the finance ministry, can see the benefits of
giving up their freedom to run companies as they wish: going public, or
being listed on foreign markets, cannot just reduce the cost of capital, but
attract foreign partners that might otherwise shun a third world company.
Mr Arturo Trevino, the director general of Gigante, the supermarket chain,
suggests that had it not been for his company's public listing, its joint
venture with the US's largest wholesaler Fleming could not have gone ahead.
Similarly, Mr Hugo Jaime Garcia, who is head of banking relations at Vitro,
says that his company's presence in global capital markets, while perhaps
demanding in terms of investor relations, 'reduces the aspect of Mexican
risk'.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Strong purchasing data trigger selling of
Treasuries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MUCH stronger-than -expected National Association of Purchasing
Management's report triggered heavy selling of US Treasury securities
yesterday, although late in the day prices recovered from their lows.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  21/32 at
101 7/32 , yielding 7.887 per cent. The short end of the market was also
markedly weaker, with the two-year note off  5/32 at 99 23/32 , yielding
5.259 per cent.
The rise in the NAPM's index for May from 51.3 the previous month to 56 was
bigger than analysts' forecasts (which had centred around 54), and sparked
an immediate sell-off as hopes for another interest rate cut from the
Federal Reserve dwindled further.
The purchasing managers figures indicated the economic recovery may be
advancing at a faster pace than bond investors initially realised. The data
suggested that Friday's employment report for May could show an improvement
in labour market conditions.
UK government bonds ended the day lower, taking their cue from the US
Treasury bond market.
The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from its opening level
of 118 9/32 to trade at 117 31/32 by late afternoon, yielding 9.07 per cent.
Short-dated gilts slipped by around  1/32 of a point, dealers said. The
Liffe gilt futures contract fell from its opening of 100.02 to end the day
at 99.23, but volumes in the futures market were lower than normal with
about 15,000 contracts traded.
The latest tap stock - the 9 per cent Conversion stock due 2000 - continues
to overhang the market, and dealers estimate that only about Pounds 200m of
the total Pounds 800m has been sold since it was issued on May 22.
The market will be watching today's final money supply figures for April
which are expected to provide details of exactly how much stock the Bank of
England sold after the April 9 general election. According to earlier
estimates, the Bank sold about Pounds 4bn of gilts immediately after the
election.
THE main European government bond markets slipped yesterday, following the
US Treasury bond market's lead and in the absence of significant economic
news on the domestic front.
German government bond futures drifted from their opening level of 87.87 to
end at 87.70, having traded in a narrow range of 87.69-87.89.
The Danish government bond market saw some profit-taking ahead of today's
referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on European Monetary Union.
In view of the most recent batch of opinion polls, traders expect Denmark to
ratify the Treaty, and the Danish bond market has already started to
discount a vote in favour.
Some traders reported switching out of Denmark into Belgium, a market which
has under-performed in recent days.
The yield spread of the Danish bond due 2000 over the 9 per cent Belgian
bond due 2001 narrowed from 16 basis points to 10 basis points yesterday.
A stronger yen against the US dollar helped to boost Japanese government
bonds yesterday, but the fall in share prices and the halt in the yen's rise
prompted profit-taking, and the bond market closed lower on the day.
The Bank of Japan intervened in the foreign exchange markets selling dollars
to boost the Japanese currency. The yen opened at Y127.15 in Tokyo trading
yesterday, against Y128.15 at Friday's Tokyo close, and strengthened to
Y126.6 in the afternoon at the peak of the central bank's intervention.
Traders noted some profit-taking as the yen slipped to reach Y127.15 against
the dollar at the end of the day. The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened
at 5.475 per cent, ending in Tokyo trading at 5.50 per cent. The yield moved
to 5.515 per cent in London following the initial weakness in the US
Treasury bond market and the yen's failure to continue its strengthening
against the dollar.
Dealers noted the No 144, which matures in 2001 and has a 6 per cent coupon,
may soon take over as the new benchmark bond as the three separate No 144
issues are combining to form a single large issue.

CBS, the US television network that is controlled by the Tisch family,
announced yesterday that starting next year it would levy new charges on it
214 affiliated stations.
The announcement, which CBS justified in the light of adverse competitive
and economic conditions faced by both networks and affiliates, is an
unprecedented move that may trigger protests.
CBS said the new charges would be based on programming and market sizes. The
network estimated it would generate Dollars 20m to Dollars 25m of new net
revenues.
Wall Street reacted favourably to the new charges, marking CBS stock Dollars
12 5/8 up to Dollars 204 5/8.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P cuts debt rating on four
US airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; Poor's, the US credit rating agency, yesterday downgraded debt
securities at four of the largest US airlines - a decision which, it said,
reflected the weak economic recovery and the domestic fares wars.
S&amp;P had placed the ratings of the seven leading non-bankrupt US carriers on
credit watch, with a view to a possible downgrading, in late-April.
The airlines affected by the downgradings are American, Delta, Northwest and
USAir. S&amp;P said it was still talking to management at United Airlines, and
that ratings of UAL, United's parent company, remained on credit watch 'with
negative implications'.
Of the four downgraded carriers, S&amp;P said that it believed only one -
American - had 'a chance to earn a profit in 1992'. It added that all should
report 'greatly improved earnings over the next several year,' but suggested
that 'the improvement in credit measures will be restrained by a heavy fixed
charge burden'.
At present, S&amp;P said, the rating outlooks on all four carriers remained
negative - suggesting that ratings could fall again if 'economic weakness
and/or fare competition prevents a return to levels of profitability'.
American attempted to overhaul the domestic fare structure earlier this
spring, but its initiative has since been hit by undercutting. Commenting,
S&amp;P said that 'the new fare structure initiated by American in April has
improved the mix of tickets sold but stimulation of business traffic and
shifts in market share have been modest.
'While airline managements disagree about the profit impact of the new
structure, most believe it will cause a net loss of revenue. More recent
leisure fare cuts will further dilute revenues in the coming months, despite
a flood of bookings,' S&amp;P said.
In the downgradings, the senior debt at AMR, American's parent, and American
Airlines itself was cut from BBB+ to BBB, for example; senior debt at Delta
fared similarly; at Northwest, it was cut from B+ to B; and at USAir the
senior secured debt was reduced from BB to BB-, and the unsecured senior
debt from BB to B+.
TWA, the bankrupt US carrier owned by Mr Carl Icahn, is laying off 300
employees at its maintenance base in Kansas City.
The airline, which made operating losses of over Dollars 100m in the first
three months of 1992, employs 4,000 workers at the base.
TWA said the 'furloughs' - temporary layoffs which can be reversed -
reflected a reduction in contract work from other carriers.

MCA, the Hollywood studio and entertainment group owned by Matsushita of
Japan, said its recreation services division planned to invest an additional
Dollars 200m in its two Universal Studios theme parks in 1992-93.
The investments in Universal Studios of Hollywood and Universal Studios of
Florida will match the capital spending planned for attractions in the
1991-92 season. The Florida theme park is a joint venture between MCA and
the Rank Organisation.
Increased revenues from feature films helped Carolco Pictures, the troubled
independent US film studio, improve its position for the quarter ended March
31, AP-DJ reports.
Net losses for the period were cut to Dollars 4.3m, or 27 cents a share,
compared with a deficit of Dollars 6.3m, or 20 cents a share, for the
year-ago period.
The result was struck on revenues of Dollars 136.5m, little changed from the
Dollars 136.6m last time.
Carolco said improved revenues from feature films helped offset a fall at
its 53 per cent-owned video subsidiary, LIVE Entertainment. Carolco said
feature film revenues rose Dollars 18.6m compared with the year-ago quarter.
It said 'in light of the current situation at LIVE and our continuing
efforts to effect a positive restructuring', it expected soon to retain an
investment banking firm to assist its recapitalisation.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Taxing times for multinationals
in Argentina - In 1983, companies such as Shell, Firestone and BAT
Industries entered the South American's government-sanctioned secondary
market in tax credits. But within five years, their experience became a tale
of fraud, corruption and taxation  - Argentine style
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TEN years ago, a group of multinational companies operating in Argentina
embarked on a what then seemed a legitimate, if complicated, tax-reduction
scheme. But far from saving the companies a few million dollars a year, they
say the scheme became a nightmare of fraud, corruption and arbitrary
government that cost them about Dollars 100m.
An embittered executive now warns companies to 'think five times' before
investing in Argentina. He says: 'You must be very wary and mistrustful.
Everything carries risk.'
That jars with Argentina's new free market image as a country where the
rules of the business game are fair and predictable.
The story begins in 1983, when companies such as Shell, Pirelli, BAT
Industries, Perkins Engines, Texas Instruments and Firestone entered a
government-sanctioned secondary market in tax credits.
This involved Argentine companies that were entitled to government tax
rebates on one side and companies that owed the government taxes on the
other.
The Argentine companies won rebates on their investments in development
zones in deprived regions and on sales that originated in those regions.
Rather than wait for payment from the DGI, the bureaucratic and inefficient
tax department, they would 'sell' their tax credits at a discount. The
'buyer' - invariably a multinational - could then reduce its tax bill by
'paying' part of its tax bill with tax credits to the DGI at their full face
value.
One of the biggest players in the tax credit market was Koner-Salgado, an
Argentine conglomerate. It sold over Dollars 100m-worth of credits over a
six-year period.
But, in 1988, the DGI suddenly declared Koner-Salgado's credits worthless
after investigators said the company faked investments to generate tax
credits.
The DGI then ordered Koner-Salgado's clients to pay back all the taxes they
had 'paid' with its allegedly fraudulent credits.
But the multinationals point to the fact that the DGI investigation took
place in 1985, three years earlier. They say DGI officials suppressed the
report, failed to warn buyers of Koner-Salgado credits, and continued
accepting the credits until the report was leaked in 1988.
At first the companies refused to pay up, arguing they were being made to
pay for a crime committed by others. They alleged that the DGI had acted in
bad faith.
The case reached the Supreme Court over a year ago. But it said that before
it could rule on the case, the plaintiffs first had to comply with the DGI's
tax demand of hundreds of millions of dollars. They could then try to
recover the money by suing the DGI.
A tax lawyer explained that the DGI's apparently arbitrary claim was based
on legislation under which it could paradoxically rule a company was evading
taxes even if it acted legally. This is because transactions are not
assessed for tax on their legal 'appearance' but on their underlying 'real'
purpose.
The lawyer says: 'The government is never wrong. It is like Big Brother.
Argentina is a perverse country where something may be permitted one day and
the next day it has become a crime.'
Naturally, the government's view is rather different. The present head of
the DGI is Mr Carlos Tacchi, a tax lawyer before entering government last
year. He holds up the Koner-Salgado affair as an example of his offensive
against tax evasion, in which he does not discriminate between evaders, be
they large or small.
Although Mr Tacchi refused to be interviewed for this article, he has
claimed companies knew the credits were false all along. He says that, like
all other tax specialists - including the multinationals' advisers - he was
offered commissions to push the deep-discounted credits.
Mr Tacchi, who is as honest as he is ferociously efficient at collecting
taxes, implies that at best, companies were robbed by corrupt employees and
advisers. At worst, they actively dodged taxes.
Rather than begin long, expensive litigation in a judicial system not known
for its independence or impartiality, the companies decided to negotiate.
In the end, all but two accepted a compromise, their liability was reduced,
and they were given five years to pay.
But Firestone and BAT Industries' affiliate Nobleza-Piccardo decided to
fight. Their resistance is understandable: Firestone was originally asked
for Dollars 180m and Nobleza Dollars 130m.
Lobbying by the companies and the UK and US embassies achieved little. Last
October, a court froze Firestone's assets as a first step to its
liquidation. Firestone swiftly capitulated, followed by Nobleza.
Mr Tacchi offered them the same deal as the other multinationals. Nobleza,
which had bought Dollars 31m-worth of credits, was charged an extra Dollars
6.6m. It has begun paying the full Dollars 37.6m in 60 monthly instalments,
with the first nine due all at once. That is a heavy blow for a company with
an operating loss of Dollars 11.2m in the first nine months of 1991.
None of the companies considers payment as a recognition of guilt. Some are
demanding arbitration by an independent tribunal. But even if they do win,
the virtually bankrupt government will pay not with cash but with 16-year
bonds. Already, a secondary bond market is beginning to emerge.
Suspects at the DGI and Koner Salgado have yet to go on trial. But the
wheels of Argentina's justice have always ground slowly for the accused.
Massive financial fraud that cost the central bank Dollars 15.8bn during the
1980s has gone unpunished because so few of the suspects were ever brought
to trial.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Citibank Canada chief to leave

   TORONTO, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RICK COPELAND, president of Citicorp's Canadian subsidiary, is taking
early retirement, apparently as a result of the bank's large exposure to
Olympia &amp; York, the troubled Toronto-based developer.
Late yesterday, a Citibank spokesman confirmed that Mr Copeland was leaving
'to pursue other interests'. The bank said he would stay until a successor
was named. Sources within the bank said staff had been given the news
earlier by Mr Copeland's New York-based superior, Mr Alan McDonald.
Citibank Canada has an exposure to O&amp;Y, both in its own capacity and as an
agent, totalling about CDollars 800m (USDollars 666.6m). Citicorp's
operations in other countries have also been heavy lenders to troubled real
estate developers, including the UK property group, Mountleigh, which
collapsed last week.
Citibank Canada is the second largest foreign-owned bank in Canada, with
assets of CDollars 5.5bn on January 31.
However, even before the O&amp;Y problems, its performance had been lacklustre.
The bank earned CDollars 5.1m in the first quarter, giving a return on
equity of only 4.2 per cent. The full extent of losses from O&amp;Y is likely to
be more apparent in results for the second quarter, which ended on April 30.
Citicorp said in a recent submission to the US Securities and Exchange
Commission that it had written off USDollars 101m of loans to O&amp;Y, and
classified the remaining USDollars 279m as non-performing.
Mr Copeland, 50, has worked for Citicorp since he graduated from university
in 1967.
Salomon Brothers said it was moving its head of non-Japanese Asia-Pacific
business, Mr Gavin Farley, to Europe to head up its corporate finance
efforts in the UK and France, AP-DJ reports from London.
Mr Farley, a Briton, will take up the new post in August after four years as
head of the Asia-Pacific unit. Replacing him in Asia will be Mr Thomas
Jasper, who has been head of Asian accounts in the US.
Mr Farley has been with Salomon Brothers for nine years. He was formerly
with Morgan Stanley and Citibank.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Warner fails to commit to Sony
Mini Disc
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WARNER Music Group, a division of US entertainment giant Time Warner, has
declined to commit its roster of artists to the new Mini Disc audio
technology format being developed by Sony of Japan.
Mini Disc is a portable recording and playback system which Sony is due to
launch in Japan in November and which it hopes will eventually become the
main successor to the analog cassette tape.
In a statement, Warner said it was still addressing the relative merits of
Mini Disc and its main rival, the digital compact cassette being developed
by Dutch group Philips.
Sony was putting on a brave face yesterday. A spokesman in New York said:
'We are happy that Warner is reviewing the two technologies equally.'
Warner is reluctant to commit itself to the new digital technology because
of concern that new formats may crimp the growth of compact discs (CDs)and
to a lesser extent, cassette tapes.
Mr Robert Morgado, in his role as chairman of Warner Music Group, said:
'Compact Disc is the premier carrier for the music industry and we are
asking manufacturers to assure us that their new technologies do not
adversely impact CDs continued growth.'
The decision by Warner not to back the Mini Disc is a blow to Sony's hopes
for the product. In order for Mini Disc to succeed, Sony must offer a wide
range of music titles to potential buyers of Mini Disc players when the
product enters the market later this year. Yet so far only two big labels,
EMI Music and Sony's own music division, have signed up with Mini Disc.
Sony had hoped Warner with its powerful roster of stars including Madonna
and Rod Stewart, would prove an important recruit.
To date, Philip's digital compact cassette format appears to have a head
start on Sony's Mini Disc. It has already won artist commitments from the
six biggest labels in the music industry for the product's September launch.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Zider to apple lager - country smocks to
urban image / A look at the forthcoming market flotation of Taunton Cider
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TIME WAS when cider conjured up images of the rural English idyll;
felt-capped yokels leaning on five-bar gates, straw between teeth and
scrumpy at hand. More prosaically it was gentlemen of the road, or students,
sliding comatose from their seats after availing of one of the most
cost-effective ways of getting drunk.
Neither image is exactly what the large commercial cider makers want. Over
the past decade, HP Bulmer and Taunton Cider, the UK's two largest
producers, have spent large amounts advertising an altogether different  -
they say contemporary - image.
Among their greatest challenges has been to make a cider that can be drunk
in 'sessionable quantities', a piece of exquisite marketing-speak referring
to the search for a cider whose taste will not stop drinkers in their tracks
after a few pints - even if its strength will.
While cider's image is far from reconstructed, the repositioning of the
product appears to have been remarkably successful. Last year, when the UK
drinks market shrank 5 per cent, cider sales volume rose by 3 per cent in
spite of the bad summer and the recession. From a position of 2.5 per cent
market share 20 years ago, one in every 20 pints drunk in the UK today is
cider.
It is into this background that Taunton Cider, the west country company
founded 90 years ago, is to come to the stock market early next month. The
flotation is likely to put a valuation of Pounds 130m-Pounds 150m on the
company which its management bought from a consortium of brewers, including
Bass, Courage and Scottish &amp; Newcastle, in May last year for Pounds 72.5m.
Such a rapid transition, and at such a premium, might suggest that the
buy-out team bought Taunton for a song. But Mr Peter Adams, chief executive
and managing director since 1987 and one of the team that with employees put
up 15 per cent of the Pounds 3.3m initial capital, insists this was not the
case.
'At the time of the buy-out there was great uncertainty,' he says. 'We had
broken free from our previous partners and there was concern over how well
we could perform.' At the same time the EC was contemplating applying much
higher wine excise duties to cider - a move Brussels has now decided not to
make - and the Gulf war was in full swing. In any case, Schroders, the
merchant bank, oversaw the trade sale to ensure the management team had no
advantage.
While the uncertainty may have been there, foundations were in place for
impressive growth. operating profit rose from Pounds 5m in 1987 to Pounds
12.5m last year and James Capel, the company's brokers, expect operating
profit of Pounds 16m for the year to last April.
'The sea change in the cider market came in the late 1970s when draft cider
became widely available in bars,' says Mr Adams. Taunton's Dry Blackthorn
and Bulmer's Strongbow began to grow rapidly, with Taunton increasing its
market share from 18.7 per cent in 1975 to 33.4 per cent in 1991, compared
to Bulmer's 45 per cent share.
Then in 1986, Taunton launched Diamond White, designed to compete with
premium lagers such as Holsten Pils and Becks, but with a significantly
bigger kick.
This was followed in 1989 with the launch of Red Rock, backed by an
advertising campaign featuring actor Leslie Nielson, star of the US Police
Squad series, that is as expensive as it is eccentric. Red Rock is aimed at
the lager drinker and, Mr Adams says, lacks the bitter-sweet edge of Dry
Blackthorn that tends to sate the palate too quickly for the sake of healthy
sales.
Cider's transformation to something the style-conscious drinker felt good
being seen with is reflected in the premium ciders' share of Taunton's
sales. Growing 20 per cent year on year, premium ciders now account for 25
per cent of Taunton's sales volume and 40 per cent of sales.
These developments were taking place as the brewers' stranglehold on
distribution was being loosened by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
The March 1989 order that there should be more competition between brewers
and a restriction of the tied system gave the buy-out team the opportunity
to go independent, with the prospect of a freer market for their product.
Mr Adams then put his own bid together, backed by Samuel Montagu and Morgan
Grenfell Development Capital, at the same time as he was supplying Schroders
with the information other bidders would need for a trade sale.
Barely 14 months after the successful buy-out, Taunton is ready for the
market and hoping to float at a rating somewhere between Bulmer and Guinness
at a multiple of about 16.
The flotation is likely to raise about Pounds 70m which will be used to
repay all Pounds 41m loan stock and mezzanine debt and all but Pounds 10m of
bank debt, leaving the company with pro-forma gearing of 44 per cent.
It is almost guaranteed to lead to jollity in Taunton where all but eight of
the company's 500 employees became shareholders, albeit on a modest scale,
in the buy-out. A rather larger glass will be raised by Mr Adams' management
team which will be retaining about 4 per cent of the company.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Dunhill to buy Karl Lagerfeld fashion business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR KARL LAGERFELD, the German designer who is one of the brightest stars of
French fashion, yesterday agreed to sell his business to Dunhill Holdings,
the British luxury goods group.
Lord Douro, chairman of Dunhill, said he paid 'less than FFr160m' (Pounds
16m) to buy Karl Lagerfeld from Revillon Luxe, the privately owned French
group which used to control it.
The Karl Lagerfeld business includes a Paris-based haute couture house, a
shop on the exclusive Rue du Faubourg St Honore near the Elysee palace, the
French company's trade marks, a franchise and a network of foreign
boutiques.
In return, Mr Lagerfeld has agreed to again become designer for Dunhill's
Chloe ready-to-wear fashions business, acquired by the British company in
1985. He will present his first Chloe collection in October, said Lord
Douro.
Mr Lagerfeld used to work for Chloe in the 1970s but left when Dunhill took
over. He was hired by Chanel where he is credited with having restored the
group's image and fortunes. It is understood that he will continue to design
collections for Chanel.
'This acquisition is evidence of our strategic objective to have a
significant investment in the female luxury fashion market worldwide,' said
Lord Douro.
'We look forward to further growth in the Lagerfeld and Chloe brand names
over the coming years,' he said. Both brands' distribution and franchise
networks would be enlarged.
There would be no senior management changes, so that Mr Ralph Toledano would
continue as Karl Lagerfeld's managing director and Mr Jean-Claude
Piedelievre will stay on as Chloe's managing director, said Lord Douro.
Several leading Parisian fashion houses are believed to be incurring losses,
after two years' of recession, worsened by the Gulf war. Like most of its
French competitors, Karl Lagerfeld does not publish results. It would be
surprising if it were not affected by the fashion industry downturn.
Dunhill also owns Mont Blanc pens and Hackett, a chain of classic English
clothing stores, as well as marketing its own brands of accessories and
clothes.
Christian Dior, the fashion house which was floated on the Paris stock
exchange last year, yesterday reported a 12.3 per cent net profits increase
for 1991.
The group, owned by Mr Bernard Arnault's Financiere Agache holding group,
made FFr902m net. Operating profits rose from FFr5.89bn to FFr6.53bn. Most
of the increase came from increased sales of champagne, spirits and luxury
baggage, and through Christian Dior's share of profits in the LVMH luxury
goods giant by way of a holding company which has 47.5 per cent of LVMH.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Big Six hit by recession and competition: Accountancy firms
cut staff - Audit work suffers / Growth in insolvency work
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECESSION and competition sharply reduced fee income growth in most of
Britain's six largest accountancy firms, according to figures for the year
to April 1992 released yesterday.
Coopers &amp; Lybrand remained the largest UK firm with fee income of Pounds
577m in the year to April 30, but also registered the only absolute decline,
with revenues down by 1.87 per cent.
All the top firms except Arthur Andersen cut professional staff including
partners by between 7 per cent and 10 per cent, reflecting the widespread
redundancies in the last few months.
Income from three of Coopers' divisions - audit, management consultancy and
tax - all declined, while insolvency income rose by 16 per cent. But the
firm said last year's reported Pounds 588m income had been adjusted
downwards to Pounds 577m, reflecting difficulties in calculation after the
merger with Deloitte Haskins &amp; Sells. The name Deloitte was also officially
dropped yesterday.
Strongest growth came from Arthur Andersen, mainly as a result of a 30 per
cent increase from Andersen Consulting. 'We're working with major
organisations which believe there's going to be a better tomorrow,' said Mr
Keith Burgess, head of the consulting arm.
Touche Ross also grew sharply, with income up by 15.7 per cent. Mr John
Roques, senior partner, said the increase reflected work referred from its
network of firms overseas, particularly in the USA and Japan, growing
consultancy work in Europe, and advice to medium-sized companies.
Revenue growth in the remaining firms - KPMG Peat Marwick, Ernst &amp; Young,
and Price Waterhouse - was boosted by insolvency work but struggled to beat
inflation.
Mr Ian Brindle, senior partner of Price Waterhouse, said audit work was
suffering because of recession, overcapacity and intense competition.
However, none of the firms is willing to provide details of costs or profits
distributed to partners, stressing their legal status as partnerships does
not require them to do so.
They also argue it is very difficult to compare firms, which have different
year-ends and sometimes exclude income from regions such as the Channel
Islands. They say that some - particularly Andersen Consulting - operate in
distinctive markets and are not direct competitors.
Most of the managers in the firms suggested that the rapid income growth
experienced during the 1980s was unlikely to be repeated in the near future.
'Double-digit growth will tend to be a thing of the past,' said Mr Elwyn
Eilledge, senior partner of Ernst &amp; Young. 'We are concentrating now on
managing the numbers to suit our business.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Serbs defy UN to hit Sarajevo: Energy supplies may be
rationed as international sanctions begin to bite
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bosnian capital of Sarajevo last night came under heavy bombardment from
Serb irregular forces in defiance of United Nations sanctions and an
agreement to implement a ceasefire.
The bombardment, which started less than two hours after the ceasefire was
due to come into effect, appeared to indicate that power is passing to local
Serbian warlords in Sarajevo and opposing Bosnian militia groups.
The renewed fighting raises the question of whether authorities in Belgrade,
the capital of Serbia, can control their irregular forces.
In response to the sanctions, Serbia yesterday sent General Zivota Panic,
commander of the Yugoslav federal army, to Sarajevo where he was due to hold
talks with Bosnia's President Alija Izetbegovic. The two were to discuss
implementing the ceasefire, which was to start at 1600 GMT yesterday.
The fighting took place as Serbia prepared for energy rationing to offset
the impact of the sanctions, designed to put pressure on the republic to
stop the war in Bosnia-Hercegovina. President Slobodan Milosevic vowed that
Serbs would never bow to international pressure. 'The people have said that
they want to be masters of their own destiny,' he said.
The sanctions, as tough as those imposed on Iraq in 1990, are already
beginning to bite. Mr Nikola Sainovic, Serbia's minister of energy, said oil
derivatives would soon be 'conserved', a signal that rationing was planned.
In the run-up to the deadline set for the ceasefire yesterday, Sarajevo
Radio reported that Serb militia had bombarded the city hall. One person was
killed and three were injured. According to the radio, at least 30 people
have been killed and 115 wounded in the past 24 hours in Bosnia and on the
borders with Croatia.
In Belgrade, President Milosevic said 'the great results' of Sunday's
parliamentary and local elections, which the main opposition parties
boycotted, supported the government's defiant stand.
'They (the results) are a reply to all those enemies outside, and
internally, who have conducted a campaign against the elections. The results
are of enormous significance for the democratic process,' he added. Final
results have not been announced.
The UN said it would begin talks today with the warring parties to try to
open Sarajevo airport for humanitarian supplies. In Belgrade, people were
buying up household goods while the long petrol queues grew even longer. The
black market currency rate in Belgrade rose sharply from 1,300 dinars to the
dollar to more than 1,700. The official rate is 323 dinars to the dollar.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Letter: The myth surrounding vocational training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms LESLEY ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I express my amusement at your article 'Vocational tests body comes
under attack' (May 28). Part of the problem in this debate is that everyone
is trying to compare apples with pears.
The competence-based approach quite rightly (if you are an employer) insists
that the key issue is that an individual demonstrates his or her ability to
do a particular job competently. It recognises that, to do so, the person
needs some theoretical knowledge, but it focuses primarily on the
acquisition of appropriate skills. How sensible]
The traditional academic approach quite rightly (if you are trying to
develop an academic) concentrates on giving a large amount of knowledge but
training the student in a limited range of skills, primarily research,
analysis and argument.
Unfortunately, somewhere along the road a lot of business training was
developed using the academic model. The competency approach is demonstrating
just how poorly the other translates into practical skills. This is the real
cause for all the academic sound and fury.
Your own final paragraph continued with the woolly thinking and typical
British snobbery that has dominated this debate. It implies that it is
strange to consider a set of practical competences, including handling
documents and answering phone calls, as equivalent to a GCSE. Why?
As both a graduate in physics and an experienced manager, I find no
difficulty in recognising the breadth of competences defined by the
Management Charter Initiative level 1 (NVQ level 4) for example, as broadly
equivalent to my degree course.
Yours is a respected newspaper; please do not continue to propagate the myth
that the ability to demonstrate academic knowledge is much more difficult or
important than demonstrating a range of administrative, managerial or
practical skills.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Letter: Rates burden having destructive effect on empty
properties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr MICHAEL PATTISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The present 'empty rates' regime is leading to a depressing bout of
destruction similar to that of the 1980s when roofs were taken off factories
to escape liability for rates. Industrial property and warehouses have since
become exempt, but offices remain liable. We know of one major plc currently
thinking of 'stripping out' an office block in the City in order to avoid a
rate liability of Pounds 1.5m. The property would have little potential for
redevelopment even in a bullish market. The current state of the market
makes it virtually unlettable.
The government must act immediately to stop this destructive course. The
period of grace should be extended from three months to one year and the
liability itself reduced to 40 per cent followed by further phased
reductions. Unless action is taken, this highly destructive process of
'stripping out' is bound to continue. Such a situation does little to
enhance the image of our system of business taxation, the prestige of the
City of London and the position of business ratepayers generally.
The Non-Domestic Rating Bill currently before parliament will do much to
help businesses suffering from the combined effect of the introduction of
the uniform business rate and the 1990 revaluation. But the bill offers no
help to those businesses facing huge liabilities for property which is
unoccupied.
Empty rate liability - currently 50 per cent of the total liability
following a three-month period of grace after occupation ceases - was
introduced to discourage developers from deliberately keeping property
empty. The notorious case of Centre Point in the 1960s highlighted the
problem. Since then, however, times have changed and nobody welcomes having
empty property on their hands.
The collapse of the commercial property market - the effects of which have
been particularly marked in the City of London - has thrown the unfairness
of empty rate liability into stark relief.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Key is not to produce less - but differently / Exploring the
meaning of sustainable development and the difficulties of putting this idea
into practice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
How could anyone be in favour of 'unsustainable development'? It would be
like favouring matricide, the victim being Mother Earth.
Yet what precisely is 'sustainable development'? Sustainable development,
says the World Commission on Environment and Development, consists of 'forms
of progress which meet the needs of the present without compromising the
ability of future generations to meet their needs'.
That does not make one wiser. Try this, instead: '. . . In the end,
sustainable development is not a fixed state of harmony, but rather a
process of change in which the exploitation of resources, the direction of
investments, the orientation of technological development, and institutional
change are made consistent with future as well as present needs.'
This is merely wordier. What, above all, are future needs? Citizens of rich
countries would number among them a standard of living at least as high as
that enjoyed today. To most of the world's poor that would be no more
related to 'need' than is a Rolls-Royce motor car to cost-effective
transportation. Fundamentalist environmentalists, who often advocate
something like the medieval manorial economy, would agree.
How then can the concept of 'sustainable development' be made operational?
One way is to recommend that the capital stock be maintained. More narrowly
still, it is suggested that not the total capital stock, but the stock of
natural resources alone should be maintained. The reason for this
restriction is evident. How many miles of road are worth one rhinoceros?
Among the rules suggested for use of the natural capital stock is that there
should be 'no net losses', meaning that any natural resources should be
replaced. Another is 'assume the worst': any action affecting the
environment is guilty, unless proved innocent.
Yet how many acres of wetlands compensate for a forest? Is a glamorous
species on the savanna worth two obscure ones in the rain forest? Unless one
advocates the impossible - actions that have no deleterious effect on any
ecosystem - the commandment that natural capital must be preserved takes one
little further.
The World Commission asserts that sustainable development, 'with its concern
for the needs of people today and tomorrow, is ultimately a moral and
ethical issue'. But that is all it appears to be. It is not a policy.
Nevertheless, one thought is buried within it: that the globe's ecosystems
have limited carrying capacity.
The idea has intuitive appeal. Over the last generation gross global product
(GGP) has been growing at more than 3 per cent a year. At that rate, GGP
would be 1,600 times greater 250 years from now. Either growth would have
ceased long before, or the composition of output would be so different as to
be incomparable. Just contrast today's output with that of 1742.
This notion is the basis for the relative optimism of the World Bank's World
Development Report on Development and the Environment. 'The key to growing
sustainably is not to produce less,' it opines, 'but to produce
differently.'
The report argues that there is no linear relationship between economic
activity and environmental damage. On the contrary, the emission of many
important pollutants has declined with development. This may not be true of
municipal waste and carbon dioxide emissions, which have continued to rise
with income. But that, suggests the report, is because there have been no
incentives for changed behaviour.
The World Bank asserts that the link between economic growth and the
environment depends on four factors:
structure: the goods and services produced;
efficiency: the quantity of inputs per unit of output;
substitution: the ability to substitute for scarce resources; and
technology and management: the environmental damage per unit of input or
output.
The report also offers a strategy for 'sustainable development', defining
that term as 'development that lasts'. This has three elements:
build on the positive links: many policies that promote growth - appropriate
energy prices, for example - will also improve the environment;
break the negative links: introduce appropriate incentives and
disincentives; and
clarify and manage uncertain links: where the consequences of human activity
are unknown, the response should be the search for further information,
combined with precautionary measures.
How can sustaining the natural environment or, where possible, improving it
be made consistent with development? The problem is market failure, the way
people can ignore the environment in their economic decisions. The solution
is to introduce environmental incentives.
Unfortunately, this conclusion is more easily written than implemented.
First, the use of non-marketed, but scarce resources, has to be reflected in
corporate and national accounts.
Second, rational incentives to improve the environment have to be introduced
against entrenched vested interests.
Third, many important environmental goods (and bads) - species diversity,
the composition of the atmosphere, the number of children people have -
cannot be property. Others, like rain forests, are difficult to protect.
Polluters should pay. But how much? And who will make them?
Fourth, turning hitherto 'free' goods into property or taxing their use
redistributes wealth, sometimes massively. Equally intractable
distributional questions arise when valuing the welfare of future
generations against that of those living now.
Finally, some problems run across frontiers. A few affect everyone.
Establishing, enforcing and distributing rights to pollute across countries
is vastly more difficult than doing that within them.
Nothing raises more difficulties than global warming. Both the size of the
threat and its potential economic costs are uncertain; the costs of lower
emissions for important interests would be large; the atmosphere is not
appropriable; emissions can only be monitored with difficulty; the way in
which rights to emit carbon dioxide are allocated would affect the
international distribution of income; and overall reductions in emissions
would influence inter-generational income distribution as well.
No wonder, developing countries argue that the rich countries want them to
stay poor, merely so that they themselves can continue their profligacy. No
wonder, too, that developing countries believe they now have goods to offer
 -more trees, more species, less carbon-dioxide - that the rich want still
more than they do.
Rio is just a start to the hard bargaining ahead. If environmental market
failure is, in fact, as great a problem as many now believe, a world as
divided as ours seems unlikely to deliver a solution.

While there is no such thing as a recession-proof industry, canny investors
might do worse than inspect the UK brassiere market. According to the
research organisation Mintel, British women spent Pounds 450m on 84m bras in
1991, up from Pounds 388m on 71m in 1989. The market is also changing shape.
There is a 'a swing towards the more glamorously styled, underwired bra',
and the average size has gone up to 36C from 34B in just ten years. The
manufacturers are putting the increase down to 'more exercise and the use of
the pill'.

When it comes to political infighting, Italy's bankers are almost as
professional as their legislative neighbours. Hence there is some relief
that technocrat Giuseppe Zadra has seen off the opposition and collected the
directorship of Italy's bankers' association.
In many other countries the post would be regarded as a restbed for weary
commercial bankers. But not Italy. At a time when the country's fragmented
and inefficient banking system is on the brink of substantial change, Zadra
will be in a powerful position to influence the cause of sensible reform. He
will not be as easily swayed off course by political undercurrents as some
previous incumbents.
During his seven years as head of the stock market division at Consob,
Italy's stock exchange and companies' watchdog, the 51-year-old Zadra helped
transform Italian equity trading. A fluent English-speaker he has been a
tough defender of the new bourse rules against foreign critics.
Tancredi Bianchi, the professor of banking who chairs the bankers'
association, was so desperate to recruit Zadra that he reportedly threatened
to resign himself, if his colleagues baulked at his choice.

If Marcus Davison, a 42-year-old banker, had hung around at National
Westminster Bank as long as young Derek Wanless did, then he too might have
stood a chance of being group chief executive of Britain's second biggest
bank. However, Davison, like most of the more ambitious young graduates
entering British banking in the early 1970s, was bitten by the international
banking bug and therein lies a tale.
Whereas Wanless, a contemporary of Davison's at NatWest, has risen farther
and faster than anyone imagined, equally ambitious bankers such as Davison
have kept on losing their commands. Davison's first port of call after
NatWest was dear old Western American Bank, a casualty of the recession
before last. He left before the ship went down but was less lucky last week
when he lost his finance director's job after the the plug was pulled on DG
Investment Bank.
Can any reader beat Davison's unfortunate career record? All of the six
banks he has worked for are now but a memory in the headhunters' files. The
name plates of Davison's old employers such as European Asian Bank, European
Banking Company, and Philadelphia National Limited, have long since
disappeared. Indeed, Davison now wonders whether he should write to
prospective employers asking them to make him a modest subscription in
return for his promise never to darken their doors as an employee. With this
sort of capital he should be able to start his own bank.

It seems that gangsters wanting to quit their gang, following Japan's recent

However, an entrepreneurial doctor from the north of the country has offered

Anglo American, having long resisted token appointments of blacks to its
board, has now leapt into the deep end by making sociologist Dr Mamphela
Ramphele a non-executive director.
While Anglo is doubtless pleased about the symbolic effect of having a black
woman on the board, there is nothing tokenistic in the appointment. Indeed,
chairman Julian Ogilvie Thompson's comment that she 'would bring a new
aspect to our deliberations' is an understatement.
Ramphele, a close friend of martyred black activist Steve Biko, who died in
police detention in 1976, is a formidable personality, likely to subject
Anglo's corporate practices to gruelling scrutiny. Indeed, the dialogue
between her and Anglo hard men like Graham Boustred and Lesley Boyd would be
worth paying good money to listen to.
A deputy vice-chancellor at Cape Town university, Ramphele made her name as
co-author with Dr Francis Wilson of an acclaimed study on poverty. She has
been helping Anglo in research to define affordable programmes to alleviate
hardship.
The company will have been attracted by Ramphele's robust liberalism,
combining championship of the oppressed with the tenet that the state must
not encourage a culture of entitlement. But will it be enough to stop those
who want Anglo broken up?

FT  02 JUN 92 / The charge of the pension brigade: As UK regulations come
under scrutiny / A look at the pressures building over the Maxwell affair
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The sight of pensioners lobbying MPs at Westminster next Monday will be a
graphic reminder of the hardship caused by the failure of schemes controlled
by the late Mr Robert Maxwell - and of the pensioners' expectation that the
government should play some part in easing their plight.
Since the election, the efforts of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell
pensioners have become more urgent. An all-party group of MPs was set up
last month and now numbers more than 100, including some ministers. The
subject of pensions' safeguards is moving up the political agenda as the
group steps up its activities: tomorrow it will meet to discuss how to exert
pressure on banks to help bail out those who lost their life savings in
Maxwell pension funds.
''Pensioner' is a very emotive word,' said Mr Richard Thomas, a director of
Law Debenture Corporation, the independent trustee to the Maxwell
Communication Corporation Pension Scheme. 'The role of government is to
protect its most defenceless individuals.'
More than 30,000 were left without immediate protection after Mr Maxwell
disappeared over the side of his luxury yacht last November and auditors
discovered Pounds 400m was missing from the total assets of Pounds 695m in
pension schemes he controlled. Already, 240 members of one Leeds-based
scheme have had their monthly pension cheques stopped, while 5,000 members
of another scheme face a 70 per cent cut in benefits by next month.
The five Maxwell company pension schemes have 32,710 members. Of these,
14,110 are already pensioners, highlighting the extent of the government's
dilemma. The largest scheme, representing more than 12,000 present and
former Mirror Group Newspaper employees, is being shored up by contributions
from the employer. However, the scheme includes hundreds of members who
worked for a separate Maxwell company, and Mirror Group has said it will not
guarantee the pensions of those individuals.
If any more Maxwell funds stop paying pensions at the end of this month, the
government is likely to come under renewed pressure from the group of MPs.
'That is when it will get nasty and spill over on to the floor of the
Commons,' said Labour MP Mr Frank Field, co-chairman of the all-party group.
Ministers have so far rejected the group's plan for a 'drip feed' from the
government to enable the schemes to continue paying while assets are pursued
by independent trustees. The idea of a drip feed, put forward by Mr Richard
Page, the Tory MP who co-chairs the group, was intended as a temporary
measure until the assets could be located and the most pressing obligations
(legal and moral) could be determined.
Ministers are awaiting a report by the Securities and Investments Board, the
City's regulatory watchdog, into the role played by Imro, the
self-regulatory body for the fund management industry, in overseeing
Bishopsgate Investment Management, Mr Maxwell's fund management company.
Pensioners argue that Imro, and by extension the government, did not fulfil
its regulatory duties with regard to BIM. It is alleged that BIM allowed
securities belonging to the five Maxwell pension schemes to be 'loaned' to
other Maxwell-related businesses. These were then used, it is alleged, by Mr
Maxwell as collateral for loans from UK and international banks. 'There will
be political pressure on the government to move very, very quickly once SIB
is out,' Mr Page commented. 'It would be unwise not to be there ready with a
statement, a position and a series of decisions.'
MPs, however, are far from convinced that the government should pick up the
entire bill - which could amount to Pounds 150m-Pounds 200m - to compensate
Maxwell pensioners. What they do agree on is that the pensioners have a
strong moral case for help from somewhere. Under the law they had no choice
about where to invest their funds, or indeed whether to contribute to an
occupational pension scheme at all. Until 1988, all employees were required
to contribute to a pension scheme if an employer offered one.
While the idea of a government-funded compensation scheme has not garnered
wide support at Westminster, the government appears to have softened its
position slightly. Miss Ann Widdecombe, a junior social security minister,
said it would be 'irresponsible' for the government to consider such a fund
before investigations into the disappearance of the missing Maxwell assets
are complete - but she said nothing had been ruled out.
As political pressure grows at Westminster, the group of 100 MPs is
switching its focus from Whitehall to the City, and to the Bank of England
in particular. They want the Bank to exert pressure on commercial banks to
return some of the securities they received on behalf of Maxwell companies.
Some ministers are joining forces with the pensioners' lobbyists to urge the
banks to acknowledge their moral obligations. For their part, the banks say
that they are studying the matter, but they point out that they accepted the
securities in good faith and had no way of knowing that they were pension
fund assets.
Mr Field and Mr Page were encouraged when they saw Mr Peter Lilley, the
social security secretary, recently by his undertaking to pass on their
criticisms to the Bank of England. Last week, Mr Page wrote to Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, asking him to put pressure on the Bank to take a
more active view of its supervisory role.
The failure of Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, the governor of the Bank, to
acknowledge publicly that the Bank played a rather too passive role in the
Maxwell affair is likely to result in some uncomfortable questions from the
group of MPs. The Bank's reluctance to become involved in seeking a solution
is also likely to raise some uneasy questions about City regulation in
general.
'If the Bank steps back from this it is saying it has no role in regulating
the City: it would be entirely wrong for the Bank to step back. This strikes
at the fundamental core of how the City runs itself and the basis on which
transactions take place,' said Mr David Shaw, Tory MP for Dover and another
leading member of the MPs' group. He said the entire structure of
self-regulation in the City had been called into question, and described as
'profoundly unsatisfactory' the prospect of MPs shuttling about in taxis
from one regulator to another in search of a single voice to speak for the
City.
His remarks echo the findings of the all-party social security committee of
MPs in the last parliament. Its report on the Maxwell affair commented that
the most striking result of months of hearings was that no single body or
individual appeared to have full responsibility for monitoring pension fund
activities. 'Pontius Pilate would have blushed at the spectacle of so many
witnesses washing their hands in public before the committee of their
responsibilities in this affair.'
One of the main recommendations of the committee will now be implemented. Mr
Lilley is about to announce a government review of pension law, although not
specifically within the suggested nine-month timescale.
The review will address the fundamental question of the status and ownership
of pension funds, but is also set to include other select committee
proposals such as: the appointment of independent custodian trustees to hold
pension-fund assets, all with clearly designated ownership; the annual right
of every pensioner to transfer his or her assets from a pension scheme to
another recognised financial institution; and the right of pensioners and
contributors to veto transfers of assets to another scheme.
It is also likely to look at the concerns already voiced by Imro, about the
difficulties of marrying trust law - the legal framework governing pension
funds - and financial services legislation. The strengthening of the
Occupational Pensions Board to police a new regime will also be considered.
Now that a portion of the pensions industry has accepted that some sort of
compensation fund is needed, one problem is the form the fund would take.
The US, Japan and most European countries, including France and Germany,
already have such funds. Setting one up in the UK would entail an overhaul
of current pension law because the fund would insist that any scheme covered
by it met minimum standards.
Mr Brian McMahon, chairman of the National Association of Pension Funds, the
industry trade association, has called for scheme members to be eligible to
apply to the Investors Compensation Scheme set up under the 1987 Financial
Services Act. The ICS allows investors to receive up to Pounds 48,000 in
total compensation - a paltry sum compared with the potential benefits lost
when a pension scheme collapses.
The NAPF has also embarked on a feasibility study of a separate compensation
fund. This would be an additional safety net for pensioners whose schemes
had failed without sufficient assets to meet all liabilities. One proposal
is that it be funded by a levy on all UK pension schemes - an idea which has
proved divisive. 'On the basis of my postbag, there isn't much support for
it,' Mr McMahon said. 'The postbag tends to be from the larger schemes who
say they run good schemes. They don't want to bail out the likes of Robert
Maxwell.'
Clearly, neither the government nor the industry wants to pay for a
compensation fund. The government is waiting to assess exactly how much
funding would be needed and to see whether the banks will return some of the
securities received on behalf of Mr Maxwell. The industry, on the other
hand, wants to reassure pension scheme members that their savings will not
disappear if a company fails, but it does not want to underwrite pension
fund abuse by an open-ended commitment to a compensation fund.
Over the longer term the government review will be of immense significance
for an industry that has operated in an almost unregulated environment. But
it will do little for the Maxwell pensioners because they would be outside
the scope of any future legislation.
Mr Page compared their position with that of passengers on the Titanic, if
they had known that its sinking would lead to new international regulations
about lifeboats and safety at sea. 'I'm sure they would be delighted that in
future people would have more protection, but they are bound to be
concentrating on their own predicament.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The next step in housing
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE chancellor, Mr Norman Lamont, meets representatives of the leading
building societies this afternoon, he and his ministerial colleagues will no
doubt be given reassuring news about repossessions in the housing market.
And there is indeed room for modest reassurance: while repossessions remain
at historically high levels, the trend has unquestionably improved in the
first few months of the year.
Yet it could hardly have been otherwise. Since the government and the
building societies agreed in December on a package of measures to help
stabilise the housing market, nominal interest rates have fallen further and
income support for mortgage interest has been paid direct to lenders,
automatically reducing the risk that borrowers will go into default. In
addition the societies have recognised the advantages of keeping
overstretched mortgagors in the property. With the aid of counselling and
renegotiation, otherwise shaky borrowers have been kept afloat to the
benefit of both parties.
What is clear at this point is that the improvement in the figures owes
precious little to the attempt to encourage defaulting mortgagors to become
housing association tenants in the former owner-occupied property. Those who
have escaped the problems of the rented sector for the financial strains of
home ownership appear singularly reluctant to rejoin the tenantry. The
scheme has anyway been criticised for its legal complexity. And from the
building societies' point of view the economics look unfavourable, since
former owner-occupied property does not enjoy the grants that enable housing
associations to charge low rents on new property.
Enormous pressures
That said, it is hard to see a chancellor who faces enormous pressures on
public finances being prepared to contemplate the cost of equalising the
financial position of these two forms of tenure. Nor does it seem likely
that Mr Lamont will accede to the demands of those who would like to see his
temporary relief against stamp duty extended beyond the summer. If it has
failed to kick-start the market into a significantly higher level of
transactions by now, its point has been lost. The question is why it has
failed and what else the government should do, if anything, to help.
By past standards the relationship between house prices and earnings, which
was distorted during the boom of the late 1980s, is back to its long-term
trend level. House prices appear affordable again. Yet buyers remain
elusive.
Affordable prices
One explanation might be the caution-inducing persistence of high real rates
of interest after a decade in which the personal sector doubled its
indebtedness in relation to household income. Another could be that buyers
expect prices to look even more affordable in due course. That is far from
implausible if the first big fall in nominal house prices since the war
causes the speculative investment premium in housing to disappear - an
outcome that could be reinforced by the erosion of the real value of
mortgage interest relief and the less favourable trend in household
formation that is expected later in the decade. Against that background,
house prices might well be expected to settle at a lower multiple of
earnings than hitherto.
A more tangible factor behind the low volume of transactions is that between
half a million and a million buyers are reckoned to have a negative equity
in their homes, whereby the mortgage exceeds the value of the house. They
are stuck on the bottom rung of the housing ladder and unable to move. It is
here that the housing market slump is doing economic, as well as social,
damage. In the absence of a more flexible private rented sector, job
mobility is reduced.
Existing legislation prevents the building societies from transferring
mortgages to a new property by stipulating that they cannot lend more than
100 per cent of value. Where housing equity is already negative this
prudential requirement is academic. It also acts as a needless constraint on
labour market flexibility. The chancellor should explore the case for a
limited relaxation of the legislation to cope with this unexpected
consequence of the collapse in house prices.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The isolation of Serbia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HORROR of the human tragedy provoked by Serbia, first in Croatia and
more recently in Bosnia-Hercegovina, has at last persuaded the international
community to take action. Predictably, critics now maintain that the
sanctions adopted by the United Nations Security Council last Saturday have
come much too late and should have been approved at least nine months ago.
But the necessary consensus was not forthcoming at the time and the US, in
particular, made it plain that it did not want to get involved in a far-off
ethnic conflict which did not seem to threaten wider international security.
There is little point now in pursuing the argument whether the European
Community is more to blame for its incapacity to solve the Yugoslav crisis
in the first place, or the US, for washing its hands of the whole affair
until outraged domestic public opinion forced the Administration to change
its mind. What is certain is that international solutions to crises of this
magnitude still require the involvement and commitment of the only remaining
superpower, the US.
In spite of the mixed results that international sanctions have had in the
past and the bluster of Mr Slobodan Milosevic, the Serbian leader, who
boasts that the Serbian economy can survive in spite of them, there is every
indication that sanctions will bite deep. This is particularly true of the
oil embargo, given that Serbia is dependent for some 75 per cent of its oil
needs on foreign suppliers such as Russia, China, Romania and Angola. In the
circumstances, it is hard to see how its military effort can be maintained
indefinitely, though civilian users of cars and fuel will probably be made
to pay the biggest price to keep the military machine going.
Popular opposition
Equally important will be the effect that shortages, the inconvenience
caused to travellers by the suspension of international flights and the
disappointment for a football-obsessed people of seeing its team banned from
the European championship finals in Sweden, will have on national morale and
Mr Milosevic's political standing. The demonstration in Belgrade at the
week-end by some 50,000 anti-war protesters was an indication that popular
opposition to his policies is growing, at least in the capital.
The peace movement in Serbia, however, is mainly middle class-based. It
would be an illusion to believe that it finds much of an echo in the rural
Serb and Montenegrin population, not least the Serbs in Bosnia, who look
upon the Belgrade government as their main protector and champion. Indeed,
Mr Milosevic is far from being his own man in Bosnia, where the leaders of
ultra-nationalist irregular Serbian military units are even accusing him of
being too soft.
Perverse effect
There is clearly a risk, therefore, that UN sanctions could have the
perverse effect of giving a boost to Serbian nationalism. Even if the
Belgrade government were to have a change of heart as the result of
international pressure, regional nationalist groups might well decide to
pursue their crusade. The Yugoslav partisans demonstrated during the Second
World War how effective they were at guerrilla warfare.
If the international community were to wait until Serbia is economically
exhausted or Mr Milosevic is overthrown, it could wait for a very long time.
Sanctions must be given a fair chance to bring Mr Milosevic to his senses,
but if they fail, what then?
International military action can no longer be ruled out as a longer term
option. As in the Gulf crisis, such operations would have to be sanctioned
by the Security Council, though they would probably have to be undertaken by
surrogate organisations such as Nato or the Western European Union. Military
action should be restricted to air strikes against strategic targets. It
would be most unwise to contemplate sending ground forces, since they might
become stuck in Yugoslavia indefinitely and suffer politically unacceptable
losses.
But whatever action is finally decided, it is essential that it should be
taken by the international community as a whole including the US, which
alone has the clout to bring transgressors of international law to heel.
Anything less, as has been proved conclusively, is doomed to failure.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Arts: A surrealist cast of symbols - Sculpture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Phillip King, the lately retired Professor of Sculpture at the Royal College
of Art, is now 58. He read Modern Languages at Cambridge before turning to
sculpture, which he studied under Anthony Caro at St Martin's in the late
1950s, followed by a brief stint, around 1960, as an assistant to Henry
Moore.
Late vocation or not, his critical success was almost immediate. He was a
particular star of Bryan Robertson's seminal New Generation show at the
Whitechapel Gallery in 1965; a trustee of the Tate by 1967; CBE by 1974; ARA
by 1977; and subject of a full retrospective at the Hayward Gallery by 1981.
All the while there has been a constant stream of shows at home and abroad,
regular solo shows of current work with the old Rowan Gallery, and
significant contributions to group exhibitions.
In short, King is a substantial and influential figure in his generation, an
artist with a truly international reputation. Or is he?
Any artist, in shifting the course of art in his turn, though by only a
little, only adds to its impetus and the capacity of those who follow to
shift it further in their turn. Our much vaunted British Sculpture, in
received opinion our one consistent and truly significant contribution to
the world's art in the 20th century, is carried on by other, younger hands.
If King's reputation has lain somewhat in the shadows since the apparent
zenith some 10 years ago or more, the show at the Yorkshire Sculpture Park,
along with Tim Hilton's timely and invaluable monograph, affords us the
proper occasion to bring it once more, quite literally, out into the light
of day.
King's work is, of course, no stranger to the open air, but with such public
monuments as the 'Clarion' at Fulham Broadway, and the 'Diamond Sculpture'
beside the road at Street in Somerset, it is more familiar in an urban of
industrial than a rural context. Also, his early use of bright, unnatural
colour and apparently insubstantial materials, and the long, inevitable
practice of showing even the most monumental of the works inside the
gallery, have conspired in the common belief that the true place for his
sculpture is indoors.
Only to the comparative few of his public, familiar with the sculpture
garden of his long-time dealer, Alex Gregory-Hood at Loxley in Warwickshire,
will this splendidly bucolic display in the park at Bretton Hall come as no
surprise.
Even to them, with so many definitive pieces on show, the urge to modify
both expectation and judgment is irresistible. For what emerges is not just
that these things look so much at home on the grassy slopes beneath the
trees, but rather that brightly coloured or drab and natural, they display a
remarkable consistency both in their imaginative preoccupation and formal
development.
The differences are clear enough: the hints at figurative reference in the
earliest; the overt figuration in the latest works; and, in between, works
in which formal and material considerations are over-riding. Yet, whichever
it is, what brings it so to sit happily with the oeuvre at large is an
unmistakable sense, not just of space occupied and articulated, but of a
place established and enclosed.
Given the open nature of so many of the structures in the purely formal
sense, this may seem a somewhat contradictory thing to say but, even so, it
holds good. Stonehenge may be open now to all the winds that blow, but its
sense of enclosure and, more than that, of being enclosed to some purpose,
is undeniable. And by how much is the same true of ruins of all kinds,
whether of castles or cottages, temples, tombs, sacred graves?
If King does not make the point himself, the works make it for him in a
remarkable combination of sculptures, set out more or less across the slope
and half-way down the hill toward the lake. On either side sit two works of
1977, 'Open Place' and 'Sure Place', each a low slanting structure,
deceptively tumbled, of slabs of slate set into a steel framework. In
between are two bright and open structures, arched and sprung, not so much
higher and with the same scope across the ground. They could hardly be more
different, and yet so very much the same: the dome, the canopy, the tent,
the tomb.
So back it is to those earliest things, to 'Genghis Khan' of 1963, dark blue
against the green and what might be a great swirling cape or tent surmounted
by an imperious set of heraldic antlers. On to the most recent things, to
the clouds and the arcades and tumbled elements, redolent of Giacometti and
de Chirico, Picasso and Miro: and again, King sets out the same contained
space, though now a stage, as it were, on which to put his discrete
surrealist cast of symbols - the hand, the ball, the moon.
Those latest, openly surrealist works may seem something of an arbitrary
break in the natural development, romantic as ever but a conscious rejection
of the abstract and the formal. Shown as they are, however, in the pavilion
in the upper garden alongside a group of the earliest things, colourful
pyramids and cones fraught with a latent surrealism, they seem less so, less
certainly than they did new and alone a year or two ago.
Who knows where they may tend? But an artist in mid-career is the master of
is own direction, and the professor, Emeritus now, has yet to collect his
bus pass. Already the work comes together, all of a piece. There is plenty
of time.

FT  02 JUN 92 / People: Hanson to groom its media image
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hanson, Britain's eighth biggest company, has recruited Aviva Gershuny-Roth,
who made her name as a property marketing whiz, to improve its lacklustre
media image.
The 34-year-old Gershuny-Roth will report to vice-chairman Martin Taylor who
has been the group's principal spokesman to date.
Unlike most large companies Hanson has not spent much time grooming its
media image because it felt its financial performance spoke for itself.
Lord Hanson did hire Michael Shea, a former press secretary to the Queen, as
director of public affairs in 1987.
However, Shea has spent most of his time cultivating Hanson's contacts with
Westminster rather than the City. As a consequence, when Hanson took a near
3 per cent stake in Imperial Chemical Industries last year, it was
unprepared for the level of media attention - and criticism - that it
received.
It has been known for some months that Hanson has been seeking an in-house
professional to handle its corporate communications.
Nevertheless, Gershuny-Roth's appointment will surprise some Hanson
watchers. For the last 15 months she has been involved in the marketing of
Olympia &amp; York's ill-fated Canary Wharf development in London's docklands
and before that she spent nine years with Savills, the up-market firm of
chartered surveyors.
Although she is well regarded, her expertise in marketing property is not
exactly an obvious qualification for looking after the image of a company
such as Hanson which employs a workforce of more than 70,000 worldwide.

FT  02 JUN 92 / People: GA looks for change
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The promotion of Bob Scott to the board of General Accident Fire and Life
Assurance, the UK operating board of the Perth-based insurance composite is
symptomatic of the wind of change at the traditionally cautious Scottish
company.
An Australian who has spent much of his working life in New Zealand, Scott
came into the GA fold following the takeover of NZI in 1987.
He then moved to the UK in 1990 to spearhead a restructuring of the
company's sluggish UK operations.
Now 50, he is one of a number of younger executives to emerge at GA in
recent years. The finance director, Barry Holder, is in his mid-40s.
It has been a tough two years. GA has rationalised its branch structure,
cutting over a thousand jobs, and has survived a confrontation with brokers
over its determination to sell a greater percentage of its home and motor
policies directly to the public.
Yesterday's appointment is an indication that Scott has impressed the powers
that be in Perth.
After two years of heavy underwriting losses, GA's first quarter results
were last month showing glimmers of a turnround in the company's UK
performance.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Technology: Here's one for the road / Describing plans to
co-ordinate Britain's street works
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HOLDSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the road outside your house has just been resurfaced, you can be sure
that it won't be long before someone comes along with a pneumatic drill and
digs a hole in it.
For years, street works have been poorly co-ordinated in the UK, with the
gas, water and electricity boards and the local highway authority often
ignorant of each other's plans.
A marked improvement is likely from this October, however, when the New
Roads and Street Works Act 1991 goes live. The new laws, replacing existing
legislation drafted in the 1930s, will improve communication between
utilities and increase the highway authorities' responsibility for
co-ordination.
Under the new Act, local authorities must keep a register of all street
works, and from 1994 that register will be held on a computer. A single,
national database will eventually hold details of all the country's street
works and the list will be updated as utilities and highway authorities
exchange information by electronic mail.
Whereas under the old Public Utilities Street Works Act (Puswa), there are
three kinds of road works - major, minor, and emergency - the electronic
register will have to cope with a host of new definitions. Certain streets,
for example, have been deemed 'traffic sensitive' and any street works on
them would require a longer period of notice.
The total number of messages which utilities and authorities send to each
other is also expected to increase by as much as 50 per cent. This is
because for the first time local authorities must give warning of anything
that is likely to effect the motorist, be it a manhole inspection or the
London marathon.
Even though the computer system won't be ready until 1994, authorities must
comply with the new Act from this October. While they wait, councils are
having to develop interim systems which in most cases will be based on fax
machines and the post.
The thinking behind the computer system stems from 1985 when Puswa was
heavily criticised by a government report which, among other things, called
for a national Computerised Street Works Register (CSWR). Since then,
highway authorities and utilities have been working to develop improved
codes of practice, and their representative body, the Highway Authorities
and Utilities Committee, has advised the government on what the CSWR should
look like.
A blueprint is now being developed for the Department of Transport (DTp) by
KPMG Management Consulting, and a contract worth about Pounds 14m will go
out to tender by the end of the year.
The CSWR offers a chance to improve the accuracy of road work information.
This should not be difficult as Puswa has been notoriously inaccurate - it
is said to have records of road works in the North Sea, for example.
Increased accuracy would mean fewer cases of contractors and utilities
damaging plant by digging holes in the wrong places. Over the last few
years, the National Joint Utilities Group (NJUG), which represents utilities
collectively, has been trying to achieve this goal through a series of
regional trials; and two of these, in Lothian, Scotland, and in Dudley, in
the West Midlands, have been useful precursors to the CSWR.
In 1982 Dudley Metropolitan Borough Council started a trail-blazing
experiment which involved utilities sharing their mains records through
centralised digital maps maintained by the council. When this system went
live in 1985, damage to plant was cut by about 50 per cent almost
immediately.
From 1987, the council decided to use its digital maps as the foundation for
a street works register which would chart the life of an excavation from the
planning stage to the final reinstatement of the road and settlement of
invoices. Holes in the road were defined by their co-ordinates on the maps
to an accuracy of within one metre. The maps now hold records of about
45,000 holes.
Dudley's system has drawn considerable international interest. However, it
is too expensive to be sustained indefinitely and now the council is about
to move to a post and fax system to comply with the new Act. The trial will
have cost Pounds 2.5m, funded jointly by British Gas, BT, Mercury
Communications, the DTp, the council, and the electricity supply and water
industries.
Another NJUG experiment managed to outlive its trial by being less ambitious
and therefore cheaper. The system, known as Susiephone, started life at
Lothian Regional Council as a message-relaying service with the slogan 'Dial
before you dig'. By making a single phone call a contractor could inform all
the utilities of an intended excavation and receive a complete picture of
underground plant.
Backed by a consortium of users including Scottish Power, British Gas
(Scotland), BT, Mercury and local cable TV companies, Susiephone soon
developed into a PC-based electronic messaging system. In addition, Lothian
developed its own 'Puswa management system' which has many of the features
of a rudimentary street works register.
Susiephone was very successful but not sophisticated enough to meet the
demands of the new Act. So the consortium returned to the drawing board and
this year announced a new version based on modern workstations from the US
company Sun Microsystems.
The new Susiephone has been aligned with the requirements of the national
CSWR. Lothian intends to use it as an interim system before the full CSWR
arrives in 1994, and the consortium has signed a Pounds 400,000 deal with
ICL which will develop the system for marketing to other UK authorities.
Although utilities doubt that it could be used as a full CSWR, it is just
possible that Susiephone could evolve into a national system. Both the
Dudley and Susiephone groups will be invited to tender for the CSWR contract
later this year.
KPMG's specification for this contract is nearly finished and some features
of the future system are beginning to emerge. A consultation paper issued to
authorities and utilities last month by the DTp recommends a single national
database built from a network of regional computers. It will support:
electronic mail for giving notice of road works;
software for co-ordinating road works;
software for handling road-work inspections (from 1996).
For improved accuracy, the CSWR will make use of a new National Street
Gazetteer which will be the first complete list of all streets in the UK.
Greater accuracy - to within metres - would be possible using digital maps.
However, a Dudley-type system covering the whole country has been dismissed
for the present. The technology is 'slightly too immature', says Richard
Goodwin, project manager at KPMG.
But Mike Bosworth, Dudley council's chief land surveyor, says the CSWR may
eventually resemble Dudley's system. 'Our concepts are sound and I think the
national system will develop into what we've got here at Dudley after 10
years,' he says.
The DTp's consultation paper suggests the CSWR will be controlled by its
users through a management board, which would appoint a computer company to
operate the network. However, authorities and utilities are still
considering forming a company in which they would be joint shareholders.
In Scotland, the home of Susiephone, the big issue is whether to have a
register separate from the rest of the UK. 'There's a fairly strong feeling
that we should have a system located in Scotland,' says Sylvia Murray,
principal policy officer with Cosla, the Scottish local authorities
association. 'But being Scots it would be hard to argue against sharing a
system based in Birmingham - if it were cheaper.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Pledge by Major on Brussels powers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CAMPAIGN to roll back 'unnecessary regulation' by Brussels was yesterday
promised by Mr John Major as he set out his priorities for Britain's
presidency of the European Community in the second half of this year.
In a speech to the Ayrshire Chamber of Commerce, the prime minister promised
to work unceasingly for a wider Europe that would embrace the emerging
democracies of eastern Europe.
His appearance in Scotland marked the first in a post-election series of
visits to fulfil a pledge to make government from Westminster less remote
from the people of Scotland.
While reiterating his promise to 'take stock' of the pressures in Scotland
for more self-government, he reaffirmed his absolute opposition to
legislative devolution. Attacking the 'narrow nationalism' of the Scottish
National party, he warned that devolution would be a 'step half-way across a
chasm'. He linked Scotland's past and future prosperity to the role that
Britain played in the EC. Separation would relegate Scotland from the heart
of Europe to, at best, its outer fringe, depriving it of investment and
influence.
Mr Major, who used a trip to central Europe last to back the claims of
Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary for EC membership, said that a wider
Europe was vital to the peace and prosperity of Europe. 'It is not an
optional extra.'
He insisted that the government would not be content with arguing its corner
defensively in the Community but would set out its own vision of the future.
Britain would take as its starting point that the cardinal principle of the
Community must be the free market. It would use its presidency to ensure
that the single market was completed and then move on to try to limit the
burdens the EC placed on business.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Solicitors face levy to meet sharp rise in fraud claims
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE, Legal Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOLICITORS IN England and Wales face a special levy of more than Pounds
1,000 this autumn on top of their annual insurance premiums to meet a big
increase in professional fraud claims. The Law Society, the solicitors'
governing body, also proposes tough restrictions on the right of solicitors
to practise on their own.
Dishonest sole practitioners are largely responsible for the rise in
payments made by the profession's compensation fund from Pounds 11.7m last
year to an estimated Pounds 20m this year.
Much of the increase in claims stems from the increase in mortgage fraud
involving solicitors. The Metropolitan Police have put the value of mortgage
fraud involving solicitors at more than Pounds 1bn. The society disputes
that figure.
The compensation fund was set up by the society to meet claims - not covered
by professional indemnity insurance - that result from the dishonest conduct
of sole practitioners and cases where all partners of a firm have been
dishonest. The profession already has to raise Pounds 178m this year for the
solicitors' indemnity fund.
To meet the growing cost of dishonest solicitors, the society is proposing
to raise Pounds 50m for the fund this year. Solicitors who hold clients'
money - partners - will each have to pay at least Pounds 1,591 made up of an
annual contribution of Pounds 600 plus a special levy when they renew their
practising certificates this autumn.
Contributions to the indemnity fund will also rise significantly in the
autumn. The contributions of sole practitioners will rise by 31 per cent and
those of two-partner and three-partner firms by 18 per cent, while the
contributions of most larger firms will remain the same.
Sole practitioners will in future face bi-annual accounts checks by the
society and restrictions on their right to handle clients' money.
The society will also vote later this week on whether to cap payments out of
the compensation fund at Pounds 50,000. The society is not keen to cap the
fund in relation to private clients, as it feels that would be a
public-relations disaster. It is considering a cap on payments to banks and
building societies arising out of dishonest conduct by solicitors, on the
ground that institutions should be more aware than individuals of the risks
involved.

FT  02 JUN 92 / BR to introduce station nurseries
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMMUTERS will soon be able to park their children as well as their cars at
10 stations on British Rail's Network SouthEast.
Just over half the places at the nurseries, paid for by BR and local
employers, will be reserved for BR staff, but they will also be open to
passengers. The first two, at Oxford and Wimbledon - purpose-built at a
combined cost of Pounds 500,000 - are likely to open in July and provide a
total of 100 places.
BR says many more such creches might open around the country if the scheme
is successful. Network SouthEast hopes to open a further eight during the
next school year.
BR hopes the nurseries will help in retaining women workers, cut absenteeism
and increase efficiency.
The number of employer-sponsored nurseries has doubled to 425 since the 1990
Budget introduced tax incentives.
The BR move comes after Midland Bank's decision to end its creche programme
last year. The bank had planned to open 300 nurseries by 1993, but stopped
at 130.
Last year a survey showed that, of 34 companies that had been planning
nursery provision in 1989, only seven had started to operate creches.
The BR nurseries will be run by independent companies and based on US
railway creches.
The 10 nurseries will be spread throughout the south-east region, almost
certainly at sites that will serve each of the nine divisions of Network
SouthEast. An additional London-based nursery is likely.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Election boost for unit trusts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE general election result and new tax incentives led to the highest sales
of unit trusts for 12 months, according to figures released today by the
Unit Trust Association, John Authers writes.
Total sales in April were Pounds 1bn, while the total number of unit trust
accounts held rose for the first time since June 1990. Net sales, at Pounds
252.6m, were greater than for the entire first quarter, and reached their
highest level since last September.
Funds under management grew to Pounds 59.36bn, the highest figure since
October, up from Pounds 55.98bn in March. This was also aided by the strong
stock market performance in the weeks after the election.
Increased tax concessions announced in the Budget for unit trust investment
via Personal Equity Plans (Peps) also encouraged smaller investors into the
market.
Mr Norman Lamont increased the amount that can be invested annually in unit
trust Peps from Pounds 3,000 to Pounds 6,000.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Customers 'ignorant' of water penalties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST customers of water companies in England and Wales do not realise they
are entitled to compensation if certain guaranteed service standards are not
met, according to a survey.
That can arise when it takes longer to restore a water supply than the
customer has been warned; where there are supply interruptions of more than
a set time; when an appointment on a day promised in writing is not kept; or
when there is no answer to a complaint or inquiry within a specified time.
Customers can claim a Pounds 5 cash payment or credit for each infringement.
The survey is the first commissioned by the Office of Water Services
(Ofwat), the industry's economic regulator, to discover what customers think
about the standard of water and sewerage services and their priorities for
improvements.
Nearly a quarter of the 3,617 people surveyed by Mori between November last
year and January 1992, thought water charges were 'fairly unreasonable' and
15 per cent thought their bills were 'very unreasonable'.
Half thought the price they paid for water was reasonable, but more than
three quarters were satisfied with the overall service.
The findings come at a time of steep rises in water charges. Bills in
England and Wales are due to rise in the next few years by an average of 5
percentage points above the level of inflation to pay for the industry's
Pounds 28bn capital expenditure programme. The average rise this year is 9.3
per cent.
Mr Ian Byatt, director-general of Ofwat, said it was important to know the
opinions of the industry's customers, and the survey indicated where their
priorities lay.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Business school director resigns
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Tom Cannon resigned yesterday as director of Manchester Business
School, clearing the way for controversial plans by Manchester University to
change the structure of management research and education in the city.
The plans have already caused 14 private-sector representatives to resign
from the business school's council. They demanded an inquiry by Mr John
Patten, the education secretary. With Prof Cannon no longer available to
lead the school's fight for greater autonomy from the university, Mr Patten
is thought unlikely to intervene.
Prof Cannon and the university yesterday agreed a statement to reduce the
blow to the university's prestige caused by the high-level resignations -
which were led by Sir Dennis Landau, chief executive of the Co-operative
Wholesale Society.
Prof Cannon, who had two years of his contract still to run, said a recent
sabbatical had given him the chance to look into new areas of research which
he would now pursue. The university appointed him to a part-time visiting
chair in corporate responsibility.
The university plans to federate the management education and research
activities of the business school, the University of Manchester Institute of
Science and Technology (Umist) and the university's department of
accounting. They have sofar operated separately.
Prof Cannon said a new ordinance brought in by the university to regularise
financial accountability would alter the remit of the school's director and
its council.
The ordinance will in effect remove the business school's autonomy and
abolish its council. The council's 14 lay members, who resigned, say the
university does not understand the relationship needed between the public
and private sectors in management education, which requires more autonomy
from the university, not less.
The university admitted in the joint statement with Prof Cannon that its
relations with the business school have been difficult for many years - and
well before Prof Cannon's arrival in 1989. It says they were forced into new
prominence by the Education Reform Act, which required the university to
define clearer lines of financial accountability.
In what amounts to a public testimonial for Prof Cannon, the university says
he doubled the size of the school, attracted record numbers of postgraduate
students, improved the quality of its research, enhanced its academic
reputation and achieved two years of record profits.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Lamont defies EC demands on VAT
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH, European Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR NORMAN LAMONT, the chancellor, came under strong pressure from the
European Commission yesterday to abandon Britain's policy of refusing to
accept legally binding minimum rates of value added tax throughout the EC.
The Treasury signalled that it would be prepared to face a clash with the
Commission over the issue.
Mrs Christiane Scrivener, EC commissioner responsible for fiscal policy,
warned that Britain would face a 'hard time' unless it agreed a compromise
with its EC partners before the end of this month.
She was speaking after meeting Mr Lamont in London about preparations for
the next EC finance ministers' meeting to be held in a week's time. Mr
Lamont used yesterday's talks to reaffirm Britain's firm line not only on
VAT but also on excise duties on spirits sold throughout the EC.
The UK wants to protect the Scotch whisky industry from possible increased
duties in some EC states under plans to harmonise indirect taxes.
Underlining a toughening of the sparring over indirect taxation, Mrs
Scrivener hinted that Britain might put into jeopardy its hard-won right to
maintain zero VAT on a range of everyday goods unless it backed down over
the minimum rates question. 'We want the UK to realise that the situation is
very serious,' she said.
The Treasury flatly contradicted Mrs Scrivener's implicit threat that the
zero-rate exemption might be at risk. Britain's zero VAT rates were
guaranteed under the EC's sixth VAT directive, which could be changed only
by unanimous decision of finance ministers, the Treasury said.
The VAT tussle goes to the heart of Britain's desire to maintain maximum
fiscal policy freedom in spite of growing economic integration. Mrs
Scrivener said she was hopeful that a solution could be found before Britain
took over the Community presidency in a month's time.
Britain has agreed Commission plans for a Community-wide minimum VAT level
of 15 per cent, to come into effect on January 1 next year with the
establishment of the single market. But the UK has refused to enshrine the
measure in a legally binding EC directive, on the ground that it would
restrict the Treasury's freedom of manoeuvre.
Mrs Scrivener said that other EC countries that had already decided to align
their national VAT rates with the new rules were growing increasingly angry
about Britain's VAT obduracy.

a subcommittee that sifts names and forwards them to a central honours pool
run by the Cabinet Office. Names are then passed to 10 Downing Street and
eventually to Buckingham Palace.
THE QUEEN: has her own list for the Order of Merit and for some orders of
chivalry.
POLITICAL PARTIES: the principal route is through the whips' offices.
Conservative Central Office feeds candidates to the chief whip - one of
whose titles is patronage secretary - and after sifting they go to the
Cabinet Office and on to 10 Downing Street. Nominations from opposition
parties go the same way.
THE PRIME MINISTER: can add or subtract from the lists the Civil Service
supplies, and it is at that stage that glamour names, such as pop and sports
stars, are added.

FT  02 JUN 92 / PM sustains orders of vanished empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS, RICHARD DONKIN, JIMMY BURNS and ANDREW SLADE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR'S dissol-ution honours on Saturday and the Queen's birthday
honours list a week later will be trawled minutely for any hint they may
give of the prime minister's intention to overhaul the complex and
cumbersome honours system.
The honours system is often defended as harmless and inexpensive fun, which
occasionally rewards the outstanding and frequently the dull but worthy.
Critics say the system represents Britain at its worst - snobbish, secretive
and backward-looking - and that nothing illustrates its absurdity better
than the titles awarded of commander, officer and member of orders in a
non-existent empire.
Nearly every state awards honours of some kind, but Britain is the only
country to give honours that involve the recipients' changing their names or
taking a parliamentary seat unelected.
Similarly, only Britain has evolved a system of such arcane complexity that
only a handful of senior civil servants, and presumably the Queen, fully
understand its fine distinctions.
Any shivers of apprehension in Whitehall and the Conservative party that
imminent reforms might damage cherished expectations are likely to be
premature - both the lists to be published this month promise to be solidly
mainstream and traditional.
Many hurdles have to be overcome before reforms are introduced, and the
question remains whether the meritocratic Mr Major can overcome the support
for the system in the Civil Service and in the government, where patronage
can be a formidable weapon.
How would potential rebels be kept in order if government whips could not
rely on honours for the subservient and hints about life peerages to
discipline troublemakers? And how would party coffers be filled?
At least twice annually - with the new-year and the Queen's birthday lists -
and more frequently in years when parliament is dissolved or a prime
minister resigns - public worries about patronage are aired, then shelved.
Mr Major has now to show he can disrupt this pattern.
There are three areas Mr Major will have to reform if he is to meet the main
criticisms - the way decisions are reached, which is regarded as too
secretive; the ending of automatic honours; and the abolition of political
honours.
Although recipients are researched scrupulously, the secrecy means there is
often no clear rationale behind decisions, and that leads to suspicions. For
example, the relationship between businessmen who give large sums of money
to the Conservative party and those who have received high political honours
is close.
During Mrs Thatcher's 11 years as prime minister, 17 private-sector
industrialists were made peers - their companies had contributed more than
Pounds 5m to the Tory party or a linked organisation.
As Mr John Walker says in his book The Queen Has Been Pleased, that works
out at Pounds 300,000 a peerage. He estimates that a senior industrialist
doubled his chance of getting a peerage or knighthood after 1979 if his
company donated to Tory funds.
After the Lloyd George sale of honours in 1920, when the price of a peerage
was about Pounds 100,000 (more than Pounds 1m at today's prices), a
political honours scrutiny committee of three privy councillors was created
to ensure that there was no further scandal.
Mr Major is clearly against the award of automatic honours to civil servants
and others simply because of seniority. The practice was introduced to
reward poorly paid public servants, but pay is no longer poor in the higher
reaches of the Civil Service.
The awarding of automatic honours is less clear-cut outside the Civil
Service. The heads of the Stock Exchange and the Securities and Investments
Board, for example, can count on knighthoods, but one is not always bestowed
on the chairman of the Lloyd's of London insurance market.
Chairmen of the four clearing banks are virtually assured of a title, and
the governor and his deputy at the Bank of England are also certain of
honours.
So-called political honours were abandoned by Lord (Harold) Wilson when he
was prime minister in 1966 and were not used by Sir Edward Heath, his
successor, to reward loyal and long-serving backbenchers. The tradition was
revived by Mrs Margaret Thatcher and more than 100 knighthoods were given to
Tory MPs during her premiership.
Probably the worst job to have for anyone wanting to attract an honour is
that of a profession is usually well represented in the lists, the world of
entertainment is rarely recognised. Stars such as Benny Hill, Dick Emery and
Tommy Cooper received no recognition, although they provided big export
earnings through films and television series.
There also seems to be some distinction in sporting honours. Cricket, rugby
union and show jumping get proportionately many more honours than soccer,
rugby league or snooker.
Support for reform is widespread. Lord Hunt, a life peer and former
secretary to the cabinet in the Callaghan and Thatcher administrations, said
the system worked surprisingly well in identifying people who were not part
of the establishment. 'But the idea that people should get honours simply
because they have reached a certain level in the Civil Service is wrong.'
What is not clear from Mr Major's hints of reform is the timing, and the
signs are that nothing is imminent.
It will depend on his judgment on whether the political dividend of radical
change is seen to outweigh the aggravation caused within the government and
in Whitehall.

NORTHERN Ireland's political leaders agreed yesterday to spend a further two
days trying to resolve a row over the timing of the Irish government's entry
into the talks.
There was little evidence that intensive talks in a sub-committee over the
past few days had made significant progress towards resolving the deadlock.
Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, may decide to suspend the
process, or he may announce unilaterally when the Irish government will
enter.
Yesterday, Sir Patrick and Mr Jeremy Hanley, the minister responsible for
political development in the province, had talks with the party leaders
before to a full plenary session.
The Northern Ireland Office said it had been agreed that the sub-committee
would continue to try to move the process forward before reporting back
tomorrow.
All parties were yesterday maintaining their pledge of confidentiality.

THE COUNCIL of the Lloyd's of London insurance market will consider a
proposal to help some of the worst-affected Names at its monthly meeting
tomorrow.
However, Lloyd's said yesterday that there was no certainty that it would
adopt any plan. An ad hoc committee has been considering possible schemes
for several weeks. The adoption of any plan is likely to depend on the
approval in a ballot of the market's 22,400 Names - wealthy individuals
whose capital backs the market.
The Names may have to meet much of the cost of any scheme through a special
levy. Although most agencies - which manage syndicates and handle the
affairs of Names - favour a bail-out plan, many of the Names are less
enthusiastic.

FT  02 JUN 92 / BSkyB and BBC confirm FA deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Sky Broadcasting, the satellite television venture, and the BBC
yesterday agreed a Pounds 75m deal with the Football Association for
coverage of FA Cup matches and England's home internationals, Raymond Snoddy
writes.
The two broadcasting organisation are three years into a Pounds 30m
four-year agreement with the FA. Yesterday's deal is for a further four
years.
The agreement yesterday follows the Pounds 304m deal last month between
BSkyB, in which Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake, and the
BBC for five years' coverage of the new Premier League's matches.
The BBC will continue to have access under the agreement to one live game
for each round of the Cup as well as the semi-finals and the final.
BSkyB will have rights to one live game and one recorded game from each
round and exclusive coverage of any semi-final replays.
The deal is likely to arouse more anger from ITV, which says its bid for the
BBC package alone was close to the combined BSkyB-BBC total.
ITV is now left with an Pounds 8m-a-year agreement to cover the Football
League, without the Premier League or the Rumbelows Cup.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Big double-glazing company fails: MP demands rapid inquiry
by official receiver 'to ensure there has been no malpractice'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DOUBLE-GLAZING com-pany started by founders of the collapsed Stormseal
group has failed after less than 15 months. Northern Stock Plastics, which
traded as Surestyle, was started with the assets of the Stormseal group. It
has called in receivers, with a threat to about 500 jobs.
Mr Mark Palios of Cork Gully, the receiver, said last night he hoped to have
a preliminary estimate of Surestyle's debts today.
Stormseal failed in January last year owing about Pounds 20m to unsecured
creditors, including Pounds 500,000 to leading players in a snooker
tournament it was sponsoring.
Exact figures have not yet been calculated by Grant Thornton, Stormseal's
receiver, and the inquiry has not yet been completed. More than 3,000 jobs
were lost or affected.
Stormseal and Surestyle were both founded by brothers Michael and Mark
Sweeney, of Bury, Greater Manchester, where both businesses were based. The
companies both used nationwide sales staffs paid on commission.
High-pressure methods used by some of their salesmen had attracted
criticism.
The Sweeneys formed Surestyle as a 'phoenix' company after buying the
Stormseal businesses from the receiver for Pounds 3m in February 1991.
Mr Alastair Burt, Conservative MP for Bury North, last night called for a
speedy inquiry by the official receiver 'to ensure there has been no
malpractice'.
He has written to Mr Neil Hamilton, trade and industry minister, about the
time taken to complete the Stormseal inquiry. As a minister - in the social
security department - he is limited in what he can say in public on
constituency-related matters.
Concern is understood to be increasing at Westminster about 'phoenix'
companies - failed companies restarted by people who ran them before their
collapse. Limited liability enables directors to leave the trading debts of
a failed company behind and start afresh in the same business.
There is no suggestion that the Sweeneys have done anything improper - they
had to compete to buy Stormseal's assets. Some MPs, though, are asking
whether people involved in a business failure should first be cleared by the
receiver in order to start a phoenix operation with the same assets.
Mr Michael Sweeney yesterday blamed Surestyle's collapse on the recession
and 'unwarranted' bad publicity. He said that in having a second go at the
business he and his brother had been trying to save jobs.
Earlier this year a Teesside lecturer called on police to remove two
Surestyle salesmen who refused to leave his home without a sales order.
Surestyle later sacked them.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BANK of England warned banks yesterday of the dangers of buying a
foreign bank or trying to develop into pan-European institutions.
The management and cultural impediments of adopting either strategy 'appear
to be overly daunting', Mr Brian Quinn, the Bank's director in charge of
supervision, told chairmen of the world's biggest banks at the International
Monetary Conference in Toronto.
This year's conference chairman is Mr William Purves, chairman of Hongkong
and Shanghai Banking Corporation, the Far Eastern bank that is trying to buy
Midland Bank of the UK.
Mr Quinn said cross-border deals similar to that proposed by Hongkong Bank
would remain few and far between.
He said it was 'unlikely that we will see any pan-European retail or
wholesale bank or securities company established in the near future'.
Mr Quinn pointed out that banks of different nationalities were tending to
form looser alliances, such as sharing businesses. Some were taking minority
shareholdings in each other or being jointly represented in some countries.
He was sceptical about the benefits of such alliances. 'They appear to owe
more to defensive or protective sentiments than to a clearly articulated
strategy,' he said.
Big US banks were encouraged by a speech from Mr Nicholas Brady, the US
Secretary of the Treasury, in which he made a commitment to revive the White
House attempts to reform the US banking system. 'Banks should be permitted
to branch nationwide, diversifying their risk and increasing the competition
in service.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Union chief warns on Labour party funding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TOM SAWYER, deputy general secretary of the Nupe public-service union and
a strong influence in the labour movement, warned yesterday that unions
would be unwilling to provide funds for the Labour party if they had no say
in its policy.
Defending the unions' links with Labour, Mr Sawyer said there was a case for
modernising the relationship and for unions not casting block votes on
behalf of anonymous members.
He cautioned: 'People who fund the party must have a say. While we fund the
party we will have a say. It is as crude as that.'
Mr Sawyer's comments - he even advocated retaining the electoral college for
electing the leader - amount to a further blow to supporters of
root-and-branch reform of the party-union link. They appeared to make the
running in the immediate post-election period.
His comments come a week after Labour's national executive committee set in
motion an inquiry into the relationship with unions. It was Mr Sawyer, an
NEC member and last year's party chairman, who proposed the inquiry.
The executive of Nupe, the fourth-largest union affiliated to Labour, said
in a statement yesterday that it rejected any notion that the union-party
links should be broken. In a speech to the union's annual conference in
Scarborough, Mr Sawyer criticised party members who sought to make the
unions a scapegoat for the Conservatives' election victory.
'Don't blame the unions,' he said. 'And don't blame the staff or the party's
advisers. If the campaign wasn't good enough, it was the politicians who
were in charge of the campaign that failed.'
Mr Sawyer also criticised fellow union leaders and others who began
advocating a diminution of union influence immediately after the election.
'Too many who should know better are saying too many things about the
election and the future of the Labour party without thinking.'
Later, Mr Sawyer said: 'We are in danger of losing the collective approach
of unions in policy-making structures.'
The basis of the inquiry should be to safeguard the rights of the people who
fund the Labour party. The electoral college that chooses who should be
Labour party leader should stay, although it should be democratised, he
said.
That may put him at odds with Mr John Smith, likely to be the next Labour
party leader, who has said that he wants future leadership contests to be
decided on the basis of one-person-one-vote.
Mr Sawyer said he would favour calls for an examination into the separating
of union block votes so that the preferences of individual members could be
reflected. Under the present system, each union casts all of its votes for
one candidate or another.
Mr Sawyer said unions should also maintain a presence on the national
executive committee. They gave 'balance, breadth and working-class
representation.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Concern at 'fragility' of training policy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER evidence of govern-ment concern at the 'fragility' of its training
policy is disclosed in a strategy paper by Sir Geoffrey Holland, permanent
secretary at the Department of Employment.
He says the 'initial enthusiasm' of the 82 Training and Enterprise Councils
in England and Wales has been 'dented' and adds that not all Tecs are fully
effective. The main anxiety mentioned in the paper is the ability of Tecs to
work with the education service and meet the government's targets for skill
levels among young people. 'There is a big (but declining) gap between the
achievements of young people and the target achievement,' the paper adds.
Sir Geoffrey says that a shortage of resources has prevented Tecs from
playing a full part in stimulating growth in the Investors In People scheme.
'We need to address ourselves to how to transform IIP into the flagship it
ought to be - and must be if we are to succeed,' he writes.
On an institutional level the paper states: 'Tecs clearly need to develop
rapidly and professionally their partnership with education . . . Few have
made much progress in this area.'
Sir Geoffrey also highlights the tension between meeting government training
guarantees for the unemployed and achieving training targets for those in
work. That has been echoed by many Tec chairmen, some of whom would like the
freedom to transfer resources from the large schemes for the unemployed -
Youth Training and Employment Training - to other training initiatives.
Mr Tony Blair, shadow employment secretary, called for a thorough
stocktaking of the success and failure of the Tec experiment but expressed
opposition to any move to shift resources away from training the unemployed.

THE MAIN union in BT, the telecommunications group, has voted not to
co-operate with a scheme for redundant workers that would guarantee them
three months' work after leaving the company.
The annual conference of the NCU communications union voted to reject the
scheme, fearing that it would lead to increased casual employment.
BT hopes for 24,000 redundancies this year. Its scheme would provide leavers
with a Pounds 1,000 training voucher and at least three months' work in the
year after redundancy. The work would be arranged through Manpower and
Skillbase employment agencies.
BT says that although the idea of 'bridging' work before retirement or
another job is not new, it has never been tried on such a scale for
non-managerial staff. Those on the scheme would be employed by the agencies
and receive at least 25 per cent of their last BT salary for the three
months' work.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Lenders will defend record
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CHIEF executives of the top 10 UK mortgage lenders will today try to
persuade ministers that they have managed to prevent evictions of thousands
of homeowners unable to maintain mortgage payments. The Pounds 800m mortgage
rescue programme announced last December has nevertheless so far failed to
get off the ground.
At the meeting will be Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor, Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, and Sir George Young, housing minister. They will tell
lenders of their disappointment that only a dozen households seem to have
been spared eviction by the mortgage rescue schemes agreed between lenders
and the government.
Lenders say legal and commercial snags have delayed full operation of the
schemes, but that they have saved tens of thousands of homeowners from
eviction by negotiating easier terms.
About 275,000 mortgage borrowers were six months or more behind with
payments at the start of the year, but evictions by the end of the year are
likely to be close to last year's 76,000. That suggests that lenders have
found ways of saving about 200,000 homeowners.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PAY RESTRAINT is vital if Britain is to maintain its competitive position,
Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and industry secretary, warned yesterday, Emma
Tucker writes.
In a speech attacking manufacturing wage rises for running at twice the rate
of inflation, Mr Heseltine said lower pay settlements were vital if Britain
was to 'build on the increase in competitiveness which we achieved in the
1980s'.
He complained that manufacturing earnings were rising by an average of 8 per
cent, almost double the inflation rate.
'Compared to the UK's 8 per cent, the increase in earnings in manufacturing
in Germany last year was 6 per cent, in Japan 4 per cent and in the US just
3 per cent,' Mr Heseltine said at a London conference of business leaders.
The Department of Employment says average earnings for the whole economy are
still running at an annual rate of 7.5 per cent even though the level of pay
deals has fallen significantly since last year.
Economists expect the rate of average earnings to drop over the next few
months as the high pay settlements of a year ago - when the inflation rate
was above 6 per cent - drop out of the index.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Gas-fired power stations criticised
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Grid Company may refuse to take power from many of the new
gas-fired power stations being built in England and Wales because of fears
about the design of the stations, it said yesterday.
National Grid, which owns and operates the electricity supply system, was
responding to a statement from Mr Malcolm Edwards, former commercial
director of British Coal. He said the new stations would be technically
inferior to existing coal-fired stations.
This will intensify the row over whether the 16 new stations now committed
or being built were necessary. National Grid has warned that they would
create a 60 per cent surplus of electricity by 1997.
Mr Edwards said the new gas stations were less flexible than coal-fired
stations and could not guarantee the stability of the system.
He said those shortcomings arose from National Grid's failure to communicate
the requirements for the design of the gas-powered stations to developers.
That was supported by the contradictory comments from National Grid and
developers of the new stations, he said.
However, Mr Bryan Townsend, chairman of Midlands Electricity, rejected the
claim. 'It's absolute rubbish,' he said. Midlands Electricity is involved in
the biggest power station project on Teeside.
Mr Townsend said that all new stations had been designed to meet
requirements set out by National Grid in its grid code. 'If a plant is
designed to meet the grid code, it won't have problems.'
Mr Mike Eggleton of Yorkshire Electricity defended the new stations. 'Many
of the new gas plant designs are more flexible than the large coal
stations,' he said. Yorkshire Electricity is building a power station in
south Humberside.
National Grid said it was concerned that some of the gas-fired stations
might not meet the system's requirements, even though they met the grid code
specifications. That was because the code left room for interpretation and
did not specify how flexible a new plant had to be.
Mr Edwards predicted that National Grid would not be able to take more than
half of the total power that all the new stations being built or committed
would provide when demand was low without jeopardising the supply.
That was good news for coal, he said. Even if gas were cheaper, it might
replace the power generated by only about 20m tonnes of coal, rather than
the 30m previously expected.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STOCKBROKER falsely told Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank, in October
1990 that Maxwell Communication Corporation was about to file for
bankruptcy, it was alleged at Knightsbridge Crown Court yesterday.
Mr Andrew Collins QC, prosecuting, said Mr Peter Marks, a director of
Branston and Gothard, made the statement, which he had known was untrue, to
try to lower the MCC share price and make money for himself on dealings in
the shares.
Mr Marks has pleaded not guilty to a charge under section 47 of the
Financial Services Act of making a misleading, false or deceptive statement
to induce share dealing.
Mr Collins said that soon after 8am on October 12 Mr Marks telephoned Mr
Graham Ward, a Goldman Sachs marketmaker in London, and agreed to sell him
100,000 MCC shares at 136p.
Three minutes later Mr Marks rang again and asked Mr Ward to call him back
on a line on which calls were not tape-recorded.
The return call was made by Mr Ward's superior, Mr Timothy Medland, whose
recollection was that Mr Marks had told him that Mr Robert Maxwell would be
filing for bankruptcy for MCC that day, or words to that effect.
Mr Collins said: 'What was conveyed was a statement of fact that Maxwell was
effectively going bust that day.' Shortly afterwards Mr Marks again
telephoned Mr Ward and agreed to sell him a further 100,000 MCC shares at
133p.
Mr Marks then bought 200,000 MCC shares at 134p to fulfil the sales.
Mr Collins said Goldman Sachs had been one of the main buyers of Maxwell
shares. If it had suddenly marked them down the price might have been
expected to fall.
Mr Ward said that in September and October 1990 Goldman Sachs had in general
been buying, and as the MCC price had gone down Mr Ward had bought the stock
on the instructions of a Goldman Sachs partner in New York.
Cross-examined by Mr Anthony Scrivener QC, for Mr Marks, Mr Ward agreed that
on October 12 Goldman Sachs had held 23,433,708 MCC shares and that dealing
records appeared to show that on that day 1m MCC shares had been sold within
Goldman Sachs.
Mr Collins intervened to say the 1m shares had been sold to Goldman Sachs
New York.
Mr Medland said he had passed on what Mr Marks had told him to Mr Eric
Sheinberg, Goldman Sachs managing director in New York.
Mr Scrivener suggested to Mr Medland, now a stocktrader with Swiss Bank
Corporation, that Goldman Sachs had 'a special relationship' with the
Maxwell organisation.
Mr Medland agreed. He said Mr Sheinberg had been the only person with
authority over a special Maxwell share account.
The trial continues today.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Chambers offered single roof: Moves to merge two business
organisations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE brink of the 21st century, the business organisations that have
represented British companies since the end of the 19th are belatedly
bringing themselves up to date.
Plans for a merger between the Association of British Chambers of Commerce -
founded in 1860 - and the National Chamber of Trade - established in 1895 -
mark an important step towards consolidating the voice of smaller
businesses. Their fragmented lobbying efforts have frequently been blamed
for their ineffectiveness in influencing government policy.
A merger would also represent an important boost to plans launched by the
association just over 18 months ago to strengthen the chamber of commerce
network. By linking with the NCT, which mainly represents retailers, the
association would enhance its role as one of the country's big three
national business groups, second to the Confederation of British Industry
with 250,000 members and ahead of the Institute of Directors with 33,500 UK
members.
If the merger - in effect a takeover by the association of the less
financially well endowed NCT - goes ahead in the autumn, it will end the
confusion of two very similarly named organisations competing for public
attention and for members in towns and cities up and down the country.
The NCT draws a large chunk of its membership from 28 affiliated trade
organisations representing among others booksellers, coal merchants and
sports goods distributors. It also has 150 chambers around the country.
The association heads a group of more than 100 chambers but is trying to
improve patchy national coverage by creating a network of 55 core chambers.
Around those will cluster smaller local chambers, some of them no more than
social clubs.
For the NCT, difficulties are even more acute. Average membership of local
chambers of trade is 60 people. Even the largest six chambers of trade in
towns such as Sheffield, Carlisle and Eastbourne have only 400 to 500
members. That compares with the larger chambers of commerce in London and
Birmingham with 5,000 and 5,400 members respectively - although even those
are tiny compared with the large, publicly funded Continental chambers. None
of the chambers of trade is expected to have the resources to join the the
association's core network.
Both the association and the NCT have to cope with unaffiliated chambers
that use the chamber title but are outside national membership for financial
reasons or because they have fallen out with the national body.
Although at first sight the addition of 150,000 new members to the
association would be welcome to an organisation in the middle of a national
recruitment drive to boost numbers from 83,000 to 150,000, many of the new
members would be one-person businesses and corner shops. They do not conform
to the association's target of dynamic businesses set on growth.
They would, however, be welcome at a time when the association's own
expansion programme has run up against the recession. With the impact of its
recruitment drive yet to show through, the association is nursing a 7,000
loss in membership over the past two years.
The association and the NCT have been trying for many years to merge. The
two most recent attempts, in 1984 and 1986-87, failed because of differences
of opinion about the relative weight of the two organisations in the
combined group.
So why do they now think they can get together? Mr Bernard Tennant, NCT
director-general, believes it is because the association wants to fill an
important gap in its coverage of UK industry sectors, namely retailing.
The NCT is willing to accept a subordinate role as a retailing and small
firms division of the association, prompted possibly by the sharp
contraction in the number of smaller retailers in recent years - although
not in its membership - and by financial constraints.
The NCT still has a strong balance sheet but has made operating losses in
the past two years because of a reluctance by member chambers to raise
subscription rates.
The association's reorganisation is being led by Mr Ron Taylor, a former
head of Leeds chamber of commerce and the organisation's first
director-general in living memory to have a chamber rather than a Civil
Service background.
Mr Tennant is a long-term member of the NCT's headquarters staff, who became
director-general in 1987. The two men have known each other since the 1960s,
when Mr Tennant also worked for the chambers of commerce.
He later headed Bolton's chamber of trade, which, wealthier than the local
chamber of commerce, invited the latter to take office space in its new
headquarters. As the terms of the proposed merger suggest, that power
relationship has changed.

BRATISLAVA, capital of the Slovak republic, has awarded a FFr3bn (Pounds
300m) contract to a consortium of two French companies and local partners to
build a driverless commuter railway for the city, William Dawkins reports
from Paris.
Matra, the French transport and defence electronics group, will supply its
Vehicule Automatic Leger (Val) system, first installed in Lille in 1983. Val
has since been sold to Paris, for a link opened last year between Orly
airport and the nearest regional rail station. A Val line is in use in
Jacksonville, Florida, with others being built in Toulouse, Chicago and
Taipei.
Work on the Bratislava line starts at the end of this year and will be
handled by a Franco-Slovak group led by Campenon Bernard, the French
engineering company. Some 300 Slovak contractors will perform some 40 per
cent of the work, including building and power supply.
The 7.5km line, the first French infrastructure project in eastern Europe,
will run under the Danube to link the two halves of the city, carrying
17,000 passengers an hour each way.

FT  02 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Eurofer concerned at steel from E Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROFER, the European group of steel producers, yesterday told the European
Commission it was worried about rising steel imports from eastern Europe,
particularly Czechoslovakia.
Czechoslovak steel shipments rose 126 per cent in the first third of this
year, against the same period of 1991, a Eurofer official claimed. Eurofer
yesterday discussed with Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external affairs
commissioner, the lack of a new Gatt steel code which has prompted two US
complaints of dumping against EC exporters.
The Commission says it will try to use the conciliation mechanism of the
EC's new association agreement with Czechoslovakia before launching any
investigation. Earlier this month, Czechoslovakia conceded that the removal
of all EC quotas and virtually all tariffs on March 1 had led to a surge in
its steel exports, and promised to try to re-target these away from Germany,
Italy and Greece, which had taken most of the impact.
Czechoslovak diplomats in Brussels say they have been trying to persuade
companies to use tariff cuts to increase their profit margin, rather than
sell at lower prices and increase market share. The Czech steel issue is one
of many tensions likely to arise in the wake of the EC's new trade pacts
also covering Poland and Hungary.
The Commission yesterday published a report on its anti-dumping activities
in 1991, showing investigations opened during the year fell to 20 from a
record 43 opened in 1990. But the rate of new investigations has picked up
this year.
The EC executive maintains that, in launching these investigations, it
responds mainly to what it sees as unfair trading practices abroad, rather
than protectionist pressures at home. Thus, 11 of the 33 investigations
concluded last year were dropped, 19 ended in duties, and in three, foreign
companies agreed to raise prices. One of the year's biggest cases ended in
Japanese exporters of DRAM and EPROM computer chips being hit with a 94 per
cent duty and undertaking to obey a reference price. At the time, the
Commission was criticised for putting chip-users in the EC at a
disadvantage.
EC External Relations Commissioner Frans Andriessen urged Seoul yesterday to
stamp out discriminatory taxes on imported liquor, Reuter reports from
Brussels.  'We are unhappy about the matter and would like to see this
corrected,' his spokesman said. Mr Andriessen had raised the issue with
South Korea's Deputy Foreign Minister Kak-Kyu Choi, but received no
guarantees the system would be changed.

FT  02 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Western donors urged to ease aid
conditions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN donors seeking to encourage private investment in east Europe and
ease transition to market-oriented democracies should relax aid conditions
and streamline disbursements, says a report* on aid to central Europe by the
New York and Prague-based Institute for East-West Studies.
Aid commitment figures were often misleading. This was highlighted at a
recent EC-sponsored conference on aid to the former Soviet Union. The EC
estimated western donors had pledged Dollars 86bn (Pounds 48.5bn) to former
Soviet republics, but only part has been disbursed.
Group of 24 nations have pledged Dollars 27bn to central Europe but only 2
per cent of Czechoslovakia's share was disbursed in 1990; Hungary received
17 per cent, and Poland 27 per cent.
Such gaps are partly because most aid was not available for discretionary
spending or activated only when recipients met contractual obligations. Over
SDR1.1bn set aside in 1990 to compensate for higher oil prices was not fully
used because expected trigger prices were not maintained.
Figures quoted for aid generally refer to pledges over the life of projects,
often running several years. Credits or grants are often used to encourage
companies or non-profit bodies to invest or provide services, but where
recipients gain only a part of donors' spending. Except the EC's PHARE
technical aid programme and UN funded programmes, credits were usually
offered on commercial terms, ensuring many credit lines stay under-utilised.
It was often impossible to distinguish between components of an aid package,
but in most cases the concessional element was below the 25 per cent
required to qualify technically as 'aid'.
Slow disbursement of foreign aid was also a function of the low absorption
capacity of countries with fledgling banking and credit systems and
inexperienced, if fast-growing, private sectors.
The report urges a more flexible approach to debt management, better aid
co-ordination and more technical assistance to increase aid absorption.
'Conditionality should be re-defined in the light of recipient governments'
commitment to political and market-oriented reforms if a deep financial
crisis of a Latin American type is to be avoided.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Cartels prove a hard nut for Japan to
crack - Anti-monopoly body meets its match in construction sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN the investigators from the Fair Trade Commission (FTC) raided Japan's
leading construction companies last year, there was a collective disbelief
that the commission would dare to dismantle the cosy relationships in the
country's most politically-influential industry.
But, a week ago, when the commission decided not to prosecute 66
construction companies for the self-confessed rigging of bids and fixing of
contracts, there were knowing nods that the anti-monopoly body had finally
met its match. It seemed the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) had drawn
a political line which the investigators cannot cross.
Apart from bruising the FTC's reputation, the case aroused interest in
Washington, which has negotiated a pact providing better access for foreign
contractors in Japan's construction market. The US is especially interested
in dango, or cartels, which it believes are rife in the construction
industry and common in corporate Japan. In this dango, the 66 contractors
routinely rigged bids for government projects worth Y81bn (Pounds 346.15m)
in Saitama Prefecture, part of Greater Tokyo. They agreed among themselves
which company would win a particular contract, then ensured all bidders were
above the cost estimate submitted by that company.
While government officials argue such cases are a rarity, the construction
companies have publicly supported the concept of arguing it provides
stability and enables smaller companies to compete. For fear of trade
friction, these opinions are now kept private, but they are deeply felt. The
US had a close-up view of the workings of dango, when it was found that 145
construction and related companies had rigged bids for 178 projects at a
naval base near Tokyo in the late 1980s. Just over 100 of those companies
have agreed to pay a total of Y4.7bn in compensation to the US government.
In the present case, the punishment has been little more than a wrist-slap.
The FTC has issued a 'cease and desist' order, and last week,
representatives of the 66 companies appeared before the Ministry of
Construction, which said 63 would be forbidden from bidding for select
government projects for a month and three others for two months. The
ministry is commonly perceived to represent the interests of the industry,
and the post of construction minister is sought after by LDP
parliamentarians, who rely heavily on the industry as a source of funds. The
LDP has a construction 'tribe' of politicians, many of them from the party's
largest faction, who ensure a steady flow of lucrative projects in their own
electorates.
Later this week, the ministry is likely to issue a formal instruction to the
companies on the lines of the FTC's 'cease and desist' order. But an
official admitted the month's suspension of bidding would have little impact
on the companies concerned. 'We are fortunate that the period April-June
generally has few big projects. If we had to impose this penalty during July
or August, it would have been a disaster,' he said. The LDP argues that
tougher penalties imposed on the construction dango, or a long court case,
would have damaged the expected recovery of the economy. Although the 66
included most of the industry leaders, including Taisei, Kajima and Kumagai
Gumi, other contractors and, perhaps, a few foreign companies might have
wanted the work.
Both Kajima and Taisei expressed 'regret' for having been involved in
bid-rigging, saying they would 'strengthen their management systems' to
ensure it does not happen again. The implication of the apologies is that
this bout of 'dango' was an exception and not the norm, as Washington
suspects. FTC officials are disappointed that the failure to prosecute has
been generally interpreted as the commission buckling under political
pressure. The commission, which has drawn praise from Washington for its
extra vigilance in the past two years, argues that the Japanese legal system
made a criminal prosecution virtually impossible.
'Under Japanese criminal law, we would have had to prosecute an individual,
not a company; it was felt we would not win in this case. It's hard to win,'
an FTC official said. Criminal charges, the first in 17 years, were filed in
November against eight plastic wrapping makers controlling 97 per cent of
the market, whose executives admitted they regularly held meetings to
discuss market trends and plan price increases. The FTC official insisted
further prosecutions would ensue, and the commission's interest in the
construction 'dango' has not waned.

FT  02 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Multinationals' cross-border trade surges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN direct investment and cross-border trade within multinationals have
surged in the past decade, transforming the shape of international trade and
leading to 'global integration of manufacturing', a World Bank report says.
International trade inside the world's largest 350 multinational companies
accounts for almost 40 per cent of world merchandise trade, which in 1990
amounted to Dollars 3,485bn (Pounds 1,936bn), the bank says in its 1992
report on Global Economic Prospects and the Developing Countries. More than
a third of US trade in 1990, which amounted to Dollars 887.2bn, was between
US companies and their overseas affiliates. A quarter of the purchases of
Japanese companies is from affiliates based in east Asia, while one-third of
the affiliates' purchases is from parent companies in Japan.
The report reveals that in the early 1980s, almost half Singapore's exports
was by US-owned companies; over half Malaysia's exports to the US was from
affiliates of US companies. Taiwan's five top electronics exporters are
US-owned. 'However, the pace of global integration in manufacturing
production appears to be slowing partly as a result of protectionism.'
Underpinning this integration has been an unprecedented rise in foreign
direct investment. After 'unremarkable' growth up to 1982, foreign
investment grew five-fold to average over Dollars 125bn a year between 1985
and 1989. The EC accounted for 47 per cent of this. The EC, US and Japan
together accounted for 80 per cent. Among non-OECD investors, Singapore,
Hong Kong, Taiwan and China 'played an increasingly important role' in the
late 1980s.
Comparatively few countries have benefited from these investment flows, the
bank shows. High-income countries benefited most, winning almost 80 per cent
of the total. Of the Dollars 24bn going to developing countries in 1989,
five states took 80 per cent: China (24 per cent), Brazil (18 per cent),
Mexico (17 per cent), Egypt and Malaysia (10 per cent each).

FT  02 JUN 92 / China returns to 'Great Game' in Central Asia: Beijing's
greatest fear is a rising tide of economic and ethnic turmoil in the
emerging states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LILIAN CRAIG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER a 50-year break, the 'Great Game' has recommenced in Central Asia. The
players have changed but, as in in the 19th and early 20th centuries, ethnic
separatism and regional security are the issues. Now, as then, Islam
provides the focus for political aspirations, and China, a weak player
during the era of British and Russian colonial domination, has emerged as
potentially the most formidable Central Asian force.
The People's Republic of China is an empire, as any visitor to Xinjiang can
readily observe. China's vast north-west province abuts both Mongolia and
three of the five new Central Asian republics, while Chinese citizens of
Uighur, Kazakh, Uzbek and Tadjik 'nationality' live uneasily under Han
Chinese control. Most members of the 12 main ethnic groups living in
Xinjiang are Moslems who look to Turkey and the Middle East as their
spiritual home, not to China, whose control over them has always been
tenuous.
But Xinjiang is enormously valuable to China as a buffer against what it
fears is a rising tide of Middle Eastern and Central Asian turmoil.
Moreover, the agricultural and mineral resources of the region are critical
to China's economic development. Six million Han Chinese immigrants, most of
whom arrived after 1949, and vast petroleum resources ensure that no Chinese
government could consider relinquishing Xinjiang. Chinese officials,
political analysts and religious authorities are reluctant to speak about
ethnic unrest in Xinjiang or the influence of Central Asia on China's
minorities. But nationalist sentiment has been reinforced by independence in
Central Asia, as well as by China's 'open door' economic policy which, since
1978, has brought increased contacts with the Middle East.
China is deeply anxious about Turkish ambitions among Turkic ethnic groups
in Central Asia and about Iranian and Pakistani stimulation for Islamic
fundamentalist sentiments. For the Chinese government, 'spiritual pollution'
wears Islamic as well as western garb.
Pervasive security measures in Xinjiang and the frequent anti-Han
'incidents' provide a constant reminder that China faces a growing and
long-range problem. Several persons died when a bomb exploded on a bus in
February. Further anti-Han demonstrations were reported in several parts of
Xinjiang in early March. The mood is sullen, fuelled not only by Han Chinese
political ascendancy but by Han assertions of cultural superiority.
For now, Beijing is basing its hopes for stability on economic incentives.
Living standards are rising in urban Xinjiang and home use of a larger
percentage of the profit from the regions's resources is at least being
discussed. China has recognised all five of the new Central Asian republics
and is building economic ties with them. But Beijing fears that the Central
Asian states may not be economically viable and that present secular
governments will not remain long in power.
However, Beijing officials discount fears of Chinese military intervention
in the event of serious unrest in Central Asia. How would China react in the
face of a flood of economic refugees or crossborder incidents? Beijing
officials say that refugees would not be allowed in, and that China 'will
never interfere in Central Asia, even if asked by Central Asian
governments'.
Nearly 20,000km of frontier with Middle Eastern and Central Asian states and
overlapping ethnic and tribal ties suggest that it will be difficult for
China to avoid deeper involvement. But at the same time there is little
doubt China would prefer a passive political and military role, one which
does not undermine its self identification as a champion of the developing
world.
There are signs, nonetheless, that China's West Asia policy is in
transition. Despite its suspicions or perhaps because of them, Beijing is
reaffirming economic and military links with Iran and Pakistan in what could
emerge as a quasi-alliance with the Middle East's northern tier. In January,
moreover, China formalised relations with Israel, a state with long if
frequently clandestine ties to Pakistan and Iran. The present plethora of
Israeli delegations to China and contacts with the Central Asia republics
underscore Israeli interest in inserting itself into the equation.
Should Central Asia collapse, under the pressure of economic problems and
religious aspirations, the impact on China, the Middle East and even on
Europe through Turkey would be severe.
The strongest power in Central Asia has always filled the vacuum. China,
which is already more active economically in the region, may find itself
drawn into a broader political, perhaps even military, role.
This is not something western governments or those of surrounding states
would view with equanimity.
The author, recently in Xinjiang, has just completed a book on China's
relations with the Middle East.

   BANGKOK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S private sector called yesterday for the dissolution of parliament
and new elections in an attempt to break a political deadlock following the
killing last month of at least 48 pro-democracy demonstrators.
The Federation of Thai Industries, the Board of Trade of Thailand and the
Thai Bankers' Association made their appeal after a meeting yesterday to
discuss the political crisis. The three groups acknowledged that the
country's image had been tarnished by the clashes between soldiers and
demonstrators but expressed confidence in the future of the Thai economy.
Elections were held in March this year, a year after Gen Suchinda
Kraprayoon, the then armed forces chief, overthrew the previous elected
government on the grounds that it was excessively corrupt.
Five pro-military parties formed a government and eventually chose Gen
Suchinda as prime minister, outraging liberals who took to the streets to
demand a reformed constitution and an end to military influence in politics.
Gen Suchinda was forced to resign, leaving the five discredited coalition
parties casting around for a replacement. In their statement yesterday, the
three private sector organisations said they wanted an interim government
followed by new elections because the present situation did not favour the
formation of 'a permanent government that is of good quality, stable and
acceptable to the public at large'.
Last night Mr Arthit Urairat, the president of the Thai parliament, said he
was postponing the search for a new prime minister until after the
constitutional amendments demanded by the opposition had passed their final
reading in parliament on June 10.
Another unresolved issue arising from the violence is the fate of an amnesty
decreed by Gen Suchinda shortly before he quit. Opposition groups have
challenged the amnesty and referred it to the Constitutional Tribunal
because it covers military officers who ordered the killing as well as
demonstrators.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THREE BANKS yesterday announced credit controls on the Hyundai conglomerate
for funnelling what they called illegal loans to its founder, presidential
candidate Chung Ju-yung, AP reports from Seoul.
Hyundai's main lenders imposed the restrictions on 13 Hyundai subsidiaries
because of their failure to call in loans provided to Chung and his family.
The banks said the loans were illegal because they were not for business
purposes.
Among the 13 subsidiaries are the group's flagship, Hyundai Motor, along
with Hyundai Heavy Industries and Hyundai Engineering and Construction.
Korea Exchange Bank, the main creditor of the three, said that the
subsidiaries defied the banks' order to call in Dollars 23.5m (Pounds 13m)
in loans to Chung and his family by the end of last month. It said they
would be denied the same amount in new loans or the renewal of old loans.
Bank approval for investments in new projects or real estate purchases would
also be suspended.
Yesterday's development was the latest move in a battle between the
government and Hyundai, whose founder heads the country's second largest
opposition party. Following the 76-year-old billionaire's entry into
politics early this year, the government began a series of tax probes and
credit controls against Hyundai, saying that Hyundai funds were flowing to
Chung's party for political purposes.
Last week, a Hyundai executive was prosecuted and Chung was warned by the
government in a case of alleged illegal stock trading. Chung's son and two
advisers were arrested in April on charges of evading taxes.
The government has contended that Chung and his family misused bank loans
and traded stocks illegally to funnel funds into his party. Chung, however,
claims he has severed ties with Hyundai and all his political funds come
from his personal assets, estimated at more than Dollars 3bn.
Last month, Chung was nominated as his party's candidate for presidential
elections at the end of this year.

<TEXT>
MR F W de Klerk yesterday used the first state visit of a South African
president to Russia since the war to declare that ' we have turned our back
on apartheid and will not return to it'.
He denied that the stalemate in talks on reform of the South African
constitution was because 'the whites are demanding a constitutional veto'.
He said that the search for a new constitutional basis for the republic was
'to create through negotiation not a win-lose situation, but a win-win
situation'.
The South African president's visit officially ended decades of polemics
between the Soviet Union and South Africa, during which Moscow supported the
South African Communist party with large cash injections and - according to
documents published over the weekend by the daily Izvestia - prompted it to
attempt an armed uprising in the 1930s.
Mr de Klerk said that he had come to Russia 'because communism is dead - I
would not have come before that and would not have been welcome before
that'.
In spite of this perception, his visit has been criticised by pro-Communist
deputies in the Russian parliament - while the African National Congress has
also criticised his trip, and said it would oppose a visit by Mr Boris
Yeltsin, the Russian president, and any other foreign leader while the
apartheid system still oper-ated.
South Africa restored diplomatic relations with Russia in February. Mr de
Klerk announced a 'modest' credit line of R100m (Pounds 19.4m) to assist
trade between the two countries.
Russia and South Africa, as the world's two main gold and diamond producers,
have a strong mutual interest in their price levels. The president denied,
however, any intention of pursuing a cartel in either, referring journalists
to Mr Harry Oppenheimer, the former chairman of Anglo American Corporation,
the large South African mining group.
The two presidents signed a communique stressing the need to ensure
democratic elections in Angola and to reach a ceasefire in Mozambique.
Mr de Klerk said that he envisaged South Africa becoming the 'hub' of an
economic union of 11 to 12 Southern African states, including Namibia and
Mozambique, with 'exciting prospects' for economic development.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Key US index signals growth acceleration
</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A SURGE in the purchasing managers' index - a closely followed barometer of
industrial conditions - yesterday signalled an acceleration in the momentum
of US economic recovery.
The index rose to 56.3 per cent last month against 51.3 per cent in April.
This was the strongest reading for three years and well above financial
markets' expectations.
'It's the gong that announces the recovery is here to stay,' said Mr David
Jones, chief economist at Aubrey Lanston, the New York broker. Growth was
likely to accelerate from an annual rate of 2.4 per cent in the first
quarter to 3-3.5 per cent during the summer, he said.
Mr David Hale, chief economist at Kemper Financial Companies in Chicago,
said the surge in the index pointed to strong growth in industrial
production as companies rebuilt inventories after the lengthy downturn.
Rebuilding of inventories could add 1.5 percentage points to the growth rate
in the current quarter, he said.
The index is usually a reliable guide to economic trends. It dipped between
March and April but is now decisively above the 50 per cent threshold
indicating expansion in manufacturing. Components of the index pointed
almost unanimously to sustained recovery.
The index for new orders rose to 61 per cent, against 56.7 per cent in
April. Indices for export orders, production and prices rose sharply. The
employment index also rose significantly, but remained below the 50 per cent
threshold indicating growth of jobs.
Other economic data released yesterday were less encouraging, but related to
April when the economy seemed to experience a dip.
The Commerce Department said personal income rose only 0.1 per cent in
April, the second month of sluggish growth after a sharp rise in February.
After allowing for inflation, disposable incomes fell 0.2 per cent.
In real terms, personal consumption spending rose 0.1 per cent in April,
following a 0.5 per cent decline a month earlier.
Official figures also showed a 0.3 per cent decline in construction spending
in April following a strong gain in March.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Political fog descends on the last primary rites: The
uncertainties that lie beyond inevitable wins for George Bush and Bill
Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS is not the first time that California has held a presidential primary
too late to make a difference. But it may be unprecedented that the largest
state of the union, the seventh (Ohio), the ninth (New Jersey), and three
others (Alabama, Montana and New Mexico) should go through their quadrennial
political rites today and attract such little attention.
There are two obvious reasons for this state of affairs. The first is that
Mr Ross Perot, the Texas businessman set to run as an independent, is on
none of the ballots and his growing legion of supporters will have
difficulty registering their preference by writing in his name or voting for
uncommitted slates of delegates.
The second is that President George Bush and Arkansas Governor Bill Clinton
are assured of the Republican and Democratic parties' nominations
respectively. Mr Bush has been over the top in the delegate count for a
month, and it is inconceivable that Mr Clinton will not get the roughly 150
more delegates he needs out of the 700 to be awarded today.
There is interest, of course, in the contest in California between Mr
Clinton and Mr Jerry Brown, the former California governor. While his
campaign briefly flourished in the spring Mr Brown was the favourite out
west, but most local polls now give Mr Clinton the edge, although not by
much.
The polls also report that Mr Perot would carry California easily if the
presidential election were held now. Although write-in votes for him in
California today will not be counted because he is not a certified
candidate, his supporters could send their message by voting for Mr Brown in
the Democratic race or the conservative political commentator Pat Buchanan
in the Republican contest.
A loss for Mr Clinton would not be fatal, but it would not help at a time
when his campaign is struggling to be heard. Both Mr Jimmy Carter in 1976
and 1980 and Mr Walter Mondale in 1984 lost the California primary - to Mr
Brown, Mr Edward Kennedy and Mr Gary Hart in turn - but went on to win the
nomination. Mr Clinton must hope that the first of these precedents, in
which Mr Carter went on to the presidency, and not the last two, holds good.
Mr Bush's big concern is that his popularity in California, a Republican
stronghold in recent presidential elections, has slipped so alarmingly. The
state's lagging economy is obviously a factor, an issue he sought to address
in his weekend campaign swing.
Fewer pitfalls appear to await the two party frontrunners in Ohio and New
Jersey, where neither Mr Bush nor Mr Clinton has appeared much - the same
goes for Mr Brown and Mr Buchanan. This is an unusual circumstance for both
states, especially Ohio.
Outside the presidential arena most interest centres on the two California
races for the US Senate - one for the remaining two years of the term
vacated by Republican Pete Wilson when he became the state's governor and
the other for the full six-year term to succeed Democratic Alan Cranston,
who is retiring.
There is a good chance that two women will win the Democratic primaries. Mrs
Dianne Feinstein, the former mayor of San Francisco who ran Mr Wilson close
in the 1990 governor's contest, is the favourite today - as she is to defeat
in November Mr John Seymour, the Republican who was appointed to replace Mr
Wilson.
Ms Barbara Boxer, the feminist congresswoman, faces a tougher contest
against Lieutenant Governor Leo McCarthy, the establishment moderate
insider, and Congressman Mel Levine, the Los Angeles liberal whose campaign
has taken on a sharp law-and-order theme after the city's riots.
Success for Mrs Feinstein and Ms Boxer would be seen as confirming the
growth of women's political power.
The congressional candidacy of Ms Jane Harman in the Los Angeles suburbs is
being watched for the same reason. Should she win the Democratic primary,
she might find herself in November up against Ms Maureen Reagan, the former
president's daughter and favourite for the Republican nomination in the
district.
Republican Senate fights in California once again pit southern
arch-conservatives against northern moderates. Mr Seymour will probably beat
Mr William Dannemayer, one of the most reactionary members of Congress, but
the contest between Congressman Tom Campbell and Mr Bruce Herschensohn, an
outspoken Los Angeles TV commentator, is closer.
In both races abortion has become a dominant issue. Victories for Mr Seymour
and Mr Campbell, both, like Governor Wilson, in favour of choice in
reproductive matters, might suggest that Mr Bush's determination to keep the
Republicans on an anti-abortion tack is out of tune with majority opinion in
his party.
Typically, California also had a fistful of referenda on issues which may
have wider ramifications. Perhaps the most controversial is the 'Buy
America' initiative on the Los Angeles ballot, which would amend the city
charter to give procurement preference to California contractors.
Its opponents believe this would deter the foreign investment sought by Mr
Peter Ueberroth, who is in charge of reconstruction for riot-ravaged Los
Angeles. However, one poll says the amendment will pass.
Elsewhere in the country most interest focuses on the performance of
incumbent members of congress, increasingly seen as an endangered species.
Typical is the Ohio case of Ms Rose Mary Oakar, whose bid for a ninth term
is clouded by the fact that she overdrew her account on the House of
Representatives bank more than 200 times.
But nothing in the internal political woodwork of the six states voting
today can disguise the fact that, for the moment, the minds of the voters
are looking ahead to November and into a political fog more impenetrable
than anything which regularly descends on San Francisco.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Dinkins makes a strong sales pitch for the Big Apple
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEN WARN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MUST be a tough job making a sales pitch for the city that attracts the
worst press coverage in the world, regularly portrayed as a den of iniquity
teetering on the brink of social disintegration.
But Mr David Dinkins, New York City's soft-spoken and mild-mannered mayor,
musters all the enthusiasm he can. 'I like to try to sell New York 24 hours
a day, seven days a week. I'm constantly selling New York. We want to tell
European businesses: If your thoughts are for expansion in the US you could
not do better than New York City. It's the gateway to America.'
Mr Dinkins was in London yesterday as part of a joint effort by the New York
City Partnership and the Chamber of Commerce to promote the city as a US
base for foreign companies.
The delegation, which moves on to Paris, Frankfurt and Hamburg later this
week, was due to see a range of UK businesses, particularly design, retail,
financial services, communication and entertainment companies. The visit
includes meetings with the London Chamber of Commerce and the Design
Council.
'We don't expect to go home with a bundle of contracts,' Mr Dinkins told the
Financial Times yesterday. 'But we believe this an excellent opportunity to
convey what a good place New York is to do business.'
Setting aside his sales patter, Mr Dinkins is frank about the reasons for
his push to heighten international interest. 'During New York's financial
problems in the late 1980s we realised we had to find ways to expand our tax
base. We believe that small businesses - those with 100 or fewer employees -
and international involvement provided the way ahead. So this philosophy is
not new.'
At the same time Mr Dinkins denies that New York is suffering a loss of US
corporations to smaller cities or greenfield sites. 'It's true that some
have left, but it's also true that many have expanded and put more money in
 -ITT is an excellent example. A lot of companies are coming and going, but
we think we net out pretty well.'
New York is particularly keen to hang on to Morgan Stanley, the Wall Street
investment house which has been pondering a move to Connecticut. Mr Barry
Sullivan, deputy mayor for finance and economic development, was in talks
with Morgan until just before he left for Europe.
'We have put an attractive package on the table which we are just
finalising,' Mr Sullivan says. 'I feel pretty good about what the result
will be - but it is not decided as we speak.'
New York's communications, its status as an international city, tax
incentive programmes and declining office rents form the basis of the
mayor's appeal to European business.
Mr Sullivan is also eager to dispel New York's image as a city mired in
financial crisis. 'For three successive years New York has produced budgets
on time that are balanced or even in surplus. We work very hard on our
fiscal health,' he says. Both men believe New York's 10-year Dollars 47bn
(Pounds 26.1bn) capital expenditure programme will go a long way to
addressing some concerns over the city's ageing infrastructure that might
deter investors.
None the less, Mr Dinkins recognises that selling New York is an uphill
struggle in the face of almost ceaseless negative coverage, particularly of
its ethnic tensions.

THE Colombian government said yesterday that it had granted political asylum
to the former Peruvian president, Mr Alan Garca, who had taken refuge in its
ambassador's residence in Lima.
Mr Garca, president from 1985 to 1990, has been a fugitive since Peruvian
President Alberto Fujimori dissolved Congress and suspended the judiciary on
April 5.
Mr Garca's party, the American Popular Revolutionary Alliance (Apra), said
it had instructed him to leave the country because his life was in danger.
He entered the Colombian embassy on Sunday evening. Last week Mr Garca made
a surprise appearance in one of Lima's shanty towns and was being seen as
the main focus of opposition to Mr Fujimori. Colombian radio said Mr Garca
was to be flown to Colombia last night in a private plane.
Amnesty International, the human rights group, said yesterday that human
rights violations had continued in Peru since President Fujimori took power
nearly two years ago, writes Stephen Fidler, Latin America Editor. It
expressed concern about 'widespread 'disappearances' and extra-judicial
executions by the security forces'.

A US judge yesterday fined Rockwell International Dollars 18.5m (Pounds
10.2m) for violating environmental laws at a nuclear weapons plant it once
operated, Reuter reports from Denver.
It is the largest fine in the US for hazardous waste violations and the
second largest under environmental laws, after the Dollars 125m fine and
restitution resulting from the Exxon Valdez oil spill in 1989.
Rockwell had pleaded guilty to violations at its Rocky Flats plant, near
Denver. Judge Sherman Finesilver noted that the fine was the maximum
allowed. Three environmental groups told the court last week that closed
records of a four-year investigation, which led to the charges, would reveal
public officials also violated environmental laws. The company admitted
illegal treatment and storage of hazardous wastes and the illegal disposal
of contaminated water.
Prosecutors said the Energy Department, which owns the plant, shared the
blame.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Hopes rise for declining rate of inflation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES and AP-DJ
</BYLINE>

   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT fall in west German import prices accelerated in April,
reinforcing optimism that inflation is on the way down again. Export prices
rose further, but the rate of increase appears to be slowing, writes
Christopher Parkes in Bonn.
Cheaper fresh produce and raw coffee, down by 15 per cent and 4 per cent
respectively on the previous month, contributed to a 2.5 per cent overall
reduction against April last year, the federal statistics office said
yesterday.
The drop followed year-on-year falls of 1.5 per cent in March and 1.2 per
cent in February.
The 1 per cent increase in export prices followed a 1.4 per cent increase in
February and 1.2 per cent in March.
May inflation of 4.5 per cent, compared with 4.6 per cent a month earlier,
matched most forecasts. These also predict a decline to around 3.5 per cent
in mid-year, when special levies imposed last July on oil and other goods,
drop out of the reckoning.
Germany's recent rounds of wage settlements have not brought about the
turnaround necessary to curb inflation, Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the
Bundesbank president, warned in Washington last night, AP-DJ reports from
Frankfurt. In a speech delivered to the American Institute for Contemporary
American Studies, he said this was serious, even though 1992 pacts had been
somewhat lower than those reached a year ago.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S aerospace industry has made serious tactical blunders in its
campaign to participate in building the European fighter aircraft (EFA), and
now has virtually no chance of winning a majority for the project in the
Bundestag, said a leading parliamentary defence spokesman.
Dr Werner Hoyer, the defence expert for the Free Democrats (FDP) in the
Bundestag, warned that the issue would be decided on an emotional, not a
factual basis. He is one of the six-man working group which met last night
to recommend the degree of Germany's future participation in the project.
In an interview shortly beforehand, he said there was no hope of a
parliamentary majority in favour of allocating more funds to the EFA project
next year in the current climate of budget cuts.
The deep disagreements about the aircraft within the governing German
coalition were made clear yesterday when two leading politicians differed
fundamentally over what should be done.
Mr Erich Riedl, a member of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU)
and state secretary in the Economics Ministry, said tens of thousands of
jobs in the German aerospace industry would be lost if Germany pulled out of
the project. 'Every politician thinks he will win elections at home if he is
against the EFA,' he said in a radio interview. 'But it is wrong, even
irresponsible, to think like that.'
The opposite viewpoint was put by Mr Peter Hintze, newly appointed as
secretary-general of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU). He
said the EFA was not appropriate 'in the changed financial and security
situation in a united Germany'.
The CSU has succeeded in having a decision on the project deferred, with
tomorrow's joint meeting of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group postponed to
June 16.
Dr Hoyer believes that in spite of the delay, the fate of German
participation is sealed. 'The decisive point in our report is whether the
working group recommends, or whether the defence minister recommends,
allocating some DM100m (Pounds 34m) in the 1993 budget for pre-production
costs (for EFA), to purchase the tools needed for later construction,' Dr
Hoyer said. 'The industry insists these tools will be needed. The decision
to put this into the budget will be seen as a point of no return. But there
is no majority in the Bundestag in favour.
'It is a catastrophic mistake by the German (aerospace) industry to have
insisted on this. They thought they could get a positive decision now.'
Dr Hoyer said that no alternative aircraft should be automatically excluded.
However, he said he would not vote for any solution which would be more
expensive than the EFA.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Russian central bank chairman resigns: Matiukhin blames a
running dispute with parliament over interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chairman of the Russian central bank offered his resignation yesterday,
blaming disputes with parliament, especially over interest rate policy, for
his decision.
Mr Georgy Matiukhin, in office for barely a year and the butt of ferocious
criticism in the press and parliament, said his decision was final. The move
seems set to be approved by parliament, which contains some of his sharpest
critics.
The resignation - which came on the day Russia formally joined the
International Monetary Fund - throws open the sensitive arena of financial
policy to a bitter political feud between government and president on the
one side and parliament on the other over the choice of a successor and the
setting of bank policy. Parliament is constitutionally responsible for the
bank, but President Boris Yeltsin says the bank takes its orders from him,
and the government has sought to exert pressure on it.
This struggle is certain to become part of a larger conflict between
president and parliament over the scope of presidential powers. Mr Yeltsin
has promised to hold a referendum on the constitution, and on the private
ownership of land - both issues on which he has been blocked by the
deputies.
If he attempts also to take the central bank out of parliament's control,
the much-awaited showdown between the presidential and legislative levels of
government could not be delayed further.
Two possible replacement candidates have been much discussed in recent weeks
as it became clear that Mr Matiukhin was under growingpressure. They are Mr
Boris Feodorov, a senior official of the London-based European Bank for
Reconstruction and Development and a former finance minister of Russia; and
Mr Viktor Gerashchenko, former chairman of the Soviet State Bank (Gosbank),
who commands considerable respect.
Mr Feodorov would be the choice of the economic reformers in the cabinet,
led by Mr Yegor Gaidar, the first deputy prime minister. However, Mr
Gerashchenko, some 30 years his senior, may command support in parliament.
Mr Matiukhin has been blamed for pushing interest rates up to 80 per cent;
for starving enterprises of cash to pay wages and for restricting credit to
the point where inter-enterprise debt has rocketed to the figure of
Rbs1.7trillion. Mr Vladimir Arutunyan, head of Nefteexport, Russia's main
oil exporting company, has resigned, Reuter reports. No reason was given for
the move, which followed that of Mr Vladimir Lopukhin, the country's energy
minister, last week.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Moscow sets terms for defence of borders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RUSSIA'S defence minister said yesterday that intervention of foreign troops
in states adjoining Russia, or the build-up of troops on their borders,
would be seen as a direct military threat to Russia.
General Pavel Grachev, recently appointed to the top defence post, told a
conference in which a number of Nato officials are participating that Russia
saw no state or group of states as hostile to it. It would, however, react
forcefully to any state which sought regional domination.
This definition of Russia's 'sphere of interest' means it sees all of the
former Soviet states on its land borders as areas in which it has a right to
intervene if it believes they are under threat. These would include the
three Baltic states, the western states of Ukraine and Belarus, the Caucasus
to the south and the central Asian state of Kazakhstan.
This is in spite of the fact that Russia has not concluded a collective
security agreement with most of these states. Belarus, Ukraine, Georgia and
Azerbaijan, as well as the Baltic states - which are not in the Commonwealth
of Independent States - have all refused to sign a security agreement.
Ukraine increasingly sees itself as opposed to Russia.
General Grachev promised sweeping changes in the Russian army over the next
10 years - including a cut of 700,000 men by 1995 and a further 600,000 cut
by the end of the decade. The planned size of the Russian army is 1.3m-1.5m.
Mr Viktor Mikhailov, head of the Russian Atomic Ministry, told the same
conference that 'nuclear weapons ensure the stability of the world - even
today'. He said Russia now controlled 80 per cent of nuclear weapons
production facilities of the former Soviet Union - with the remaining 20 per
cent confined to ore extraction and processing.
The nuclear weapons industry had 140,000 employees - 14 per cent of those
employed in the atomic industry as a whole.
He said that 15,000 nuclear warheads, or 50 per cent of the former Soviet
nuclear potential, would be destroyed. However, this process would take 10
to 15 years and would cost Dollars 2bn (Pounds 1.1bn).
The heads of the Ukrainian and Crimean parliaments agreed yesterday that
Crimea would remain part of Ukraine but enjoy special economic status,
Reuter reports.
Itar-Tass news agency said a statement issued after a meeting in Yalta
described the Crimean peninsula, once under Russian jurisdiction, as 'an
integral part of Ukraine'.
The two sides will form a working group by June 5 to continue work on power
sharing arrangements.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Slovak populist shakes the federalist foundation: Word
'independence' is avoided, but rhetoric is unambiguous
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
STANDING in the medieval square of the small town of Banska Stvianica in
central Slovakia, Mr Vladimir Meciar, the most popular politician in the
republic, works the crowd with the well-trained techniques he learned in his
boxing career.
His large silhouette positioned beneath the statue of Saint Sebastian, he
answers written questions allegedly gathered from the crowd. In
well-prepared verbal blows, Mr Meciar displays his wit as he blends
political slogans with well-timed jokes about his enemies.
An expected winner in Friday's elections for the regional republic's
parliament, the Slovak National Council, he knows when to strike. Since
joining the opposition in the assembly after a spell as regional prime
minister a year ago, his popularity increased in parallel with the growth of
nationalism in Slovakia, the smaller of the two republics in the
Czechoslovak federation.
With an average 30 per cent support in the opinion polls for his party, the
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, and support from other smaller parties,
he represents the greatest threat facing the federation since the demise of
communism.
The party's programme calls on the Slovak parliament to declare the
republic's sovereignty. He has also promised to push through a constitution
which would take precedence over the federal one. He says that a referendum
would then be put 'if the Czechs and Slovaks continue to disagree'.
Representatives of the Czech and Slovak governments have been unable to
agree a post-communist relationship. As negotiations continued to fail and
Slovakia's unemployment rate soared to three times that of neighbouring
Czech lands, nationalists fuelled the growing resentment against the federal
government.
The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia receives between 25 and 34 per cent
in the various opinion polls, but his policies also have the backing of
other parties with which he might be able to construct a parliamentary
majority. Moreover, together they could put together a strong bloc in the
federal parliament in partnership with the Czech republic's left-wing
parties. Right-wing politicians have warned in Prague that his victory could
herald the end of a workable federal parliament.
Mr Meciar's calls for increased state subsidies for ailing enterprises has
won the support of the Democratic Left Party, the renamed communist party,
which, while allegedly pro-federation, is calling for greater state
intervention in the transition to a free market. Led by a charismatic and
relatively young man, Mr Petr Weiss, it gets about 12 per cent in the polls.
His party is also supported by smaller, but equally nationalist parties, in
Slovakia, such as the Slovak National Party, the only party to call openly
for independence. It has an estimated 10 per cent support in the Slovak
population.
Careful to avoid the word 'independence,' Mr Meciar talks about 'increased
autonomy.' Polls show that only a small minority wants outright
independence. Still, the rhetoric is unambiguous: 'If we want to be the
equal of other countries in Europe,' he told his Banska Stvianica rally, 'we
have to join it as separate state. Slovakia must have its own legal status
in Europe. We must be able to take decisions by ourselves and with our own
money.'
President Havel, after a recent meeting with Mr Meciar, warned of 'dangerous
ideas about the possibility of dissolving the common state from above and
constituting fully independent republics. . . . then tied in a vague dualist
union.' Speaking at the opening of his own electoral campaign, Mr Havel
stressed that this would lead 'to nothing but a chaotic break-up of the
state'.

FRANCE'S two-month-old government narrowly survived a no-confidence motion
yesterday when the opposition, unusually backed by the Communists, fell just
three votes short of toppling Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister,
Reuter reports from Paris.
The centre-right opposition called the motion against the minority Socialist
government in protest at European Community agriculture policy reforms, but
also used it to voice wider opposition to France's integration with the rest
of Europe.
Pro-European centrist deputies, including Mr Raymond Barre, a former prime
minister, did not vote for the motion which only just failed to gain the 289
votes needed for a majority in the 576-seat national assembly.

FT  02 JUN 92 / EC hits at US Earth Summit stance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB and GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community accused the US yesterday of threatening the outcome
of the Earth Summit because of its refusal to sign a treaty central to the
success of the environmental gathering.
The summit, due to start in Rio de Janeiro tomorrow, has already been
plagued by acrimony between developed and developing nations.
Expectations about what the 10-day summit could achieve were further lowered
by Mr John Major, the prime minister, who said some people were expecting
too much from it.
'I am very keen for us to make progress generally at the Rio summit,' Mr
Major said during a visit to south-west Scotland. 'But I have been warning
for some time that some of the expectations for the summit are higher than
those that can be realistically achieved.'
Mr Laurens Jan Brinkhorst, who is leading the EC's delegation, said in Rio
that the US was in danger of creating a rift within the industrialised world
at the summit by refusing to sign a convention on species conservation, or
biological diversity.
'We're very disappointed with the US decision. It will be very sad if it
results in a cleavage not just between developed and developing countries
but also between developed countries.'
The developing world had bent over backwards to please the US and 'they are
not seeing an appropriate response', he added.
In Washington, President George Bush proposed a doubling in world spending
on forest conservation to Dollars 2.7bn (Pounds 1.5bn) and offered Dollars
150m of US funds as a 'downpayment' for his initiative. The announcement
appeared to be an attempt to deflect criticism of the US over its
announcement on the biodiversity treaty.
US officials also say they do not believe the Rio summit will be able to
agree on a once hoped for forestry convention. They acknowledged that the
extra funding might well not be available before 1994, and would be offset
by other spending cuts.
A senior US official said Mr Bush had written to leaders of the Group of
Seven leading industrialised nations and the EC about his proposal. A US
official said: 'This (the US initiative) is quite an effective approach to
dealing with bio-diversity. This is not rhetoric, this is reality.'
Members of developing countries said they were angry at what they saw as an
attempt by the US to deflect criticism with its forests initiative.
Both the EC and the developing world had accepted a weaker convention on
climate change to accommodate the US, Mr Brinkhorst said. 'We in the EC
believe it is very important to make ourselves credible to developing
countries by showing that the developed world is not only offering words but
taking steps to put our own houses in order.'
'It is not a beauty contest but while we in the EC have increased
development aid to 0.5 per cent of GNP the US has cut its from 0.3 to 0.2
per cent.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Investigators unravel Maxwell web: Liechtenstein companies
are beyond the reach of creditors and pensioners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRONWEN MADDOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INVESTIGATORS have uncovered a number of Liechtenstein-controlled companies
with links to the Maxwell family which are beyond the reach of creditors and
pensioners of the collapsed Maxwell empire.
One of them, Sphere Inc, a Californian computer games company, expects to
have turnover of Dollars 20m (Pounds 11m) this year. Another, Pergamon
Holdings (US) Inc, was used to pay Mr Kevin Maxwell, former chief executive
of Maxwell Communication Corporation.
Until two months ago Mr Kevin Maxwell was a director of Sphere Inc, and his
sister, Ms Christine Maxwell, is still on the board.
The news of the family links with at least one significant company comes
less than a week before representatives of 30,000 present and former Maxwell
staff, whose pension funds have lost more than Pounds 400m, march on the
House of Commons to demand compensation. The companies are separate
subsidiaries of the secretive Maxwell Foundation in Vaduz which was also the
ultimate owner of Robert Maxwell's complex web of businesses.
In addition to the Liechtenstein-controlled companies, investigators also
have been examining at least one private company owned directly by members
of the Maxwell family. The company, Fivetell, has been used to hold family
stakes in top football clubs. According to the latest company records, Mr
Ian Maxwell, former chief executive of Mirror Group Newspapers (MGN), owns
51 per cent of the company.
Investigators believe that last year 'substantial funds' were transferred
into Pergamon Holdings (US) Inc from Maxwell companies throughout the world,
including Macmillan, the US publisher and the most valuable asset of MCC.
Investigators understand that one of the company's functions was to pay Mr
Kevin Maxwell, a legitimate activity, and a common structure in many
companies.
On April 3 1992, Pergamon Holdings (US) Inc registered an interest in Mr
Kevin Maxwell's house, which is believed to be worth more than Pounds 1m.
Investigators are unclear whether the company had other functions, or
whether it still contains assets. Their examination has been inhibited
because they cannot penetrate the Liechtenstein rules of confidentiality.
Robert Maxwell took an 80 per cent stake in Sphere, based in Alameda,
California, in 1987. It operated as a sister company to Mirrorsoft, a UK
computer games company owned by MGN, but Sphere was always owned separately.
Mr Gilman Louie, the founder of the company, yesterday confirmed that he
believed the ultimate ownership was in Liechtenstein. Mr Louie said this had
fortunately insulated the company from the chaos surrounding the Maxwell
businesses.
'We are trading as normal,' he said.
Yesterday administrators said they understood that Sphere was a direct
subsidiary of the Maxwell Charitable Foundation in Liechtenstein. Mr Werner
Keicher, trustee of the Maxwell Foundation in Liechtenstein, confirmed there
was a link between Sphere and the foundation.
Because of uncertainty about future ownership Mr Louie has been talking to
potential backers.
Ms Christine Maxwell yesterday declined to comment on Sphere's present
ownership and assets when contacted at Research on Demand, the San Francisco
company of which she is director.

FT  02 JUN 92 / R-R and Westinghouse forge power generation alliance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS and IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROLLS-ROYCE and Westing-house yesterday forged a strategic alliance to
challenge General Electric of the US for leadership in the large power
generation business.
The 15-year agreement between the UK aero-engine company and the US power
systems group will provide Westinghouse with advanced aero-engine technology
for new large power generating systems and strengthen Rolls-Royce's position
in industrial power generation.
The deal will make the partnership the world's second largest power
generation group after GE.
Westinghouse and Rolls-Royce are already collaborating in the development of
a gas turbine engine for the US Navy after winning a Dollars 160m (Pounds
89m) engine development contract in January. The agreement announced
yesterday extends this co-operation across the whole field of large power
generation systems.
The partnership will also introduce Rolls-Royce into the gas turbine
alliance between Westinghouse, Japan's Mitsubishi Heavy Industries and
FiatAvio of Italy.
Rolls-Royce, which acquired Britain's Northern Engineering Industries (NEI)
three years ago, has been seeking to expand its industrial power activities
which already account for about 40 per cent of the group's annual turnover.
Sir Ralph Robins, chief executive, indicated last week that Rolls-Royce's
long-term strategy was to reach a 50-50 balance between aero-engines and
industrial power.
Yesterday's deal underlined the increasing demand for aero-engine technology
by makers of power generating systems, which operate under similar
conditions of extreme heat.
GE has large aero-engine and industrial power divisions, while Siemens of
Germany has teamed up with Pratt &amp; Whitney of the US.
Under yesterday's agreement, Rolls-Royce said it would transfer aero-engine
technology to Westinghouse for use in existing and future industrial
combustion turbine designs. In return, Westinghouse will transfer selected
steam turbine, combustion turbine and combined cycle technologies.
The two companies will also co-operate in marketing Rolls-Royce aero-derived
gas turbine engines including the RB211 and the Trent for power generation
applications.
The Westinghouse agreement raises questions over Rolls-Royce's relationship
with ABB Asea Brown Boveri, the Swedish-Swiss group. Rolls-Royce already
co-operates with ABB in the UK market and there has been regular speculation
that the two groups would forge closer links.
Rolls-Royce said last night that the Westinghouse deal would not affect that
relationship.
Mr Fritz Gautschi, general manager of ABB's gas turbine and combined cycle
power division, said his group had not talked in detail with Rolls-Royce
about its new alliance. He said the joint venture with NEI would continue.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Hanson and P&amp;O would make Canary Wharf offers under Pounds
600m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD, VANESSA HOULDER, IVO DAWNAY and MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO POTENTIAL corporate purchasers of Canary Wharf have separately concluded
that the insolvent office project in London's Docklands is worth no more
than Pounds 600m.
Hanson, the Anglo-US conglomerate, and P&amp;O, the UK shipping and property
group, would be likely to offer considerably less than that figure if either
decided to bid for the development. The project cost Pounds 1.3bn to build.
Canary Wharf was put into administration last week by Olympia &amp; York.
Hanson's and P&amp;O's conclusions about the value of Canary Wharf emerged
yesterday as the government's proposals to move civil servants to Docklands
came under fire from Westminster Council, central London landowners and
Civil Service unions.
They stepped up their lobbying of senior ministers including Lord Wakeham,
lord privy seal, who is co-ordinating government negotiations on Canary
Wharf.
Lord Wakeham also met Lord White, chairman of Hanson Industries in the US.
According to one of Hanson's financial advisers, Lord Wakeham was told
Hanson would be interested in bidding only if banks wrote off most of Canary
Wharf's Pounds 1.2bn debts and the government proved flexible on O&amp;Y's
promised Pounds 400m contribution to extend the Underground Jubilee line.
Lord Sterling, chairman of P&amp;O, which has been closely involved in Canary
Wharf's development as owner of Bovis, the construction company, would not
consider putting in more than a few hundred million pounds of new money if
it decided to make a bid, according to a financier close to P&amp;O.
The Labour party is set to press Mr Michael Howard, environment secretary,
today to explain what criteria will govern any decision to move Whitehall
departments or agencies and on the future of the Jubilee line.
At a meeting of senior ministers chaired by Lord Wakeham, Mr Michael
Portillo, chief secretary to the Treasury, made clear any move could only be
approved on grounds of value for money.
Mr David Weeks, leader of Westminster council, warned that an exodus of
4,000 civil servants could have a 'very severe' impact on the economic
health of Victoria, where many government offices are located. The run-down
could prompt other organisations to leave, probably for mainland Europe, he
said.
Central London property owners including Land Securities and Chesterfield
Properties urged the government - in letters to Lord Wakeham - to put the
health of central London and its transport systems before Docklands. Mr
Peter Hunt, chairman of Land Securities, said: 'It should not take a
decision for political expediency to the detriment of central London and the
taxpayer.'
Ms Elizabeth Symons, general secretary of the First Division Association,
which represents top civil servants, wrote to Sir Terence Heiser, permanent
secretary at the Environment Department, warning of fears that the move was
less about the department's efficient functioning and more with the
political need to sustain the Docklands scheme. She called for the
publication of a cost benefit analysis before a decision.
Mr Leslie Christie, general secretary of the National Union of Civil and
Public Servants, said he was not against relocation in principle but would
strongly oppose any move intended to solve political problems.
If Hanson acquired Canary Wharf, Lord White said the conglomerate would have
an enormous property arm.
'We are heading into this as fast as we can. Our team is moving right away
to see the administrator,' he said. 'This could be one of the most exciting
projects. If we did acquire the development it would make a good fit with
our property redevelopment plans in the US.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (16): Technology alone is not
enough - An issue underlying the labyrinthine discussions at Rio is
technology transfer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYONE is aware that, if practical progress is to be made on any of the
specific problems, from global warming to the extinction of wildlife
species, scientific knowledge and technical skills will have to be
transferred on a huge scale from industrialised to developing countries.
Yet 'technology transfer', a frequent incantation in the preparatory work
for the Earth Summit, is poorly defined - and understood differently by
people on opposite sides of the North-South divide.
Politicians from developing countries tend to imagine that the
industrialised world contains a treasure trove of advanced technology,
locked up by greedy companies and insensitive governments.
They see the system of protecting intellectual property through patents as a
particular barrier to setting poorer nations on the path to clean growth.
The western point of view - shared on the whole by governments, companies
and environmental groups - is that the Third World's pre-occupation with
hi-tech is misguided. Indeed, as Mr Chris Rose, programmes director of
Greenpeace, notes, 'the South has become particularly obsessed with
biotechnology.
The United Nations preparatory committee for the Earth Summit pointed out
that 'a large body of useful technological knowledge lies in the public
domain and is unaffected by the international patent system. Also, most
proprietary technology is available through commercial channels.'
The barriers which developing countries have to overcome before they can tap
this pool of knowledge are, in order of increasing size: finding out about
the appropriate techniques; establishing the infrastructure to introduce
them; and, above all, paying for them.
Several regional and international clearing houses already exist to exchange
information about environmental technology. A fairly wide-ranging example is
the UN Environment Programme's Industry and the Environment Office in Paris.
Others organisations transfer information in more specialised fields.
One new example is the International Service for the Acquisition of
Agri-biotech Applications, which is being set up at Cornell University, New
York.
It aims to tell farmers in developing countries how to increase yields while
using less pesticide; ISAAA will concentrate on passing on biotechnology
which has been tried and tested in the west and which can be introduced
without disrupting traditional agriculture.
But the Earth Summit organisers are looking for a great expansion in the
network of technology information exchanges. They estimate that the
international community would have to contribute Dollars 150m to Dollars
200m a year to their running costs.
The UK government commissioned two studies of technology transfer by the
consultants Touche Ross, to help prepare for the Earth Summit. One looked at
climate change and the other at biodiversity. Both concluded that aid
agencies have concentrated too much so far on transferring 'hard'
technologies and have seriously neglected maintenance programmes and 'soft'
technologies such as training and developing local skills.
'People tend to regard technology transfer as handing over the blueprints
for a process,' says Mr John Coleman, environmental affairs manager for ICI,
the UK-based chemicals group.
'But it's much more complex than that. Handing over the blueprints is only
about a third of the story.'
As Mr Coleman points out, if you build a chemical plant in a developing
country without training the operators properly, 'people could do immense
environmental damage by operating the plant wrongly.'
The international chemical companies no longer build cheap and dirty plants
in the Third World. They now try actively to transfer the best environmental
technology to their subsidiaries.
The ICI policy, in the somewhat cumbersome phrasing of Sir Denys Henderson,
chairman, is that the company will 'build new plants anywhere in the world
to the (environmental) standards which we can reasonably foresee will be
required in the most demanding country in which we operate the particular
process.'
But even if western companies build the cleanest and most advanced plants in
developing countries, their governments may be faced with immense costs in
providing the necessary infrastructure - for example, water and waste
treatment facilities.
'It may become increasingly difficult for developing countries, with little
industrial base, to obtain the technology and related experience that will
be needed to overcome global environmental issues,' Sir Denys says. 'It is
surely here that the role of governments and international organisations
will be crucial in developing the right financial and political climate to
allow technology to be transferred as widely and quickly as possible.'
In other words, there is no point in considering technology transfer on its
own. It must be part of an all-round development programme.
In the end, however, there is something slightly paradoxical about the view
that technology can save the planet, when it is clear that technology
enabled mankind to make such a mess of the earth in the first place. As the
UK-based Intermediate Technology group puts it, 'technological advancement
driven by greed has led to rapacious stripping of the earth's resources and
has fuelled unsustainable lifestyles in the north.'
The IT group believes the Small is Beautiful approach, first expounded 20
years ago by its founder, the late Fritz Schumacher, is more appropriate
today than ever. It argues that the widespread application of small-scale
technical solutions, combining western know-how with local skills and
resources, can make more impact on the Third World environment than
grandiose projects such as large 'clean coal' power stations.
Examples of intermediate technology introduced successfully include
fuel-efficient wood burning stoves in Kenya and Sri Lanka; cleaner metal
extraction equipment for small-scale goldminers in Zimbabwe and roofing
tiles reinforced with local vegetable fibres in many African countries.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (17): Scientist with impeccable
green credentials / Profile of Brazil's Environment Minister
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A NUCLEAR physicist may seem an unlikely choice for Environment Minister,
but Mr Jose Goldemberg's green credentials are impeccable.
One of Brazil's best-known scientists, Mr Goldemberg hit the headlines in
the late 1970s when he came into direct confrontation with government by
opposing the purchase of nuclear reactors under a programme set up with West
Germany in 1975.
Today, charged with conserving the world's largest rainforest, reducing
forest fires, and protecting its 270,000 strong indigenous population from
invasion by wildcat goldminers and loggers, 64-year-old Mr Goldemberg is one
of the longest surviving members of President Collor's government.
Initially appointed as Secretary for Science and Technology he has become Mr
Collor's 'fix-it man,' moving over to head the education ministry at the
beginning of this year after a corruption scandal caused the downfall of his
predecessor, and adding the environment portfolio in April when its
incumbent Jose Lutzenberger, Brazil's leading ecologist, was dismissed.
Mr Goldemberg is already proving his reputation as a practical no-nonsense
man by freeing long delayed money for environmental projects from the World
Bank and Inter-American Development Bank.
He makes no effort to disguise his contempt for what he calls the 'hypocrisy
of the developed world,' particularly when it comes to the Amazon
rainforest, 60 per cent of which is in Brazilian territory.
'We get a lot of advice and very little money - it annoys me tremendously,'
he complains.
As an example he cites debt-for-nature swaps: 'I had a terrible time inside
the government persuading the economy ministry and president to approve the
idea.
'Finally, they agreed to allow up to Dollars 100m, yet to date we've
received offers for only Dollars 6m.' The first Dollars 2m swap was signed
in May this year.
Mr Goldemberg's main hope from the Earth Summit is a convention limiting
emissions: 'I see it as a bargain. Developing countries such as Brazil have
been making strong efforts to cut deforestation and it has been falling ten
per cent a year since 1985.
'We cannot cut emissions because this clashes head on with our need for
development but if we make an effort to decrease the growth of our emissions
the first world should set some targets for reduction of theirs.'
One of Mr. Goldemberg's responsibilities is to harmonise the Brazilian
position for the Rio conference.
His predecessor had considerable difficulties with the Brazilian Foreign
Office over its advocacy of the concept of sustainable development - the
rational economic utilisation of natural resources such as the forest.
Mr Goldemberg believes that outsiders have concentrated too much on stopping
deforestation of the Amazon and too little on sustainable development to
provide a living for its 16m inhabitants.
He warns: 'There's a lot of poetry about sustainable development, but it's a
very tricky thing because it produces a low income.'
Mr Goldemberg is expected to be only a stop-gap minister until after the
Summit and he has no masterplan for the future development of the Amazon.
The Brazilian government is not a Soviet-type government which plans in
detail, he says - 'it's main responsibility is to keep the minimum of law
and order in the Amazon; and the police have enough trouble keeping
transgressors in line.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (12): Man with a global mission -
Profile of Maurice Strong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHATEVER the outcome of the Earth Summit, the fact that it is taking place
at all is due largely to a short, bustling Canadian with a cheerful face:
Maurice Strong.
For the last two years, Maurice Strong, secretary general of the UN
Conference on the Environment and Development (Unced), has roamed the world
from his office in a faded mansion on the outskirts of Geneva, drumming up
support for the event. As preparations reached their climax earlier this
year, he was visiting a different continent almost every day.
Not bad going for someone who recently celebrated his 63rd birthday, writes
David Lascelles.
But Mr Strong has brought a dash of passion to his job - in addition to the
patience and good humour which he has needed to keep things moving,
particularly during the last few months when it looked as if Rio was getting
hopelessly bogged down.
'The environment is not a matter of dealing with a few pollution problems,'
he says. 'We've gone far beyond that. It exposes the underlying
technological malaise of our civilisation. We have not done it deliberately,
but we have lost our innocence.'
For much of his life, Mr Strong was a businessman, holding senior positions
in Petro-Canada and Power Corp. of Canada. In the 1970s he became involved
in the UN's growing environmental efforts. Although he returned briefly to
the private sector after that, he was again drawn into the UN during the
1980s, eventually acquiring the job of organising Rio.
If he imagined that mounting concern about the state of the planet would
make his job easy, this has turned out to be far from the case. As the
preparations exposed ever deeper divisions between the rich and poor, the
greens and industry, governments and lobbyists, Strong was increasingly cast
as a mediator, hunting for points of agreement, soothing, encouraging,
prodding. . .
He had to contend with a rising barrage of scepticism in the media - which
he dealt with by granting hundreds of interviews in which the message
usually boiled down to: 'Yes, there are problems, but we're getting there.'
He has his critics too, particularly in the industrial world where he is
viewed as siding too closely with the interests of poor countries, and
over-simplifying the issues - 'Maurice tends to behave as if the
environmental debate is still the same as in 1970. It has matured a lot
since then,' says a European official.
In his efforts to accommodate as many interests as possible Strong also
allowed the Unced agenda to balloon to an enormous size. When Unced was
asked to produce cost estimates for the global clean-up, it put them at an
astronomical Dollars 625bn a year. With firmer leadership, Strong could have
focussed the Rio agenda more tightly, and avoided accusations of financial
megalomania.
But that is now history. Strong is, needless to say, optimistic about the
outcome. There may be fewer treaties on the signing table than was
originally hoped, there are still big question marks about aid money, and
many of the largest interest groups still fear the Summit will be a sell-out
to their rivals, or a massive anti-climax.
But Strong stresses that Rio was never intended to come up with a complete
environmental rescue plan. What it must mark is 'a credible beginning,' with
forceful arrangements to ensure that the great clean-up, once set in motion,
keeps going.
'I've been around this for a long time. I've seen the evidence. I believe we
are facing an environmental crisis. The planet is more threatened today by
the danger to its life systems than it has ever been by war.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (15): The start of a process -
Summit is 'a unique opportunity,' says Michael Howard
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MICHAEL HOWARD, the UK's new environment minister, claims to have played a
special role in the realisation of the Rio Summit. It was during his recent
trip to Washington that the US agreed to the proposed Convention on Climate
Change which opened the way for President Bush to say he would attend Rio.
Whether or not Mr Howard was the honest broker who brought this about, he
maintains that the compromises made on the convention were well worth it in
order to get the US on board.
'It is very important that the US is going to Rio,' he says. 'All should be
involved in this event.'
Not that Mr Howard has had a chance to build up a track record on the
environment. He only got the job after the Conservatives won the election in
April, having previously held positions in the trade and employment
departments. And he was quickly denounced by the green lobby for engineering
a sell-out over the Climate Convention.
But Mr Howard is prepared to lay considerable store by Rio - 'it is a unique
opportunity which must not be squandered,' he says. Although he hopes to see
'meaningful agreements' signed in Rio, he stresses that 'it is not the end
but the start of a process.'
Efficient arrangements will have to be put in place after the event to
monitor the implementation of the agreements.
As a representative of one of the leading industrial countries, he will be
under pressure in Rio to contribute to the enormous funding requirements of
the Third World to meet environmental targets. But this is one subject on
which he prefers not to comment in detail.
'The UK commitments remain to be seen,' he says. He recalls that the Tories'
election manifesto committed the UK to increasing its aid to the equivalent
of 0.7 per cent of GNP. And his predecessor, Michael Heseltine, pledged that
the UK would make 'new and additional funds' available for Rio. But, as
Michael Howard points out, there was no timetable.
Mr Howard is not alone among environment ministers from the developed world
who are reluctant to show their hands ahead of what are likely to be tough
negotiations over the money. And this heightens the danger that the Rio
Summit will fail to deliver on its promises.
Michael Howard advises people to be cautious in their hopes for the summit -
'if they think it will solve all the problems, they will be disappointed,'
he warns.
'But I hope they have more realistic expectations. This is, after all, the
first attempt to tackle global problems on a world scale.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (14): Cause for concern -
Disappointment among environmental pressure groups
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of environmental pressure groups all round the world have been
closely involved in the preparations for Rio. When the idea of the summit
was first mooted, many of them were delighted that the environment had
finally reached the top of global priorities.
But since then, disenchantment has set in. The succession of compromises and
cutbacks in the agenda have left them with dark forebodings about the
outcome.
A few weeks ago a number of them including Friends of the Earth and
Greenpeace, put out a joint statement saying: 'It appears that the Earth
Summit is failing to meet its challenge and instead moving in the opposite
direction from the path it must forge to save the planet from destruction.
Barring a dramatic change of course, it is heading toward a failure of
historic proportions.'
The World Wide Fund for Nature, the Swiss-based group, is also worried about
the 'lack of political commitment' by participating governments, according
to one of its officials, Gordon Shepherd. Even so, WWF has dispatched nearly
30 experts to Rio to press for more concrete results.
Despite the apocalyptic language, the green groups do have genuine cause for
concern. They are worried at the lack of agreement on measures to stem the
degradation of the global environment and disappointed that they have not
been allowed a more significant role in the preparatory meetings for the
summit.
It was the intention of the Unced organisers that the views of a wide
spectrum of environmental pressure groups should be fed into the
discussions. But Roger Wilson, director of the political division of
Greenpeace International, says it has been 'really tough trying to get
access to the private meetings of the preparatory conferences.'
He says there has been a substantial input of reports by the green
organisations on a number of issues - 'but we are very disappointed at the
lack of delegates' serious concern for the points we have raised.'
There was an unwillingness to discuss some subjects, notably anything to do
with nuclear power and its impact on the environment. He says this was
treated as a 'sacred cow' that was outside the discussions.
Roy Thomson, formerly on Friends of the Earth, has been advising the British
Government delegation to the conference on the role of the
environmentalists.
'In the beginning, hopes were too high, there was too much hyperbole,' he
says. 'So it is not surprising that there has been a progressive lowering of
expectations.'
A consultation process was carried out in Britain by the UK committee of the
United Nations Environment Programme in which many environmental groups
participated. Mr Thomson drew up a report summarising their views.
These included sweeping proposals to solve the problems of world poverty by
additional aid from the industrialised world and a Dollars 5bn programme to
stabilise world population.
Furthermore, there were demands that would mean restraints on economic
growth - an outcome which would be strongly resisted by business
representatives at the conference.
The report urged that demand for goods and services should be constrained
and the UK Government should take a lead among rich nations in lowering the
consumption of resources.
Goods and services should meet 'real needs' rather than satisfying
'generated wants and titillated greed.'
At a more realistic level, the report called for policies to ensure the
conservation of energy and the minimisation of waste.
Many green groups will be disappointed by Rio because it will not provide
full answers to their particular concerns. But Mr Andrew Lees, the campaigns
director of Frieds of the Earth, says the best way to judge its success will
be on the strength of the arrangements for keeping the Rio process going
once the summit is over - 'we have to ensure that governments are
accountable and held to the task,' he says.
SHADES OF GREEN: the environmental movement is a large, often bewildering
assortment of interests and ideologies.  Cambridge Energy Research
Associates, the US consultancy, has created this 'prism' which shows how the
greens cover all parts of the spectrum - from 'no growth' to 'pro-growth'.
In between, lie the greens who advocate a varying balance between growth and
regulation.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (13): Big companies are keen to
look green - The business community is anxious about the  threat of 'green
taxation' and over-regulation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES and JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE business world has mixed feelings about Rio.
A number of large companies which think of themselves as responsible on
green matters are glad to see the state of the planet high on the global
agenda. But many others view Rio with apprehension: could it lead to tougher
green rules and new taxes? Can business' quest for profits be reconciled
with a clean environment?
One man who thinks the answer to that question is yes, and has been prepared
to spend some of his considerable personal fortune to back it up is Mr
Stephan Schmidheiny, a private Swiss businessman who chairs the Business
Council for Sustainable Development.
He argues that business should see the environment in the same light as
research: something you spend money on without the prospect of immediate
gain, but in the hope of securing long term benefits. In this case, the
benefit would be greater efficiency, in addition to whatever moral or public
relations value a company acquires through being green - 'companies should
see this as another opportunity for competitive advantage-gaining.'
Mr Schmidheiny recently published a kind of businessman's green manifesto,
'Changing Course', which argues that business can make a contribution to
solving the world's ecological problems, provided there are free and open
markets, and regulations treat everyone fairly.
The alternative to business' willingness to co-operate would be a draconian
regulatory crackdown which would harm everybody, the book warned.
The business viewpoint will be put at Rio by the International Chamber of
Commerce. The ICC, with members in 112 countries, has drawn up a business
charter for sustainable development which has the backing of 750 leading
companies around the world.
They undertake to recognise environmental management as a high corporate
priority, but they will also be advancing the message that competition must
be free and fair.
Despite the desire of top industrialists to portray themselves as
environmentally concerned, Rio comes at a time of mounting frustration
within the business community over the growing regulatory burden.
Only three weeks before the start of Rio, a survey by Price Waterhouse of
manufacturing companies in the UK's industrial north showed them chafing
under environmental regulations. And in the US President Bush lifted certain
species controls which were obstructing the lumber business.
One of the results that the business community is seeking from Rio is closer
co-operation between governments on environmental matters, so as to ensure
that some countries do not adopt tougher rules than others, and put their
exporters at a disadvantage.
'We need an umbrella being put up at Rio,' says Mr John Collins, the chief
executive of Shell UK, and chairman of the UK government's Advisory
Committee on Business and the Environment. He says Shell is ready for
measures like a carbon tax which might suppress demand for oil, provided it
is applied to all industrial countries.
Although such a tax would hit at Shell's products, Mr Collins says his
company would be ready to reposition itself to supply cleaner fuels - 'we've
already taken that step mentally,' he says. He accepts that governments will
have to make what he calls 'fiscal tweaks' to encourage environmental
shifts. But he also believes that the prices of goods and services must
increasingly reflect the environmental costs in production, use and
disposal.
In Japan, the big corporations have recognised the needs of the environment,
but are now confronting the realities of dealing with it, says Mr Michio
Hashimoto, an expert adviser to Japan's Environment Agency.
Although the financial services industry is less exposed to environmental
issues than industry because it does not process raw materials,
environmental pressures are beginning to make themselves felt there too. A
group of 31 leading European and Japanese banks recently endorsed a UN
accord on sustainable development. The document committed them to pursue
best environmental practice in the management of their own affairs and also
to take account of their clients' environmental risks when assessing them
for loans.
Bankers are worried that they might be made liable for the environmental
infringements of their borrowers.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (9): Difference of perspective -
Third World countries are increasingly reluctant to take advice from
industrialised nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEPHEN FIDLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR DEVELOPING country governments, the industrialised world's new-found
concern for the environment has presented both a threat, and an opportunity.
The threat, as they see it, is that international pressure will be applied
to force them to forego growth by placing restrictions on their ability to
use their own natural resources. Having enjoyed the benefits of economic
growth at great environmental cost, industrialised country governments are
now seen as wanting the third world to forego development in order to
contain further environmental damage.
For some governments, the first world's attempts to interfere with the
environment policies in the third world smack of old-style imperialism.
Moreover, advice is not well-taken from countries whose own environmental
records are poor and whose use of the world's scarce resources is so much
more intensive than the developing countries'.
Dr Lim Keng Yaik, the Malaysian Minister of Primary Industries, says: 'We
feel offended that the whole discussion on the environment in the last few
years has been a finger-pointing exercise centred on countries who are
commercially exploiting their forests.'
The opportunity is that, for the first time in years, the developing world
has discovered it has leverage over the industrialised economies. If rich
countries want the developing countries to take environmental action, the
benefits of which will be widely dispersed, then there will have to be
compensation.
The bill for environmental action will probably be high: according to the UN
secretariat for the Rio conference the extra annual cost in aid from the
rich countries would be Dollars 125bn.
Many developing countries take the position that this should be entirely
additional to current aid budgets. The World Bank has made more modest
costings of an annual Dollars 75bn from the year 2000.
The extra call on the resources of industrialised countries has scared some
governments, particularly the US administration. It has taken the view that
the actual threat to the environment is less critical than has been
depicted. It has seen the aid demands as uncomfortably reminiscent of the
1970s discussion of a new international economic order, a debate it had
considered buried.
Rich-country governments much which developing countries can do for the
environment by opening up their economies to the discipline of market
forces, and by removing incentives for excessive exploitation of natural
resources.
This advice, though, is already being heeded by many third world
governments: they are lowering trade barriers and sharply reducing the role
of state intervention in their economies. Mr Jose Goldemberg, Brazil's
interim environment minister, says the removal by his government of tax
incentives has halved the rate of deforestation in the Amazon to 10,000 sq
km a year.
Moreover, it is precisely because the market fails to account for all the
costs of economic activity that environmental problems have become so acute.
The battle lines between north and south reflect in part their different
perspectives on environmental priorities. In most developed countries of the
north, the main concerns are issues such as carbon dioxide emissions, ozone
depletion, photochemical smog, acid rain, toxic waste and the loss of rare
species.
From a poor country viewpoint, the pressing environmental issues tend to be
smaller in scale and of which the international ramifications are smaller:
water supply and sanitation, soil erosion and desertification, and local air
pollution.
Global warming does indeed imply dangers for people in low-lying poor
countries, such as Bangladesh and Egypt, and threatens the water supplies of
others across the world, but many more people are seen as more immediately
at risk from local environmental problems. The World Bank has estimated
that, for example, 200m people rely for sustenance on shrinking tropical
forests, 1.2bn lack adequate safe water and 1.8bn proper sanitation, and
1.3bn people are exposed to unsafe conditions caused by soot and smoke.
From this perspective, poverty is the threat to the environment and the
solution to poverty is growth. Thus, at least on the face of it, third world
governments put themselves at odds with the many, mostly first world,
environmental pressure groups that see growth as the greatest environmental
threat.
In its 1992 World Development Report, the World Bank describes the idea of a
trade-off between environmental protection and growth as a false dichotomy.
'Without adequate environmental protection, development will be undermined;
without development, environmental protection will fail,' it says.
Developing countries are suspicious of the Global Environmental Facility
(GEF), the fund administered by the World Bank through which developed
countries want to channel their environment-linked aid.
Sensitive to their national sovereignty, they fear that the conditions which
will be imposed on the aid will further increase the rich countries' grip
over them.
As well as finance, they want access - unimpeded by restrictions on
intellectual property - to clean technology; they see themselves as entitled
to some financial flows from holding back on the development of their
forests; and they want to capture some of the economic benefits that may
arise out of the preservation of biodiversity.
For their part, most industrialised countries have thus accepted that the
threat to the global environment is two-fold: spreading poverty in the south
and poorly-regulated industrialisation in the north, although the extent to
which this consensus will be converted into action is still unclear.
In recent months, the debate appears to have become less heated and the
positions less entrenched. The summit will inevitably fall short of what
many environmentalists consider minimum objectives. But a framework should
be be established for the future discussion of a variety of environmental
issues on a global and on a national scale.
More finance will be made available to halt environmental degradation and
the GEF (now with about Dollars 1.3bn in commitments) expanded, and made
more receptive to the concerns of developing countries.
President Fernando Collor of Brazil, the host of the Rio summit, points to
the decision by President Bush to attend the conference, and breakthroughs
made in preparatory meetings over the last few months.
As a result, he says he views the prospects for the conference much more
optimistically than he did a month or two ago.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (11): Business warms to plans for
balanced development - Industry viewpoint / Frank Popoff, president of Dow
Chemical
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDUSTRIALISTS, often viewed as the villains of the environmental war, will
also be gathering in Rio for the summit. But according to Mr Frank Popoff,
president and chief executive of Dow, the US chemicals group, they will be
coming in a non-adversarial role.
'We need to reduce the adversarial relationship that has existed so far  -
then, through mutual effort, we can actually achieve something,' he says.
The summit offers an opportunity for industry to raise its credibility and
demonstrate the many ways it is committed to sustainable development -
balancing economic growth with environmental concerns, he believes.
The minimum that should be achieved is that Agenda 21, an 800-page action
programme which will flesh out the principles in the Rio declaration, should
provide the template for global environmental reform, creating a framework
for minimum pollution and maximum product, Mr Popoff argues.
'By coming together and talking about Agenda 21 we must be less political
and more pragmatic in our approach,' says Mr Popoff. There's no point being
utopian, but we must change course to sustainable development.'
The chemical industry vies with the oil industry in public esteem for being
the least environmentally-friendly, but, according to Mr. Popoff, chemistry
has an important role to play in reducing pollution. Modern pesticides have
been developed, he observes, which require grammes rather than tonnes per
hectare, and are benign, decomposing extremely quickly.
However, he stresses the importance of self-regulation within the industry
as well. and the need for the sector to pre-empt national regulators from
setting up different standards in different countries.
Too many companies still regard waste and emissions reduction as something
they must do to satisfy outside agencies rather than something they can do
to realise economic gain.
Dow has been running a campaign called 'Wrap' - Waste Reduction Always Pays
 -for the last five years, based on the premise that the best approach to
environmental problems is not to produce pollutants in the first place. The
company has also set up a yield improvement programme that searched for ways
of using fewer raw materials and less energy per unit produced.
Dow's policy towards plastics has been driven by the need to control waste.
The company is continually searching for ways to prevent pollution rather
than dealing with it at the end of pipeline; it also aims to reuse plastics
when possible, recycle what cannot be used and then reclaim the energy in
the product.
The principle of sustainable development fits in well with Dow's existing
philosophy, says Mr Popoff. That is why the group has been quick to back the
proposals.
Mr Popoff warns that the price to be paid if the industry fails to regulate
itself is chaos. In particular, if different standards are set up in
different states, then the issue of pollution will become even more
hopelessly intermingled with trade issues. Trade and the environment are
already in a hopeless mess, he says.
The solution to pollution must be based on market principles. The results of
over-regulation and centralisation have been all too clearly demonstrated in
eastern and central Europe.
He believes taxes on consumption are preferable to competing subsidies. One
clear opportunity is to reduce discrepancies in the gasoline sector, where
consumer prices are five times higher in Italy than in the US - 'the US has
been slow to address the issue of gasoline prices,' he says. 'It may be
politically controversial, but by raising prices it would have the great
advantage of reducing inordinate use. We must have a universal gasoline
price.'
Mr Popoff admits such a move would be politically difficult, but the
electorate might well be interested in a politician who put forward such a
fresh view.
One of the most significant problems facing the summit will be that of
reconciling the differing agenda of north and south. The north is interested
in energy consumption, air and water quality, solid waste, and climate. The
south's pre-occupations remain population growth, deforestation,
desertification, water and technology transfer.
'All these things are compatible. The issues are global,' says Mr Popoff.
'We have to work together, because otherwise there are no other real
options.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (10): Conflicting viewpoints -
Industrialised Nations / A big issue for the industrial countries is how
much money they are prepared to advance to help poorer countries clean up
their environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INDUSTRIALISED countries may agree that the world's environment is under
threat, but they differ on the seriousness of the danger and what should be
done about it. Nothing illustrates this better than the reluctance of
President Bush to commit himself to attend Rio until the eleventh hour,
despite the strong urging of his partners in Europe and Japan.
Yet it is the industrialised countries who will be expected by the rest of
the world to take the lead in mounting a clean-up, and in financing the
Third World's efforts to overcome its environmental problems. The strength
of these countries' support will therefore be crucial to the outcome of Rio.
Although the US probably has a longer record of environmental action, the
Europeans displayed greater enthusiasm for the idea of an Earth Summit from
the start. John Major, the UK prime minister was among the first political
leaders to say he would attend.
Europe also had a clear enthusiast in Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC's
passionate Environment Commissioner who was determined that the Community
should put up a united front at Rio, and set a strong example on
environmental matters.
The EC accepted at an early stage that the industrial countries, as the
largest processors of raw materials, had a special responsibility for the
environment. Its members also committed themselves to providing 'new and
additional resources' to finance a clean-up.
But only a week before the summit started, Mr di Meana failed to secure the
support of EC environment ministers for a carbon tax, the keystone of his
strategy to cut pollution. In disgust, he said he would not go to Rio after
all, meaning that the EC will not now speak as one at the event. The US
position is more complex. The imminence of an election made Mr Bush
reluctant to commit himself to the uncertainties of Rio, particularly at a
time of economic recession and growing backlash against the green movement.
Mr William Reilly, the chairman of the Environment Protection Agency, said
during the preparations: 'There are many things about Rio that are not
encouraging,' referring to the proposed treaties that would impose curbs on
industry and seek to change consumption patterns in advanced countries.
The US also made much of the continuing uncertainty in the scientific
community about the dangers of climate change.
In arduous negotiations in the final weeks before Rio, it managed to secure
compromises on the key treaty to limit greenhouse gas emissions. The coming
days will demonstrate whether these were worthwhile in order to obtain US
support.
Mr di Meana was outraged by the compromise and some European Community
members wondered why they should accept a treaty which fell below the
standards they were implementing already.
Japan, which accepts the climate change threat, will support strong measures
to reduce pollution, according to its chief negotiator, Mr Nobutoshi Akao.
A significant issue for the industrial countries is how much money they are
prepared to advance to help poorer countries clean up their environment.
Although they have agreed in principle to grant more aid, they have
studiously avoided putting numbers on it, not least because of the heavy
pressures on their own budgets.
Although Japan is keen to take a high profile at Rio, it will not commit
itself to specific aid ahead of the summit, Mr Akao says.
EC members agreed in the run-up to Rio to pledge 0.7 per cent of GNP, nearly
twice present average aid levels. But though some members wanted to set a
target date of the year 2000, more preferred to leave the timing vague. The
US has not been willing to make a similar pledge.
The expectation is that the rich countries will agree to add up to Dollars
10bn to the Dollars 55bn they already make available each year. But this
would be conditional on most of the money going through the Global
Environment Facility, the three-year-old fund set up by the World Bank
specially to help Third World environmental projects.
Mr David Maclean, the UK's Minister of State for the Environment and the
Countryside, told a Third World conference in Kuala Lumpur: 'The reason is
simple. To persuade our taxpayers to accept new and additional burdens, we
have to be able to point to new commitments and additional global benefits.
The GEF allows us to do just that.'
The World Bank, in its latest World Development Report, is blunt about the
role to be played by the industrial countries: 'Industrial countries must
bear most of the costs of addressing global problems,' it says, 'especially
when the required investments are not in the narrow interests of developing
countries. . .such arrangements have the potential to make all countries
better-off if the world's willingness to pay for policy changes exceeds the
cost of the changes.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (8): Population surge is a
crucial issue - There may well be 10bn people on the earth by the year 2050
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S population is growing at an unprecedented rate, consuming more
resources than ever - nearly a billion people will be added to the planet
during the 1990s, according to the Worldwatch Institute. As the number of
poor people is increasing, human migration is growing and renewable
resources, such as water and land are increasingly under threat.
Such realities make the population issue a crucial one for sustainable
development. There are about 5.5bn people in the world, with an average
annual increase of 97m projected for the coming decade. International
experts agree that population growth rates will have to be reduced, and the
pattern of human activities changed, if ecological catastrophe is to be
averted.
The two go hand-in-hand because it is not simply high population growth
rates that are threatening the environment. Developed countries, with
relatively low birth rates, consume most of the world's resources. A
Bangladeshi, for example, consumes energy equivalent to three barrels of oil
a year, a US citizen 55 barrels.
As Oxfam puts it: 'Industrialised countries generate significantly more
damage per person to the global environment than do people in developing
countries.'
Sustainable development therefore calls for a fairer distribution of the
benefits of development among the world's people.
High population growth rates in developing countries - where 80 per cent of
the world's population lives - will, nevertheless, put even greater pressure
on the world's resources.
The higher the population in developing countries, the higher their energy
use and pollution, especially as economies develop. More water is needed,
more forests are cleared, inappropriate agricultural practices increase and
wildlife species disappear. Population growth in developing countries is
responsible for about 79 per cent of deforestation, 72 per cent of arable
land expansion and 69 per cent of the growth in livestock numbers.
Such problems are further compounded by the increasing migration of people -
to urban areas and to environmentally sensitive inland areas - in search of
productive land and jobs.
Addressing high birth rates means addressing poverty in such countries, say
international agencies. More than 1bn people live in absolute poverty
without adequate food, clothing or housing.
North-South relationships regarding debt, trade, aid and technology transfer
are seen as longer-term means of tackling poverty. Programmes to tackle high
birth rates focus on improving third world health and education, and
providing readily available and affordable family planning.
Practice shows that birth rates can be reduced voluntarily by raising the
status of women through education and providing them with opportunities
other than the traditional child bearing role. It is thought that more than
one in five births in developing countries may be unwanted.
The worst case scenario for the population explosion is that there could be
12.5bn people in the world by 2050 if immediate action is not taken. The
most likely scenario is a figure of 10bn people.
Fertility patterns can change in just one decade. Development and
consumption patterns will have to follow suit, says the United Nations
Population Fund.
'World resources are adequate for the sustained development of the planet -
if they are carefully used,' it warns.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (7): Trade bans unlikely to
succeed - Co-operation is better than coercion in persuading developing
countries to adopt environmentally-friendly policies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE USE of trade bans as a stick with which to bludgeon poor countries into
adopting better environmental policies is unlikely to be effective, and is
probably playing into the hands of protectionists, according to recent
studies from the World Bank and the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.
While free trade is no panacea, co-operation will produce better results
than coercion, says Mr Lawrence Summers, vice-president and chief economist
of the World Bank in a new report on Trade and the Environment. Developing
countries in particular should not be forced to take action they cannot
afford, such as stricter environmental legislation, he argues.
The Gatt and World Bank reports, intended to fuel debate at the Earth Summit
in Rio de Janeiro, acknowledge that the failure to take proper account of
environmental costs has led in some cases to environmental degradation. But
they also argue that blanket harmonisation of environmental regulation,
sought to ensure fair competition between exporters, is inappropriate and
runs counter to accepted principles of international trade.
Trade measures may be justified as environmental policy 'in very narrowly
defined circumstances', they argue. Indeed Lawrence Summers notes that 'in
the case of worldwide problems like global warming or in the case of
regional problems like acid rain, there is no viable alternative to
international co-operation.' But at the same time, he insists that 'there is
almost always a better way of meeting environmental objectives.'
The bank debunks the 'deep ecology' view that environmental assets, such as
rain forests or endangered species, have infinite value, and from this,
argues that countries have a right to decide what value they give to
environmental quality, traded against the need to provide jobs, relieve
poverty, provide proper health care and education.
The reports are also valuable in providing substance to the argument over
whether 'dirty' industries are migrating to countries with lax standards.
They concede that the amount of 'dirty' industry output in developing
countries has grown steadily over the past two decades, but suggest that
this has more to do with the stage of industrialisation of many developing
countries than any other factor.
STUDIES in Chile and more widely across Latin America also contradict the
claims that free trade leads to environmental degradation and that
industries migrating to developing countries seek comparative advantage in
their lower environmental standards.
On the contrary, it is protected markets like those of eastern Europe that
have harboured inefficient companies using pollutive technologies, rather
than open ones.
Several reasons are given for this: companies have become fearful of
liabilities arising in the event of environmental accidents, and are
sensitive to the demands of 'green' consumers in export markets.
They economise by using common production standards in all plants, wherever
they are based, and find it cheaper to start new plants with
state-of-the-art technology rather than face the comparatively expensive
prospect of 'retrofitting' ageing plant. They also have to anticipate that
developing countries will over time demand more stringent environmental
standards.
Evidence drawn from the world timber industry also points to the paradoxical
conclusion that curbs on world trade in tropical hardwood could result in
more forest depletion rather than conservation.
The findings of a World Bank study of the timber industries of Brazil and
Indonesia challenge environmentalists who have fought for a ban on trade as
a main plank in their push to protect the world's forests.
About 60 per cent of forest depletion is due not to trade but farming and
cattle ranching, the study shows, with the balance split between road
building, urbanisation, fuelwood and logging: 'Activities geared to the
domestic market. . .are the main players in the deforestation process.'
The case is vividly illustrated in Brazil, where commercial logging accounts
for less than 1 per cent of GDP, and for under 1 per cent of export
revenues. Of total hardwood logging, 10 per cent goes on to the export
market, the rest being used inside Brazil.
As a result, trade measures against Brazil's exports are useless. They have
no influence on the deforestation process, and they lull environmentalists
into a false sense that progress is being made.
GATT, which polices world trade, and is at the centre of such controversies
as that over whether a trade ban is appropriate on tropical hardwood, argues
above all else that countries should have freedom to decide how to resolve
their environmental problems, and other countries are wrong to use trade
instruments against them if they disagree.
This challenge to the use of extra-territorial sanctions to force 'good'
environmental practices on other countries has aroused anxiety that a lack
of international agreement on environmental standards and practices will
make it a 'pig in the middle' in trade disputes.
The US 'dolphin-tuna' controversy was a first, but others are pending, such
as Swedish and Swiss bans on imports of chickens raised in cages.
The World Bank provides support for Gatt's role: 'Gatt rules can protect
(developing countries) from new forms of protectionism under the guise of
environmental policy, reinforce the respect of sovereignty in trade
relations, and shift emphasis from the use of trade sanctions to
negotiations. The rule-based multilateral system protects the interests of
small countries against power-based unilateral policing by large countries.'
Other ways of pressing countries to change environment policies could
include product labelling and financial or technological transfers: 'Trade
forums seem to be the wrong places to address environmental issues.
'The source of the problems is not in trade, but in the need to (take proper
account of) environmental costs.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (5): A billion people in need -
Fresh water supplies / 'Safe water and sanitation are the foundations for
health, and health is the foundation for global development' - Dr Hiroshi
Nakajima, director general, World Health Organisation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE BILLION people in the world do not have access to safe drinking water;
1.7bn lack basic sanitation. There may be enough fresh water in the world to
meet demand but it tends to be in the wrong place, at the wrong time or of
the wrong quality.
Fresh water is a limited resource. Less than 1 per cent of the world's
supply is actually available for human use, the rest being locked away in
glaciers and polar ice caps. Efficient water management is considered the
best way to protect both the environment and people's livelihoods.
Water management is a multi-objective long-term approach to utilising the
natural resource. It means considering the social and ecological impacts of
water projects; involving local communities at one level, international
cooperation at another. It means addressing such issues as present and
future consumption patterns, waste and pollution, land use and global
warming.
Most of the world's fresh water - in rivers, lakes and swamps - is used in
agricultural irrigation, but up to 80 per cent of it never reaches crops.
Industry uses much less than agriculture, but returns it to its source often
polluted and unfit for consumption.
While domestic use accounts for only 6 per cent of total fresh water
consumption, lack of adequate sanitary facilities contribute to serious
environmental pollution. Most human waste is simply dumped in the nearest
body of flowing water, causing water-borne diseases that kill 25,000 people
a day in developing countries.
Coastal areas are most at risk from the 20bn tonnes of waste which ends up
every year in the sea. Two-thirds of the world's population live within 80
kilometres of the coastline, contributing to and suffering from its
environmental degradation. Marine habitats are destroyed, fishery industries
threatened, recreation, tourism and general economic development
jeopardised.
Man's past and present activities also endanger water resources in less
direct fashion. Deforestation and bad land use practices disturb the
hydrological cycle, making the soil less able to absorb precipitation and
release it over time.
The result is flash flooding and overflooding in delta areas of major rivers
like the Ganges and Mekong, with devastating effects on local populations.
Seasonal droughts follow.
Coastal areas suffer increasingly serious damage from tropical cyclones, as
coral reefs and mangrove swamps are lost to industry. Global warming further
increases the risks of coastal cyclone flooding, while endangering entire
island territories. Rising sea levels in the future could mean unique island
flora and fauna disappear for ever, and with them indigenous people's
traditional homelands.
Perhaps the greatest damage done by man to fresh water resources is the
building of billion dollar dam projects, like those in Egypt and India. More
than 200 large dams are being built annually, and it is estimated that by
the end of the decade 60 per cent of all the world's rivers will be dammed.
Such projects cannot be justified on economic grounds and certainly not on
environmental grounds, says Phil Williams, honorary president of the
International Rivers Network in California. 'We regard the most acute threat
to the river system to be the construction of the these huge water
projects.'
He cites the 'disastrous' effects of the building of Egypt's Aswan Dam on
the Nile River. Its reservoir is becoming clogged with silt, reducing its
useful life span; the river channel is changing; fertility in the sub-plain
soils has declined, while salinisation has increased; there is salt water
intrusion in the estuary, a major area of food production; the shore line is
eroding; fisheries have been destroyed.
IRN would instead like to see local energy and irrigation needs met properly
through small scale electricity generation and capital lending projects for
individual farmers. Energy efficiency programmes and updated technologies
would alone reduce demand many-fold, it says.
Such multi-objective programmes will have to be applied to water management
around the world, say environmental and aid agencies. They have to begin at
local levels, addressing community needs and priorities, using suitable
technologies that are low cost, readily maintained and replaceable.
WaterAid, the UK water charity, works in just this fashion in nine countries
in Africa and Asia. David Collett, director, says: 'Our message to world
leaders is. . .do not allow the environment and development to become
divorced from one another. And do not fall into the trap that the world's
problems can only be solved by international action. We must think globally
to preserve and improve this planet's environment. But action must come at
the local level as well.'
Similar approaches - incorporating cooperation between developed and
developing countries - are recommended for achieving the sustainable
development of agriculture and marine resources. Where seasonal flooding,
cyclones or drought seem inevitable, organisations like Oxfam favour
programmes aimed at helping people cope with such disturbances long-term.
The aim of development agencies is that by the year 2000 each person has
daily access to at least 40 litres of safe water, and that waste is
collected, recycled and/or disposed of in an environmentally sound fashion.
In developed countries, not immune from drought, water tariffs could be
introduced to reflect the marginal costs of raising water infrastructure
standards.
The high seas are seen as a potential model for sustainable resources
management. Marine pollution caused by shipping, waste disposal and
incineration at sea is a grave problem, but the vastness of the oceans has
protected them so far from being seriously polluted.
Environmentalists are looking for a global strategy for managing the high
seas - with legally binding agreements - before it is too late.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (6): Concern for earth's living
wealth - Loss of species is wiping out a medicine chest of potential cures
to serious disease / Dozens of species may be disappearing each day
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERY DAY 'we are losing species we don't even know exist and in one of
which could lie the cure for diseases, such as AIDS,' says Ms Maria de
Lourdes, director of the international department of the Brazilian
environment ministry.
The realisation that destruction of forests was wiping out whole slices of
potentially valuable species has made biodiversity an important issue in
recent years and a crucial part of earth summit discussions.
Biodiversity refers to all the species of animals, plants and microorganisms
in the world as well as their genetic variety and the ecosystems - water,
land or air - in which they live. Known as 'the earth's living wealth,' it
provides an essential supply of food needs and many of our medicines.
Our knowledge of biodiversity is still very incomplete. Around 1.4m species
have been listed of which 751,000 are insects, 41,000 vertebrates and
250,000 plants. Biologists estimate that there at least between five to ten
million species in existence and maybe as many as 100m. Despite today's
concern, biodiversity is continuing to diminish and recent studies suggest
that the world will lose between two and seven per cent of its species over
the next 25 years. If ten million species exist, this means losing a
staggering 20-75 per day.
The Amazon rainforest is the planet's greatest stock of biodiversity.
Although the casual visitor may be disappointed not to see flocks of
colourful parrots, monkeys swinging from tree to tree, and wild animals
jumping out from the bushes, it is home to 20 per cent of all higher plant
species and birds and ten per cent of the world's mammals. In one tree alone
between 100 and 300 species of butterfly can be found and one hectare of the
jungle contains between 100 and 300 species of bird. Popularly thought of as
a homogenous forest, in fact it has 12 distinct ecosystems.
The Amazon River holds 20 per cent of the planet's fresh water and 2,000
species of fish (compared to an average 20 species in European rivers).
Many Amazonian species are being lost or are under threat from human
activities such as logging, flooding for hydroelectric projects,
forest-cutting and burning for cattle pasture, and gold mining, which is
choking rivers with sediment and polluting aquasystems with the mercury used
for gold extraction. Although ranching is the most destructive activity, Mr
Chris Uhl, a biologist from Pennsylvania University says 40 of the 350
timber species currently being harvested by loggers are under threat of
extinction.
Green extremists are in favour of complete conservation, arguing that we
should not destroy anything because we do not know what is there, and are
constantly finding new ways in which biodiversity can contribute to
development such as in new foods and medicines.
But Mr Alfredo Homa, a scientist at the Agricultural Research Institute in
the Amazonian town of Belem, says: 'People say the biggest richness of the
Amazon is its biodiversity and thus all activities such as ranching should
be stopped but while people have not identified species this makes little
sense. It is an untouchable wealth.'
Scientists are now hard at work mapping the biodiversity of the Amazon, but
our precarious knowledge of species and the difficulties of assigning real
values remain a problem.
Mr Marcos Azambuja, Brazil's chief negotiator for the Earth Summit,
describes biodiversity as the most complex issue on the summit agenda: 'We
used to think of the world as divided between useful things, and things that
God created for his pleasure. Now we see that everything may have a purpose
and thus everything must be sacred.'
The major difficulty in agreeing a convention on biodiversity is that most
of the planet's species are concentrated in poor countries while the
technology and knowhow to benefit from them through development of products
are in the hands of developed countries. As naturally-occurring species
currently have no real value, poor countries have no incentive to conserve
them.
In order to maintain their biodiversity, under-developed or developing
countries, such as Brazil, are asking for a transfer of technology and funds
and suggesting that communities where important plants are found should be
given a share of the royalties of the final product.
Mr Azambuja says: 'The idea is to introduce a minimum of order into the
forest - the jungle should not be treated by the law of the jungle.'
Defenders of forest people argue that they should receive royalties because
these people are in fact informal environmental scientists who have
developed a wealth of knowledge of the medicinal properties of plants over
centuries.
But Mr Jose Goldemberg, Brazil's Environment Minister, a nuclear physicist,
argues against this: 'You might find an important cure in a tree - or you
might not. What's important is establishing the link between plants and
cures, and for that we need science, an enormous amount of training and
equipment - and money.
'Finding the herb is a very small part of process which leads to the final
product on sale in the drugstore.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (3): A puzzle of fiendish
complexity - Pollution of the atmospher / Predictions are fraught with
uncertainty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE THREE most serious pollution threats to the world's atmosphere are
global warming, destruction of the ozone layer, and acid rain.
Each would be a fiendishly complex scientific puzzle in its own right. In
fact they interact - making it almost impossible even for the brightest
research groups armed with the most powerful supercomputers to disentangle
the effect of individual pollutants.
For example, much of the industrialised world is cloaked in a man-made haze
of sulphate aerosols - microscopically small droplets and particles that
contribute to acid rain. But, according to the latest scientific evidence,
this is moderating global warming because the particles reflect some
incoming solar radiation back out to space.
Scientists are not even sure about the effect of chlorofluorocarbons on
climate change.
CFCs are undisputed environmental villains because they destroy the ozone
layer in the upper atmosphere, which protects life on earth from the sun's
harmful ultraviolet radiation. They also contribute significantly to global
warming by absorbing solar heat (infra-red radiation). So the international
agreement to phase out CFC production will not only save the ozone layer but
also help to fight the greenhouse effect. Right?
Not necessarily. Recent studies show that the warming effect of CFCs over
the past decade has been counterbalanced by their ozone destruction, because
a thinner ozone layer traps less heat. The scientists concerned emphasise
that their findings are tentative, and even if CFCs turn out to have no net
impact on global warming, it is still vital to phase them out as soon as
possible because life depends on the earth's ozone shield. The example does,
however, illustrate the scientific uncertainties about global warming.
There is no doubt that the greenhouse effect is real, in the sense that
carbon dioxide and other gases in the atmosphere absorb solar heat which
would otherwise be radiated back into space. Human activities have increased
the amount of CO in the atmosphere by about a quarter since 1850, mainly
through burning fossil fuels and to a lesser extent through deforestation.
According to the best estimates, CO represents about 55 per cent of total
man-made additions to the greenhouse effect. Other significant contributors
include CFCs, methane, nitrous oxide and ozone. (Low-level ozone, formed in
a photochemical smog as a result of vehicle emissions, is an environmental
menace - ozone's proper place is in the upper atmosphere.)
Scientists can show that greenhouse gases are accumulating in the
atmosphere. What they cannot prove yet is that global warming is already
happening as a result. Although the past decade has been the warmest
worldwide since meteorologists began keeping reliable weather records in the
1850s - and the average global temperature has risen by 0.5 deg C over the
last century - the current warmth could be due to a natural fluctuation in
the climate, rather than the greenhouse effect. We may have to wait another
10 years before the effects of man-made change stand out unequivocally from
random climatic variations.
However, several different supercomputer models of the global climate
predict a warming of several degrees over the next century, if industrial
activities continue to change the composition of the atmosphere at the
present rate. The average temperature is likely to rise by somewhere between
1.5 deg C and 4.5 deg C if the atmospheric concentration of CO doubles. That
would raise sea levels by something between 30cm and 1m.
The best estimate of the UN-sponsored Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
Change is that the average global temperature will rise by 1 deg C by the
year 2025 and 3 deg C by 2100, if nothing is done to restrain CO emissions.
Sea levels would rise by 6cm per decade - enough to inundate low-lying
countries such as Bangladesh fairly early in the 21st century.
These predictions are fraught with uncertainty, particularly since the
supercomputer models, such as the one at the UK Meteorological Office are
only now being adjusted to take realistic account of the key role played by
clouds and oceans in climate change.
Increasing cloud cover at low levels would reflect more solar radiation back
into space and counteract global warming. 'The uncertainties are large and
all-pervading,' comments Professor Keith Browning, a specialist on clouds at
the Met Office. 'They severely limit the reliability of climate
predictions.'
And the latest evidence suggests that the oceans may absorb heat from the
atmosphere more effectively than climatologists had realised previously. If
so, they could delay the full impact of global warming by several decades.
In Japan, Dr Hajime Akimoto, a director of the National Institute for
Environmental Studies, says: 'The theory of global warming is quite correct.
What we cannot predict is the speed at which it will happen.'
If the climate change is uncertain on a global scale, the regional
variations it will cause in temperature and rainfall are even more
speculative. Some meteorologists believe the British Isles could be one of
the few parts of the world to escape without any warming, because the
exceptional pattern of ocean currents in the North Atlantic would absorb the
extra heat. Conversely, continental interiors such as the great
grain-growing regions of North America might suffer exceptional warming -
with potentially dire consequences for world food supplies.
All the uncertainties about climate change and other consequences of
atmospheric pollution do not mean that the world should postpone measures to
tackle them, scientists say. Most climatologists support vigorous
international action to curb fossil fuel burning; to wait for proof of
global warming would be too late.
Meanwhile, a few imaginative scientists are dreaming up grand 'environmental
engineering' projects to repair some of the damage done to the atmosphere.
The best-known proposal is to seed the southern oceans with iron, a nutrient
that would stimulate marine organisms to grow more vigorously and absorb
more CO from the atmosphere. And a group at the University of California is
investigating a concept to 'close the ozone hole' by injecting thousands of
tons of alkanes (simple hydrocarbon gases such as ethane or propane) into
the stratosphere over Antarctica for about a month every year.
'There are many uncertainties underlying this idea,' the California
scientists admit, but they say the time has come to start thinking seriously
about large-scale technical fixes for the environment.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (4): Dismay over the lack of
agreement - Land and rain forest protection
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HUNT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A central aim of the Rio conference will be to halt the over-exploitation of
the Earth's land surface which has accelerated to meet the needs of industry
and growing populations, writes John Hunt.
Forests have been felled, mineral extraction has scarred the earth and soil
has been poisoned by domestic and toxic waste. Soil erosion and and the
spread of desert conditions - 'desertification' - have been caused by
intensive agriculture and primitive farming and overgrazing.
With the growth of environmental awareness in recent years, tougher national
legislation and international agreements have started to get to grips with
these problems.
It was hoped that the Rio summit would re-inforce this by drawing up an
international set of principles in the Earth Charter and a programme for
action for the next century, in Agenda 21.
But progress has been slow in the preparatory meetings for the summit and
environmental pressure groups have expressed their dismay at the lack of
agreement so far.
They are particularly disappointed at the lack of tough proposals for
protecting the rain forest. This is a central issue in the climate change
debate as forests act as 'sinks' to absorb carbon dioxide, the main
greenhouse gas contributing to global warming. They also protect the genetic
diversity of plant and animal life and provide a home for indigenous
peoples.
It is estimated that half the Earth's original tropical forest has been
destroyed over the centuries and that 11.4m hectares are still felled each
year.
Intensive logging has been the the main cause of deforestation but has been
overtaken by the destruction caused by the 'slash and burn' cultivation
carried out by landless people. Originally it was intended that Rio should
produce a binding international agreement on forest protection but this has
been abandoned in the face of disagreements.
It is now hoped to draw up a set of principles on forestry but here again
there are disagreements. So far, at least six different versions of the
principles have been mulled over and there are still many areas of
controversy. The United States, the European Community and other
industrialised countries still want Rio to be the start of a process for
eventually developing a legally binding convention on forests. But the G77
group of developing countries are cool towards this and see it as a move to
strengthen the influence of northern countries over the south.
There are, however, some concrete proposals in Agenda 21. It urges
co-operation between countries to provide expertise, funds, research and
technology for improved management and sustainable development of the
rainforest. Annual funding for this would be in the region of Dollars 2.5bn
between 1993 and 2000. But industrialised countries would be reluctant to
meet such a huge bill.
Tony Juniper, rainforest campaigner for Friends of the Earth, finds this
depressing. He sees it as no advance on existing international schemes which
have failed to protect destruction of the rainforest.
The problem of waste and its impact on soil is another area of concern. The
Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) says its
members (US, Canada, New Zealand, Australia, Japan and Western European
countries) produce 9bn tonnes of waste a year. This includes 2.5bn tonnes of
industrial waste of which 300m tonnes are hazardous. Much of this is
disposed of in landfill sites where it can lead to build up of methane gas
and pollution of the water supply. Urgent action is required to control the
rapidly growing volume of industrial waste, household garbage and sewage
according to the draft for Agenda 21.
It estimates that the amount of municipal waste worldwide will double by the
end of the century and double again before the year 2025.
Agenda 21 suggests that industrialised countries should have programmes in
place to stabilise or reduce waste and increase recycling by the year 2000.
Developing countries should work towards that goal so long as it does not
jeopardise their development prospects, it says.
An important topic will be desertification and the famine and disease which
it brings. Dry areas covering a third of the Earth's land surface are being
degraded by this process, which is caused by lack of rain, overcultivation,
deforestation and mismanagement of croplands.
Most publicity has concentrated on the Sahel region of West Africa where
drought killed over 50,000 people and millions of heads of cattle in the
1970s. But there are also threatened areas in other parts of Africa, the
Middle East, India, Pakistan, China, Australia, the Russian Federation,
theUS and Latin America.
Agenda 21 proposes that by the year 2010 environmentally sustainable
techniques should be used in agriculture and grazing in dry areas. There
should be better management of water resources, protection of vegetation and
extensive planning of new forests. It wants a system of contingency crop
planning linked to weather forecasts and strategies for importing, storing
and transporting food in emergencies.
The question of sustainable agricultural methods throughout the world and
the means of phasing out intensive and harmful farming and over-grazing will
be considered.
Lester Brown, president of the Worldwatch Institute, the Washington-based
environmental research organisation, says that in the coming decade the
world's farmers face the task of feeding 93m more people every year while
millions of tons of top-soil are being eroded annually. He says that either
loss of top-soil from cropland will have to be checked by effective
conservation or the growth in population will be checked by hunger and
starvation.
The Council for the Protection of Rural England wants a commitment from Rio
to phase out price support and other agricultural incentives which encourage
overfarming.
'Agricultural policy should re-inforce rather than contradict environmental
objectives,' it says.
About 11 per cent of the earth's ice-free land is cultivated, of which 24
per cent is pasture and 31 per cent woodland or forest. Around ten per cent
of the world's population live in mountain regions which have been under
pressure from excessive tourism, soil deterioration and over-cultivation of
marginal lands. Rio will look at ways or preserving the ecological balance
of these areas by the year 2000 by encouraging crop diversification and
village industries. Mining and extraction are regarded by environmentalists
as typically dirty industries. Environmentalists are pressing for an end to
'tax breaks' which encourage mining in the US, Japan and France, but for
more recycling to reduce the amount of minerals that have to be extracted.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (2): Rio is not just one event -
but several - The Summit Agenda
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
APART from the official negotiations involving more than 160 countries,
there will be dozens of gatherings in and around Rio of non-governmental
groups - the green organisations, business groups, and so on - all striving
to influence the outcome.
But the main focus will be on the newly-built Rio Centro conference centre
located 20 miles outside Rio. Here, official delegations meet for 12 days to
hammer out a series of treaties and agreements, culminating in a grand
ceremony involving as many as 60 world leaders, the largest such gathering
in history.
The agenda on the Rio negotiating table is a lot less ambitious than first
hoped, mainly because of the deep disagreements exposed during the
preparations.
For example, a proposed Earth Charter had to be dropped because it tried to
do too much. Instead, there will be a watered down Rio Declaration - a kind
of 'Ten Commandments on the Environment,' except that it will have 27. This
will commit signatories to pursuing sustainable development, and eradicating
poverty.
It will also enshrine the principles of 'polluter pays,' free trade, and
environmental protection, and uphold the rights of women, children and
indigenous peoples. Another key principle is that countries have sovereign
rights to exploit their resources, but an equal responsibility to ensure
that their actions do not harm the environment for others.
The Rio Declaration will be backed up by Agenda 21, an 800-page action
programme which will flesh out the 27 principles. This enormous document
will address all the major issues: land, air, water, living things, as well
as related matters like education, poverty and managing toxic waste.
Participants will also sign two international conventions, or treaties.
The first of these, widely described as the keystone to Rio, will be a World
Climate Convention to promote measures to reduce the greenhouse gases that
threaten to change the world's climate. This does not contain the binding
deadlines originally planned, though the developed countries will agree to
come up with specific plans aimed at reducing greenhouse gas emissions to
their 1990 levels by the year 2000.
The second, a Bio-Diversity Convention, will aim to protect the richness of
the world's plant and animal life, though again critics have claimed that it
is not strong enough, and that the wealthier countries should commit more
resources.
There was to be a third treaty to save the tropical forests, but this proved
too controversial because it implied blame on the part of the Third World
countries in managing their resources. Instead, there will be a Statement of
Principles on Forests which will recognise countries' rights to exploit
their forest resources, but also stress the need for proper forest
management.
Both the conventions will contain pledges of money by the rich countries to
help the poor deal with their environmental problems. But quite how much
money is committed will be the subject of much hard bargaining at the Rio
conference centre.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of The Earth Summit (1): Vast agenda but thin on
action - Few events have captured the world's imagination like the Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro. But few have also given rise to as many
misunderstandings and false hopes
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
WILL this summit be the historic moment when planet Earth finally becomes
environment-minded? Or will it be just another staged political event, rich
in form but bare in substance?
Will it launch a full scale assault on the world's mounting environmental
problems, or will it pass without trace?
Judging by the tortuous two-year preparations for the event, the answer will
certainly not be the first of these. The run-up has been marked by far more
discord than harmony among the dozens of powerful constituencies which are
taking part. As a result, the agenda for the two weeks of talks is huge,
jumbled and decidedly thin on specific plans of action.
So those people who had hoped or expected Rio to mark something of a
watershed in human history may have to brace themselves for disappointment.
On the other hand, the cynics who have denounced Rio as a sham may also come
away unsatisfied. There is no question that the event has focused the minds
of 140 governments on complex environmental questions, stirring up in the
process a lively debate which has sharpened many of the issues. Even if the
dozens of world leaders, who plan to attend Rio, disperse on June 14 without
a detailed action-plan, it would be most surprising if they do not take with
them a sense that the environment has acquired fresh political momentum. And
that may be the yardstick by which Rio's success should be measured.
Mr Maurice Strong, the Canadian businessman-turned-UN official who is the
chief organiser of the event, stresses that Rio is not the culmination of a
movement to save the environment, but it must mark 'a credible beginning.'
Why have a summit at all?
Rio's history goes back 20 years, to 1972 when the UN first put the
environment on the international agenda at the Stockholm conference.
Ten years later, the UN created the World Commission on Environment and
Development, chaired by Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland of Norway, whose 1983
report Our Common Future warned that the current patterns of economic growth
were unsustainable.
Another ten years on, none of these problems has gone away. The world has
become a dirtier, noisier place, parts of the Third World have become
poorer, the pressures on dwindling natural resources have intensified. New
concerns, such as the ozone layer and greenhouse gases, have appeared. But
underlying these particular points are two greater ones, both of which
suggest that the time is ripe for a concerted, global initiative rather than
the national approach which has characterised 'green' action so far.
One is the growing awareness that the problems of pollution are
international: one country's dirt and smoke spills over into another, and
everyone is contributing to the gases and wastes which foul up the planet's
atmosphere and seas.
Heightened popular understanding of the science of ecology also means the
layman now appreciates the links in the world's natural systems: that the
rain forests of Brazil help purify the air over Europe.
The other is the growing influence of the economic theory of sustainable
development: the view that to survive, the planet should only consume that
which it can replace. A tall order in a world that is steadily sucking its
oil wells dry and chopping down its trees, but one with an appealing, if
stark imperative.
One of its tenets is that the true cost of exploiting resources, replacing
them and disposing of the waste will have to be built into prices if the
global economy is to make the necessary adjustment.
But though few people would disagree with this catalogue of problems, Rio
has exposed deep divisions in the world about the scale of the threats,
which of them are most urgent, and what should be done about them.
For example, the industrial countries who account for 80 per cent of the
world's wastes, have proved incapable of putting up the united front they
hoped for in Rio.
The fact is that recession has not helped. There is even an anti-green
backlash in the US where 20 years of mounting environmental regulation is
beginning to be costed in terms of lost jobs and hassle for the consumer.
The result is that there will not, as originally planned, be any binding
timetable in Rio to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. Instead, there will
only be a promise to produce a plan of action by some future date. The
critics have already seized on this as a sign that the world's worst
pollution culprits are not taking Rio seriously. But, maybe, as the
minimalist school argues, this is better than the alternative which is
nothing at all.
Nor can the Third World agree on what it wants from Rio. Are the issues for
its members the protection of the natural resources which it possesses in -
dwindling - abundance?
Or do they centre on the degradation of the environment and the
under-development to which it can usually be traced: the spread of deserts,
the water contamination, the ill-health and poverty?
Third World representatives like to remind people that the official title of
the Earth Summit is the UN Conference on the Environment and Development,
(UNCED). This recognises the closeness of the two topics; it is futile, they
say, to talk of cleaning up the planet without first overcoming the damage
caused by economic backwardness. And it is pointless, if not immoral, of the
industrial countries to demand the protection of the rain forests while
ignoring the plight of people who have to cut down trees just to live.
'The whole question is how to protect the environment and have development,'
says Dr Lim Keng Yaik, Malaysia's minister of primary industries, and one of
the more combative spokesmen for the developing world. 'We have to find an
equation for that.'
The Third World's interest in development has provoked the other big clash
in Rio, between the rich and poor countries over the place that aid should
occupy on the agenda.
Many Third World countries will be attending Rio in the hope of securing
fresh commitments or offers of debt relief. But the industrial countries are
equally determined to prevent the familiar aid debate being dressed up in a
new and fashionable green garb.
Nonetheless, there is clearly a basis for agreement between rich countries
who want to preserve the world's living species and poor countries who say
they will do it provided they are given the financial and technical means.
Mr Michael Heseltine, the UK's former environment secretary, spoke of 'a
bargain' to be struck when he launched the final preparatory meeting for
UNCED in New York in March.
Japan also seems to be gearing itself up to take the initiative - something
it is usually reluctant to do on global issues.
Mr Noboru Takeshita, the former prime minister, who has now embraced the
environmental cause, says: 'Japan can play a bridging role between rich and
poor countries because it has itself escaped from poverty and pollution.'
The main question is how much money the rich countries will be prepared to
give. Despite UNCED's estimates of a requirement for Dollars 125bn a year,
the actual sum is likely to be less than one tenth of that figure. Again,
the critics will give voice, but the minimalists will say it's better than
nothing.
The other central question is what happens after the Summit. If Rio is to be
the start rather than the finish of the process, the strength of the
continuing machinery will be crucial. The participants will sign a Rio
Declaration, a kind of environmental 27 Commandments backed up by a bulky
Agenda 21 action programme. The Declaration is not binding, so the strength
of public opinion will decide how enduring Rio's legacy can be.
Large numbers of people will be disappointed by Rio because it will not
address their particular interest. The greatest danger is that it will leave
a vacuum into which will rush who knows what.
However, it would be surprising if Rio did not set something in motion and
earn a place in the history books, even if its value only becomes apparent
in the next century.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (8): Competitive sector - The
aerospace industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE of the world slowdown in aircraft orders, aerospace is proving
Quebec's most vigorously competitive industrial sector.
Quebec and Ontario each make up 45 per cent of Canada's aerospace industry,
which posted 1991 sales of Dollars 9.4bn, up 12 per cent from 1990.
The balance is spread in the Atlantic provinces and the west. But it is
Bombardier, the Montreal-based international transport equipment group, that
has seized leadership and control of the Canadian industry.
In six years, Bombardier has built itself a big niche in international
markets for about CDollars 320m cash and heavy commitments in new equipment,
partly government-funded.
Mr Laurent Beaudoin, chairman, made the first sortie in 1986, buying the
troubled Canadair from the federal government for CDollars 140m. This was
followed by the acquisitions of Short Brothers, of Belfast (CDollars 58m),
Learjet in Kansas (CDollars 86m) and finally 51 per cent of de Havilland
Canada, Toronto (CDollars 35m cash), in 1992.
Bombardier has meshed all four units into an interdependent group managed by
Canadair in Montreal. Montreal makes the Challenger business jets, the
50-passenger Regional Jet (RJ), defence systems, waterbombers and has big
airframe contracts with Airbus.
'We move quickly, keeping existing management where possible, reorganising
and modernising,' says Mr Beaudoin. 'The key is investment in people and
equipment and defining your markets. This lightning expansion hasn't slowed
our speed of manoeuvre. But we're not interested in British Aerospace's
business jet division.'
Aerospace made up 60 per cent of Bombardier's CDollars 3bn sales last year,
and more of its total CDollars 5.5bn order backlog. Bombardier now makes a
complete range of commercial, business and specialised aircraft in Montreal,
Belfast and Wichita, Kansas. The Montreal operations are approaching the
peak 11,800 payroll Canadair achieved 25 years ago when it turned out
modified Sabre fighters.
It delivered a total 100 aircraft last year and may do better in 1992 as RJ
deliveries begin to Lufthansa's feeder airline. It hopes to leapfrog
Gulfstream with a long-range Global Express business jet adapted from the
RJ. Quebec's total aerospace shipments were more than Dollars 4bn last year,
70 per cent for export.
Direct payroll totals nearly 30,000 after 1,000 recent layoffs at Pratt &amp;
Whitney Canada (PWC), the world's biggest small turbine maker. Research and
development runs to about Dollars 250m a year, partly government-funded;
investment in plant and equipment averages about Dollars 200m.
Because of slower engine orders, PWC has cut manpower at its Montreal
assembly plant to about 7,000, or well below Canadair's. Total 1991 sales
were about Dollars 1.5bn, including turboprop and fanjet engines, parts,
overhaul and maintenance and service operations. But rising revenues from
engine overhauls will cushion the temporary drop in demand for new engines.
CAE Electronics, a world leader in commercial flight simulators, is
recovering from an order downturn after the Gulf war. Annual revenues are
about Dollars 500m, and it is a heavy R&amp;D spender.
Bell Helicopter Textron, with sales of about Dollars 350m, has a new plant
near Mirabel Airport, north of Montreal, specialising in smaller machines.
It has received a Dollars 1bn Canadian military order, ensuring stability
for several years.
Rolls-Royce Canada, with 1991 sales of Dollars 253m, specialises in heavy
jet engine overhaul. It has just won a Dollars 100m contract to maintain
USAir's 88 Rolls-Royce-powered aircraft, and may expand into industrial
engine assembly.
Air Canada operates the country's biggest single engine overhaul shop, with
2,500 employees, in Montreal. Dowty Aerospace builds landing gear for Airbus
jets at a new Dollars 90m plant at Mirabel, and Heroux specialises in
landing gear overhaul and hydraulic systems.
Canadian Marconi is a leader in avionics, Howmet Cercast in castings, FRE
Composite in new materials, and Hochelaga Aerospatiale in machining. Spar
Aerospace conducts most of its satellite communications and remote sensing
research and assembly in Montreal.
Oerlikon, Paramax Electronics and Bendix Avelex are diversifying after a
drop in defence business. Innotech provides custom interiors and refits
business and specialised aircraft. Overall Quebec's materials, component and
services support network is more developed than Ontario's. NMF Canada, part
of Britain's Aviation Tool, is among the latest arrivals in Quebec. The
first customer for its new advanced metal-finishing plant is Canadair - for
finishing RJ wings.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (7): Recession, failures curb
enthusiasm - Financial Services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
QUEBEC led the push for Canadian financial services deregulation in the
early 1980s, but the enthusiasm has since been tempered by recession and
some spectacular corporate failures.
The province was tilting at the four pillars of Canadian financial services
 -banks, trusts, insurance and investment dealing - even before the national
debate on deregulation began in 1985.
Mr Jacques Parizeau, then the province's finance minister, argued for broad
deregulation and more competition, and accused Ottawa of dragging its feet.
The powerful Desjardins credit union group, with Dollars 45bn in assets,
backed him, eager to keep its grip on Quebec's retail banking and to flex
its muscles in corporate lending and other services.
Most Quebec institutions, such as National Bank of Canada and the life
insurance firms, welcomed the idea of new powers and more competition,
stressing an entrepreneurial approach to financial services. Some began
buying sprees. But others such as Industrial-Alliance, the province's
biggest locally-owned insurance group, were more cautious.
Now, Quebec - struggling with recession - finds itself having to adjust not
only to its own deregulation moves, but also changes in the rules for
federally-regulated banks, insurers and trust companies which are expected
to take effect this month.
One insurance executive in Montreal says Quebec's liberal regulatory regime
may have contributed to the recent failure of Cooperants Mutual Life, a
Quebec-based company. The Cooperants failure has prompted a
behind-the-scenes debate on tightening some of the province's insurance
regulations.
The Quebec financial services industry generally feels, however, that the
new federal legislation falls short and that a 'rendezvous with history' may
have been missed, says Mr Claude Forget, senior vice-president of The
Laurentian Group, a full-service institution.
On one hand, Quebec is pleased that the federal reforms level the playing
field among institutions. For example, they will allow banks for the first
time to buy trust and insurance companies, and insurers to buy trusts.
But there are strict conditions on the banks' ability to offer insurance and
fiduciary products. Banks and trusts cannot lease cars and distribute
insurance through their branches - less than Quebec wanted. Banks have been
allowed to buy investment dealers since 1987.
The formation of a national securities commission, a key issue for Quebec,
has been delayed indefinitely. Securities trading is a provincial
jurisdiction. The new 'deregulated' national industry faces a highly complex
federal supervisory system.
The Bank Act has gone from 255 pages to 342 containing 604 sections against
316; the Insurance Act from 173 pages to 406 with 762 sections against 238.
Detailed regulations are yet to come.
'The legislation does break down barriers,' says Mr Forget. But the failures
of two western banks, several Ontario trust companies and Cooperants Life in
Quebec made legislators cautious.
'It strengthens controls of all kinds in trying to achieve financial-sector
security,' Mr Forget says. Regulatory compliance will require elaborate
corporate procedures to track authorisations and restrictions, threatening
lengthy delays. Institutions may not compete effectively from their domestic
bases and controls may create a false sense of security, he says.
While deregulation has been the dominant theme for seven years, Quebec-based
banks, trusts, insurance firms and the diversified Desjardins group have
faced heavy domestic mortgage repossessions and write-offs on sour corporate
loans.
The worst appears to be past for loans within Canada, with the notable
exception of Montreal-based National Bank of Canada's exposure to property
developer Olympia &amp; York.
Deregulation and tough economic conditions are leading to greater financial
services concentration in Quebec. Several independent Quebec securities
firms have disappeared in recent years. The largest brokerage firm in the
province, Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion, is now a National Bank subsidiary.
Meanwhile, some assets of the failed Cooperants insurance group have been
acquired by Desjardins and Industrial-Alliance.
Paying off policyholders may cost the insurance industry well over Dollars
100m via its consumer protection fund.
Quebec property and casualty firms have been under severe margin pressure
for two years, bringing more concentration and new international ties. The
Montreal stock exchange, with almost 100 per cent electronic trading, was
profitable last year and has kept its share of the value of equity trading
in Canada at about 20 per cent. It has scored some successes in developing
its niche derivative products, notably Government of Canada bond futures.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (9): Institution wields a big
stick - Profile of Caisse de depot et placement du Quebec
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CAISSE de depot et placement du Quebec has long prided itself on
speaking softly but carrying a big stick. However, as the resources at its
disposal grow, the institution which manages Quebec's government pension and
insurance funds is starting to turn up the volume, and wield its stick a
little more forcefully.
The caisse's widening influence is visible both in Quebec and far beyond the
province's borders. At home, it has taken a leading role over the past year
in refinancing and reorganising Domtar, the Montreal-based pulp and paper
producer in which it and another Quebec government agency have a combined 42
per cent stake.
Well aware that it contributes more than a tenth of all transactions on the
Montreal stock exchange, the caisse is nudging up its slice of the business
to securities firms which track Quebec-based companies.
However, its most ambitious thrust is on the international front. More than
16 per cent of the caisse's assets, totalling CDollars 41bn, is invested in
foreign bonds and equities. This proportion is likely to grow in coming
years.
Mr Jean-Claude Delorme, the caisse's chairman, says that the caisse wants to
build on the contacts it has gained around the world.
'If we were to stop there, I don't think we'd be getting the full benefit of
our connections,' Mr Delorme says. 'We should use the leverage that the
caisse can muster to bring foreign industrial groups to consider Quebec as
an area to invest.'
The leverage is being wielded in a number of ways. First, the caisse is
moving beyond passive portfolio investments abroad.
For example, last April it spent over CDollars 30m on a 2 per cent interest
in Compagnie Belge de Participations Paribas (Cobepa), a Belgian industrial
and financial holding company.
The caisse has a seat on Cobepa's board, which may help open opportunities
in Europe as well as identify European partners for investment in Quebec.
Cobepa is a minority shareholder in Power Corporation, one of the most
influential players in Quebec business. It has interests in several other
Quebec companies, including DMR, a data processing group; Unigesco, a food
distributor; and United Auto Parts.
At the same time, the caisse is thrusting deeper into the international
property market. It has forged links in the past few months with a number of
foreign institutions which are likely to lead to new investments.
The caisse's growing interests outside Quebec enable it to make a virtue out
of necessity. As Quebec's and Canada's biggest investor, the pressure to
diversify is strong on both commercial and political grounds.
Continuing to find profitable new outlets at home for a rising inflow of
funds has become increasingly difficult.
Not much happens in Canadian business without the caisse knowing. It has
equity stakes in about 350 Canadian companies. Most are minority
shareholdings of less than 10 per cent but in some cases - such as Domtar,
printing and publishing group Quebecor, cable-TV operator Videotron and a
host of small businesses - the caisse's shareholding is large enough to give
it a decisive say.
The bigger it gets in Canada, the more exposed the caisse becomes to
political criticism. Even some of its admirers wonder whether it isn't time
to think of splitting it into a number of smaller units.
Being a shareholder in various companies which compete in the same sector
and in the same country has raised questions about conflicts of interest.
Concerns on this score could grow as the caisse, like other institutional
shareholders, takes a more active interest in the management of companies in
which it invests.
Mr Delorme, an articulate lawyer who headed Canada's overseas telephone
company prior to joining the caisse two years ago, has no qualms about size.
Measured internationally, he says, the caisse is not large. Where there is a
threat of conflicts of interest, investments are divided up among different
portfolio managers. The caisse, Mr Delorme insists, is usually trying to do
no more than 'assist companies to do what they think is good for their own
future'.
Nonetheless, Mr Delorme believes there is room for closer liaison between
shareholders and corporate management. Although he eschews the kind of
shareholder activism recently seen in the US, he sees the caisse as more
than a passive investors.
The best way to solve a company's problems, he notes, is not necessarily to
sell the shares.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (5): The power utility is
fighting back - Profile of Hydro-Quebec
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE past few years have not been kind to Hydro-Quebec, North America's third
biggest power utility.
Recession has slowed growth in demand for electricity, two successive
winters of low snowfall have reduced generating capacity at hydro-electric
dams, a heavy construction programme has forced up Hydro-Quebec's
electricity rates faster than the rate of inflation.
To cap it all, this bastion of Quebec pride has found itself on the
defensive in an intense battle with environmentalists and the province's own
aboriginal community over the enormous hydro-electric scheme which it plans
to build on the Great Whale river flowing into Hudson Bay.
The New York Power Authority, which was to be the lead customer for the
electricity from Great Whale, cancelled its CDollars 17bn contract with
Hydro-Quebec earlier this year.
It's a matter of debate whether the NYPA was swayed by the environmental
protests or simply by the recession's impact on its customers' appetite for
electricity.
But there is no doubt that the decision has set back Hydro-Quebec's plans to
stitch together one of the world's biggest hydro-electric grids in northern
Quebec.
Mr Richard Drouin, the utility's amiable chairman, acknowledges the problems
of the past, as well as the challenges which remain.
He is confident some of the pressures will ease over the next few years.
Hydro-Quebec had a glimmer of welcome news in the first quarter, with an 8.1
per cent rise in electricity sales thanks to an unusually cold winter, a new
export contract in New England, and the small matter of an extra leap-year
day in February.
In the longer term, Mr Drouin predicts that the competition hydro-electric
power has faced from cheap, clean natural gas will wane when consumers
discover that gas prices can go up as sharply as they go down.
He adds that as the utility's construction programme slows down in the
mid-1990s, price increases could drop to, or even below, the overall
inflation rate.
Finally, Mr Drouin has no hesitation in predicting that the New York Power
Authority will be back in the market for hydro-electric power from Quebec
before long.
'We're not trying to get the whole New York market,' he says.
'We're only trying to get one-thirtieth of it.'
Hydro-Quebec has always insisted that none of its new projects are driven
entirely by export contracts. While Great Whale will no longer be needed to
supply power to New York in 1998 as originally planned, the utility still
plans to press ahead with the CDollars 12bn project once a thorough
environmental assessment by the federal and provincial governments is
complete.
It expects construction to start towards the end of next year, with the
first generating station being commissioned around the turn of the century.
The second and third phases will probably be postponed. They are tentatively
scheduled for completion in 2007 and 2008, five years later than planned.
Lengthy environmental reviews may delay two other northern Quebec projects,
known as Eastmain-1 and Laforge-2.
Although Great Whale is on a more distant horizon, Hydro-Quebec still has
its hands full with projects on the La Grande River, about 150 miles to the
south.
Four generating stations, with a capacity of almost MW4,700, are scheduled
for completion by 1995, largely to meet demand from new aluminium smelters
along the St Lawrence River.
In an effort to spread its risks, Hydro-Quebec has begun encouraging
co-generation projects, mostly in partnership with local pulp and paper
mills.
It aims to buy up to MW750 of power from co-generation plants by 1996, and
is sifting through a pile of applications from potential suppliers.
The busy construction programme requires heavy borrowing on both domestic
and international capital markets. Mr Michel Labonte, vice-president for
finance, estimates the utility's borrowing needs, including refinancings, at
CDollars 4.5bn this year, CDollars 3bn in 1993 and CDollars 4.5bn in 1994.
The utility is leaving few stones unturned in its efforts to tap outside
sources of finance. In April, it became the first buyer outside the aircraft
industry to finance new equipment, in this case four gas turbines, through a
US Ownership Foreign Sales Corporation.
These deals are a complex form of lease, driven mainly by tax advantages for
investors.
Hydro-Quebec completed its first global bond issue last year. It made its
debut in the Euro-French franc market last March, and has become
increasingly active in the US medium-term note market.
It expects to expand its commercial paper programme to about CDollars 500m
by the end of this year.
Mr Drouin says that contrary to some press reports, the cancellation of the
New York contract will not affect Hydro-Quebec's ability to service its US
dollar debt.
The new aluminium smelters, which will be Hydro-Quebec's biggest new
customers in 1992 and 1993, will pay for their electricity in US dollars.
'We don't feel threatened at all, currency-wise,' Mr Labonte says.
Nonetheless, the row over the NYPA contract has taught Hydro-Quebec some
lessons it won't easily forget. 'It made us more aware that in the 1990s
there were people around us who could affect our operations, and that we
should be more aggressive than passive,' says Mr Drouin.

MONTREAL feels a dash of nostalgia for the Expo 67 World Fair. It casts a
glance of envy at Seville's Expo 92 as Montreal celebrates its 350th
birthday party this year.
Expo 67 marked the pinnacle of Montreal's achievements. Francophones,
Anglophones and more recent immigrants worked together to build an
international exhibition on a clump of small islands in the St Lawrence
river.
The federal government and the other provinces chipped in generously, with
only one or two scrooges. It was a rare national effort. After that it
seemed Montreal, with its multilingual services, large inland seaport and
two commercial airports, proximity to New York and Boston, Toronto and
Chicago, might host several international organisations, including part of
Unesco. But little happened.
Over the next 25 years, Montreal and its 3m inhabitants struggled through
recessions, two world energy crises, the increase of separatism, an exodus
of 100,000 Anglophones and a divisive constitutional debate. The current
recession has been the worst since the 1930s and there is no free spending
for the 350th birthday party. Nonetheless, the city retains its grace and
insouciance, and its inhabitants have not lost their sense of humour.
Satire continues to prosper in Montreal, and the city stages an annual
Festival of Laughs besides international film and jazz festivals.
Montreal, still feeling snubbed by the hauteur of Quebec City, the
provincial capital, realises it urgently needs an international vocation, if
only to express its growing ethnic mix - 70 per cent Francophones with the
rest Anglophones and immigrants. In spite of the financial burden of Dollars
1bn-worth of debt from the 1976 Olympics, the city has expanded its cultural
heritage, restored the waterfront and the Old City and extended its museums
and theatres.
It has come to terms with the age of skyscrapers and insists on variety and
renewal, while adjusting to the post-industrial revolution.
Montreal's population fell behind that of Toronto in the late 1950s and may
yet be overtaken by fast-growing Vancouver. But it is still a gateway from
Europe and is North America's most European big city. Its hotels and
restaurants are among the continent's best, and winter and summer sports are
just an hour away.
Founding Montreal on a 35-mile-long island in the St Lawrence system was
called la folle entreprise. A French tax collector believed God wanted him
to build a hospital inside a mission. Some rich French families put up
money, the story goes, and soldier Paul de Chomedey, Sieur de Maisonneuve,
landed at Quebec in 1641 with a clutch of settlers. They set out for
Montreal Island the next spring, and De Maisonneuve swore he would found a
colony 'were every tree on the island changed to an Iroquois'.
They built their first stockade on the waterfront, later moving to higher
ground near today's Place d'Armes and the old Sulpician seminary. Soon
Montreal was a centre of the fur trade. The French voyageurs and explorers
left from there to build their network of trading posts and probe North
America as far as the Rockies and to Mexico.
With the conquest, the French were cut off from France, and Scottish
merchants soon moved in and prospered from successive waves of immigration.
By 1845, Montreal's population numbered 50,000, and it was Canada's
import-export centre. The new railroads fanned out west from Montreal, and
Canadian Pacific was formed in the city in 1880.
Montreal's three great growth periods were 1850-60, 1900-11 and 1950-61, but
two world wars forced the pace of industrialisation and liberalised the
social structure. Though the job is not completed, Montreal's rebuilt
waterfront and Old City, with its stone buildings and cobbled streets, is a
charming place to stroll in spring and summer.
The St Lawrence is fast-flowing as it turns slightly and continues 1,000
miles to the Atlantic. Montreal vies with Baltimore as the eastern
seaboard's second biggest container port.
Old Montreal includes many buildings from the French period, including the
Grey Nuns' first hospital, and the Bonsecours Chapel. The Old City is
connected with the new and the suburbs by a 65-station 45-mile rubber-tyred
Metro.
The Olympic Stadium needs a new roof but boasts a Swiss-built funicular
running up the 600 ft tower. The Place des Arts, containing the main concert
hall and several theatres, has been modernised and expanded, and the Musee
d'Art Contemporain added alongside.
Montreal's four universities have many cultural facilities. The Canadian
Centre for Architecture, the brainchild of a daughter of Mr Sam Bronfman,
the liquor magnate, is a mecca for architects throughout the world.
The Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, with a general collection and which
specialises in international exhibitions, last year opened a controversial
addition designed by Mr Moshe Safdie.
The rebuilt McCord Museum, owned by McGill University, specialises in
ethnology and Canadian history. Montreal's Circus School has just burst on
to the international scene, providing the performers for Le Cirque du
Soleil, an acrobatic extravaganza performing in North America and in Europe.
Montreal may have lost power and influence, but it has a rich historical and
cultural heritage and a strong will to survive and grow again.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (3): Positive business
culture is a silver lining - The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GUSTO with which the people of Montreal celebrated the city's 350th
birthday last month can be interpreted either as a sign of Quebec's
eagerness for some distraction from the tough times of the past few years,
or its confidence that the worst is behind it.
Together with neighbouring Ontario, Quebec has borne the brunt of the
downturn in the Canadian economy. Output shrank by about 2 per cent last
year, after barely rising in 1990.
Several of the province's biggest companies, including the construction
group Lavalin and retailers Provigo and Steinberg, have experienced severe
financial problems. Canadian Pacific, the venerable railway and resource
conglomerate based in Montreal, lost CDollars 40m in the first three months
of this year.
Quebec's unemployment has climbed to 12 per cent and Montreal is reputed to
have one of the highest rates in North America. Problems of high interest
rates and a strong currency were exacerbated by Quebec's relatively heavy
exposure to industries which were hit by the cyclical slump in demand and
also suffered from more deep-rooted structural handicaps.
The impact of the separatist campaign is unclear. But it has certainly not
encouraged local businesses to invest, nor has it helped attract capital
from elsewhere. Royal Bank of Canada said in a recent report that political
uncertainty 'will constrain investment growth' in the province. The chief
executive of a large insurance group in Montreal added that his company was
unlikely to make any substantial new property commitments in the province
until the political picture was clearer.
If there is a silver lining to the political turmoil, it is the positive
business culture which continues to make Quebec one of Canada's most
hospitable provinces to both domestic and foreign companies. While captains
of commerce and industry in Ontario are harshly critical of their province's
fiscal and labour policies, premier Robert Bourassa's Liberal government in
Quebec has a comfortable relationship with the business community.
Quebec was among the loudest cheerleaders in Canada for the 1989 free trade
agreement with the US. Although recession and mounting competition from US
suppliers have taken some of the shine off free trade, Quebec generally
supports Ottawa's participation in the talks with Mexico to create a North
American free trade area.
Quebec is the first of Canada's 10 provinces to grasp the nettle of aligning
its provincial sales tax with the new (but highly unpopular) federal Goods
and Services Tax. Although the harmonisation has short-term political risks,
it greatly simplifies tax-paying companies' paperwork.
The macroeconomic picture has improved markedly in recent months. Canadian
banks' prime lending rates are below 8 per cent compared to a peak of 14.75
per cent in mid-1990.
The Canadian dollar, whose level is closely watched by such export-dependent
industries as forestry and mining, has tumbled by almost 10 per cent since
last November.
With the US buying almost three-quarters of Quebec's exports, the upturn
south of the border will give an added lift to business.
National Bank of Canada, whose head office is in Montreal, forecasts that
Quebec's growth rate will accelerate from 1.5 per cent in real terms this
year to 3.5 per cent in 1993.
Household spending is expected to be a mainspring of the recovery, as
consumers go shopping with the savings from lower mortgage payments.
National Bank forecasts a 3.5 per cent rise in retail sales this year,
accelerating to 5.5 per cent in 1993. Tourism should get help this year from
Montreal's birthday celebrations.
Like their counterparts in the rest of Canada, many Quebec business leaders
are painfully aware that more favourable interest and exchange rates may not
be sufficient to guarantee another burst of prosperity.
The postponement of the CDollars 12bn Great Whale hydro-electric project
means the construction and engineering sector will recover more slowly than
hoped.
Fixed investment as a whole is likely to stagnate for some time as work on
new aluminium smelters is completed, and the government winds down
construction of sewage treatment stations. In the longer term, the drive
towards freer trade has exposed inefficiencies in such cornerstones of the
Quebec economy as forestry, dairy farming and the textile industry.
Canadian pulp and paper exporters have steadily lost market share in the US
to lower-cost producers elsewhere. Likewise, unemployment in the textile and
clothing sector, which is centred in Quebec, has soared as uncompetitive
companies are forced to slim down or close down.
Quebec's inefficient but politically powerful dairy farmers are threatened
by growing pressure (mostly from Canada's international trading partners,
but also from domestic food processors and consumers) on a raft of
protective quotas and other non-tariff barriers.
Although the cost in unemployment has been painfully high, the recession has
forced workers in many industries to moderate their pay demands, while
suppliers have come under pressure to hold down prices. Canada's annualised
inflation rate has dropped below 2 per cent
In addition, Quebec's trade unions have generally been more willing than
their counterparts in other parts of the country to reopen labour contracts
and accept management demands for more flexible work practices. The ability
to build on recent productivity improvements is likely to distinguish the
next generation of Quebec business winners from its has-beens.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (4): Cornerstone of economic
development in the 1990s - Pharmaceuticals thrives in Montreal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GIBBENS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WESTERN suburbs of Montreal illustrate the turnround in the Quebec
pharmaceuticals industry - from decline in the early 1980s to a cornerstone
of economic development in the 1990s.
Hoffman-La Roche, Canadian arm of the Swiss multinational, built extensive
new research and manufacturing space in pastoral Vaudreuil. The multi-storey
tower and five-storey building alongside were designed for the 21st century.
But in 1969, the federal government introduced compulsory licensing for
imported products and reduced basic patent protection for brand-name
medicines to four years.
The company never moved into its space-age facilities. Nor did an
American-based concern which had built a new research lab in the same area.
Hoffman-La Roche moved its Canadian head office to Ontario and its Canadian
research facilities to the US. It waited several years to sell its Vaudreuil
venture.
The brand-name companies maintained that patent protection had been reduced
to the clear advantage of generic producers in the name of lower drug
prices. They warned that the compulsory licensing system would not work for
Canada or Quebec. The exodus continued. By the early 1980s, Ayerst, McKenna
&amp; Harrison closed its Montreal laboratory, merging it into the parent's US
research operations. A few enterprising researchers stayed put, however.
With Canadian financial backing, one group founded a new company
specialising in products for treating diseases of the immune system and
cancer and viral diseases.
Six-year-old BioChem Pharma has yet to show an operating profit but it
boasts a market valuation of CDollars 1bn. It is Glaxo's Canadian partner in
developing anti-Aids drugs. A big change came in 1987 when Ottawa bowed to
pressure from the multinationals and agreed to extend patent protection to
seven years, in return for promises of sizeable investment in Canada.
The same western suburbs of Montreal now display the results of the
investment spree that followed. Nearly Dollars 500m has been invested by
brand-name international and domestic companies in new research,
laboratories and production plants in Quebec since then.
Montreal has become the undisputed centre of Canada's pharmaceutical
industry. Merck Frosst Canada, Burroughs Wellcome, Bristol-Myers Squibb
Pharmaceutical Group and BioChem Pharma are among those which led the way.
Now the Federal Government plans to extend patent protection further in line
with international practice and end compulsory licensing.
'We want the government to adopt legislation placing Canada on a level
playing field with the major industrial nations for protection of
pharmaceutical products,' says Mr Michael Carnow, president of Merck Frosst
Canada. 'This will enable Canada and Quebec to compete for investment.'
He said Gatt deadlines for agreement on patent protection have slipped and
Canada should move unilaterally to ensure Canadian-based companies can
compete. 'This will lead to more research and capital investment.' Merck
Frosst has begun engineering work on a big manufacturing expansion in
Montreal. The new plant will be geared to specific products for
international markets.
The company's Canadian research budget is CDollars 270m for 1991-95,
including a new Dollars 70m research centre opened last September. Colin
Mallet, president of Sandoz Canada, says the investment spree should
continue. He predicts that hundreds of new research and production jobs will
be created in Quebec and Canada this decade if conditions are favourable.
The Quebec government is likely to work hard to ensure that the bulk of the
new investment comes to the province. Pharmaceuticals represent one of
Quebec's three most important competitive industrial clusters, employing
more than 2,000 researchers and planning investment of up to Dollars 1.5b
this decade.
Almost half the total Canadian pharmaceutical industry and more than half
its annual Dollars 300m research effort are now located in Quebec.
The province has four university faculties of medicine, two pharmacology
faculties, an array of specialised bodies such as the Montreal Clinical
Research, Biotechnology Research and the Heart and Cancer Institutes.
Research is also carried out at Laval University in Quebec City.
The Quebec industry's activities range from basic, applied and clinical
research to biotech engineering. Production includes fine chemicals,
pharmaceutic and therapeutic products, vaccines, biological and diagnostic
products. In 1990, the Quebec industry invested Dollars 126m in research, up
28 per cent from 1989, and the 1991 total was higher. It also includes some
generic producers, though these have congregated mainly in Ontario.
The federal government is now considering extending the patent protection
period to 20 years after application or equivalent to about 10 years in the
market place. 'With the population ageing, the industry will play a more
crucial role in the economy,' says Mr Mallet. 'We're all moving towards
longer protection, partly because testing lasts longer and is more complex.
We must provide an environment fostering competition with other industrial
countries in scientific expertise and patent protection.
'The dice are still loaded against Canada now because its local market is
lost to generic manufacturers after only seven years. Canadian firms and
researchers must be given a fighting chance.'
Generic producers have reacted strongly to suggestions that patent
protection will be extended significantly. Mr Barry Sherman, president of
Apotex, Toronto, one of Canada's two biggest generic drug makers, said the
government has capitulated to US pressure. Apotex is not going ahead with
plans for a Dollars 50m extension to its Winnipeg plant.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Survey of Investment in Quebec (2): Clusters hold key to
markets - Industry
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GERALD TREMBLAY, Quebec's industry minister, stands behind his desk
energetically spreading a sheaf of brightly coloured charts in front of him,
like a croupier dealing baccarat cards,
These are the road maps, he explains, to Quebec's latest initiative to draw
government, business, labour and academia together in a concerted industrial
strategy. 'Can you manage a company without a business plan?' Mr Tremblay,
who has an MBA from Harvard University, asks rhetorically. 'Why should a
government be different?'
Each diagram, with a complex pattern of lilac, orange and pink boxes (some
of the boxes are multi-coloured) represents one of 13 industrial clusters.
These are the sectors which Quebec believes have the best chance of being
competitive in world markets.
The aim is to encourage manufacturers in these industries to co-operate
closely with suppliers, government, trade unions, university researchers and
with each other, to create efficient and technologically advanced
industries.
Corporatism has been a cornerstone of Quebec economic policy for the past 30
years. Contracts for Hydro-Quebec's big James Bay power projects put muscle
into the Quebec engineering and construction industries.
Government direction and financial support have helped attract
pharmaceutical and aerospace companies to the province.
Getting everyone to pull in the same direction has been relatively easy in a
province with a tightly-knit, homogeneous population. There is far more job
hopping between the senior ranks of business and government in Quebec than
in other parts of Canada.
However, implementing a far-reaching industrial strategy is less simple than
it used to be. The ability of the government to use financial support as a
tool of its industrial policy is constrained by its CDollars 4bn budget
deficit.
Furthermore, Hydro-Quebec's construction programme will slow down sharply in
the second half of the decade, forcing many local companies to look
elsewhere for contracts.
Mr Pierre Fournier, research director at Levesque Beaubien Geoffrion,
Quebec's leading securities firm, predicts the government will be able to
give little more than moral support to the new industrial cluster concept.
'I like it, but it's going to take a long time,' Mr Fournier says.
The 13 clusters fall into two groups. Five sectors - aerospace,
pharmaceuticals, information technology products, power generating equipment
and metal processing - are well-established both in domestic and
international markets.
According to Mr Paul Lussier, director of investment services in the
ministry of industry and commerce, Quebec has reached a point where 'no
major pharmaceutical company does anything in North America without
considering Quebec as an option.
'If we could do that in five or six sectors, we'd be in great shape'.
The second group includes transport equipment, petrochemicals,
agri-business, textiles and clothing, forestry, housing, environmental
products, and cultural industries.
Several of these sectors have faced severe competitive pressures in recent
years, and will need a shake-up if they are to fulfil the hopes being placed
in them. Their inclusion as clusters is partly a recognition of the
province's natural resources and of these sectors vital importance to
regional development.
Each group of industries has set up a task force to identify its strengths
and weaknesses. In addition, the province's 16 regions have been asked to
submit a cluster wish-list within the next few months.
Mr Tremblay sees the government's role as a catalyst. 'It's a big puzzle and
we put all the pieces together,' he says. For example, vigorous arm-twisting
by Quebec has persuaded the federal government to locate a new Canadian
space agency in Montreal. A forestry technology centre has moved from Ottawa
to Quebec City.
Among the products of collaboration with business taking shape is an
institute for pharmaceutical research in Montreal. Twenty-one brand-name and
generic drug makers have each contributed CDollars 100,000.
The federal and provincial governments have chipped in another CDollars 6m
between them.
In spite of budget constraints, some government money is available for
individual companies too. Since 1987, the government has provided over 1,000
businesses with CDollars 519m in loans. While the loans are repayable, the
terms are generous.
Principal repayments on a modernisation loan, for example, normally start
only in the seventh year.
Numerous tax incentives are available. Research and development expenses
enjoy tax credits of up to 40 per cent. But in an effort to nudge academics
towards practical research, the credits are doubled for R&amp;D undertaken in
partnership with a university.
Foreign investment is an important part of Quebec's industrial strategy. US,
European and Asian companies have large stakes in many of the 13 clusters,
as well as other parts of the economy. Two of South Korea's biggest North
American investments are in Quebec, in the form of a Hyundai car plant in
the eastern townships and a Sami Steel factory in Montreal.
Much of the emphasis in the years ahead will be on attracting more Asian
capital. The government has just opened a trade and investment office in
Vancouver, with a mandate to try and divert to Quebec some of the money
flowing into Canada's western provinces from Hong Kong, Taiwan and
Singapore.

POLITICAL TURMOIL has always been among the least troubling concerns for
anyone doing business in Canada, but not this year.
The question whether this vast country will remain in one piece and, even if
it does, how it will in future be governed, is worrying business people and
politicians alike. The ups and downs of the currency and bond markets in
Toronto and Montreal are explained these days as much by the mood in the
hothouse of constitution-writing as by the latest GDP or CPI numbers.
At the centre of Canada's latest and most searing identity crisis is
French-speaking Quebec - as it has been at almost every period of stress in
the Canadian federation for the past 125 years.
The linguistic and cultural divide between Canada's 'two solitudes' has
opened a similar rift on economic and political issues between the 6.5m
Quebecers (about four in five of whom are French-speaking) and their 20m
English-speaking countrymen.
As their horizons have broadened over the past 30 years, Quebecers have
gained confidence in their ability to be maitres chez nous (masters of our
own house).
At the same time, however, the insecurity that comes from trying to sustain
a distinct culture in North America makes Quebecers nervous of compromise,
especially with Canada's nine other provinces.
A hard-core group of separatists, supported by about 20 per cent of
Quebecers, has found a wider audience over the past two years for their
dream of a quasi-independent state. A sovereign Quebec, so the nationalists
argue, would not only guarantee a secure future for the French language and
culture in North America, but could generally run its affairs without the
inefficient interference of Ottawa or the other provinces.
Events over the past two years have provided fertile ground for the dreams
of the separatist Parti Quebecois. A rash of petty anti-French incidents in
other parts of Canada, most memorably a group of elderly bigots in rural
Ontario stomping over a Quebec flag, played into the hands of the
separatists. So did the collapse in June 1990 of the Meech Lake accord,
which would have given Quebec a number of extra powers and recognised its
distinct identity, in exchange for its signature on the 1982 Canadian
constitution.
Besides feeling rejected by the rest of the country, many Quebecers had
ample reason in 1990 to believe that the cost of going it alone would be
easy to bear. Buoyed by the successes of a new generation of assertive
French-speaking entrepreneurs, the corporatist state of Quebec Inc. was
riding high. No other Canadian province was more enthusiastic about the 1989
US-Canada free trade agreement.
Quebecers were assured that their economy was as big and robust as Austria's
or Denmark's. Often more at home with Americans than with English-speaking
Canadians, Quebecers assumed that the economic costs of a break with Canada
could be compensated for by closer links with the US.
Yet although by late 1990 and through much of 1991 a clear majority of
Quebecers was tilting towards some form of independence, the pendulum has
recently started to swing in the other direction, and much of the enthusiasm
for a break-up has dissipated. Quebec is set to hold a referendum on its
political future by the end of October. Whether the question will invite an
outright yes or no to sovereignty, or whether it will merely gauge support
for proposals from the rest of Canada for a new constitution, there is a
growing sense that Canada will survive in one piece - at least for the time
being.
A split, if it does happen, is less likely to be caused by any hell-bent
desire for independence on the part of Quebec, than by regional jealousies
in other parts of the country, especially the western province of Alberta.
Canada, including Quebec, is still sadly lacking in politicians bold enough
to put the national interest ahead of their narrow, regional biases.
In fairness, the recent turnaround in public opinion within Quebec does owe
almost as much to cooler heads in the rest of the country as it does to
disenchantment with separatism. The separatists' cause has been damaged,
too, by political and economic developments, some of their own making.
With the exception of neighbouring Ontario, Quebec has been hit harder by
the recession than any other part of Canada. Unemployment in the province is
now above 12 per cent, and is likely to stay in double digits for some time.
Forestry and mining, two cornerstones of the provincial economy, are
struggling to overcome not only a worldwide drop in commodity prices, but
also their own high costs.
The province's vulnerability to forces beyond its control was underlined
last March, when the New York Power Authority cancelled a CDollars 17bn
electricity contract with Hydro-Quebec, the huge government-owned power
utility. The cancellation means, at best, a two-year delay on the next stage
of the world's biggest hydro-electric scheme on the rivers flowing into
Hudson Bay.
Meanwhile, federalist business leaders in Quebec, both English and
French-speaking, are becoming more outspoken in warning of the costs of a
split. 'No one is suggesting for one minute that the battle is won,' says
one prominent Montreal businessman. 'But things are definitely going in the
right direction.'
Although the separatists can draw on innumerable studies to claim that an
independent Quebec would not be much worse off, they have had difficulty
demonstrating that a break from Canada would bring tangible benefits.
Federalists, on the other hand, can tick off a long list of likely costs,
from the loss of federal civil-service jobs to the possibility that Quebec
would have to renegotiate the free trade agreement with the US, and the
threat of ugly border disputes with Canada and with Quebec's own aboriginal
people.
The separatists have weakened their own cause by trying to have it both
ways. Mr Jacques Parizeau, the Parti Quebecois leader, has suggested for
instance that an independent Quebec would want to retain the Canadian
dollar. Banks already report a stream of inquiries from Quebecers worried
that their savings might suddenly be converted into a new - and probably
weaker - currency.
Mr Brian Mulroney, Canada's prime minister and himself a bilingual Quebecer,
has seized on such fears to warn that Canada is not a 'buffet' from which
they can pick and choose.
There is a growing realisation on all sides that independence negotiations
would be a messy, and probably nasty, business. The message of the bloody
break-ups of Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union has not been lost on Quebec,
or, for that matter, on the rest of Canada. The separatists' cause was
further hurt in early May by political scandal. Mr Claude Morin, one of most
senior ministers in the Parti Quebecois government in the late 1970s,
admitted that he was a paid mole for the Royal Canadian Mounted Police.
Some of the credit for Quebecers' new willingness to strike a deal with the
rest of the country belongs to Mr Robert Bourassa, the province's premier
since 1985. Mr Bourassa is one of Canada's most shrewd politicians. One
foreign diplomat likens him to a crab: 'He keeps moving sideways, but always
seems to get to where he wants to go.'
After years of Delphic comments on his own attitude towards independence, Mr
Bourassa and his ministers have recently made some gentle gestures towards
the rest of the country. Quebec has signalled a softer line, for instance,
on its French-only language laws, notably Bill 178, which requires
French-only signs on buildings, store-fronts and billboards. Mr Bourassa's
decision in 1987 to override a Supreme Court ruling against Bill 178, was a
milestone in souring English-speaking Canadians' mood towards Quebec.
Fatigue with the interminable constitutional wrangle has itself improved
prospects for a settlement later this year, but the risk is that a solution
produced by compromise instead of leadership will be unwieldy, and thus not
very durable. In response to Quebec's demands, whatever deal is put together
will include a transfer of powers - notably worker training and culture -
from an already weak federal government to the increasingly assertive
provinces. Western and Atlantic provinces are likely to burden the
parliamentary process with new checks and balances, notably a more powerful
Senate, consisting for the first time of elected members.
A Quebec comedian once quipped that 'what Quebecers want is an independent
Quebec within a strong and united Canada'. It would be a sad irony if, after
all these years of soul-searching and negotiating, they ended up with
neither.

FT  02 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE START of the new account did little to generate activity on the
derivative markets, and both traded options and stock index futures on the
whole experienced a quiet session, writes Joel Kibazo.
In stock index futures, the June contract on the FT-SE openned at 2,706 but
was quickly sold by independent traders sending it the 2,700 level, where it
traded in a tight range of about 15 points for most of the session.
The weakness in the sterling and the gilts markets added to the lack of
interest in the futures, as did the poor opening on Wall Street during the
afternoon.
However, a burst of activity shortly before the close as James Capel went on
a buying spree, lifted June out of the doldrums, and it eventually closed at
2,709, around 7 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash which
has dropped to 6 for this account. Volume at 4,021 was very poor.
Turnover in traded options was also poor, with only 19,723 contracts dealt
by the close. The FT-SE option traded a meagre 5,575 lots. Midland Bank, in
which its bidder HSBC has increased its stake, was the most active stock
option trading a total of 2,273 contracts. The June 420 calls were the
busiest series. This was followed by Lasmo, in which 1,108 lots were traded.

FT  02 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy activity in Racal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, JOEL KIBAZO and STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The unwinding of a big stock overhang and some determined buying by at least
two of the market's most influential securities houses helped Racal
Electronics shares to improve on exceptionally heavy turnover.
Racal ended the session 1 1/2 higher at 63p with turnover reaching 27m
shares, the heaviest since the placing of Williams Holdings' near 10 per
cent stake in the group on April 29. Electronics specialists said a large
stock overhang, of around 7.5m shares, had finally been cleared and the
market was now concentrating on Racal's preliminary figures, scheduled for
June 10, and details of the demerger of Chubb, Racal's security locks and
alarms business.
It was said that after the demerger both companies will emerge as bid
targets. County NatWest and SG Warburg Securities have both been strong
supporters of Racal. County put a demerged valuation of 75p a share on
Racal.
Fisons advance
Speculation of a bidder for part of Fisons plus talk that a big US
investment bank was buying stock in the market helped shares in the
pharmaceuticals group to rise sharply. Fisons was the biggest percentage
gainer in the FT-SE 100 index with a jump of 13 to 363p on turnover of 1.3m
shares.
The share responded to a Sunday newspaper report suggesting retail chemist
Boots might bid for Fisons' consumer healthcare business. Boots, which is
expected to announce annual profits of around Pounds 365m on Thursday was
weak earlier but closed 2 better at 484p. A number of analysts said they
anticipated the sale of the consumer division some time this year. One said
there were several possible buyers and Boots was one of them although it was
'not renowned for paying above the odds'.
Firmness in the US and enthusiasm in the UK helped some pharmaceuticals
stocks, particularly SmithKline Beecham, which gained 10 to 925.
SmithKline lifted on talk that agency broker James Capel had published a buy
recommendation on the stock and realisation that the company's anti-nausea
drug, Kytril, was doing well in France. The shares, a third of which are
held in the US in the form of American Depositary Receipts, also benefited
from a stronger dollar.
Tightly-traded Reckitt &amp; Colman was helped by a technical squeeze with some
pointing to an agency cross. The shares picked up 10 to 650p on turnover of
2.7m shares.
Smith &amp; Nephew slipped 3 to 150p reflecting disappointment over an
anticipated sale. The group said the proposed sale of its Solpak generic
drugs division in the US for Dollars 19m (Pounds 10.5m) to Ivax had fallen
through.
USM-listed research group ML Laboratories jumped 60 to 958p. The group is
awaiting a product licence for a kidney dialysis substitute, but analysts
said the company was not hinting at any imminent news and the leap in the
share price was probably prompted by technical reasons. Seventy five per
cent of the shares are held by one trust and, consequently, they move
sharply on very little volume.
Wellcome was weak as the market reacted to news that US rival Bristol Myers
Squibb was seeking expanded use for its anti-aids drugs Videx, a direct
competitor to Wellcome's Retrovir. The shares fell 8 to 972p.
Midland Bank, up 4 to 421, was among the front runners in a generally firm
banks sector, and easily outpaced the wider market, after news that Hongkong
&amp; Shanghai Banking (HSBC), via its broker James Capel, had moved into the
market last Friday and purchased a block of 5m Midland shares at 415p. The
purchase saw HSBC's stake in Midland increased to 15.225 per cent.
NatWest Bank attracted keen support after a broker's profits upgrading, the
shares closing 6 firmer at 358p. Lloyds Bank, given a push by the banks team
at Smith New Court, edged up 3 to 439p.
The Scottish banks moved in opposite directions, with one broker said to be
recommending a switch between the two stocks. Royal Bank of Scotland,
increasingly viewed as a takeover candidate, edged ahead to 199p after heavy
turnover of 4.7m shares, but Bank of Scotland slipped 2 to 116p.
Vodafone, shaken last week by the relatively low valuations inferred by the
merger of Centel and Sprint, two US telecoms groups, continued to suffer
from international selling, the shares dipping 10 to 374p on heavy turnover
of 6m. Vodafone is scheduled to announce preliminary figures on June 9.
Although restrained by the weakness of the UK and US stock markets, the oil
sector continued to attract some good international support as crude oil
prices moved up to their best levels for around six months.
BP and Shell eased 1 1/2 and 2 to 272p and 512p respectively albeit in
rather thin trading. And the Wytch Farm participants were not harmed by
valuations put on the 17.5 per cent holding in the oil field to be auctioned
off by Atlantic Richfield (Arco). There were suggestions in the market
yesterday that some of the utilities, notably the power generators, could
well be interested in acquiring Arco's stake.
Asda remained firm at 33 1/2 p with one analyst saying investors were
beginning to wake up to the beneficial effects of the flotation of the MFI
furniture store chain which is expected to reduce the retailer's heavy debts
by at least Pounds 75m.
Discount retailer Amber Day rose 6 1/2 to 64p on a turnover of 950,000
shares following rumours of a possible takeover bid for the company.
British Aerospace eased 3 to 350p, as turnover reached 1.3m shares. There
was talk in the market that the company will announce 600 redundancies, from
its satellite division, today.
Takeover speculation was also heard in Thomas Cowie, whose shares rose 3 to
162p.
Bid candidate Dowty shed 5 to 173p, to fall below the the 175p cash
alternative offered by its predator TI, 3 lighter at 682.
In hotels and leisures, Forte closed 4 lighter at 235p after a Smith New
Court profits downgrading. The broker reduced its current-year forecast by
Pounds 13m to Pounds 112m, the following year's by a hefty Pounds 28m.

FT  02 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equities give ground as account opens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURNOVER in equities fell away in London yesterday as the new two-week
trading account opened on a flat note. The FT-SE Index quickly lost the
2,700 mark and the downward trend steepened briefly after Wall Street opened
lower when news of a sharp rise in the US Purchasing Management Index
discouraged hopes of an early easing in Federal Reserve credit policy.
Traders sounded unperturbed, however, by yesterday's loss of 10 points on
the Footsie, about half of which reflected nothing more than ex dividend
adjustments to a batch of leading blue chip stocks. The FT-SE Index closed
at 2,697.6, with chart analysts suggesting that 2,675 could be the next
testing level. The international scene remained quiet, with sterling showing
little change against the D-mark. Multinational stocks moved in response to
sector influences rather than wider currency implications.
Seaq volume fell to 425.3m shares, compared to Friday's 520.7m. Yesterday's
Seaq total was believed to include a programme trade carried out by a
leading UK institutional broking house which, as has become the convention,
made its move in the stock index futures market early in the trading
session.
The London market appeared to be moving into a period of relative calm. This
week promises no scheduled important economic or company announcements, and
traders believe that any further shocks from the Canary Wharf property
collapse are largely discounted in the stock market. However, the dangers of
further setbacks in property groups continued to hover over the sector and,
also, to hold back those UK clearing banks known to be heavily exposed in
London.
Dealers reported some signs that fund managers were continuing to back away
from the retailing and consumer stocks, which stood out in the market's
post-election advance, and moving towards stocks considered to be 'safe
earners', such as the utilities. US investors again sought out
pharmaceutical stocks, reversing their policies of the earlier months of
this year.
But equity business was not heavy enough yesterday to provide a genuine test
of institutional attitudes. At Nikko Europe, Mr Peter Thorne expressed a
widely-held view in saying that he expects the London market to consolidate
around its current level 'for the next few weeks'. He sees the short-term
outlook as unsettled by worries over the pace of economic recovery, leaving
the London market good value on a one-year view.
However, in its latest broad-based review, James Capel Economics has trimmed
back its growth forecast for the UK economy in 1992 from 1.9 per cent to 1.3
per cent. It comments that the fall in output in the first quarter of the
year was larger than expected and that the early data for the second quarter
has also been disappointing.
Carr Kitcat &amp; Aitken also predicts further 'sideways movement' in equities,
unless the Wall Street market shows a more positive sentiment. It believes
that a shortage of stock in the market is beginning to be corrected.

FT  02 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei average loses 1.9
per cent on arbitrage selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices lost ground in light trading and the Nikkei average, which rose
initially on the stronger yen, finally declined by 1.9 per cent on
arbitrage-related selling, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average closed down 343.64 at 18,004.11, after a high of
18,502.61 and a low of 18,003.31. The yen's strength and higher bond prices
encouraged a rise in the stock futures market, but the Nikkei plunged on
arbitrage unwinding in the afternoon.
Volume fell to 180m shares from 240m. Traders said institutions, which
believe that the Nikkei will fall to the 17,000 level again, are unwilling
to chase share prices up at the higher levels.
Declines led advances by 650 to 303 with 161 unchanged and the Topix index
of all first section stocks fell 15.78 to 1,360.54; in London, the
ISE/Nikkei 50 index rose 2.04 to 1,077.37.
The Bank of Japan continued its dollar selling intervention in the foreign
exchange market, and the US currency closed down Y1.55 against the yen,
falling below Y127 for the first time since February.
The strength in the yen boosted hopes of lower interest rates, encouraging
buying in the stock futures market. However, market participants, unwilling
to hold long positions ahead of next week's June futures expiry unwound
positions. Mr Chris Newton at James Capel added that the cash market failed
to react to the yen's strength, as currency moves were already discounted
into share prices last week.
Bio-technology related, speculative issues rose on short-term dealer
trading. Nippon Mining, the most active issue of the day, rose Y9 to Y478
and Meiji Milk Products advanced Y1 to Y913.
Housing companies gained on the rise in April housing starts, the first
year-on-year rise in 18 months. Taisei Prefab gained Y30 to Y2,400 and
National House Industrial rose Y30 to Y1,690.
Steel companies were hit by poor earnings results and weak forecasts for the
current year. The top five steel makers posted double digit declines in
pre-tax profits for the past fiscal year, and expect current year pre-tax
profits to decline sharply due to weak demand and higher production costs.
Nippon Steel fell Y4 to Y299 and NKK dropped Y1 to Y284.
Car companies were also sold on earnings concerns. Nissan Motor, which
announced a 47 per cent fall in pre-tax profits for the year ended March,
lost Y15 to Y617, and Toyota Motor fell Y10 to Y1,500.
In Osaka, the OSE average lost 45.50 to 20,832.38 in volume of 14.3m shares.
Roundup
THE fall on Toyko had a negative impact on most of the region yesterday. New
Zealand was closed for a public holiday.
HONG KONG saw early gains eroded by selling of blue chips in the afternoon
and the Hang Seng index closed 24.15 lower at 6,056.00. Turnover was
HKDollars 5.1bn.
Cheung Kong was the most active stock, gaining 50 cents at HKDollars 27.20
while Hutchison Whampoa put on 10 cents to HKDollars 20.00.
SEOUL weakened on selling of bank and securities shares. The composite index
shed 5.01 to 569.19 in turnover of Won240.5bn. Shares in Hyundai companies
fell to their lower limits.
TAIWAN lost ground in thin trade as sentiment was upset by worries that the
central bank may tighten money market liquidity. The weighted index fell
39.73 to 4,456.85 in turnover of TDollars 16.6bn.
KUALA LUMPUR declined in the absence of fresh news. The composite index shed
3.76 to 585.33. Tenaga lost 25 cents to MDollars 8.25 while Malaysian
Airline declined 15 cents to MDollars 5.65 after last week's announcement of
a rights issue.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index closed 3.9 lower at 1,674.4 in turnover of
ADollars 169.8m.
Banks continued to weaken after recent poor results: Westpac slipped 4 cents
to ADollars 3.46 while ANZ lost 8 cents to ADollars 4.17 as investors
reacted to its exposure to India's securities market scandal.
BANGKOK improved on reports that an interim prime minister will be appointed
soon to oversee constitutional amendments. The SET Index closed up 10.06 at
698.90 in turnover of Bt3.2bn.
MANILA slipped back with the composite index closing down 11.53 to 1,387.92
in combined turnover of 187.3m pesos.
SINGAPORE fell on profit-taking. The Straits Times Industrial index lost
14.17 to 1,510.52 in turnover of SDollars 101m.
BOMBAY recovered from early weakness, amid rumours that more banks face
trouble in the current securities scandal, to end mixed on institutional
buying. After going as low as 2,928 the BSE index closed only 5 lower at
3,001.

FT  02 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Referendum poll switch lifts Copenhagen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM COCHRANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Holidays in the UK and Europe took some of the initiative out of equity
markets last week, but gentle rises in the US and Japan combined to leave
the FT-Actuaries World Index up by 0.4 per cent.
The best gains came from Denmark in Europe, and Singapore and Hong Kong in
the Pacific Basin, all with domestic stimuli but all, too, seeing the effect
of foreign buying.
Denmark, says Mr Ole Witte of Bikuben, the stockbrokers, moved as polls
ahead of today's Danish referendum on the Maastricht treaty on European
union switched from a 41:39 ratio of 'No' votes at the beginning of the
week, through a similar balance in favour in mid-week to a 43:37 'Yes'
indication last Saturday.
Going into Europe has always been perceived as a very good thing from an
economic point of view, says Mr Witte. He adds that it was mainly blue
chips, like Sophus Berendsen, Dansico and Novo which led last week's gains.
Singapore led the week on suggestions of a 0.25 per cent cut in prime rate,
says Mr Mike Franklin of Kim Eng Securities. This did not happen but there
was a perception that the economy was improving and that, in any case, the
market had lagged too far behind Hong Kong.
The rise was not too discriminating. Singapore Airlines climbed on results
at the low end of expectations and Keppel, apparently, went ex-rights
without seeing the share price adjustment that this would normally bring.
'Allegedly,' says Mr Franklin, 'there were some big program deals going on
in the market, set up by big US institutions which could see the US economic
recovery coming through to Far East economies.'
There were indications, too, of US involvement in Hong Kong, where domestic
confidence was lifted by two major deals - Hongkong Land's sale of 9, Ice
House Street and Hutchison's privatisation of Cavendish - going through at
good prices.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Weather worries spark surge in
US grain prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GRAIN FUTURES prices shot up in Chicago yesterday as concerns about weather
gripped traders. In late morning trading at the Chicago Board of Trade the
July contract, the spot month, for soyabeans jumped 17 cents to Dollars 6.31
a bushel, wheat climbed 8.5 cents to Dollars 3.58 and maize rose 4.5 cents
to Dollars 2.64.
'It's pure weather,' said Mr Steve Bruce, grains analyst for the big Chicago
trading house of Geldermann. 'They're not going up on nearby demand, it's
going up on concern about the crop. The trade is very weather sensitive.'
Differing weather patterns in the midwest's and south-western growing states
were affecting crops in various manners. But the overall effects appeared
negative for crop harvests and growing conditions.
Heavy rains were pounding certain Plains states, such as Oklahoma, where it
was believed that harvests of soft red winter wheat could have suffered
damage. Spurring further concern in the wheat market, the Kansas Farm Bureau
reduced its estimate of the 1992 wheat crop by 20m bushels because of last
week's frost damage.
Meanwhile, in the northern Midwest, particularly in Illinois, persistent
dryness was touching off worries that there would be damage to the newly
planted crops of soyabeans and maize.
The National Weather Service and other long-term forecasters have been
predicting hot, dry weather for June and July. Illinois has already recorded
its driest May on record.
The weight of the weather forecasting has sent large commodities funds into
the grain pits to buy, speculating that prices are likely to rise further.
The spate of fund buying 'has fuelled the fire' on prices, said Mr Bruce.

THE EUROPEAN Community, in an attempt to placate Canada, said yesterday it
would suspend fishing in waters just outside Canadian territorial waters,
reports Reuter from Brussels.
Canada says EC fleets fishing in the Grand Banks off Newfoundland are partly
to blame for a drastic depletion of its fish stocks.
The European Commission said that it had 'decided to stop the main fishing
activities of the EC fleet in the zone administered by the North-West
Atlantic Fisheries Organisation'.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Enthusiastic response to French utility
FFr3bn issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ACTIVITY in the Eurobond market picked up yesterday, and is expected to
remain buoyant throughout the week, with several new issues likely to emerge
in a stronger Ecu bond market.
Among yesterday's offerings, Electricite de France, the French electricity
utility, launched a FFr3bn issue due 2022, marking a further extension of
the Euro-French franc yield curve from 20 to 30 years.
A month ago, Caisse Autonome de Refinancement, the French government-owned
agency, launched the first issue of 20-year bonds in the Euro-French franc
bond market. Outside the government bond market, the longest duration
available prior to the CAR deal was 15 years in the domestic market and 13
years in the Eurobond market.
The EDF deal, arranged by Paribas, was rapidly sold out, repeating the
success of the CAR transaction. Demand was concentrated among international
institutions, which are currently bullish on both the French bond market and
currency. Insurance companies, which like to match assets to long-dated
liabilities, were particularly active buyers.
In addition, the rarity of 30-year paper boosted demand. Dealers noted the
spread for 12-year EDF paper is a basis point or two wider than the launch
spread of 36 basis points above the 30-year OAT offered by EDF's 30-year
deal.
For French borrowers which require long-dated funding, the long end of the
yield curve has obvious attractions, since the yield curve is virtually flat
from 10 years to 30 years, so they can extend maturity without paying a
higher yield.
In the Ecu sector, Mobil Oil Canada launched an Ecu125m five-year deal via
Credit Suisse First Boston, targetted at retail investors. The deal is
intended to catch an expected surge of demand for Ecu bonds this week, if
the Danes vote in today's referendum to ratify the treaty on European
monetary union signed at Maastricht by European government leaders last
December. The Ecu bond market rallied as much as half a point at the end of
last week, as signs that Danes would vote for ratification relieved some of
the political concerns which have been dogging the market.
A number of borrowers are preparing transactions, on expectations of a
positive result for the market. France Telecom is planning an Ecu300-Ecu350m
10-year deal, while Caisse Nationale des Autoroutes is considering a
nine-year deal of similar size.
Two Swedish borrowers, Electrolux, the manufacturing company, and Spintab,
the Swedish mortgage subsidiary of Swedbank, tapped the dollar sector.
Electrolux brought a Dollars 150m five-year deal via Lehman Brothers, while
Spintab launched a Dollars 300m five-year deal, due to be priced today, via
JP Morgan. The Swedish National Housing Corporation (SBAB) is also rumoured
to be preparing a dollar transaction.
In the D-Mark sector, Finland added a further DM1bn tranche to its DM1bn
10-year deal launched a fortnight ago via Deutsche Bank. Although Finland
has been a regular borrower in the sector, previous deals have been much
smaller.
Finland's growing financing needs - its borrowing programme is Dollars
10bn-Dollars 12bn this year - have encouraged a greater focus on markets
where a distinct investor base exists. While many institutions which buy Ecu
and dollars are rather full up on the name, German institutional demand
remains firmer.
The first securitisation of aircraft leases, by the Irish leasing company
GPA, is close to completion. The Dollars 522m deal, arranged by Citicorp, is
due to be launched next week, providing a satisfactory credit rating from
Standard &amp; Poor's has been secured.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Hong Kong groups lift their
eyes across the border - Developers are making the most of pro-China fervour
by building land banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON DAVIES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER years of playing down China connections to a nervous investing public,
Hong Kong listed companies are suddenly announcing a mass of property
developments across the border to cash in on current pro-China fervour.
With the evolution of Shenzhen from sleepy Chinese town to chaotic
metropolis in the past 12 years, the city's property market has already
begun to resemble neighbouring Hong Kong's. Last year, it was even more
profitable, with Shenzhen residential property prices estimated to have
risen by 80 per cent.
The potential for further development throughout the rest of Guangdong
Province - which is where Shenzhen is situated - has not gone unnoticed, and
this year countless listed companies have announced agreements on plots of
land.
These are mostly companies with little expertise in property development,
and it sounds like a recipe for disaster.
Even in the speculative environment of Hong Kong, property developers are
saying the market has become 'too hot'. There is almost no limit to the
supply of new land over the border.
More than 100m sq ft of land has been snapped up by Hong Kong parties
already. That is substantially greater than the colony's total land mass.
But with an increasingly affluent population of 60m in the province of
Guangdong, there is undoubted potential. It is just a question of timing.
The leading Hong Kong parfar are Sun Hung Kai Properties, New World
Development, Henderson Land, Sino Land and Tian An.
Of these, only Tian An can truly claim to be a China specialist, with all
its earnings coming from Chinese property. Its patchy earnings record in its
five years as a China property stock exemplifies the risks inherent in the
business. But its 1991 price-earnings ratio of more than 100 indicates the
level of expectations.
The other sizeable developers appear happy to limit their exposure, and
China land banks remain insignificant in the context of their overall asset
values.
Sino Land has a China land bank of 2.5m sq ft and is planning to increase
this to 10m sq ft by the end of the year, but its financial exposure will
remain minimal.
Mr Robert Ng, managing director of Sino, said the potential for China was
enormous, but he admitted that in many areas the ratio of cost to purchasing
power was far less favourable than Hong Kong. 'You may get small hiccups
here and there, but in the long run it will be very positive,' he said.
New World Development has been more ambitious. It is estimated the company's
China land bank will exceed 50m sq ft by the end of 1992. Analysts do not
expect any meaningful contribution from China before 1995.
The leading property developers all have sufficient Hong Kong land banks to
carry them through to 1997. Given the limited supply of land in the colony,
it is a logical step for them to build up cheap entitlements in China for
the long term; they can then wait for the market to mature.
For the smaller companies with narrower earnings schedules, the urgency for
completion is greater and they are forced to brave the fledgling market.
These manufacturing companies are often investing as much as their entire
market capitalisation in China property, so the stakes are high. And there
is significant competition.
At present, Hong Kong is the source of most demand. New properties on the
Hong Kong side of the border cannot be bought for less than Dollars HK2,000
(USDollars 258) per sq ft. In Shenzhen, even after the recent price
explosion, prices are half that.
Analysts estimate that at least 60 per cent of units available for sale in
Guangdong Province last year were sold to overseas Chinese buying holiday
homes and flats. Special licences are necessary for overseas buyers, but
these are easily circumvented.
It is impossible to tell what will happen when this pent-up demand is
satisfied since at present the mainland Chinese have very limited access to
mortgage financing.
Developers have to face up to a chaotic system for obtaining planning
permission. Henderson Land claims that only 40 per cent of the projects it
has negotiated are likely to be completed and successful projects progress
very slowly.
'Developers say that for every official stamp there is a bribe of as much as
HKDollars 200,000. And you need around 20 stamps,' said an analyst at Credit
Lyonnais Securities.
Most Hong Kong companies link with a joint venture partner which provides
the land and pushes through the paperwork, while the foreigner pays for the
construction. Often the China partner fails to obtain good title for the
land.
Contacts are crucial, which is why manufacturing companies are in the
forefront of the property boom. The industrialists have already built up
connections in setting up their factories in the Pearl River delta.
The shortage of regulations in China has one large advantage: a Hong Kong
developer can pre-sell units before it starts work, thereby raising the bulk
of the funds required to complete the project. But this obviously depends on
the continuing strength of the market.
'The key is timing, location and linking up with the right partner,' said a
developer. The crunch will be felt three years from now, when the proposed
developments finally become reality.
'I think it is going to take a lot more projects for the bubble to finally
burst,' said Mr Peter Churchouse, vice-president at Salomon Brothers. There
are few statistics to show how great the supply will be, but it seems only a
matter of time before that point is reached.

<TEXT>
ABN AMRO, the largest bank in the Netherlands, yesterday completed its
acquisition of the European operations of Hoare Govett, the UK stockbroker,
from Security Pacific of the US.
Hoare Govett also said yesterday that it is to eliminate another 35 jobs,
reducing its workforce to 345. The latest job losses, which are roughly
divided between front and back office staff, follow the cutting of 60 jobs
in January.
Terms of the deal, which was first announced in February, were not
disclosed. The transaction does not include Hoare Govett's Asian operations.
The UK stockbroker was put up for sale last year after Security Pacific
merged with Bank of America to form BankAmerica Corp.
ABN Amro said Hoare Govett would enable it to penetrate the large UK market
for corporate and institutional clients, an area where the Dutch bank was
under-represent-ed.
Mr Peter Meinertzhagen, chairman of Hoare Govett, said: 'The acquisition
gives the company immediate access to Europe and ABN Amro's extensive
capital resources.'

UNION Bank of Switzerland has called in the Mountleigh Finance 5 1/4 per

UBS said it had acted as neither the issuer nor the guarantor - collapsed UK
property company Mountleigh Group - had made an interest payment due on the
bonds on May 19.
Last month, UBS had announced that Mountleigh had a 10-day grace period to
meet the payment, and this too had now elapsed. Mountleigh collapsed when
banks owed some Pounds 400m withdrew support and put in KPMG Peat Marwick as
receivers.
Last week, Geneva-based Warburg Soditic also declared three Mountleigh Swiss
franc bonds, for which it acted as lead-manager, as due and payable.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: CSR in the red after ADollars
558m write-down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CSR, the Australian sugar and building products group, yesterday reported a
net loss of ADollars 385m (USDollars 291.6m) for the year to the end of
March, after taking account of a ADollars 558m write-down of asset values.
Net profit before taking abnormal items into account fell by 46 per cent to
ADollars 175m.
The loss was in line with expectations following earlier profit warnings and
the publication in April of a ruling by the Australian Securities Commission
(ASC) on the accounting treatment of the write-down.
CSR announced earlier this year it had written down the value of plant,
equipment, goodwill and trademarks by ADollars 558m in order to comply with
accounting standards requiring assets to be accounted at recoverable values.
The directors reduced the final dividend to 10 cents, fully franked, from 16
cents last year. The total dividend will be 20 cents, fully franked,
compared with 32 cents last year.
Mr Ian Burgess, managing director, said conditions in CSR's main markets had
deteriorated for the second successive year.
Sugar prices fell 20 per cent, and construction activity fell 10 per cent in
Australia and 12 per cent in the group's US markets.
Mr Burgess said economic recovery in the US and Australia was patchy. There
was little evidence that real strength would return before 1993.
However, the group's prospects remained strong because of its low gearing
and conservatively valued assets. The group had intended to treat the
asset-value write-down as an extraordinary loss. This would have avoided the
need to reduce 1991-92 net profits, which it had earlier forecast would fall
to less than ADollars 200m.
However, the ASC said the write-down should be treated as an abnormal loss,
which required CSR to deduct the amount from trading profits.
CSR was given court approval recently to transfer ADollars 558m from its
share premium reserve to the profit and loss account to offset the impact of
the write-down on retained profits.
Bruce Jacques in Sydney writes: The Australian grocery group Davids Holdings
has launched a Dollars A120m takeover offer for Queensland-based QIW
Retailers.
If successful, the bid would increase Davids' domination of the eastern
states grocery business, lifting its national market share from around 15 to
almost 18 per cent.
Davids has annual revenues of about ADollars 3.3m.
QIW is the largest grocery wholesaler in Queensland, with a 15 per cent
share of that market.
Davids is offering ADollars 6.75 cash a share, and intends to sell its
holding down to 55 per cent and keep QIW listed, but the two companies'
operations would be merged.
Davids directors said the Trade Practices Commission had advised it would
not oppose the QIW bid.
The offer represents a change of tack for Davids, which was until yesterday
concentrating its expansion in Western Australia and South Australia.

existing products.
These products will be used in boats manufactured by Outboard Marine
companies and will be marketed by Volvo Penta to independent boat
manufacturers worldwide under its brand name.
The new company will acquire the existing Outboard Marine production
facility in Lexington, Tennessee.
The companies said the agreement, subject to the approval of the boards of
both parties and various governmental authorities, was expected to be

UPJOHN, the US pharm-aceuticals group, is implementing a temporary freeze on

A company spokesman said the policy review, designed to improve the
company's operating performance and margins, might be completed by the end

but an Upjohn spokesman said yesterday that its 'strategic vision' included
the belief that it was 'in the best interests of all stakeholders to remain
an independent pharmaceuticals company.'
Analysts noted that patents on three of Upjohn's leading drugs - including
Halcion, the sleeping pill recently banned in the UK - were due to expire in
the next two years, suggesting Upjohn would need to clamp down on costs.

<TEXT>
LOWER gold output and lower prices, combined with higher taxes, weakened
first-quarter results of Canada's International Corona which is planning a
merger with Homestake Mining, the US gold producer.
Corona's earnings were CDollars 1.4m (USDollars 1.1m), or 2 cents a share,
down from CDollars 6m, or 6 cents a year earlier, on revenues of CDollars
64m, against CDollars 75m. Production was 169,000 oz, a fall of 10,000 oz
because of the closure of two small Canadian operations. Average cash cost
was USDollars 210 per oz, against USDollars 202, while the average price
received was USDollars 370, compared with USDollars 385.
SEC approval for the merger has been delayed, reportedly because of
accounting and valuation differences between Canada and the US.
The two companies would have annual gold production of about 1.4m oz and
annual revenues of more than USDollars 500m. Homestake's experience in
autoclave production would be applied to Corona's Canadian operations.
Homestake would gain control of the Eskay Creek gold property in
north-western British Columbia and Corona's interests in the Williams and
David Bell gold mines in northern Ontario.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Rivals buy Steinberg food chain
for CDollars 275m

THE 75-year-old Steinberg food chain, a former North American leader in
automated warehousing and manufacture, is about to disappear from eastern
Canada.
Steinberg, opened in Montreal by Ida Steinberg, a Polish immigrant, in 1917,
is being taken over by its rivals Provigo and Metro-Richelieu, for CDollars
275m (USDollars 231m). This amount is barely enough to repay bank debt and
suppliers.
Steinberg was once the leader in Quebec. It expanded into Ontario and the
Maritimes and diversified into general merchandising.
Then Ida's eldest son, Sam, main architect of the company's phenomenal
post-war growth, died. Soon afterwards, less purposeful management allowed
competitors to gain ground and the 1982-1983 recession dealt Steinberg a
severe blow.
The Steinberg family sold control for about CDollars 1bn in 1989, the real
estate going to the Caisse de Depot, the Quebec Pension Plan's investment
arm, for about CDollars 800m.
The supermarkets and warehouses went to the Montreal entrepreneur Mr Michel
Gaucher.
However, the latest recession, price wars, and Quebec's heavy unemployment
has finally caught up with Mr Gaucher.
He has sold most of the remaining 115 supermarkets to the two competitors,
with the Caisse's blessing. The Steinberg name will soon be gone.
Loblaw of Toronto, Canada's biggest food distributor, made an unsuccessful
bid for Steinberg in 1989 and tried again this year.
Many Steinberg employees, fearing further rationalisation, preferred Loblaw,
but its bid was refused.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Fujitsu to swallow rest of Poqet
</HEADLINE>

   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
POQET Computer, a pioneer in the market for pocket-sized personal computers,
is to become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Fujitsu and the vehicle for the
Japanese computer giant's entry into the US and European personal computer
markets.
Fujitsu, which already holds more than 80 per cent of Poqet's equity as a
result of a series of investments, is in the process of acquiring the
remaining portion which is owned by current and former Poqet executives.
The company was yesterday renamed Fujitsu Personal Systems.
Fujitsu's investments in Poqet stem from a long-standing business
relationship with Mr Robb Wilmot, chairman of Poqet and the former chairman
of ICL, the UK computer company now owned by Fujitsu.
ICL is also expected to play a role in Fujitsu's expansion of European
personal computer sales.
The Poqet acquisition represents a strategic move by Fujitsu, said Mr
Tadayasu Sugita, former general manager of Fujitsu's personal computer
division in Japan, who became president of Poqet last year.
The trend in reducing the size of computer technology, in which networks of
personal computers are increasingly replacing larger minicomputers and
mainframes, means it is increasingly important for Fujitsu to have a
world-wide presence in the personal computer market, Mr Sugita explained.
Although Fujitsu's Personal Systems Division in Japan recorded sales last
year of Dollars 2bn (that includes word processors and some consumer
products), the company has yet to make any significant inroads into the
international market.
The company will use Poqet's established US and European distribution and
marketing operations as the basis for its market expansion. 'That is the
reason for Fujitsu's decision,' he said.
Initially, Fujitsu will focus on the portable personal computer market with
the tiny 'Poqet', a miniature personal computer, and Poqet's recently
announced pen-computer will attempt to penetrate the emerging market for
carry-along computers.
Ultimately, however, Fujitsu will address broader segments of the portable
personal computer market, 'after we have achieved a foothold and good brand
name recognition'.
International Business Machines is to acquire a minority stake in Parallan
Computer, a California computer company that specialises in network servers.
The IBM investment is part of an agreement between the companies to work
together on development of servers and networking software.
IBM will obtain worldwide rights to market products developed by Parallan
and future products developed by the alliance.
Mr Paul C. Mugge, vice-president of development, IBM Entry Systems
Technology, said: 'We expect the IBM/Parallan alliance to provide industry
leadership in network servers this year and in years to come.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Digital to lose 3,700 employees
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIGITAL Equipment said that 3,700 employees in the US, including seven of
the company's vice-presidents, would leave the company under an early
retirement programme that began in March.
Digital has been trying to cut its payroll for two years in the face of
losses and declining sales. It had about 119,500 employees when the
retirement scheme was announced in early March, against a peak of 126,000 at
the end of 1989.
The response to the early retirement programme has been stronger than
expected. Digital offered retirement incentives to 7,200 US employees over
the age of 50, expecting about one-third to accept. Further job cuts are
expected.
For the first three quarters of fiscal 1992, Digital reported net losses of
Dollars 403.9m, including charges, on sales of Dollars 10bn. It expects an
additional charge, perhaps as high as Dollars 1bn, in the current fourth
quarter.
Digital said seven corporate officers would take early retirement. They
include Mr George Chamberlain, vice-president, marketing finance; Mr Henry
Crouse, vice-president, strategic relations, and former president of the
Open Software Foundation; Mr James Cudmore, vice-president, operations
staff; Mr William Heffner, vice-president, image, voice and video products;
Mr Robert Hughes, vice-president, US sales; Mr Albert Mullin, Jr.,
vice-president, corporate relations; and Mr Richard Yen, vice-president, Far
East manufacturing.

hotel merger

<TEXT>
AIR FRANCE and Lufthansa of Germany have pulled back from plans to merge
their hotel operations. The airlines emphasised the merger when they
announced plans for closer co-operation in the hotels business at the end of
April.
Lufthansa said yesterday some form of merger between Lufthansa's Kempinski
hotels and Air France's Meridien hotel chain was still an objective.
However, co-operation at this stage would be limited to a marketing
agreement whereby the parent airlines market each others' hotel
subsidiaries.
Lufthansa said if this worked out it planned to take the second step of
combining the shares into a mutual holding company. However, it said there
was no timetable for such a merger. If it happened, the two hotel companies
would maintain separate legal status.
It was implied in the Lufthansa statement that the German hotel group had
worried about preserving its standards in the event of a merger.
'Irrespective of the future structure of the ownership of the joint
holding,' it said, 'no major decisions will be made without the consent of
Lufthansa, thus guaranteeing the interests of Kempinski.
'Therefore the name of Kempinski, as well as its standards and quality, will
be maintained,' it said.
Both airlines yesterday denied the two-stage agreement differed from the
draft contract agreed on April.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: DG Bank to restructure overseas
operations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEUTSCHE Genossen-schaftsbank, the central bank for Germany's co-operative
banks, is restructuring its overseas operations.
After rationalising its domestic activities, the financially-stretched bank
has decided to close DG Finance in Paris, DG Investment Bank in London and
New York, and a securities interest in Singapore.
Buyers will be sought for two other operations, one in London and another in
Amsterdam. In future, securities business will be managed from the bank's
Frankfurt headquarters.
Together with other rationalisation in commercial banking, these closures
are likely to lead to the loss of around 180 jobs out of the 780 currently
filled in 14 overseas centres. This will contribute to the total 800 job
cuts the bank wants to make within the next five years.
To build up its commercial banking operations overseas, the bank intends to
open representative offices in Madrid, Milan and Paris. It also plans to
intensify its business in eastern Europe and Turkey with its existing joint
venture partners in the region; representative offices are likely to be
opened in Warsaw, Prague and Budapest.
The person behind moves to tighten the overseas network is Mr Bernd
Thiemann, chief executive since early 1991, who outlined his plans in
October.
Under his predecessor, the bank became involved in a complicated dispute
over bond and sale agreements with French banks, leading to heavy
write-downs. In October DG Bank announced a DM1.4bn cash injection.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International Company News: Swiss business opens its doors
to the world / A look at rapidly changing attitudes among the country's
company directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCARCELY an eyebrow was raised in Swiss business circles when Ascom, the
telecommunications equipment group, revealed last week that a majority of
its capital was held by non-Swiss.
And the group's announcement that it proposed appointing a German and an
American to its board of directors drew only muted reaction.
A few years ago, such developments would have provoked shock and dismay in
Switzerland's introverted business community. With a mercantile culture
uncannily similar to Japan's, Swiss industry thrived for a long time by
attacking markets all over the world while keeping most operations at home.
Ownership and top management posts remained exclusively in Swiss hands.
In the past few years, however, top Swiss industrialists have recognised
that being international now requires more than having sales offices abroad.
And this year the pace of change has accelerated sharply.
Among the big companies and banks, cases of exclusively Swiss boards of
directors are now the exception rather than the rule. And many companies are
actively encouraging foreign ownership of their shares.
Swiss business leaders seem to be making these changes with their eyes open.
'Our responsibility is to run an international group called Sandoz, not to
stick to our roots,' says Mr Rolf W. Schweizer, group vice-president
responsible for strategic planning at the big Basle-based pharmaceutical
group.
Mr Schweizer says it was even possible that Sandoz would one day move its
headquarters out of Switzerland, especially if some Swiss hostility to some
types of pharmaceutical research continued.
For now, what is noticeable is that Sandoz and other leading companies are
aggressively building up operations abroad while just ticking over or
cutting back in Switzerland.
Nestle, which has hitherto concentrated its group management in Vevey,
revealed recently that, in the wake of its takeover of Source Perrier, it
would locate the headquarters of its mineral water operations in France.
Sandoz is expanding drug production in Ireland and the US. The big Swiss
banks have shifted large chunks of their capital market operations out of
Switzerland to London and Luxembourg.
The changed focus often shows up through big foreign acquisitions. The
engineering group, Brown Boveri, led the way in 1987 with its huge merger
with Asea of Sweden. Roche basically moved its biotechnology research effort
from Basle to the US when it bought a controlling stake in Genentech two
years ago. Schindler, the world's second largest lifts group, bought
Westinghouse's lift business in 1989 and is now concentrating on building up
its position in the east Asia.
The big Swiss insurance companies, Zurich and Winterthur, have also been
active on the foreign acquisition trail.
Ascom made a strategic leap in the world corporate telecoms equipment sector
by acquiring Timeplex in the US last year. The group, which a few years ago
was largely dependent on the Swiss state posts and telecoms authority for
its revenue, is aiming to make 70 per cent of its sales abroad by the end of
the century.
The reasons for these moves tend to be the same.
Probably the most important is that the Swiss-skilled manpower pool is no
longer sufficient for the needs of the international companies. This is
particularly the case in high technology fields and the fast-moving
financial specialities, such as the design and trading of derivatives. Yet
companies and banks find it increasingly difficult at a time of rising
unemployment to get permits for foreigners to live and work in Switzerland.
In the past, Switzerland's neutrality and its laws providing solid
protection of intellectual property were strong incentives to keep research,
development and production inside the country, but these characteristics are
no longer as unusual or important. The cozy Swiss capital markets, which
used to be adequate for most companies' needs, are in decline and can no
longer provide the large amounts of capital on the internationally
competitive terms that big companies demand. Thus, they have had no choice
but to open their share registers to foreigners and meet the tough
disclosure requirements that international capital markets demand.
As they do so, they risk running afoul of Switzerland's Lex Friedrich, the
law which obliges companies wanting to buy property to prove that more than
half their capital is owned by Swiss nationals. Otherwise, any proposed
purchase is subjected to a government review. Last week, Ascom revealed it
had gone through that process on a purchase last year.
(Banks will probably maintain limits on foreign shareholdings, as Swiss
ownership is crucial to their Swiss status for regulatory purposes.)
The inevitable effect of these trends will be to dilute the 'Swissness' of
the companies. Whether that is a good thing or not remains to be seen. In
the past, the close-knit Swiss business community has usually closed ranks
to save a member in distress, as in the case of the rescue organised last
year by the big banks for the armaments and engineering group,
Oerlikon-Buhrle.
As companies become more cosmopolitan, this sort of community spirit is
likely to weaken.
The Swiss media already feels betrayed. It roundly criticised Ciba-Geigy,
the pharmaceutical group, and CS Holding, the parent company of Credit
Suisse, for holding their annual press conferences last month in London
rather than in Switzerland.
And the new chairman of Societe Generale de Surveillance, the Geneva-based
inspection group, has been attacked for replacing some of the group's Swiss
directors with foreigners.
In spite of this grumbling, the centrifugal trends are unlikely to be
reversed. They might slow a bit if Switzerland joins the European Economic
Area (EEA), the new free trade association between the European Community
and the seven countries of the European Free Trade Area (EFTA). EEA
membership would require the country to permit free entry of people and
capital from other EEA countries, and to exempt EEA nationals from the Lex
Friedrich.
However, this liberalisation would not come into effect until 1998, and most
companies seem to feel they cannot wait that long.

CARLSBERG, the brewery group, reported a 7 per cent increase in pre-tax
profits, from DKr623m to DKr670m (Dollars 108.4m), in the half-year to March
31. However, the interim statement said all but DKr10m of the increase was
due to changes in accounting principles.
Operating profits were, however, ahead by 27 per cent from DKr385m to
DKr491. Factors in the improvement were continued rationalisation of Danish
brewing operations and the disposal last summer of the loss-making Spanish
brewery, Union Cervecera.
Net interest income fell from DKr231m to DKr189m, taking profits before
extraordinary items from DKr616m last year to DKr680m.
Sales declined by DKr29m to DKr4.70bn. In the absence of unforeseen events,
pre-tax profits for the year are expected to be on a level with last year's
DKr1.23bn, said the statement.
Accounting principles were changed to include shares of profits in
associated companies. Earlier, only dividends from associated companies were
included.
The interim statement said it was taking longer than expected to obtain
approval for the merger of the UK brewing interests of Allied-Lyons and
Carlsberg, which was proposed last October. Although the delay was
postponing the advantages from the merger, the two groups expected to secure
the necessary approvals, it said.
The UK Mergers and Monopolies Commission is due to hand its recommendations
to the Department of Trade and Industry on June 12, said Mr Michael Iuul, a
member of the group board of management.
If the MMC does not not give unconditional clearance for the merger, he
expected there to be negotiations with the DTI to make the necessary
adjustments to the agreement between Carlsberg and Allied-Lyons.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
VIAG, the acquisitive German conglomerate, yesterday forecast a further rise
in profits this year and its ninth consecutive dividend increase.
The company will continue its vigorous expansion, with plans to spend about
DM2bn a year on investment in growth, according to an interim report
published yesterday.
Viag's latest acquisitions in packaging and motor components contributed to
a 26 per cent rise in group sales to DM6.15bn (Dollars 3.8bn) in the first
quarter and a 'modest' but unspecified rise in operating profits.
Confirming net earnings for 1991 of DM405m, the company proposed a DM9
dividend, compared with the previous year's DM336m profits and pay-out of
DM8.50. Improved results this year would allow this dividend policy to
continue, it added.
Viag, which draws about 50 per cent of its earnings from stakes in German
electricity and gas companies, and 40 per cent from aluminium and packaging,
said it was negotiating to buy a majority stake in Debrunner-Koenig,
Switzerland's biggest steel trader. Last month it concluded a deal to take a
majority in another steel concern, Metalpo of Italy.
Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, chairman, told shareholders yesterday that the group's
expansion strategy, based on taking 51 per cent holdings in compatible
groups, had so far proved very successful.
It spent DM115m on such moves in the first quarter of this year, compared
with DM3m in the first quarter of 1991. Acquisitions last year accounted for
about half the investment budget of DM4bn.
Future core business areas highlighted yesterday include packaging,
chemicals, motor components and health foods.
Last year's acquisition of Continental Can Europe has made Viag, which
already owned Gerresheimer Glas, one of Germany's leading packaging groups.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BEP falls to Pounds 4m and board changes
planned
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOARD CHANGES are likely soon at the Bristol Evening Post, the regional
newspaper in which Sunday Sport publisher Mr David Sullivan owns a 10 per
cent stake.
Along with the announcement of a 15 per cent fall in annual pre-tax profits
to Pounds 4.06m, Mr Michael Gay, chief executive of BEP, said top managerial
changes would be announced later this month 'which would lead to possible
board appointments'.
Mr Gay said the changes had come as the result of an 'internal reappraisal'.
The candidates - who could come from outside the company - are unlikely to
include Mr Sullivan, who was thwarted in his attempt to win a seat on the
board at an extraordinary meeting in August.
Mr Sullivan, a multi-millionaire who made his fortune through the sale of a
string of sex shops in 1981, was also blocked by the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission from taking a controlling stake in the middle-market tabloid in
1990.
The advertising recession continued to weigh heavily on BEP over the year
ending March 31. Mr Gay said a sharp decline in advertising - 67 per cent of
total newspaper revenues - had been the main reason for the profits decline.
Sales were flat at Pounds 61.4m.
Employment advertising was hardest hit, with revenues down by 36 per cent to
Pounds 3.5m. Mr Gay said there was no sign of an upturn in advertising, and
any recovery would be 'very long term'.
Newspaper profits fell from Pounds 1.4m to Pounds 800,000. Sales of the
flagship paper rose by 2.5 per cent to 102,000 average daily circulation.
The increase had been achieved by becoming more 'popular', Mr Gay said, and
not by moving down-market.
BEP retained 83 retail outlets, although it was still planned to reduce this
to 50 confectionery and newsagent shops. The retail division had been
disappointing, with profits down almost 32 per cent to Pounds 463,000.
During the year, BEP reduced staff from 937 to 810, while 72 employees took
pay cuts of up to Pounds 3,500. Net savings of Pounds 1m were achieved as a
result. Mr Gay said cost-cutting would save a further Pounds 2.1m in the
current year.
The redundancies resulted in an exceptional cost of Pounds 3.2m which was
offset by the sale of 357,800 Reuters shares for Pounds 3.3m. BEP retains
525,000 shares, representing Pounds 6.2m at yesterday's close. The company
has Pounds 2.7m cash in the bank.
Earnings per share fell from 13.54p to 12.44p.
A maintained final dividend of 7.75p makes an unchanged 11.5p total.

Losses per share were 9.6p (18.3p), reflecting a consolidation and rights

The company has now negotiated the refinancing demanded by its banks.
Private and institutional shareholders will subscribe to Pounds 978,000 loan
stock, the European Coal and Steel Community will provide a Pounds 250,000

The group also has a cost-cutting programme including redundancies, and is
considering mergers or disposals. No improvement in sales is expected until
1993.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Record Pounds 2m at Hicking Pentecost
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RECOVERY AT Hicking Pentecost was confirmed yesterday as the Cardiff-based
textiles and specialist castings manufacturer reported profits ahead to a
record Pounds 2.17m pre-tax for the year to the end of March.
The outcome - scored on turnover ahead to Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 21.1m) -
compared to Pounds 782,000 last time and a deficit of Pounds 1.69m the year
before.
Mr John Lister, chairman, said that Nicholson Plastics, which makes glass
reinforced plastic water storage tanks, made a better-than-expected
contribution to profits since its acquisition last July.
Since the year-end, Hicking has acquired Thompson Horseley Bridge, another
water tank manufacturer, and Mr Lister said that further purchases were
being sought.
Operating margins and return on capital improved, he said, and the proceeds
of last year's open offer, after the Nicholson purchase, helped to cut
borrowings.
Gearing was eliminated by the year-end with a net cash balance of about
Pounds 1.5m.
After an increased tax charge, earnings per share improved 44 per cent to
11.25p (7.82p). A proposed final dividend of 2.2p lifts the total by 51 per
cent to 3.4p.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: US financier claims to have taken stake in
Dollars 1bn WPP debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR GARY KLESCH, a London-based American financier, has announced that his
company, Klesch and Company, has 'within the last 10 days' bought an
unspecified amount of the bank debt of WPP, the troubled international
marketing services group which owes Dollars 1bn (Pounds 500m).
However, WPP expressed surprise at the suggestion that Mr Klesch had bought
some of its debt - Dollars 1bn spread across a 28 bank syndicate - since the
company had not been informed that debt had been consigned to another
holder. This is normally a technical requirement for such debt sales.
Mr Klesch said he had not yet bought the debt 'under assignment' which he
said 'would require WPP's consent not to be unreasonably withheld' but on a
'sub-participation basis'. He suggested that a contract between himself and
a selling bank does not require prior WPP approval.
He declined to say which of WPP's banks have sold him WPP debt, what amount
of debt had been sold or at what price.
WPP said Mr Klesch might have a 'phantom' arrangement with some of the banks
to eventually purchase WPP debt, but that actual purchase of the debt could
not go ahead without WPP's approval. WPP added that 'it would be most
unlikely' for the group to agree that any of its debt eventually be
reassigned to Mr Klesch.
Mr Klesch said that he intended to seek to have the debt fully assigned to
him eventually, but probably not in the next two weeks. He added that it was
normal practice for his company - which deals in corporate restructures and
value-impaired assets - initially to buy secondary bank debt on the 'silent'
sub-participation basis before going fully public.
There have been signs for some time that some of the smaller banks in the
syndicate are unhappy with their WPP loans and wish to withdraw from the
syndicate. Mr Klesch yesterday declined to say whether his purchase of WPP
bank debt was intended to enable him to take a stake in the group or for
trading on at a future date.
WPP is currently in the midst of discussions with its banking syndicate on a
refinancing proposal which would see the banks subscribe for a rights issue
of Pounds 150m, which would be used to reduce the group's debt by 25 per
cent. In exchange, the banks would agree to subscribe for up to 55 per cent
of the enlarged equity. In turn, such a proposal would require shareholder
approval; there have been indications in the last two weeks that some
shareholders are dissatisfied with the terms on offer.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Cullen's dips to Pounds 608,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CULLEN'S HOLDINGS, the food retailer, experienced a fall in annual profits
despite a strong performance from its neighbourhood food stores and an
increase in turnover from Pounds 18.1m to Pounds 20.6m.
The pre-tax figure for the year to March 1 fell from Pounds 825,000 to
Pounds 608,000, reflecting primarily the decline in profits from the sale of
franchises on existing stores.
Retail operations contributed Pounds 509,000 to operating profits, an
increase of almost 40 per cent over the previous year, reflecting the
strength of the neighbourhood food store operation.
The company has launched two new food retail formats, a prototype patisserie
cafe and chicken and ribs restaurant which also supplies speciality foods to
the stores.
Development and launch costs of these prototypes have been written off
within the Pounds 146,000 exceptional items, which also include compensation
paid to a former director.
There is currently no debt and an unchanged dividend of 0.5p is recommended,
payable from earnings of 1.5p (2.8p).

<TEXT>
MTM, the chemicals group, has secured extended credit facilities with its
banks until January 4 next year.
The move, involving a standstill arrangement, follows two short extensions
after the disclosure last month that it was in breach of its covenants.
MTM ended the 1991 year with total endebtedness of Pounds 82.2m. By last
month, when the group announced its results for 1991, debt had risen to
Pounds 106.7m. Mr Ken Schofield, the newly appointed chief executive, has
said his main objective would be to reduce the company's debt to about
Pounds 50m.
Meanwhile, the company has received the final version of a report by
auditors Binder Hamlyn on the events leading up to the series of profit
warnings this spring. The report is understood to reveal transactions that
were 'incorrectly recorded' last year and in 1990.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Disposals help Faber Prest advance to
Pounds 1.84m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHEDDING less-profitable businesses helped Faber Prest, the industrial and
distribution services group, lift pre-tax profits in the first half by 2 per
cent to Pounds 1.84m.
Mr Roger Feaviour, the former Norcros executive who took over at Faber in
September, said the company had taken out 'elements which contributed large
turnover' but not much profit.
The result was a 12.5 per cent decline in sales to Pounds 34.7m for the six
months to March 31, and steady operating profits of Pounds 2.2m.
At the same time, Faber reduced debt from Pounds 9.5m at the year-end to
Pounds 6m at the interim stage. About half of the decline was achieved
through disposals and the rest by cash management.
Gearing stood at 32 per cent and interest was 4.5 times covered with
payments 48 per cent down at Pounds 530,000.
The dividend is maintained at 4.3p, payable out of earnings marginally ahead
at 11.69p (11.65p).
The most surprising performance in the first half came from the industrial
services division which concentrates on recycling slag for use in road
surfaces.
In spite of the depressed steel industry, this division managed to increase
margins from 9.9 to 10.8 per cent. As a result, profits were maintained at
Pounds 1.3m, on sales 8 per cent down.
The rise in margins had been achieved through increased efficiency, said Mr
Feaviour, while at the same time offering lower-than-inflationary price
increases to hard-pressed.
The bad news came from Faber's share in slag recycler Appleby Group - which
swung from a Pounds 208,000 profits contribution to a Pounds 126,000 loss.
This depressed profits from associated undertakings by 54 per cent to Pounds
194,000.
Distribution increased its profits contribution by 14 per cent to Pounds
900,000.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Westland advances 11% and seeks closer
links with Agusta
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTLAND, the helicopter group, is intensifying its industrial links with
Agusta, the Italian state-controlled helicopter company, in an effort to
forge a second European helicopter partnership to compete against the
recently established Franco-German Eurocopter venture.
The group said it was getting closer to Agusta and looking for new
co-operation opportunities with the Italian company. The two companies are
joint partners in the development of the EH101 anti-submarine and search and
rescue helicopters.
Westland also reported yesterday a 11 per cent increase in pre-tax profits
to Pounds 10.4m for the six months to March 27, compared with Pounds 9.4m.
The figure was helped by a lower exceptional charge of Pounds 900,000
(Pounds 3.4m) mainly because of lower redundancy costs.
Mr Alan Jones, Westland's chief executive, said the EH101 programme
underpinned the future of the company's helicopter business. He described
the collaboration with Agusta as encouraging and expected it to lead to
greater co-operation in production and marketing activities.
However, he emphasised the two companies were not considering equity
investments or other financial links at this stage.
Mr Jones said the UK government's agreement last year to acquire 44 EH101
helicopters for the Royal Navy would provide Westland with business worth
Pounds 900m, the first helicopters being due to be delivered in 1995.
Italy is also committed to buy EH101 helicopters for its navy but the order
hinges on Italian parliamentary approval. Although the current confused
political situation in Italy has made the timing of the helicopter order
uncertain, Italy is expected to order 16 with options on an additional
eight.
Westland would benefit by about Pounds 125m from the Italian order.
Mr Jones said Canada was reviewing the possibility of acquiring 50 of the
helicopters. He expected a decision by the end of this year but conceded
Canada could either go ahead or drop the proposal.
While seeking closer ties with Agusta in Europe, Westland is continuing to
co-operate with Sikorsky and McDonnell Douglas of the US on other military
programmes.
Westland has teamed up with McDonnell Douglas to bid for a Pounds 2bn UK
army attack helicopter contract based on the McDonnell Douglas Apache AH-64.
It faces competition from the Franco-German Eurocopter Tiger helicopter,
which may bid with British Aerospace, and a joint bid from General Electric
Company of the UK and Bell of the US with the Cobra Venom helicopter.
The army is expected to make a formal request for bids next year.
Westland is also hoping to clinch an order to manufacture up to 88 Sikorsky
Black Hawk helicopters for Saudi Arabia. Mr Jones said the timing of the
order remained uncertain and Westland was not expecting any significant
developments in the immediate future.
The Black Hawk requirement would be part of the second phase of the Saudi Al
Yamamah defence contract led by British Aerospace. Mr Jones said the Saudis'
top priority was a new air base, followed by additional Tornado aircraft
with the Black Hawks in third place.
Mr Jones was satisfied with the company's first half performance which
showed improvements in the profit margins of all the company's divisions in
difficult market conditions.
Turnover fell from Pounds 241.4m to Pounds 198.1m because of fewer
helicopter deliveries.
Earnings per share fell to 4.8p, compared with 6.1p after an increased tax
charge of Pounds 2.5m (Pounds 1.1m) reflecting a higher tax rate of 24 per
cent (20 per cent). The interim dividend is maintained at 1.25p.
Mr Jones said the company's commercial aerospace business had been affected
by the difficulties of the civil aircraft and airline markets. But the
company is hoping to see some recovery in the second part of the year as
airline traffic continues to improve.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Net assets fall by 24% at TR Property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TR PROPERTY Investment Trust, which took over New England Properties at the
end of January, yesterday announced a 24 per cent fall in its net asset
value, from 40.61p to 30.71p per share, during the year to March 31.
Revenue before tax fell from Pounds 3.79m to Pounds 1.31m as a result of
lower trading profits and provisions of Pounds 2.15m against the fall in
value of property dealing stock. Group income from fixed investments rose
marginally to Pounds 6.5m.
Mr Paul Hyde-Thomson, chairman, said that the New England Properties
acquisition had fitted well with the existing spread of assets. The
acquisition had enabled TRPIT to increase its weight in industrial property
and increase the income return on the property portfolio to 10.3 per cent.
'Although activity in many areas of the property market is quickening,
values remain depressed and it may be some time before our markets reflect
the economic recovery that appears to be beginning,' he said.
Earnings per share fell from 1.04p to 0.34p. A final dividend of 0.85p is
proposed, making an unchanged 1.45p for the year.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Borthwicks' flavours decision justified
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Thomson, chairman of Borthwicks, said the improved results for the
year to March 28 justified the decision to dispose of the meat business and
concentrate on natural flavours and food products.
Pre-tax profits improved from Pounds 255,000 to Pounds 1.29m, helped by
exceptional profits of Pounds 226,000 relating to profits on the sale of a
trademark less reorganisation costs. Last time there were exceptional
charges of Pounds 633,000.
At the operating level profits were Pounds 1.76m, compared with Pounds 1.16m
which included losses of Pounds 543,000 on discontinued businesses. Turnover
fell from Pounds 51.3m to Pounds 44.4m but stripping out the Pounds 13.9m
from discontinued businesses there was a 19 per cent rise.
Mr Thomson said that 'operating margins had widened, from 2.25 per cent to
3.98 per cent, reflecting a striking improvement in the underlying quality
of the ongoing businesses'. Especially pleasing had been progress at Globe
Extracts in the US where although profits were similar there had been a move
to higher quality.
He added that the group was increasing its emphasis on the natural flavours
business as shown by the acquisition of Cooke Tweedale &amp; Lindsay.
In giving greater importance to the final dividend the proposed distribution
is raised to 0.6p (0.5p) for a total of 1.1p (1p). Earnings per share came
out at 1.8p (0.1p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Hawthorn Leslie, the subject of a restructuring which entailed disposals and
rationalisation to reduce debt, incurred a pre-tax loss of Pounds 13.5m for
1991.
The deficit, which compared with losses of Pounds 13.7m last time, included
operating losses of Pounds 6.5m from businesses sold or closed.
Earlier this year the USM-quoted group, which is now focusing on mobile
communications, agreed terms with its bankers for restructuring its
remaining debt.
Directors said the actions taken had placed the group in a 'stable financial
position, albeit with a continuing weak balance sheet' and had enabled them
to request the restoration of dealings in the shares - up  1/2 p yesterday
to 2p.
Turnover of continuing businesses amounted to Pounds 49.6m and losses per
share emerged at 6.84p.

Hongkong and Shanghai Bank yesterday purchased 5m shares in Midland Bank at
415p, raising its stake by 0.66 percentage point to 15.23 per cent.
Hongkong Bank declined to identify the seller but said that the shares had
been offered to it by an associated company. The bank said it was not the
prelude to substantial buying of Midland shares.
The Department of Trade and Industry has allowed Midland and Lloyds to trade
in eachother's shares during ordinary business. Such activity would
otherwise be illegal because of the Monopolies and Mergers Commission's
investigation into Lloyds' possible bid for Midland.

Kleinwort Benson Investment Management is to launch an investment trust
aimed at raising about Pounds 30m.
A formal launch is expected within the next two weeks once various technical
details have been decided.
The trust would be the first to invest solely in secondhand unmatured
endowment policies. It will have a fixed life and will probably not pay any
dividends.
A large supply of endowments is available at present, as most are sold as a
repayment mechanism for a mortgage. Many homeowners in arrears on their loan
have opted to sell their endowments to marketmakers.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Dowty shares dip below cash offer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TI GROUP, the specialist engineer, yesterday appeared to lose some of the
momentum it has build up in its hostile Pounds 495m bid for Dowty Group, the
aerospace company, after its target's share price fell in the market.
Dowty's shares fell 5p to 173p, below the 175p value of a cash alternative
that TI has offered shareholders.
Coming just seven days before TI's final offer closes, it was the first time
that Dowty's share price had fallen below the cash alternative.
Arguably it is the first time that Dowty has looked as if it stands a
serious chance of escaping from the confident TI's clutches.
'There are plenty of things that can happen in the next week', said a Dowty
adviser. 'But the word I get from the market is that people are nothing like
as certain that TI is going to win.'
TI said that trading in the shares was thin and dismissed the price fall as
the result of one small sale followed by brokers marking down the shares.
One option, as yet unused, is for TI to buy shares in the market. It is
allowed to buy up to 29 per cent of Dowty at prices up to the 175p cash
alternative or up to 10 per cent of Dowty's shares up to the value of the
four-for-15 share offer.
The share offer was worth 182.4p after TI closed yester-day at 342p after a
share split.
As the two sides traded interpretations of Dowty's share price move, the war
of words continued over Dowty's estimated Pounds 29m pre-tax profit figure
for 1992.
Responding to Dowty's confirmation that it will add a further Pounds 3m to
this figure - from a cancelled Ministry of Defence contract - when it
publishes preliminary figures on Friday, TI again attacked the quality of
its target's earnings.
'Dowty has attempted to bolster its profits with one-off receipts and
credits and has yet to provide a convincing explanation for a higher than
expected profits estimate,' TI said.
Before Dowty announced its Pounds 29m estimate, but after TI had declared
its offer final, the market had been expecting profits of about Pounds 22m.
Mr Roy Roberts, Dowty chairman, wrote to shareholders saying TI's bid was
'running out of wind'.
'Your board sees little or no premium in the level of the TI offers,' he
said.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Celestion Audio and Kef both sold to SE
Asian Kinergetics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO OF the most famous names in British hi-fi were sold yesterday to a
south-east Asian-controlled company.
Celestion Audio was sold by its parent, Celestion, for Pounds 4.7m including
Pounds 1.6m of debt and Pounds 500,000 of goodwill.
The new owner is Kinergetics Holdings (UK), 50 per cent held by a subsidiary
of Hong Kong-based Gold Peak Industries with the remainder divided between
Kinergetics Research, a US audio maker (with 40 per cent) and PL Banner and
Associates, a UK venture capital company.
Kinergetics Holdings also bought Kef Audio, the loudspeaker manufacturer,
from the receiver yesterday. The price was not disclosed.
Mr Paul Banner, Kinergetics Holdings chairman, said: 'These are old English
brand names which could have been marketed better in certain parts of the
world.' He said there was scope for higher revenues in North America and
south-east Asia.
Celestion and Kef are among the companies that have maintained the UK's high
reputation among specialist hi-fi buyers.
The sale leaves Celestion to concentrate on its other businesses in lingerie
and swimwear.
'In a business the size of ours, we have to focus,' said Mr Charles Ryland,
chief executive. 'There is a tremendous opportunity in our textiles
business, primarily with Marks and Spencer.'
The deal will cut gearing from a year-end figure of 42 per cent to about 20
per cent, said Mr Ryland. Gearing would be cut in half again by the end of
the current year in December.
Earnings per share would rise slightly. Mr Ryland said that the disposal of
the audio division was not related to its poor performance last year when it
recorded an operating profit of Pounds 76,000 on sales of Pounds 13.6m,
compared with Pounds 1.2m on Pounds 15.6m in 1990.
Celestion Textiles achieved an operating profit of Pounds 606,000 in 1991 on
sales of Pounds 19.8m, down from the previous year's Pounds 1m. Between 85
per cent and 90 per cent of sales are to Marks and Spencer.

FT  02 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Pacific Horizon hits out at manager Jupiter
Tyndall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DIRECTORS OF Pacific Horizon, the investment trust, yesterday issued a
strong attack on Jupiter Tyndall, its manager, which last month blocked an
agreed takeover.
Martin Currie Pacific had made an offer but Jupiter Tyndall assembled a 25.1
per cent stake in the trust's warrants. This enabled it to block a
resolution allowing for an improved version of the Martin Currie offer at an
extraordinary meeting of warrant holders. A majority of 75 per cent was
required.
Pacific Horizon's board continues unanimously to recommend the Martin Currie
bid. It said it believed it 'unlikely that Jupiter will now put forward
proposals which are better for shareholders than the current Martin Currie
Pacific offers'.
The board's statement went on to express concern at the effect Jupiter
Tyndall's management functions could have on its independence in the offer.
It added that the warrant holding had an approximate aggregate cost of
Pounds 150,000, and that Jupiter Tyndall's management fees in the nine
months to the end of April this year were Pounds 216,873. It stands to lose
these if the Martin Currie bid is successful, according to Pacific Horizon.
The bid has been extended until today. Martin Currie said yesterday that
up-to-date figures on valid acceptances would not be available until this
afternoon. A decision would be taken on whether to continue the offer once
this information is available.
The terms of the deal are complex. Martin Currie is offering to pay
shareholders 92 per cent of the trust's formula asset value. This excludes
11 per cent of the fund's portfolio invested in illiquid stock, which would
be sold, the proceeds being distributed to shareholders.

pouring resources into the former communist countries in a battle for market
share
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
As the countries of the former Soviet Union and eastern Europe adjust to
life after communism, Coca-Cola, the world's largest soft drinks company, is
pushing ahead aggressively with plans to turn them red again.
Gdynia, on Poland's Baltic coast, has just been given the treatment. Dozens
of Coca-Cola salespeople dressed in the company's scarlet livery swarmed
through the city brandishing scarlet promotional material to mark the
opening on Sunday of the first of several new Coke bottling plants in the
country.
The plants are important in Coca-Cola's efforts to come from behind in the
battle for eastern Europe's markets, where PepsiCo, its smaller US
arch-rival, has long had extensive operations and sells up to three times as
many soft drinks. Only in Yugoslavia does Coke out-sell Pepsi. Nor is Pepsi
standing still. It is stepping up investments to help its more than 60,
mainly state-owned, bottlers modernise and to strengthen distribution, sales
and marketing. Ms Susan Hooper, Pepsi's marketing director for eastern
Europe, says competition is so intense that a regional 'cola war' is
looming.
For both companies, the potential looks almost limitless. Per capita
consumption of soft drinks in the region is far below western European
levels, and western products are a fraction of total sales. 'Clearly, these
will be among our fastest-growing markets anywhere,' says Mr Neville Isdell,
president of Coke's Northeast Europe/Africa division. 'In percentage terms,
growth will be spectacular.'
Coke's first big move was in eastern Germany, where it dispatched an advance
team soon after the Berlin Wall fell and aims to invest more than Dollars
450m (Pounds 250m). More recently, the company has turned further east,
announcing a string of deals and further investments of almost Dollars 1bn
in local bottling, distribution and marketing.
Pepsi refuses to be impressed by such figures. 'I'll believe them when I see
them,' sniffs Ms Hooper. 'Coke sometimes tends to add a couple of zeros to
its sums.'
Nevertheless, Coke's ambitions are exceeding even its resources, prompting
it to search out partners wherever it can find them. Hungary and
Czechoslovakia have been entrusted to Coca-Cola Amatil (CCA), a 51 per
cent-owned Australian affiliate which runs Coke's operations in Austria,
while Coke's bottler in Greece is handling Bulgaria and Romania. Coke has
also signed several deals in the former Soviet Union.
Coke's sales are rising fastest in Hungary, where CCA has two bottling
plants. But the biggest short-term target is Poland, where a five-fold
increase in production and investments of Dollars 150m are planned over
three years. Coca-Cola will split the costs with Ringnes, its Norwegian
bottler, which is helping run some operations.
In the past, most east European governments tied the company's sales
volumes, like Pepsi's, to its willingness to engage in counter-trade, and
allocated production to state-owned bottlers who neither knew nor cared much
about the business. Unlike Pepsi, Coke has chosen to sever many traditional
business links and start again from scratch.
But finding suitable sites for new plants in countries where property rights
are often hazy and there is no real property market has not been easy. Nor
has acquiring existing businesses been exactly trouble-free.
In the Czech republic CCA was allowed to buy a state-owned bottler only
after agreeing to donate funds to the Prague zoo and to a research
institute. What it got was an over-engineered plant with a defective water
purification system which needed to be completely re-equipped.
Though Coke flies in expatriates to support its fledgling east European
businesses, it wants them to become entirely locally managed. All 230
permanent staff at the Gdynia plant are Poles or Polish speakers, and it is
run by a former general manager of a local shipping line.
Coca-Cola starts with a big advantage - one of the best-known international
brands in eastern Europe. So much so that the company - unlike Pepsi, which
is still widely viewed as a local product - sees no need yet for television
advertising.
'Putting cold bottles on shelves is the best marketing we can do,' says Mr
Isdell. 'We don't have to ask ourselves if our product will sell, only how
do we get it to the consumer?'
That involves more than building modern plants. The biggest challenge is to
build up what Coca-Cola calls 'the system' - the highly-developed
distribution, marketing and service network which is its most powerful
weapon in the battle for retail customers.
Trained sales and delivery staff in brightly coloured Coca-Cola trucks are
already roving the streets of east European cities, visiting shops and
cafes, filling display racks and advising owners on how to promote the
company's products.
For retailers long accustomed to surly and unreliable state-owned suppliers,
the experience is a revelation, says Mr Isdell: 'When our people say they'll
be back with more stocks next Friday, shopkeepers are amazed.' More of a
problem is finding reliable customers. Coke says that in it first six months
in Poland, retail customer turnover reached 60 per cent, though conditions
have since begun to stabilise.
Initially, Coke is pricing its products at only two thirds the level in west
Germany. However, as trade barriers with the EC fall, it expects to raise
prices to prevent 'parallel' imports of cheap east European Coke streaming
westwards.
But right now the flow is all the other way, as Coke continues to pour in
resources. Mr Isdell is coy about when the investments will show returns.
'We take a long-term view,' he says. 'None the less, we will have profitable
operations in each country within three years of start-up.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Anglo American rises 15% and sees economic upturn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO American Corporation, South Africa's largest company, yesterday
signalled optimism about the prospects for an economic upturn by lifting its
dividend 6 per cent on the back of maintained earnings for the year to the
end of March.
Mr Julian Ogilvie Thompson, chairman, said he was pleased with the results
given the background of a quiet world economy and weak commodity prices. The
result was testimony to the strength and diversity of the group's interests,
in terms of location, commodities and industry, he said.
Pre-tax income rose 15 per cent to R2.45bn (Pounds 472m), consisting mainly
of R1.65bn investment income, R507m trading income, and R222m surplus from
the realisation of investments.
The increased surplus on realisation of investments, up from R47m in 1991,
is the result of the sale of a number of holdings.
The R630m realised from the sale of large stakes in First National Bank and
Gencor was treated as extraordinary income, with R500m set aside as a
general provision against the carrying value of investments and loans.
Although attributable earnings were 20 per cent higher at R1.68bn, helped by
the investment surpluses, the retained earnings of associate companies
dropped by 22 per cent to R927m, leaving equity accounted earnings
marginally higher at R2.61bn, from R2.59bn.
A breakdown of earnings shows the main contribution - 24.5 per cent - coming
from diamonds. Last year diamonds contributed 29.1 per cent.
Other contributions came from mining finance (21.6 per cent), industry and
commerce (14.3 per cent), gold and uranium (9.4 per cent), platinum and base
metals (9 per cent), financial services and property (8.5 per cent) and coal
(6.4 per cent).
Investment surpluses and other net income contributed 6.3 per cent compared
with 0.3 per cent in 1991.
Mr Ogilvie Thompson said he was optimistic that there was scope for a 'nice
pick-up' in the South African economy.
Attributable earnings per share rose to 724 cents from 604 cents and the
dividend was lifted to 345 cents from 325 cents per share.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sears' executive pay remains modest by the standards of Burton under its old
management: according to its latest annual report and accounts, the entire
board received emoluments worth a mere Pounds 1.6m last year. It is
nevertheless curious that this was a 35 per cent increase on the previous
year. Sears' pre-tax profits fell by 45 and 37 per cent in the last two
years respectively, so there was little by way of performance-related pay in
the directors' pot.
The explanation lies in a series of boardroom expansions and reshufflings
during the year, including an unfortunate six-month period when there were
two chief executives on the pay-roll. Investors will doubtless watch with
interest what happens to directors' pay if the group's much-vaunted recovery
finally gets under way.

So far it looks as though the strong personal income/consumer spending
patterns and weak output/employment trends which marked the first quarter in
the US will be reversed in the second three months. While yesterday's jump
in the widely watched US purchasing managers' index for May to some extent
merely makes up ground lost in April, the advance is nevertheless consistent
with a relatively robust manufacturing recovery. It also suggests that the
US is well ahead of the UK at this stage in the cycle. All six components
showed good gains, with the employment number bolstering hopes that Friday's
eagerly awaited official May job statistics will show an improvement.

FT  02 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Until the government decides just how it intends to privatise British Coal,
there will be rich seams of confusion to mine. It is pertinent, all the
same, to ask what the rumoured quashing of the so-called dash for gas might
mean for the UK electricity industry. The short answer is relatively little.
Arguably, the majority of planned gas stations will never be built anyway,
either because they will not be given permission or, more simply, because
there is not gas to go round.
A more complicated response concerns the consequences for the two generating
companies. On the face of it, they would lose out because their dependence
on coal would remain uncomfortably high. In reality, the impact would
probably be rather more favourable. Assuming Mr Michael Heseltine steps in,
the generators' market share will gain a degree of protection as competitors
fall away. They would also be spared the capital cost of at least three
large gas-fired power stations. In the case of National Power, that could
leave up to Pounds 500m of cash looking for an alternative use.
Perhaps most important, the generators' hands might be strengthened in
negotiations over future contracts with British Coal. They could extract a
higher price for agreeing to take more domestic coal, helped by the
knowledge that the government might also be making plans to dispose of its
remaining 40 per cent stake in them. Thus, the market was probably right to
mark the generators' shares higher yesterday.

FT  02 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Westland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Westland's days as an independent company may be numbered. But there is
still time for those analysts and institutions who wrote the group off as a
basket case to have another look at the shares. Yesterday's 11 per cent
advance in interim pre-tax profits was an impressively solid performance and
demonstrates that the bloated cost base has finally been brought under
control. Margins improved in all divisions, but most notable was the way the
fall in helicopter profits was kept to just 16 per cent, when turnover from
this activity dropped 30 per cent. Helicopter deliveries are currently
running at just 10 a year, a sixth of the level in the mid-1980s.
The bull argument is that Westland is in the middle of a trough from which
it will emerge triumphant in the middle of this decade. Its Sea King and
Lynx will keep profits ticking over for the next couple of years. Thereafter
the market for the EH101 could be enormous. The Ministry of Defence order is
in the bag, but the Italians and Canadians, as well as North Sea operators,
are among those expected to buy. Add in the possibility of a Black Hawk
order from the Saudis and the huge civil order book on the aerospace side,
and the shares more than justify their current year multiple of 13.
The trouble with all this is the timing. The EH101 may occupy an attractive
niche in one of the few defence sectors which is growing. But until the
overseas orders start to materialise the market will doubtless treat the
company's ambitious long-term forecasts with some scepticism.

FT  02 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: The accountants' audit
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by yesterday's figures from the big UK accountants, the Accounting
Standards Board has a strong case for extending its brief. As usual, the
various partnerships declined to volunteer how much they profited from the
vicissitudes of their clients. The largest among them quietly slipped in a
prior-year adjustment to give the appearance of a flat performance, when the
truth was slightly worse. Legal obligations aside, when it comes to
disclosure they are up there with the worst of their clients.
All the same, one gathers that accountants are not much different from other
service companies. Granted, they were late into this recession, while their
greater diversity of operations gave a degree of protection at group level -
Arthur Andersen increased fee income in its consulting business by 30 per
cent. More generally, UK demand for insolvency and tax advice was steady
enough to offset some of the pressure on the basic audit business, while
corporate finance for smaller companies was surprisingly resilient.
Nevertheless, lower corporate activity and increased competition led to some
painful adjustments last year. Price Waterhouse, for example, reduced its UK
cost base by nearly Pounds 30m. In the absence of recovery among its
clients, it is unable to rule out a further round of cuts. But until they
disclose profits, only the partners will know whether they are doing a good
job.

FT  02 JUN 92 / BBC on-air promotion excessive, says MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BBC has been criticised by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission for
excessive on-air promotion of its products.
An MMC report sent to Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade,
calls for a much stricter code of practice to govern on-air promotion by the
corporation.
Mr Heseltine is expected to accept the recommendations of the body, which
investigates potential anti-competitive practices.
The year-long investigation was prompted by the Sadler Report on cross-media
promotion which in March 1991 accused the BBC of 'blatant distortion of
competition' in the promotion of its magazines on BBC television.
IPC, the UK's largest magazine publisher, was among the publishers which
complained about what was seen as unfair competition. The publisher
initiated legal action against the corporation for 'abuse of market
position'.
The MMC has accepted that it is not against the public interest for the BBC
to promote products such as the Radio Times or Good Food magazine on air.
All profits are ploughed back into BBC programmes.
The commission has decided that the scale and impact of such on-air
promotion should be restricted along the lines of the Independent Television
Commission's rules for ITV.
On ITV, details of a book or video can be given at the end of an associated
programme but the mention must be brief and restrict itself to basic
information such as title and price and whether the product is available
through bookshops.
In recent years the BBC has started showing what are in effect glossy
full-blown commercials for its products - a practice which would not be
allowed on ITV.
The MMC has recommended that time limits should be imposed on promotional
material on BBC television and radio and that promotion of a magazine or a
book can come only after the relevant programme. A book or magazine on
gardening, for example, could be promoted only after a gardening programme.
It is not clear whether this compromise will satisfy those who argue that
all BBC promotion is by definition unfair because it involves free
'advertising' for products being sold in competitive markets.
The inquiry by Mr John Sadler, a former MMC member, was triggered by
complaints that Mr Rupert Murdoch's News International titles were abusing
their position by promoting Sky Television.
Mr Sadler decided that, despite owning five national newspapers, News
International was not in a position to 'prevent, restrict or distort'
competition in the newspaper industry.
The Sadler report did, however, recommend that the newspaper industry create
a code of practice on cross-media promotion to cover advertising and
editorial content. No such code has yet been implemented.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Japan to complain to EC over review of relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Japanese government, in an unusual show of anger, plans to send a letter
to the EC this week to complain that a recent Commission review of relations
was 'one-sided' and 'inappropriate'.
The letter, still in draft form, uses far tougher language than the usually
understated Japanese comments on foreign policy issues. The Ministry of
Foreign Affairs argues that a Commission review of relations, delivered late
last month, should have en-hanced the relationship between Brussels and
Tokyo but instead was 'discouraging'.
Japanese anger stems from the Commission's stress on economic issues and
from the tone of the report, which, for example, says the EC 'must convince
Japan' to cut its trade surplus and that direct talks may be needed to open
its markets. The degree of Tokyo's irritation also reflects a deeper
frustration with the Commission's policies and, in the view of Japanese
officials, its neglect of opportunities to im-prove political and cultural
ties.
Japanese officials argue that bureaucrats in Brussels have not noted
improvements in the country's bilateral links with individual EC states.
Tokyo says the Commission report breaches the spirit of a Japan-EC Joint
Declaration signed last year and intended to broaden the relationship beyond
economic issues.
The EC reluctantly signed the declaration, after first demanding that it be
preceded by a more balanced trade relationship.
'Japan had expected the (Commission) communication to be a positive message,
reflecting the on-going co-operation between Japan and the EC based on the
Joint Declaration,' a senior foreign ministry official said. 'However, the
communication raises the concern that it could rather be counter-productive
in promoting the spirit of co-operation growing between Japan and the EC.'
The Tokyo letter will suggest that parts of the document are 'revisionist' -
implying that Japan is different from the rest of the world and needs to be
treated as such.

<TEXT>
Sir, In the debate about whether a statutory audit should be retained for
small companies ('Easing the burden of small company audits', May 28) the
CIMA supports a middle way. By allowing a form of certification by a
qualified accountant, the full panoply of the audit would not be required
while independent assessment would remain as a safeguard. This would not
only be more realistic in balancing such factors as protection of interested
parties and cost, but would bring the UK more into line with other EC
members.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Letter: Rationale for European Central Bank in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID COURTNEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The siting of the proposed European Central Bank is already becoming a
subject of profound and widespread debate across Europe and is one which
will intensify over the coming months. One central issue, agreed upon
unanimously, is that the ECB must be immune from political interference in
order to be truly effective.
With this in mind, it should be made clear that although the ECB should be
politically independent, it cannot be independent of the financial markets
themselves. As such, to locate the ECB anywhere other than in the
best-equipped financial centre would, by definition, be a triumph of
politics over commercial commonsense and would defeat the very basis of this
principle.
In terms of the derivatives markets, London and Liffe must be considered to
be in an unassailable position to accommodate the prospective activities of
the ECB and is clearly able to demonstrate its advantages over its
contemporaries. As initially, the ECB will only be active in interest and
foreign exchange rate management, the primary derivative instruments
underlying this activity will be short-term Ecu interest rate futures and
options.
Given that Liffe is the only exchange upon which this contract is listed at
present and that Liffe also lists similar contracts on several other
European short-term interest rates, its aggregate volume is vastly superior
to any other European derivatives exchange.
The DTB in Germany has no short-term interest rate derivatives listed,
whereas the Matif in Paris, which is the second largest exchange in Europe
in this respect, traded in 1991 the equivalent of just 25 per cent of the
total turnover of the European interest rate contracts recorded on Liffe.
This being true, the home of the ECB, so far as the derivatives markets are
concerned, can surely only be based in London.

FT  02 JUN 92 / The essence of leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOE ROGALY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
President George Bush was at his best during the Gulf war. For a few heady
months the prospect of a Pax Americana in the Middle East shimmered before
our eyes. Now, as the Earth Summit begins in Rio de Janeiro, the US
president is at his worst. He is the elected head of the most powerful
nation. His natural role is to lead us. He alone might have been able to
make a success of Rio. Instead, he has striven to wreck it. What the planet
is getting is not US leadership, but a Pox Americana.
This is not to say that Washington should have signed the lengthy draft
treaties on global warming and biodiversity without demur. There was, and
still is, plenty to argue about. But the head of the single remaining
superpower should have taken the initiative. He was right to brush aside
absurd Third World demands, but he should have replaced them with reasoned
proposals of his own.
A positive treaty curtailing emissions of greenhouse gases, and another
protecting threatened species, could have been shaped to fit US thinking.
Both could have been kept within manageable bounds by going ahead full steam
where the science is clear (on the ozone layer, for example) and sticking to
the precautionary principle where there is imprecision (the greenhouse
effect). Action could have been confined to the use of market mechanisms,
tradable permits, globally-negotiated tax strategies, tied aid, and, where
prohibition is the only answer, universal agreements. Many polluting
industries would prefer the certainties of regulation to life in a market
governed by green consumer pressures. They could have had it.
Mr Bush could have pulled off such an historic deal, had he used his single
most outstanding skill: working the telephone. What he has instead bulldozed
out of the rest of us is a toothless draft on the global threat and, on
preserving plants and animals, a neutered document that the US will now not
sign because the president fears the effect on his domestic biochemical
industries. I say this as an unashamed admirer of the US. We Europeans would
not be enjoying the blessings of a free society if it had not been for the
sacrifices of life and treasure made on our behalf by Americans. It is what
their current administration is doing to our grandchildren that bothers me.
In his foreign policy, Mr Bush represents the finest in the post-1945
American tradition. He is of the old school - Atlanticist, outward-looking,
a skilled diplomat. In his domestic and environmental policies, he looks
like a cheap politician, a buccaneering oilman, a prisoner of the new Right.
The man who promised to be 'the education president' and build a 'gentler
America' has presided, bewildered, over the rioting in Los Angeles; the
candidate who said he would be the 'environmental president' speaks today
like an enemy of the earth.
One reason is that the intellectual pendulum has swung against action by
governments. I was reminded of this by the text of a recent address to the
class of 1992 at Fordham university in the Bronx. The speaker, Dr John
Brademas, is, like Mr Bush, an American of the old school. There the
resemblance ends. Dr Brademas, who is president emeritus of New York
University, was a Democratic congressman from Indiana for 22 years and
majority whip under president Carter. He worked with the liberal Adlai
Stevenson and, as member of a congressional committee, helped draft many of
President Lyndon Johnson's bills establishing the 'Great Society'. In short,
he represents everything that today's conventional wisdom says went wrong in
the 1960s and 1970s. He was swept out of Congress in the 1980 Reagan
landslide.
So why listen to him? Because he has a point. 'The essence of leadership in
a democratic society,' he explained to the Fordham freshers, 'is to persuade
the electorate to do that which they might not as individuals want to do but
know in their hearts they should do for the greater good'. Such an approach
can lose elections, but nobody is seriously advocating that it is always
good campaigning strategy. In office, it is an essential principle.
This is particularly true in the US, whose constitution prevents any one
individual, or body, from exercising dominant control. 'Often, a president's
major challenge is shaping a consensus . . . inside his own administration
before taking that policy to congress and the people,' said Dr Brademas. It
is not only big-government big-spenders who need to do this; conservatives
too fare best, and serve most beneficially, when they seek to lead in a
positive direction.
Mr Bush, like his predecessor, has been hampered by a Democratic Congress,
but that is no reason to abdicate the role of leader. President Ronald
Reagan did not do so - and, for all his shortcomings, he has lived to see
the crumbling of the 'evil empire'. President Bush or his successor must now
strive to ensure that liberal democracy has not triumphed merely to inherit
a desert.

When the Royal Opera House's 'Garden Venture' went public for the first time
in 1989 with six specially commissioned music-theatre pieces, one of the
most successful of a strikingly undistinguished bunch was Priti Paintal's
Survival Song, to a text by Richard Fawkes. Its portrayal of the events
leading up to a necklace killing in a South African township was described
then as a study for a full-length opera on the life of Steven Biko, and the
Garden Venture has gone on to commission that piece; Biko was unveiled in
Birmingham on Friday, directed by Wilfred Judd, artistic director of the
Venture, and conducted by Timothy Lole.
Paintal evidently learnt about Biko through Richard Attenborough's Cry
Freedom, and Fawkes's scenario follows the approximate outline of the first
half of that film. It presents Biko among his family, a man of non-violence
working for the black community despite constant police surveillance,
threats and banning orders; his growing friendship with the journalist
Donald Woods and Woods' attempt to intercede on Biko's behalf with the state
security minister Kruger, and chronicles the escalating harassment, Biko's
arrest, torture and death.
The bare historical facts have a tragic trajectory of their own, but they
are treated here with almost cartoon-like simplicity. Even the character of
Biko is hardly given any perspective, while Woods emerges as a hapless
stooge, unaware of the potential brutality of the state. Too much of the
dialogue is suffocated by banality - Biko surely did not always discuss his
aspirations in such cliches - while the lack of cadence and rhythm creates
insuperable problems for Paintal's word setting, which falls back on the
infuriating tic of repeating every second or third phrase to add emphasis.
Much of the score is slight. The climactic moments of the work - Biko's
unaccompanied monologue in the first act, his torture and murder in the
second - are never underpinned with the musical intensity they demand, and
Paintal's mixture of minimalist washes and Bernstein-like melodic invention
consistently seems underpowered. Only briefly, at the beginning of the
second part when Woods confronts Kruger at his home, does the music begin to
function dramatically; there the dark-hued woodwind solos generate exactly
the kind of ambiguity and unease the situation requires.
Judd's frugal production does what it can, but it is hard to sustain tension
when so much in the music and text appears to be conspiring against it. The
playing from the Endymion Ensemble is vivid and alert, and there are some
fine performances. Daniel Washington makes Biko a highly moral, stoic
figure, and Damon Evans contributes a hyperactive performance as Thomas, the
militant who rejects Biko's strategy of non-violence; Hyacinth Nicholls is
Biko's wife Ntsiki, Angela Caesar the family friend Miriam. Stephen
Richardson's portrayal of Woods seems intentionally shallow and naive, while
Gerard Quinn and Stephen Austin are the security police; as Kruger too,
Quinn gets a second chance to polish his Afrikaner accent.
In the end Biko neither rises to the importance of its subject matter nor
leaves the impression of a rounded piece of music theatre even on its own
limited dramatic terms. As the first fully ripened fruit from the Garden
Venture it is a disappointment; Judd's claim in the programme that the
project is now well established as 'the prime mover in developing new opera
in the UK' still needs to be taken with a pretty large pinch of salt.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Arts: Musicians who miss the Wigmore - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN and PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Only four months to go. During the Wigmore Hall's year-long closure various
of the other musical venues in London have been putting on recitals, but
none has been able to offer the combination of intimate acoustics and
friendly atmosphere which makes that hall so precious.
From time to time the Barbican endeavours to promote itself again as a
recital hall and the past year has been a clear opportunity. The sound is
perhaps less poor for chamber-music than one might have feared, as the
acoustic gains in clarity as the number of players gets smaller. But nothing
can stop the hall looking and sounding empty when there is only a handful of
people on stage.
For the celebrity recital by the Takacs Quartet Barbican last Wednesday no
attempt was made to disguise the chilliness of the setting. The players sat
centre-stage, surrounded by a vast expanse of deserted platform. The upper
tiers of the auditorium looked to have been closed off. At quiet moments the
sound became unhelpfully distant and it was fortunate that so fine a group
was playing, as the audience was compelled to sit in silence.
This is a quartet with the ability to make its presence felt in any hall.
The players' tone is well matched, their style unexaggerated. Warmth and
lyricism are their hallmarks, although just occasionally there was a
seasoning of their native Hungarian paprika in Bartok's First Quartet and
also the scherzo of Haydn's B Flat Quartet, Op. 76 No. 4, where the vigorous
stamping rhythm was taken up rather noisily by the leader's left foot.
In their performance of Schubert's 'Death and the Maiden' Quartet neurosis
was held at bay. Where the Lindsay Quartet seizes the music by the throat,
or the Amadeus was wiry and tensile, the Takacs still find time to shape
broad lyrical phrases (the elegiac opening of the slow movement was coloured
with particular sensitivity). The players will be hosting their own festival
at the Wigmore Hall in 1994, so they clearly recognise where their true
London home lies.
A word of recommendation, too, for the Beethoven Trio, who gave the first of
three recitals at the Purcell Room on Friday. Each of these programmes
features a new work by an Austrian composer together with Mozart and
Beethoven trios, for which the players are winning an increasing reputation
at home and abroad.
To judge from the standard of performance in this first recital there is no
reason to question those high opinions. The Beethoven Trio is a meeting of
three equal musicians, less dominated by the pianist than is often the case
in more starry ensembles, a trio of young and fresh interpreters, able to
build long paragraphs of music into statements of some depth and import.
The new work on this occasion was Gerhard Schedl's Second Piano Trio,
subtitled 'Lamento', which takes the music of the two Armed Men from
Mozart's Die Zauberflote and sets isolated phrases from it afloat in a sea
of vaguely expressionist sounds: not a piece of strong individual merit,
although at 10 minutes it did not outstay its welcome. The third and final
recital, with a new work by Thomas Pernes, follows on Friday.
                           *       *      *
In a Purcell Room agreeably tarted up with paintings from the Arts Council
collection, including Gillian Eyres's eye-catching 'Spica' and a yellow and
blob-red Caulfield, the English tenor Adrian Thompson and pianist Iain
Burnside gave a recital on Thursday, fifth in a song series which would
normally be staged, one presumes, in the Wigmore Hall.
Certainly the Wigmore acoustics would have been more accommodating to Mr
Thompson's searingly powerful instrument. He makes a clarion sound which is
apt to go frantic with decibels in upper register climaxes and produce a
cuttingly painful effect in the confinement of the Purcell Room, which oddly
seems to stop the voice dead without muting it.
Passionate and in many ways persuasive, Mr Thompson's recital problem was
sheer vocal bulk. From the start he was overwhelming his pianist as well as
flattening his listeners in a Schubert group, though the passionate,
storm-lashed Der Schiffer (The Boatman) positively benefited from the
ferocious despatch. Among a selection of Hugo Wolf's Morike settings, Der
Tambour, a drummer boy's fantasy of food, and Storchenbotschaft
(Stork-tidings), with its bitonal piano part figuring the shepherd's creaky
hut (and anticipating the methods of Britten), made a vivid impression. An
eine Aolsharfe (To an Aeolian Harp) received a strong, solemn delivery.
I found the five Gerald Finzi songs after the interval dullish, and the four
Samuel Barber's not much less so: Sure on this Shining Night sets words by
James Agee but isn't a patch on Knoxville. Mr Thompson came on in chef's
togs for Leonard Bernstein's Faure send-up, La bonne cuisine, the four
song-texts being French recipes.
The 33-year old Russian conductor Yakov Kreizberg (he emigrated to the USA
in 1976) made his London debut on Sunday night with the Philharmonia
Orchestra at the Royal Festival Hall in an all-Russian programme. It was not
an exceptionally interesting programme, but Kreizberg made it uncommonly
gripping and the orchestra's playing was of the highest stylishness
throughout.
The Polonaise from Tchaikovsky's opera Eugene Onegin was a brief but
cracking opener and its brilliant bluster was no sooner in our ears than
forcibly contradicted by the bleak depression of Shostakovich's second cello
concerto, Op. 126, a late work written for Rostropovich in 1966 between the
thirteenth and fourteenth symphonies.
Our soloist was the American Lynn Harrell (in the news because of his
appointment as next principal of the Royal Academy of Music), and no more
searching or finely shaped interpretation could have been asked for.
Harrell's tone is as clear as it is expressive, as minutely governed as it
is boldly (and with seeming effortlessness) projected. Shostakovich's
invention is not perhaps of the most distinguished in this work, which is
just a very good performance 'on the Shostakovich'; but Harrell read in a
marvellous intensity everywhere and the orchestra answered Kreizberg's
evident commitment with a high-tension accompaniment notable for individual
excellences (the sturdy peculiar horn calls at the end of the first
movement, the split-second demented xylophone interjections of the scherzo)
as well as formidable group cohesiveness.
Kreizberg cuts an impressive figure on the podium: unflamboyant but intense,
dapper but keenly effectual. His account of Rakhmaninov's second symphony
was beautiful, profoundly persuasive (the work can easily become a romantic
thrash) and, in its slow movement, quite overwhelming. The string textures
of the slow introduction were built up with glistening precision, and brass
layers superadded with a disciplined ear for balance. The performance of the
scherzo was masterly; one blessed Kreizberg for the tiny touches of violin
portamento. Michael Whight's quiet, poised clarinet solo in the spacious
Adagio took our breath away, if not his; and the movement went its noble way
'among the deepening shades'.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
David Brown, the specialist engineers, has found a new chairman to help
steer it towards a probable stock market flotation during the course of next
year.
Derek Kingsbury captained the management buy-out of Fairey, another
specialised engineering group, in 1986, taking it public two years later.
Chris Cook and Chris Brown, joint managing directors of David Brown, felt
his background fitted the company for which they put together an MBO in
January 1990.
He replaces Tony Firth, chairman and chief executive of Concentric, who
resigned as chairman of David Brown in the middle of last year. 'It is often
very difficult as chairman of a private company to know what you are doing
there' says Cook philosophically, adding that both sides parted company
'very amicably' as work pressures at Concentric built up for Firth.
Kingsbury, who was headhunted for the position, should be clearer as to what
his remit is, largely because the company's future refinancing strategy is
now emerging, according to Cook. 'The new chairman will be at the forefront
of the refinancing.' A stock market flotation is at the top of the list of
priorities for refinancing in the course of the next two years.
Kingsbury, 65, has been at Fairey since 1982, and was previously deputy
chief executive of Dowty. He was a non- executive director of Vickers until
1991.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Business Law: Cadbury Committee draft offers mixed news for
stakeholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN PIERS and MARGO MACGILLIVRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The publication of the Cadbury Committee's draft report on corporate
governance last week will have been met with sighs of relief in company
boardrooms and accountancy firms.
Shareholders, investors, lenders and lawyers may take a more cynical view of
the Committee's proposed voluntary code of practice. The Committee tacitly
accepts that the code will probably not work, and warns of legislation if
there has been widespread abuse and non-compliance when it comes to review
the situation in two years time.
The news media had predicted that the Committee, made up of the great and
the good, would inevitably produce ineffectual recommendations for fear of
radical change.
The Committee concedes that if the code fails to command support (adherence)
then pressure will bring 'legislation and external regulation which will be
less effective than the approach we recommend'. Regrettably, it fails to
explain why legislation will be less effective, resorting only to an
expressed desire not to inhibit flexibility or stifle 'entrepreneurial
drive'.
The reality is that proper corporate governance requires both the spirit of
compliance which the Committee hopes for and the teeth of accountability
within a legal framework.
The inadequacies and failures of self-regulation and voluntary codes of
practice witnessed in the host of frauds, scandals and failures in the UK
over the last 10 years, leaves the observer questioning whether there might
be something quintessentially British about the Committee's navete.
Contrast the British position with that of the pragmatic Australians, who
are debating their Corporate Law Reform Bill 1992. The Australians propose
to reject voluntary codes of practice in favour of laws imposing greater
duties on company directors and officers.
Should that bill become law, among other things, directors in Australia
would be obliged to: seek adequate information and make proper enquiries
about their company's affairs; exercise independent judgment; vet
professional advisers; scrutinise conflicts of interest of directors and
management; and ensure the adequacy of, and compliance with, reporting and
internal control procedures. Disqualification and heavy fines are proposed
to encourage compliance.
Not that direct British legislative intervention in this area is without
precedent. The 1986 Insolvency Act and the Company Directors
Disqualification Act introduced a revolutionary new framework governing
directors' responsibilities and liabilities arising out of the insolvency of
their companies.
So why should proper corporate governance not be the subject of a new
Companies Bill? Perhaps it will be, in any event, as a result of the
proposed European Community Fifth Company Law Directive. The British
government might have been better employed in trying to secure a level
playing field through negotiation, than by strongly resisting all change
through this directive.
The principal outcome of the Committee's draft report is the fundamental
change in the role and significance of the non-executive director.
A company's audit committee and (mainly) remuneration committee should now
be made up of non-executive directors. Most of them should be independent
and their remuneration should reflect the time committed to the company's
affairs. Their calibre and number should ensure that their views carry
significant weight in all decisions and they should be selected formally by
the board.
Admirable sentiments, no doubt, but, in the absence of strict regulations,
mere wishful thinking. Who, for example, is to decide on 'calibre'? Answer:
the board, where the executive directors command a majority.
The Committee's recommendations are steps in the right direction. But, if
the government is to attempt to address the problems which led to the
Maxwell, Polly Peck, BCCI and other recent scandals, then new rules in a
legal framework are required.
It is not sufficient, for example, to recommend a division of responsibility
and a balance of power at the head of the company so that no individual has
unvetted powers, without prohibiting the chairman from also being chief
executive.
The duty to disclose salary and performance-related elements of pay should
not be limited to the chairman and the highest-paid director. It should
encompass all directors and those operating through service companies and
consultancies (as does the Australian draft bill).
Disclosure of audit and non-audit work recommended by the Committee
highlights but fails to address the inherent conflict facing auditors. The
Committee describes the annual audit as 'one of the cornerstones of
corporate governance' but the problem of the widespread discounting of audit
fees aimed at providing accountancy firms with a platform from which to
provide their numerous other, more lucrative services, will not be solved
merely by this greater disclosure and the rotation of audit partners.
The draft report relies on a voluntary code, influential, experienced and
diligent non-executive directors and an accountancy profession where the
duties to inform and protect the investor (and consequently the
creditor/lender) outweigh the need to maintain client goodwill and
satisfaction necessary to sell services more profitably than auditing.
A recommendation that the maximum length of service agreements which do not
require shareholders' consent should be reduced from five to three years is
welcome. The Committee accepts this will require legislative amendment but
prefers the voluntary code elsewhere to retain 'the essential spirit of
enterprise'.
Similarly, the proposal that directors state in their report in the annual
accounts that the business is a going concern (with supporting assumptions
and qualifications) is a good one, but it too will require legislative
amendment and should apply to all companies, and not just listed ones.
Clear statements of the functions and duties of the directors and the
auditors in company accounts will not necessarily close 'the expectation
gap' between what the law dictates as the reliance entitled to be placed on
filed accounts and the use made of them in commercial life.
By not recommending the reversal of the House of Lords decision on auditors'
liability in the Caparo case (which limited reliance to the company itself
through its board and the shareholders as a whole), the Committee adhered to
the policy of keeping the floodgates of litigation firmly shut.
Indemnity insurers, both for auditors' errors omissions insurance and
directors' and officers' liability insurance, will have been comforted by
the absence of radical recommendations and the voluntary nature of the
proposed code.
Shareholders, investors and creditors will have been disappointed that just
when the spectacular corporate failures of recent years cried out for bold
and imaginative legal reform, the body from which so much had been expected
came up with a little tinkering and a voluntary code.

Ladieswear retailer Alexon has promoted Peter Ridsdale, who joined the group
last September, onto the main board.
Ridsdale explains his job, as managing director of Alexon Brands, was
essentially already a main board position, but that the company had no doubt
wanted to 'wait and see that I was OK.' He came to Alexon as Ruth Henderson
was made chief executive.
'It has been an interesting year from the rivalry point of view' he says,
referring to the fact that he is a director of Leeds United football club
whereas the chairman (Lawrence Snyder) is ' a fanatical Manchester United
supporter'.
However, it is the changes Ridsdale has been putting in train - including a
sharper focusing on individual brands together with what he calls a drive
for 'value for money' - that have earned him a place on the now four-strong
board.
At Burton, where he had been since 1985 before coming to Alexon, Ridsdale
had latterly been managing director of Evans and the discount chain 'Is'.
Earlier in his career he worked in personnel for Schering Plough and
DelMonte International.

Alan Howard, deputy chairman of Etam, has died at the age of 54. He had been

Technically Speaking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Advertisements for notebook computers are so exotic. They usually feature
Club Class man, dashing from office to airport, from airport to hotel -
always with his little electronic wonder under his arm, ready to perform
wherever he goes, set to plug in to data banks anywhere in the world.
Would it were so. Alas, in reality, use of notebook computers continues to
be stymied by the protectionist designs of the world's electrical and
telecoms utilities.
In the past year I have struggled with a variety of electrical and telecom
sockets in Japan, India, Austria, Switzerland, France, Britain, Canada and
the US, and have more than once been tempted to stomp my little wonder to
bits.
Electricity is the life blood of notebook personal computers because
batteries tend to be short lived. But the globetrotting PC user had better
be prepared for trouble of two kinds.
The first is voltage, which varies from 100 to 240 in the above-mentioned
countries. Some PCs come with a converter that adjusts automatically. Others
are not so well equipped, so two converters may have to be carried.
The second problem is the plethora of plug-socket standards around the
world. This has been largely solved by the design of universal adaptors
available in most airports.
But be warned - the Swiss have out-smarted even them, with a recessed,
lozenge-shaped socket good only for their very own three-pronged plugs.
Telecoms companies too have been imaginative. The introduction of plug-in
telephones dates back about 30 years, but their spread outside of North
America is much more recent. Still, only Japan, among the countries I have
experienced, took the sensible route of adopting the US-Canadian RJ standard
plug-socket system. This is sensible because most modems are equipped with
RJ sockets.
The easiest way to get around this problem is to buy a cable that has an RJ
plug at one end and the local plug at the other. These are not always easy
to find (and in some countries are illegal), but often at international
conferences, embarrassed reps of the local PTT can be seen handing them out
to frazzled foreign PC users.
Thus, our globetrotting club class man probably needs a second suitcase
filled with an array of plugs, sockets, adaptors, converters and cables.
Even then, his problems may not be over.
The Swiss PTT, among others, transmits high-pitched tones that record the
passing of each charge segment during a customer's call. Most users are not
aware of them because the beep is suppressed on Swiss PTT-approved
telephones. But they play havoc with PC modems. You have to buy a special
cable equipped with what is called a 'tax impulse filter' to get rid of
them.
You can avoid carrying around a suitcase full of spaghetti if you are
willing to spend a bit of time opening up telephone junction boxes and
attaching wires from your computer. In preparation for this trespassing,
take a cable with an RJ plug at one end and expose the wires at the other.
All telephone circuits around the world are basically the same, consisting
of only two wires. Many PTTs try and confuse the would-be trespasser by
surrounding them with several other wires, but it takes only a short time to
sus out the real ones.
Another gambit that worked in Delhi once was to use the telecom line
attached to a facsimile machine. Most facsimile machines, like modems, are
equipped with an RJ socket, so it is simply a matter of pulling out the plug
from the fax machine and putting it into the modem.
I read an article recently claiming that a US telecoms company was beginning
to install coin boxes equipped with an RJ socket specifically for the mobile
PC user. It sounded too good to be true. Perhaps it was written by a PC user
with a vivid imagination. Or perhaps I was dreaming.

How to get a better deal from their bank manager is a problem which has
puzzled many small business owners in recent months. The banks' large
provisions on small business lending has led many of them to take a tougher
line with customers.
The Director's Guide to Getting the best from your Bank* provides no magic

hate surprises and that keeping your bank manager informed is the best
policy.
The most valuable sections of this booklet, published jointly by the

that banks can provide in the fields of payroll management and how to manage
foreign currency and interest rate risks.
Other useful chapters explain credit control and factoring and financial

important factor - In a nutshell
</HEADLINE>

Nine out of 10 small businesses believe the government does not do enough to
help them either by providing finance or advice, according to a survey of
140 companies which made use of factoring. The survey was carried out by
Lombard NatWest Commercial Services, the factoring subsidiary of NatWest
Bank.
Companies under a year old were more satisfied with government help than
those between one and three years old, possibly reflecting the publicity
given to schemes for small and start-up enterprises and a lack of assistance
for better established business.
Asked to list policy initiatives which the government should take to help
small firms, business owners' highest priority was for a cut in interest
rates followed by legislation for the prompt payment of bills, a reduction
in the VAT rate and increased public spending.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Management (The Growing Business): What's in a name? -
Choosing the right title for your company is no simple matter although it
can make all the difference between commercial success or failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Don Gooding changed the name of his west London travel agency from
Budget Travel to Caribbean Gold, business took off.
As Budget Travel, the company had appeared to be just another of the many
cut-rate outlets on the high street instead of a specialised agency
providing holiday packages to Barbados and the Caribbean.
'People could not reconcile paying Pounds 5,000 for a holiday through a
company which called itself Budget,' he says. 'People just walked right past
us to one of the other travel agents.'
The name change was not the only element in Caribbean Gold's new image. It
was just one part of a marketing review, undertaken under the government's
Enterprise Initiative, which led to improved financial systems, training for
the company's 10 staff and a complete refurbishment of the agency.
But it was a significant factor in an increase in turnover from less than
Pounds 3m to nearly Pounds 5m in the middle of a recession.
It also played a key role in emphasising that the eight-year-old company
specialised in a particular part of the world and that it offered a quality
service.
As Gooding found out, choosing a name for your business is not a simple
matter. The start-up company in particular does not always know which
products or which markets will develop fastest and whether its original
title will still appeal or be relevant.
Entrepreneurs sometimes name their business after their wives or their
children or after the street in which they start up.
'Choosing a name can be very unscientific,' says Mark Pavan, founder of
MAPA, a London marketing consultancy.
'It is often very emotive. People don't research it properly and can cause
themselves severe embarrassment if they choose a name which is already being
used by someone else.'
'People must think through the strategic and personal implications,' warns
John Murphy, chairman of Interbrand, a London consultancy which devises
names. 'They must not choose a name which they cannot protect or which is
not suitable for international markets.'
Murphy has recently been advising two service companies which have chosen
lengthy titles made up of the names of their founders and friends.
'I think it will end in tears later because some of them will leave and
realise that their name is still in the business's title.'
Technical names can frequently trip up the unwary. Derek Clissold set up in
business making speciality chemicals five years ago as Chiral Organics.
Chiral was a technical term which was readily understandable to the chemists
to whom Clissold expected to sell his products but meant less to the
bio-chemists who actually turned out to be his customers.
The bio-chemistry market also proved more promising so Clissold changed the
name of his Reading-based company to Cascade Biochem, a reference to the
cascade of effects which lead to a particular disease.
If Chiral Organics was too specific a name, Immunology Ltd found that its
name appeared too general. If the 'Ltd' was left off, there was a danger
that the company would become confused with the general scientific term.
So Immunology changed its name to Cantab Pharmaceuticals Research to reflect
its geographical base (Cantab is abbreviated Latin for Cambridge) and its
sphere of activity.
In choosing - or changing - a name, a company must first check that it is
not already in use. It should carry out a search at Companies House and also
check the trade marks register of the Patent Office. Trade mark protection
is more effective than simple company registration, says Murphy.
A business will not be able to register a name which is considered offensive
or illegal and nor can it make use of terms such as Royal, National,
Building Society or Bank without fulfilling certain conditions or conforming
to regulations governing the sector.
But even thorough research and registration do not provide absolute
guarantees against difficulties. Cathy Ridley did a careful search before
starting up her company relocation business under the Move Plan title six
years ago. She began as a sole trader but on the advice of her patent agent
registered the name with Companies House in case she ever decided to become
a limited company.
After five years in business, she discovered that another company was using
the Move Plan name. A letter to this company pointing out that the name was
already registered produced no result so Ridley went to court.
Earlier this year a judge issued an interim injunction ordering the other
company to stop using the name.
But Ridley says the Pounds 15,000 of legal costs incurred and the time she
spent fighting the case were a heavy burden on a businesses with just Pounds
300,000 of turnover and a full-time workforce of four.
Before deciding on a company name, the founders should decide what
personality they want their business to project, advises Murphy. 'You must
decide whether you want your business to be thought of as being high-tech,
strong and incisive, caring, British, Italian . . .' he says.
Consultancies such as Interbrand tend to work mainly for large companies but
they do have smaller clients, says Murphy.
A typical name-creation assignment would cost between Pounds 10,000 and
Pounds 19,000, he says, although the search for an international name in a
crowded and difficult market such as computing might rise to Pounds
50,000-Pounds 60,000.
Company names can be chosen in four broad categories, says John Abram, joint
founder of Abram, Hawkes Associates, a Haywards Heath-based marketing
consultancy.
They can be based on the names of the founders; they can be descriptive;
they can be witty, involving, for example, a play on words; or they can be
anonymous, consisting of a made-up name or initials.
All four can bring problems. The founders may move on; descriptive titles
may lose their relevance or become restrictive; witty titles may become
tiresome; while made-up names and initials can be difficult to inject with
personality.
Whatever name is chosen, it cannot project an image which is not backed up
by the company's performance, warns Abram. A business which is seen by its
customers as old-fashioned and parochial will not persuade them it is run by
international high-flyers just by changing its name.
Companies should therefore be very careful before they decide on a name
change, the experts advise. 'You must first think what problem you are
trying to solve,' says Abram.
'Often it is no more than a vague message from the chairman's office that
the company name is no longer modern enough. You must have a good reason for
making a change. A name change can appear superficially attractive but it
can cause a lot of problems.'

FT  02 JUN 92 / Minister challenges private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN, Public Policy Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT plans to put Civil Service functions out to competitive tender
offer the private sector enormous opportunities to market services, Mr
William Waldegrave, minister of public service and science, said yesterday.
Private concerns would have to improve their quality of service, though, if
people became accustomed to a higher quality of service in the public
sector.
Mr Waldegrave said: 'There are an increasing number of public-sector
organisations providing services that could put some private sector
organisations in the shade.'
Speaking at a conference in London organised by The Sunday Times, he
reaffirmed the government's commitment to improving public services.
Competitive tendering had improved the quality and cost-effectiveness of
many local government services, he said. Now up to one in four Civil Service
jobs might be put out to tender.
Breaking away from nationally determined pay scales was another essential
step in improving public services.
Mr Waldegrave said he wanted to break down the barriers between the public
and private sectors. There should be 'parity of esteem' between them, based
on rival and complementary excellences.

FT  02 JUN 92 / International league of awards led by Britain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JIMMY BURNS and ANDREW SLADE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN LEADS the international league in the diversity of honours and the
automatic way they are awarded in certain sectors, notably the Civil
Service.
The US president gives out 'medals of freedom' and Congress has a few awards
for people engaged in 'conspicuous good works'. As one US embassy official
put it, however, the granting of such honours is a 'rarity, not a routine'.
France's Legion d'Honneur was created by Napoleon in 1802, and has five
grades: chevaliers (knights), officiers, commandeurs, grands officiers and
grand-croix.
In peacetime, to become a knight, 20 years' service is required by civil
servants and armed forces personnel, or 25 years in professional service.
The medals handed out are not as numerous as in Napoleon's time, and numbers
of recipients for the top four grades are strictly limited.
Although the legion is awarded by the president, its grades are strictly
separated and regulated. Chevaliers can become officiers only after they
have been a chevalier for eight years; commandeurs must be an officier for
five years; grands officers must be commandeurs for three years; and holders
of the grand-croix must have held the rank of grand officier for three
years.
The order cannot be awarded to serving parliamentarians during their term of
office; neither can they be promoted during that time, unless as a result of
military service.
There is a Bastille Day - July 14 - honours list. Last year, recipients
included jazz trumpeter Miles Davis and actress Sophia Loren (both made
knights), and US Gulf war commander General Norman Schwarzkopf, who became a
grand officier.
More controversially, Lt Col (then Major) Alain Mafart, a member of a French
secret service team convicted of bombing the Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior
in Auckland harbour in 1985, was created chevalier in July last year.
Protests from New Zealand were brushed off with a French statement that
almost everyone with the appropriate service receives the award.
Germany brought in its honours system in 1949 with the creation of the
federal republic. Like France, it has one main award - the Federal Cross of
Merit - with varying grades.
In Spain, King Juan Carlos can create hereditary marqueses, dukes and
counts. He has created 18 such grand titles since becoming king in 1976.
Recipients include musicians, intellectuals, and democratically elected
politicians.

HUNDREDS of millions of dollars have been pledged to alleviate southern
Africa's drought, relief officials said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Geneva.
'The menace of widespread suffering and death which hangs over southern
Africa is no abstract issue, no idle concept,' the United Nations
under-secretary for humanitarian affairs, Mr Jan Eliasson, told the opening
session of a two-day aid conference.
The UN and southern African nations, excluding South Africa, organised the
conference to gather responses to a joint appeal they made last week for
Dollars 835m (Pounds 464m) for one of the region's worst droughts.
Pledges announced yesterday were difficult to sort out since some of the
figures included already scheduled aid, but it appeared more than half the
appeal had been met. The US announced it was giving Dollars 382m in drought
relief on top of normal development assistance of about Dollars 275m. The
European Community announced it was giving Dollars 276m in food aid, about
half of which was in addition to normal aid.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Iraq condemns UN border proposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROGER MATTHEWS, Middle East Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IRAQ WARNED yesterday that UN proposals for a new border with Kuwait would
'create a permanent nucleus for tension' in the region.
Mr Ahmed Hussein al-Samaraei, the Iraqi foreign minister, said yesterday in
a letter to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary-general, that 'the
decisions taken by the Iraq-Kuwait border demarcation commission are
illegitimate and constitute a dangerous precedent in the history of the
international organisation'.
The findings by the commission, which have yet to be ratified by the
Security Council, recommend returning to Kuwait the land at Umm Qasr on
which Iraq has during the past 20 years built a naval base. Three jetties
used by the Iraqi navy would revert to Kuwait but the deep-water commercial
port will remain in Iraqi hands.
In addition, the UN commission has re-commended that a strip of territory in
the Rumailah oilfield containing several producing wells should be given
back to Kuwait. Iraq accused Kuwait of illegally taking oil from the field
shortly before its invasion in August 1990.
At both Umm Qasr and Rumailah the UN commission found that Iraq had since
1963 encroached on what was Kuwaiti territory. Had Kuwait chosen to press
its case more strongly for a further portion of the Umm Qasr port it is
likely that the commission would have found in its favour.
Iraq's limited access to the sea has been a cause of repeated conflict with
its neighbours. In September 1980 it abrogated the 1975 Algiers agreement
with Iran on the joint use of the Shatt al-Arab waterway just before
launching its eight-year war with Tehran.
Iraq's warning to the UN yesterday indicates how the commission's findings
on the border with Kuwait will be used by President Saddam Hussein as a
nationalist rallying point and as a further example of his contention that
his country's troubles are primarily the responsibility of the western
powers.

JAPAN'S individual bankruptcies soared to 23,491 in 1991, double that of the
previous year, reflecting sharp increases in insolvencies because of
consumer loans.
The figure, compiled by the Management and Co-ordination Agency, also
reflects a surge of defaults on credit card loans and purchases by the
younger generation.
Individual bankruptcies, have become a social issue with many older Japanese
shocked as traditional frugality has given way to materialism.
According to the Japan Credit Counselling Association, consumers in their
20s accounted for 49 per cent of assistance given in 1990.
Credit extended to Japanese consumers during 1991 through consumer loans and
credit card purchases totalled an estimated Y65,600bn, (Pounds 280bn) three
times higher than 10 years ago.
Credit card companies have yet to reach agreement with the government on
methods of implementing stricter checks on credit information.
Japanese vehicle sales fell in May for the 13th month in succession,
compounding fears that the end of the recession is not yet in sight for the
hard-pressed Japanese motor industry, Stefan Wagstyl writes.
Sales dropped 12.3 per cent from a year before, the biggest decline since
1984.
The decline was particularly severe for small passenger cars, for which
sales fell 19.5 per cent.

   BONN, BERLIN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DRAMATIC reductions in pollutant emissions in western Germany demonstrate
clearly that 'consistent policies can break the link between economic growth
and environmental damage', Mr Klaus Topfer, environment minister said
yesterday.
As delegations converged on Rio de Janeiro for the start tomorrow of the
Earth Summit, West Germany revealed that between 1970 and 1989, when its
gross domestic product rose 56 per cent, emissions of sulphur dioxide, dust
and carbon monoxide had fallen 73 per cent, 75 per cent and 43 per cent
respectively.
Despite the inclusion of the former East Germany in the latest reckonings,
output of carbon dioxide had continued to fall: from 1,064m tonnes in 1987
to 997m tonnes in 1990 and 980m tonnes in 1991, the minister added.
Speaking at the launch of the first environmental audit of united Germany,
Mr Topfer attributed improvements in the east to the prompt closure of
outdated factories.
However, he said, there was still room for improvement. Increasing road
traffic had led to a 12.5 per cent increase in emissions of oxides of
nitrogen (NOx). Difficulties were emerging as more east Germans bought cars
and as improved roads in the east prompted industry to switch from rail and
river transport to lorries.
Backed by Mr Heinrich von Lersner, president of the federal environment
office, he proposed stricter monitoring of lorry speeds on German roads.
Heavy fuel consumption in trucks was tending to cancel out advantages won by
installing 'scrubbers' on power stations and catalysers on cars.
Family cars were also still using too much petrol - an average of more than
10 litres per 100km - and Mr Topfer called on manufacturers to reduce this
to around 6 litres by 2005. He refused to comment on proposals that vehicle
fuel consumption and pollution could be greatly reduced by imposing a
motorway speed limit of 130kmph.
However, while the sulphur dioxide content of the air in the
heavily-industrialised Ruhr region in the west had fallen from 250
micrograms per cubic metre to less than 50 in the past 20 years, in Leipzig,
in the east, it was still as bad as in the Ruhr 30 years ago, he said.
East Germany's obsolescent chemicals industry, one of the largest employers
in the region, has been granted more than DM600m (Pounds 204m) by the
Treuhand agency as part of a DM2bn programme this year to clean up the
massively-polluted production sites, writes Leslie Colitt in Berlin. The
Treuhand hopes the investments of DM338m in the Buna company and DM293m in
the Leuna company will improve chances of attracting wary western investors.
Mr Franz Wauschkuhn, an agency spokesman, said the money would be used to
clean up environmental damage caused by the previous use of brown coal as a
feedstock, as well as for water purification and repairs to machinery.
A French-German consortium of Elf Acquitaine and Thyssen Handelsunion is to
build a refinery at the Leuna site near Leipzig, but no investors have been
found for its chemicals production.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN federal and provincial officials will spend the next week seeking
to break an impasse in protracted national unity talks aimed at forestalling
the separatist movement in Quebec.
Talks broke off at the weekend with deep rifts among the nine
English-speaking provinces. Failure to break the deadlock soon may leave Mr
Brian Mulroney, prime minister, with little choice but to call a national
referendum on the federal government's favoured proposals.
Mr Joe Clark, constitutional affairs minister, and his provincial
counterparts had met over the past three months in an attempt to craft a new
constitution before a self-imposed deadline of May 31.
Ottawa is keen to present a package of constitutional reforms to Quebec well
before October, when the Francophone province is scheduled to hold its own
referendum. Although support for independence has recently waned, there is
concern that separatist fervour could be reignited by failure among the
other nine provinces to agree a package acceptable to Quebec.
Among the thorniest issues is reform of the Senate, the upper house of
parliament. There is consensus that the body, which at present consists
entirely of appointed members, should be elected.
But several western and Atlantic provinces, led by Alberta, are pushing  -
against opposition from Ontario and Quebec - for a body with wide powers and
equal representation from each province. Alberta insists it will not accede
to some of Quebec's key demands unless its Senate reform proposals are
accepted.
The federal government, which is keen to bring negotiations to a decisive
end, has been pressing ahead with preparations for a national referendum, a
last-ditch solution. Parliament passed an enabling bill last month and the
government has launched a national advertising blitz aimed at promoting
national unity.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Amnesty critical of Peru regime
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMNESTY International, the human rights group, said yesterday that human
rights violations had continued in Peru since President Alberto Fujimori
took power nearly two years ago, writes Stephen Fidler, Latin America
Editor.
'Widespread 'disappearances' and extra-judicial executions by the security
forces, as well as torture, continued to be the organisation's principal
concerns in Peru,' it said.
In the first 21 months of the Fujimori government, 392 people reported as
'disappeared' remained unaccounted for after arrest. There were 169
extra-judicial executions.
The group was also critical of measures taken since Mr Fujimori dissolved
Congress on April 5, which it said undermined the structures by which the

FT  02 JUN 92 / Business as usual at Anglo-Yugoslavia
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Anglo-Yugoslavia, a Yugoslav bank operating in London, said yesterday it was
carrying on with business as usual after the Bank of England and Treasury
had confirmed that it was regarded as a UK resident bank, writes David
Barchard.
Mr Michael Cowdrey, deputy managing director, said the bank, with a balance
sheet of about Pounds 70m, was subject to applying the same sanctions
against Serbia and Montenegro as any other bank in the UK. This may pose
some problems as Anglo-Yugoslavia is mainly owned by Serbian and Montenegrin
institutions.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Master Slovak politician shakes the federalist foundation:
The word 'independence' may be avoided, but the rhetoric is unambiguous
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARIANE GENILLARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDING in the medieval square of the small town of Banska Stvianica in
central Slovakia, Mr Vladimir Meciar, the most popular politician in the
republic, works the crowd with the well-trained techniques he learned in his
boxing career. His large silhouette positioned beneath the statue of Saint
Sebastian, he answers written questions allegedly gathered from the crowd.
In well-prepared verbal blows, Mr Meciar displays his wit as he blends
political slogans with well-timed jokes about his enemies.
An expected winner in Friday's elections for the regional republic's
parliament, the Slovak National Council, he knows when to strike. Since
joining the opposition in the assembly after a spell as regional prime
minister a year ago, his popularity increased in parallel with the growth of
nationalism in Slovakia, the smaller of the two republics in the
Czechoslovak federation.
With an average 30 per cent support in the opinion polls for his party, the
Movement for a Democratic Slovakia, and support from other smaller parties,
he represents the greatest threat facing the federation since the demise of
communism. He shouts to the crowd: 'I told Mr Havel (the federal president)
that we will no longer ask him what to do]' The people of Banska Stvianica
applaud enthusiastically.
The party's programme calls on the Slovak parliament to declare the
republic's sovereignty. He has also promised to push through a constitution
which would take precedence over the federal one. He says that a referendum
would then be put 'if the Czechs and Slovaks continue to disagree'.
Representatives of the Czech and Slovak governments have been unable to
agree a post-communist relationship. As negotiations continued to fail and
Slovakia's unemployment rate soared to three times that of neighbouring
Czech lands, nationalists fuelled the growing resentment against the federal
government.
The Movement for a Democratic Slovakia receives between 25 and 34 per cent
in the various opinion polls, but his policies also have the backing of
other parties with which he might be able to construct a parliamentary
majority. Moreover, together they could put together a strong bloc in the
federal parliament in partnership with the Czech republic's left-wing
parties. Right-wing politicians have warned in Prague that his victory could
herald the end of a workable federal parliament.
Mr Meciar's calls for increased state subsidies for ailing enterprises has
won the support of the Democratic Left Party, the renamed communist party,
which, while allegedly pro-federation, is calling for greater state
intervention in the transition to a free market. Led by a charismatic and
relatively young man, Mr Petr Weiss, it gets about 12 per cent in the polls.
His party is also supported by smaller, but equally nationalist parties, in
Slovakia, such as the Slovak National Party, the only party to call openly
for independence. It has an estimated 10 per cent support in the Slovak
population.
Careful to avoid the word 'independence,' Mr Meciar talks about 'increased
autonomy.' Polls show that only a small minority wants outright
independence. Still, the rhetoric is unambiguous: 'If we want to be the
equal of other countries in Europe,' he told his Banska Stvianica rally, 'we
have to join it as separate state. Slovakia must have its own legal status
in Europe. We must be able to take decisions by ourselves and with our own
money.'
President Havel, after a recent meeting with Mr Meciar, warned of 'dangerous
ideas about the possibility of dissolving the common state from above and
constituting fully independent republics ..then tied in a vague dualist
union.' Speaking at the opening of his own electoral campaign, Mr Havel
stressed that this would lead 'to nothing but a chaotic break-up of the
state.'
Talks about dividing the two republics pervade the discourse of all
political parties in both the republics as voting-day approaches. Faced with
the possibility of an unworkable federal parliament, Czech right-wing
parties, which head the opinion polls in their republic, have signalled an
unwillingness to compromise.
'I do not rule out the possibility of two countries emerging,' Mr Meciar
told the crowd, 'but it will be because the Czechs were unable to co-operate
with us.' The crowd applauds, seeming to have forgotten entirely that it was
his own party that opposed all tentative agreements between the republics.

FT  02 JUN 92 / Chaos obscures casualties of Serbian sanctions:
Energy-dependent industry and tobacco exports are likely to be quickly
affected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRACTORS for Algeria and construction contracts in Russia will be casualties
of UN trade sanctions against Serbia and Montenegro which came into force
yesterday.
Inside Serbia, mile-long lines of cars formed in front of petrol stations as
motorists reacted to fears of early fuel shortages. But there was no
panic-buying in Belgrade's still well-stocked supermarkets and grocery
stores. Most people appeared confident that the sanctions would not make
much difference to food supplies.
Initial assessments of the impact of the ban, which covers all trade, an oil
embargo and the cutting of air links, have been confused:
Trade with Serbia and Montenegro has been badly disrupted since August last
year, when violence first flared between Serbia and Croatia.
Serbia's second most important market (after Germany) was the former Soviet
Union, where trade has in any case been disrupted by a shortage of foreign
exchange and upheavals in central Europe.
Serbia has had many months to anticipate the ban, perhaps stockpiling
critical imports like oil and gas. It is unclear how easily countries might
circumvent the ban - say by exporting to Macedonia, and freighting goods
overland into Serbia from there.
Trade statistics are a mess, since no Yugoslavia-wide data have been
compiled since August. Also purchases between the six republics have been
transformed from internal to foreign trade. According to the Economist
Intelligence Unit, about 40 per cent of Serbia's GNP is accounted for by
trade with Croatia and Slovenia. It is arguable that the decimation of this
trade is as damaging to Serbia as foreign sanctions.
An early casualty inside Serbia will be Yugocars and other vehicles made at
the Crvena Zastava enterprise in Belgrade.
Various components and upholstery, traditionally supplied from Slovenia and
Croatia, have already been disrupted by military conflict. Efforts to find
new sources inside Serbia have met with only partial success.
Important export markets, like Greece where Yugocars enjoyed preferential
tariff access, will now be lost. A Dollars 50m (Pounds 27.7m) contract to
sell tractors to Algeria, where Crvena Zastava first entered the market a
decade ago, will also be frozen.
Yugoslavia's textiles and clothing industry has already been disrupted. In
1990, it accounted for almost Dollars 1bn of Yugoslavia's exports. In
Germany, an important market for Serbian textile products, the effect of
sanctions would be 'certainly painful' for some sectors and some individual
companies, the Gesamttextil industry group said.
Among its main farm exports, tobacco will be badly hit. One of Serbia's main
tobacco enterprises, Duvanska Industrija, was planning to build a Dollars
110m facility to be supplied by Komas of Italy - a deal which must be in
abeyance.
All energy-dependent industry is likely to be quickly affected - including
chemicals and iron and steel. Mr Mirolem Dzindo, manager of a fertiliser
factory, said: 'We used to get get gas from Russia. Our whole production
will stop. The state will not have enough artificial fertiliser. That means
that there will be no food. There will be hunger . . . '
Serbia depends on imports for about 40 per cent of its energy, and is no
longer able to import oil and gas through the Adriatic pipeline. Almost a
quarter of Serbia's oil came last year from China, with a similar amount
from Russia, while Iran supplied 16 per cent and Romania a further 13 per
cent.
China was among the most reluctant to impose sanctions on Serbia, but is
thought likely to abide by the UN directive, if only because delivery to
Serbia is so difficult. Russia's response will be pivotal. Progres, the
Belgrade-based foreign trade company, recently announced a Dollars 3.5bn
agreement under which Russia would supply energy and raw materials in
exchange for Serbian farm and consumer products, and construction work.
Mr Vyacheslav Dmitriev, deputy director of the trade department of the
Russian Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations said last night that
negotiations between Russia and Serbia on trade contracts would continue, in
spite of Russia's announced intention to apply embargoes against the
Yugoslav republic.
He regarded an embargo as temporary and had received no instructions to
break off negotiations.
However, he said there had been very few recent trade contracts with Serbia
because of lack of hard currency on both sides.
The CIS countries were Serbia's second most important trading partner,
behind Germany, and ahead of Italy and France. The impact of sanctions on
trading partners will vary more in terms of their geographic location than
in terms of the importance to them of the Serbian market in its own right.
For example, despite Germany's importance to the former Yugoslavia as a
trading partner, its annual imports of Dollars 1.1bn and exports of Dollars
1.9bn in 1990 accounted for less than one per cent of all German foreign
trade. Serbia traditionally accounts for around a quarter of total
Yugoslav-German trade.
The direct effects of the war and measures taken by government and
individual companies had anyway sharply reduced German trade with Yugoslavia
even before UN sanctions were imposed.
Italy accounted for 14 per cent of the former Yugoslavia's total foreign
trade. However, almost 60 per cent of this was accounted for by the two
republics of Croatia and Slovenia with which Italy has long held close ties.
Indeed, the independence of these two republics has accelerated Italian
trade, mainly made up of food products and light industrial goods.
By contrast, Hungary will be more affected than most by sanctions.
Hungarians are particularly worried that Serbia will respond to Hungarian
sanctions by blocking river traffic down the Danube, Hungary's only waterway
route to the open sea.
Hungary is the mainland transit route for Serbian trade since conflict made
transporting goods through Yugoslavia difficult. Truck and rail traffic
continues as normal at present, pending a government decision later this
week.
Greece and Turkey are similarly compromised, since Serbia sits across their
main land bridge to the EC market. Goods travelling to Europe could easily
be 'diverted' in Serbia, local observers claim.

<TEXT>
GERMANY'S aerospace industry has made serious tactical blunders in its
campaign to participate in building the European fighter aircraft (EFA), and
now has virtually no chance of winning a majority for the project in the
Bundestag, according to a leading parliamentary defence spokesman.
Dr Werner Hoyer, the defence expert for the Free Democrats (FDP) in the
Bundestag, warned that the issue would be decided on an emotional, not a
factual basis. He is one of the six-man working group which met last night
to recommend the degree of Germany's future participation in the project.
In an interview shortly beforehand, he said there was no hope of putting
together a parliamentary majority in favour of allocating more funds to the
EFA project next year in the current climate of budget cuts.
The deep disagreements about the aircraft within the governing German
coalition were made clear yesterday when two leading politicians differed
fundamentally over what should be done.
Mr Erich Riedl, a member of the Bavaria-based Christian Social Union (CSU)
and state secretary in the Economics Ministry, said tens of thousands of
jobs in the German aerospace industry would be lost if Germany pulled out of
the project. 'Every politician thinks he will win elections at home if he is
against the EFA,' he said in a radio interview. 'But it is wrong, even
irresponsible, to think like that.'
The opposite viewpoint was put by Mr Peter Hintze, newly appointed as
secretary-general of Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democrats (CDU). He
said the EFA was not appropriate 'in the changed financial and security
situation in a united Germany'.
The CSU has succeeded in having a decision on the project deferred, with
tomorrow's joint meeting of the CDU/CSU parliamentary group postponed to
June 16.
Dr Hoyer believes that in spite of the delay, the fate of German
participation is sealed. 'The decisive point in our report is whether the
working group recommends, or whether the defence minister recommends,
allocating some DM100m (Pounds 34m) in the 1993 budget for pre-production
costs (for EFA), to purchase the tools needed for later construction,' Dr
Hoyer said. 'The industry insists these tools will be needed.
'The decision to put this into the budget will be seen as a point of no
return. But there is no majority in the Bundestag in favour.
'It is a catastrophic mistake by the German (aerospace) industry to have
insisted on this. They thought they could get a positive decision now.'
Dr Hoyer said that no alternative aircraft should be automatically excluded.
They include the US F-16 and F-18, the Swedish Gripen, and the Russian
MiG-29. However, he said he would not vote for any solution which would be
more expensive than the EFA.
The German aerospace industry, led by Daimler-Benz, argues that any
alternative would be more expensive than the EFA, because the input of
German industry, and the taxes repaid to the government, would be far lower
with an imported aircraft.

HUNDREDS of travellers were stranded at Belgrade airport yesterday, and
thousands more delayed abroad, as UN sanctions on air travel took effect,
Reuter reports from Belgrade.
By midday, 18 flights from Belgrade had been cancelled. Only one aircraft
had left  - to Moscow. The airport was packed with people, screaming babies
and armed police.
The UN barred all aircraft from leaving Yugoslavia, except in special
circumstances.
Tanjug news agency said Germany, Switzerland and the Netherlands had already
enforced the ban.
An official in Belgrade said some aircraft might take off, but could be
turned back in mid-flight.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Justinian: A trespasser in the skies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LOUIS BLOM-COOPER QC
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If a helicopter hovers over X's house for five to 10 minutes in order to
take photographs for the purpose of publishing them in a national newspaper,
what remedy (if any) does X have against the newspaper and the photographer?
That question might currently, or in the recent past, be found in an
examination paper for budding lawyers or journalists. It provides one of the
quiddities of media law, which continues to intrigue students of the
invasion of privacy.
The problem was given an airing last week in an adjudication from the Press
Complaints Commission. It rejected a complaint against the Daily Mail, which
had published a story with photographs (obtained aerially from a helicopter)
of the home of Mr David Sullivan, the publisher of Sunday Sport. The
newspaper was held not to have invaded Mr Sullivan's privacy and, in any
event, the newspaper was entitled to defend itself on the ground that its
story was a matter of public interest.
In acquitting the newspaper, did the commission have one eye firmly on a
recommendation made by Lord Calcutt's committee two years ago which so far
has not found favour with either government or parliament? The Calcutt
committee, in rejecting the idea of providing a civil law remedy for the
invasion of privacy, was keen nevertheless to see some remedy introduced
into the criminal law in order to deter the worst journalistic excesses
involving physical intrusion into people's lives.
The committee identified three situations: the physical entry into private
property for the purpose of obtaining personal information for publication;
the placing of bugging devices on private property for that purpose; and the
photographing of individuals or the recording of their voices on private
property for that purpose - in each case without the individual's consent. A
defence to the proposed offence of criminal trespass would be that the act
was carried out to prevent, detect or expose the commission of any crime or
other seriously antisocial conduct, or for the protection of public health
or safety or 'under any lawful authority'.
The committee rejected the idea of making it a further offence to publish
any photograph, information or recording obtained by illegal methods. It was
circumspect about creating an offence of publishing material where the point
at issue would be how it was obtained, rather than the content. The
proprietor or editor could always be prosecuted as an accessory to the
proposed offences, or for conspiracy.
The essence of the proposed criminal offences is the motive of the
'trespasser'. Fifteen years ago, Lord Bernstein, the founder of the Granada
entertainment group, brought an action in the high court against a company
engaged in the business of taking aerial photographs of properties, without
the owners' consent, and then offering the product to the owners for sale. A
single photograph taken by a helicopter which flew over Lord Bernstein's
country estate was offered, and contemptuously turned down, at a price of
Pounds 15.
The trial judge dismissed the action for trespass on the ground that Lord
Bernstein did not own the air space over his land. As Lord Wilberforce once
pronounced in a different legal context, to suggest that 'land' means the
whole of the space from the centre of the earth to the heavens was 'so
sweeping, unscientific and impractical a doctrine' that it would not appeal
to any legal, let alone a non-legal, mind.
But what about an invasion of privacy? The judge held that the mere taking
of a photograph was not unlawful. It was not possible, therefore, to
transform an act which was not a trespass into one, in the absence of a law
of privacy.
In Lord Bernstein's case, however, the photographing was distinctly not for
any journalistic purpose. The judge warned that he did not wish his judgment
to be understood as deciding that in no circumstances could a successful
action be brought against an aerial photographer to restrain his activities.
If an individual was subjected to the harassment of constant surveillance of
his house from the air, accompanied by photographing of his every activity,
the court might regard that as an unwarranted invasion of privacy and an
actionable nuisance for which the court would give relief. But the single
act of photography, restricted to one short period, would be unlikely to
arouse the ire of the law to the point of classifying it as a nuisance.
Hence the Calcutt committee's desire to fill the gap, by creating three
offences of criminal trespass exclusively where a journalistic purpose was
being effected.
The route that legislators might take, in the light of the Press Complaints
Commission adjudication, is to provide a civil remedy, rather than
contemplate the risk of putting a journalist or an editor in the dock.
Aerial surveillance is more susceptible to abuse and invasion of privacy
than ground surveillance. And helicopters, with their virtually unlimited
manoeuvrability, are particularly likely to intrude unreasonably upon
private activities. Perhaps a single amendment to section 76 of the Civil
Aviation Act 1982 (dealing with the liability of aircraft for trespass,
nuisance and surface damage) would suffice.

FT  01 JUN 92 / International Bonds: Top Danish bank launches Dollars 100m
subordinated FRNs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEN DANSKE BANK, Denmark's biggest bank, has launched an international
offering of subordinated floating-rate notes.
The Dollars 100m, eight-year issue is intended to count as upper tier 2
capital. It marks the first time a Danish bank has launched such notes in
the international market since the implementation of the EC Own Funds and
Solvency Directives in 1990.
Under the Basle Accord on capital adequacy, banks must maintain a minimum
capital-to-assets ratio of 8 per cent.
Half of the total capital must be tier 1 (or core capital), consisting of
common equity and perpetual preference shares, and the remainder can be tier
2 (or non-core capital), including dated preference shares, subordinated
loans and hybrid debt instruments.
Den Danske Bank's Dollars 100m issue has a coupon of Libor plus 110 basis
points during the first five years. Den Danske Bank has the right to redeem
the notes at par after five years; however if the bank does not call in the
notes it will pay a coupon of Libor plus 250 basis points.
It has a long-term senior debt rating of Aa2 from Moody's Investors Service,
and A-plus from Standard &amp; Poor's.
Salomon Brothers said the issue was sold to traditional floating-rate note
investors.

FT  01 JUN 92 / International Capital Markets: Being beastly to the bankers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government has won no friends in the City over the Canary Wharf affair.
It is accused of dithering over moving civil servants eastwards,
short-sightedness over the Jubilee line, and in general of being beastly to
the banks.
Yet the government has surely done the right thing by its own free-market
principles. It has bailed nobody out, it will get its new offices cheaper,
and some future landowner will surely regard a large contribution to the
tube line as a prudent investment in value enhancement. Above all, there is
a good deal to be said for being beastly to the banks at a time like this,
not only to save money, but as a form of education.
The case is made in a new paper from the US National Bureau of Economic
Research. Paul Asquith, Robert Gertner and David Scharfstein studied* 102
companies which issued junk bonds and then got into cash-flow trouble
(mainly, it seems, not because they could not afford the payments they had
undertaken, but because the burden distracted their managements, and made
them less competitive). Some of them survived, but in no case because their
banks helped. On the contrary, banks seem positively to have preferred
bankruptcy, because there were unsecured lenders to absorb any losses.
Now it is true that the US is not Britain. Bankruptcy is not so final:
Chapter 11 allows an orderly debt work-out where this is possible and not
just, as here, when the creditors are optimistic - or, more likely, trying
to postpone the evil day. There is a far larger number of banks, so lenders
are less likely to find that a ruthless approach to one defaulter pushes
other and otherwise sound borrowers over the edge.
All the same, it would be surprising if British banks were to prove much
more accommodating if a similar study were made here. It is nearly always a
bank, with collateral, that pulls the plug. That is why so many of us, and
not just recent bankrupts, feel a certain schadenfreude when we see banks
join their borrowers in trouble because, as at Canary Wharf, the collateral
proves largely illusory. That may teach them.
In the NBER study it was those companies which still had some assets they
were free to sell which were likeliest to survive. In the UK, where
companies have fewer alternatives to bank credit (and small companies none),
the assets are all hocked; hence the business failures which follow any
epidemic of banking folly. In the world of property development, this
'system' has its merits: nothing so quickly restores sane values as a wave
of receivers' sales. But it would still be much better to prevent values
being bid up to insane levels in the first place; and in the world of
operating companies which produce goods and services, the process is
disruptive and wasteful.
Can bankers be made wise? Probably not, but at least they can be kept
cautious. The most effective way would be my own (largely friendless)
proposal to outlaw collateral, by enacting that banks would rank with all
other creditors in a bankruptcy (a one-clause Bill would do it). This would
force banks into relationship banking, rather than simply paying lip service
to it in hard times. Attention to cash-flow and management competence
prevents nasty surprises - a sound practice which enabled some small banks
to survive the holocausts in New England and Texas.
Failing a change in the rules, the best the government can do is prolong the
agony, and so ensure that it is more than 17 years before folly breaks out
again. It could also give a useful signal when it appoints a new governor to
the Bank of England this year.
It should appoint none of those who were in authority during the Big Bang
and the subsequent follies. However sage their private warnings may have
been at the time, they are publicly identified with what happened on their
watch. Much better a new banker like Lord Alexander, whose whole experience
is of clearing up the mess; or, perhaps, a veteran like Sir David Scholey,
who passed the 'If' test, and kept his head.

FT  01 JUN 92 / US Money and Credit: Economic data point to modest growth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS a week which began with inflation jitters, yet ended with a bond
market rally. What came in between was a series of economic indicators,
generally confirming a 'modest growth' scenario.
The inflationary worries owed more to external events than domestic matters.
Reports of Saudi Arabia's change in oil pricing policy sent crude prices
higher and the bond market into hasty decline. Its retreat was then aided by
two relatively buoyant sets of statistics: the monthly Conference Board
survey showed that consumer confidence improved significantly in May, the
third straight month that progress had been seen, while car sales also
showed some incipient recovery.
So down went the benchmark 30-year long bond, and prices of other
fixed-income securities, at both the short and long end of the market,
followed suit. The long bond fell by  17/32 to 100 7/8 , on Monday, with the
yield rising from 7.82 per cent to 7.91.
However matters were not destined to stay this way. Twenty-four hours later,
bond investors shrugged off a mixed durable goods report, and by Wednesday
they were rapidly reassessing the size of the potential oil price rise.
As Bear Sterns noted: 'While it is true that the price of oil has increased
from a low of Dollars 18 in February to the current price of Dollars 22, it
is still 8 per cent below the previous near-term peak of Dollars 24 in
November 1991.'
Relatively tight monetary policy, its analysts argue, should limit the
future inflationary risk, while longer-term supply-demand factors also argue
against a sustained rise in oil prices.
A day later, the bond market was focusing on some weak money supply figures
 -showing that all three of the most closely tracked money supply measures
fell during the week ending May 18 - and largely ignoring a fairly
pronounced drop in weekly unemployment claims.
This was not entirely quixotic. When the Federal Reserve last eased monetary
policy in April, it cited weak money supply growth as a reason. Although
some analysts have been sceptical, wondering whether this was really the
underlying reason, the bond market has paid increased attention to the money
supply numbers ever since.
On Friday, there was then the cheering sight of a revised first-quarter
gross domestic product number, which showed the economy performing only
slightly better than originally suggested. This was in contrast to a
previous prediction, by the chairman of the President's Council of Economic
Advisers, that the revised figures would be 'substantially' higher than
first estimates.
And, just to round off the market's feeling of relief, the Chicago
purchasing managers' survey showed a modest upturn in the manufacturing
sector last month, but with the employment component of the index falling
from April levels. So, on that relaxed note, the long bond ended the week
with another  9/32 gain, at 101 15/32 , to yield 7.83 per cent.
Now all eyes are on the May employment report, due out on Friday. If this is
truely grim, some pundits suggest that room still exists for a further
easing.
However, most observers doubt the statistics will be decisive. Donaldson,
Lufkin &amp; Jenrette, for example, estimates that non-farm payroll employment
rose by 110,000 workers in May - slightly less than the 126,000 increase in
April. It predicts that the unemployment rate overall should have eased
modestly, from 7.2 per cent two months ago, to 7.1 per cent in May.

FT  01 JUN 92 / International Company News: Ferruzzi down sharply as debt
expenses climb
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
FERRUZZI Finanziaria (Ferfin), the holding company for Italy's second
biggest private-sector industrial group, suffered a sharp drop in net
attributable profits, to L115bn (Dollars 93.8m) for 1991, against L248bn the
previous year.
The decline, on the back of a 6.3 per cent rise in sales to L17,790bn, stems
from a mixture of heavy debt costs, ambitious investments, and the
non-recurrance of the extraordinary items which enhanced earnings in 1990.
Ferfin reaped substantial capital gains in 1990, principally from the sale
by its Montedison subsidiary of its 40 per cent stake in the public-private
Enimont chemicals joint venture. Asset sales in 1991 were more limited,
despite the group's goal of concentrating on core sectors.
Gross operating profits rose 11.2 per cent to L1,962bn, despite lower
margins for polymers, owing to lower demand from big industrial users. The
group balance sheet weakened further, with a rise in net debt to L8,198bn
from L6,665bn in 1990 and a debt equity ratio down to 0.88 from 0.76.
Investment spending remained high at L1,156bn, although a small fall from
L1,397bn in 1990 reflected the gradual completion of a heavy spending phase.
The dividend will remain at L45 for ordinary shares, and L75 for savings
stock.
Ferfin made a characteristically upbeat forecast for the current year. Sales
in the first quarter rose 5 per cent to L4,420bn, while the gross operating
margin rose 7.5 per cent. The Parisian banker, Mr Jean-Marc Vernes, 69, has
announced he will retire at the end of the year as chairman of Beghin-Say,
the French sugar group controlled by Ferruzzi, writes Will Dawkins from
Paris. Mr Vernes helped engineer the merger of two French sugar groups to
form Beghin-Say in 1972.

FINMECCANICA, the company controlling the engineering and aerospace
activities of Italy's state-owned IRI group, has moved closer to flotation,
writes Haig Simonian. It now has approval for its merger with SIFA, a quoted
holding company owned by IRI.
Under the transaction, which involves a two-stage capital increase and a
bond issue, Finmeccanica should raise around L2,400bn (Dollars 1.9bn) and be
quoted by November.
Shareholders in SIFA will be offered 9 shares in Finmeccanica for every 4
shares held, based on evaluation by Lehman Brothers, the US investment bank.
The deal is part of Italy's partial privatisation programme.

AP-DJ reports from Canberra.
Prime Minister Mr Paul Keating said in a television interview yesterday that
the proposal would be considered by the cabinet today and tomorrow. He added
that the government might sell 70 per cent of the merged airline in an
initial public offering, with international airlines allowed to acquire
holdings.
The government previously announced plans to sell all of Australian Airlines
and 49 per cent of Qantas.

INTEGRO, the European arm of a group of investors which controls Investec
Bank of South Africa, has acquired a small Dutch stockbroking firm, Th.
Wouters en Zoon. The deal marks its second acquisition in the Netherlands'
financial community since the late 1980s.
Wouters, which has a staff of five, is to be integrated next year with
Heerze, another small Amsterdam stockbroking firm acquired by Integro in
1989. Terms of the latest deal were not disclosed.
The two stockbroking firms will retain their separate identities for the
rest of 1992, before being integrated in 1993.
Integro's next priority for European expansion is Frankfurt, where it is
particularly interested in the options and futures markets, according to Mr
Ian Kantor, Integro's chief executive director and single biggest
shareholder, with 25 per cent of the group's shares.
Integro has offices in Geneva, Zurich and London.

FT  01 JUN 92 / RBC may lose up to CDollars 300m on O&amp;Y loans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<TEXT>
ROYAL Bank of Canada has added CDollars 300m (Pounds 138m) to its loan-loss
provisions to cover expected losses on the O&amp;Y portfolio and some other
problem accounts. However, this write-down has been offset by an equal
reduction in provisions for Third World loans, thus containing the fall in
second-quarter earnings to 8 per cent.
RBC, Canada's biggest financial institution, said it has classified
two-thirds of its CDollars 780m exposure to O&amp;Y as non-performing, resulting
in a 45 per cent jump in non-accrual loans over the past year to CDollars
2.7bn. It still expects its net loan losses for the year to be CDollars
740m. The net second-quarter provision was CDollars 185m, up from CDollars
155m a year earlier.
Earnings slipped to CDollars 212.3m, or 59 cents a share, in the three
months to April 30, from CDollars 230m, or 69 cents a share, a year earlier.
Net interest income edged up to just over CDollars 1bn from CDollars 977m.
Canada's six big banks have disclosed a total exposure to O&amp;Y of CDollars
3.1bn. Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, the ailing developer's biggest
creditor, has taken a special charge of CDollars 1bn. Bank of Montreal,
which says its loans to O&amp;Y are secured, has left its estimate of loan
losses unchanged for fiscal 1992. Like RBC, Bank of Nova Scotia cushioned
the O&amp;Y blow, using Third World writedowns.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Chambers of trade and commerce set to agree on merger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S chambers of commerce and chambers of trade are on the verge of
ending their long rivalry and hope to reach agreement on a merger by the
autumn.
A link-up between the Association of British Chambers of Commerce (ABCC),
with 83,000 member companies, and the National Chamber of Trade (NCT), with
150,000 members, mainly in retailing, would create a business organisation
second in size only to the Confederation of British Industry with 250,000
members.
A merger would also bolster the ABCC's programme to reorganise and
strengthen the chamber of commerce network to make it more of a match for
the large officially recognised chambers on the Continent. The ABCC has
launched a recruitment drive to bring membership to 150,000 by 1994 as part
of the programme.
'A merger will complicate our development strategy but it will add new
fabric and build membership,' said Ms Janet Poshtar, spokeswoman for the
ABCC.
The chambers of commerce and of trade have made many attempts in recent
years to merge but these failed over disagreements about the respective
voting strengths of the two organisations. These problems have been overcome
with agreement for the NCT to form a retail division of the ABCC.
Last month's annual meeting of the NCT voted by a margin of nine to one in
favour of a merger in principle. The ABCC board of management and national
council have now approved the merger and the NCT will consult members in
more detail before the two organisations hold extraordinary meetings in the
autumn to finalise the merger.
'On a move as fundamental as this we have to give all our members an
opportunity to comment,' said Mr Bernard Tennant, director general of the
NCT. 'It (the proposed merger) is a terrific achievement.'
The organisations believe that combining their head offices - the ABCC's in
London and the NCT's in Reading - will make considerable savings.
The largest remaining question concerns the degree to which local chambers
of trade and chambers of commerce work together. Neither central
organisation can force individual member chambers to work with other groups
but the benefits of the merger would otherwise be lost. The NCT told members
recently that local autonomy was 'sacrosanct' and would remain so even after
a merger.
The two organisations have been rivals for much of this century although the
chambers of trade have tended to attract the small retailer while the
chambers of commerce have drawn their membership from a broader range of
manufacturing and service industries.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Ten arrests at unveiling of 'Bomber' Harris statue
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE arrested 10 protesters yesterday at the dedication ceremony in
central London of a statue of Sir Arthur 'Bomber' Harris, the RAF chief
responsible for the blanket bombing campaign over German cities in the
Second World War.
The arrests followed the unveiling of the statue by the Queen Mother, who
was interrupted and heckled during a speech honouring Sir Arthur and the
55,000 allied Bomber Command aircrew killed in action.
Scuffles broke out as protesters standing in a crowd of wartime veterans
shouted 'Harris was a mass murderer'.
The Queen Mother said that Sir Arthur was 'an inspiring leader' and that the
bombing crews had 'given us hope and the means of salvation' during the war.
The ceremony sparked protests in several German cities and was condemned by
civic leaders in some towns hit by RAF bombers. The German foreign ministry
and the mayors of Dresden, Cologne and Pforzheim protested at the memorial.
The Queen Mother, patron of the Bomber Command Association which paid for
the statue, performed the ceremony at St Clement Danes Church in the Strand.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Binding the moral and political wounds: Italy's new
president will seek urgent action
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The cartoonists have lost no time in poking fun at Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro,
Italy's new president, picking on his publicly professed Catholic faith and
his authoritarian manner. The 73-year-old head of state was being depicted
as an Ayatollah within 24 hours of his inauguration last week.
The humour of the cartoonists has brought into sharp relief the personality
of the new president, and the mood of Italy. The country is crying out for
leadership - both political and moral. Mr Scalfaro, within the limits of his
presidential power, wants to provide it.
The political parties wasted the whole of 1991 rehearsing for general
elections, which in the end were held this April. A large protest vote
further fragmented the political parties and rendered unworkable an already
discredited system of coalition government.
The difficulties of forming a new government risk leaving Italy rudderless -
precisely when decisions are most needed. The deteriorating state of the
country's public finances demands urgent and unpopular corrective measures.
Otherwise, as Mr Carlo Azeglio Ciampi, governor of the Bank of Italy,
pointed out at the weekend, Italy's economy will never meet the minimum
requirements for convergence with its main European Community partners.
In the past three months, a moral dimension has also emerged on two fronts.
Continuous revelations in the municipal corruption scandal in Milan have
angered a nation seemingly immune to tales of pork-barrel politics.
Magistrates are uncovering a sophisticated carve-up of commissions on public
contracts among all the main political parties, including the self-professed
'clean' former-Communist party of the democratic left (PDS).
Mr Scalfaro partly owes his compromise candidature for the presidency to his
being seen as a figure untainted by corruption.
The second front is organised crime. The brutal Mafia assassination of Mr
Giovanni Falcone, Italy's leading anti-Mafia magistrate, nine days ago, was
a direct challenge to the state. It was not just the manner of the killing -
blowing up his three-car convoy near Palermo with a ton of explosives. Mr
Falcone was the most heavily guarded official, and symbolised the fight
against organised crime, which is more powerful today than at any time since
the Second World War. At least part of the explanation for the Mafia's
survival is seen in the way politicians have been willing to use organised
crime and vice versa, to their mutual benefit.
Against this bleak backdrop, Mr Scalfaro could prove the benign Ayatollah
and promote change. On his inauguration, he took the unprecedented step of
'inviting' parliament to form a commission to study proposals for an urgent
overhaul of the constitution. He also told the military a large parade in
Rome next weekend was inappropriate. The parade has been cancelled, even
though the review stands were already erected.
This week may provide further clues to how Mr Scalfaro sees his role, when
he begins consultations to form a new government. Traditionally, the head of
state's right to invite someone to form a government has been treated as a
formality. The real power has lain with the parliamentary parties, who have
put the president in his job anyway.
However, this does not preclude the president from knocking heads together
or acting as an arbiter. Mr Scalfaro's long parliamentary experience,
combined with his credentials as an independent- minded Christian Democrat,
backed by the second largest party, the PDS, permit him the role of referee
 -especially when the parties are so weak.
Before the general elections, the main political parties believed the next
government would be formed by a continuation of the Christian
Democrat-Socialist alliance, which had kept the Communists at bay for years.
These two parties, with their minor allies, the Liberals and Social
Democrats, planned to continue their carve-up of power, with Mr Bettino
Craxi, the Socialist leader, as prime minister, and probably Mr Giulio
Andreotti, the outgoing premier, being rewarded with the presidency.
The poor showing of the Christian Democrats and the Socialists in the
elections ended the prospect of the outgoing four-party coalition forming
the next government. Although the coalition retains a narrow majority in
parliament, it lacks the credibility to govern on its own, and its leaders'
reputations have been damaged by the failure to read the public demand for
reform.
The Christian Democrats are in disarray after the April elections -
highlighted by the inability of the party to rally to support Mr Arnaldo
Forlani, the party's secretary, as the preferred presidential candidate. His
resignation, after failing to gain sufficient backing for his presidential
bid, hastens a generational change, and strains to the limit the party's
capacity to juggle with at least seven different factions.
The Socialists have been gravely damaged for their perceived involvement as
the principal actors in the Milan corruption scandal. Milan magistrates
allege that, at the highest level in the municipality, there was an
arrangement whereby bids for big construction contracts were rigged and then
commissions were handed out on the basis of the quota of votes each party
gathered in the elections. The split went allegedly 27 per cent to the
Socialists, 20 per cent each to the Christian Democrats and the PDS, and the
remainder to the smaller parties.
The scandal has played into the hands of the populist Lombard League, the
electoral platform of which was directed against corrupt party politics.
But, more generally, the prestige of the parties has been weakened and they
are seen as the prime culprits for encouraging an abuse of political
patronage which, in turn, has weighed on the size of the huge public sector
deficit. To be credible, the next government has to take account of this
deep public unease over the perversion of the current political system,
whereby state and party interests have become intertwined. But the pressure
for change is coming most directly from Brussels. The EC has been issuing
increasingly impatient diktats to bring the economy into line with the
Maastricht summit's terms.
On the central criteria of inflation levels, interest rates, debt and public
sector deficit, the Italian performance is increasingly distant from that of
its main EC partners. The public sector deficit is more than 10.5 per cent
of gross domestic product, debt is close to 105 per cent of GDP, and retail
price inflation is an annual 5.8 per cent. The 1992 budget is so overspent
and underfunded that the EC has proposed the rapid introduction of an
austerity package. The budget is heading for a deficit of at least
L165,000bn (Pounds 74.5bn) instead of the L128,000bn agreed with the EC.
The politicians no longer have the excuse of an electoral timetable to duck
action. The plight of the economy could well dictate the formation of a
'technical' government, with the limited task of economic stabilisation and
introducing political reforms to alter the unworkable system of proportional
representation. President Scalfaro is likely to stake his reputation on
persuading the politicians to agree as soon as possible.

Which of the following boardroom moves is the more important for Britain's
depressed property market?
Last week Li Ka-Shing resigned from HSBC Holdings, parent of the Hongkong
Bank, and this week David Li, a somewhat younger member of the colony's
movers and shakers club, steps on to the board of Chelsfield, Elliott
Bernerd's privately-owned property company. Both men are wealthy, interested
in property, and have strong British ties.
David Li, the 51-year-old chief executive of Hong Kong's Bank of East Asia,
and 47-year-old Bernerd go back a long way. Bernerd attended Li's 50th
birthday party and Li bought a bit of Bernerd's Wentworth golf course and
his bank co-managed a private placement of Chelsfield's shares.
If Bernerd is to stand a chance of making a decent stock market debut later
this year - and his PR machine seems to be in top gear - he needs more
independent names than just Li's on his letterhead. The sight of a wealthy
banker going on to the board of a company that his bank does business with,
is not always the best buy signal. The potential conflicts of interest have
to be set against the value of the business connections.
By contrast, now that Li Ka-Shing has severed his ties with the Hong Kong
Bank, he is far less restricted in what he can do especially when it
involves the bank's troubled property clients.

Expatriates working for distant multinationals might do well to check which
living-cost survey head office uses in setting their pay.
A check on one such survey, just published by the Geneva-based Corporate
Resources Group, shows some marked differences from similar studies done by
other organisations. Take for instance the CRG cost indices as compared with
those produced by the P-E International consultancy by averaging the
findings of surveys done by the United Nations, the US government and other
official bodies.
Admittedly, the two sets of results - neither of which takes account of
housing costs - are largely agreed about other expenses in Japan. Taking
London as a base-line, CRG puts Tokyo at 46 per cent higher as against P-E's
43.
But elsewhere, they are at odds. For example P-E rates Geneva at 10 per cent
more costly than London whereas CRG rates it the same. Paris is marked at 2
per cent higher by P-E and 5 per cent lower by CRG. Both rate New York
lower, but CRG by 16 per cent and P-E by only 8 per cent.
Would globe-trotting readers care to advise Observer which of the estimates,
if either, reflects reality?

FT  01 JUN 92 / Observer: Durlacher's turn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
No prizes for predicting who will succeed David Burton as chairman of Liffe.
Nick Durlacher, chairman of BZW Futures and Liffe's deputy chairman since
1988, would be entitled to feel miffed if he didn't get the job tomorrow.
Burton, Liffe's longest-serving chairman, has presided over a period which
has seen average daily volume surge from 61,000 lots in 1988, to over  1/4 m
today. A soft-spoken Lancastrian with a passion for antique glass, it was
hard at first to see how he could match his flamboyant predecessor, Brian
Williamson (now chairman of Gerrard &amp; National). But the former chief dealer
at Bank of America has done equally well.
Given the combination of the family name and the backing of Barclays, it
might seem that Durlacher is getting the Liffe chairmanship, rather than
Jack Wigglesworth, for example, just because it's his turn. Not so, say his
fans pointing to his hard work in areas such as compliance.
Even so, when Liffe chief executive Michael Jenkins retires later this year
 -after an accomplished decade at the top - it is important that he is
replaced from outside. Futures are an arcane but by no means impenetrable
subject - a head for deltas and stop-losses is not really such a rare
commodity as the combination of management and marketing skill needed if
Liffe is to enjoy an equally prosperous second decade.

Although she'd probably prefer not to know it, Margaret Thatcher now stands
on a par with Karl Marx. Or so say the Russians lately polled by their
country's Centre for the Study of Public Opinion.
Mind you, neither of the two ranks very high in the Russians' list of the
world's greatest figures. They tie for 15th place in a league still headed
by Lenin even though the proportion of people nominating him is down from 67
per cent last year to only 43. The only foreigner in the top 10 is Albert
Einstein.
The Centre's sociologist Leonid Sedov says most indicators show worsening
chauvinistic attitudes among the various ethnic groups in the former Soviet
Union.
The Russians' greatest dislike is for the peoples of the Caucasus; then come
Jews and Chechens; followed by Central Asians, the Baltic peoples and
finally the Ukrainians and Belorussians.
The attitudes of other groups to the Russians vary widely. Whereas Central
Asians think them cultured and clever, for instance, the Baltic peoples
regard them as the opposite.
In Sedov's view, while the feared force of Russian nationalism is growing,
it is still relatively mild. External onlookers, however, may have qualms
about the rising popularity of Stalin. With a gain from 15 to 22 per cent
over the past year, he now stands third in the ranking.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Paying up for Maxwell victims
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN six months after Mr Robert Maxwell went missing from his yacht off
the Canary Islands, pension scheme members in his business empire are still
uncertain as to their future pension prospects. The government has shown
little inclination to do more than pass the buck. The official bodies of the
normally vociferous pensions lobby have maintained a studied silence. Banks
that backed Mr Maxwell on his breakneck expansion in the 1980s persist in
clinging, poker-faced, to stolen assets as security for their ill-judged
loans. The debate over compensation for present and future pensioners has
become bogged down in irrelevant detail.
This relegation of the pensioners' interests to a residual consideration in
the winding up of the Maxwell finances is altogether unseemly. For while Mr
Maxwell bears primary responsibility, the scandal is also the product of an
overwhelming failure of the British system of pension provision. So far the
government has offered the Maxwell pensioners no more than the equivalent of
the minimum pension under the state scheme. That is a derisory sum, which
reflects the failure of successive governments to establish an adequate
state pension plan in the 1960s and 1970s. If a third-best scheme was
adopted by the last Labour government, it was largely on the basis that
anything was better than continuing prevarication. Meantime the occupational
pensions sector flourished, faute de mieux, with the support of substantial
tax breaks.
More generous
A Maxwell-type scandal in Germany, France or even Italy would have been
inconceivable precisely because greater security is provided by more
generous state pension schemes. That is not to say that it is unreasonable
for any government to tilt the balance further in the direction of the
private sector. There may well be legitimate reasons, such as the impact of
demography on public finances, to do so. But if politicians choose to go
down that route, it is incumbent on them to provide a regulatory structure
to compensate for the increased risk that legitimate pension expectations
will be frustrated. This British politicians have conspicuously failed to
do.
The Wilson Committee, Professor Gower's review of investor protection, the
City Capital Markets Committee, numerous press commentators - all, over the
years, warned of the inadequacy of regulation and the need for legislation
to protect pension fund beneficiaries. The response of the Department of
Social Security and other interested Whitehall departments was supine. That
insouciant attitude was reflected in the 1986 Financial Services Act, which
confined itself purely to the narrower aspects of pensions investment
management. Pensioners were, in effect, excluded from the compensation
schemes set up under the new framework.
Collective responsibility
The regulatory debate now concentrates largely on the question of whether
the Department of Trade and Industry was right to grant a licence to London
and Bishopsgate International, the Maxwell fund management group, just
before the 1986 Act took effect and the extent to which the fund management
watchdog IMRO was at fault. These are important matters on which a
forthcoming report from the Securities and Investments Board will no doubt
throw light. But the real issue is Whitehall's collective responsibility for
failing to introduce adequate regulation in the first place.
The government is understandably worried about setting a precedent with the
Maxwell pensioners and other victims of theft or fraud. Yet a precedent has
already been set at Barlow Clowes. The case of the Maxwell pensioners is
invidious by comparison: most were coerced into their funds as a condition
of employment.
The government might reasonably twist the arms of the pensions lobby, many
of whose leaders opposed regulatory change, for a contribution via whatever
form of compensation scheme finally emerges. Conscience money should also be
extracted from the banks.
But it is for the government to take the initiative to make good the
estimated Pounds 400m loss. It should get off the fence and make a firm
commitment to compensate these victims of theft and fraud forthwith.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Leading Article: The road to Rio
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EARTH Summit, which gets under way in Rio on Wednesday, could hardly be
described as a happy event. The tortuous two-year preparations have exposed
a world far from united on the size and even the nature of the environmental
threat that faces it. Deep divisions have appeared between the rich and poor
countries over who should shoulder responsibility for the damage that has
been caused already and over what should be done to prevent more damage in
future.
Only a week ago, Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, the EC environment commissioner,
decided not to attend, denouncing the gathering as a cocktail party with a
pre-arranged outcome, a view which many undoubtedly share.
Such disenchantment is not altogether a bad thing. This cumbersome event,
with its 800 page agenda, was never likely to achieve anything of immediate
significance. Yet it was in danger of raising false hopes all around the
world - among those in the industrialised countries who saw it as the
trigger for global environmental action, and among those in developing
countries who were hoping for fresh flows of aid.
None of these hopes will be realised; that much is now clear. But this is no
reason for questioning the value of holding the summit at all; it means that
more realistic yardsticks are needed.
In one sense, Rio has already achieved some success merely by identifying
issues and drawing a large number of constituencies into the debate. We may
not have the answers, but the questions, at least, are clearer.
Natural resources
Have environmental pressures - for example pollution of the atmosphere and
the seas, or the pace of species extinction - advanced from being local
problems to matters of global concern? Is the rate at which we are using up
our natural resources unsustainable? Has the world's ecology entered a new
phase with man's ability to manipulate the environment? If the answer to any
of these questions is yes, or just probably, Rio can serve a purpose.
But three things are needed to prevent Rio from being merely a talking shop.
The first is rigorous control of the proceedings. Little will be gained if
the talks degenerate into finger-pointing or haggling over aid. To be
fruitful, this conference must stick to identifying environmental concerns
which are common to all participants, and initiating moves to deal with the
most urgent. There must also be realism, both about the dangers and the
action they call for.
Make sacrifices
Second is a willingness by all participants to make sacrifices. Most of the
world's environmental problems stem from excess. There must be a recognition
that the benefits of environmental protection come at a price. This is
obviously true for the industrial countries, but even developing countries
must play a part.
The third point is that Rio will initiate a process rather than conclude
one. It is essential that the politicians who put their names to the Rio
conventions be held to the commitments they make, however flimsy. This will
require the establishment of some kind of machinery to monitor progress and
bring pressure to bear on the laggards. An annual meeting of environmental
ministers is one suggestion.
A sense of proportion is essential. Much can still be done by ceasing to
pursue policies, such as energy subsidisation, that harm both the economy
and the environment. Where conflicts between the two may exist, there is
also much uncertainty. Yet it is nave to expect huge changes in social
behaviour on the basis of uncertain scientific forecasts for the distant
future. Rio could never have been more than a start.
This is not how idealists and environmental zealots see it. They have
already written off Rio. Others view it with a mixture of weariness and
dread. Doubtless there will be moments over the next 12 days when stalemate
and sheer verbiage will clog the mind. But Rio could create a watershed even
if this fact does not appear startlingly clear at the closing ceremony on
June 14. At one level it should initiate action to deal with specific
threats. But at another it should encourage the global consciousness, which
will be needed to ease the stresses on the planet's resources.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Countries don't go broke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The former chairman of Citibank, Walter Wriston, was much scoffed at for
saying: 'Countries cannot go broke.' So far as he was defending the massive
amounts of credit which the banks extended to Third World countries without
proper examination, I have no wish to come to his aid. Governments can and
do go broke. The view that they cannot is based on the false supposition
that they can and do always raise in taxes what they need to service their
debts.
Governments are, however, not countries. If the former Citibank chairman's
remark is taken literally to apply to countries, it is correct. An
organisation is bankrupt, broke or bust - call it what you will - if it
cannot meet its debts.
Countries cannot go broke or have surpluses or declare profits simply
because they are not that kind of entity. I would be astonished if any
reader of this column - even if he works in the IMF - has ever lent to a
country.
He may have written a submission about the desperate plight of Ruritania and
argued eloquently for concessionary lending. But to whom have the cheques
been written? For the kind of loan of which Mr Wriston was talking it would
almost certainly have been a government or state organisation.
I have been led to these musings by reflecting on the mundane subject of the
British balance of payments and trying to work out what the ultimate
differences are between those who see it as a problem and those who do not.
I want to go a little beyond the usual statistics and debating tricks on
either side. Of course I noticed that those who gleefully wrung their hands
in horror at the April UK trade deficit were engaging in the usual
short-term trick of going by one-month figures. Of course I noticed that if
you look at the right number - that is non-oil visible trade for the first
four months of the year - then the deterioration is only some Pounds 1.6bn
at an annual rate. The current account deficit so far this year is running
at about 1 per cent of GDP, well within the margin of error - a margin
skewed towards overestimate.
Of course I have been following Clifford Pratten's work which shows that the
value of overseas investments is rising sufficiently to offset quite a
substantial trade gap. Nor has the famous black hole either in the British
or the world balance of payments yet disappeared. The teenagers' guide has
been suspended while I have been on a sabbatical. But never fear it is
coming back.
Nevertheless I look at these numbers mainly to keep my end up. There is no
such thing as the 'British balance of payments deficit'. There are merely
debts, large or small, wise or unwise, accumulated by individuals,
companies, and other organisations, including central and local governments.
The concept of a balance of payments problem is a hangover from collectivist
economics. If a government is expected to run the whole economy then its
debts are the debts of the nation. But once the government is expected
mainly to look after its own debts the problem disappears.
The only difference between an excessive debt which I owe to a citizen of
Yorkshire and to a citizen of Texas is the additional element of exchange
risk - which, however important is but one of the many risks involved in all
borrowing and lending operations.
Therefore, even if I am completely wrong and people like Wynne Godley of
Cambridge are completely right in their view of the structural features of
the 'British economy', there is still no problem for macroeconomic policy.
The government still has several roles. It has some responsibility for the
efficiency of the market mechanism. It has to look after its own solvency
over several economic cycles. It is responsible for sustaining the value of
the currency. At this level of argument it does got matter whether it does
so by maintaining the exchange rate against a non-inflationary block,
successfully following a domestic monetary target or using some other
technique, so long as it looks after its own balance and tightens or loosens
monetary policy to minimise inflationary and deflationary disturbances.
Unfortunately many of those economists, who would naturally be making such
points, are so consumed with hostility to fixed exchange rates, Europe, John
Major or the ERM - in whichever form they see the devil - that they use
balance of payments figures for debating purposes and make common cause with
those who would like a Gosplan to take charge of all the nation's trade. If
you believe that the state is a civil association which provides the
framework for individuals and groups to carry out their own activities, then
there is no room for a balance of payments, only a government budget and an

FT  01 JUN 92 / Arts: Glittering history in Portman Square - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Patronage is a thing to celebrate and the flags are up in London's Portman
Square to mark 20 years of remarkable achievement of London's Heinz Gallery.
It was in May 1972 that the Queen opened the Heinz Gallery of the Royal
Institute of British Architects. This generous gift to England from Mr and
Mrs Henry J. Heinz II has been responsible for the rejuvenation of interest
in architectural history, drawings and models in a way that has been quite
extraordinary.
Brilliant curatorship and the encouragement of young architectural
historians have kept the Heinz at the forefront of both knowledge and
exhibitions. It is only the visible tip of the iceberg of one of the world's
richest collections of architectural drawings.
To celebrate its twentieth birthday the Heinz gallery is showing a
miscellany of recent acquisitions in a lively and enthralling display. It is
a pleasure to enter the darkened room that Alan Irvine designed for the
Heinz Gallery - there are two reasons. First it is like going into a richly
stocked and glittering shop of architectural drawings and models - sadly
none of them is for sale. Second, the gallery itself, which normally plays a
subservient role to the collection, can now be seen to have been a very
successful, elegant and calm setting for a diversity of exhibition displays.
When Alan Irvine, of the architects Buzas and Irvine, designed it he was
much influenced by the work of the Italian architect Carlo Scarpa. I think
it is that sense of Italian style that has given the Heinz a lasting
elegance - something that is quite rare in London galleries.
The current exhibition is an enjoyable miscellany that reveals the
discernment which has always marked the acquisition policy of the RIBA
Drawings Collection. It is a catholic policy that wisely takes an inclusive
historian's view and tries, perhaps not entirely consciously, to avoid the
divisive polemics which have polarised the recent architectural debate.
Modern architects will have their place in history and it is right that
stylistic considerations should sometimes take a back seat. The quality of
the recent acquisitions remains remarkably high despite the virtual
non-existence of any RIBA purchasing budget. The collection has always been
fortunate in its donors and the long tenure of the first curator, Mr John
Harris, certainly brought about a complete change in the value of
architectural drawings, both aesthetically and financially.
Rich gifts continue to enhance the collection and the donation of some 150
drawings by Joseph Bonomi (1739-1808), who was invited to England by the
Adam brothers, is one of the most generous recent examples. It is possible
to see in the exhibition his drawings for Roseneath, the great house outside
Glasgow, now demolished. Another eighteenth century practitioner who has
been added to the collection is Giacomo Leoni (c1686-1746) in the form of an
album of drawings for a London house in Arlington Street. His importance as
the publisher of the first edition of Palladio's 'Works' cannot be
underestimated.
I enjoyed seeing the lovely drawings for the grotto at Oatlands by Stephen
Wright and the drawing by Isaac Ware (who died in 1766) of an unexecuted
design for Westminster Bridge. The design model by CR Cockerell (1788-1863)
of Langton House in Dorset is a poignant reminder of another great house
that has been demolished. George Gilbert Scott is well represented in the
collection and the addition of the drawings for Kelham Hall are both
important and interesting examples of his domestic work. The nineteenth
century was a rich period for presentation drawings and a dense output of
material from the leading architects has posed major cataloguing problems
for the collection. Models too can impose storage problems but they are
important and much enjoyed by the public. How sad, for example, that all
that remains of the City of London's glorious cast-iron Coal Exchange is the
architect's model.
The twentieth century is almost over and the collection and this exhibition
shows both the strengths and weaknesses of the period. Lutyens's sketchbook
for Munstead Wood, on long-term loan from the Lutyens family, is an enticing
hint of the development that was to come of his early twentieth century
country houses. Sketches so often reveal more than the finished drawings and
this particular sketch book has a freshness and humour and cosiness that is
enchanting.
Cosy is not a word to be applied to the work of Erno Goldfinger - the
refugee who brought some of the Bauhaus tradition to England and left behind
in London the Trellick Tower in North Kensington (where the architect lived
for two weeks to show how wonderful life was in a tower block as long as you
could retreat to Hampstead) and London's Elephant and Castle development for
the London County Council. The work of Tecton is shown in the exhibition by
their drawings that showed how prefabricated houses could be treated with a
variety of facades - an exercise carried out for Peterlee New Town in 1949.
Patrick Gwynne shines out as an interesting and neglected modern architect
with his Blackheath houses that stand as modest beacons of successful new
house design of the 1960s.
It is time to cheer for the Heinz Gallery and all its works and to hope that
its original and stimulating approach to architecture and architectural
history will long continue in Portman Square.
The current celebratory exhibition continues until June 13 at the Heinz
Gallery, 21 Portman Square, London W1.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Arts: Russia comes to Israel - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A curious regathering of the clans is taking place in the Israeli theatre.
Of the 400,000 or so Soviet immigrants to the country since the end of 1989,
several hundred are actors and some of them, like Irina Selsiniova, the
actress who left the Mali Theatre in Leningrad, would be stars the world
over, in any language. They want to stay in Israel, learn Hebrew and go on
acting.
In general, Israeli reactions to the Russian influx are mixed. The
immigrants create short-term problems, such as how they can be housed and
fitted into the labour market. In the longer term, however, the influx
should be the most dynamic peaceful development in the country for decades.
Here are, for the most part, well-educated people who are prepared to work
and wish to settle.
So it is in the theatre. The curiosity is that there has been a Russian
liaison before.
In the old Hebrew culture, theatre did not exist. The first Hebrew theatre
was founded in Moscow in 1917 under the guidance of Stanislavsky and played
initially in Russian. It has been a voyage of discovery ever since, and
while the word from the professionals is that in the last five years the
theatre in Israel has been going through a dull patch, the arrival of the
Russians is already producing new waves.
Take just one example. A new company has been formed called the Gesher
Theatre (Gesher means bridge). It has been to New York with a production of
Tom Stoppard's Rosencrantz and Guildenstern Are Dead in a version translated
into Russian by Joseph Brodsky. I saw it in a small improvised hall in Tel
Aviv. It is electric and one can see immediately why dissident Russians so
admired the play. The man who plays Claudius looks as if he has stepped
straight out of the old Politburo: Polonius is pure apparatchik - none of
the old buffer of English performances; Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are the
informers so familiar in a communist society.
Yet the Gesher Theatre is not stopping there. Its members are busy learning
Hebrew several hours a day. Russian, on the other hand, will become the
second language of the theatre in Israel.
English is far behind, except in translation. Here again is a curious fact:
nearly half of Shakespeare's plays have never been translated into Hebrew.
The tragedies go down well - Hamlet is for all countries - but the comedies
tend to be regarded as artificial and the history plays are irrelevant. None
of the Henrys, I was told by Gary Bilu, the principle of the Beit Zvi School
of Stage and Cinematic Art, has ever been put into Hebrew. Yet his own
school is commissioning and performing Hebrew texts of virtually any modern
English play you can find.
We dropped in at a student rehearsal of Charlotte Keatley's My Mother Said I
Never Should. Bilu said that his school is British-oriented and its
principles based on RADA; what he wants to see, however, is practically the
entire theatrical canon available in Hebrew.
There is an absence of translations from Spanish. The Greek classics have
been translated, but seldom performed. A forthcoming production of Oedipus
at the Municipal Theatre in Haifa - one of Israel's top three venues - is
regarded as important by its director because it will show how different
Greek drama was.
Thus the voyage of discovery continues, yet it would be strong to say that
the indigenous theatre has gone to sleep. The fashionable view is that since
the outbreak of the intifada on the west bank in 1987, Israeli dramatists
have been practising a kind of self-censorship and have withdrawn from
political theatre. That was probably true as the shock of the uprising sank
in. Two recent productions, however, suggest a reawakening.
The first is Ya'ir by Danny Horowitz at the Haifa Municipal. This is the
story of Avraham Stern, the terrorist or freedom fighter who decided it was
legitimate to seek an alliance with the Germans in the fight against the
British. Stern was killed by the British in 1942 in circumstances that have
never been wholly explained.
Horowitz is a left-wing playwright and initially it was thought odd that he
should take on such a subject. Stern emerges as rather a romantic figure,
which indeed, with his academic background, he was. His widow gradually
agreed to co-operate with the play and has been attending performances. As a
production it is a trifle static, but it plainly breaks new ground. Horowitz
says that he would like to go on to re-examine other parts of recent Israeli
history.
That is exactly what happens in Yehu at the Habimah National Theatre in Tel
Aviv. Gilad Evron's central character is taken from the Book of Kings - Yehu
is a tyrant par excellence who has 70 members of the royal family beheaded.
The theme, however, is unmistakeably modern. It is that power corrupts
today, just as it always has. No one seeing Yehu could fail to think of
Israeli extremism run mad: it is also magnificently performed, notably a
chilling mutual suicide scene.
Perhaps the most interesting production is yet to come, and again it is a
case of bringing different cultures together. Next year there will be a
production of Romeo and Juliet by the Jerusalem Wall with the Montagues
played by Arabs in Arabic and the Capulets by Israelis in Hebrew.
Traditional Islam, like traditional Hebrew, never had much room for theatre,
but some of the Arabs are beginning to play a role. A mixture of Arab and
Hebrew has already been tried successfully in Waiting for Godot. As in the
Market Theatre in Johannesburg a few years ago, drama has a healing as well
as a disturbing influence.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Arts: Appliance of science - Sponsorship
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession is having one salutary effect on arts sponsors. It is forcing
them to evaluate their expenditure more scientifically. In the past
companies distributed largess freely, often deriving little in return but a
warm glow. Now chief executives, and especially finance directors, want a
justification for the budget. What were the objectives of the sponsorship
and were they realised?
Unfortunately, extensive market research into particular events can cost
almost as much as the original sponsorship, but some companies, such as
Lloyds, undertake an assessment as a matter of course. It evaluated its
investment in the Age of Chivalry exhibition at the Royal Academy, and
constantly measures the impact of its Young Musician of the Year link with
the BBC. BMW, which last week supported the opening concert of the Bath
Festival, is another company which researches its carefully pinpointed
sponsored events.
The latest to buy sponsorship research, through consultancy Millward Brown,
which specialises in the field, is NatWest. It made a commitment this year
to Welsh National Opera's Pelleas et Melisande, putting in Pounds 250,000 to
ensure the production fully realised the director's ambitions.
NatWest felt it was worthwhile measuring the result. The research suggested
that most (72 per cent) of the audience at the performances were aware that
NatWest sponsored the opera (way ahead of the 51 per cent norm at a
sponsored event), and they approved, appreciating that the production gained
from the money. An unexpected finding was that the audience felt NatWest
should have banged the drum of its involvement more loudly.
Millward Brown also quizzed NatWest's guests, the 50 or 60 existing or
potential customers that it invited to each performance. Here again they
welcomed the opportunity to meet their bank managers in a social context,
believing it would make doing business easier. NatWest will use the findings
to plan future sponsorships. It is aware that such research is necessarily
superficial. It cannot examine any increase in brand awareness, or
appreciation of NatWest, among the wider public and, anyway, the reaction of
the audience, and guests, is likely to be favourable.
Ironically this more business-like approach comes at a time when NatWest is
reducing its sponsorship budget in the wake of falling profits. But this way
the future lies. The Association for Business Sponsorship of the Arts is
devising a research facility for interested sponsors. It is well aware that
the case for backing the arts has to be made more forcefully and
persuasively in the current climate. It also knows that research could show
that sponsorship is a waste of time and money. But measuring the
effectiveness of sponsorship will inevitably become more important in the
cash-straitened future.
                        *       *      *
On June 13, Placido Domingo celebrates his 21st year as a Covent Garden
star, singing a title role in Samson et Dalila - and at the same time
helping Midland Bank to mark its 21st year as a Covent Garden sponsor. The
Midland Bank Proms, through which all the seats are removed from the stalls
of the Opera House and 700, mainly youthful, enthusiasts sit on the floor
for just Pounds 9, must be the longest major continuous arts sponsorship in
the UK.
It is one that excellently suits both parties. Covent Garden sheds its
elitist image for a few days and Midland Bank is seen in a favourable light
by its target audience of bright young things. It is an occasion now bathed
in history with no plans to break the connection.
The cost for Midland has risen sharply. At the first Prom, on September 28
1972, the audience paid 50p. The Bank makes up to Covent Garden the
difference between a sold-out stalls, with seats ranging from Pounds 70 to
Pounds 150, and the Pounds 9 bargain. It will foot a Pounds 250,000 bill
this year, for as an anniversary celebration, the five nights of opera
include not only Domingo, but Maria Ewing in Salome, and the first night,
next Monday, of a new production of Der fliegende Hollander.
All told over 100,000 Prommers have attended 143 opera and ballet
performances on the cheap. This year the number will be boosted by the
transmission on June 13 of Samson et Dalila live on the big screen into the
Covent Garden piazza. Not surprisingly, given its financial problems, the
Midland has cut its arts sponsorship in the last two years but it is staying
faithful to the Garden. As well as the Proms it backs the regional tour by
Birmingham Royal Ballet.
                        *       *      *
Next year a British writer will scoop up the Pounds 30,000 David Cohen
British Literature Prize in recognition of a lifetime's achievement at the
typewriter/word processor. This will be the Big One, beating in value the
other leading book awards, the Booker, by Pounds 10,000, and the NCR, by
Pounds 5,000. The Arts Council will chip in another Pounds 10,000 which goes
to a young writer of the winner's choice.
The cheque will be issued by Coutts Bank. Coutts has long literary
traditions - Dickens, Browning and Tennyson were customers - and it is
supplying the Arts Council and the David Cohen Trust with back up in
organising the prize.
Coutts carries out some discreet sponsorship of its own. It organises
concerts for its clients at which students of the Royal College of Music
play with established soloists. Earlier this year guitarist John Williams
performed; later this year it's the turn of percussionist Evelyn Glennie.
                        *       *      *
While more and more sponsors fail to renew their connections, arts
sponsorship could still grow this year, thanks to small sponsors dipping
their toe in the water.
The latest group to show an interest is hairdressers. Graham Webb
International has put up Pounds 1,000 to bring the National Youth Jazz
Orchestra to the Sevenoaks Festival. Last year a Hexham salon, Sherlock Hair
Shop, contributed Pounds 1,000 to coax Phoenix Dance Company to the
Northumbrian town.

The cleverest man I have known, and one of the wisest, was Sir Peter
Medawar. On the subject of human population he told me there was only one
certainty: people would worry, either because there were too many births or,
as in France after the Fist World War, too few. His wife, however, had no
doubts about the perils of population explosion: she ran the International
Planned Parenthood Federation. It was bumping into my headmaster, the father
of umpteen children, at one of her IPPF functions (inviting him had been my
idea of a joke) which led eventually to my expulsion from school . . . but I
digress. Horizon (8.10 BBC2) considers global population growth and asks the
crucial questions: when will the population reach the carrying capacity of
the planet and what happens then?
Few current affairs programmes have achieved as much pre-transmission
ballyhoo as today's World In Action (8.30 ITV). It had better be good. The
first of two parts, it investigates the members of the International Olympic
Committee and especially the president, Juan Samaranch.
Panorama ponders the forthcoming Earth Summit in Rio (9.30 BBC1).

FT  01 JUN 92 / Management: Toil and trouble / Assessment of how Sir John
Harvey-Jones' proteges have fared two years after starring on TV
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KATE BUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir John Harvey-Jones is one of Britain's best-known businessmen. Through
the BBC's 'Troubleshooter' series, he brought the secrets of management to
the living rooms of the British viewing public. 'Troubleshooter' was a great
success, attracting the highest audiences ever for a business series.
However, not all the companies involved are complimentary about Sir John's
management skills. Some claim they were duped by the BBC, being told the
series was a documentary about business and not an investigation into their
company.
Two years after broadcast, Sir John's troubleshooting on the six companies
involved has had mixed results. The Shropshire District Health Authority and
Copella Fruit Juices successfully followed his advice, although they did not
stick to his timetable.
Apricot Computers adopted much of the strategy that Sir John outlined, and
profits have risen as a result. However, the company claims that the
publicity from the programme was the 'worst piece of PR we ever
encountered'. Tri-ang was bought by the French corporation, SuperJouet, in
spite of Sir John's efforts, and ceased trading in the UK altogether.
Right from the outset, The Morgan Motor Company was resistant to Sir John's
advice. Two years on the company is flourishing, despite having ignored all
the Troubleshooter's recommendations.
In March 1989, when Sir John first visited the Malvern-based company, the
waiting period for a Morgan car was over 10 years and the factory produced
just nine cars a week. Turnover and profit plateaued in 1984, but Peter and
Charles Morgan, father and son partners in the family business, were secure
in the strong demand for their product. They showed a great reluctance to
increase production by any means that might spoil the cachet attached to
Britain's only hand-made motor-car.
The Morgans maintained a low selling price, a tradition that promoted Morgan
as an affordable luxury. They were, however, aware of the need to increase
profit to allow for future investment. In an effort to preserve the car's
prestige, their strategy was to make a small increase in production of a car
a week.
Sir John's solution was more radical. He suggested almost doubling output,
producing an extra 300 cars a year, slicing the waiting list in half, and
increasing the price of the car. 'He looked at Morgan from an accountant's
point of view,' says Charles Morgan, 'Sir John failed to take into account
the fact that Morgan wants to be here in 100 years' time.' It seems that Sir
John was intent on squeezing the company into a mould abhorrent to its
owners.
The Morgans continued on their original course, despite Sir John's warning
that the Morgan Motor Company would disappear down a black hole of
increasing labour and material costs.
Three years later, despite a decline in the classic car market, the Morgan
is up and running. The company has increased its profits from Pounds 488,000
in 1989 to Pounds 910,000 last year, a performance which has made the
Morgans damning of Sir John's troubleshooting skills.
'He has his own inimitable style,' says Charles Morgan, 'whether that is
suited to British business I do not know. He's certainly not the guru that I
would turn to in the motor industry.' Charles Morgan is currently taking an
MBA in business studies at Coventry Polytechnic where he has been learning
of management systems more to his liking than those preached by Sir John.
The Morgans deny accusations that they run the Morgan Motor Company as a
hobby and claim that the proof of a professionally run business is strong
profit and a solid customer base, 'We have both,' says Charles Morgan.
Sir John enjoyed more success troubleshooting at Churchill Tableware, a
ceramics company in Stoke-on-Trent.
The company, run by the three Roper brothers, made a record profit of Pounds
1.5m in 1988, but the following year the domestic tableware division went
into serious decline. When Sir John arrived at Churchill, he was faced with
the problem of cutting costs while establishing a niche in the domestic
tableware market. A catalogue of problems left plenty of room for
improvement.
He found that there was a conflict of priorities between the brothers, who
concentrated on different aspects of the business, thus confusing the
overall strategy.
The Ropers were engrossed in the minutiae of the business and failed to lead
the company successfully. Sir John advised them to relinquish some
responsibility to the frustrated middle management, convinced that they
would rise to the challenge.
He also discovered that the newly installed computerised kilns had a
voracious appetite for clay. In an effort to meet this demand the factory
produced enormous amounts of inexpensive tableware.
Sir John demanded more investment in design, increasing the quality and
range of products. He also suggested a higher level of automation to reduce
the high wage bill (then 36 per cent of production). He estimated Pounds 1m
a year could be saved by installing machines that would cut 100 jobs.
According to Michael Roper, this was not economically viable. 'We did invest
in some machines, but a single machine can cost Pounds 50,000 and an
employee in Stoke costs Pounds 200 a week. You have to weigh it up on the
short term and the long term.'
Neither do the brothers agree on the point of internal conflict. Stephen
Roper says: 'With regard to the three of us working together, I don't
believe that there ever was a problem. I think that was just the
'Troubleshooter' programme looking for an angle that didn't exist.'
Nevertheless, the Ropers have spent more on design and now sell an upmarket
range which has successfully established itself in the market. They also
took time out of the office for brainstorming sessions on strategy, and have
relinquished many of the problem-solving tasks to a grateful management, who
indeed showed their true potential.
With pretax profit up to Pounds 3m in 1991, the Ropers still turn to Sir
John for advice long after the 'Troubleshooter' series was broadcast. 'Sir
John's visit was an extremely positive episode in the life of Churchill. He
acted as a catalyst. His visit galvanised more action than we were prepared
to take at that stage', says Stephen Roper.
Sir John's degree of success varies, depending on who sits in judgment.
He does not claim to be a management consultant nor a business guru, but
states his prime objective was to correct some of the anti-business feeling
that he is convinced exists in Britain and raise the awareness of the
British public in commercial matters. In this respect, he undeniably
succeeded.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Management: The great top-down fallacy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Is your company trying to become leaner, faster and more competitive by
'empowering' its employees? If so, and the company is British, there is a
strong chance that it is going about the process in the wrong way.
First, too many UK companies start the change process from grand
abstractions such as 'culture' or 'better communications', rather than from
challenges which people in the front line can understand, such as specific
aspects of better customer service.
Second, companies fall for the 'top-down' fallacy: the idea that all the
necessary changes (new structures, reward mechanisms and so on) should be
decided at the top of the company, and then 'cascaded' down the
organisation.
Instead, a 'top-bottom-middle' approach is far more effective, in which the
initiative for changing all sorts of smaller-scale company practices is
handed directly to local teams in the places where the issues manifest
themselves. As these local initiatives begin to bite, middle managers then
need help in dealing with them, and in learning how to encourage rather than
frustrate further efforts.
Third, too many companies attempt to spread the learning created through
these local initiatives by trying to draw it up to the top and push it down
again. Instead, they should promote learning across the organisation.
Fourth, changes in the company's infrastructure - its formal organisation,
pay mechanisms, budgeting systems and so on - should be left until after the
other steps. Most British companies try to change such structures first.
These four tips form the essence of a short monograph on 'building the
empowered organisation', just published by Kinsley Lord, a London-based
consultancy specialising in the management of change.
Though primarily a promotional tool, the booklet is of wider value for the
challenges it throws at UK management. Contrary to sceptics' claims, it
insists that empowerment is possible in Britain. But it has a sting in its
tail: 'The question for British chief executives is whether they have the
conviction, the will and the ability to lead their companies in this way.'

FT  01 JUN 92 / Management: Secret confessions of a secretary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Secretaries resent their bosses; bosses treat their secretaries as mindless
typing machines. The relationship in Britain is famously poor: the latest
survey by the Industrial Society showed that bosses do not like secretaries
who stand up for themselves, show confidence or have a sense of humour.
In defiance of this image, a leading City figure and his loyal, long-serving
secretary recently took to the stage at a conference in London to prove just
how perfect the relationship could be.
George Mallinckrodt, executive chairman of Schroders, the merchant bank, and
Janice Nowak described to a couple of hundred well-groomed top secretaries
how to make the 'partnership' work.
According to Mallinckrodt, the secretary's main job is to organise him. To
do this she needs to be a skilful diplomat, capable of deciding which of the
'900 prima donnas' within the company he has time to see. She must also play
the ambassadress, speak many foreign languages, know when Ramadan is, and be
able to recognise voices on the phone she has only heard once before. She
must have a photographic memory, anticipate all his needs, and remind him to
write thank-you letters.
Nowak, an articulate graduate in languages seemed to take the job in her
stride. The skills she found necessary were:
Understanding. 'You must understand the aims of the person and how they
work,' she warned. 'If he says 10 minutes, but you know it will take three
quarters of an hour, plan for that, but don't let him know'.
Communication. This is essential: 'He must tell you what is going on, where
and why.' The communication must work both ways.
Anticipation. If he his going on a trip, make sure he has the papers he is
likely to need when he gets there.
Memory. 'If you can't remember something said to you three to six months
ago, you'll look silly'.
Admit fallibility. 'If you have made a mistake or forgotten something, admit
it at once.'
The lessons seemed lost on the audience. It would appear that this vision of
give and take, with a boss who loves to be organised, and a happy, fulfilled
secretary is not the norm.
The other secretaries attending the London conference entitled 'Successful
Partnership with the Boss', organised by IIR conference group, seemed
concerned by more mundane affairs. Their bosses would not surrender their
diaries, they complained, and got furious every time they were double
booked.
Some secretaries said that word processors had given them even more work to
do: bosses insisted that letters and memos be changed a dozen times before
sending them out. Others who worked for two bosses found that each time they
did something for one of them, the other sulked.
The main complaint from the high-flyers was that they were expected to work
longer and longer hours, had more tasks delegated to them, but felt forever
excluded from the management team.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Many shopworkers face freeze on pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOUSANDS of shopworkers face pay freezes in 13 retail companies this year,
while other retailers are offering rises above the rate of inflation,
according to IDS, an independent pay analysis body.
Non-food companies such as Allied Maples and Foster Menswear will freeze pay
this year. Others, including Habitat, House of Fraser and Robert Dyas will
review their freezes in six months. Some employers who announced freezes for
most of their staff have increased the wages of the lowest paid because of
the rise in statutory rates set by the retail wages councils.
However, some companies are paying rises above inflation. WH Smith and the
Retail Book Association negotiated a deal under which staff will get a 5 per
cent rise from February this year with a further 3 per cent from August.
Marks and Spencer is to pay staff a cash bonus worth Pounds 5 a week to a
third of its shopworkers and is introducing performance pay as a reward for
the company's strength in the recession. The move is surprising because in
1990 the company paid staff a flat-rate rise of Pounds 31.50 to last for
three years and three months.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Reform call for textiles industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TEXTILES industry in the Scottish Borders region needs radical
restructuring and an infusion of new capital and ideas if it is to survive,
say consultants appointed after a series of job losses in the industry.
Werner International, the consultants, urges the industry to make good a
long-term lack of investment in production equipment, to improve training
and to attract a younger labour force.
The consultants praise the quality of the area's textiles production, 70 per
cent of which is exported, but say weavers that persist with classic
Scottish products will have difficulty in surviving as tastes change and
Italian competition intensifies. They also warn that weaving companies are
vulnerable because they depend on a UK clothing market that is in
'irreversible contraction'.
Spinning companies should be able to defend their position, the consultants
say. Knitwear will face growing competition from China, especially if
Japanese companies operating there improve the quality of Chinese knitwear.
Spinning, weaving and knitwear are the main industry in the Borders region,
employing 5,500 workers. The report was commissioned last year by Scottish
Borders Enterprise, the region's enterprise company, after numerous mill
closures and the loss in two years of 1,000 jobs.
Werner says smaller borders textile groups should approach Japanese, EC and
US textile companies to buy the Scottish companies or set up joint ventures
with them. Borders companies should themselves create larger groupings
through mergers.
Werner advises Scottish Borders Enterprise to promote the creation of
marketing companies to function as co-operatives, and to establish a product
development and design centre to provide consultancy services. Scottish
Borders Enterprise said at a conference of industry leaders in Galashiels,
Roxburghshire, last week that it would lead an initiative to encourage the
industry to change its ways.
The Werner report says that while larger companies are diversifying into
non-traditional products, smaller companies need to follow suit and to
develop stronger overseas marketing links.
The smaller knitwear companies need to adopt an 'industrial' rather than an
'artisanal' approach to manufacturing, the consultants say.
The consultants found that only two Borders knitwear companies employ
workers of the youngest employable generation, with the others relying on
highly skilled older workers. Efforts must be made to recruit and train a
new generation of textile workers, the consultants say.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Union backs plan to merge
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEADERSHIP of the Nupe public-service union yesterday won the backing of
its annual conference for plans to merge with the Nalgo and Cohse unions.
The proposals, which aim to create Britain's biggest union with 1.5m
members, were supported less enthusiastically than expected.
The 4,980 to 3,099 vote suggested that the merger, which will be decided in
a ballot of all the members of the three unions, is not a foregone
conclusion.
Some delegates were concerned about the likely resistance of any Nalgo
members to affiliating to the Labour party. Nalgo is not affiliated, whereas
Cohse and Nupe are. Other delegates said there might be defections to other
largely blue-collar unions.
The proposals will face a stronger test in a fortnight when Nalgo's annual
conference votes on them.
The National Union of Journalists was threatened with defections yesterday
after one of its largest office branches voted against staying in the
organisation.
Members of the 288-strong Daily Mirror chapel decided by 94 votes to 76 not
to stay in the union.
One possibility is that they will join the British Association of
Journalists, which is being set up by Mr Steve Turner, a former Daily Mirror
journalist who was dismissed as NUJ general secretary last year after
clashes with the union's executive.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Barry ready to harry supporters of Militant: The man who
today becomes leader of Britain's biggest Civil Service union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOP JOB at Britain's biggest Civil Service union changes hands today.
But the elevation of Mr Barry Reamsbottom, a 43-year-old Scot, to the Pounds
43,000-a-year general secretary's post will inspire only limited envy, even
among the most ambitious of trade unionists.
In recent years internecine warfare between moderates and the far left at
the CPSA has made the post one of the toughest and least rewarding among
senior union jobs.
Whereas most UK union general secretaries stay on until their retirement or
near it, the two most recent incumbents of the CPSA have both left
relatively early. Mr Alistair Graham quit in his early 40s and Mr John
Ellis, who recently moved to head the Council of Civil Service Unions, is
53.
Thus Mr Reamsbottom becomes the third man in a decade to take on the general
secretary's job. He will make full use of the tough character his background
and experience have equipped him with.
Mr Reamsbottom learnt to fend for himself earlier than most when he spent
eight years of his childhood in a Roman Catholic children's home after his
parents separated.
The experience also influenced his politics. 'Seeing the kids from problem
families made me acutely aware of social injustice and I was out campaigning
for the Labour party when I was 15,' he says. 'The nuns who ran the home
considered me a communist.'
The nuns were wrong if they thought he was developing into a political
extremist: Mr Reamsbottom has always been in the mainstream of the Labour
party. One of his first declarations on his election was that he would
'harry the alien influence of Militant' out of the organisation.
That will prove virtually impossible. Militant has a stronger influence on
the CPSA than it has on virtually any other union. It gained control of the
executive in 1987-88 and will not give it up easily.
However, for the first time for five years Militant has no supporter in any
of the top six jobs at the union, and only three of the 26-strong executive
are aligned to it.
In addition, Mr Reamsbottom is perhaps better equipped than his predecessor
to take on the left wing because he enjoys doing so. The latest edition of
the union newspaper, which he edited, records with apparent pride how he was
greeted with 'boos, catcalls and whistles' from the largely leftwing annual
conference when it was informed of his election.
Mr Reamsbottom would no doubt prefer not to have to deal with a conference
which he describes as a 'crazy festival'. But he is adept at doing so, and
with Mrs Marion Chambers, the union president, is famous for devising
procedural and other methods to sidestep and thwart their wishes and motions
if they are 'unrepresentative'.
'Barry is the archetypal machine politician,' says one admirer. 'Few people
know the union as well as he does and is as comfortable operating within
it.'
Critics and even some of his supporters say he has yet to prove himself as a
top negotiator. Such skills will be at a premium at a time when the
government is planning profound changes through devolution of pay bargaining
and contracting out of services to the private sector.
The left wing, and not just in the CPSA, fear that Mr Reamsbottom will give
too much away. Mr Leslie Christie, general secretary of the NUCPS Civil
Service union, says: 'My concern is that he will collaborate with the
employers almost at any price rather than fight back.'
Mr Christie's fears have been heightened by the decision by Mr Reamsbottom
and his executive to recommend this year's offer of a 4.75 per cent pay rise
and a significant extension of performance pay.
Mr Reamsbottom makes no apologies. 'We have doubts about performance pay, we
would rather it wasn't there. But the government wants it and we are not
going to fight the wind.
'By negotiating constructively, we have been able to ensure far greater
protection for poor performers than was originally proposed. And we have a
clause ensuring that devolution of pay bargaining will only happen with full
consultation of the union.'
Mr Reamsbottom promises a similarly pragmatic approach to competing with the
private sector for tenders. 'We totally oppose the contracting out of
services because of its effect on jobs and quality. But if it comes, we will
negotiate the best framework possible and prepare ourselves to to win the
contracts.'
The threat to membership levels posed by contracting-out will be
counterbalanced in part by opening regional offices, increasing contact with
members and improving services.
Mr Reamsbottom admits that none of that is particularly original. 'I do not
have a great, grand strategy that no one has ever thought of, he says. 'But
I do think that unions have become too remote from their members and that is
a problem we can tackle by tried and tested means.'

FT  01 JUN 92 / Gadaffi's guns elude police dragnets / Tracing an enigma
within a mystery from its start in a secluded Irish cove
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM COONE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLOGGA STRAND does not appear on most tourist maps of Ireland.
It is about 50 miles south of Dublin, a secluded, mile-long bay with golden
sand, where oyster and mussel shells crunch underfoot at the high tide mark.
No road or track reaches the beach, and only shore anglers and other people
in the know are likely to turn up there. Set back from the seashore is a
cluster of isolated cottages with innocuous names such as Journey's End and
Shady Nook. At Clogga Strand, though, they have an intensely ironic meaning.
For it was here in 1985 and 1986 that the chief quartermasters of the
Provisional IRA carried out one of the biggest and most successful arms
smuggling operation in the IRA's history. Four shipments from Libya were
unloaded in the bay and provided the IRA with an estimated 150 tons of
weaponry.
To date, it is independently estimated that only between a quarter and a
third of the weapons landed in the first four shipments has been captured by
security forces, although the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) in Northern
Ireland and the Gardai police forces in the Republic claim that the figure
is closer to half.
It included automatic rifles, heavy machine guns, anti-aircraft missiles,
millions of rounds of ammunition and several tons of the powerful Semtex
explosive. The operation was disclosed after the capture of a small coastal
freighter, the Eksund, off France in 1987. A further 150 tons of weapons
were aboard, also destined for Clogga Strand.
Most of the rest is widely believed to be stored in bunkers scattered about
the Republic of Ireland. It is thought that there may be as many as 4,000
AK47 automatic rifles, several hundred machine guns and well over a million
rounds of ammunition.
Mr Ken Maginnis, Ulster Unionist MP for Fermanagh and South Tyrone and his
party's spokesman on security matters, said: 'I am firmly convinced that if
the Special Branch (in the Republic) was given the resources it could do a
better job. It is under-resourced and underfunded in every respect.'
Early last February, days after Mr Albert Reynolds succeeded Mr Charles
Haughey as Irish prime minister, the Gardai set in motion Operation Silo.
Acting on intelligence reports, they uncovered a series of IRA bunkers in
the southern counties of Kerry, Limerick and Kilkenny. The dragnet has since
extended to Cork, where this month the biggest haul since 1988 was made. It
uncovered 51 AK47 automatic rifles, a DShK heavy machine-gun - a type used
with success against British Army helicopters in the north - and 20,000
rounds of ammunition.
The succession of finds prompted one Dublin magazine to publish a cartoon
showing one farmer leaning on a fence and saying to another: 'That field is
corn, those two are barley and the far one is semi-automatic rifles.'
The IRA's caches in the Republic range from purpose-built concrete bunkers
capable of holding several tons of weapons usually concealed under a farm
building, to plastic barrels containing only a few rifles or pistols and a
few hundred rounds of ammunition and buried in a field next to a culvert or
ditch.
The biggest find, after the Eksund capture, was in January 1988, when 100
AK47s, five heavy machine guns and 50,000 rounds of ammunition were
discovered hidden in sand dunes in the northern county of Donegal. All the
arms finds since then in the Republic do not equal that one discovery.
Since 1987, the RUC, British army and Gardai together have captured about
500,000 rounds of ammunition and some 350 AK47s.
Detailed figures on Semtex are unavailable, but the RUC estimates that 1 1/2
tons has been used or recovered in the north.
Mr Maginnis said he had put down several parliamentary questions to find out
how many of the weapons are still in IRA hands, but without success. 'When
the government wants to hide failures,' he said, 'it says it cannot reveal
the information for security reasons.'
Up to a year ago he said that no more than a fifth of the Libyan-supplied
weapons had been discovered. The reported finds of the security forces since
then would increase that figure to no more than a quarter.
Mr Maginnis said: 'On the present rate of discoveries, even if 50 tons have
been found over the past seven years, that means there is sufficient left
for the IRA to carry on until the year 2010.'
In a similar vein, Mr Alan Shatter, the justice spokesman for the opposition
Fine Gael party in the republic, said: 'There is concern that we are only
scratching the surface.'
There is uncertainty over whether the IRA has widely dispersed its weaponry,
or whether there remain several large caches, under the control of just a
few key IRA quartermasters.
The Gardai declined to divulge figures on the number of Special Branch
detectives dedicated to anti-IRA duties, but confirmed that the job fell
largely to local detective units who also have to deal with common crime and
are backed up by Special Branch units only in some larger cities. Mr
Maginnis would seem to have cause for complaint.
It is the frustration with the limited success rate against the IRA's
logistic supply lines that has convinced unionist politicians in the north
that the best way of disrupting the IRA's military campaign is to use
selective internment against the suspected quartermasters.
Much may hinge on what Col Gadaffi, the Libyan leader, decides to do. To
ease mounting international pressure against him over the Pan Am Lockerbie
bombing, he recently offered to co-operate with the UK authorities on
disclosing his past links with the IRA. Will he be prepared to detail the
shipments that got through and name the IRA quartermasters with whom he
dealt?
The fact that so few of the Libyan-supplied arms have been used has prompted
the observation that either the IRA has far more weapons than people trained
to use them, or the weapons themselves are not particularly suited to the
IRA's present strategy.
A renewed political vacuum in Ulster should the current inter-party talks
end again in deadlock and the new Northern Ireland ministerial team bowing
to Unionist demands is the kind of scenario in which the weapons might be
brought out of their bunkers. Operation Silo has so far done little to
prevent that happening.

</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SIR PATRICK MAYHEW, Northern Ireland secretary, faces a tough meeting with
the province's political leaders today that may decide the future of the
government's latest attempt to resolve political differences by dialogue.
If a dispute between unionist and nationalist leaders over procedure cannot
be resolved, Sir Patrick will soon face the choice of imposing his own
decision or shelving the five-week-old initiative.
A sub-committee set up last week to resolve the differences appears to have
made some headway, but it is unclear whether its proposals will be
acceptable to party leaders.
The row is over when to move from debate on government in the province to
the planned second 'strand' of talks - the point at which the Irish
government would enter to discuss Northern Ireland's relations with the
south.
Sir Patrick is expected to be less tolerant of delays than his predecessor,
Mr Peter Brooke. He may decide to force the pace - by deciding unilaterally
on a date for strand two, for instance - or to suspend the initiative in the
hope that it could be revived later.
Even if a solution is found, the gloom surrounding the talks is a setback
for government hopes that distrust between nationalists and unionists had
eased sufficiently for an agreement on new political structures in the
province.
Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian Paisley, the two unionist leaders, are
understood to be worried at the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour
party's proposals for giving the Irish government a role in the affairs of
Northern Ireland.
Many in the SDLP believe the unionists are deliberately delaying progress
because of their nervousness about talking to the Irish government.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR BRYAN GOULD, a cand-idate for the Labour leadership, said yesterday that
the party's link with the unions was 'valuable' and would be 'a source of
strength as it has been in the past'.
The link needed to be adjusted, but not broken, he said on BBC television.
'We should certainly not conduct this debate as though the link with the
trade unions is some sort of burden that we have to put up with because it
is inevitable.'
His comments and those of other senior figures in the party and union
movement highlighted the growing demands of those seeking a 'fundamental
overhaul' of the Labour party and the pressures on candidates for the party
leadership to defend its historic traditions.
In an interview on TV-am, Mr Jack Cunningham, the party's campaign
co-ordinator, reiterated his support for the abandonment of the Labour rule
book's Clause 4, which calls for public ownership, and warned that the way
the party conducts its affairs was putting off voters.
His comments appeared tacitly to back a sharply diminished union role as
part of a 'fundamental overhaul' of the party's image.
'For too many people, the Labour party still remains a closed organisation,
an organisation that is difficult to join, very difficult to participate
effectively in,' he said.
His views were echoed by Mr Gavin Laird, general secretary of the AEEU
engineering workers' and electricians' union, who used an article in the
union's newspaper to attack the 'antiquated' links between the party and the
unions.
Mrs Margaret Beckett, the favoured candidate of Mr John Smith in the deputy
leadership race, denied on London Weekend Television either that she was
slipping behind or that she was the establishment candidate.

FOREIGN companies in the west Midlands are planning to increase their
investment this year, according to a survey published today by accountants
KPMG Peat Marwick and the West Midlands Development Agency. The survey of
344 companies employing 68,000 people uncovered capital expenditure plans
this year totalling Pounds 147m. About two thirds of the investment will
come from companies owned in the US, Germany and Japan.
Although half the respondent companies this year expect an increase in
turnover, broadly reflecting the sentiment of domestic companies, the
recession led more than two in five foreign companies to report results
worse than they had originally expected.
Foreign companies have thus been caught up in the difficulties of the
engineering industry, highlighted over the past two years in the domestic
sector by a progressive rundown in the number of people employed.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE POTENTIAL for recovery in the housing market is more firmly based than
at any time in the past three years, a report by research group Cambridge
Econometrics says today, Alan Pike writes.
It says prospective purchasers' ability to afford to buy homes has returned
to levels that existed before the 1988-89 boom and will continue to improve.
Mortgage repayments, which accounted for 44 per cent of average earnings in
the first quarter of 1990, fell to 28 per cent by the end of last year.
Activity in the housing market remained flat in spite of that improvement,
the report says, because of low consumer confidence in the face of rising
unemployment and the uncertainty that prevailed before the general election.
The most pessimistic set of future assumptions, the report says, implies a
marginal rise in the repayment ratio from about 28 per cent of average
earnings to 29 per cent - still well below the peak reached in early 1990. A
mid-range scenario suggests a continued improvement in affordability to 26
per cent.

FT  01 JUN 92 / University decides to stick to the federation trail: The row
over department mergers at Manchester
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANCHESTER University is expected to go ahead with a plan to federate the
separate management research and education activities of Manchester Business
School, University of Manchester Institute of Science and Technology (Umist)
and the university's department of accounting unless Mr John Patten, the
education secretary, intervenes.
The move will be in spite of the resignation of 14 senior business leaders
of the business school's council. They allege that the university does not
understand the nature of the partnership needed for successful management
education between business and academic skills.
The 14 executives are led by Sir Dennis Landau, chief executive of the
Co-operative Wholesale Society. They include Sir Peter Middleton, chairman
of Barclays de Zoete Wedd, the investment bank, and a former Treasury
permanent secretary. The 14 have asked Mr Patten to step in. They want
Manchester Business School to enjoy similar autonomy from its parent
university as London Business School, which was set up at the same time in
the mid 1960s after the Franks report had called for management education to
be improved. The council would govern it.
Manchester University, however, wants to pull together the three disparate
strands of business and management education and research and try to create
a world-class institution with about 150 staff. The proposed institution
would build on existing and extensive links and collaboration with industry.
The present row has surfaced after 10 years of growing tension. 'Someone
should have knocked all the heads together about five years ago,' one former
member of the business school faculty said yesterday.
There have been two sources of tension - one between the university and the
business school, and the other within the school itself. The latter lies in
a clash between academic and vocational views of management education and
research.
Some staff are highly qualified academics with strings of publications to
their names, while others are more practical in their approach, with less of
an academic background but contributing their experience to the job.
The depth of the split in the school is shown by the faculty's vote on
whether to support the plan for federation. The university has emphasised
that 'a majority' favoured its plan, but voting was 29 to 28, with some of
the more vocationally based staff worried about their career prospects if
more emphasis were placed on academic rather than practical achievement.
The split between the academic and vocational approaches is mirrored in the
tension between the school and the university. Another academic involved
says the university is jealous of its reputation as the 'Oxford of the
north'. 'There is a lot of snootiness about the backgrounds of some members
of the school's staff,' he says.
The annual research ratings of the government's Universities Funding Council
have intensified the conflict, with the business school scoring only three
out of five, based on such criteria as quality of research and international
publications.
Umist has scored four or five out of five in recent assessments, while the
department of accounting - part of the university's faculty of economics and
social science - has also been doing better than the business school.
Umist, which grew out the 19th-century Manchester Mechanics' Institute and
has a self-governing status separate from the university which the business
school covets, is also understood to be not entirely happy with the
university's plans because its own management school is a principal pillar
of Umist's structure.
However, it has already agreed to offer joint engineering degrees with its
university departmental counterparts and appears to have bowed to the
inevitable, with the federation idea an uneasy compromise short of full
integration.
Tensions in the business school have affected morale. Professor Roy Payne,
who is widely respected for his work on organisational structure and
behaviour, grew weary of the politics and resigned as dean last year. He now
has a chair at Sheffield University.
The future of Professor Tom Cannon, the school's director, is in doubt.
University insiders say he will announce his departure when he returns from
study leave this week. He has two years of a five-year contract still to run
and has managed the school profitably.
Prof Cannon, a well-known researcher on small business, was originally
expected to come down on the academic side of the argument and support
integration. He fought instead for more autonomy and the right to appoint
any staff he felt were needed.
'He has done nothing wrong, so he can't be sacked,' one insider said
yesterday. 'If he goes, it will be because they have come to an arrangement
to buy him out so the university can have its way.'

FT  01 JUN 92 / Riverbus survives storm at Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RIVERBUS, the Thames passenger service, won a reprieve yesterday when Ernst
&amp; Young, the administrators of Canary Wharf, said it could continue even
though it depends on Olympia &amp; York, which owns the crisis-ridden building,
as its main backer.
The high-speed service, which runs between Chelsea and Greenwich, is
underpinned financially by O&amp;Y and has so far made big losses. Since its
launch in the mid 1980s it has needed a Pounds 2.5m injection by a
consortium of five property developers and a government grant of Pounds
500,000.
Analysts had considered it a likely early casualty once O&amp;Y went into
administration.
Riverbus is owned by a partnership of O&amp;Y and the property division of P&amp;O,
the shipping company, which is the developer of Chelsea Harbour. P&amp;O manages
Riverbus via seconded managers, but has no liabilities and owns less than 6
per cent of the issued share capital.
P&amp;O welcomed the administrators' decision. It said: 'We are quite happy to
leave our manager in there to keep it running . . . It's the only form of
commuter transport on the river at the moment.'
Instead of marking its death knell, yesterday turned out to be one of
Riverbus's best days.
Business on all its craft was brisk as Londoners and tourists travelled in
sunshine to look at the building which the past week's welter of cartoons
and photographs has turned into a famous landmark.
One employee said: 'The first boat was full and we had to turn people away
in the end because it was so busy. We've been doing extremely well.'
It remains unclear how many of Riverbus's passengers were prospective
tenants or predators, and how many simply wanted to see the Canary Wharf
tower.
Docklands may have potential as a tourist destination. The top of the tower
was opened to the families of potential investors for a brief period in
February and March, when O&amp;Y was attempting to raise finance via a tax
shelter scheme.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Closure threat to two north-east coal mines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO coal mines in north-east England may close shortly, leaving only three
working pits in the region.
Easington, in County Durham, faces a review that will decide its future, and
nearby Vane Tempest, near Newcastle upon Tyne, will be reviewed shortly
afterwards. If the two pits close, nearly 1,500 jobs will be lost at
Easington, and a further 900 jobs will be lost at Vane Tempest.
Both collieries have had considerable financial difficulties. Vane Tempest
made a loss of Pounds 922,000 in the first six weeks of this financial year,
mainly because the colliery had failed to open enough new coal faces to
maintain output.
At Easington production has improved and losses have been reduced since
January, but Mr Brian Wright, group director for the region, said in
February that the pit had to sustain its performance to stay open.
Mr Tom Watson, manager of Westoe colliery, which has been mainly profitable
since the mid 1980s, said last week he might be able to offer jobs to miners
made redundant.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Charity funds for Tories attacked
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Charity Commission has backed a complaint about a registered charity's
funding of the Conservative party in elections for Westminster City Council.
Mr Andrew Dismore, leader of the Labour opposition on the council,
complained to the commission about the Foundation for Business
Responsibilities making payments to Marketforce Communications, a
public-relations company.
The company was employed by Westminster council's Conservatives to promote
their party before the May 1990 local elections, in which the Tories
increased their majority over Labour on the council.
The commission's rules bar charities from engaging in political activities.
The foundation was established in 1972 as an educational trust.
In a letter to Mr Dismore, the commission said the charity paid more than
Pounds 98,000 to Marketforce, and the payment infringed charity rules. The
money has been repaid to the charity by its trustees, although yesterday it
was still not clear where the refund came from.
Mr Dismore said yesterday that he was seeking an Inland Revenue
investigation into the foundation to discover if it has breached laws
concerning tax relief for charities.
He has also written to Dame Shirley Porter, the Conservative leader of the
council at the time of the payments, asking for clarification of her
involvement with the use of the charity's funds for politically motivated
public-relations work for her party.
A representative of Dame Shirley, who is abroad on holiday, yesterday denied
that she had any connection with the foundation.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Pre-tax petrol price 'low in real terms'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRICE of petrol last year in real terms and net of taxes was the lowest
since 1969, and the second-lowest ever, according to a report on the vehicle
fuels market by the Gilbert Jenkins research consultancy.
The tax-free petrol price in real terms was less than a third of its level
in 1912, the first year of records, although the tax element has trebled in
the same period, the report says. The net price has been similar in 10 other
years, but only in 1969 was it marginally lower.
In terms of consumer price, while competition and varying exchange rates
mean the situation can change rapidly, the report finds that in February
this year the UK had the second-lowest petrol prices in Europe after
Switzerland. The report also finds that sales of unleaded petrol have grown
rapidly since its introduction in the UK in 1987. From a 1 per cent market
share in that year, it grew to account for about a third of all petrol sold
in 1990.
A new super unleaded grade introduced in 1990 took 4 per cent of the market.
Sales were helped by a tax advantage of more than 3p a litre.
The report points to an increasing trend towards petrol marketing at retail
sites, with chains such as Tesco and J. Sainsbury often running petrol
stations.
The share of petrol sold through motorway and big-store sites increased from
0.9 per cent in 1977 to 12 per cent in 1991, and is forecast to reach 20 per
cent by 1995.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Attitudes harden in Gaza: Conditions worsening in the
occupied territories
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DR MAHMOUD ZAHAR, a prominent supporter of the Islamic fundamentalist
movement in the Gaza Strip, shed few tears last week over the fate of a
15-year-old Israeli schoolgirl stabbed to death in a Tel Aviv suburb a few
days before by a young unemployed Palestinian.
In fact, he was indignant. Why was the world so concerned about the killing
of one Israeli girl when, for years, countless Palestinian children had been
killed by Israelis occupying their land, he asked. 'We do not advocate
killing children, but this is a war.'
As Israelis celebrate the 25th anniversary of their victory in the Six-Day
War of June 1967, there is ample evidence of the iron fist which the Israeli
army deploys to keep order in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and east Jerusalem -
and of the bitter resistance to it.
In the Jabalya refugee camp in Gaza, the sandy alleyways between the squalid
dwellings are scorched black by burning roadblocks thrown up almost daily by
rioting youths. A watchtower reminiscent of a prison camp and surrounded by
high fencing was erected recently to help the troops keep a lid on the
unrest.
'The level of frustration on the ground has substantially increased,' said a
foreign aid worker with several years of experience in Gaza. 'The economic
situation has got worse and worse. This is all contributing to a growing
sense of helplessness and frustration.'
People in Gaza talk about a watershed in the tiny, overcrowded territory
after the Gulf war early last year. They say army policy became tougher
against a population that had sided with Iraq against the US and its allies,
including Israel.
The authorities imposed much tougher conditions on Gazans working in Israel,
reducing numbers and weakening the main prop of the impoverished Gazan
economy. The population of Gaza has almost doubled since 1967 to 750,000, of
whom 550,000 are refugees registered with UNRWA, the UN's Palestinian
refugee welfare organisation. It is projected to double again in 20 years.
The workforce totals about 120,000. Until the Gulf war, almost half depended
on jobs in Israel - now their number is below 50,000 and may be as low as
30,000. Given unemployment of 30-40 per cent, this has knocked a hole in
Gaza's income and is set to worsen.
The mass unrest which dominated the first three years of the intifada, the
uprising against Israeli rule which erupted in 1987, faded to some extent -
but three other deadly trends have developed.
First, the Islamic fundamentalist group Hamas, a newly powerful force in the
strip, adopted the use of arms against the occupation. Like the Palestine
Liberation Organisation which it rivals, Hamas had eschewed the use of guns,
chiefly for fear of provoking an even tougher response from the Israelis and
losing the support of international public opinion.
Now its fighters frequently ambush troops and it backs attacks on individual
Israelis. 'Did public opinion liberate our land? Did public opinion restore
out rights?' asks Dr Zahar rhetorically.
Second, the army stepped up its use of undercover squads, which have shot
dead some 40 Palestinians in the past year.
Third, there was intensification of a trend of brutal killings by
Palestinians of compatriots accused of collaboration with Israel.
For the PLO, this has been a testing time. The Madrid peace conference of
last October, where Palestinians put their case with unprecedented force,
won considerable support in Gaza, home of Dr Haidar Abdel Shafi, head of the
Palestinian delegation.
Since then, though, the slow pace of the negotiations has put pressure on
the PLO to show results or lose further support to Hamas, which rejects the
peace process.
Mr Awad Mabhouh, a political activist and resident of Jabalya, says most
Gazans realised the PLO had little choice but to join the peace talks and
they supported them. But they also applaud the gunmen of Hamas for keeping
pressure on Israel.
He still believes that a Palestinian state will be created. A key question
in Gaza, where the vast majority of refugees came in 1948 from within what
is now Israel, is whether that state should be limited to the West Bank and
Gaza, as the PLO concedes, or include all the territory between the
Mediterranean and the Jordan River, as Hamas says.
Mr Mabhouh says his aged father, still holding the key to his house (long
since destroyed) near the Israeli city of Ashqelon, would never give up the
claim to return. But the son is more pragmatic: 'If the PLO says we should
settle for compensation, we will accept it instead of going back.'

FT  01 JUN 92 / Economic forecasts can endanger your wealth
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN WOLF
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF FORECASTERS cannot predict the future, should they have one? This is a
question that business people and ministers are bound to ask themselves.
True, forecasters have done well enough when economies perform in line with
their long-term trends. But so would simple extrapolation. Forecasting has
been breaking down whenever sharp changes come along, which is precisely
when accuracy is most needed.
Consider the recent performance of that doyen of forecasting institutions,
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. As late as June
1990, the OECD forecast US economic growth at 2.3 per cent in 1991 over
1990. This prediction was then cut in every subsequent forecast. Most
recently, the economy is estimated to have declined by 0.7 per cent.
For OECD Europe, the 1991 error was similar in nature to that for the US,
but not as large. Meanwhile, Japan's economy was better behaved than both
the US and the European in 1991, but is now making up for its past good
behaviour: the December 1990 forecast of 3.8 per cent for economic growth
between 1991 and 1992 has already drooped to 1.8 per cent. Further
reductions in the forecast are likely.
People who wagered their wealth on what the OECD was predicting two years
ago have a good chance of being bankrupt today. Not, it should be stressed,
that they would have done better by relying on other mainstream forecasters.
Like sheep, these have all gathered closer to one another than to the truth.
Forecasts published in the International Monetary Fund's World Economic
Outlook have been virtual twins of those from the OECD. The British Treasury
failed to forecast the boom in the UK economy between 1986-88, the recession
that started in late-1990 and its subsequent persistence. Many of those who
make their living in the City have followed closely on the Treasury's heels.
The Gulf war is one reason that many forecasts for 1991 went awry. But it is
only a part of the story. Despite 50 years of practice and huge increases in
computer power, the ability of economists to provide precise forecasts, even
for the near term, is very much in question.
One explanation for persistent failure is change in policy regimes. Capital
market liberalisation, for example, makes past behaviour almost irrelevant
to the future. Time might remedy this problem, though not if such changes
will themselves be a persistent feature of economic life.
There is a more fundamental worry. Forecasting assumes that people's
responses to past data will be repeated. Suppose, instead, that people's
expectations of the future are determined not by past economic data but by
far more complex visions of how the world functions. Behaviour then would
not repeat itself, because history does not.
In response to past forecasting failures, some economists are abandoning
economics - the favoured approach being use of a Bayesian
Vector-Autoregressive (BVAR) model. Professor Michael Artis of the
University of Manchester has followed several US economists in this
direction. The name is fancy; the reality less so. Under this approach the
computer simply looks for statistical relationships in the data.
Even if such methods were to work, however, they would be of no help to
policy-makers. They want to know what would happen if the rate of interest
were lowered, to take one example. Economists cannot abandon economics
completely.
What are the lessons? First, forecasters should recognise the imprecision of
what they do by putting explicit intervals around all their forecasts;
second, they should rely still more on judgment than they already do.
Anybody who remembered Irving Fisher's debt-deflation theory of the Great
Depression would have had a better understanding of the forces recently
driving the main economies than would the orthodox modellers. As with chess
at its highest levels, human intuition and experience can still rival the
power of the computer. They are likely to do so for a long time.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Green shoots of good intention from business: The boardroom
view of the Earth Summit

MOST prominent in the approach to the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro this
week has been the international business community, not environmental
groups.
Never have business people been so active in a UN conference.
Captains of industry from all over the world addressed packed meetings in
Rio last week. Such phrases as 'environmental responsibility' have tripped
off tongues.
Yet many of the chief executives present run the world's most polluting
industries, such as car and chemical manufacturing. Changes decided at the
UN summit will cost them, but they are not here to lobby against it. Rather,
they are vocal in calling for regulations.
Leading the green business offensive is Mr Stephan Schmidheiny, a Swiss
billionaire from the asbestos trade and now principal adviser on business
and industry to Mr Maurice Strong, conference secretary-general.
Mr Schmidheiny insists that industry is changing: 'Profit and ecology are
linked. We're convinced that, unless we change course, we'll ruin our
future. Soon it will be impossible to separate business excellence and
environmental concern.'
He runs the Business Council for Sustainable Development (BCSD), which
brings together heads of 48 leading corporations - such as Dow Chemical, Du
Pont, Royal Dutch Shell and Mitsubishi - to formulate industry's position
for the conference.
The outcome of 18 months of meetings is a report calling for new
partnerships of government and the private sector, and proposing payment for
the use of natural resources, technological co-operation between the global
north and south, and tougher rules on pollution so that the polluter pays.
While the US government remains hostile to environmental regulation, some of
the leading US business executives are in Rio calling for it.
Mr Frank Popoff, head of Dow Chemical, says: 'It's very much in our interest
to get regulation which will enhance business moves to sustainable
development.'
Sustainable development - that is the mantra of the new green
industrialists. Mr Jan-Olaf Willums, executive director of the International
Chamber of Commerce Office on Environment, defines it thus: 'Environment is
an asset. Sustainable development is about learning to develop and maintain
this asset so we live off the income, not the capital.'
However, Mr Richard Lapper, industry adviser for the World Wide Fund for
Nature, wonders: 'I don't know if any of them realise how sweeping the
changes must be. Industry is driven on a set of rules which tends to work
against the environment because it does not internalise environmental costs.
Sustainable development means completely rethinking this.'
Mr Kenny Bruno of Greenpeace is sceptical: 'By proclaiming environmentalism,
these companies are trying to avoid responsibility for the fact that their
products and practices have wreaked environmental havoc.'
But Mr Carl Hahn, head of Volkswagen, argues: 'We have concrete examples of
how we have reduced pollution. We should not be criticised because we too
want to live in a better environment.'
Mr Gabriele Cagliari, chairman of the Italian energy company ENI, admits
there is a profit motive at work: 'The market will punish those who do not
change.
'It is cheaper to produce non-polluting products than bear the costs of the
problems caused by polluting.'
The message is that what is good for the environment need not be bad for the
economy. There can even be benefits.
Mr Joseph Connor, head of the ICC, says: 'The corporate challenge is to take
advantage of green consumerism and opportunities such as waste recycling and
non-polluting products.'
The market for enviromental products in Europe to the end of this decade has
been estimated at Pounds 600bn.
But for industry to change profoundly, Mr Schmidheiny repeats, it needs
government incentives and penalties as carrots and sticks.
'The nations most successful in wielding these will be those whose
industries prosper,' he says.

CBS will charge affiliate stations to carry certain programmes, a plan which
would radically alter the way the US television network deals with its
affiliates, a New York newspaper reported yesterday, Reuter reports from New
York.
The network said the change was needed because of low profits and increased
competition from the Fox and cable networks and programme syndicators.

INDONESIA'S populist opposition party, campaigning against government

yesterday - the last campaign day in the capital before the June 9 election,
Reuter reports from Jakarta. This is the biggest street demonstration since
general election campaigning started three weeks ago.
'The biggest enemy is corruption not inflation,' leaders of the Indonesian
Democratic party (PDI) told a big crowd in Jakarta. They said police
reported that 3m PDI supporters had gone into the streets, dwarfing
Saturday's estimated 1m people campaigning for the ruling Golkar party.

<TEXT>
TENS of thousands of people yesterday staged an anti-war protest in
Belgrade, the Serbian capital yesterday. Mr Ivan Vejvoda, a Belgrade
sociologist, said: 'We are here with a message of great importance from
Belgrade to the people of Sarajevo: We are with you'. The Bosnian capital
has been under siege for the past two months.
The crowd of some 50,000, which included mothers and children, yesterday
demanded an end to the war. They marched through the city centre carrying a
black banner symbolising their grief over the killings and destruction in
Bosnia. Chanting 'Slobo, Saddam,' they showed their outrage at Serbian
President Slobodan Milosevic.
Many expressed shame about Serbia's role in the war. They carried signs
saying: 'God does not forgive the sin of murder' and 'In memoriam to those
killed in Bosnia', in contrast to the election banners of the ruling
Socialists which warned: 'We don't bargain with the dignity of our
fatherland' and 'We have faith in our citizens'.
Most of the marchers feared the UN sanctions were only a prelude to military
intervention. Mr Milan Nikolic, an opposition politician, said: 'Sanctions
are better than military intervention. But I am afraid this is a step
towards intervention. The main victims of the sanctions will be those
already against Milosevic. Scientists, actors, opposition leaders. Military
intervention would strengthen Milosevic, by homogenising Serbs in defence of
Serbia.'
Ms Sanja Sanader, a tourist agent, said: 'Sanctions will punish the average
person; It won't destroy those in power. They won't even feel it.' But
behind the pride that Belgrade has taken a stand against the violence,
loomed the belief that death and destruction will soon engulf Belgrade. 'In
the back of everyone's mind is fear the war might spread here,' one marcher
declared.

FT  01 JUN 92 / UN Sanctions Against Serbia: Moves to end trade and freeze
assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADING links between the Serbian-led remnant of Yugoslavia and the rest of
the world were severed yesterday, one day after the UN Security Council
imposed a package of comprehensive sanctions.
In Britain, the Treasury moved early today to block Serbian assets, saying
this would take effect from midnight last night. There may be some problems
as banks try to disentangle assets held by Serbia and its ally Montenegro,
the target of sanctions, and the other former Yugoslav states.
The trade ban in Britain meant some 50-60 UK companies which have acquired
export licences to supply goods to Serbia and Montenegro will be told today
these have been revoked. The government has to obtain an order in council
under the Emergency Powers Act letting the Bank of England issue notices to
the commercial banks freezing assets. Similar measures imposed when Iraq
invaded Kuwait were taken within 24 hours. Yugoslavia has been reducing
assets held overseas in expectation of sanctions; assets in the UK are now
thought to be less than Dollars 500m (Pounds 277.7m) against nearly Dollars
600m in June 1991.
The freeze would apply to assets held on behalf of government bodies, banks
and commercial organisations. It was not clear if this covered private
individuals' assets. Trade sanctions cover exports to and imports from
Serbia and Montenegro, and any activity meant to promote trade with those
countries. Goods already shipped and imports already in transit will be
allowed to complete their journeys.
Airline flights to and from those destinations are also barred under the UN
sanctions. In Belgrade the Tanjug news agency said Germany, Switzerland and
the Netherlands had enforced the ban. UK exports to Yugoslavia amounted to
Pounds 194m in 1991 against imports from that country of Pounds 148m. The
top five export categories included telecommunications equipment (Pounds
32m).

FT  01 JUN 92 / UN Sanctions Against Serbia: Penalties 'a devastating blow
to Serbian economy'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OFFICIALS and economists in Belgrade admitted yesterday, after maintaining
only last week that sanctions would have no effect on Serbia, that the UN's
comprehensive package could be a devastating blow to the economy.
'Some sectors of the economy will come to a complete standstill, and the
entire economy will be forced just to survive,' said Mr Bozo Jovanovic,
minister for foreign economic relations. 'Serbia would be reduced to
conditions of war.'
Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic held a closed session of the Serbian
Chamber of Commerce late last week, aimed at boosting the morale of the
business community, especially exporters. He brushed aside the threat of
sanctions, saying Serbia would receive oil and energy supplies from Angola.
But the total UN embargo on commodities and products means no country will
be allowed to sell or supply oil to Serbia; western analysts in Belgrade
believe the oil embargo is the most powerful weapon in the UN's armoury of
sanctions.
A report by Petroleum Intelligence Weekly late last year said Yugoslav oil
output was 79,500 barrels a day, representing only 25 per cent of demand.
Gas production was about 3bn cubic metres a year, or about 40 per cent of
demand. Western diplomats believe a run-down of oil reserves, the extent of
which are unknown, would affect the Serbian-backed Yugoslav army and the
entire industrial sector.
Industrial production in various sectors fell in the first quarter of this
year by 25-40 per cent, against the equivalent period last year. Exports of
Yugocars, Serbia's car-maker, are almost at a halt because of the war in
Bosnia-Hercegovina and the virtual collapse of trade relations. All three of
the former Yugoslavian republics provided car components, upholstery, white
goods and electronics to Serbia.
Diplomats and economists say sanctions may take some time to bite, but that
the Serbian leaders will have to continue to print money to pay the
workforce. This is likely to fuel inflation, now at about 100 per cent a
month. Economists say that, with prices almost doubling daily, inflation is
out of control. Lines of cars queued at many Belgrade petrol stations
yesterday, and people were stock-piling food.

FT  01 JUN 92 / UN Sanctions Against Serbia: Milosevic in a fight to save
his political life - Serbian militia forces would see any appeal by the
president to bring an end to the fighting as a betrayal of their cause
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SERBIAN president Slobodan Milosevic has been cornered by the international
community, led by the US.
The United Nations sanctions imposed on Saturday night against Serbia and
its ally Montenegro mean that Serbia is now being held responsible for the
fighting, destruction, mutilation and killings which have swept
Bosnia-Hercegovina and Croatia over the past year.
In the first real sign of desperation, Mr Milosevic appealed at the weekend
to US President George Bush and Russian President Boris Yeltsin to stop the
fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina. Although he said he would co-operate in
their efforts, he attacked sanctions, which unfairly singled out Serbia, he
said.
For the first time since he came to power in 1987, Mr Milosevic is battling
for his political life. The question now is whether he can survive. Not only
does he face, for the first time, the ire of the international community,
but Serbs, who for five years have staunchly defended his expansionist
policies, are not expected to come to his defence.
Serbia's many warlords - including Mr Vojislav Seselj, head of the
ultra-nationalist Serbian Radical Party, Mr Zeljko Raznatovic, known as
Arkan and head of a ruthless Serb paramilitary unit, and Mr Radovan
Karadzic, nationalist head of Bosnia's Serbs - are accusing Mr Milosevic of
being 'too soft' and 'too moderate'.
Serb militia forces, who already control large swathes of Bosnian territory,
would regard any appeal by Mr Milosevic to end the fighting as treasonable,
a betrayal of the Serbian cause. 'We will fight for Serbia. We will not give
up the struggle,' a defiant Arkan said in Belgrade.
On the other side, the anti-war demonstration in Belgrade yesterday may have
come too late to atone for the deaths of at least 10,000 people, and the
displacement of more than 1.5m.
Those who marched represented thousands of the liberal, powerless
middle-class which has been jolted at last out of its passive attitude to Mr
Milosevic by the horror of the war in Sarajevo.
The demonstration was confined to the Serbian capital.
By contrast, in parts of the Serbian and Montenegran countryside, millions
of people - but not the opposition parties or the ethnic Albanians of
Serbian-controlled Kosovo - turned out to vote in parliamentary elections
aimed at legitimising the new, rump Yugoslavia.
The capital and other large cities do not represent a nation-wide consensus.
The gap between the cities and the conservative countryside is wide. Mr
Milosevic, and particularly the nationalists, are likely to exploit it in
their quest for a greater Serbia.
This sharp polarisation within Serbia means that sanctions are unlikely to
stop the war in neighbouring Bosnia - nor will sanctions necessarily prevent
Serbia being engulfed in a civil war engineered by fanatical nationalist
Serb groups which have not only been radicalised by the war, but are more
fervent than Mr Milosevic.
Against this background, his conciliatory appeal for co-operation from the
international community at the weekend has come too late. This is because he
has consistently failed to identify Serbia and the Yugoslav army as the
aggressor in the war in Croatia and Bosnia-Hercegovina. Yet, when it suited
him, particularly under international pressure, Mr Milosevic reined in some
radical Serbs, such as Mr Milan Babic, head of the self-proclaimed Serbian
republic of Croatia.
Because of Mr Milosevic's unpredictable nature, a senior western diplomat
warned: 'You cannot yet write off Milosevic - nor can you be sure that
sanctions will put an end to the fighting in Bosnia'.
The war in Bosnia-Hercegovina is also likely to continue because the
fighting there has traumatised and radicalised the Croat, Serb and Moslem
communities, all of which are seeking revenge.
In Hercegovina, where there is a heavy concentration of Croats,
ultra-nationalist Croatian units, partly supported by Croatia (while others
are acting independently), are still fighting to attach Hercegovina to
Croatia.
In other parts of Bosnia, Moslem militiamen, incensed by the killings, are
determined to continue fighting.
They are no longer convinced that any peace conference or sanctions will
stop Serbian paramilitary units - led by Mr Karadzic, Mr Raznatovic, or
General Ratko Mladic, commander of the Serb army in Bosnia - creating
ethnically-pure regions in Bosnia.
US and UN officials in Belgrade are suggesting that, if the sanctions fail,
the use of force will be actively considered.
This could involve securing Sarajevo airport, held by Serb militia and the
federal army, so as to allow food, medicine and humanitarian supplies into
the city.
This speculation has been fuelled by the response from some Serb quarters to
the threat of sanctions. Arkan said last week: 'I don't give a damn about
sanctions. We do not need democracy in Serbia. We only need to be united. We
will fight for united Serbian lands. This is war. . .'

ONE immediate psychological blow to Serbia of UN sanctions was the
international sports ban, Our Foreign Staff reports from Belgrade and
London. 'Banning the Yugoslav football and basketball teams makes the
average guy think,' said a sports official in Belgrade, as he awaited last
night's confirmation of the suspension by the international football
association (Fifa). 'It is a crushing blow to the man in the street.'
The ban prohibits the Yugoslavian team, reckoned among the world's best,
taking part in the European championship finals starting in Sweden on June
10. The team will be replaced by Denmark. The International Olympic
Committee (IOC) meets next week to discuss whether to exclude Yugoslavia
from this summer's Barcelona Games.
The International Tennis Federation banned Yugoslavia from the Davis Cup and
similar competitions. Mr Juan Samaranch, IOC president, said his executive
commission would meet in Lausanne to analyse the UN resolution.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE, one of the last bastions of heavy smoking in Europe, is introducing
tough restrictions on smoking in public places including trains, aircraft
and restaurants.
Under the restrictions published this weekend, which come into force on
November 1, people will be allowed to smoke only in specially designated
areas in public places such as restaurants, businesses, educational
institutions, leisure centres and transport vehicles.
If restaurants and leisure centres wish to allow customers to smoke they
must provide special areas. Employers will also have to provide special
zones. They will be given six months to consult with their companies'
medical advisers and hygiene committees to decide how to reorganise offices,
production floors and communal areas to accommodate smokers.
Stiffer restrictions will be applied to public transport. The proportion of
smoking seats on French trains will be reduced to 30 per cent.
Smoking will be banned completely from buffet cars on trains, in metro
stations and on all internal flights of less than two hours.
Children under 16 will no longer be allowed to smoke in French schools and
colleges.
These restrictions reflect the general trend towards anti-smoking
regulations across the European Community. However the French rules will be
among the toughest in the EC.
They reflect the French government's concern about the health hazards of
smoking, said to be the direct cause of 54,000 deaths a year in France.
Roughly 40 per cent of the French population now smoke, a far higher
proportion than in most other EC countries.
From November 1, anyone flouting the new laws will be punishable by fines of
FFr300 to FFr600. Fines of FFr1,200 to FFr3,000 will be payable by
restaurants and leisure centres.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Denmark sees surge in Maastricht support
</HEADLINE>

   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DENMARK appears likely to back the Maastricht treaty on European union by a
comfortable majority when it votes tomorrow in the country's binding
referendum on the subject.
All the opinion polls published at the weekend suggest there has been a
surge in support of voting Yes to Maastricht. What had looked in the middle
of last week to be a tight result appears to be turning into an easy victory
for the pro-union forces.
A Gallup poll yesterday showed 44 per cent in favour, 35 against and 13 per
cent not knowing. However, among those who had decided to vote, 56 per cent
said they were in favour of the Maastricht treaty and 44 per cent against. A
survey by the Sonar organisation showed 49 per cent for and 40 per cent
against.
Mr Poul Schluter, Denmark's prime minister, said he was confident that up to
60 per cent would back the treaty after a very large voter turn-out. If the
opinion polls prove accurate, the rest of the European Community will be
relieved that the Danish referendum did not lead to a constitutional crisis
for the EC.
Observers believe the main cause of the rapid rise in the Yes vote stems
from the sustained effort (after a late start) by the Danish labour movement
in campaigning for the Maastricht treaty.
Both the opposition Social Democrats and the trade unions have warned their
supporters not to vote No because that would threaten up to 150,000 jobs,
jeopardise Denmark's Dkr40bn (Pounds 3.5bn) exports to the EC and undermine
the economy.
Against this bombardment the anti-Maastricht coalition - made up of
environmentalists, women's groups, far-left parties and ultra-nationalists -
has found it difficult to respond effectively. Many Danish women remain
fearful, however, that a more integrated Europe will become less socially
responsive.
For all the doubts and worries, though, most Danes seem to recognise that
their prosperity is closely dependent on their country's integration to the
EC's single market. With large balance of payments and trade surpluses, low
inflation and the highest per capita industrial production in the EC,
Denmark already fulfils all the stringent conditions laid down for the
transition to the final stage of European monetary union.
However, the Danes remain awkward Europeans and Mr Schluter was keen to play
down yesterday any suggestion that a Yes vote tomorrow would mean a Danish
endorsement for a federal EC.
'There will never be a united states of Europe,' he asserted. 'The
federalists have lost the battle.' The prime minister added that, while
Denmark would certainly give up some of its 'formal' sovereignty, it would
gain 'real' sovereignty by being one of the EC decision-makers, with the
larger European states.

<TEXT>
WARRING FACTIONS in the besieged Bosnian capital of Sarajevo agreed to a
ceasefire yesterday, in response to the sweeping sanctions imposed on Serbia
and Montenegro by the United Nations on Saturday.
The ceasefire news came after 50,000 demonstrators marched through Belgrade
to protest against the war in Bosnia and to show support for those trapped
in Sarajevo.
Yugoslav federal troops and Serb irregulars had continued to bombard
Sarajevo and the Croatian Adriatic city of Dubrovnik despite the sanctions.
The latter suffered nine hours of heavy shelling yesterday before a UN
ceasefire took effect.
The UN Security Council voted on Saturday to isolate Serbia and Montenegro,
which comprise Yugoslavia's rump federation, through a trade ban including
an oil embargo.
The sanctions resolution also cuts all air links, freezes Serbia's financial
assets overseas, calls for a reduction in the size of its diplomatic
missions and bars Yugoslav representatives from sports events and cultural
exchanges.
In London, the Trade and Industry Department said some export licences,
granted to 50-60 UK companies to supply goods to Serbia and Montenegro, were
revoked. Trading links with the Serbian-led remnant of Yugoslavia were
severed at 11.30 am yesterday. The Treasury said it had taken action to
block Serbian assets from midnight last night.
The International Football Federation (FIFA) said it was disqualifying
Yugoslavia from international football competition, including the European
nations championship finals this month in Sweden. The International Olympic
Committee is to meet next week to decide whether Yugoslavia may take part in
the Barcelona games this summer.
Serb leaders from the ruling Socialist party condemned the sanctions as 'an
aggression against the legal, economic and political order'. President
Slobodan Milosevic said defiantly that Serbia was 'paying the price for
protecting its fellow Serbs'.
Mr Vladislav Jovanovic, foreign minister, told Belgrade Radio: 'We will make
efforts to make the whole world, especially the Security Council, get the
full picture about our attempts to stop the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
'The cloud which will come over us will disappear. Serbia will do everything
to solve the existing problems in a satisfactory way and as quickly as
possible,' he added.
UN and Bosnian officials said Serb and Moslem-Croat forces in Sarajevo
accepted a ceasefire to start at 6pm (1600 GMT) today.
Mr Mile Akmadzic, secretary-general in Bosnia's collective Moslem-Croat
presidency, told a televised news conference the pact had been brokered by
Colonel John Wilson, a UN peace-keeping officer in Sarajevo.
'We will also start urgent negotiations with the federal army and (UN
peace-keepers) to reopen Sarajevo airport and an air corridor over Bosnia,'
Mr Akmadzic added, without elaboration.
The ceasefire could represent the start of a long and difficult process
aimed at sending food, medical and humanitarian supplies into the city.
Humanitarian agencies have been unable to penetrate a Serb blockade of
Sarajevo for weeks. Mass hunger and sickness are reported in the city of
500,000 people.
The renewed barrages against Sarajevo and Dubrovnik had suggested some Serb
militia and Yugoslav army troops were beyond political control.
Ms Zana Misovic, a Radio Sarajevo journalist contacted by telephone, said
the local militia forces were out of control, and that fighting continued in
Dobrinja, a suburb of Sarajevo.
'We welcome the sanctions against Serbia, but they are too late. We are
afraid that the ceasefire will allow the Serb militia to regroup,' she said.
She felt only military intervention could save the city from destruction.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Canary Wharf job moves mooted before collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY and JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT held talks with three developers, including Olympia &amp; York,
on terms for a substantial shift of civil servants to London's Docklands
even before O&amp;Y's Canary Wharf went into administration last week, it
emerged yesterday.
Consideration of moving a large number of civil servants before the collapse
indicates the government's long-standing concern about the loss of momentum
in the development of Docklands.
The relocation of up to 5,000 government workers from several departments
will top the agenda when senior ministers meet in Downing Street today under
the chairmanship of Lord Wakeham, leader of the Lords.
Officials continue to insist there will be no bail-out of Canary Wharf but
one minister confirmed that the aim was to give a firm vote of confidence in
the area. The government also intends to maximise its leverage in
negotiating preferential rents by offering to take substantial quantities of
space.
Some senior civil servants are even urging the examination of the option of
buying freeholds from distressed Docklands property companies, arguing that
the crisis has produced a 'once-in-50 years' opportunity to buy quality
property at knock-down prices.
Furthermore, reports that the government is taking a tough stance on the
obligation of any private investor to honour O&amp;Y's commitment to put Pounds
400m towards the proposed Jubilee Underground line extension were being
qualified yesterday.
The initial requirement is for Pounds 100m, payable in three tranches over a
number of years, and the rest over the long term using a formula based on
rent income. The Pounds 800m improvement to the Docklands Light Railway, the
east-west road link and the upgrading of the A13 would be more than adequate
for the area in the short to medium term.
Civil servants who could be involved in the move include 2,000 from the
Environment Department, up to 1,000 from Transport, and several hundred from
Trade and Industry, including the Radio Agency. Pressure is also being
exerted on the new Department of National Heritage.
Details of the behind-the-scenes discussions emerged as Hanson, the
acquisitive industrial conglomerate, and P&amp;O, the transport company,
confirmed their interest in the future of the multi-billion pound
development. At the same time, Labour stepped up demands for an emergency
Commons statement on the future of Canary Wharf that went into
administration owing banks Pounds 1.2bn.
Hanson confirmed its interest in buying property on Canary Wharf, although
it was stressed that this was still at an early stage. It remains unclear
how the property would fit into the company's portfolio. Mr Martin Taylor,
Hanson's vice-president, said: 'We think this is an interesting opportunity
and wish to look further.'
Hanson does not have extensive interests in property development but Mr
Taylor said the company did have a significant property portfolio and had
some properties surplus to requirements from previous purchases. He added:
'Most of the things that we've done have been different from what we've done
before.'
P&amp;O was also watching the situation, but seemed unlikely to put money in to
Canary Wharf.

   RIO, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANY of the world's wealthier nations have expressed doubts about one of the
two main documents to be signed at the Earth Summit, just two days before
the gathering is due to begin.
President George Bush's announcement on Friday night that the US would not
sign the biological diversity treaty - an international treaty to preserve
species - has been followed by objections from other states.
The disagreement has cast a shadow over preparations for an event whose aims
have already been reduced by compromise. Although the US does not think it
can stop the signing of the biological diversity treaty in Rio de Janeiro,
it apparently hopes that other nations, including Japan and some European
Community members, will now be persuaded to take a second look at it.
The EC delegation met to assess its position. There was some anger that the
US had pulled out so late. Mr David Maclean, the UK environment minister,
said yesterday the UK was worried about the treaty's financial aspects and
had asked its lawyers to study the text.
The concern has prompted 19 industrialised countries to sign a declaration
which lays out their reading of a potentially ambiguous clause in the
treaty, which they fear could amount to signing a blank cheque. The draft of
the treaty says the amount of money rich nations will give to poorer ones to
preserve species would be determined by all participating countries.
This means that the donor nations could be out-voted by the recipients, and
forced to hand over large sums of money. This is particularly sensitive
given that the richer countries are resisting the notion that the Earth
Summit is mainly about environmental aid for the Third World.
But there are wider worries. The treaty defines the right of countries to
exploit their species for commercial purposes, such as making medicines out
of plants. Industrial countries fear that this would undermine
pharmaceutical patent rights.
The bio-diversity treaty is one of only two now left for the summit to
approve. The other is on climate change.
In Washington, meanwhile, the White House sought to take the sting out of
environmentalists' criticism of the US stance. Mr William Reilly,
administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, said President Bush
would today announce a US contribution of more than Dollars 100m (Pounds
56m) a year for a new plan to preserve the world's forests.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (10): A national diet of movies and soccer -
Private tv takes on the public networks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FROM A computer terminal at his secretary's desk, Juan Cueto is able to
watch one of his fantasies slowly become real. He runs Canal Plus, Spain's
only pay-TV channel, and the screen he watches gives him a real time count
of the number of people subscribing.
The formula is simple. 'Spaniards only queue for two things,' he says.
'Movies and football.' And that is what they get on Canal Plus. By the end
of this year, he says, Canal Plus will have won half a million subscribers
and start making profits.
It is just two years since Spain licensed three new private television
channels and, if one believes their managers, they are all very close to
making money.
One, Tele Cinco - controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, the Catalan financier
Javier de la Rosa and the Spanish charity for the blind, ONCE  - already
challenges the big state-owned networks with a brash mix of game shows,
films and an increasingly good news service.
As a pay channel, Canal Plus is an outsider. Owned by Canal Plus of France
and the publishers of Spain's biggest newspaper, El Pais, it is more easily
managed and its finances more clearly definable.
The third new channel, Antenna 3, is generally reckoned to be the most
vulnerable financially. Concentrating on a more journalistic talk show
format has limited audiences but, says its managing director, Mr Manuel
Martin Ferrand, the channel will make about Dollars 4m this year. Antenna 3
is controlled mainly by the Godo family, which owns Barcelona's biggest
newspaper, La Vanguardia, and its future has been boosted recently by the
arrival of of rich and powerful new shareholder, Banesto, one of the
country's big five commercial banks.
At the moment, signals from these new channels reach about 80 per cent of
Spain's television audience and this will rise to 90 per cent by the end of
1993. But there, possibly, the good news may end.
Both Tele Cinco and Antenna 3 face a huge hurdle in the form of the State
for before granting private sector licences Madrid set in motion one of
Europe's most ambitious and expensive public television expansion
programmes.
This involved allowing the country's 17 autonomous regions to create their
own television channels which, like the two big national state-owned
channels TVE1 and TVE2, would finance themselves through advertising.
That might have been less noteworthy during the 1986 to 1989 boom when
advertising was growing sharply, but total TV advertising revenues grew just
Dollars 30m to Dollars 1.96bn between 1990 and last year.
Television swallows up about 33 per cent of advertising spending in Spain
and the State, in addition to being the biggest TV advertiser, is also its
biggest consumer.
Television channels captive to the parties that rule in the regions have
been established in Catalonia (which has two), Andalucia, the Basque
Country, Galicia, Valencia and Madrid.
Collectively, they form one of the biggest drains on the Spanish public
purse and last year were paid direct subsidies by their local governments of
Dollars 500m. On each channel, the biggest advertiser was also the local
government, which might be counted as a hidden subsidy. By some independent
reckonings, these channels may be being subsidised by close to Dollars 1bn a
year.
The regional channels took 15 per cent of the Spanish television advertising
cake last year in what all of the new private channels (including, from a
political point of view, Canal Plus which carries no advertising) privately
lament as an insurmountable barrier.
It is quite likely that more regional channels will emerge as regional
political leaders succumb to the lure of controlling such a powerful means
of communication. Subsidies to the channels have grown so fast that even the
OECD made an oblique criticism of them them in its last report on the
Spanish economy.
But, for the private channels, the nightmare does not stop there. TVE1 and
TVE2 take a full 56 per cent of the TV advertising market. Together, these
channels, the oldest in Spain, give new meaning to the now discredited idea
that commercial television is a licence to print money.
They lost more than Dollars 400m last year and recently announced that
between 1992 and 1995 they would lose another Dollars 1.7bn.
This year or next, for the first time, TVE may go to the markets to raise up
to Dollars 300m to finance itself but they are too valuble a political tool
of whatever Government runs the country to be allowed to wither. Private
channels privately accuse the public operations of fierce price cutting,
meanwhile. In fact, if official tariffs had been applied, TV advertising in
Spain would have risen 26 per cent last year.
'We can live with this competition from the State but we cannot progress
much,' says Mr Martin Ferrand at Antenna 3. Fortunately for him the Godo
family's newspaper and radio operations make negotiating with agencies
easier.
Spain, meanwhile, has still not implemented the European Community
broadcasting directive limiting advertising during films - which always
attract the highest audiences in Spain - to just one break every 45 minutes.
When it does, something - private, regional or national - will have to give.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (9): Ascent to Europe gets tougher - Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALONG with most of its European Community partners, Spain has prepared a
plan ahead of the Lisbon summit at the end of the Portuguese presidency
showing how it proposes to converge its economy towards the targets set by
EC heads of Government in Maastricht last December.
Unlike the rest of its partners, Spain is making a very big deal of its
convergence plan.
To the finance ministry, finally given the freedom by Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez to deliver some well-aimed hammer blows at an inflationary service
sector, the plan is a once in a lifetime opportunity. To the unions, it has
rapidly become the sum of all fears.
This is largely because the Finance Minister, Mr Carlos Solchaga, has
refused to confine the plan merely to meeting the Maastricht targets.
Rather, the essence of his plan is not nominal, but what he calls real,
convergence entailing, in other words, measures Spain would have to take in
order to compete in an open market even if the EC did not exist.
These measures come at the end of a 46 page outline plan published in April
and, naturally for a ministry which knows it is about to stir up a hornets'
nest, some of the writing is vague.
It is, however, easy to cut through the fog.
'Reinforcing the job-seeking process', says the most important heading. This
quickly boiled down to two points. First, Mr Solchaga was going to cut back
on unemployment benefits and, second, double the amount of time required in
work in order to qualify for the reduced benefit.
In addition, an unemployed worker receiving benefit would have to take the
first job on offer or have the benefit stopped.
For a socialist government even to contemplate such an attack on one of the
citadels of the welfare state has flabbergasted the unions, who are now
threatening fierce retaliation.
Mr Solchaga's response is simple. The unions were offered an opportunity to
sign a three year wages pact last year and refused. And Spain's 16.3 per
cent rate of unemployment is a sham and everyone knows it. At least a third
of the unemployed work in the black economy and the system of paying
incentives to industry to create jobs is being terribly abused.
'Economic deregulation measures', says the next sub heading. The text
blandly adds that 'a good number of sectors which in the recent past have
been inflationary have justified this by pointing to the existence of a
collection of regulations and rules ..which have erected entry barriers and
the proliferation of agreements which tend to divide up the market, to fix
prices and to limit output, distribution and investment.
Blood will flow here. Practically anyone who has a degree in Spain belongs
to one kind or another of colegio which both protects their professional
standing and limits their competitiveness. Thus, an architect living in
Madrid and registered with the Madrid colegio will not be undercut on price
by his fellows but he or she will not be able to bid for work outside of
Madrid.
Pharmacists in Spain have one of Europe's most jealously guarded monopolies.
The colegios are powerful lobbies and are bound to resist any attempts to
strip them of the regulations that allow them to exist.
Nevertheless, Mr Solchaga has instructed a newly erected court at the
industry ministry, the Tribunal for the Defence of Competition to spend this
year pinpointing monopoly or restrictive practices among the professions and
to report back in the final three months with recommendations about how to
break them and, also, who should do it.
Under 'Liberalisation Measures' Mr Solchaga tacitly conceded that reforming
the professions might take time. But, the plan insists, there are 'some
sectors in which reform cannot wait'. Most of these tend to be transport or
communications of some sort over which the European Community has already
agreed liberalising directives but which Spain has been late in implementing
 -to Mr Solchaga's irritation. The most important, though, is the rapid
dismantling of Telefonica's telecoms monopolies wherever they exist and the
Government is about to grant new mobile operating licences to private
bidders.
'Credit and insurance entities' announces the next heading.
Although Spain's financial markets have been greatly streamlined and
liberalised in the past few years, 'the priority now is to accelerate the
transfer of the benefits of this greater economic freedom and competition to
the customer'. Anyone who has had to wait three weeks for a Spanish bank to
move an international cash transfer from its foreign department to a usable
current account will know what this is about. The government also plans to
draft new laws forcing insurers to do away with small print clauses which
often impose absurd conditions on possible claimants.
'Public companies' is a bland enough introduction to another nightmare for
the unions for under it Mr Solchaga announces a freeze, at current levels,
of subsidies to the huge state industrial sector.
'This restriction will oblige these companies to substantially improve their
management and, if this is not enough, to rescale their operations or,
alternatively, raise capital in the debt markets or sell assets.'
This is tough. Renfe, the state railway monopoly, lost more than Dollars 2bn
last year. year. Iberia, the airline, has only made money once in the last
five years. Any 'rescaling' of operations - job cuts - could invite union
response throughout the state sector.
'Health'. The health service is the public sector's fastest growing loss
maker, as the nation's 17 autonomous regions develop their own health care
systems. Mr Solchaga, as in the case of the unemployment cutbacks, is able
to instruct most spending ministries on what to do with the money he gives
them. He has therefore forced a sweeping managerial shakeup in health care.
'The government considers it necessary to transform the current
administrative model into a model of management services in which it is
possible to identify the link between the quality of service and its cost.'
Thus state hospitals will soon become individually managed and responsible
for their own budgets.
Obviously, hospitals will begin to look beyond Insalud, the central supplier
of goods and services to hospitals, for competitors.
None of this has anything to do with Maastricht, but the Finance Ministry is
adamant that the 'real' convergence implied in the measures outlined at the
back of its plan is the only way to guarantee that once Spain enters
economic and monetary union, it can stay there.
Officials say the nominal convergence detailed in the plan is of minor
importance, though this is probably bravado.
Fortunately, Spain has until the beginning of 1997 (the earliest date set
for EMU) to bring its macroeconomic house into order. This is easily
achievable even though, as officials admit, the plan sets out to deflate the
economy while making it grow at least 1 per cent above the EC average every
year for the next five.
The targets are nevertheless impressive. Total public debt will fall from
4.4 per cent of GDP now to 1 per cent by the end of 1996. The economy will
grow 3 per cent this year (a wildly optimistic projection, many economists
suggest) and still be growing 3.5 per cent by the beginning of 1997. Unit
labour costs will be growing at 2.3 per cent by the end of 1996 compared
with 6.3 per cent at the end of last year and the deficit in the current
account of the balance of payments will have fallen from nearly 3 per cent
of GDP last year to 2.3 per cent.
Scepticism about these figures is met with an indulgent smile at the
ministry. As long as Spain grows more than the EC average, everything will
be fine, comes the answer. If the five years since Spain joined the EC are
any guide, then this is feasible, but the boom generated by adhesion is
over.
Clearly, then, the Spanish are banking on their ability to hold their EC
partners to a promise, made at Maastricht, to create a cohesion fund to
increase financing to poorer Community members who demonstrate that they are
making a determined effort to wring inefficiencies out of their economies.
The 'real' convergence proposals are designed to show Madrid's partners that
it is doing just that and that it is not simply coming to the table to beg
for more.
But the Spanish have become alarmed at the reluctance of the Germans even to
discuss implementing the Maastricht Treaty protocol dealing with cohesion.
And even worse, the Portuguese presidency of the community for the first
half of 1992 has refused to call a special meeting of EC leaders to discuss
it. Spain had been hoping that Portugal, as a fellow poor southern member,
would be interested in cohesion.
It seems, though, that as direct flows of EC funds account for about 5 per
cent of Portugal's GDP (and less than 1 per cent of Spain's), Lisbon is not
going to tamper too much with the current system. Worse, for Spain, is that
Britain takes over the presidency from Portugal for the rest of the year and
London is also highly unlikely to have cohesion near the top of its agenda.
But without the cohesion money Spain hoped would be forthcoming, its
convergence plan begins to look extremely ambitious and Prime Minister
Felipe Gonzalez is going to have to use all the charm he can muster to
squeeze it out of his European community friends.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (7): Homage to Catalonia - Barcelona awaits
the Games
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD not be the Olympic Games without a last minute panic and
Barcelona's panic has, not surprisingly, been about accommodation. In spite
of spending some Dollars 1.5bn on creating housing for athletes, umpires and
the media for this summer's Games, the sudden creation of new nations in
Eastern Europe and the re-entry to the Olympics of South Africa has sent
officials scurrying for available apartments and hotels.
There will not be many, even though many locals will probably leave town for
the duration of the Games to watch them from some cool Balearic island on
the television. When they come back, though, what a treat awaits them.
The build-up to the Games will have seen some Dollars 8.5bn of public and
private capital pumped in to Barcelona. The city, already an impressive
architectural monument to the modernist genius of its early 20th century
fathers, has become arguably the most modern city on the Mediterranean. Just
for a start, a Dollars 2bn new beltway system will probably take about 20
per cent of traffic off Barcelona's choking streets and help ease the city's
most chronic problem.
But, says Enric Truno, the city councillor who has prepared the Catalan
capital for the Games, they mean much more than revitalising a sagging
infrastructure. 'We want these Games to be different,' he says. 'We want
them to show not just that we are hospitable and warm but also to break the
notion that we are chaotic and lazy.'
Rather like Seville and its Expo '92 further south, Barcelona and Catalonia
have approached the Games as a unique opportunity to show themselves off to
visitors and particularly visitors who might one day become investors. The
region may be Spain's most economically robust but it is being challenged
for that leadership by Madrid and sees the Dollars 10bn pumped in to
Andalucia and Seville for the Expo as a threat.
Catalonia and Barcelona are to Spain what Baden-Wurttemburg and Stuttgart
are to Germany - places were things, including the people, work best of all.
Even in early April, guides were telling visitors to the Olympic city that
everything was practically ready for the Games while in Seville, the Expo
was forced to open with half a dozen of its pavilions still under
construction and access to the site still partly blocked by construction.
The Catalans will move heaven and earth not to be cast in the same mould
when the 11,000 journalists and media technicians begin to pour into
Barcelona in July.
They will probably get it right, but one wonders what Barcelona will be like
after the Games are over. It is a strange city, desperately trying to live
its life away from embarrassing, crude, Spain. It has become precious and
sort of untouchable, like an exhibit.
Its citizens clamber to speak Catalan to each other, using up mental
capacity on a language no-one else will ever bother to learn but which is
not quite obscure enough (like Basque) to guarantee the exoticism Catalonia
so craves.
A city famous for its artists and architects has decided once again that it
should be the design centre of Spain but has never made the link between
form and function central to all good design and which the modernists were
true to.
Nowadays everything, from paper cups to public walkways, is designed and
overdesigned. It would be nice if something spontaneous or ordinary
happened.
The Olympics will, no doubt, test Barcelona's capacity to improvise. The
city tried unsuccessfully to host Olympics in 1924, 1936 and 1972 and now
the new hotels, oversized airport, beltways, subways and railway stations
the Games have brought are bound to increase the city's confidence. They may
even calm the twitch that drives Barcelona to try constantly to be
different.
One thing will definitely help Barcelona to mellow. After decades of trying
to pretend it was nowhere near the Mediterranean by building factories
between the centre of town and the water, the Olympics have given the city
back its beach, about five kilometres of it just in front of the Dollars 1bn
Olympic village and its flashy new marina.
When the locals come back to town after the Games, the beach is where they
will probably go. It will be hot then and probably a good time to switch off
Gaudi and Dali and Picasso and get in some serious tanning.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (8): Start at El Aeropuerto - A no-nonsense
A-Z guide for the businessperson in Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUSINESS GUIDES, especially to Latin countries, tend to be frivolous affairs
full of advice about how to mix business with pleasure. Spain, though, is a
serious place so here are some utterly unfrivolous tips for the visiting or
newly resident executive:
Aeropuerto. Madrid's is, unfortunately, unavoidable. The most most exciting
thing in it is the local chamber of commerce bookshop. Some local flights
only land at the international terminal, making finding your car very
tricky. Barcelona and Seville, thanks to 1992, have new aeropuertos but they
are so big that from 1993 onwards will probably be three-quarters cordoned
off.
La Banca and Barcelona. The banks in Spain look modern but aren't. They take
days (sometimes weeks) to transfer your money, charge you for cashing
cheques if the branch isn't yours (even if it's the same bank) and will
almost never put the customer first. Avoid them if possible. As for
Barcelona, it has pretty buildings and prickly people - and is losing out in
business importance to Madrid.
Conductores y la corrupcion. That is drivers and corruption to you. Watch
out for both. Spaniards kill themselves at an amazing rate in cars and then
blame the Government for building bad roads. Actually, they just drive like
hooligans. Flying is safer and Iberia is a terrific airline. Corruption is
serious although the central administration is probably straight. Locally,
it gets bad. Discotecas y la droga. Discos and drugs. Possession of any drug
is legal. If you have children, they'll be seeing a lot of both. Also,
Spaniards love noise and love discos. Most discos have children's hours,
when 12 year olds can get their noise fixes without getting drunk. Then they
fill up with the auditors and merchant bankers in charge of your Dollars 10m
investment.  Ehpana and Eppo 92. Since the country is run by Andalucians it
has become fashionable to speak with a southern accent. So drop your S's and
X's, learn to enjoy dry sherry (manzanilla for the very deserving),
cigarettes and bullfighting. Being churlish about bullfighting will make you
no friends. Francia. If you represent a French state company, the Spanish
authorities would like to thank you for your interest in their state owned
wool/artificial limb/briefcase handle/propeller/ceramic lampshade enterprise
but are very sorry. No. You own a great deal of Spain already and you make
the Industry Ministry very nervous.
Gonzalez, Felipe. Despite trying very hard to get himself sacked lately,
Spaniards have decided to punish him for being so conservative by making him
prime minister for another 10 years.
Hotels. Spaniards are great waiters but all the good ones work in
restaurants. The rest go to hotels. Accommodation generally average. Stars
awarded for facilities, not service. Good double in the Palace or Ritz in
Madrid costs about Dollars 500 a night. Inflation? Stay in the hotel you
stayed in last year.
Jabugo cured ham. This is what your Spanish hosts will ply you with to break
down your resistance to the outrageous amount of money they want for their
pickle factory. It always works. One plate of this stuff will make you want
to live near a supply forever. F Gonzalez sends a monthly supply to an H
Kohl in Germany.
Kiosks. Nagel's encyclopaedia guide to Spain doesn't have a 'K' entry but
then it isn't sold in kiosks along with your newspaper, tobacco, bus tickets
and pools. Kiosks are a great idea but they're always closed when you need
one.
Lunch (Almuerzo): 2.30pm to 5.30pm at least. Best avoided if you've got work
to do. Aperitif with snacks, wine, starter, wine, main course, 'more wine?',
sweets, coffee, liquors. All laced with swirls of cigar and cigarette smoke.
You leave the restaurant and reel like Dracula as the sun (surprisingly
still there) blinds you and, on average, in Madrid, about Dollars 110 poorer
for two.
Madrid. A great place to do business if you've got a good local lawyer.
Mostly very clean, well run, keen to please. Try to get your work done in
the mornings. Post-lunch comprehension close to zero. Claims to be Cultural
Capital of Europe this year but many museums and monuments still boarded up
for renovation. Newspapers. If you read Spanish stick to El Pais and La
Vanguardia (Barcelona) for good general, international and business news.
Expansion for corporate news and Cinco Dias for whatever the Finance
Ministry is thinking. La Gaceta sometimes surprisingly fast with business
news. The rest of the nationals are axe-grinders. On most days the FT is in
Madrid kiosks at 8.30am.
Obsequio. Gifts. Pay close attention to this. Spanish companies give lots of
these to business journalists, most of which are unfortunately too valuable
to give back. Mainly wine and watches and fax machines and wine and CD
players and wine. Government officials have come to expect a little more
from business. Post nothing] Franco made every letter posted in Spain pass
through Madrid where he could read it. Things have not changed much. The
postal service is reckoned to have a running backlog of about 5m items at
any one time. Use a messenger service but don't let the blighters use your
phone when they arrive. That's to get the next job and it means your message
just got delayed.
'Que?' (Huh? What?) is something you'll be hearing and saying a lot as you
and your local business partners talk past each other. Don't bother with
pardon me and all that. A straight 'What' is fine. Spaniards speak
Castillian far too quickly. Latin Americans take their time, which may
explain why they produce the best Spanish literature.
Riqueza (wealth). It's hard to tell who has money and who doesn't in Madrid.
Husbands will forego family medical insurance for a Rolex. Wives have to
have a fur. But few rich Spaniards drive lousy cars. Sevilla. Expo 92 there
this year so not much work is being done. Spaniards like to think they like
Seville but mostly they're scared of its cliquiness. The British are
acceptable because the local aristocracy likes to show off in English
learned from nannies. Very hot, quite good fun but, ultimately, provincial.
Theatre. There is some very good opera and traditional performance theatre
in Madrid and Barcelona. One Problem: you can't go. Tickets are hard to get
unless you queue at the right window for the half an hour on whatever
afternoon they are on sale. Good concert seats always go to friends and
family of the official body sponsoring it. A good hotel can fix most things,
though. Understanding. Make sure you understand what is being said to you.
This is not London or New York. It isn't even Milan. 'Yes, we must do
business,' at the end of the meeting does not mean the deal is done. It
means, er .. who knows what it means. Keep that lawyer close by.
Vino. Totally undiscovered by the battalions of FT wine writers but thriving
nonetheless, Spanish wines are as rich and rough and subtle as anyone could
ever want them to be. Hardly any good ones get exported. 'W': Seven entries
in my dictionary. One of them is Windsurfista (windsurfer). But Spanish is
anglicising very slowly. There's faxear (to send a fax) and chequear (to
check up on) and zigzaguear (to zigzag) but for the most part you have to be
able to defender yourself in Eppanol.
'X': As in X-rated. Catholic Spain is one of Europe's most sexually active

shows popping out all over Madrid.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (6): The strain in Spain - Pressures for
greater regional autonomy are growing stronger
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

<TEXT>
RUNNING SPAIN must sometimes feel a little like drifting on a liferaft of
oil drums tied together with thin string. The longer the craft stays in the
water the weaker the binding becomes and the cans begin to move ominously.
Although bound by the 1978 Constitution, the 17 autonomous regions that make
up modern Spain are beginning to jostle about, rubbing up against each other
and pressing the central government for more autonomy. The problem is not
that the raft is falling apart but rather that it is costing Madrid a lot
more money to keep it together.
With Spain's public sector deficit running at 4.4 per cent of GDP
(opposition parties claim it is much higher) a recent OECD report on the
Spanish economy surprised no-one by insisting that 'one of the main causes
for high deficits is expansionary policy by regional governments'.
While the central government deficit has been falling since 1985, regional
debt has risen from 0.3 per cent of GDP in 1985 to more than 1.5 per cent
last year. The OECD accuses the regions of spending money on flashy projects
and of paying their civil servants - many of whom duplicate jobs being done
in Madrid - more than central government pays its own.
Frustrated by Madrid's reluctance to throw more money at them, the regions
have begun to tap local and international capital markets for funds. Many
are close to breaching their legal debt limits - interest payments may not
be more than 25 per cent of revenues - and one, Cantabria, technically
bankrupted itself last year.
The OECD calls on Madrid (in truth, OECD country reports are usually written
with the assistance of the Finance Ministry concerned) to tighten up these
limits and to make it clear to lenders that the State is not underwriting
regional borrowing.
But that misses the crucial political point. The borrowing is just a symptom
of the tremendous head of regionalist political steam built up because of
the federal vision held out by the 1978 Constitution. Although the complex
constitutional system gives some regions - Catalonia, the Basque Country,
Galicia and Andalucia - more autonomy more rapidly than the others, all 17
regions are basically promised the freedom, in time, to run their internal
affairs.
Madrid's difficulty is that it never really rid itself of the centralist
tradition inherited from Franco and is trying to grant autonomy at its pace
while many of the regions run by regional parties are trying to grab, in
Madrid's view, too much too quickly. It is arguable that devolved power can
never create a true federation anyway and that federal states such as
Germany and the US function because the devolution went the other way - from
the states to the centre.
The tension between regions and Madrid stands to reason: the politics of the
regions are fundamentally nationalist, or even ethnic. It is essential to
the electability of a regional party that Madrid be painted as an inadequate
provider, as a distributor of Catalan taxes to Extremadura or of encouraging
investment in Andalucia at the Basque Country's expense.
Much of this is game playing. But it can sound very threatening. Both
Catalonia and the Basque Country are run by conservative nationalist parties
whose leaders periodically say almost seditious things. Last year, the
Catalan leader observed that Catalonia was in a very similar situation to
Lithuania, which was then becoming independent of the former Soviet Union.
Did he mean Catalonia should be independent too?
He said no, not at all, and then promptly began to press Madrid for more
money and, to his horror, had his bluff called. In negotiations last year to
redesign the financial arrangements between the regions and Madrid Catalonia
began to press loudly for the right to be able to spend the taxes raised in
Catalonia. Madrid soon shut this up by suggesting the Catalan government
might like to raise these taxes itself too, as the Basques do.
This was not what the Catalans had in mind. Raising (in the sense of
collecting or increasing) taxes is not a politically attractive thing to do.
The Catalan Government simply wanted to spend what Madrid had collected. So
the demand was quietly dropped.
But the fuss about more autonomy is not just a harmless struggle for money.
Slowly but surely it is changing the face of Spanish politics as the large
centralist parties weaken and the regionalists grow. It is quite possible,
for instance, that the next Spanish general election (to be held between now
and October next year) will force Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez's
socialists into a coalition with either the ruling Catalan CiU or the ruling
Basque PNV. Both these parties send MPs to Madrid and the CiU is the third
largest party in the House.
The large conservative opposition, the Partido Popular (PP), has also been
forced to compromise. In Navarra, for instance, it has an agreement under
which it supports the ruling UPN in regional elections and in turn expects
the UPN vote to come to it in general elections. The PP has also formed
alliances with regionalist groups in Aragon and local ones in Valencia and
Seville.
At another level, regions controlled by socialist party or PP leaders are
also being forced to champion regional themes with which their centralist
party leaderships are uncomfortable. In socialist Andalucia, for example,
the regional government fights constant skirmishes with Madrid over health
policy. Andalucia is one of the few regions with its own health service and
claims Madrid, in order to save money, constantly delays making budgeted
transfers to Seville which, in turn, borrows money in the capital markets to
make up shortfalls and thus infuriates Madrid.
Meanwhile, Galicia, which the PP controls through its maverick founder, the
former Francoist minister Manuel Fraga, is leading a sudden charge to
redesign totally the way the historic autonomies - Catalonia, the Basque
Country and Galicia - are run. He has called for the creation of a single
administration in each territory, meaning that centrally appointed civil
governors and other officials would be withdrawn. Madrid would thus delegate
all its powers - including control of the police - to the leader in these
regions.
It just happens that the socialists control none of the three historic
autonomies (though they are the junior coalition partner in the Basque
Country) and the idea therefore is unlikely to get very far now. But
Catalonia's leadership likes it and single administration may yet make
headway if the Catalan CiU is able to force the socialists into a coalition
after the next national election.
For the CiU and the Basque PNV, the need to be seen to be making progress on
questions of autonomy (even if it is sometimes illusory) is critical because
they are constantly being chased in their own backyards by smaller parties
which genuinely want independence for their regions and not just more
national resources.
This is even beginning now in Aragon and while Basque separatists regularly
take about 16 per cent of the Basque vote there has been a sharp increase in
support recently for the separatist Catalan party ERC. That is a direct
result of the Catalan leader, Mr Jordi Pujol, exciting nationalist fervour,
and backing off. Whenever he does this he leaves a separatist residue for
the ERC to pick up.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (5): The hesitant tendency - Trade unions
drift uneasily into a showdown with Madrid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IF THEIR own rhetoric is any guide, then the next 12 months
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
perhaps the next 12 weeks - are going to be extremely testing for Spain's
two big trades unions, the socialist General Workers Union (UGT) and the
communist Workers' Commissions (CCOO).
Both have pronounced the economic convergence plan presented to the country
by the Government in April, and its steep cuts in unemployment benefits, as
the worst attack ever by a democratic Spanish government on the country's
work force. Both promised to respond with all their might.
A series of nationwide stoppages, in late May and in October, now threaten
the country's 1992 celebrations. Nevertheless, the unions have been
strangely divided about their reaction to the Plan, and especially the cuts
in unemployment benefit which are central to it.
Mr Nicolas Redondo, the ageing UGT leader and Prime Minister Felipe
Gonzalez's political godfather in the 1970s, has been so outraged by the
plans that he moved well beyond the normally more radical CCOO, and was
first to call for a general strike.
Only weeks after the decree implementing the benefits were published he and
the CCCO leadership able to agree on a time table for union action.
Their initial inability to say the same thing in the face of the same threat
was a telling reminder of how cleverly the Government has begun to spot
weaknesses in what was assumed to be a solid trade union front. The UGT and
the CCOO combined very effectively to organise a one day general strike in
December 1988 against government employment policies.
A long drama is being played out here. After Franco's death the unions
managed to win, in spite of relatively small memberships, a role in the way
Spain constructed its new democracy.
They had, after all, been brutally treated under the dictatorship and were
regarded in the late 1970s as one of the three 'social partners' (along with
business and government) essential to the smooth running of a consensual
democracy.
This was especially true for the UGT, which was founded by the now ruling
socialist party almost a century earlier. When the socialists came to power
the UGT effectively did too. All socialist MPs were automatically UGT
members.
Inevitably, this relationship broke down. Under prime minister Felipe
Gonzalez, economic policy has drifted well to the right and annual three-way
wage negotiations between the social partners became increasingly difficult
to sustain and were last held six years ago.
The Government's decision to enter the EC imposed new modernising priorities
on economic policy and few people were surprised when the Socialists and the
UGT formally split three years ago.
It was then, on December 14, 1988, that the unions seemed to have won the
upper hand by calling a highly successful one day general strike that
paralysed the country.
But time has radically narrowed the union's chances of success. Firstly, it
was always obvious that the 1988 strike was successful mainly because people
simply decided to take the day off work rather than try to reach their
offices.
Now, too, the Government has made it clear it has no intention of
negotiating the convergence plan with the unions. That means they will not
be able to draw Madrid into a public debate outside the Government's control
(as was the case in 1988 over a youth employment scheme that triggered the
strike).
It means both the UGT and the CCOO are sparring with an opponent who refuses
to come out of his corner. The public is not yet outraged and the widely
varying action time scales of the two leaders are a sharp contrast with the
unity they developed in 1988.
The Government has been extremely clever. Without debate the public only
hear the complaints of union officials. These never get on to the public
public television and radio channels, however, and even the biggest
opposition newspaper, the conservative ABC, has been strangely muted on the
issue.
That is because the conserva tive opposition, the Partido Popular, has, with
its keen nose for opportunity, rushed to embrace the unions and promised to
fight the convergence plan with them while the main business confederation,
the CEOE, thinks the plan is just what Spain needs. The CEOE carries
considerable clout in ABC.
It leaves the unions with probably only one effective voice in the media,
the already stridently critical newspaper El Mundo, to champion opposition
to the convergence plan. El Mundo is extremely critical about everything the
Government does and it is hard to imagine how it could become noticeably
more so now.
No-one in Madrid, in or out of Government, is suggesting the unions will not
be able to mount loud and perhaps disruptive protests against the
convergence plan but few peo ple seem to be worried that action could be
sustained for very long.
Certainly, the government seems to have built the probability of strike
action into its planning of the convergence programme but it feels it has
the unions in a weak position. As any strikes will not be about pay, the
public's sympathy might be harder to mobilise.
Less than 15 per cent of the Spanish workforce is unionised anyway and
Madrid seems to have got away with another divisive tactic earlier this
year. This was its refusal to negotiate a difficult round of job and
capacity cuts in industries owned or controlled by the state on a sectoral
basis. Instead, they are being implemented on a company by company basis,
robbing the unions of large platforms upon which to co-ordinate their
responses.
Gradually, the Government may be winning a battle to remove the unions from
the post-Franco pedestal upon which they were placed. The effort is to
reduce them to mere bargainers for wages and conditions with the people who
directly employ them.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (4): The people's friend - An interview with
Alvaro Gil-Robles, the Spanish ombudsman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALVARO GIL-ROBLES is, officially, the people's friend. The son of a
controversial conservative leader during the Spanish republic 1932-1936, he
is el Defensor del Pueblo,the Government-appointed ombudsman to the nation.
Gil-Robles sees the down-side of Spanish life as people bring him their
complaints. But he is also an optimist - an educated and demanding Spain is,
he says, rapidly shedding the detritus of half a millennium of misrule and
conflict.
QUESTION: It is 500 years since Spain as we know it was created. Has the way
Spaniards and their rulers regard each other changed much since then?
ANSWER: Yes and no. The Spanish people have 500 years of conflict behind
them. Spain has undergone a great transformation, more in the past few years
than at any other time. They have learned the lessons of many years of
misunderstandings, of angry and violent conflicts, and have established a
basis for peaceful understanding between each other. They have also learned
they cannot live in isolation. They have had to open themselves to the
European phenomenon and this has required an important mental leap. They
want public services to work and although everyone complains, they pay their
taxes. Also, this is the first time parties of all ideologies have backed a
single Constitution while at the same time we have set a great regional
(political) project in train.
So is this once centralised country becoming a federal one?
I really cannot say. Not long ago the thought of politically autonomous
regions (the 1978 Constitution established 17) would have been distant and
strange to many millions of Spaniards. This was a centralised culture and we
had had centuries of other models failing. Now, suddenly, the regional ideal
seems possible. The regions have their own dynamic, they have not distorted
the country, they have not made it poorer.
But after the Reconquest ended in 1492 Spaniards seemed to surrender their
hard-fought liberty back to a powerful central power. Are they now taking it
back?
The key is education. By the start of this century, Spain was riddled with
inequalities. Millions of citizens had no real access to culture or
education. Wealth was very badly distributed. Until the 1960s, we were a
nation of emigrants, a people without a modern economy. There was nothing to
do but leave. But things have changed with education. There is time now to
look at how they are organised. Spaniards want to know how to remain
competitive and to make public services work and how we will combine giving
more (autonomy) to those regions that want it with less to those which do
not.
Are Spaniards in the countryside, in small towns, really aware of what being
part of Europe implies?
I have my doubts. The Spaniard in Granada, for example, knows that Europe is
a reality, that the country cannot live in isolation and that we have to
work within Europe. But he is beginning to discover that this implies
sacrifices. I think, though, that he is less distrustful of Europe than a
Frenchman in Lyon, or an Englishman in Manchester. The problems Maastricht
created have been much easier to deal with in this country, knowing that it
(the decisions taken by the EC summit in Maastricht last December to proceed
with economic union) is a decisive step with enormous consequences.
But how is it possible to sell these messages when there seems to be such a
wide gap between political life in Madrid and what happens to ordinary
people in the provinces?
Madrid is extremely lively politically and the rest of the country follows
its own pace but I would not say the rest of the country is not informed.
Maybe the rest have not begun to think about the consequences of Europe,
positive and negative. People are still filled with expectation, living out
the transition (to democracy) with many problems of their own. Europe may
not be a tangible thing. It is still a young idea here.
At Maastricht Spain pledged to converge its economy with the rest of the EC
by 1997. How will the country react to what could be a second transition,
another modernising leap?
One has always known that we Spaniards are capable of doing extraordinary
things very quickly. The question is whether we can also be long-distance
runners. I belive we can be. Convergence will force us to stop thinking
about today. We will have to begin to be professional, rigorous, serious, to
plan. We need to drop our bad habit of wanting everything to happen at once.
One example is the tourist industry. We have destroyed our coasts and built
a poor tourist infrastructure, but when the Expo happens in Seville or the
Olympics take place in Barcelona suddenly hotel prices rocket. This is awful
and there is no reason for it if we want to maintain serious and solid
tourism polices.
What do Spaniards complain about?
About many things but they do it with intelligence. They complain because
the system of justice is so slow. It's a fact and important to the economy.
Part of the principle of legal security is that justice is agile. They want
the public administration to improve and to be a service rather than an
intrument of power. They want that when they have a sore ear the social
security don't hand them a piece of paper and tell them to see a specialist
in three months. Our public administration has many old vices. It is
centered on itself and not connected to the people.
But people know how to complain, which is an important indication of a civic
culture. People who come here are desperate. The administration can drive
people crazy.
Where has Spanish democracy implanted itself most firmly?
In the municipalities. The town halls of Spain, which were once very poorly
run, are become very efficient. They have moved very close to their
citizens. Especially in small towns, the mayors are in constant contact with
the people. For that reason municipal life is hard; the people are on top of
them all the time.
There is much discussion about corruption is Spain. Is it universal in
public life?
In the last few years you could say that a money cult has been let loose
among the people. They need to spend, to consume, to show off. This has
created a consumer culture and the idea that you can be measured by your
financial success. It has affected ordinary people, industry and commerce.
Many people are living beyond their means and the money phenomenon has made
people lose their respect for work. This has created the sensation in some
parts of society that it is better to be unemployed than to work. We need to
recover some old values, of work, of seriousness, of honesty.
The Constitution gives political parties a presence in a very wide range of
Spanish institutions - from broadcast media to savings banks to the
selection of judges. Is this not dangerous?
The idea that everything political is corrupt or negative is wrong. What
matters is transparency in how institutions work, how people get into them
and how they take decisions. Civil liberties are better established here
than in most of Europe. People speak here with a freedom that never existed
before. The Spanish press is one of the freest in the world. In the
dictatorship everything depended on the central power. Not a school was
built, nor a road, nor a business created, nor a doctor consulted, without a
nod from Madrid.
Is Spain still a Catholic country?
Spaniards have become very tolerant but everyone still carries cultural and
sociological traces of religion. The other question is whether they
practise. But they are respectful and do not attack the religious feelings
of others. Popular fiestas and important family events continue to be linked
to religion for all of our lives.
France, Italy and Germany have all experienced outbreaks of feeling against
immigrants. Will Spaniards prove to be racist when immigrants begin to
arrive here in great numbers?
I don't think we are different and we have already experienced outbreaks of
violence against Gypsies. Racism is not a problem yet but as a society grows
richer it becomes more protective of its interests and shows less solidarity
with others. But we were once a nation of emigrants and we should be more
understanding. I don't know what will happen when we are put to the test.
What does 1992 mean for Spain?
It is profoundly important. We are certifying the fact that we have come out
of the tunnel of a history as a paralysed country. This country no longer
wants to close itself off from the Pyrenees down. We are no longer what
people thought. For years people carried a photograph of us fixed in time
with our carts and donkeys. This is over now. This country is alive.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (3): Heirs not so apparent are waiting in
the wings - Some of the leaders who could one day win the top job
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Spanish Socialist Workers Party (PSOE) is a tightly disciplined and very
effective machine.
It has dominated Spanish politics for nearly a decade because it is better
organised than any of its national conservative or radical rivals. But its
very discipline has meant it has been impossible for good politicians to
project themselves beyond the party and, assuming Mr Felipe Gonzalez fights
only one more election as Prime Minister, it is hard to be precise about his
possible successors.
An election has to be held before October 1993 and the next one four years
later. All that is too late for one of the wisest men in the Cabinet, the
foreign minister, Mr Francisco Fernandez Ordonez, and too early, probably,
for one of the brightest battle tested politicians in the party, Mr Ramon
Jauregui, PSOE leader in the Basque Country.
Two things are, however, likely: a replacement to fight the last election of
the century will come from within the party and, second, anyone too closely
associated with the former left wing deputy prime minister and current party
vice president, Mr Alfonso Guerra, would probably be unelectable.
Five possible candidates to replace Mr Gonzalez are briefly profiled, in
alphabetical order, below:
Jose Bono Martinez: A lawyer and president of the autonomous region of
Castilla-La Mancha in central Spain since 1983.
He was once considered a confidante of Alfonso Guerra, who runs the party
machine. But Felipe Gonzalez has begun to lean on regional leaders like Mr
Bono to offset left wing pressure from party headquarters in Madrid, drawing
them closer to Government and away from party.
Mr Bono is developing a reputation as a socialist powerbroker and allowed
himself to be associated in public with the conservative finance minister,
Mr Carlos Solchaga, when the latter was being shunned by many party
colleagues. That did not necessarily mean support, but rather an attempt to
appear above intra-party bickering. The press likes him.
Jose Borrell Fontelles: Young and intense, Borrell is minister of Public
Works and Transport, the biggest spender in the Cabinet.
Secretary of State for the revenue service until his elevation to the
Cabinet last year, Borrell has, along with the Prime Minister, probably the
most pristine reputation in Government. It was Borrell who persuaded tax
evasion charges against the brother of former deputy premier Alfonso Guerra.
Increasingly independent, he is not greatly liked in party headquarters but
that may not be a long-term handicap. The longer Gonzalez remains in office,
the brighter Borrell's prospects. As minister for public works, he is able
to score political points by associating himself with the country's grandest
projects.
Narcis Serra i Serra: Deputy Prime Minister and the most likely successor to
Gonzalez in the short term. A consummate politician, Serra has been given
the task of smoothing poor relations between the Government and party
officials unhappy with conservative economic policy. Also, he is Catalan
(and speaks it) which is a plus for any PSOE leader as Spain's regions -
Catalonia being the strongest - press for more autonomy.
An accomplished pianist, Serra was Mayor of Barcelona in the 1970s and made
his political mark as Defence Minister between 1982 and 1991, familiarising
an unhappy military with the joys of democracy. The party machine is warming
to him but he has little public charisma and would not be an impressive
campaigner.
Javier Solana Madariaga: Education Minister and former culture minister and
government spokesman. Solana has managed to push controversial education
reforms through without alienating the unions or students. He nevertheless
keeps a low profile. His position in the party is strong and he is the
senior Madrileno in the executive.
Solana has managed to escape being identified too closely with either the
left or right of the party, though for a while in the 1980s his brother's
chairmanship of the telephone monopoly Telefonica and, later, the
state-owned television and radio stations invited some accusations of
nepotism. Probably a conservative, he would become a compromise candidate in
a race between stronger claimants.
Carlos Solchaga Catalan: The architect of the socialist government's rapid
drift towards liberal market economic policies, Solchaga probably has more
political enemies than any other Spanish politician today.
He has a small power base in his home region of Navarra but the party is
deeply suspicious of him. Relenting on big budget cuts planned for this year
helped that relationship.
Mostly, Solchaga speaks to Gonzalez and Serra, who then tell the party what
new misery he plans to inflict on socialism. It makes it unlikely the party
could ever bring itself to elect him leader, or prime ministerial candidate,
but that does not mean he would not want the job. Confident and dismissive
of doubters, he is the best infighter in the Cabinet.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (2): Ten years, and still running - Prime
Minister Felipe Gonzalez resets his sights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FELIPE GONZALEZ can seem so careless sometimes. 'It makes you want to shake
him,' says a long time admirer. When he rose to the speaker's podium in
Parliament in March to deliver his state of the nation address he seemed
tired and distant.
Such Gonzalez appearances are rare and eagerly anticipated as much by his
opponents as by his friends. But the speech was delivered in a monotone -
most of it was read in a hurry - and he only stopped once to chuckle. No one
else caught the joke. Was he laughing at his own performance or at what he
was reading?
It was astonishing, really. The Spanish Prime Minister was proposing a
radical effort to reform or crush the stubborn rigidities in Spanish life -
from the easy frauds that encourage people to become officially unemployed
to the comfortable guilds that protect and preserve the high costs of
professional services. These go to the very core of the way Spaniards live.
It was only a few days later, when the Finance Minister had put some meat on
the bones Mr Gonzalez had thrown to parliament, that the true import of the
changes dawned on the trades unions. They quickly began to threaten all
manner of revenge, (as discussed in a separate article).
The importance of Mr Gonzalez's off-hand treatment of the unions was a
measure of his state of mind.
Opponents have been suggesting for years that the Prime Minister, who has
been in office since October 1982, is tired. Wild rumours swirl about. One
day he is said to be after the presidency of the European Commission (this
is probably not the case) and the next day his eye is said to be on the
Socialist International (again, no).
A week later, he will be depressed at the strained relations between his
Government and the socialist party, of which he is also leader. Or maybe his
health will be troubling him. Spain lives by rumour and innuendo and all of
this is perfectly normal.
But it is probably reasonable to assume that he is tired. Bored may be a
better word. Mr Gonzalez never wanted to change Spain, just calm it down
after so many years of nervous dictatorship and tumultuous transition. It is
his stated aim to raise Spain to be an average country, with average
European Community incomes, average lifestyles and average output.
This struggle may have been captivating while Spain was a long way from
converging with the rest of its European neighbours. But as Spain gets
closer Mr Gonzalez naturally comes under pressure to reset his sights beyond
nominal convergence and this is hard, even for a politician as successful as
he has been. It means changing gear and taking a constantly bickering party
with him.
The March speech suggested Mr Gonzalez was either not going to bother much
taking his party - still dominated at an administrative level by the Left -
with him or that he had somehow already persuaded the bulk of the
organisation's leadership they had no option to follow him. Given the
subsequent expressions of support for the convergence plan he was outlining,
the latter may well be the case. What is crucial now is how that support
holds up in the face of union attack.
The Left has an interest in not rocking the boat too soon. If the unions
succeed in changing economic policy and the jobless benefit cuts in the
Plan, then Finance Minister Carlos Solchaga's position in the Government
will be greatly weakened. Mr Solchaga is deeply despised in party
headquarters but his strength in Government is, for the moment,
unquestionable.
Just two weeks after making that speech the guts of the convergence plan -
steep cuts in unemployment benefits - had become law.
Although he will allow the party to tinker with the the benefits decree, he
seems to have abandoned his customary caution and, following his instincts,
finally turned both ears to Mr Solchaga, who has told him that unless Spain
dramatically streamlines its top heavy bureaucracy, forces workers to seek
jobs and fiercely attacks high prices - be they lawyers or plumbers' fees -
the country could drift well past the turn of the century trapped by a ring
of inefficient traditions that almost guarantee its mediocrity.
Union pressures may still panic the party but electoral arithmetic makes it
relatively easy for him to be this cavalier. Even if the implementation of
this plan damages socialist party support, there is simply no-one in the
party capable of winning more votes for it in the next general election
(which must be held by October 1993) other than himself. Whatever he does,
the party, which now has exactly half the seats in parliament, will not get
rid of him.
Even assuming a loss of support, from Mr Gonzalez's increasingly
conservative point of view the prospects of a coalition are almost
attractive. This would almost certainly be with the ruling party in
Catalonia, Convergencia i Union (CiU) or, more remotely, with the biggest
Basque party, the PNV.
Both are conservative, and the presence of either in a Gonzalez government
would allow him (and Mr Solchaga) to ignore the more strident left wing of
the socialist party because of the demands of coalition.
A Catalan or Basque partner would add pressure on Madrid to devolve more
power but there is little chance that such a scenario would split the
socialists, who would still be able to enjoy the fruits of power, in the
short term. It is, anyway quite possible that the socialists, under Mr
Gonzalez, might improve their share of the vote in the next election. That
would depend on how well the unions manage their challenge to the
convergence plan.
But the next term of office could take the socialists right up to
convergence and the scheduled creation of Economic and Monetary Union in the
European Community by the end of 1996 and it would be courageous to bet on
the Prime Minister fighting a fifth election then.
His going does not depend on another job being found for him. It depends on
the socialist party being able to find someone who can win elections for it.
Spanish politics concentrate on leaders, not programmes, and without him,
the face of politics here changes completely.
For a start, it means that his current opponent - Mr Jose Maria Aznar, the
leader of the conservative Partido Popular - would become vulnerable to
challenges from an attractive right wing crusader unsullied by years of
opposition politics. Mr Gonzalez's going will be exactly the right time for
such a person to bid for office.
That person may be Mr Mario Conde, a young banker, chairman of Banesto, one
of the country's biggest banks, and an articulate - though still not quite
engaging enough - spokesman for an even freer economy than the pragmatic
socialists have been able to erect. Large parts of the opposition press
already champion him but now is not the moment. No-one will beat Felipe
Gonzalez in the next election but the moment he goes, the search for a new
face, a new voice, begins and it really does not matter which party - within
reason - he or she belongs to.
Nevertheless, assuming that Mr Gonzalez will make his next election his last
is not without risks. There is no grander position in Spain for him to
occupy and the parliament and the senate in Spain are not places anyone with
his talents would want to spend much time as a former leader.
And he is not a rich man. He would probably find it quite hard to buy a good
apartment in Madrid if he had to.
So there is an inertia that keeps him in office. It will not last forever,
though.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Spain (1): Comes the reckoning - Spain is
celebrating its political and economic rebirth in flamboyant style. When the
year's festivities are over, it will be asked to start paying the high price
of its return to democracy and its European Community status
</HEADLINE>

SPAIN'S YEAR of fiesta as it celebrates the 500th anniversary of Christopher
Columbus's voyage to America, the World Fair in Seville and the Olympic
Games in Barcelona, will touch almost 20m people. It is a happy time and the
perfect opportunity to salute Spain's progress since it emerged 16 years ago
from the shadow of an introverted and small-minded dictatorship.
But there is a cloud to this silver lining, probably one which only the
people who run the country saw coming. For 1992 is also the year in which
Spain is being asked to start paying the price of its young democracy's
return to respectability and its entry in 1986 into the European Community.
It is hard to describe what that meant to Spain, although it is measurable.
Between 1986 and 1989 the Spanish economy grew at an average 5 per cent a
year, far outpacing its large Community partners. Foreigners pumped about
Dollars 30bn in direct investment into the country and more than Dollars
300bn into its debt and equity markets. Poor Spaniards rushed to fill their
tiny homes with fridges and TV sets. Old cars were left to rot in ditches
while new ones filled the streets.
As imports were sucked in, Spain's current account plunged into deficit and
has risen from surplus to a Dollars 16bn deficit in four years while the
central government and 17 autonomous regional governments, not to be
outdone, jumped on the freespending bandwagon.
By last year central and regional government were borrowing some Dollars
23bn to finance their budgets, double 1989 borrowings, and efforts to stick
with budgetary limits were simply thrown out of the window. Last year, the
central government planned for a Dollars 5bn budget deficit and ended the
year with a figure nearly three times bigger, passing the budget target in
about April.
This year, the figure is a more realistic Dollars 11bn but even that might
be wildly optimistic. The state's cash deficit - which excludes interest
payments - by the end of the first quarter of this year was 45 per cent
higher than in 1990.
The figures are, in themselves, manageable, but the socialist government of
Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez, in its 10th year in office, has an agenda
that gets in the way. Mr Gonzalez is not really a socialist. He is a modern
nationalist determined that his country should not be left floundering with
Portugal and Greece once the European Community goes ahead with economic and
monetary union and mints a single currency.
There may be arguments for waiting beyond the 1997 or 1999 deadlines set by
the EC for this but they fall on deaf ears in Madrid's ministries. The
Gonzalez legacy to Spain will be to have shovelled it into the heart of
Europe and locked it in, irreversibly, at the earliest possible opportunity.
The Prime Minister knows better than anyone that unless Spain is pushed, it
would find 1,000 reasons not to jump. When he and his Finance Minister, Mr
Carlos Solchaga, went to the Maastricht summit of EC leaders last December
it was to deliver just that push by committing Madrid to the tough
macroeconomic targets the summit established as necessary for any EC member
to enter into EMU. Unless the Community's direction radically changes and
Maastricht is discarded or softened to allow for the entry of new members,
la suerte esta echada. For Spain, the die is cast.
Madrid has five years to meet those targets, which will demand big cuts in
inflation, interest rates and the public deficit. It is not a long time,
considering that Spain failed to impose this promised discipline during the
good years after 1986 and is now going to have to find a way to do so, and
continue growing faster than the EC average, in a period of economic
slowdown.
Many of the targets in the convergence plan drawn up by Mr Solchaga seem
quite optimistic, including 3 per cent growth this year and a reduction in
the public deficit from a massive 4.4 per cent of gdp last year to just one
per cent at the end of 1996. Spaniards have heard these promises before and
they have always been sacrificed to political expediency and pressure from
the socialist party. It happened last year when Mr Solchaga's tough budget
draft was expanded to still party unease.
While the plan's targets go beyond what Maastricht demanded the jury will
stay out this time until it sees clear evidence of implementation. Mr
Gonzalez has to call a general election before October next year and Mr
Solchaga's next budget will be the last before that poll. Experience
suggests he will try to be true to the apparent freedom Mr Gonzalez has
given him to rein in public spending but, equally, that the party may fight
it.
But visitors to Spain's 1992 celebrations may run foul of convergence fairly
quickly. Mr Solchaga, acutely aware that his plans to cut spending and to
liberalise protected service industries could run in to all manner of
hurdles if socialists political prospects begin to dim, in April took the
unusual step of decreeing, without much debate, a sweeping cut in
unemployment benefits which he combined with an increase in the time in work
required to qualify for benefit. The measure could save Madrid up to Dollars
4bn this year alone.
The trade unions, which behave in Spain as an extraparliamentary opposition,
were quick to respond.
They called a half day general strike last week and, unless the decree is
withdrawn, a full day general strike will be held in October as well. The
government is so far refusing to withdraw it and is managing, so far, to
keep socialist party nerves steady by promising small changes. If the unions
get the upper hand, more would be given away.
For the moment, considerable labour unrest in the summer and autumn is
almost inevitable, but it is the unions, not the Government, who might find
the going tougher. As the strikes will not be about pay, it might be harder
to sustain any mobilisation.
What is happening could fundamentally change Spain. If the Government gets
through the strikes and an election unscathed or even as leader of a
coalition (which, if it were with the big Catalan party Convergencia i
Union, would not overly bother Mr Gonzalez), it should have little
difficulty implementing the rest of the convergence plan. That would blow
away cobwebs - the pharmacy monopoly, ancient and powerful professional
colleges, secure professorships and the doors that still remain closed to
foreigners - in which much of Spain's economic culture is still trapped.
In spite of the rapid modernisation of the country's infrastructure and
financial markets, Spain still has to make one more giant leap before it can
sit at the same table with the richer Community powers it so yearns to
emulate. It is not a competitive economy yet. A recent confidential survey
by the Industry Ministry found that fewer than half of Spanish businesses
knew what effect the Single Market would have on them from next year.
Nevertheless, local businesses had quickly absorbed the implications of one
of the Government's boldest recent decisions - to lift all capital controls
 -and almost half of the companies consulted said they intended dropping
high cost Spanish banks to search for more competitive lenders elsewhere in
the EC.
The only way for a Spanish bank to compete with that kind of pressure is to
cut its lending rates and reduce the industry's huge lending margins (around
4 per cent of total assets, the ECs highest after Greece and Portugal) to
competitive Community levels. News like that must make life worth living for
Mr Solchaga, who is attacked almost constantly and by almost everyone for
forcing this economy to compete. But, somehow, in a pre-electoral period,
with fixed capital formation plummeting (from 14 per cent growth in 1988 to
a tiny 1.6 per cent rise last year), with unions on the attack and no
obvious world economic upturn guaranteed to help him, he has to find a way
of animating the economy, or at least disguising the bad news, without
heating it up again. It is impossible to second guess the Government, but it
seems unlikely Madrid will try to enter the narrow band of the European
Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism before an election. The fiscal
sacrifice required to hold the peseta to a fluctuation of just 2.25 per cent
against its partner currencies would be immense and politically dangerous.
The government's best bet, it seems, would be to ride out the union protests
against its benefit cuts. Spaniards may react badly to too much disruption
and people are aware that the economy is delicate. If this works to the
Government's favour an early election is possible. In order to avoid a clash
with Expo, however (it ends on October 12), this might mean going to the
polls in winter, which might not be popular. One thing not in doubt -
barring disaster - is that Mr Gonzalez will be Prime Minister before and
after that election and the only remaining question is how long he will then
want to carry on.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (5): Further expansion possible for
Glaxo - Profile
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU are one of the millions of people round the world who suffer from
peptic ulcers then there is a good chance that the treatment you take is
manufactured in Singapore.
Zantac, the ulcer treatment tablet made by the UK pharmaceutical giant
Glaxo, has an estimated 40 per cent of the world market for such drugs.
Glaxo describes Zantac as the world's best-selling medicine, with sales of
Pounds 1.6bn in the year to June 1991. Singapore produces the ingredients
for more than 70 per cent of Zantac's worldwide sales.
Glaxo has been in Singapore since the late 1940s but has only been
manufacturing in the island republic since the early 80s. The specialist
ingredients for Zantac arrive in Singapore by ship from Europe and are then
manufactured into powder form at Glaxo's plant in the Jurong industrial
estate before being air freighted out in drums and made up into tablets,
packaged and distributed in the various markets around the world.
'Back in the late 70s, Glaxo decided to go global and Singapore was chosen
as the best location for manufacturing,' says Dr Alan Catterall, managing
director of Glaxo's Singapore operations. The success of the Singapore plant
is due to success of Zantac. Nearly 50 per cent of Glaxo's total sales now
come from Zantac.
The highly-automated Singapore plant started operations with 120 workers;
there are now 300. A new plant is being built on an adjacent site wich will
employ an additional 170 workers to manufacture the active ingredients for a
new range of drugs.
The efficiency of operations at Singapore's docks are essential for the
smooth running of the Glaxo plant. The expansion of Singapore's Changhi
airport and the good connections available are also key factors determining
Glaxo's expansion in the island republic.
But like many companies in Singapore, Glaxo now finds it difficult to
recruit workers. 'The labour market is very tight,' says Dr Catterall. 'We
are now having to look around the region for skilled people, or recruit them
from Europe.'
Glaxo feels these staff problems will be overcome and does not rule out
further expansion plans. 'It's things like the support services that are
available here that make the difference,' says Dr Catterall. 'If one of our
highly complex machines breaks down someone will be out here to fix it in
under half an hour. Elsewhere in the world, it might take 24 hours and
valuable production time would be lost.'

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (8): Performance slumps - Financial
Services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOYCE QUEK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE financial services sector was unable to sustain its reliable performance
of the previous years. Its growth in 1991 slumped to 2.9 per cent against 19
per cent in 1990.
The worldwide consolidation in international banking activities and
financial risk management business had affected Singapore-based foreign
institutions' offshore lending activities and foreign exchange business.
There were mixed signals about business expectations for the second and
third quarters, with commercial banks and finance companies pessimistic
while stock and bond brokers were more optimistic. A recovery and rise of
the financial futures market has been the silver lining.
Despite their gloom, the so-called Big Four local banks are meeting and
beating analysts' forecasts of record profits for 1991 despite slower loan
growth and interbank rates dipping below fixed deposit rates. So far,
state-linked DBS Bank's earnings have leapt 19.4 per cent to SDollars 278.4m
in 1991, Overseas Union Bank's net after-tax profits expanded 14.3 per cent
to SDollars 70.7m, while OCBC Bank forged 20.2 per cent to SDollars 168.3m.
OUB attributed its results to better interest margins while DBS Bank
disclosed net interest earnings at a record SDollars 264m in the second
half-year. Interest spreads have widened since January to 2.75 points, say
analysts. Brokers Hoare Govette note that the contraction of Asian Currency
Unit assets, a big factor in the slowdown, had little effect on local banks'
profits. It added that if the stock market volume continued to pick up,
non-banking services such as securities trading should grow. And, with their
capital adequacy ratios exceeding 12 per cent, the banks can enlarge their
international lending.
Simex, the Singapore International Monetary Exchange, had its best start
this year with January's all-time high of 965,692 contracts traded vaulting
25.9 per cent above the previous record of 767,143 contracts in March 1989.
January's daily average volume of 43,895 contracts was also the highest
level since Simex started trading in 1984.
The exchange's total volume in 1991 resumed an up trend of 6.1m contracts
after faltering in 1990 to 5.7m, due to lower price volatility in the first
half. The daily average also moved up from 22,791 contracts in 1990 to
24,175.
Interest rate volatility and increasing international participation
accounted for the massive leap in volume. Recognising the increased
interest, especially from its European customers, the exchange extended
trading hours for interest rate and energy contracts from February.
Interest rate contracts were again the mainstays with 82.6 per cent of the
total volume, ahead of the Nikkei 225 Stock Average with 11.9 per cent. To
diversify, Simex has launched an options contract based on the Nikkei 225,
which was the first contract written on the Japanese stock index. As Mr
Pierre Essig, chief executive officer of Fimat Futures Asia saw it: 'There
should be a strong demand for the new contract. The sheer size of the
underlying Nikkei futures clearly suggests the market has a good appetite
for an options contract written on the futures. Furthermore, the
American-styled options, coupled with extended back months, are added
attractions. Simex offers 15 contracts and the most active Eurodollar
futures outside of Chicago.
It was another story on the Stock Exchange of Singapore, where turnover fell
to SDollars 30.5bn in 1991 from SDollars 36.8bn in 1990. The pick-up in
activity after the Gulf war was not sustainable as other external factors in
the US, European and Japanese economies had a dampening effect. Against the
SDollars 3.5bn raised through the market in 1990, last year saw only
SDollars 1.3bn raised, with SDollars 279m from the flotation of 10 new
companies, many of them government-linked.
Two more serious cases of multiple share applications are being taken to
court. The SES has worked towards raising the standard of accountability and
disclosure to shareholders by directors. For example, companies'
equity-raising exercises must fully disclose their intended use. Such
ever-tightening controls may provide comfort to investors, say industry
members, but it also scares business elsewhere, such as Hong Kong.
The tightening-up measures are not unlike those taken in the banking and
insurance industries. The authorities do not apologise for their prudential
supervision or make secret their preference for supervising a smaller number
of strong institutions rather than a larger number of weaker firms.
A large number of foreign institutions have been granted international
membership. For a comparatively pricey SDollars 30m in view of the current
low trading volume, Credit Lyonnais, Baring Securities, Smith New Court,
Daiwa, Nikko, Nomura, and Yamaichi Securities can deal for non-resident
clients but are restricted to trades above SDollars 5m for Singapore
residents.
In line with its more liberal approach to opening up the market to foreign
brokers, the invitation to banks and foreign brokerages to apply for seats
could spell mergers and acquisitions of the smaller-capitalised local firms
unwilling or unable to raise their share capital to a possible adjusted net
capital target of SDollars 20m
There has been disappointment that the listing of Singapore Telecom, with a
potential market capitalisation of SDollars 10bn, has been put off till next
year. However, the success of a steady stream of initial public offerings to
date will maintain interest in listing candidates such as garment
manufacturer Heshe Holdings and Keppel Corporation subsidiaries Keppel
Integrated Engineering and Keppel Bank.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (9): Mixed trends and fortunes - Hotels
and Property
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOYCE QUEK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID groans over the Singapore government's intention to release 84 hectares
from 1991 to 1993 for development, the property scene has one group
despairing over a potential glut while another, led by hotels, is finding
profitable niches.
A third group, in line with the international re-awakening over preservation
and the environment, is involved in conservation properties. It is bringing
more colour to its projects and reaping commercial returns.
The glut theory stems from 1m sq ft of commercial space available during the
four years to 1995 against a take-up of 140,000 sq ft annually. In the same
period, there will be a supply of 4,170 apartments a year against demand for
3,000.
This theory was strengthened by a lack of bidders, for the first time since
1987, for a hotel-shopping-office development. And unlike the 1987 example,
the latest case, in February, was a prime property beside the main Orchard
Road shopping thoroughfare, designated to be a 900-room hotel with a
six-storey podium at a reserve price of SDollars 434m.
Knight Frank Cheong Hock Chye &amp; Bailleau, property consultants, said that
rents in Orchard Road shopping complexes had slipped 5-10 per cent last year
while the industrial property market would be healthy until end-1992 when
some 1.6m sq ft of new factory and warehouse space comes on stream.
Richard Ellis, another consultant, noted that the 11 per cent fall in office
rents last year reversed upward spirals of 64 per cent and 16.5 per cent in
1989 and 1990, which explained why the outlook for office space and the
general property market was uncertain. But it added that 'while prospects
may not be as gloomy as what had been projected, short-term problems such as
slower economic growth and a perception of over-supply will prevail.'
However, the consultancy believes there will be a slight downward pressure
on office rents in 1992 as companies will have taken into consideration the
anticipated new supply of space. Tenants can expect indirect discounts such
as long rent-free periods, cash contributions towards fitting-out costs and
12-15 per cent discounts on the signing of longer leases of six years.
Buyers of residential properties are already getting discounts of between 5
per cent and 20 per cent. This has brought prices down to an average
SDollars 400-SDollars 500 per sq ft level. Most observers believe that
residential property prices will fall anywhere from 5 per cent to 30 per
cent over the next few years. However, the trend may be reversed when
discounts and low interest rates draw homebuyers into the market.
This scenario has not dissuaded companies such as the listed First Capital
Corporation, with a war chest of SDollars 250m, from developing a sizeable
share of the residential property development, said a Kay Hian James Capel
residential property review. The broking firm said that more big players
would emerge in this arena in the next few years as the government releases
more land for sale. They could include Hotel Marco Polo, Hotel Properties
(which operates the Hilton and Four Season Hotels), and the Kuok group of
Shangri-la fame.
Tourists have returned to Singapore despite the effects of the Gulf war, the
vanishing Japanese big spenders and a slowing world economy. Arrivals were
up 1.7 per cent to 5.4m last year. Mr N. M. Yeo, the Singapore Tourist
Promotion Board's planning and operations director, forecasts a 6-8 per cent
growth for 1992.
The bulk of Singapore-bound tourists come from within the region rather than
from the west. Also, a global economic slowdown tends to send visitors to
countries closer to home. Another boost is that 1992 is Visit Asean Year.
Judging by the success of individual members' promotional efforts, a
combined push should yield positive results.
Hotels did not benefit from the pick-up in tourist arrivals from mid-1991.
The industry's turnover slid 1.8 per cent to SDollars 1.6bn, the occupancy
rate slipped to 76.8 per cent against 80 per cent in 1990, and
hotel-operated food and beverage outlets saw revenue contracting 3.8 per
cent to SDollars 637.8m.
Brokers Hoare Govette, however, point to positive indicators for 1992. Based
on January statistics, actual room lettings rose 2 per cent; average room
rates were up 5 per cent to SDollars 151.60 from year-ago levels; hotel room
revenues were 6.9 per cent higher while food and beverage revenue increased
10.8 per cent. Gross industry revenue grew 9.1 per cent in January.
Another bright spot is in conservation projects. Such projects have become
worthwhile despite conditions imposed which include preservation and
restoration of facades and restrictions on building upwards. Five years ago,
Singapore embarked on a SDollars 1bn effort to conserve and restore its rich
multicultural history so as to broaden its range of visitor attractions.
Ethnic areas such as Arab Street, Chinatown and Little India were marked for
preservation as were buildings such as Empress Place.
One well-known conservation project was the SDollars 160m facelift of that
Singapore landmark, the Raffles Hotel. It was restored to its 1887 tropical
French colonial design. The all-suite hotel has 8,000 pieces of silver and
china dating back to the days of its founders.
Restoration work in the business district has brought life after office
hours. Tanjong Pagar shophouses have focused on retail and entertainment
while Telok Ayer has become a festival market.
The cleaned-up Singapore River enjoys more night life along its banks. The
warehouses and shophouses that once catered to busy traders now support
entertainment and leisure-related activities.
The SDollars 240m Clarke Quay project is the largest conservation project.
It will convert 21,428 sq m of property beside the river into a vibrant
festival marketplace offering a variety of retail, food and service
establishments, activities and entertainment, said Mr Richard Helfer of
managing agent Raffles International.
There will be outdoor cafes, art galleries, restaurants, gift shops and the
Clarke Quay Adventure, billed as an exciting voyage blending fantasy with
reality taking the visitor through Singapore's history.

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (7): A softer approach - Politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KIERAN COOKE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGAPORE'S leaders describe themselves as a team determined to keep their
country ahead 'in the race of nations'.
In late 1990, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, in power for more than 30 years, handed the
baton of office over to Mr Goh Chok Tong. Mr Goh called on Singaporeans to
support a new generation of leaders who would build a fit, cultured but
rugged society. 'Together', said Mr Goh, 'we will run the next lap.'
During his first months in power, Mr Goh sought to establish his own style
of leadership. The stern, authoritarian approach of Mr Lee would be replaced
by a softer style: Mr Goh talked of being more accommodating and of the need
to build a consensus.
There were some small signals of change. Rules prohibiting nude scenes in
films were relaxed. Some mild satire of Singapore's leaders was allowed -
including the sale of a book of cartoons entitled 'Hello Chok Tong, Goodbye
Kuan Yew'. The press indulged in some slight criticism of government
policies.
Last August, Mr Goh called an election - to establish his leadership
credentials at the polls and also to win backing for his new more open style
of government. The results were not good for either Mr Goh or the People's
Action Party, in power since Singapore's independence. The PAP's vote shrank
to 61 per cent - the lowest the party had polled since 1968. The two
opposition parties, the Singapore Democratic Party and the Workers' Party,
won four seats, compared with only one at the last election in 1988.
The election results sent shock waves through a governing team that has
always viewed any opposition or dissent with acute suspicion.
Some members of the government interpreted the results as a sign that the
conservative Singaporean electorate was not in favour of Mr Goh's more open
way of doing things. On the other hand, some analysts felt the PAP could
have lost more votes if Mr Goh had not embarked on his strictly limited
glasnost policy.
More seriously, there were signs that the PAP had lost support among the
Chinese working class - its traditional support base. Mr Lee, still senior
minister and head of the PAP, felt the government had neglected the concerns
of this group. 'I think it was a sense of being squeezed out of the
mainstream, that they were no longer getting the kind of attention that, as
the majority, they should have. . I think that caused the switch,' said Mr
Lee.
Mr Goh acknowledged that the PAP had become too remote and should strive to
be less elitist.
Part of the reason for the PAP's poor showing in the August election was
also due to clever opposition tactics, particularly by the Singapore
Democratic Party which won three out of the four opposition seats.
The opposition only fielded candidates in a limited number of
constituencies, thus ensuring the continuance of the PAP in power. Voters
were offered the chance of registering their dissatisfaction without
threatening the government's survival. 'The voters want to keep the PAP in
power, but they also want a strong opposition to keep an eye on the
government,' says Mr Chiam See Tong, leader of the Singapore Democratic
Party. 'It is a sign that Singapore's democracy is growing up.'
The next challenge facing Mr Goh is a series of by-elections due to take
place in the coming months. Among those standing is likely to be Mr J. B.
Jeyaretnam, the leader of the Workers Party who has been disqualified from
parliament for the past five years.
If Mr Jeyaretnam wins a seat and the PAP once again loses votes, then Mr Goh
would be under considerable pressure from the more hard-line section of the
party led by Mr Lee Hsien Loong, deputy prime minister and son of Mr Lee
Kuan Yew. Another possible contender for power is Mr George Yeo - like Mr
Lee junior an army man - at present minister for information and the arts.
But Mr Goh is a political fighter and he can be tough. As Mr Lee's right
hand man for many years, he played an active role in monitoring dissent in
Singapore.
'If people behave in a manner that will threaten the wider interests of
Singapore,' said Mr Goh recently, 'they will feel the firm smack of the
government.'

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (6): Challenges for the prime minister
</HEADLINE>

In an interview, Mr Goh Chok Tong, Singapore's prime minister, talked about
some of the challenges he faces and the changes he is trying to bring about
in Singapore society.
On the legacy of Lee Kuan Yew: 'Mr Lee was of course exceptional. His
personality was such that he was totally dominant. In my case it's
different. . . I'm not Mr Lee so I do things my way which is more low key, a
lower profile kind of leadership.'
Singapore society: 'We recognise the government has an overwhelming presence
in the economy and in fact in every sphere of a Singaporean's life. So in
recent years we have been trying to shrink the presence of the government. .
. you can see there is uncertainty in people's minds. They want the
government to be there as a safety net, or a guiding hand or to do things
for them.
'At the same time they also dislike the presence of the government in their
daily lives. We want to get people to move out on their own and do more for
themselves. They want it but are not sure that they can succeed. We are at
this stage of development.'
The results of the last election: 'Few people would quarrel with the idea of
a more open style of government and more participation by the people
provided at the end of the day the government is decisive. . .
'But their real concern is Are costs going up? Are they going to do better?
Will their children have a good education? Are they missing out on economic
progress? That's the signal of the way people voted.'
Singapore's military: 'To be able to defend ourselves in one day of battle
we require many years to build up an army. . . I always imagine Singapore to
be a very small state which any adventurer could grab with one hand. Either
you arm yourself to the extent that you can deter any threat or you don't do
so at all - it's not worth spending the money.'
The future: 'I myself prefer a more ordered, harmonious society, a society
that is regulated. At the same time we should, where we can, give people
more choice - on schools, on health, on arts, on culture.
'We are now at a stage when we are trying to have new out of bounds markers,
when we are trying to widen the fairways. . . but it's an area where we
would rather be cautious than adventurous.'

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (2): Breaking a high-energy diet is not
easy - The Economy
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MANY Singaporeans, led by nervous stock market speculators, have become more
gloomy this year about the country's economy than the economic fundamentals
themselves appear to warrant.
They justify their fears by recalling the recession of 1985 and 1986, by
reminding themselves of Singapore's dependence on a slow-moving world
economy, and by pointing to the government's latest (and reduced) forecast
for growth of between 4 per cent and 6 per cent this year, compared with 6.7
per cent last year and 8.3 per cent in 1990.
This sense of foreboding is shared neither by foreign businessmen nor by the
government. And it is not reflected in the latest surveys of manufacturing
and service companies on the island, which broadly predict stable business
conditions for the next few months. The important disk drive industry,
troubled last year by falling demand, expects business to improve.
Mr Richard Hu, finance minister, regards the moderation of Singapore's
growth rate as desirable and inevitable as the economy matures. 'There were
clear signs that we had been growing too fast; quite clearly signs that we
were overheating,' he told the Financial Times in an interview.
'We have been looking to get away from an 8-10 per cent growth diet to 5-6
per cent growth,' he said. 'But breaking a high-energy diet is not easy.
Manufacturers and others get used to it.'
Not everyone is going on a diet anyway. Motorola's plant, for example, has
been working seven days a week making pagers and other data products to
supply a rapidly-expanding Asian market and to meet North American demand
which is still growing at 5-7 per cent a year.
Singapore's strategy of marketing itself as a regional service hub focusing
on advanced electronics, aerospace and other high-technology industries, and
farming out labour-intensive work to neighbouring countries such as
Indonesia, shows no sign of faltering. More than 3,000 multinational
companies, attracted by the efficiency of the port, the airport, the
telecommunications network and the rest of the island's infrastructure, have
invested in Singapore, and the government hopes to attract more from Hong
Kong with the approach of Chinese rule there.
Motorola is considering making Singapore its regional headquarters - it
would benefit from tax incentives under the Operational Headquarters
programme - and already uses Singapore government subsidies to train its
research and development engineers to masters degree level.
Unit labour costs may be rising, but as a proportion of product content they
are falling, says Mr Robert Becknell, Far East vice-president responsible
for Motorola's paging and telepoint systems. 'We are evolving into a stage
where labour is a very small part of our total cost,' he says.
'The designs are becoming more sophisticated. The manufacturing process is
becoming highly automated. The people who need to work in the factory must
be of higher and higher educational levels all the time. Technical support
must be better.'
With its well-planned infrastructure and increasing technological
sophistication, Singapore is ahead of its partners in the Association of
South East Asian Nations (Asean) such as Malaysia, Thailand and Indonesia.
But the government is still concerned about Singapore's competitiveness
relative to the other newly-industrialised economies (NIEs) - Taiwan, South
Korea and Hong Kong. Unemployment remains minimal in Singapore, and real
wage growth amounted to 7.6 per cent in 1991, while labour productivity grew
by only 1.5 per cent.
'This marks the third year in a row where real wage growth has exceeded
productivity gains,' Mr Hu said in his budget speech, noting with concern
that the country's unit labour costs in manufacturing rose by 7.5 per cent
compared to the other NIEs. 'This brings our relative competitiveness
position to that in 1982 and 1983,' he said.
Although the strength of the Singapore dollar is partly to blame, the
government is anxious to ensure that its workforce remains competitive and
has increased funding for education and training, and attempted to encourage
foreign companies to set up research and development groups in Singapore.
Singapore has made its name by planning economic development with ruthless
efficiency from the centre and by encouraging foreign companies to invest in
the island. But small companies complain that they have been ignored in
favour of the big multinationals, and Singaporeans are afraid that
over-regulation and prosperity have deprived them of the sort of
entrepreneurs for which Hong Kong is famous.
The cautionary characteristic of Singaporean business has blunted the
government's attempts to persuade local businesses to invest surplus capital
abroad, although Singaporean traders and investors have started to make
inroads in Cambodia and Vietnam.
For the energetic Mr Philip Yeo, chairman of the Economic Development Board,
Singapore has simply become a victim of its own success.
'The more you educate a man the more risk-averse he is,' he says, suggesting
that the best way to encourage the entrepreneurial spirit is to train too
many people or to bring them into the country from outside.
'If PhDs have no job they start doing something. Entrepreneurship comes from
adversity,' says Mr Yeo. 'So long as we have full employment in Singapore,
there's no entrepreneurship. . . That's the disadvantage of Singapore. We've
done too good a job.'

FT  01 JUN 92 / Survey of Singapore (4): Political maturity needed - Foreign
Affairs
</HEADLINE>

The lessons for small nations are written large in the history books.
Kuwait, Croatia, Sri Lanka, Cyprus. The roll call of lost independence,
civil war, foreign domination, even worse. And Singapore? This rich,
satisfied society of ours? Can we expect it all to last forever? SINGAPORE'S
anxious perception of itself as a rich but vulnerable mini-state among
neighbouring giants is clear from the words of the government newspaper
advertisement above. The text goes on to warn against complacency and to
emphasise the need for vigilant armed forces and compulsory national
service. Singapore's achievements, the advertisement says, are 'worth a few
days' mud and sweat'.
The government went out of its way to underline that message in February by
commemorating the 50th anniversary of the ignominious British surrender to
Japan's invading army, allowing the older generation of Singaporeans to
remind the young both of the atrocities committed during the Japanese
occupation and of the dangers of unreadiness.
With its Israeli-style strategy of 'Total Defence', involving a core of
professional servicemen and a pool of reservists, Singapore is immeasurably
better equipped than Kuwait to resist an invader. But like Kuwait, Singapore
knows that small countries sometimes need skilful foreign policies and
powerful friends from far away.
For all its hawkish anti-communism, Singapore therefore viewed the end of
the Cold War and the partial American retreat from the western Pacific with
concern, fearing that a military vacuum would eventually encourage regional
powers such as Japan and China to flex their muscles.
Singapore concluded that it would benefit from a closer military
relationship with the US, although it had to tread carefully to avoid
provoking anti-western rhetoric in Malaysia or Indonesia.
In November 1990, the US and Singapore signed a memorandum of understanding
allowing US forces limited access to Singapore's military facilities. In
January this year, US President George Bush announced plans to extend that
agreement by moving a naval logistics unit for the US Seventh Fleet to
Singapore from the Philippines, where the Subic Bay US naval base is about
to close.
Both sides have taken pains to play down the move, insisting that it falls
under the provisions of the 1990 memorandum. The US says only 135 staff are
assigned to the unit, known as Commander Task Force 73, and Mr Goh Chok
Tong, the Singapore Prime Minister, said at the summit of the Association of
South East Asian Nations (Asean) in January: 'There's no need for anybody to
be alarmed.'
Brig-Gen Lee Hsien Loong, deputy prime minister and minister for trade and
industry, spelt out Singapore's worries about Washington's re-evaluation of
its role in Asia in a speech to foreign journalists in February.
'As against the cold war tensions, the new superpower alignment is
incomparably a change for the better,' he said. 'But we cannot assume that
things will automatically work out right for our region. A smooth evolution
from the current state of affairs is necessary, to give the region time to
adjust and find a new equilibrium. This will avoid tensions which would
otherwise put off investors, divert resources and hinder growth.'
Sure-footed on economic affairs and on the part to be played by the
superpowers in south-east Asia, Singaporean diplomacy has proved slow to
respond to the violence in Burma, despite Singapore's repeated statements
about the importance of regional stability for economic development.
The six-nation Asean summit, held in Singapore, reached agreement on mutual
tariff reductions leading to an Asean free trade area, but ignored the
atrocities being committed by the ruling Burmese military keeping Burma off
the summit's agenda now looks like a hollow victory.
A mere six weeks after Mr Goh answered a question about Burma by saying: 'We
do not interfere, we just have our bilateral contacts', Mr Najib Razak, the
Malaysian defence minister, declared that Asean should take a unified stand
against Burma for mistreating its Moslem minority. Indonesia also expressed
its concern about the flight of Burmese Moslems into Bangladesh.
Singapore, which sells weapons to Burma and acts as a broker for other arms
manufacturers, seems to have been the last Asean country to see that the
flood of refugees from the country and their stories of persecution at the
hands of Burmese troops were bound to be seen as a threat to regional
stability and a provocation for Islamic activists.
The European Community had already begun to take a tougher line on human
rights and environmental issues in its trade negotiations with Asean.
Western officials remain unimpressed by the Singapore argument that the West
is trying to impose its political views on Asia. The issue of basic human
rights, they say, should not be confused with arguments about the relative
merits of different political systems. 'What we're talking about is the UN
charter,' says one Western diplomat in Singapore. 'It's got nothing to do
with democratic institutions.'
Foreign critics believe that Singapore has yet to find the political
maturity to match its economic prowess and its growing international
responsibilities.
At one moment, the Singapore government refuses to confront the issue of its
relations with Burma, declining to comment on the internal affairs of
another country; at the next, Mr Lee Kuan Yew, former Prime Minister and
Senior Minister to Mr Goh, is giving Singaporean journalists a forthright
lesson during a trip to Pakistan on the failings of the adversarial
Pakistani political system.
'There's constant sniping, barrage after barrage,' he told them in Islamabad
last month. 'After the sniping is over, then endless feuding.' True, no
doubt, but not the sort of critical tone which Singapore is yet prepared to
welcome from a foreign visitor commenting on its own affairs.
