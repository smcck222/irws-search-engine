FT  29 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Trader calls for rise in US
wheat area

JUST AS the EC is preparing to boost land set-asides in a reformed Common
Agriculture Policy, Cargill, the giant US grain exporter, is urging the US
government to end acreage reduction for wheat and to even to put some of the
land in the US conservation reserve back into production.
'The US wheat industry is showing all the signs of an industry in trouble,'
Cargill said, in its company bulletin. 'It is evident in the dwindling share
of world wheat markets - down to levels rarely seen since the United States
became a commercial exporter of wheat 30 years ago.'
According to Cargill, the Conservation Reserve Program has taken 11m acres
of formerly productive wheat acreage out of production. With these
constraints full US production is 400m bushels - less than full production
at the start of the 1980s - at a time when world grain usage has grown by
about 3bn bushels in the last 10 years.
'The US simply cannot hold its own by producing less when the world is
consuming more,' said Cargill.
The US Department of Agriculture says non-US wheat and wheat flour
production grew steadily from 1988-89 until last year - from 59.7m tonnes to
71.2m tonnes. The most recent estimates indicate a reduction of wheat
production for 1992-93 from non-US sources to 69.6m tonnes.
Meanwhile, US wheat production has varied over the past four years from
37.6m tonnes to 33.5m tonnes to 28.3m tonnes to 35.7m tonnes. The most
recent US grain report predicted a 32.5m output for the US this year.
Most of American wheat exports over the past six years have been subsidised,
according to Cargill. This has led to 'scrambled market signals' and
confused producers. 'US wheat prices are lower than they would be in an open
market, given that carryover stocks are at their lowest point in decades,'
said the Cargill bulletin.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Price hopes brighten outlook
for Brazilian producer - Paranapanema, the world's biggest tin exporter
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BILL HINCHBERGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PREDICTIONS OF further rises in tin prices are brightening the outlook for
Paranapanema, the world's largest tin exporter and Brazil's largest private
mining company.
Last year, the company posted losses of Dollars 30.6m. The poor showing was
mostly due to its decision to write off, during 1990 and 1991, nearly
Dollars 70m in unpaid accounts payable by the government to its construction
division, said Mr Samuel A. Hanan, director-vice president. Of course,
prices in the region of Dollars 5,500 a tonne for tin, responsible for about
80 per cent of receipts last year, did not help.
Mr Hanan cited several factors to support his expectations of higher tin
prices: lower wild-cat output at Brazil's Bom Futuro mine, the stabilisation
of Chinese production at the 15,000 tonnes a year, and the return of Russia
to the consumer market, with estimated needs of about 8,000 tonnes a year.
He noted that the Russians had approached major international producers for
price quotes, signaling their intention to begin importing again after a two
year hiatus.
Global production is slowed because many mining companies practised
selective extraction during the period of lean prices over the past seven
years, going after high grade deposits, partly to hold down costs. 'Those
high grade deposits are depleted,' said Mr Hanan, 'and it is not easy to
increase production when you are working with lower grades.'
Mr Hanan expects a supply shortfall of 12,000 to 16,000 tonnes this year,
even after adjusting for the release of 12,000 tonnes from strategic
reserves by the US.
Brazilian production should drop from 29,000 tonnes to 25,000 tonnes, with
Paranapanema accounting for about 17,000 tonnes. Brazil gave up little when
it pledged to the Association of Tin Producing Countries, of which it is not
a member, to hold output to 25,000 tonnes in 1992, because it was unlikely
to be able to produce more than that anyway, said Mr Hanan.
Lower yields from wildcat mining at Bom Futuro are primarily responsible for
the lower Brazilian figures. Mr Hanan believes that output there should
reach 8,000 tonnes this year, down from 10,000 tonnes in 1991. The mine
produced 33,000 tonnes as recently as 1989.
Paranapanema is involved in a court battle over rights to Bom Futuro. Ebesa,
a seven-company joint venture headed by Paranapanema, holds the necessary
government permits to operate there, but wild-cat miners have obtained an
injunction to delay start-up. A three-member Supreme Court panel delayed an
expected ruling this month when one of the justices asked for more time to
study the case. The other two justices were prepared to rule in favour of
Ebesa.
A final decision is expected in the coming weeks. If favourable to Ebesa,
the company would be primed to begin operations within two or three months.
While Ebesa's extraction operations are prohibited by the injunction, the
company is carrying out research to re-evaluate the potential of the
open-cast site in the Amazon state of Rondonia. Mr Hanan predicts that
output would remain about the same as the 8,000-10,000 tonnes now extracted
by the wild-cat miners. They extracted 81,500 tonnes between 1987, when
operations began, and last year. Ebesa expects to invest between Dollars 20m
and Dollars 25m in Bom Futuro if it gets the nod from the courts.
Paranapanema plans about Dollars 20m of new investment in Brazil this year,
split between its construction and mining divisions, now united under a
unified management structure, the most evident change after Mr Octavio
Cavalcanti Lacombe bought out his former partner Mr Jose Carlos de Araujo
last month.

Base metals prices fluctuated irregularly during a quiet day on the LME. The
Ascension Day holiday in Europe made for quiet morning trade and the volume
hardly improved when the US opened. Traders said uncertainty over the next
move of the dollar kept consumers on the sidelines. TIN rallied in the
afternoon on shortcovering prompted by the failure of the market to follow
through to losses made earlier in line with a lower Kuala Lumpur market.
ZINC remained a two-tier market with covering against tight nearby delivery
dates pushing the premium for cash metal to Dollars 142 a tonne from
Wednesday's Dollars 131. But there was little enthusiasm to buy forward
metal. COPPER continued to find solid support on any dip to Dollars 2,230 a
tonne. ALUMINIUM remained under pressure from liquidation and appeared to be
headed for a test of the bottom end of the Dollars 1,320-Dollars 1,330
support band for three-month metal. GOLD and SILVER prices slipped lower in
thin European trade in line with the New York market. The gold price ended
Dollars 1.65 lower at Dollars 337.10 a troy ounce while silver lost 3 cents
at 408 cents an ounce. But PLATINUM moved higher to test resistance just
below Dollars 370 an ounce.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee delegates under pressure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESSURE on coffee producers to come up with firm proposals for measures
to support world prices mounted yesterday as the markets retreated in both
London and New York.
The producers, who today end a three-day meeting at the London headquarters
of the International Coffee Organisation, have been widely expected to reach
agreement on a course of action that could be put before consumers at a full
meeting of the ICO at the end of next month. Yesterday analysts felt that a
consensus would be reached, but that it would be couched in vague terms.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures brokers, said that
the producers would have to come up with concrete proposals to stop the
markets turning bearish again. Mr Peter Kettle, of ED &amp; F. Man, said the
producers needed to have specific figures to put before the consumers.
London's July robusta contract closed at Dollars 725 a tonne, down Dollars
10, while New York's nearby arabica contract was off more than 1 cent at
62.90 cents a lb by midday on trade selling. However, trading was thin as
most of the cash markets in Europe were closed for the Ascension Day
holiday.
Brazil and Colombia, the two biggest producers, last week moved a lot closer
in attitude towards the coffee agreement. However, the National Coffee
Association of the US, the biggest consumer, last week reiterated its strong
support for a continued free market.

FT  29 MAY 92 / The Property Market: Spoilt for choice
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canary Wharf's plunge into administration stems in part from the UK
government's dithering over whether to relocate its civil servants to the
4.5m sq ft development in the London Docklands.
The delay is more than just an illustration of the slow pace of government
decision-making. The Conservative government, which faces considerable
embarrassment over the plight of the Docklands because of its strong
ideological and fiscal support for the region, has been anxious not to
appear to be bailing out a bankrupt developer. For the government, the need
to obtain value-for-money in its choice of office space for Whitehall-based
civil servants has been all important, prompting a careful consideration of
other potential accommodation in the Docklands
Two weeks ago Sir Terence Heiser, permanent secretary at the Department of
the Environment, and a score of his most senior civil servants went on a
tour of the Docklands in search of offices to house some 2,000 civil
servants.
The senior civil servants' visit underlined one of the most remarkable
features about the parlous state of Docklands: the abundance of empty,
modern buildings that are large enough to accommodate an entire government
department.
There are three premises - besides Canary Wharf - on the civil servants'
list of potential new homes for Department of Environment staff. All are
large, audacious schemes.
In the middle of the Isle of Dogs, the half-empty Harbour Exchange is a 1m
sq ft behemoth of dark, mirrored glass. East India Dock, on the eastern edge
of the enterprise zone, is a light, neat edifice totalling 600,000 sq ft.
Thomas More Square, a pale elegant structure on the western fringe of
Docklands, contains 550,000 sq ft of space of which 80,000 sq ft has been
let.
Three out of the four schemes have been built by non-UK developers - as good
a sign as any of overseas developers' more adventurous outlook towards the
Docklands.
East India Dock was developed by the Swedish partnership of NCC and SPP.
Thomas More Square was built by Skanska, the Swedish developers. Canary
Wharf is, of course, the work of Olympia &amp; York, the Canadian developer
which has sought protection from its creditors.
Harbour Exchange has been built by Charter Group, a private UK property
company, which was once one of the most successful Docklands developers,
although it has recently run into difficulties. Like O&amp;Y, Charter Group was
admired by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, former UK prime minister, who wrote the
foreword to one of its marketing publications.
The claims made by the developers are depressingly interchangeable: 'A
magnificent building with facilities unmatched in London'; 'an unrivalled
modern office scheme'; 'the quality of the buildings surpasses that of any
other office accommodation in the capital.'
Most property experts undoubtedly believe the quality of the Canary Wharf
buildings is a cut above other Docklands competitors. And Canary Wharf is
likely to be favoured by the government in its final selection of a new home
for Department of Environment civil servants if a deal is struck with O&amp;Y's
bankers over the Jubilee Line extention. Whichever of the quartet is
selected, the new premises would be a huge improvement on the crumbling hulk
of the Department of the Environment's current offices at Marsham Street in
Victoria.
The four buildings' location and facilities differ substantially. East India
Dock is surrounded by traffic, a housing estate and the Financial Times's
printing plant. Both Canary Wharf and Harbour Exchange are in the heart of
the Isle of Dogs with a reasonable selection of shops nearby. Thomas More
Square, to the east of St Katherine's Dock by the City, is 10 minutes walk
to the nearest tube station.
The government has said that its final decision will rest on value for
money. Canary Wharf's owners are believed to be asking Pounds 15 per sq ft;
the government has been offering only Pounds 13 per sq ft. O&amp;Y's move into
administration could lower asking rents in the area still further.
Arriving at a swift decision over the Department of Environment's new home
has been a prime concern for the government. However, Knight Frank &amp; Rutley,
the government's adviser, has argued it needs more detailed negotiations
before it can come to a conclusion over which is the most suitable site.
Yet the decision to move to the Docklands is by no means cut and dried.
Certainly, the outcome is likely to be jeopardised by the cancellation of
the Jubilee Line extension, following O&amp;Y's move into administration.
One alternative for the government would be to consider using those central
London premises made vacant by the relocation of civil servants from other
departments. 'There is a possibility that the government could take the
option of using the existing government estate,' says Mr Michael Soames of
Knight Frank &amp; Rutley.
The Department of Transport, which shares the Marsham Street premises with
the Department of Environment, is undertaking separate reviews of its
relocation needs and is thought to be unwilling to make any rapid decision
to move staff to the Docklands.
Civil servants would welcome any proposal that avoids the Docklands. Many
staff are incensed by the prospect of being sent to an area that has been
largely spurned by the private sector. The civil servants' unions are
seriously concerned about the impact on staff of splitting up the
department, longer journeys to work and the relative shortage of facilities
in the Docklands.
'The effect on staff morale will be devastating,' says Mr John Rouse of the
First Division Association. Mr John Delaney of the National Union of Civil
and Public Servants goes further. 'It could well lead to industrial action,'
he says.

FT  29 MAY 92 / The Property Market: Signs of stability
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The commercial property market is showing some signs of stabilising,
according to the April figures from the Investment Property Databank, an
independent research group.
Property yields remained static at an all-time high of 9.7 per cent and the
total return for the month was positive at 0.2 per cent. This indicates that
high income returns are counteracting the negative impact of capital value
decline, says IPD.
Rental values continued to fall in all sectors, although the rate of decline
is showing some signs of slowing for the first time this year.
The figures for the year to April still show an improvement in total return,
which now stands at 1.8 per cent. In spite of a slight recovery in its long
term performance, the office sector continues to depress all property
returns with a negative impact of -13.4 per cent.
The return from the retail sector of 0.5 per cent outperformed that of
industrials at 0.3 per cent.
The capital and rental growth measures for industrial property declined by
half a point in April but total return crept back up to 0.3 per cent,
following a sudden downturn in February.
In the long term, industrial property maintains its position as the market
leader, with a total return of 8.4 per cent for the year to April, two
percentage points above the annual return for retails.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Coventry Building Society in
Pibs issue
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COVENTRY Building Society yesterday became the latest UK mutual savings
institution to raise capital through an issue of permanent interest bearing
shares (Pibs).
The deal comes amid growing concern that Pibs have been sold to retail
investors without a full understanding of the risks of holding such undated,
deeply subordinated, fixed interest securities - with unproven secondary
market liquidity.
Yesterday's Pounds 40m issue, lead managed by Kleinwort Benson, was the
eighth by a UK building society. The market now amounts to Pounds 460m
outstanding, but remains only a fraction its potential size.
If the top 20 building societies were to issue the maximum allowed by the
Building Societies Commission, the industry regulator, the market could
reach Pounds 4.4bn.
The Coventry paper carries a 12 1/8 per cent coupon and was re-offered to
investors at a fixed price of 100.749. At this level the paper yields 12.04
per cent, or 3.25 per cent more than long-dated UK government bonds.
Earlier Pibs issues have already offered holders a handsome capital gain as
the yield spread over UK government bonds has narrowed.
For example, the first Pounds 75m issue from the Leeds Permanent Building
Society was launched in June last year at a yield spread of 3.5 per cent
over long-dated gilts. It now trades at a spread of around 2.5 per cent.
The narrowing of yield spread is partly attributable to increased buying of
Pibs by retail investors. Building societies have taken advantage of this
interest by issuing Pibs in Pounds 1,000 denominations, the smallest face
value allowed by the Commission, to appeal to retail buyers.
Kleinwort Benson said yesterday that around 50 per cent of the Coventry
issue had been placed with retail investors.
But the commission is concerned that Pibs may be sold to individuals unaware
of the risks, despite an explicit list of risk factors in the offering
documents.  It has suggested the minimum denomination should be Pounds
10,000 to discourage unsophisticated investors from buying Pibs.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: British Gas may lose triple-A
rating in Moody's review
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS, one of the most active UK issuers in the eurobond market, could
be set to lose its cherished triple-A credit rating following a decision by
Moody's Investors Service to put it under review for possible downgrade.
The decision leaves BT and Marks and Spencer as the only UK companies with
unquestioned triple-A ratings from both agencies, along with Anglo-Dutch
groups Royal Dutch/Shell and Unilever.
The review, which affects some Pounds 3.6bn of long-term debt, reflects
pressure put on British Gas by Ofgas, the UK gas industry regulator.
This has raised the prospect of greater competition in the UK's industrial
and commercial markets, and put pressure on the company's prices in the
domestic gas market, Moody's said.
Also, the rating agency said it would 'review British Gas' investment plans
in exploration and production and international operations, to assess the
investment requirement, and any potential shift in the balance of group
earnings and consequent volatility.'
British Gas's triple-A rating from rival rating agency Standard &amp; Poor's
remains unquestioned. According to S&amp;P, companies with triple-A ratings pay
around a fifth of a percentage point less when raising money in the
Euromarkets than the next best credits.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Repsol may stretch bond issue
to Pta50bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MADRID
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A Pta25bn (Dollars 250m) convertible bond offering by Repsol, Spain's
state-controlled oil, gas and chemicals group, has been oversubscribed and
the corporation will extend the issue to Pta50bn.
The investor response to the three-year, 10 per cent bonds is likely to
encourage Repsol into making an international placement of shares for
institutional investors this autumn.
Repsol officials say that the placement is under consideration but that no
decision has yet been made. In 1989 Repsol raised Pta130bn when the state
sold a 26.5 per cent stake in the group.
The convertible bonds were priced at Pta10,000 and investors were limited to
buying a maximum of 800 for Pta8m. Officials believe that the average
investment has been some Pta200,000. Most of the bond holders are expected
to convert at the first opportunity, which will be in the last week of
September, in order to take advantage of an 8 per cent discount on the share
price.
Should all the Pta50bn worth of bonds be converted to shares, the state
holding in Repsol will be reduced by about 6 per cent 58.4 per cent. Repsol
could therefore place a further 8 per cent of itself and still comply with
its charter, which demands majority public ownership.
An 8 per cent shareholding in Repsol has a stock market value of Pta75bn.
However, legislation before parliament is due to abolish the ruling on
majority public ownership. Mr Oscar Fanjul, the group's chairman, has
indicated he would welcome that.
The government is understood to favour privatisations in order to reduce the
budget deficit in accordance with Spain's convergence plan for economic and
monetary union within Europe.
Spain has disclosed capital market expansion plans in an attempt to
diversify the sources and lengthen the maturity of government debt, Reuter
reports from Madrid. Treasury officials aim to issue securities in the
European Community's Ecu currency, to open up the market in 'matador'
peseta-denominated, foreign bonds, and to ease the tax burden borne by
foreign investors.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Canadian banks cling to a
raft of reforms - Fundamental changes to the country's financial services
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Canada's big banks have for years been looking forward to next Monday in the
hope that the raft of financial service reforms which take effect that day
would once and for all free them to storm into the insurance and fiduciary
services businesses.
But far from rejoicing, the banks are hopping mad. While they will still be
allowed for the first time to own insurance and trust companies, vigorous
lobbying by the insurance industry persuaded the federal government at the
last moment to tighten curbs on the banks' ability to market insurance
policies.
So angry are the banks that at least two of their chairmen, Mr Allan Taylor,
of Royal Bank of Canada, and Mr Richard Thomson, of Toronto-Dominion, fired
off letters of protest to Mr Brian Mulroney, the prime minister.
Despite the government's last-minute change of heart, the reforms are
certain to accelerate fundamental changes in Canada's financial services
industry. They are unlikely to discourage most of the banks from wading into
insurance, and are expected to spur numerous acquisitions and alliances
involving different types of financial institution.
Some hard-pressed mutual insurers are expected to seek extra capital by
converting into shareholder-owned institutions. The trust industry is likely
to shrink as banks and their new trust subsidiaries become more active in
fiduciary services.
The new legislation, consisting of four Acts with 1,300 pages, has been six
years in the making. It was conceived as Canada's response to the headlong
deregulation of financial services throughout the world. As the precise
functions of each type of financial institution grew more fuzzy, regulators
could no longer maintain the traditional distance between the four pillars
of Canada's financial services industry - banks, trust companies, insurers
and securities firms.
The first legal barriers were broken in 1987 when outsiders were allowed to
invest in the securities firms. All six now own securities subsidiaries,
including some of the biggest brokerage firms in the country.
The banks have for years been itching to use their vast branch and
automated-teller networks as a springboard for marketing insurance policies.
Royal Bank of Canada estimates that while Canadians see their insurance
broker less than twice annually, they deal with their bank about 36 times a
year.
Banks, insurers and trust companies have spent the past two years gearing up
for the changes which take effect on June 1. All the banks have either
bought trust companies or set up new trust subsidiaries, allowing them to
expand into such fields as corporate custodial services, and estates
administration.
Anticipating the reforms, Royal Bank of Canada, Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, Bank of Nova Scotia and Toronto-Dominion Bank have either forged
marketing alliances with insurance companies, or started setting up their
own insurance businesses.
Non-bank institutions have also been busy protecting their flanks. Manulife
Financial has bought several small trust companies and recently gave notice
that it wants to start a bank. Canada Trust - the country's strongest trust
company - has formed a joint insurance venture with Colonia Life.
The last-minute changes, contained in regulations under the Bank Act, were
made after bitter complaints from insurance brokers, supported by many
underwriters, that their livelihood was in danger. For once, the banks were
outmanoeuvred in political lobbying.
While banks will be allowed to buy insurance companies, they will now be
barred from providing their new subsidiaries with any information on their
banking customers.
The regulations also prohibit them from referring their customers to
specific insurance companies or brokers. Any promotion of an insurance
product will have to be directed at the bank's entire customer base or all
its credit card holders. No promotion or selling of insurance will be
allowed within a bank branch.
The tightened curbs are an inconvenience not only to the banks, but also
some insurers which have hitched themselves to the banks' wagon. North
American Life, for instance, bought a direct-marketing business in late-1990
which sells insurance policies to carefully targeted customers of three
different banks.
Mr Cam Hall, North American's director in charge of this business, says that
'the direct marketing of insurance products when you can't target-market is
difficult to do cost efficiently'.
However, the new curbs are unlikely to turn the banks away from the
insurance business. 'We still expect them to try and sell insurance on an
untargeted basis,' says Mr Greg Fast, partner at Madden Fast &amp; Associates, a
Toronto financial services consultancy.
The banks, which are by far the most powerful players in Canada's financial
services industry, have a history of finding the smallest openings in
regulatory barriers, and then gradually prising them open.
It would be out of character if they did not spend the next few years
probing for every loophole they can find until they become the force they
want to be in the insurance and trust markets.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Japan's life insurers resent
role as bad guys / Outlining the effects of the Tokyo stock market collapse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The collapse of the Tokyo stock market has had a humbling effect on Japanese
life assurance companies, once among the most formidable investors in
domestic and international markets.
With unrealised gains on stock holdings eroded, life assurers, which had
assets of Y140,000bn (Dollars 1,082bn) at the start of the year, are more
cautious about investment.
Nippon Life, the industry leader, claims that it will only allocate up to 5
per cent of new money to the stock market, and will try to reduce overall
exposure.
The stock and bond markets stumbled on rumours that insurance companies were
selling what used to be long term holdings.
'We now seem to be the bad guys of the financial markets. . . Everybody is
blaming life insurance companies for the decline in the stock, bond and real
estate markets,' says Mr Hideo Kato, manager of finance and investment
planning at Sumitomo Life.
Mr Shigeyuki Araki, manager of investment planning at Dai-Ichi Life, denies
allegations that insurance companies are selling off long-term holdings.
However, with unrealised gains on stock holdings down by as much as 60 to 70
per cent at the leading life assurers, insurance companies are
understandably reluctant buyers of the Tokyo market.
Allocation to foreign bonds, which carry foreign exchange risk, are also
being reduced sharply.
The life companies, instead, want to increase corporate loans, including
subordinated loans to banks.
However, loan growth to corporations has been relatively slow, with industry
postponing capital spending.
One reason behind the shift to lower risk investment is the liberalisation
of insurance dividends and policy fees, where the cartel influenced payouts
to policy holders are to be freed.
That may happen as early as next year. Until now, the life industry has been
cushioned by substantial hidden assets. With this buffer reduced, and
dividends directly reflecting return on investments, the life companies are
being forced to make more rational investment choices.
The sharp fall in the Tokyo stock market will affect policy dividends this
year. Japanese life insurers are required to pay policyholders out of
income, but as gains on tokkin, or specified money trusts, and investment
trusts are regarded as income rather than capital gains, policyholders will
bear the brunt of the stock market crash. Mr Araki expects that life
assurers will be forced to lower dividends by at least 0.25 per cent.
A fall in dividends may affect the already slowing asset growth at the life
insurers. Last fiscal year, assets at the leading eight companies, which
surged by 15 to 20 per cent at the peak of the mid-80s, grew by 8.4 per cent
to Y110,000bn.
Interest rate deregulation has caused Japanese investors to regard insurance
policies as savings. Life insurers cannot now take long term funds for
granted and will have to anticipate large fund shifts on interest rate
movements.
The problems among smaller life insurers are severe. Many small companies
face heavy losses on stock investments, and analysts suggest that some are
drawing on reserves to maintain a dividend payment.
Free competition in one of Japan's most tightly regulated financial
industries may force the weaker life companies to the wall. Bail-outs by
larger life assurers may be on the horizon.

Ecu1bn

<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Parliament hopes to raise Ecu1bn from the international capital
markets to pay for its new Parliament Chamber, offices and secretariat in
Brussels.
The funds will be used to pay for three separate buildings which are already
under construction: the Parliament Chamber building, due to be completed by
the end of this year, and the Parliament offices and secretariat, due to be
completed within two years.
The form of the funding has not been decided yet, according to Richard
Haycocks of Ernst &amp; Young, financial adviser to the European Parliament and
to Societe Espace Leopold, the promoters of the building project.
'We are looking for an innovative structure at the lowest possible cost to
the borrower' said Mr Haycocks, adding that the borrowing could take the
form of a syndicated loan or international bond issue.
In the case of a bond issue, a special purpose vehicle would be set up to
own the buildings and act as the official borrower. The borrower would have
a Triple-A rating. About 25 international banks have been invited to tender
for the role of lead manager before Monday's deadline.
The signing of the lease with the European Parliament in January was
regarded in Brussels as an important victory for the city in the continuing
war of attrition with France over where to hold the monthly sessions of the
European Parliament.
Espace Leopold contains a 1,000-seat 'hemicycle' which would be suitable for
the full debates of the 518-strong Parliament, even taking into account
possible expansion of the Community.
The formal one-week sessions are currently held in Strasbourg, although for
the rest of the month the Euro-MPs attend committee meetings and conduct all
their business from Brussels.

DEMAND for paper and packaging products is expected to increase in 1992,
according to International Paper, AP-DJ reports from New York.
At its annual conference, the company said that it expects demand for
bleached packaging board to grow by 2 per cent per year until 1995. By the
end of 1995, about 670,000 tons will have been added to the 1991 capacity
base; about 70 per cent of which will come from the US.
Worldwide demand for chemical market pulp is expected to increase this year
by between 4 and 5 per cent. Although new capacity will be available,
International Paper looks for gradual improvement in operating rates during
1992 to 1995.

TATA Iron and Steel (Tisco), India's largest privately held company and the
flagship of the Tata group of companies, announced that Mr Russi Mody would
step down as chief executive on July 22, Reuter reports from Bombay.
Mr JJ Irani, his deputy, will take over as managing director. Mr Mody, 74,
will continue as chairman and also oversee Tisco's overseas ventures. 'In
view of the importance of globalisation of the company, the board required
Mody to continue to head its overseas development, including exports and
imports,' the company said.
In the year to end-March, exports jumped 117 per cent to Rs4.49bn (Dollars
167m), from Rs2.07bn.
The company added that Tisco would launch a Dollars 100m Eurobond issue in
the third quarter of 1992. It said it also proposed to launch a rights
equity issue in late June in the domestic stock markets, but did not give
details.
Tata is a company in transition, writes RC Murthy. Mr J. RD Tata retired
from Tata and Sons, the holding company, a couple of years ago, naming Mr
Ratan Tata as his successor as group head.
Mr Mody's move marks the first significant success of Mr Ratan Tata to
tighten his grip on the group.
Analysts say Mr Mody may soon leave Tisco.

<TEXT>
JANOME Sewing Machine, the Japanese company entangled in the collapse of a
stock speculator group, reported an after-tax loss of Y24.3bn (Dollars
186.9m) following the liquidation of two affiliates and the restructuring of
its debts.
Strong overseas demand for sewing machines pushed sales for the year 3.4 per
cent higher to Y81.6bn, but pre-tax profit fell 39.3 per cent to Y1.14bn.
Sales for the current year are expected to remain at around Y82bn, with
pre-tax profit forecast to fall to Y500m.
The Janome group is still negotiating with creditors over the fate of
Y235.5bn in debt inherited through its dealings with Koshin, the stock
speculator group, and Nanatomi, a property developer, both of which have
collapsed in the past two years.
Janome, the second largest Japanese sewing machine maker, has received
several managers from Kyowa Saitama Bank, which has been negotiating with
the manufacturer's other creditors in an attempt to buy time on the
repayment of outstanding debt.
Janome is expected to sell some of its extensive land holdings, though it is
keen to delay the sales until a recovery in the weak property market.

EQUITABLE Life Assurance, one of the largest US insurance companies,
reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 13m during the first quarter of 1992,
compared with a loss of Dollars 14.6m in the same period a year earlier,
according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The life insurer, currently converting from mutual to shareholder-owned
status, added that improvements in its operating performance would depend on
the company's ability to improve returns from certain classes of general
account investment assets.
Surrenders and withdrawals in the first quarter were Dollars 571.4m, down
15.7 per cent on the first three months of 1991. Surrenders in 1991 overall
totalled Dollars 2.39bn, up 37 per cent on the previous year.
Pre-tax profits from continuing operations during the first quarter totalled
Dollars 25.3m, against Dollars 53.3m a year earlier.
Equitable said that this reflected decreased results from the individual
insurance and annuities segment.

<TEXT>
VARITY Corp, the loss-making international farm equipment, automotive and
industrial machinery group, came close to breaking even in the first
quarter, thanks to a 21 per cent boost in sales, higher margins and foreign
currency gains.
The net loss narrowed to USDollars 2.4m, or 28 cents a share, in the three
months to April 30, from Dollars 37.3m, or Dollars 1.67 a share, a year
earlier. Revenues climbed to Dollars 823m from Dollars 681.5m.
The biggest improvement was at Kelsey-Hayes, the Michigan-based automotive
parts maker, whose sales climbed by almost a third to Dollars 389m, with
operating profit doubling to Dollars 31m. Higher sales of anti-lock braking
systems contributed to the increase.
Varity acquired Kelsey-Hayes less than three years ago, but automotive
products now account for 47 per cent of the parent's sales and more than
two-thirds of operating profits.
Operating income of the Perkins diesel engine group climbed by 29 per cent,
while Massey-Ferguson, the farm machinery maker, broke even, against a
Dollars 9m loss last year.
However, Pacoma, a German hydraulic systems subsidiary, remains in the red,
with a Dollars 1m first-quarter loss. Varity is rumoured to be looking for a
buyer for Pacoma.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman, predicted a continued improvement, no matter what
the economic climate.
Varity, which moved its head office last year from Toronto to Buffalo, New
York, has substantially cut its workforce in recent years as part of its
efforts to contain costs.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Nippon Oil slips despite big
gain in net income
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Oil, Japan's largest oil distributor, has reported a 5.9 per cent
fall in pre-tax earnings to Y44.1bn (Dollars 339.2m) due to rising personnel
costs and a decrease in financial income.
Sales fell by 7.5 per cent to Y2.029bn because of price cuts for petroleum
products following the fall in crude oil prices. Net income, however,
increased by 117.8 per cent to Y32.9bn due to the sale of a storage
facility.
Sales volume remained almost unchanged. Although the economic downturn
weakened demand from the industrial sector, sales volumes for gasoline,
kerosene and gas oil increased.
Nippon Oil expects a further drop in pre-tax profits to Y40bn, while net
profit will decline to Y20bn. Sales will be around Y2,000bn.
Nippon Mining, the Japanese nonferrous metal processing and oil refining
group, yesterday reported a 15.5 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to Y15.2bn
for fiscal 1991.
It said that earnings had fallen because of the sluggish performance of its
metals business, which has been affected by low zinc and copper prices and
the high yen.
The mining division will be split off from Nippon Mining in the autumn as
the company prepares to merge its affiliate Kyodo Oil and concentrate on
petroleum refining.
Nippon Mining said the sale of securities added Y5.3bn to the pre-tax
result. Sales dropped 14.6 per cent to Y845.6bn, while net profit rose 12.09
per cent to Y9bn.
It forecast that pre-tax profits would increase to Y21bn in the current
fiscal year as a result of its merger in December with Kyodo Oil, while the
net profit would grow to Y10.5bn. Sales are expected to climb to 1,060bn.

<TEXT>
SAKURA Bank, the large Japanese bank, is leading a rescue of Taiheiyo Bank,
a medium-sized Tokyo-based bank which ran into trouble three years ago with
loans to a property developer.
Sakura will put up around 30 per cent of low-interest loans totalling Y110bn
(Dollars 846m) to be made to Taiheiyo over 10 years. The rest of the funding
will be extended by Fuji Bank, Tokai Bank and Sanwa Bank.
Executives from Sakura and from the Bank of Japan and the Ministry of
Finance will be transferred to Taiheiyo to supervise the bank's
rehabilitation.
The rescue is a classic example of a bail-out of a Japanese financial
institution, with banks and the authorities working together to prevent a
bankruptcy.
The fact that the rescue has taken three years to arrange is a measure of
the difficulty the banks faced in forging a burden-sharing agreement.
Taiheiyo ran into trouble by lending to Mogami Kosan, a property speculating
company, which accumulated around Y100bn in bad and doubtful loans.

<TEXT>
HITACHI, the Japanese electronics company, reported a 37.4 per cent fall in
pre-tax profit to Y128.9bn (Dollars 991.5m) for the year to end-March, and
along with the entire Japanese industry, blamed the decline on weak demand
for semiconductors and computers.
The company said sales had risen 3.6 per cent to Y3,925bn, but noted that
production of chips and computers had been well below capacity, and sales of
consumer electronics had fallen 7 per cent on the previous year.
Japanese electronics companies, which dominate the market for memory chips,
have been particularly bruised by the unexpectedly weak demand for the
present generation of 4Mbit chips.
The industry is still suffering from a two-year downturn in the domestic
audio-visual equipment market.
Hitachi said its capital investment for the current year would be around
Y160bn, down from Y207.5bn, while research and development spending would be
about Y400bn, slightly lower than last year's level of Y411.6bn.
Apart from weak demand, the Japanese electronics industry's ability to
invest has been curbed by the higher cost of capital since the collapse of
the Tokyo stock market.
For the current year, Hitachi is forecasting a slight fall in sales to
Y3,900bn and a further fall in pre-tax profit to Y120bn.

<TEXT>
JAPAN Airlines (JAL), the country's leading international carrier, yesterday
reported a pre-tax loss of Y6bn (Dollars 46.1m) for fiscal 1991 due to a
slump in foreign business travel and rising operating costs.
Meanwhile, All Nippon Airways (ANA), Japan's biggest domestic airline,
announced a pre-tax profit of Y22.4bn, down 11.6 per cent.
JAL, which had a profit of Y24.8bn in fiscal 1990, predicted it would break
even in the current fiscal year, while ANA forecast a slight dip in earnings
to Y22bn.
JAL's loss, which was lower than its earlier prediction of a Y8bn deficit,
reflected an operating loss of Y12.9bn. An improvement in financial items,
including the sale of securities, led to the smaller pre-tax loss.
It was the first loss for JAL since fiscal 1985 when the crash of a JAL 747
in Japan, which killed 520 persons, caused a drop in passenger traffic.
Net losses were narrowed to Y2.9bn, against a profit of Y13.7bn in fiscal
1990, due to the sale of aircraft. JAL will pay an unchanged dividend of Y5
in spite of the loss.
Sales fell by 0.4 per cent to Y1,114bn. International passenger turnover
dropped by 1.5 per cent to Y564.4bn, although passenger traffic rose 5.4 per
cent. The downturn was the result of less business traffic, mainly on the
Japan-Europe routes, as companies cut their travel budgets because of the
recession.
Less profitable tourist traffic, particularly to China and Hawaii, was
responsible for the increase in passengers to 8.3m.
Domestic sales rose by 5.1 per cent to Y265.2bn as JAL expanded routes
within Japan, producing a 3.8 per cent increase in passenger traffic to 14m.
While total sales remained stagnant, operating costs rose by 3.3 per cent to
Y1,275bn due to higher maintenance costs and leasing charges.
JAL expects a net profit of Y3bn, while sales are expected to increase to
Y1,182bn.
ANA blamed its profit drop on higher interest costs following the purchase
of new aircraft and other capital investments, which amounted to Y300bn last
year. Its net financial deficit grew to Y28.7bn from 17.9bn in fiscal 1990.
ANA plans to invest another Y300bn on expanding its flight network this
year. It explained that expanded services led last year to a rise in
turnover for both its domestic and international routes, which boosted total
sales to Y799.2bn, up 9 per cent.
Net income fell by 28.9 per cent to Y7.6bn. The dividend will be unchanged
at Y5.
Sales in the domestic market, where ANA claims a 50 per cent share, rose by
7 per cent to Y651.8bn. International sales increased by 19.2 per cent to
Y116.6bn as ANA continued to expand foreign routes.
It expects that sales will climb by 5.5 per cent to Y843.5bn in the current
fiscal year, although net profit will decline 3.9 per cent to Y7.3bn.

<TEXT>
MALAYSIAN Airline System (MAS) yesterday unveiled a 42 per cent slide in
group pre-tax profit in the year to end-March, AP-DJ reports. MAS also
proposed a rights share issue to raise MDollars 1.75bn (USDollars 694.4m).
Pre-tax profits declined to MDollars 120m from MDollars 206m the previous
year, on revenues ahead to MDollars 3.57bn from MDollars 2.91bn, a rise of
23 per cent.
MAS, whose interim earnings had rebounded from the depressed levels
following the Gulf war, slumped into a MDollars 28.7m operating loss in the
second half of the most recent financial year.
MAS attributed its weak performance to slower-than-anticipated growth in
demand; higher provisions for wage increases; and lower income from aircraft
sales.
The carrier's overall load factor, representing the utilisation of aircraft,
fell 3 percentage points from last year to 65.9 per cent, its lowest level
since 65.1 per cent in 1983.
The load factor's decline is unsettling for analysts because the airline is
pushing ahead with an expanded fleet acquisition programme, under which MAS
plans to buy 72 aircraft in the next five years.
The MDollars 1.75bn rights issue would partly finance the acquisition of 25
new aircraft in this financial year.

NOVELL, the US computer networking software company, reported a 50 per cent
jump in revenues for its second quarter, with earnings up 60 per cent as the
company continued to benefit from rapid growth in network computing.
Net income rose to Dollars 61.3m, or 40 cents a share, from Dollars 38.4m or
26 cents. Revenues for the quarter were Dollars 225m, up from Dollars 150.2m
last time.
In spite of the strong performance, Novell's stock price was down yesterday
morning on news of the results. Wall Street analysts had hoped the company
would outperform their projections.
Novell aimed to expand its sales further by providing operating system
software for networked desktop computers, said Mr Raymond Noorda, chairman,
president and chief executive.
For the first six months net income increased 65 per cent to Dollars 113.5m
from Dollars 68.9m, while income per share was 74 cents, up from 47 cents.
Revenue was Dollars 430m, against Dollars 284.8m in the same period last
year.
Total revenue growth for the half year reflects a 37 per cent rise in sales
of network computing software.
Sales outside the US increased 85 per cent in the second quarter to Dollars
104m. For the first six months of fiscal 1992, international sales were
Dollars 207m, accounting for 48 per cent of total revenue.

HUGHES Aircraft of the US and Victor Co of Japan (JVC) are forming a joint
venture to make video projectors, Reuter reports from Tokyo.
Sales of projection television equipment are expected to take off with the
introduction of advanced television systems in the 1990s.
The new California-based company, called Hughes-JVC Technology, this autumn
will start marketing a professional model of a projection TV, which shines a
video image on a large flat screen.
Additional models will follow next year and a consumer version is due in
1994.
The projectors are based on liquid-crystal light valve technology developed
by Hughes Aircraft, a division of GM Hughes Electronics Corp.
Hughes says it has been working with this technology for 20 years in defence
applications, which account for most of its revenues.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: CIBC hit by CDollars 860m
exposure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce, the biggest lender to Olympia &amp; York,
has written off most of its CDollars 860m (USDollars 723m) exposure to the
ailing property developer.
CIBC, which has taken a hard line in debt-restructuring negotiations with
O&amp;Y, is understood to be among the banks which refused to meet the company's
request for a large new infusion of funds for Canary Wharf, the east London
property development which went into administration yesterday.
As a result of the provision, the bank suffered a loss of CDollars 440m, or
CDollars 2.55 a share, in the three months to April 30, compared with
earnings of CDollars 186m, or 90 cents a share, a year earlier.
CIBC said that despite the big second-quarter loss, it was confident it
would be in the black for fiscal 1992 as a whole. It has no plans to cut its
dividend. The bank earned a record CDollars 811m in the year to October 31,
1991.
About half the CDollars 860m O&amp;Y portfolio was advanced for Canary Wharf,
with the rest split between properties in the US and Canada. The bank said
virtually its entire portfolio of O&amp;Y loans was secured 'in form or
another'.
The decisive write-down is expected to reinforce the bank's determination to
move quickly away from the O&amp;Y issue. Mr Paul Reichmann, O&amp;Y's co-owner and
master strategist, was, until two months ago, a CIBC director.
Mr Donald Fullerton, who retires as CIBC's chairman next week, said the bank
considered the provision sufficient to 'cover a wide range of developments'
and 'to put the O&amp;Y problem behind us'.
The O&amp;Y provision makes up the bulk of a special CDollars 1bn charge against
CIBC's second-quarter earnings. It also includes sour loans to the Goldberg
group in Australia and provision for further losses due to weak business
conditions in North America.

chartered bank
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NATIONAL Bank of Canada, the country's sixth largest chartered bank, says
its loans to Olympia &amp; York Developments and group affiliates totalled
CDollars 473m (USDollars 394.1m) at April 30, writes Robert Gibbens.
The bank has made a CDollars 200m special provision for fiscal 1992 to cover
possible losses. It has also classified CDollars 210m of O&amp;Y loans as
non-performing.
The bank said the exposure included loans to O&amp;Y group affiliates such as
Gulf Canada Resources and Abitibi-Price, as well as loans made earlier this
year for work at Canary Wharf.
The impact of the O&amp;Y provision, and strong competition in domestic markets,
brought a 41 per cent fall in earnings for the second quarter ended April 30
and a 25 per cent decline in the first half of fiscal 1992.
Second-quarter profit was CDollars 29.8m, or 16 cents a share, against
CDollars 50.3m, or 33 cents a share, a year earlier. First-half profit was
CDollars 79.6m, or 48 cents a share, against CDollars 105.6m, or 69 cents, a
year earlier.

will go ahead
</HEADLINE>

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; YORK said yesterday the appointment of an administrator for Canary
Wharf, the property development in east London, should not affect the
restructuring of the Canadian parent company and its other assets in Canada.
Mr David Brown, who heads O&amp;Y's legal team, told a court in Toronto the
Canadian companies had sufficient funds to maintain their operations during
the restructuring.
O&amp;Y revealed in court documents that it expected to spend almost CDollars
17m (USDollars 14.1m) over the next five months on restructuring costs.
Legal and accounting fees alone will make up about two-thirds of the total.
O&amp;Y's Canadian operations were placed under court protection on May 14 under
the Companies' Creditors Arrangements Act. Its US operations were not
affected.
Mr Brown reaffirmed that the company would try, as far as possible, to
separate the restructuring of its businesses in Britain, Canada and the US.
O&amp;Y told the court it had lowered its estimate of its worldwide debt to
CDollars 13.5bn from CDollars 14.9bn. Some CDollars 8.6bn of the total
applies to the Canadian operations.
Various creditors have submitted a total of 19 motions to the court, either
seeking to safeguard their claims to O&amp;Y assets or to carve out various
assets from the CCAA order.
O&amp;Y and its large lenders submitted detailed proposals to the court to
segregate income from the company's various Canadian buildings and
investment holdings. The proposal would involve setting up 32 separate bank
accounts. Balances in each account would be paid out to the creditors in
July, when O&amp;Y is due to file a detailed debt restructuring plan.
Mr Brown said the company was committed to an 'equitable' sharing of funds
raised from asset sales.
The restructuring cost estimates were contained in the first report
submitted by Mr Bernard Wilson, the Price Waterhouse partner acting as
'information officer' between O&amp;Y and the creditors.
Mr Wilson's report provides the first public glimpse into details of O&amp;Y's
operations. It gives detailed projections for all O&amp;Y's Canadian assets, as
well as dividend receipts from its portfolio investments.

SAFFA, the Italian boxboard and packaging company controlled by the Bonomi
family, yesterday reported a 13.8 per cent fall in consolidated group
profits, to L22.4bn (Dollars 18.2m) last year from L26bn in 1990.
The group, which has transformed itself in the past 18 months with the sale
of its paper activities and concentration on the boxboard business, is
paying an unchanged dividend of L420 for ordinary shares and L440 for
savings stock.
Adjusted for disposals, group sales rose by 21 per cent to L655.7bn, while
profits at parent company level went up by 5.9 per cent to L27.1bn.
The company, which is now the second biggest boxboard maker in Europe,
confirmed it wanted to raise its market share by increasing its own
productive capacity and by buying stakes in other manufacturers.
Fiat may restructure its car production, leading to a cut in the workforce,
Mr Giovanni Agnelli, chairman, said yesterday, Reuter reports from Rome.
An Italian newspaper earlier reported that Fiat intended to close its
Chivasso car plant as a cost-cutting move. The closure would not affect
actual car production.

FT  29 MAY 92 / International Company News: Doing business grandfather's way
 -Spain's March family reviewing its investments
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The March family, one of the wealthiest in Spain, sits down every 15 to 20
years to think about where it is and where it is going.
As its latest strategic review draws to a close, the family has announced
the sale of Banco de Progreso, its merchant bank subsidiary. The disposal
will bring the family's war chest for new investments up to more than
Pta70bn (Dollars 687m).
Some hurdles remain on the way to the rich new pastures the March clan is
seeking. The family is still stuck with Uralita, a loss-making industrial
holding. It also has to mould Banco Urquijo, a middle-sized and unexciting
retail bank that it owns, into the vehicle for corporate business that
Progreso has become.
The present minders of the family fortune are the brothers Juan and Carlos
March, the grandchildren of the legendary Juan March, who gave financial
backing to General Franco in the Spanish Civil War. The brothers refer
constantly to 'the way grandfather did things'.
'Grandfather' taught them the value of having money in their pockets, which
means they remain traders of companies rather than long-term, committed
investors. They make a distinction between 'real' cash-flow, meaning money
they can walk away with, and 'false' cash-flow, funds that are locked into
an asset. The value of diversification to spread the risk was another lesson
he taught them.
The sale of Progreso to the Barcelona savings bank, La Caixa - in which it
will buy the 70 per cent the family owns and launch a formal takeover for
the rest - will raise the family some Pta12bn.
There was a similar return three months ago when it disposed of a 15.5 per
cent stake in Signet Corporation, its financial arm in the US. Further
boosting the war chest this year, the family has sold an electricity utility
to Endesa, the state-run power group, for Pta40bn, and it has realised a
further Pta14bn with the sale of its interests in the San Miguel brewery to
the French BSN group.
The scale of the disposal programme is equivalent to the one undertaken by
the two brothers in the mid-1970s. Well-schooled by their grandfather to run
the family empire following the early death of their father, Juan and Carlos
March then pulled out of capital-intensive industries, including nuclear
power stations, and sold Transmediterranea, a large shipping firm.
Because they were able to skip so nimbly in front of other investors and
ahead of recession in the 1970s the brothers' new strategy for the 1990s is
being watched closely by would-be peers in Spain.
There are, however, no real surprises in the investments being eyed. The
four main sectors are distribution, communications, environment -
specifically waste management - and leisure. These are exactly the targets
that Spain's large banking and industrial conglomerates, such as Banco
Bilbao Vizcaya and Banesto, have within their sights.
Where the March group scores, in addition to its 'real' cash-flow and its
tight family ethos, is that it is already well-positioned in these sectors.
Two months ago, using Corporacion Alba, the publicly-quoted holding that it
controls, the family partnered the French Carrefour corporation in a Pta25bn
capital increase for Pryca, a large domestic distribution chain that the
March group set up with Carrefour on the back of the 1970s disposals. The
brothers also intend to increase the family's 15 per cent stake in Canal
Plus, a subscriber television network which they view as a magnificent
business.
The environment and leisure interest are at present centred on the
Mediterranean island of Mallorca, the birthplace of grandfather Juan March
and the home of Banca March, a small banking subsidiary that the brothers
term their only 'sentimental asset'.
The family could increase its minority partnership in a hotel interest that
controls 10,000 beds on the island, and they are bidding for waste disposal
concessions that will keep the waters clean and the tourists coming.
The main thorn in the brothers' side is Uralita, the family-controlled
construction and chemical group which began to haemorrhage badly last year
when its posted losses of Pta521m against 1990 profits of Pta5.9bn.
Uralita, which has been badly hit by the reduced earnings of its PVC
manufacturer, Aiscondel, is the sort of business that the brothers
increasingly dislike. They get nervous about cyclical losses that cannot be
blamed on management and they are averse to 'false', or locked-in,
cash-flows.
Unfortunately for the brothers, potential buyers of their industrial holding
are likely to feel the same way.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: M&amp;G achieves 9.5% improvement to Pounds
19.9m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
M&amp;G, the fund management group, yesterday announced a 9.5 per cent increase
in interim pre-tax profits in a period when it launched two substantial
investment trusts.
The two trusts - Income and Recovery - attracted Pounds 376m of investors
funds.
However, heavy marketing costs of Pounds 10.4m for the launches meant that
the contribution to operating profit from the trusts was just Pounds
600,000.
Funds under management at March 31 were Pounds 8.64bn - down some 4 per cent
from Pounds 9.01bn at September 30 - largely reflecting poorer stock
markets. The FT-A All-Share Index fell 7.4 per cent over the period.
Unit trust sales were poor, with redemptions of Pounds 203m outweighing
sales of Pounds 158m. However, some potential demand may have been diverted
into the investment trust launches, according to Mr Paddy Linaker, managing
director. Total sales of personal equity plans were Pounds 258m of which
Pounds 31m related to unit trusts and Pounds 227m to investment trusts.
Sales of single premium life and pension policies were Pounds 71m, compared
with Pounds 53m in the first period of 1990-91. New annual premiums were
Pounds 6.4m (Pounds 7m).
Group operating profits in the six months to March 31 were Pounds 17m
(Pounds 14.9m) and after reduced interest receivable of Pounds 2.86m (Pounds
3.27m), pre-tax profits were Pounds 19.9m (Pounds 18.2m).
A slightly higher tax charge resulted in earnings per share advancing only
8.5 per cent to 18.27p (16.84p).
The interim dividend goes up from 8.25p to 9p.
COMMENT
If anyone doubted that fund management is a low margin business, they should
look at M&amp;G's figures. Profit from raising Pounds 376m of new investment
trust money was just Pounds 600,000. although the group can look forward to
the management fee on that business for the next decade. There are unlikely
to be any further trust launches in the near future and judging by the first
half, sales of the group's unit trusts are proving a struggle. Perhaps the
recent performance figures have not been good enough; certainly the
recession has hit the group's high-yield/recovery stock-picking style. M&amp;G's
philosophy should come back into fashion as the economy picks up but even so
the shares, on a prospective p/e of 17 on a forecast of Pounds 41.5m, look
high enough for the moment.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: 20% of Wellcome equity expected to be held
in US after Jluy flotation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ADVISERS TO Wellcome, the UK pharmaceuticals group, expect as much as a
fifth of its equity will be held in North America after July's flotation of
up to 50 per cent of its stock.
The company is applying for a 'big board' listing on the New York Stock
Exchange to encourage US investors. Both Glaxo and SmithKline Beecham have
such listings. Their US shareholdings are 27 per cent and 35 per cent
respectively.
The proportion at Wellcome, which is only on the pink sheet and is not
quoted live, is only 2 per cent.
Wellcome is preparing a series of roadshows in Europe and the US, and
possibly the Far East to generate interest in the flotation. The company
believes that after the offer about 5 per cent of the stock will be held in
the Far East and about 5 per cent on the Continent.
Last month Wellcome Trust, the charitable body which owns 73.6 per cent of
Wellcome, was given permission by the Charity Commission to sell up to 417m
shares, reducing its holding in the company to as little as 25 per cent.
The issue could raise more than Pounds 4bn.
Meanwhile, the company announced yesterday it has set up a co-marketing
agreement with Wyeth-Ayerst, a subsidiary of American Home Products, to
promote Zovirax in the US for the treatment of chicken pox.
The move is part of Wellcome's strategy of supplementing its own sales
forces though co-marketing agreements to exploit its marketing weakness. It
has already set up agreements to market Zovirax with Hoechst in Germany,
Sigma Tau in Italy and Sumitomo in Japan.
Wyeth-Ayerst will be responsible for selling the drug directly to
paediatricians, while Wellcome's American subsidiary, Burroughs Wellcome,
will focus on other primary care physicians. Burroughs Wellcome has about
780 sales representatives.
About 3.4m people contract chicken pox in the US each year. Before the
agreement, SG Warburg, the company's broker, estimated additional sales of
Zovirax for chicken pox would be about Pounds 15m by 1994. This assumed 20
per cent of patients would use the drug which costs between Dollars 35 and
Dollars 50 per treatment.
Merck of the US has developed a chicken pox vaccine, but it has not yet been
licenced.
Glaxo, the UK drugs giant, yesterday opened a Pounds 16m research and
development centre at the Madrid high technology park north of the Spanish
capital. The centre will be staffed initially by 75 scientists and
technicians and will eventually have 200.

ATA Selection incurred a pre-tax deficit of Pounds 400,000 in 1991 as losses
of Pounds 590,000 in the discontinued recruitment subsidiary offset a profit
of Pounds 190,000 from financial services.
There were also extraordinary charges of Pounds 521,000 for closure costs,
bringing the overall loss to Pounds 695,000 after a tax credit of Pounds
227,000.
But there were now signs of economic recovery and the remaining financial
services division was expected to improve its performance this year. With
the elimination of losses from the closed recruitment division directors
said they could report a return to profits.
In 1990 the group made a pre-tax profit of Pounds 41,000, comprising a
Pounds 278,000 loss in recruitment and a Pounds 319,000 surplus on the
financial side.
Turnover in 1991 came to Pounds 5.27m (Pounds 6.64m) with financial
accounting for Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 2.64m). Losses per share were 1.09p
(earnings 0.16p) and there is no dividend (interim 1p last time). The
company's shares are traded on the USM.

Falling sales of new cars and losses at four showrooms reduced Caffyns, the
Sussex-based motor group, to little more than break-even last year.
Pre-tax profit fell from Pounds 711,000 to Pounds 63,000 on sales of Pounds
127.8m (Pounds 133.9m) in the year to March 31.
The cost of closing four sites plus their second-half losses led to Pounds
535,000 exceptional costs, set against gains of Pounds 295,000 on property
sales in the first half.
Operating profit of Pounds 1.53m (Pounds 2.46m) only just covered net
interest costs of Pounds 1.47m (Pounds 1.75m). No figures were available for
net debt or gearing.
Although the family-controlled group lost 5.6p per share, against earnings
of 13.9p, the final dividend is maintained at 6.5p to give an unchanged
total of 11.5p, costing Pounds 473,000.

Pounds 4.25m, subject to profit targets over the next two years. Houben made
a pre-tax profit of Pounds 900,000 on turnover of Pounds 8.76m in 1991.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: ABI Leisure shows 9.3% rise to Pounds 1.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRE-TAX profits of ABI Leisure Group, the caravan manufacturer, showed a 9.3
per cent advance to Pounds 1.3m in the six months to February 29.
The outcome compared with Pounds 1.14m last time and came from turnover up
10 per cent, from Pounds 25.5m to Pounds 28.1m.
Mr George Shiels, chairman, said the economic environment remained difficult
but there were a few signs that the all-important economic recovery was
beginning.
The interim dividend is maintained at 1.57p, payable from earnings per share
of 3p (2.6p).

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Expedier defers preference dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EXPEDIER Leisure, the ticketing and box office computer group, yesterday
deferred payment of preference dividends and delayed publication of its
results for the 1991 year pending the outcome of discussions with its
bankers.
The shares fell 2 1/2 p to 6p, some 2p below the price at which the group
was rescued in a 1-for-1 rights issue last November.
Mr Conor O'Brian, chief executive, said trading losses were likely to be
Pounds 3.5m. Losses after exceptional and extraordinary items were expected
to amount to Pounds 6.3m.
The group said it was trying to sell its TV and film production furniture
hire business and planned to sell its sports promotions division to a
management buy-out.
It may also be forced to sell its box office computer systems company (BOCS)
to reduce bank facilities of Pounds 2.93m.
If all these are sold, Expedier would be left with little more than its 50
per cent stake in The Ticketing Group, a joint venture with Wembley.
This venture combines Wembley's Box Office and Keith Prowse ticket retailing
services with Expedier's First Call business.
Expedier's directors said the interest in the Ticketing Group would provide
a firm base for future development.
It is, however, difficult to see the justification for such a small company
maintaining a public quotation.
Mr O'Brian said directors were confident the group's bankers would extend
facilities until the disposals.
Sales volumes at the Ticketing Group were ahead of budget in the first four
months of 1992 and BOCS had been awarded three new contracts this year.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Europa Minerals seeks Pounds 3.97m via
rights
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOLLOWING THE recent boardroom upheaval at Europa Minerals, the UK mining
finance house, the group is dropping a cash-raising plan which would have
involved companies associated with Sir Ron Brierley, the New Zealand
entrepreneur, and is instead recommending a rights issue shares to raise a
net Pounds 3.97m.
The 9-for-4 issue at 5p a share is fully underwritten by Henry Ansbacher.
At a recent special meeting some institutional investors supported moves by
Austmin, a small Australian mining company which is the biggest shareholder
in Europa, to remove Europa's three non-executive directors and replace them
with Mr Guido Staltari and Mr Robert Duffin, both Australians and executive
directors of Austmin.
Europa said yesterday their appointment would add substantially to the
board's knowledge of the Australian mining industry - a large part of the
group's operating assets are in that country.
Mr Duffin said Austmin would fully take up its rights and was partly
sub-underwriting the issue so it expected to increase its present 14.5 per
cent stake in Europa to between 18 per cent and 20 per cent. 'We believe in
Europa and its assets and are putting our hands into our pockets to prove
it.'
With Europa's shares at 4 1/2 p each yesterday, he expected underwriters to
be left with between 40 per cent and 60 per cent of the new shares.
Many of the sub-underwriters were Australian residents or institutions
because, said Mr Duffin, 'there is support for small resource companies
there not available in the UK.' So the Europa board intends to seek a
listing on the Australian Stock Exchange but will keep an office in London
and its London quote.
The cash raised will be used to reduce Europa's bank debt by about Pounds
3.57m and other debts by about Pounds 400,000. Europa's cash flow from
operations at present is not sufficient to meet interest payments and fixed
costs.
Touche Ross has confirmed that, subject to the rights issue becoming
unconditional, it will give an unqualified audit opinion on Europa's
accounts for the year to January 31 1992.
Europa said it would remain a diversified operating and investment group in
the natural resources sector.
The board in future would take a more active role in the management of
Burmine, the Australian gold producer of which Europa owns 41.8 per cent,
and the Preston Coal Company in New South Wales. Previously the board
intended to withdraw from the Preston venture, 50 per cent owned by Europa.
Burmine's initiative to increase gold production to 50,000 troy ounces a
year via a joint venture with Golden Valley Mines, has the strong support of
the Europa board.
Europa will also retain its oil and gas interests which provide it with most
of its cash flow.
The company said it expects to further reduce its operating overheads and
administrative expenditure.
Brokers to the rights issue are Kleinwort Benson Securities and John East
and Partners.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Macdonald Martin Distilleries a wee dram
higher at Pounds 8.6m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOBER Christmas revellers dampened spirits at Macdonald Martin Distilleries,
maker of Glenmorangie and Glen Moray whiskies, which yesterday revealed
profits only Pounds 240,000 higher to Pounds 8.6m for the year to March 31.
Mr David Macdonald, chairman, said a lack of consumer demand during the
vital Christmas period had re-sulted in an overhang of stock last year.
Neverthe-less, he was pleased with the profits progress despite the effects
of the 'deep and persistent recession worldwide'.
The advance had been achieved on sales 7 per cent down at Pounds 31.8m. This
was the result of lower overheads through increased efficiencies, better
deals on raw materials and job losses through natural wastage.
Mr James Fyfe, finance director, said the company had also increased its
share of a declining international malt market during the past 12 months.
International malt whisky volumes fell by 9 per cent, while MMD's shipments
fell by just 4 per cent.
Mr Fyfe said a strong performance in Japan - where sales jumped by 20 per
cent compared to a market decline of 20 per cent - had helped to cushion the
effect of tougher trading in the US. Shipments there were down by 10 per
cent.
In the UK, excise duty and VAT increases combined with recession to depress
sales for the first time in almost 10 years.
Customer demand fell by about 11 per cent in the UK, Mr Fyfe said.
He added that the excess stock had worked its way through the system since
December, although production was being cut by 15 per cent this year.
Blended whiskies - which represent about 500,000 cases a year, compared with
160,000 for malt - were expected to suffer increasing margin pressures due
to lower prices, Mr Fyfe said. Yet MMD had managed to increase overall
margins last year by 2.6 points to 26.9 per cent.
Earnings per A share rose from 39.74p to 41.88p. The final dividend is
raised 10 per cent to 6.6p for a total of 8.8p (8p).

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: AJ Archer suffers 62% fall to Pounds
267,000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMID EXTREMELY difficult trading conditions at the Lloyd's of London
insurance market, AJ Archer Holdings, the listed Lloyd's agency group,
reported a 62 per cent fall in pre-tax profits, from Pounds 708,000 to
Pounds 267,000, in the six months to March 31.
Earnings per share fell to 0.7p (1.9p). The interim dividend is 2.2p
(3.15p).
During the half year agency fees rose to Pounds 1.21m (Pounds 1.19m). but
fees received for winding up - which are no longer receivable by managing
agents - dropped to just Pounds 4,000 (Pounds 137,000).
Operating expenses rose to Pounds 1.17m (Pounds 987,000), principally due to
the inclusion of the costs relating to the Henry G Nicholson members' agency
last year.
Interest receivable also fell - reflecting falling interest rates and less
money on deposit - to Pounds 215,000 (Pounds 373,000).
Archer warned that profitability would be further depressed when the group
reports its results for the full year since profit commission earned from
the 1989 underwriting year and re- ceived since March 31 fell to Pounds
700,000 (Pounds 2.2m).
Of the 10 syndicates managed by the group in 1989 half produced profits and
half losses, with two of the syndicates' losses amounting to less than 1 per
cent of stamp (capital base).
For the 1992 year of account Archer's managed capacity - the amount of
premium income its syndicates are allowed to accept according to Lloyd's
rules - fell from Pounds 330m to Pounds 290m.
The group's members' agency capacity rose to Pounds 24.6m (Pounds 16.8m).

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Enlarged Babcock 7% ahead
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BABCOCK International, the engineering contractor, cushioned itself against
the effects of the UK recession by spreading its activities across a wider
range of industries and expanding its business on the Continent.
Pre-tax profit advanced by 7 per cent to Pounds 50.1m (Pounds 46.7m) on
turnover of Pounds 830m (Pounds 761m) last year. Operating profit went up 12
per cent to Pounds 43.1m (Pounds 38.5m), but net interest income fell to
Pounds 6.5m (Pounds 8.2m) because of falling rates.
At the March 31 year-end, net cash stood at just over Pounds 100m, compared
with Pounds 69.3m. Mr Erik Porter, finance director, said this was 'a bit of
a freak' following a rush of advance payments. The normal level was about
Pounds 60m, of which about half was Babcock's.
The group issued shares during the year to buy a Swedish company and to
strengthen the balance sheet. With the help of Pounds 23m retained profit,
net assets advanced from Pounds 70m to Pounds 102m.
Three of the five divisions improved profitability, including the new
materials handling division formed from Claudius Peters in Germany,
Consilium, the Pounds 21.4m Swedish acquisition, and a UK subsidiary.
Materials handling profit rose 44 per cent to Pounds 7.2m.
including a big flue-gas desulphurisation contract at Drax power station,
improved to Pounds 17.5m (Pounds 15.7m). Construction and process plant
contributed Pounds 12.7m (Pounds 10.5m) after securing more overseas work
and increasing its penetration of the oil, steel and pharmaceuticals
industries.
Facilities management - the Rosyth Royal Dockyard - slipped to Pounds 10.5m
(Pounds 10.7m) because of delays in a submarine refit programme. The only
serious setback came in South Africa, which was Pounds 3m down at Pounds
7.1m following a slump in platinum mining.
The Pounds 14m settlement of a dispute arising from the liquidation of IBH
Holding in Germany, was about Pounds 6m less than Babcock had provided for,
leading to an extraordinary gain of that amount.
After a reduced minority charge of Pounds 2.4m (Pounds 3.2m), but a higher
tax rate, earnings per share rose to 6.94p (6.56p).
A proposed final dividend of 1.9p makes a total of 3.15p (3p).
COMMENT
Babcock's share price, which sunk to 52p before the general election, has
outperformed the FT-A All-Share index by 18 per cent since then and the
re-rating is well deserved. Although it is still suspected of being a
late-cycle group because of some long-term contracts, it has become adept at
casting its net widely for smaller, quicker orders. It says it is not
unhappy that the year-end order book was about Pounds 40m down at Pounds
580m, especially as about Pounds 100m has been added since. Some analysts,
however, remain unconvinced and point to limited recovery potential. It is
true that earnings growth will be restricted this year by falling interest
income, a higher tax charge and increased equity. However, the potential
contributions from Consilium, which made Pounds 500,000 profit in six weeks
last year and from a joint venture with Yorkshire Water bode well, as do the
reasonable prices paid for these businesses. Pre-tax profit is forecast to
reach about Pounds 57m this year, giving an undemanding prospective p/e of
less than 10 on yesterday's close of 69p, supported by a yield of more than
6 per cent.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cost cutting behind 15% advance at Scottish
Power
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTTISH POWER, one of the two large Scottish electricity generation and
supply companies, yesterday reported profits before tax and exceptional
items of Pounds 259.9m for the year to March 31, an increase of 15 per cent.
Turnover was up 11.5 per cent at Pounds .38bn, although unit sales were
slightly lower, reflecting the closure of the Ravenscraig steel works and a
mild winter. Prices rose approximately 6 per cent over the year.
But the main factor behind the improvement in profits was cost cutting.
The company cut some Pounds 13m off its wages bill by losing 770 jobs,
reducing the workforce to just over 8,700. It also cut its fuel bill, which
represents about 60 per cent of costs, by burning cheap oil.
The company also enjoyed some one-off benefits last year. It would normally
have paid tax and dividends for the year to March 1991 this year, but
because it was floated that year, it did not incur these charges.
This meant it had cash to set against its debt, and the net interest charge
fell from Pounds 35.2m to Pounds 21m.
Last year's profit was also depressed by exceptional and extraordinary items
relating to the company's privatisation and restructuring, including
provisions for job losses.
Earnings per share advanced to 25.2p, and a recommended final dividend of
6.75p brings the total to 10.13p.
Net debt fell to Pounds 123.9m compared with Pounds 284m, giving gearing of
18.3 per cent, against 51.4 per cent.
Mr Murray Stuart, formerly chief executive of Berisford International, is to
become chairman in July, when Sir Donald Miller retires.
Mr Ian Preston, chief executive, said he believed the board now had an
excellent mix of experience, and considerable financial expertise.
COMMENT
Scottish Power is a true utility, and as such can do little to excite the
City. Its core business will grow slowly but surely through a mixture of
careful cost-squeezing and unit sales growth. Next year, sales should be up
1.5 per cent, while the Pounds 50m left in the provisions for restructuring
implies that more jobs will go. Fuel costs will also fall next year, when
the Miller gas field comes onstream, providing the company with cheap gas.
In the longer term, it will have to look for additional growth from non-core
businesses. The retail side is doing nicely, with sales up 30 per cent and a
small profit after two acquisitions. Time will tell if more will come from
the infant gas marketing business, or application for a telecoms licence.
Current year forecasts are in a Pounds 265m to Pounds 295m range pre-tax,
giving earnings of between 24.9p and 25.6p, and a prospective p/e between
8.8 and 10.2.

<TEXT>
LLOYDS CHEMISTS, which in March won control of Macarthy with a Pounds 92.5m
bid, has sold one of the acquired subsidiaries for Pounds 5m, writes Jane
Fuller.
Renacare, a maker of renal dialysis fluids, is being purchased by WR Grace,
a North American speciality chemicals company.
Lloyds said Renacare, based near Romford, comprised about 40 per cent of the
Pounds 9m turnover at Macarthy Laboratories, and less than a quarter of its
Pounds 7.6m net assets.
Lloyds was mainly interested in the retailing and drugs distribution parts
of Macarthy, which means there may be one or two other disposals.
Lloyds has bought Millnew, which trades as National Veterinary Supplies, in
a deal worth Pounds 1.88m. NVS was formed in 1989 and operates three
wholesale depots, supplying veterinary practices throughout the UK.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: North West achieves Pounds 230m - Two
privatised water companies report increased annual profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH WEST Water Group, second largest of the privatised water companies,
increased pre-tax profit by 7 per cent to Pounds 230m in the year to March
31.
Turnover rose from Pounds 599m to Pounds 789m, including Pounds 153m from
the process engineering division, built up through nearly Pounds 150m of
acquisitions over the past 18 months. At the pre-tax level, the new division
contributed Pounds 3.7m.
The final dividend is raised to 13.13p, making a total of 19.67p (18p), a 9
per cent increase. On yesterday's closing price of 436 1/2 p, the yield is 6
per cent.
Prices to the consumer were increased by nearly 15 per cent, according to a
formula that added 5 per cent to the inflation rate. This year's rise has
been set at 9 per cent.
The inflation-plus increases take account of a huge capital spending
programme to renovate North West's 70,000 km of pipes and to improve the
system in line with more stringent regulations on water quality and sewage
treatment.
Mr Bob Thian, chief executive, said the estimate for the amount the group
must spend this decade was now about Pounds 5bn, but that did not take
account of work needed to meet higher standards. 'The people who voted
through these standards have not considered the costs,' he said.
Last year, capital spending rose from Pounds 408m to Pounds 512m. This year
it would be well over Pounds 550m and it would peak in 1993-94.
The company went from net cash of Pounds 4.8m to net debt of Pounds 296.4m,
gearing of about 17 per cent which would double this year. Mr Thian said the
group could live with gearing of 60 to 70 per cent.
Net interest costs of Pounds 15.6m compared with income of Pounds 27.9m.
A restructuring charge of Pounds 30.2m (Pounds 32m) was taken above the line
and the charge was expected to fall this year. Mr Steve McAdam, finance
director, said the main element was reducing the head count. The number
employed fell from 6,614 to 5,450 and the average severance payment in the
voluntary redundancy scheme was Pounds 30,000.
Manpower costs fell by 3 per cent to Pounds 81m. Mr McAdam said this was a
12 per cent reduction in real terms because the average pay rise was 9.2 per
cent.
Earnings per share rose by nearly 7 per cent to 57.9p (54.3p). The group
pays no mainstream corporation tax. Irrevocable ACT on dividend payments
amounted to Pounds 23.3m.
Mr Thian said a memorandum of understanding with the industry's regulator
would enable an extra Pounds 360m to be spent on quality and service over a
much shorter period than had been envisaged. When pricing was reviewed in
1995 this would be taken into account and a return of 7 per cent would be
allowed on the investment.
This would limit the reduction in prices that would otherwise have been
imposed to reflect gains in efficiency.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Storehouse reshuffles senior management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID Dworkin, chief executive designate of Storehouse, has wasted little
time in making his influence felt at the retailing conglomerate, which
includes BhS, Mothercare and Habitat.
Yesterday, the company announced a reshuffling of its senior management
which will lead to the departure of Mr Michael Harvey as chairman and chief
executive of Habitat and the promotion of two BhS directors who worked
closely with Mr Dworkin in turning round the clothing and houseware company.
Ms Ann Iverson, BhS's American stores director, who previously worked with
Mr Dworkin at Bonwit Teller, the US fashion chain, has been appointed chief
operating officer at Mothercare, the childrenswear chain which has failed to
exploit its strong market position.
Mr Steve Bedford, human resources director at BhS, will also assume the post
of group development director responsible for integrating managerial and
operational functions across Storehouse's subsidiary companies.
Storehouse said the management at Habitat had been substantially reorganised
over the past few weeks with greater responsibility being devolved to three
operating companies.
Habitat's central management had been reduced - leading to the departure of
Mr Harvey - and the directors of the three operating companies will now
report to Mr David Simons, Storehouse finance director, who will take on
additional responsibilities as Habitat's chairman.
Mr Harvey was on a three-year contract and will receive redundancy pay for
loss of office.
Mr Dworkin will succeed Mr Michael Julien as Storehouse chief executive in
July. See Lex

ALLIED-LYONS, the drinks, food and retailing group, has disposed of 300 pubs
in the latest stage of its compliance with government orders requiring it to
free 2,380 pubs from tied beer supplies, writes Andrew Bolger.
The pubs, mainly in the Midlands and south-east of England, were sold for an
undisclosed amount to Sycamore Taverns, a company formed to operate tenanted
houses only.
Allied has only to dispose of a further 200 pubs to comply with the
government order, bringing its estate down to 4,400 properties. Last week
the group reported that it had reached agreement with the Office of Fair
Trading over the leasing of 734 pubs to Brent Walker, the leisure group.
The properties in the latest agreement were from Tetley Walker in the north
of England, Ansells in the Midlands and Ind Coope Retail and Taylor Walker
in the south-east.
Sycamore Taverns was formed by five senior executives, previously with Grand
Met, Whitbread and Courage.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: South West Water up Pounds 1.8m to Pounds
90m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRICE INCREASES and cost-cutting helped South West Water achieve a 2 per
cent rise to Pounds 90m in pre-tax profits last year, after spending Pounds
172m of a planned Pounds 2bn capital investment programme.
Mr Ken Hill, finance director, said the company had achieved its capital
expenditure target 'on time and on budget'.
Some Pounds 2bn is scheduled to be spent on waste treatment, water supply
and quality before the end of the decade.
About Pounds 600m of the programme will be funded by consumers through
Ofwat-approved price increases of more than 16 per cent last year and 11.5
per cent annually until 1995, when the next regulatory review is due.
Mr Hill said the price increases were likely to continue at a similar level
for a few years after 1995. 'Turnover will show quite dramatic growth both
in price terms and in real terms,' he said.
Mr Keith Court, chairman, said the rises would 'provide a firm base on which
to build the long-term business'.
ment programme was repairing the damage inflicted by 'a century of neglect'
under government ownership. He said customers were already seeing the
benefits of the investment, with no restrictions on water having been
imposed during the recent hot spell.
Capital expenditure for 1992-93 - the fourth year of the programme - was
expected to be about Pounds 215m, with the emphasis on marine sewage
treatment. SWW has provoked some controversy over its plans to release
treated waste into the sea off Cornwall.
Mr Hill said the company intended to concentrate on developing its marine
sewage expertise to expand overseas in the medium to long-term.
Last year's price rises helped turnover advance by 16 per cent to Pounds
166.5m, including Pounds 7.2m from the recently established non-regulated
businesses. However, tight control of costs - which rose by 10 per cent to
Pounds 102.5m - meant that operating profits for the year to March 31 jumped
25 per cent to Pounds 64.2m.
A 30 per cent drop in interest receivable to Pounds 25.9m - the fruits of
the Pounds 266m cash dowry bestowed by the government upon privatisation -
held back growth in pre-tax profits, which advanced by Pounds 1.8m to Pounds
90m. SWW retained a net cash pile of Pounds 150m, said Mr Hill.
After charges of Pounds 9m - due to write-offs on advance corporation tax -
and dividend payments, retained profits actually fell by Pounds 1.7m to
Pounds 54.3m.
Earnings per share rose by 0.3p to 66.1p. The dividend was raised by 1.3p to
14.6p, for a total of 21.7p. The shares fell 9p to close at 437p.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Betacom finance plan could leave Amstrad
with 72% stake
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AMSTRAD, which has interests in computers and satellite dishes, is poised to
take up to 72 per cent of Betacom, the telecommunications equipment
distributor.
Betacom, which is currently trading at a loss, is raising Pounds 8.4m by way
of a share subscription by Amstrad and a rights issue aimed at strengthening
its equity base.
Amstrad is subscribing for 23.95m new ordinary shares in Betacom at 18p per
share. In addition, the rights issue of 23.37m new ordinary shares on a 3
for 4 basis at 18p per share is fully underwritten by Amstrad.
Betacom's shares closed  1/2 p higher yesterday at 18 1/2 p.
Betacom has recently experienced deteriorating trading conditions, lower
sales and higher customer returns. Last year it reported a reduced loss of
Pounds 515,000 (Pounds 2.44m) on sales of Pounds 19.3m (Pounds 18.3m).
Under its current financial circumstances its bank has refused to continue
its support without a significant equity injection.
Amstrad has recently been moving into the telecommunications equipment
business and has announced its intention to market videophones. It took at
29.5 per cent stake in Betacom in February.
It said that rather than see its investment in Betacom acquired for Pounds
1.6m, it had decided to support Betacom's capital increase.
Depending on the outcome of the rights issue, Amstrad could end up with 72
per cent of Betacom's enlarged capital. Its total investment in the company
would amount to Pounds 10.1m.
Furthermore, if the rights issue flops Amstrad, the directors and other
shareholders currently holding over 5 per cent of the company could end up
with in excess of 75 per cent of Betacom, which would lead it to be in
breach of the Stock Exchange's listing requirement that a minimum of 25 per
cent of a company's share capital should be in public hands.

FT  29 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Euro Colour declines to Pounds 46,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
European Colour, a maker of dyestuffs and pigments and paints and varnishes,
yesterday announced pre-tax profits down from Pounds 463,000 to Pounds
46,000 for the year ended March 31 on turnover virtually unchanged at Pounds
13.3m compared with Pounds 13.5m.
Mr John Finchett, chairman, said that recession in one market sector reduced
sales in the second half. Profits, depressed in the first half by
non-recurring expenditure, did not recover in the second half.
After a tax credit of Pounds 54,000 (Pounds 99,000 charge), attributable
profit came through at Pounds 100,000 (Pounds 364,000).
The dividend is held at 0.65p, with a final of 0.4p.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Prospect of collapse keeps Sorrell on top: The man at WPP's
helm inspires mixed feelings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, the international marketing services group, gives a twist to the old
adage that if you owe a bank Dollars 10, that's your problem, but owe it
Dollars 1m and the problem is the bank's.
If, like WPP, you owe your banks Dollars 1bn (Pounds 555m) and you have
almost no assets except creative people, then it is not so much a problem,
more a process of working towards mutually agreed long-term solutions.
WPP is now awaiting final approval from 24 of its 28-bank syndicate for a
recapitalisation plan announced on May 13. The deal is that WPP's bankers
subscribe to a rights issue of Pounds 150m, to be used to eliminate roughly
25 per cent of WPP's debt.
Once the banks have agreed - and only a couple with relatively small
exposure may resist - shareholders will have the right to vote on the
proposal. By July, the banking syndicate could own as much as 55 per cent of
WPP in the planned equity-debt exchange.
Some 55 per cent of a company with a net worth of less than zero hardly
seems attractive. There are least two substantial puzzles to the refinancing
of WPP. Why are the banks not sending in the receivers? And how has Mr
Martin Sorrell, WPP's chief executive, held on to management control?
The sympathetic view of WPP is that it is a nebulous, intangible beast,
totally dependent on the creative drive and persuasive abilities of its
employees. Breaking it up and selling it off would therefore fail to realise
anything like the total debt. If it became known that, for example, Ogilvy &amp;
Mather was up for sale, who would bid anything near the Dollars 864m which
Mr Sorrell paid for it in 1989?
WPP certainly is a giant with feet of clay; its market capitalisation, less
than Pounds 50m, is puny, yet it is still a revenue machine - Pounds 1.2bn
in 1991 - with potential for much more once the recession is over. Ms Lorna
Tilbian, analyst with SG Warburg, also feels that in the present flurry 'it
is easy to overlook the fact that the main companies in the group are still
trading profitably, which is not the case for a lot of others in the
advertising business. If it is possible to fault Martin Sorrell, then the
purchase of Ogilvy &amp; Mather can be seen to have been a mistake. But the
banks then fell over themselves to lend him the money.'
That is part of the reason why Mr Sorrell has managed to stay at the helm.
Another is that he would be a hard act to follow. According to Mr Richard
Dale, analyst with Smith New Court: 'Martin Sorrell is the man who does know
the company better than anyone and it would be difficult to replace him. But
what is necessary and would be welcomed by institutions, and probably the
banks too, would be another senior executive on the board.'
There is no obvious internal candidate to replace Mr Sorrell. Mr David
Ogilvy, WPP's 81-year-old non-executive chairman, spends most of his time in
his chateau in France. Apart from Mr Sorrell, there are only two other
executives on the board.
Mr Sorrell has a reputation for devoting himself to only two things in his
life: his family and WPP. Even his detractors - of whom there are many among
former WPP executives - admire his dedication, first to building the WPP
empire, and now to keeping it from toppling over.
Still, for a man sitting on the top of a heap of 'people' businesses, Mr
Sorrell has a poor reputation when it comes to handling people. An ex-WPP
colleague says: 'He is a very complicated man who has trained himself in
self-control; he tightly controls how he looks, what he does and says.' That
made dealing with him difficult.
Mr Sorrell's strongest card, in talking to the banks, may have been the
argument that if he went, the edifice would quickly crumble. Senior
executives within the main companies - JWT, O&amp;M and the public relations
company Hill and Knowlton - would sniff the chance of management buy-out
possibilities or be tempted away by rivals, once the group's moving spirit
had gone.
Another card in Mr Sorrell's hand has been the bleakness of the outlook for
the industry as a whole. There is no sign that advertising spending will
rapidly pick up this year; 2 per cent worldwide in real terms is the betting
at the moment.
Against this background, the banks' best chance of recovering their money is
to to dig in now, in hope of selling bits of the company over the next five
years. That argues against immediate management changes.
When the recession ends, and advertising revenue starts rising again, the
banks may scent a chance of selling for a reasonable price. At that point,
the debate will re-open about whether large marketing groups add value to
the activities of their subsidiaries - a question on which Mr Sorrell may
find he holds markedly different views to his new majority shareholders.

FT  29 MAY 92 / MEPC warns of downturn at full year: UK property company
reinforces gloom with fall of 13% over six months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, yesterday reinforced the
mood of gloom in the UK property market and hinted that profits for the year
to end September may be lower than they were in the previous 12 months.
'Recent events in the UK property market are unlikely to lead to an early
improvement,' Sir Christopher Benson, MEPC's chairman, warned in a statement
accompanying the half-year report.
'The outlook for the current year is tempered by the virtual elimination of
opportunities to realise trading profits, particularly in the UK, and, with
the receipt of investment income on new lettings delayed due to current
market conditions, it will be difficult to repeat the level of profit
achieved last year.'
MEPC said its rental income in the six months to March increased 6 per cent
to Pounds 158.1m, but after higher finance charges of Pounds 45.7m (Pounds
35.9m) pre-tax prof-its were 13 per cent lower at Pounds 58.6m.
The group does not publish a revised net asset value - one of the most
widely-watched numbers - at the half-way stage.
Earnings per share for the period were 12.4p, compared with 14.2p last time,
while the interim dividend has been maintained at 5.25p.
The company said that eight of the nine UK developments under construction
at the beginning of the year were now complete, but that 'the letting of
developments completed in 1991 and 1992 has been slow, particularly in the
City of London.'
At Alban Gate, the huge City development, MEPC has so far let only 40,000 sq
ft of the 400,000 sq ft available. Outside London, however, the Royal
Victoria Place shopping centre in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, has opened with
'substantial lettings'.
At the last count, about 20 per cent of MEPC's total portfolio was in the
City and 44 per cent in central London.
The group said yesterday that its investment portfolio had produced a '
solid performance'. In the UK, increased rents had been achieved on review
and new rental income was beginning to flow from developments completed last
year, though such increases were offset by sales of investment property.
Vacancies in the investment portfolio fell slightly to 3 per cent, while the
incidence of bad debts was 'not significant'.
MEPC's shares yesterday rose 2p to 355p.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Profits continue to fall at Japanese banks: Bad loans and
higher costs take toll at year-end
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE leading Japanese commercial banks yesterday reported a decline in annual
pre-tax profits for the third year in succession, due to the impact of the
plunge in Tokyo financial markets, an increase in costs and a rise in
write-offs on bad loans.
These effects more than offset a substantial increase in income from lending
operations, which benefited from a sustained decline in interest rates and a
widening in lending margins.
Net business profits - a measure of profits from lending operations -
increased 31.5 per cent to Y1,922bn (Pounds 8.24bn) but pre-tax profits for
11 leading banks fell 14 per cent on a non-consolidated basis to Y1,426bn.
After-tax profits fell 26.9 per cent to Y647.6bn.
The results are in line with Ministry of Finance estimates published a month
ago to reassure investors and financial company managers about the health of
Japanese banks.
Combined bad-debt provisions rose fivefold to Y344.1bn. The levels remain
low in relation to estimates circulating in Tokyo of total bad and doubtful
loans, including loans made to the troubled Japanese property market.
The finance ministry has estimated publicly that the 21 largest Japanese
banks (including the 11 commercial banks) had bad loans of between Y7,000bn
and Y8,000bn at the end of March. This covers loans on which interest has
not been paid for six months or more.
Other estimates have run as high as Y30,000bn and more. However, these
estimates ignore the potential value of collateral.
Japanese banks do not generally write off debts if there is a possibility of
eventually recovering the money - even if that recovery is several years
away. This accounts for the discrepancy between estimates of problem loans
and the actual provisions revealed yesterday.
Three banks made separate provisions for losses arising from fraudulent loan
cases which came to light last year. Fuji Bank set aside Y142.8bn, Tokai
Bank Y49.5bn and Kyowa Saitama Bank Y8.2bn.
Mr Ryuichi Kato, Tokai chairman, resigned his title (though not his board
seat) to take responsibility for the bank's poor performance. Three other
Tokai board members also resigned.
Losses on securities portfolios were 11 times more than in 1990-91 to
Y828.7bn, reflecting continuing stock market weakness.
Because banks count a portion of their stock portfolios as capital the fall
in portfolio values reduced capital reserves. As a result, there was a
deterioration in banks' ratios of capital to assets calculated under Bank
for International Settlements rules. But only Sakura, with a ratio of 7.92
per cent, failed to make the 8 per cent minimum the BIS will bring into
effect next year.
Meanwhile, as the bankers grapple with the problems of past loans and
investments, their efforts to improve returns from current business is
bearing fruit - as shown in the increase in net business profits.
Mitsubishi Bank said the increase was due to a substantial fall in interest
rates coupled to the adoption of an improved system for pricing loans and
better marketing of high-margin consumer loans.
The banks, which are trying to limit asset growth to meet BIS ratios,
restricted loan growth to 2.9 per cent. Loans fell at Sakura by 0.9 per cent
and at the Bank of Tokyo by 1.2 per cent.
Sumitomo Bank kept its place as the most profitable bank, followed by Sanwa
Bank and Fuji. The Bank of Tokyo was the only bank to post an increase in
pre-tax profits, albeit marginal. Sumitomo retained its lead in
international revenues, with the Bank of Tokyo in second place.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday's announcement from Storehouse confirms that the group is
toughening its attitude towards underperforming assets. The appointment of
Habitat's finance director as divisional chairman and chief executive
probably implies the imminent closure of the loss-making US operation. The
French stores have been alone in making a consistent success of the Habitat
concept, so Storehouse would doubtless smile on any bid from its French
management to take control of the rest of the division. If the shares failed
to react, it was doubtless because they are already discounting rather more
than this tinkering at the edges.

FT  29 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Water sector
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The opening brace of water company results provided an object lesson in
practical regulation. South West Water won permission last year from Ofwat
to pass on to consumers some of the costs of additional long-term capital
spending; North West Water has found a neat solution to its unforeseen
requirement for Pounds 360m of extra spending. A deal with Ofwat means its
customers will be spared even bigger price rises, while the company has the
incentive of an agreed 7 per cent real rate of return on the investment.
Perhaps more importantly, the arrangement will be kept separate from the
industry's price review in 1994. That reinforces the impression that the
companies as a group are doing their best to limit Ofwat's ability to
squeeze the price formula. In part that involves judicious control of
profits via restructuring provisions or a greater interest burden. It will
be rather harder to avoid scrutiny of operating margins in the basic water
business which, in the case of the most efficient companies, are creeping
towards 50 per cent. But South West and North West have persuaded Ofwat to
accept a long-term view. Shareholders should not expect the rest of the
sector to enjoy similar treatment.

FT  29 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Thorn EMI
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Thorn's restructuring has been well documented, but the size of the
extraordinary items accompanying broadly unchanged full year profits
yesterday still came as something of a surprise. The company, to be fair, is
scrupulous about taking routine rationalisation costs above the line, has
refused to join the pension accounting bandwagon, and can individually
justify the component parts. A gross charge equivalent to almost 50 per cent
of pre-tax profits nevertheless took some of the shine off an otherwise
resilient performance.
The weakness of Thorn's shares in the last week - in contrast to the
immediate post Virgin euphoria - no doubt owes something to the second
instalment on the rights. It may also reflect the market's uncertainty as to
whether the stock is primarily a defensive or a recovery one. The
improvement in music margins (ex Thames) vividly demonstrates its defensive
appeal, but though US rental volumes now appear to be picking up the UK side
looks set for another tough year. Thorn is solid, well-financed, and clearly
has scope to improve the returns from non-core businesses like lighting and
security. Until the much hyped benefits of the Virgin acquisition start to
show through, however, the shares may struggle to live with a rating 16-17
per cent above the market average.

<TEXT>
The short term impact of the Canary Wharf administration on the likes of
MEPC may well be mildly positive. But it would be unwise to gamble too much
on tenants flocking back from Docklands - or no longer being tempted to go
there - when there is still the distinct long term possibility of a receiver
simply slashing the rents. In the meantime, yesterday's decision by MEPC
merely to maintain its interim dividend emphasises why investors in property
companies are keeping a weather-eye on yields, focusing at least part of
their attention away from the conventional, but increasingly unreliable,
asset value yardstick. With capitalised interest reducing and earlier rent
targets from new developments getting harder to meet, the prospect for
dividend growth over the next two to three years would seem to be limited. A
7.5 per cent yield on the shares at last night's 355p thus seems about
right. The good news is that thanks to investment property sales the company
is on target to maintain the absolute level of net borrowings at the year
end.

FT  29 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Ripples from Docklands
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is an obvious temptation for the stock market to see the initiation of
bankruptcy proceedings against Canary Wharf as something which principally
affects the banking and property sectors. In fact, the travails of the
property market, of which Canary Wharf is a symptom, may turn out to be a
drag on the entire economy, even if the direct effects are difficult to
quantify.
The government's reluctance to assist, for example by financing the
extension of the Jubilee line, says more about the degree to which its
finances are already stretched than about the gravity of the problem.
Unfortunately for Mr Major, his government's inability to bail out the
property sector may even end up making public finances worse.
It will force the banks to take the hit on the chin. There is no immediate
threat to their capital ratios, but provisions are likely to remain high for
at least the next two or three years. So they will not generate nearly
enough retained earnings to meet the level of loan demand generated by even
a fairly modest recovery. Indeed, there is hardly any prospect of banks
disposing of sufficient capital to finance the growth of over 3 per cent
which the government has factored into its budget projections from next year
onwards. The consequence will be continuing deflationary pressure on public
spending.
The best palliative would be a sharp cut in short-term interest rates. This
would not only alleviate the burden for cash-strapped property companies.
Lower rates would also create room for banks to increase their lending
margins, thus providing them with income with which to build up provisions.
As the ERM precludes this route, the prospect is that the pain now emanating
from Docklands will spread widely through the economy for a long time to
come.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Russian managers reluctant to adopt western practices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LEYLA BOULTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MOSCOW
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MANAGERS of Russia's biggest industrial enterprises are supporting moves
towards a market economy but believe it is 'unethical' to adopt western
practices such as mass layoffs and aggressive pricing policies to reach that
goal.
This is one conclusion of the first report into why many senior managers of
enterprises, from arms producers to textile manufacturers, have not
responded to the government's 'shock therapy' to shift Russia from a planned
economy to a free market one.
The report by the Russian Union of Industrialists and Entrepreneurs is based
on opinion polls and interviews involving 200 of Russia's biggest
enterprises. It paints a portrait of an average senior manager who finds it
unethical to charge 'excessive' prices to his friends and to demand payment
from other enterprises which claim they cannot pay.
With debts between enterprises reaching Rbs1,300bn (Pounds 7.2bn), according
to the central bank's latest figures, the report cites a fear among
enterprises that demanding late payments from each other will mean
'everything will stop'.
A reluctance to fire employees explains why a 15 per cent fall in production
for the first quarter of this year has not resulted in a surge in
unemployment. The report notes that the courts and trade unions also deter
enterprises from sacking workers, but many directors feel responsible for
their workforce and hope that the bad times will pass.
It also notes that 80 per cent of managers favour privatisation, in part
because they believe it will be the only way to attract foreign capital.
There is a widespread belief that foreign investors will avoid state-owned
enterprises.
Western-style pricing policies, however, find little favour among the
managers. After the liberalisation of prices in January, enterprises, most
of which are monopoly producers, have tended to raise their prices, until
they cannot sell their goods, rather than cut their costs.
They continue to add to their costs a fixed 25 per cent (the maximum allowed
by the state), plus the new value added tax of 28 per cent which they pass
on to the buyer.

five years in prison and a fine of ADollars 20,000.
The jury took nearly six hours to consider the events surrounding Mr Bond's
part in the rescue of Rothwells merchant bank after the global stock market
crash in October 1987.
Mr Bond denied inducing Mr Brian Coppin, a millionaire insurance broker, to
sub-underwrite a rights issue without revealing that Bond Corp would receive
a ADollars 16m success fee. Mr Bond admitted going to Mr Coppin's home to
complete details of the sub-underwriting, but claimed he was unaware that a
fee would be paid until two weeks later.
Mr Ian Callinan, defending, said Mr Bond was 'a very debased individual'. He
had fallen a long way from the dizzy heights of five years ago, when Bond
Corp was a major international brewing and media group.
Mr Callinan also urged the jury to not to make Mr Bond a scapegoat for the
failure of Rothwells. It collapsed a year after the rescue at a cost of
hundreds of millions of dollars to Western Australian taxpayers.
But the jury accepted the prosecution case that Mr Bond and Mr Laurie
Connell, chairman of Rothwells, agreed the fee before the completion of Mr
Coppin's sub-underwriting agreement.
Mr Bond's lawyers are expected to consider an appeal after he is sentenced.
He was declared bankrupt last month with debts and contingent liabilities of
ADollars 700m. He resigned as chairman of Bond Corp in September 1990, two
days before the group announced a record loss of ADollars 2.2bn. It is now
being restructured.

As fireworks flashed and balloons soared close by London's Canary Wharf
yesterday, overseas visitors may have been prompted to think the Brits at
least take business failures bravely. That, however, would have been the
wrong conclusion.
What the high-jinks marked was not Europe's biggest property development
going under, but the formal launching by Dame Kiri Te Kanawa of the Pounds
70m, twin-hulled liner Radisson Diamond just across the Thames.
Diamond Cruise's 19,000-tonne ship was of course already afloat, having
sailed up from Tilbury overnight for the naming ceremony at Greenwich. The
shipowners' president, Christian Aspegren, said he'd chosen the site, with
Canary Wharf's tower dominating the background, as the place 'where world
time begins and where we are celebrating the beginning of a new time in the
world's cruise industry'.
'It is a great privilege to be on this glorious ship,' declared Dame Kiri as
she christened each of its hulls with a bottle of champagne - a marked
contrast to the bitter cup being drunk over the water.

Venture capital director Stephen Hill permitted himself a small, wry smile
yesterday as news broke that Canary Wharf was going into administration.
Hill, managing director of LICA Development Capital, a 'boutique' venture
capital company, had just dusted down an investment assessment he produced
in 1984 for his then boss Bill Norris, the legendary founder of Control
Data.
The American computer group was thinking of setting up a new UK Business and
Technology Centre where resources and facilities are shared.
Hill's boss was not best pleased by his verdict that the centre would not be
viable in the short term and things would only get worse in future.
The November 1984 report quoted the UK property industry adage that there
are three main ingredients for a successful development: 'location, location
and location'.
Control Data indeed decided not to go ahead and dropped its option on a
development site.
It was later snapped up by none other than Olympia &amp; York - for Canary
Wharf.

Did the Cadbury report say anything about putting staff convenience above
shareholder value?
Sir Adrian Cadbury's review of corporate governance this week happened to
coincide with an announcement from his old stable Cadbury Schweppes that the
sweets and drinks manufacturer is on the move. Having outgrown its corporate
headquarters near Marble Arch - Connaught Place, which it owns - it is
trading up some to Berkeley Square in the heart of Mayfair at a tidy Pounds
55 per square foot.
Challenged about this apparent extravagance in the midst of Britain's
gathering property crisis, the company says it thinks it has an excellent
deal, including an unspecified rent-free period. While it looked 'around the
M25 corridor', it prefers the West End; one of its primary concerns is not
to uproot its staff. It adds that it is looking forward to the big cash flow
boost from the sale of the old building - 'when the market picks up'.

<TEXT>
Britain's high-minded music critics seem to have been caught off-guard, if
not downright disappointed, by the fact that the 76-year-old Frank Sinatra
can still thrill a Royal Albert Hall packed with folk looking for something
more than a trip down memory lane.
Ready to gloat at the dimming of the ol' blue eyes, the critics seemed to
have their worst prejudices vindicated by the presence of banks of autocues,
not to mention an in-ear hearing aid. On his first night in London of this
heavily flagged European tour, Sinatra managed to introduce his wife, seated
in the audience, twice over, and later tried to leave the stage by the wrong
exit.
But even his detractors could not but be awed by the vast stage presence,
and the, as ever, impeccable sense of timing. An ageing voice jarred more in
the spoken asides than when he sang.
Anyone with the temerity to argue Sinatra should have put his feet up long
ago might care to compare his current rendering of 'Witchcraft' with that of
a 1957 recording, re-released on CD - the considerably more youthful
version, bland, even banal, certainly with none of the beguiling quality
that so captivates today.

Where does the world's best known management school look for a leader for
its new publishing venture?
Not to the august experts on its teaching staff, in the case of Harvard
Business School, even though one of them - the famous Rosabeth Moss Kanter -
already edits its flagship publication, the Harvard Business Review.
Having decided to group its disparate publishing activities into a single
enterprise expected to generate Dollars 40m a year in revenue, the school is
importing a publishing professional to run it in the shape of Ruth McMullen
from Wiley. Kanter, a professor of organisational behaviour, will step down
as editor of the review although she becomes vice-chairman of the board of
the new unit.
While her two-year stay in the editorship has been stormy at times, insiders
say the real source of the evident tension is not her management but the
hybrid nature of the product. The bi-monthly review is neither an academic
journal nor a typical business magazine.
Even so, with efforts in train to make it less stuffy and attractive to a
wider public, Kanter's departure may signify Harvard's recognition that
business academics aren't always the best people to run businesses in
practice.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Letter: Views of balance of payments trend in UK too relaxed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr NICHOLAS KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The relaxed attitude displayed by most to the deteriorating trend in
the UK's current account deficit is very worrying. Lex (May 27) was
certainly helpful, therefore, in that it drew attention to the damage that
even a weak recovery is already doing. To suggest, however, that this 'does
not matter in the short term because foreign money is flowing abundantly
into post-election Britain' is little more than a statement of historical
fact, and to suggest in the next sentence that the estimate for invisible
earnings may have to rise is perverse in the extreme - foreign inflows will,
of course, increase the outflow of interest and dividends.
Current account deficits are by definition balanced by capital inflow - all
that is in question is the price demanded through higher interest rates or
currency depreciation. In this sense the UK still has plenty of
'independent' control over monetary policy - interest rates can still be put
up after all.
Whether, when the time comes, the UK authorities will have the nerve to do
this before the market demands it of them remains a moot point.

</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Lee Mallett (Letters, May 19) complained that he found it difficult
to obtain details of the investment performance of pension funds and, if
such performance were more widely reported, then he would find it easier to
pick the fund of his choice.
In fact there is one pension fund whose investment performance he is already
entitled to know about and that is the fund of which he is a member or a
prospective member. The Social Security Act of 1985 requires the trustees to
produce an annual report giving information about, among other things, the
investment performance of their fund.
It is quite true that he is not entitled to similar information about the
funds of other employers but neither is he entitled to join the fund of any
other employer. There are good reasons why employers should be given every
encouragement to provide good pensions for their own employees. It is hard
to think of a single reason why they should be forced to provide pensions
for the employees of their competitors.

FT  29 MAY 92 / France accelerates into the overtaking lane / Examining
evidence that London is falling further behind Paris in its transport
connections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS and WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Londoners spend longer commuting further in more late-running, overcrowded
trains and buses than their Parisian counterparts, and their relative plight
looks set to worsen during the 1990s. Even Paris's notoriously congested
motorway system is to be improved by a network of privately financed
motorways, while 'no change' is the name of the game for London.
Only in buses - where both capitals are progressively privatising their
routes - are the two cities on the same road, to evident advantage.
Those are the findings of a report* comparing transport in the two cities,
to be issued next month. It is the joint work of the London Research Centre,
an independent think tank, and Iaurif, planning institute for the
Ile-de-France regional council, which embraces Paris. Their conclusion, that
London is the poor relation in urban transport, has been reinforced this
week by the insolvency of Canary Wharf, the business development in London's
Docklands to whose success inadequate rail links were a significant
impediment.
In both Paris and London, commuting is the grim lot of a similar share of
the workforce. The proportion of journeys to work made by public transport
is higher in Paris (43 against 37 per cent). But London's more dispersed
residential geography means that its commuters typically travel about a
tenth again as far their Parisian counterparts - offsetting the relative
advantage of London's more far-reaching Underground and suburban Network
SouthEast systems.
Besides that, the honours are with Paris. Its central area rail network is
now far superior to London's: within a comparable central zone the Metro
runs across almost twice as many kilometres as the Underground, and the
average distance between its stations is half that in London. La Defense,
Paris's edge-of-centre business district, has fast suburban-line connections
and gained a Metro link last month. Docklands, its London equivalent, has a
sub-standard railway. An Underground link, through an extended Jubilee line,
has been jeopardised by the failure of Canary Wharf.
Paris also benefits from more express cross-city rail routes: it has three
through lines, with a fourth partially built and a fifth projected.
Thameslink, London's sole equivalent, is infrequent - especially in peak
hours, because of capacity constraints. Another (crossrail) is planned, but
work has yet to start. Forty years after it opened, Heathrow airport still
lacks a fast rail link to the city: a British Rail/British Airports
Authority consortium has permission to build one, but is strapped for cash
and looking for other partners.
It is not just on routes, but on overcrowding, punctuality and frequency,
that London scores poorly. Three facts suffice. Almost a third of the
Underground's network is judged overcrowded in the central zone, compared
with 5 per cent in Paris; 94 per cent of Paris peak hour suburban services
arrived within five minutes of schedule in 1989-90, compared with 83 per
cent in London; central-zone Metro frequencies in Paris range from 1.5 to 4
minutes in peak hours - in London the range is 2.5 to 8 minutes.
'These differences are crucial,' says Mr Caralampo Focas, editor of the
joint study. 'While journey times are not much different, people have to
allow far more time to travel by public transport in London.'
Behind such contrasts lie crucial differences in investment and
organisation. It is not just government largesse: business pays a share of
the cost of Paris's public transport and the RATP city transport authority
raises capital on the bond markets.
Bus and train fares in Paris are only half those in London, and revenue from
passengers and commercial activities accounts for less than half the
spending of Paris's two main public transport providers - RATP and the SNCF
state railways. About half of the rest comes from a payroll tax on
enterprises with more than 10 employees, levied at a rate of 2.2 per cent in
Paris city and half that in the suburbs. Companies are also obliged to
reimburse half the cost of employees' season tickets. By contrast, London's
business makes no contribution to transport spending beyond one-off levies
in exchange for development consents.
Paris is planning similar levies to fund expansion of its roads system for
the region. The Ile-de-France region is about to finalise a 25-year
development plan for the capital which envisages a fourth ring road and at
least five underground motorways which charge tolls. The idea is to copy in
Paris the system of toll motorways crossing the rest of France and to keep
the cost to the taxpayer down. In London, by contrast, there are few
development plans for roads.
'There is a national concern in France to make the Paris transport system
shine,' says Mr Focas. 'It is seen as a facilitator to development, while
terms such as 'making London into a great city' don't appear anywhere.'
The different government structures in the two capitals also help explain
their divergent paths. Central government is the principal player in both
cities: their main transport providers are nationalised industries with
remits set by ministers. In Paris, though, the powerful City government and
the Ile-de-France region - neither with a London equivalent - are powerful
lobbyists for the city's transport needs. They also put money behind their
dreams, footing a large part of the bill for capital spending.
More than a third of the region's 1991 budget of FFr10.6bn (Pounds 1.06bn)
was devoted to transport. The city government spends about FFr2bn on
transport, including roads, parking and a contribution to the RATP. The city
has equal representation with the state on the Syndicat des Transports
Parisiens (STP), the body responsible for public transport planning in the
capital.
The contrast with London is stark. As the report puts it: 'Overall and
comprehensive planning of transport has been abandoned and the operation of
the transport system has been increasingly dismembered among private
developers, boroughs and counties, different government departments,
nationalised industries and quangos.' The result? In London, the past 25
years has seen the construction of 33km of new Underground/suburban track
and 250km of new motorway; in the same period Paris has brought 137km of new
track and 500km of motorway into service. As to London's long-term plans -
there are none.
There is a neat symmetry to all this. In the 1950s and 1960s Parisian
planners looked to London, its Tubes, red buses and city-wide council, for
inspiration. Now the wheel has come full circle, with Paris the model to be
followed. Perhaps understanding will be facilitated by the opening of the
Channel tunnel link - albeit delayed, and with no fast link to London.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Letter: Reality of pound/franc merger in EMS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From LORD COBBOLD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Picking up Anthony Harris's reference to my suggestion for a
pound/franc merger within the EMS ('When gentlemen prefer bonds', May 26)
the immediate question is whether the pound and franc together would be
better able than individually to break below the Deutsche mark interest rate
barrier.
The weighting of the D-Mark in the Ecu is 30.36 per cent. The weighting of
the pound/franc would be 12.60 + 19.32 = 31.92 per cent. A window of
opportunity has been reopened by the recent strength of the pound - up 2.5
per cent against the franc since the election and only 1.5 per cent away
from the magic figure of 10 francs to the pound.
All that would initially be required is a declaration of intent from the two
governments and a 1.1 per cent adjustment of the pound's central rates
within the EMS parity grid (from 9.8939 to 10 in the case of the franc). It
could be done at the same time as the government moves to the narrow band.
In the medium term the pound/franc would provide an alternative to the
D-Mark/Ecu in the move towards Emu - in line with the Treasury's erstwhile
preference for competing currencies and an evolutionary approach.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Ghosts of the decade past: The Japanese banking system is
under strain from doubtful property loans and a sliding stock market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In Japan we have a saying that if you keep talking about ghosts in a dark
room, the ghosts get bigger and bigger and more fearsome.' That, says Mr
Yoshimasa Nishimura, deputy head of the banking bureau of Japan's Ministry
of Finance, is just the way foreigners are scaring themselves about the
health of the Japanese banks.
His former colleague Mr Toyoo Gyohten, now at the Bank of Tokyo, is even
more emphatic: 'There is absolutely no concern about a systemic problem of
the banking industry here,' he says.
Not everyone shares his view. Japanese bank shares have lost nearly 40 per
cent of their value since the beginning of the year, in anticipation of the
falling profits and rising bad-debt provisions which the top 11 commercial
banks reported yesterday. Western bankers have been asking their Tokyo
offices for urgent reassessments of the credit status of the Japanese banks
with which they do business. Do they know something about ghosts that the
ministry does not?
For part of the answer, talk to Mr Tatsunari Ushimaru of Teikoku Databank, a
Japanese credit-data service. As Japan's economy has slowed over the past
year, bankruptcies have risen, he says, but the debts of the average
bankrupt company have risen far faster, threefold in three years.
Mr Ushimaru calls these 'bubble bankruptcies', after the surge in asset
values that drove Tokyo land and share prices to unsustainable heights in
the late 1980s. Shares have since halved and property values have dropped by
a third - and speculators are paying the price. So are their banks.
The Ministry of Finance says the 21 big Japanese banks have non-performing
loans worth perhaps Y7,000-Y8,000bn, some 2-2 1/4 per cent of total assets
of Y350,000bn. Bankers in Tokyo estimate that loans worth Y56,000bn may
eventually run into problems; some economic analysts put the figures higher
still. Even if loans turn sour, however, most of the money lent may be
recoverable in time. The question for the banks is how much - and how long
it will take.
A Bank of Japan official says the bad debt problem is 'serious but not
lethal'; Mr Makoto Utsumi, special adviser to the finance minister, talks of
'a few years in a very hot tub' for the banks.
The exact temperature of the water is still unclear. Japanese banks
recognise loans as non-performing only when no interest has been paid for
six months. The close ties between lender and borrower often lead the banks
to cut interest rates for a troubled debtor - a concession that keeps the
loan out of the non-performing category. Bad-debt provisions are thus
traditionally low: yesterday, the 11 big commercial banks announced a
fivefold rise in provisions, but the combined figure was still only Y344bn.
One feature of the bubble years adds to the lack of clarity. The banks lent
Y80,000bn to non-bank finance companies, which then lent much of the money
on to property developers. 'When non-banks borrowed from a bank they would
not have to put up collateral,' says Mr Tokio Inoue, senior managing
director of Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank, 'but the bank would want to see that they
had adequate collateral for their own lending. Major banks typically lend up
to 70 per cent of the value of collateral, but in recent years non-banks
made loans of 100 per cent of the value of real estate.'
This means, he says, that the proportion of money recoverable is lower than
before, 'but time will solve the problem'. His confidence is shared. Mr
Kazuhiko Kasai, senior managing director of Fuji Bank, says: 'Even at the
current market price our troubled loans are fully covered by collateral.'
Up to a point. There is no real secondary market for buildings in Japan, so
the market price is an estimate rather than one derived from actual
transactions; it may not be very accurate at the moment.
Still, as Japanese bankers point out, there are very few 'transparent'
(unlet) buildings in Tokyo. 'We don't have as serious a situation in the
real estate market as in the City of London, New York, or Melbourne,' says
Mr Yoh Kurosawa, president of the Industrial Bank of Japan. 'The problem
will be over in one to two years.'
Bad loans are only one of the banks' problems, however. Just as important is
the way the sliding stock market affects the capital adequacy standards of
the Bank for International Settlements, which are due to take effect next
year. These standards require international banks to have capital equivalent
to 8 per cent of assets. Half that capital must be 'tier 1', shareholders'
equity; the other half is 'tier 2', such as subordinated debt.
Ten years ago, when the capital standard was first proposed, Japanese banks
had tier 1 ratios of about 2 1/2 per cent. They had one advantage, however:
they could count 45 per cent of unrealised gains on their equity portfolios
as tier 2 capital. As stocks soared in the late 1980s, the banks' share
portfolios soared in value, boosting tier 2 capital; and they were able to
issue large amounts of equity, boosting tier 1.
Now that process has gone into reverse, as the stock market has fallen.
Unrealised gains for the 21 big banks have dropped by two-thirds, to
Y17,000bn in March 1992; and the window for raising equity has slammed shut.
Achieving BIS standards next March depends critically on the stock market.
With the Nikkei below 17,000 - as it was in April - many big Japanese banks
would not meet the new standard. Above 18,000, the level seen for much of
May, most of them do. Yesterday, the Nikkei closed at 17,931.25.
What if the stock market falls again? One fear, heard in Europe or the US
rather than in Tokyo, is of a downward spiral: to shore up capital, banks
liquidate part of their equity portfolios, but that pushes the market down
further, forcing the banks into more share sales, leading to a further
market decline, and so on down to disaster.
The big banks did sell some of their share portfolios in March, says the
Bank of Japan. But a full-scale liquidation is unlikely. Those equity
shareholdings represent important links in the web of cross-holdings
characterising Japanese industry.
'We have 1 per cent of Japan Inc in our portfolio, says Mr Reese Harasawa of
Mitsubishi Bank. 'I don't think we'll be changing that.' Sales of the banks'
core equity holdings would totally change banking relationships, he says.
The bank has tried to find shares to sell, such as those of unprofitable
customers. 'To our regret, the number of shares we could identify in this
category was very small.'
Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank's Mr Inoue cites other possible changes. For example,
when a Japanese bank makes a loan, the borrower must usually re-deposit a
chunk of the money with the bank. Such 'compensating balances' make up 10-20
per cent of the big banks' total deposits, he says. Eliminating these and
the corresponding borrowing would lower the banks' assets and stretch
capital further. 'I hope we do not have to do this,' says Mr Inoue, 'because
it might jeopardise customer relationships. But it may be a final resort.'
By such means, the banks are likely to squeak by the BIS ratios next March
even if the stock market weakens again. More generally, the Ministry of
Finance has guided the Japanese banking system so skilfully over the years
that it must be given the benefit of the doubt. No Japanese bank, large or
small, has failed since the 1930s.
None the less, the Japanese financial system is undergoing profound changes.
Some, under way in the mid-1980s but muffled by the bubble years, are
reasserting themselves.
One is a tug of war over the banks' profitability. As Japanese interest
rates are deregulated, the banks' cost of funds is rising; at the same time,
they will have to write off some of their 1980s lending. Both these will
reduce profitability. There are also forces pulling in the other direction,
however. Because the rates at which banks lend have been deregulated before
those they pay to retail depositors, they have been able to widen margins
sharply as the overall level of interest rates has fallen in the past year.
In the short run, underlying profitability is rising - yesterday the 11
biggest banks reported that 'net business profits', a measure of lending
profitability, rose 32 per cent last year. In the long run, the banks, like
other Japanese industries, are likely to place greater emphasis on profit,
less on volume.
This change stems in part from the second trend at work: a sharply higher
cost of capital for all Japanese businesses, not just the banks. In the
1980s, as soaring share prices allowed companies to issue large amounts of
stock, Japanese firms' cost of equity was about 4 percentage points points
lower than in the US, says a study by J P Morgan; now it is 1 percentage
point higher.
At the same time, banks must cope with the difficulties of slower growth. In
the late 1980s, Japanese bank assets grew at more than 12 per cent a year in
real terms. No other group of banks achieved even half that growth rate;
British banks grew at at 2 1/2 per cent, US banks at less than 2 per cent.
Last year Japanese banks' lending grew by only a nominal 2.9 per cent; at
Sakura Bank, loans actually fell.
The strains in the Japanese banking system have big implications for the
rest of the world. Japanese banks have been cutting back sharply on
low-yielding assets, especially overseas interbank lending. This has not
represented a net drain of capital to the world, however, because Japanese
banks have run down their overseas liabilities even faster than their
foreign assets.
As the Japanese pull back, there has been a marked impact on competition in
international banking markets, where margins are widening across the board.
This may be a lasting trend. Japanese banks clearly believe they were too
ambitious in their international activities in the late 1980s. Mr Nishimura,
of the finance ministry, says: 'Judging from results, probably the
international activities of Japanese banks were above the capabilities they
had at that time.' And Mr Ken-ichi Suematsu, president of Sakura Bank, one
of Japan's biggest, goes further: 'Most if not all of Japanese banks'
international activities, I feel, were a failure.'
'Japanese banks lacked due caution in doing business. They tried to get
involved in lending to big international projects without paying due
attention to profitability and local practices.' In ways like these,
Japanese bank managers will have to live with the ghosts of the 1980s for
years to come.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Freedom's radio days are not yet over

<TEXT>
We will never know whether the entire explanation for the collapse of
communism lies in its own internal grotesqueries, or whether some
assistance, or at least a gentle nudge, was given by broadcasts from the
west. Was it the food and consumer goods shortages alone, or were the words
transmitted across the iron curtain by the BBC World Service, the Voice of
America, Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty really effective? There can be
no precise answer, but most people believe that the wireless facilitated the
liberation of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. Britain's Mr David
Howell, once energy and then transport secretary under Mrs Thatcher and
latterly chairman of the parliamentary select committee on foreign affairs,
argued some years ago that the spread of world communications would do
irreparable damage to totalitarian regimes.
In this he predated Mr Francis Fukuyama, whose celebrated book, The End of
History and the Last Man, suggests that the ideological struggle has come to
an end - that, as the author would put it, liberal democracy remains the
only coherent political aspiration that spans different regions and cultures
across the globe. On a bad day, if you have your guard down, it is not
difficult to persuade yourself to fall for this hokum. One speaker at the
recent conference of the International Press Institute described how
Japanese technicians are working on 'down-sizing' satellite TV receiver
dishes. They are currently around 600mm wide, so you must nail them to an
outside wall. The Japanese aim is a diameter of 50mm by the end of the
century. Then tiny clandestine TVs could enhance the further spread of
western ideas; eventually everyone would live in a pluralist democracy and
shop at a Safeway. It is a comfortable materialistic fantasy, but the truth
is that proponents of liberal democracy can never rest. The battle is not
over.
I was reminded of this in Budapest last week. The Hungarian prime minister,
Dr Jozsef Antall, had attempted to sack the heads of the state radio and
television administrations. The state president, an unassuming intellectual
called Arpad Goncz, refused to sign the dismissal documents. Mr John Major
met both of them yesterday; the hope must be that if the subject came up he
reinforced the view of the president that democracy would be jeopardised by
the dismissals. What Hungary needed, we were told by Mr Goncz when I was
there, was 'BBC standards'.
Anecdotes of this kind are capped dozens of times over in two volumes
published by Broadside Books, London, yesterday to mark the 60th anniversary
of the BBC World Service. The first, A World in Your Ear, by John Tusa,
managing director of the World Service, is a happy collection of letters,
essays and diary extracts; the second, A Skyful of Freedom, by Andrew
Walker, is an illustrated popular history. Both are inevitably flavoured
with corporate self-congratulation, but this is excusable. The World Service
has much to congratulate itself about.
As one example, Mr Tusa reprints a letter from Romanian Moldavia, received
in February 1990: 'I have persistently listened to your broadcasts, many
times hidden under a blanket in my monastic cell . . . I am convinced you
made an important contribution to what we Romanians are experiencing today.'
Another, recalled by Mr Walker, is the tale of how news from Mr Boris
Yeltsin's revolutionary 'white house' during the attempted coup of 1991 was
relayed through the BBC Moscow office. Listening in during his confinement
was Mr Mikhail Gorbachev. The BBC's reports, he said afterwards, had been
the most reliable; to his way of thinking they had confirmed that the whole
action was doomed to failure.
The BBC's reputation for objectivity has been hard-earned. Its power derives
from its refusal to propagandise. There is no need to be carried away by
this. I broadcast regularly on the overseas service during the 1960s and,
while I was never censored or instructed, the producers were often ready
with a 'could you perhaps put that another way?' - always, of course, in the
interest of balance. Bush House, headquarters of the service, is not
inhabited by saints or political eunuchs.
The more hard-edged American services lack the BBC's brand name, but they
have been powerful in their own way. The Voice of America is forever
condemned to be regarded as a weapon of the Cold War. It was founded in
1942, as a counter to Nazi propaganda; it turned to its anti-red crusade
later, as an arm of the US Information Agency. Radio Free Europe and Radio
Liberty began as CIA operations, but for many years they have tried to win
reputations for presenting the truth. Their journalists are certainly less
politically tainted than some of those who work on Britain's popular papers.
Like the BBC, Radio Liberty had its own correspondents inside Mr Yeltsin's
white house; its broadcasts in 12 Soviet languages were used by Mr Yeltsin
as a means of circumventing the official media during the coup. Such
investments have paid dividends. Most ex-communist countries now permit the
BBC and the American voices to relay news directly to their domestic
listeners. Their news-gatherers operate locally.
You might think that since the Cold War is over there is no reason for
British and American taxpayers to continue to finance such outfits. Not so.
For what we get the money is peanuts, but that is beside the point. There
are two important jobs yet to do. The first is to protect the governments of
the newly liberated countries from succumbing to the temptation to bully
their broadcasters, just as the communists did. The spread of 'BBC
standards' across eastern Europe and the countries of the former Soviet
Union has yet to be achieved. It is hard to emerge from 40 years of darkness
with an understanding that democracy means learning to live with the
accusations of your political opponents.
The second job for the freedom broadcasters is to work in those vast areas
of the globe that have not yet behaved according to the suppositions of Mr
Fukuyama. The people of the Middle East, much of Africa and all of China are
in need of objective information about what is happening inside their
countries. A US federal commission has been considering the establishment of
a 'Radio Free Asia'; it is said that President Bush is opposed, on the
ground that it would upset the government of China. This is perverse. The
purpose of factual broadcasts in Chinese, by Chinese speakers, should be to
upset the government of China. I hope the BBC maintains its traditions in
its daily 45 minutes of Cantonese and 3 1/2 hours of Mandarin, broadcast
from Hong Kong. Someone has to give the Beijing regime a nudge.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Swiss movement
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER YEARS of dithering, the Swiss have reached a moment of decision. Last
week's referendum, in which they decided to join the IMF and the World Bank,
confirms earlier hints of withdrawal from dogmatic neutrality. The
government's move to apply for membership of the EC, together with the
scheduling of two referendums later this year on joining the European
Economic Area, has clearly posed the European question.
From the EC's viewpoint, Swiss membership in both bodies is welcome.
Exporters of goods and services to Switzerland would benefit from the
removal of mechanisms which still protect 70 per cent of Swiss internal
trade from market forces. Politically, Britain in particular would find
Switzerland a valuable ally, sharing its concern about the EC's bureaucratic
and centralising tendencies. And the Community as a whole would benefit from
Swiss administrative and diplomatic competence.
From the Swiss viewpoint, closer links with the EC would improve the
economic outlook at a time when the special circumstances which led to
Switzerland's postwar industrial and financial success have disappeared.
Contrary to some perceptions, the Swiss have never been isolationist. But
they risk being isolated in the future unless they move closer to the EC.
The young are suffering from being unable to work and study freely in other
European countries. By joining the EEA, the Swiss would assure themselves a
place inside the world's largest trading bloc.
There are heavy costs, notably a commitment to invest a colossal SFr30bn or
so over the next 20 years to build two new rail tunnels through the Alps.
Yet the Swiss have much more to gain than to lose from EEA membership.
The question of joining the EC is more difficult. The Swiss confederation is
a relatively weak alliance of four linguistic groups, which do not obviously
have much more in common than a currency, a railway and a postal service. It
has been held together by a light and decentralised structure of government,
and by the tradition of referring most decisions to the people. If it joined
the EC, regional and linguistic alliances could become stronger than the
national one, and the frail glue that holds the confederation together could
weaken further.
Perhaps that would not matter, if the Swiss succeeded in communicating the
secret of their improbable cohesion to a wider Europe, of which they are
already the geographical heart and linguistic microcosm.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Damp strike
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S DAMP squib of a general strike in Spain marked a victory for the
efforts of Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, to steer his country down
the road of EC convergence. However, the toughest part of Spain's bid to
prepare for economic and monetary union is still to come. The drive to bring
Spain's economy more into line with the performance of its European partners
represents a threefold challenge. It will test Mr Gonzalez's ability to
govern up to and beyond the next general election, due to take place no
later than October 1993. It will test Spain's ability to compete
successfully with the rest of the industrialised world. And it will test the
Community's ability to sustain a political consensus in favour of the strict
Emu disciplines imposed under the Maastricht treaty.
On the first point, Mr Gonzalez's achievement in standing up to union
opposition must improve his chances of going to the polls as Spain's
unscathed Don Convergencia.
The latter two tasks will be more difficult. The challenges have been
increased by slower growth in western Europe, now weathering a period of
economic doldrums comparable only with the 1981-82 recession. Spain, in
common with other EC countries, has tailored its medium-term economic
strategy to the goal of meeting - if not bettering - the Maastricht economic
convergence objectives.
Yet the strictness of the targets seems likely to limit the opportunities
for a resumption of higher EC growth by the mid-1990s. Without this faster
expansion, Community members will face great problems in generating the
extra fiscal revenues needed to satisfy the Emu requirement of bringing
their budgets into better balance. The EC must be alive to the risk that the
Maastricht route could turn into a vicious circle.
Spain's general government budget deficit is still stuck at more than 4 per
cent of gross domestic product, against the Maastricht target of 3 per cent.
Lowering this fiscal imbalance by cutting public subsidies and reducing
unemployment benefits forms the centrepiece of Mr Gonzalez's convergence
plan. Spain arguably has a better chance of meeting the Maastricht targets
than Italy, warned by the EC last week in the stiffest terms to bring its
budget policies on track for Emu.
To soften the impact of planned fiscal austerity, Madrid is placing great
store on the Maastricht pledge for the northern states to provide southern
EC members with 'cohesion' funds to ease the strictures of Emu. Germany,
whose generosity as the EC's principal paymaster has been necessarily
reduced by reunification, is however making clear that cutting its own
budget deficit must take priority over channelling largesse southwards. Mr
Gonzalez may have parried yesterday's thrust from the union leaders. He
still has to grapple with Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Arts: Berlin Festival Fringe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JACKIE WULLSCHLAGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With a wheelbarrow, a crutch and a bicycle, a new work by an obscure young
director leaps on to a stage made of wooden crates and in 75 minutes knocks
out its sedate festival audience. The unexpected hit of the Berlin Festival,
The End of the Workhouse seems to announce in Andrej Woron and his Teatr
Kreatur an exciting force in European theatre.
The play is a fragment of an Isaac Babel story about a group of Jews in
post-revolutionary Odessa who eke out a living burying the dead in shrouds,
with a single reusable coffin. When a revolutionary hero dies, the Russian
boss orders him to be laid to rest in the coffin itself. Their livelihood
gone, the Jews are expelled from the workhouse and starve.
But for Woron the story is a starting point for theatre as a return to myth.
With barely a dozen phrases spoken - 'To the cemetery]', 'In Odessa]' - he
sketches it as a montage in which the rituals of mime, dance, and music
crystallise an image of eastern European Jewish life in 1917 and make it a
symbol for timeless themes: survival versus mass destruction, the brutality
of changing one kind of world for another, the powerless individual against
the state.
It is history dramatised as a sort of beggar's opera for our times. To
waltzes and folksongs and jazz, marches and drumbeats, strident, yearning
and joyful, Woron's troupe of puppet players live out ceremonies,
revolutions, circuses, and funerals.
With faces exaggerated into grotesque masks, some bony and chalk-white,
others smudged black, eyebrows and sockets mockingly enlarged, lips curved
into jaunty triangles or open circles, they recall the expressionist visages
of Dix or Beckmann.
A soldier on stilts acts as a tin model, bandy-legged, his paint worn off. A
drunkard boozes from an hourglass, the bottle filling up rather than
emptying as it reaches his mouth; he acquires four faces and spirals round
under a carousel, challenging us to tell flesh from make-up.
Out of a ghostly stillness all explode into action at one stroke,
clattering, stampeding, shrieking in flight; whispering hoarsely, flopping
into a heap. They are automatons in voice and movement, their rhythm and
tempo now speeded up to a frenzy, now wound down to slow motion. But the
fearful, eager look in their eyes, directed always at us as they hardly
react to each other, is almost unbearably moving, the more so as it is set
off by Woron's cast of broken mechanical toys - an armless harlequin on a
bicycle, a two-headed doll somersaulting in a pram - which his real actors
do, yet do not, resemble.
In the final scene, the end of the workhouse, the curtains fall from the
stage and it breaks into dozens of little boxes which each actor chases
furiously before opening the lids and pulling out an effigy of himself as a
corpse: 'the dead live longer than the living'. Not since the 'happenings'
of Woron's fellow Pole, the great director Tadeusz Kantor who died in 1990,
have I experienced theatre at once so raw and emotional and yet so precisely
disciplined, in execution and conception, into an artistically coherent
whole.
It is the play Berlin has been waiting for; it now deserves an international
tour.

There is a growing trend towards getting the public to provide its own
entertainment on television. After those ghastly video clip programmes, full
of embarrassing incidents at weddings, and accident prone toddlers, BBC1 is
offering Joker In The Pack (8.30). 'Ordinary people' tell their favourite
jokes and then, in many cases, collapse in hysterical appreciation of their
own wit. Samples: What's orange and sounds like a parrot? A carrot. A ship
carrying red paint collided with a ship carrying blue paint; both crews were
marooned. You have been warned. However, Rory Bremner (9.00 BBC2) is the
real thing. Some impressionists are either limited in the people they can
'do' or mean with their material. Bremner is profligate. Last week in rapid
succession he did John Major, Barry Norman, Bruce Forsyth, Ted Lowe, John
Smith, Jeremy Paxman, George Bush, Nick Ross, Melvyn Bragg, Donald Sinden,
Douglas Hurd, Peter Snow, Enoch Powell. . .and more. And his jokes are good.
Alien is a space movie about a rocket ship with a hostile life form on
board, directed by Ridley Scott who started off with all those lyrical Hovis
commercials (10.40 ITV).

FT  29 MAY 92 / Arts: Venus Observed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Christopher Fry's play must have seemed pretty odd even in 1950,when first
produced by Laurence Olivier, with Olivier in the key part of Hereward, the
Duke of Altair.
On one level it is remarkably erudite: there are literary and classical
allusions all over the place, as well as some science as the Duke surveys
the stars and the planets from his observatory. At another level there are
some very funny lines and marvellous opportunities for stage effects like
the eclipse of the sun and the Duke's country house catching fire. There is
a good plot to go with it.
Yet even in an age when verse drama was more fashionable than it is today,
audiences may have been deterred by the occasional ramblings off into poetic
monologues. The piece does not quite fit together.
And so it is at Chichester, where Donald Sinden has stepped comfortably into
the role once played by Olivier. The Duke is an ageing seducer who brings
back his lady friends to watch the eclipse with the intention of settling
down with one of them for good. The trouble is that his son, Edgar, is cast
in his father's mould. Both father and son fall for the unexpected guest
Perpetua, who is the daughter of the embezzling estate manager, Reedbeck.
Sinden is a most accomplished seducer and an actor who delights in esoteric
lines as much as the bawdy. On the first night he looked a bit nervous, as
if wondering how such an extraordinary play would go down at the Chichester
Festival. He need not have worried unduly. He was applauded on his first
entry and Venus Observed has enough good things in it to make it succeed.
Chichester is an excellent place for it. The semi-circular stage reaches out
into the audience and, with lighting all round, is just the setting for an
eclipse. Curiously this is the one area where James Roose-Evans' production
does not rise to the challenge. The eclipse is partial; the lights never
quite go out. It would be much better if the audience and the cast could be
given a frisson by temporary total darkness. On the other hand, the fire in
the second act suggests the entire stage may be in danger of burning down.
There is a curiosity about the verse. Sometimes it is only barely
detectable. It comes out most strongly in some of the lines spoken by
Perpetua, played by Heather Stannard. Some of Sinden's speeches are also
strikingly poetic. I find these changes of gear rather pleasing; others may
think them confusing and even archaic.
Literary flourishes abound. The Duke tells Perpetua that she must try to use
longer sentences. She then speaks what must be the longest sentence in the
history of the English theatre, although there is a slightly questionable
use of a colon in the middle. The audience is applauding her home as if
egging on an athlete towards the end of a middle-distance race.
The primary influence on the play appears to be Shaw, perhaps because we
have recently seen Heartbreak House revived at the Haymarket. There is a lot
of Captain Shotover in the Duke of Altair. Fry also has Shaw's fascination
with language and his ability to make sudden jokes like the lines about how
to spell 'epidemic' and how many children had the Roi du Soleil.
Again, as in Shaw, some of the characters are more developed than others.
Apart from Sinden, outstanding here are Denis Quilley as the estate manager
and Valerie Taylor as Rosabel, the old flame whom the Duke decides to settle
for, once she has done her spell in prison for arson.

Barnacles on ships' hulls lead to increased friction and higher fuel
consumption, slowing down the vessel and speeding up metal corrosion. On
offshore platforms the deposits can cause a destabilising load on the
structural members.
At present there is no ideal recipe against fouling. But researchers at TNO,
the Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research, believe that
sea sponges may hold the secret to an environmentally friendly anti-fouling
technology.
Field and lab tests using 50 different species of sponge from the Caribbean
Sea have revealed the sponge's ability to shun barnacles, bi-valves and
algae. But the active substances providing the protection are not yet
understood.

Electricians have long known that current in electrical systems can be
monitored by measuring the magnetic field around conductors in the circuit.
But there is no method of monitoring current in twin or multiple cables
without disturbing the protective sheath, writes Andrew Baxter.
Now Mike Watson, a British inventor, has developed a cable coupling
transformer which provides the long sought-after non-contact method of
monitoring current in twin-cored cables. The Watsonline system can send or
receive electrical information without picking up interference, allowing a
high level of amplification.
Watson, who is managing director of Paraphone, the group set up to exploit
the product commercially, sees a range of applications for the device apart
from providing a simple way for electricians to check currents or do fault
diagnosis.
Connected to a loudspeaker, it could replace inductive loops for people with
hearing difficulties. Alternatively, it could be used as an instant pocket
telephone loudspeaker or for underwater voice communication.

Until last year Carlin Music, one of Britain's oldest music publishers, kept
85,000 contracts in filing cabinets.
Contracts were pulled out whenever they were needed and as a result many
became dog-eared. Occasionally a copy might even go missing. The catalogue
continued to grow and Carlin finally realised that it needed a more
efficient method of storage. 'Adding more staff and filing cabinets would
have only made the problem bigger,' says Amos Biegun, computer manager at
Carlin.
The obvious alternative was an electronic imaging system, but until recently
they have been prohibitively expensive. Now, however, falling hardware
prices and software packages which will run on industry standard PCs have
brought such systems within the reach of small businesses like Carlin.
Beginning in December Carlin began the process of replacing its manual
filing system with a document imaging system based on a PC-based document
image processing (Dip) software package called ScanView Professional from
Greengage Development, a leading UK-based Dip developer.
Using a high-speed, 20-page-per-minute document scanner Carlin's contracts
were scanned into the system and squeezed using file compression techniques.
They were then stored electronically. Because Carlin needed to store so many
documents, an optical 'juke box' was also installed which makes several
discs - each of which holds up to 30,000 pages - available instantly.
The system including hardware cost about Pounds 30,000 and is expected to
pay for itself quickly. Carlin is now considering using Greengage's latest
product, FilePlus V2.0, for its other document storage and retrieval needs
including copyright, royalties and accounting.
Greengage will be one of the exhibitors at the two-day OIS/Document
Management 92 conference and exhibition at Wembley Conference and Exhibition
Centre in London, which begins on Tuesday. The event has been arranged by
Meckler, the IT conference and exhibition organiser, and Cimtech (the
National Centre for Information Management and Technology).

FT  29 MAY 92 / Technology: Feel the force - Apple will today unveil Newton,

Is your desk a mess? Do you have a hard time keeping track of notes from
meetings and phone calls? Have you ever missed an appointment because you
forgot to write it in your diary after a business trip?
What you need, according to Apple Computer, is 'Newton', a pocket-sized
electronic gadget that will help you to 'take control of your life and get
organised'.
John Sculley, Apple chairman and chief executive, will provide the first
public demonstration of prototype Newton technology at the Consumer
Electronics Show in Chicago today. 'This is the beginning of the biggest
thing Apple has ever done. Our goal is to be the Johnny Appleseed of this
new market for highly personalised devices that you can carry around in your
pocket.' Apple plans to start selling the devices early next year.
The prototype is just the beginning, Apple executives stress. Even so, it
has an obvious appeal. A little black box, about seven inches by
four-and-a-half inches, at first glance Newton looks like a Sony Diskman,
with curved surfaces and rounded edges; a 'soft friendly shape' that invites
you to hold it, as Apple's marketers put it.
A flip-up lid reveals a five-by-three-inch grey screen with black 'icons'
printed on it. There are no buttons to press, except the on/off switch. A
pen-like stylus slots into the side of the unit.
You use Newton like a note pad, jotting down lists of things to do,
sketching diagrams, recording appointments as you talk on the phone or
taking notes in a meeting.
Automatically, the machine will file the information, putting appointments
in the electronic calendar, recording phone numbers and addresses, or
storing away notes that can be retrieved easily.
Newton's biggest advantage over paper and pen, even for the most
well-organised of people, is its ability to communicate via facsimile,
telephone or computer networks. You could, for example, scribble a 'Happy
Birthday' note to be sent tomorrow. Newton will make sure you don't forget,
and send the message automatically.
Or perhaps you are going to Paris. A phone call will supply Newton with such
information as a map of the Paris Metro, along with a built-in phrase book
and perhaps a guide to the Louvre. Point to a spot on the map and it will
tell you how to get there. Write what you need to say and it will translate.
The extent to which Newton can call upon outside help, such as the Paris
guide, will depend upon the development of third-party software and
information services.
Establishing new distribution channels for Newton is also an important step
in Apple's strategy to play a leading role in what Sculley predicts will
become Dollars 3.5 trillion (million million) market by the turn of the
century for a new class of consumer products that blend computer and
communications technologies with entertainment and information services.
Apple aims to sell Newton to people who have little interest in technology,
and even those who are averse to high-tech gadgets, so the company's
promotions will not stress technical details.
However, some sophisticated computer hardware and software will be hidden
inside Newton's little black box. The unit will be powered by a Risc
processor designed by Advanced Risc Machines of Cambridge, England, which
engineers say was chosen for its high performance and low power consumption.
To provide strong data storage capacity, Apple will make use of 'flash
memory cards' that can store up to 20 MBytes of data on a card not much
bigger than a credit card.
Early models of Newton will incorporate infra-red communications to exchange
data with computers over short distances. Ultimately, however, Apple aims to
give Newton the ability to operate across longer distances by using radio
communications.
Yet Apple's strength, in what is expected to become a highly competitive
market, lies in its software. The handwriting recognition programs
demonstrated by Apple are winning acclaim among industry experts. Unique to
Newton is its ability to recognise and to make symmetrical rough sketches of
shapes. A user, for example, may scrawl a circle and it will automatically
be rounded and centred. Future Newton products will also incorporate speech
recognition.
Perhaps Apple's greatest advantage as it approaches this emerging market is
imagination. Numerous companies have introduced 'pen computers', but none
has so far aimed them at the mass consumer market. Others, such as
Hewlett-Packard, Poqet Computer and Psion offer pocket-sized computers, but
none is as simple to use as Newton. There are also plenty of 'electronic
organisers' on the market, but these appeal only to high-tech gadget fans.
None the less, Apple faces some significant challenges. The company's
reluctance to detail features of its first Newton appears to reflect the
difficulty it faces in compromising between performance and price. The data
storage capacity of the first Newton model may, for example, determine
whether it will sell for about Dollars 500 or for more than Dollars 700.
Breaking with its past practice of jealously guarding proprietary
technology, Apple is looking for technology partners who will license its
Newton technology to create compatible products that may also compete with
Apple's Newton. Royalties from licensees will make up a significant portion
of Apple's Newton revenues within a few years, the company predicts.
The first such Apple Newton partner is Sharp Electronics of Japan, which
will manufacture Newton products for Apple as well as making its own
versions for the Japanese market.
Apple is also expected to face stiff competition. Casting a shadow over
today's demonstration at the Consumer Electronics Show in Chicago was the
announcement yesterday that Tandy, a force in the US consumer electronics
market, is to collaborate with Casio, one of Japan's leading consumer
electronics manufacturers, to develop, manufacture and market a line of
personal information devices based on 'open standards' that will compete
directly with Apple's Newton.

<TEXT>
Only in California would you find a family therapist turned management
consultant running his business on a sail boat and a golf course, and making
a good profit during recession.
J 'Mitch' Perry, president of the Perry Corporation based in Palo Alto,
California, is a pioneer of soft consultancy. While British management
consultancies are facing increased competition and lower profits, Perry
expects to increase sales this year by a third.
Soft consultancy uses unorthodox means to get across some of the woolier
aspects of corporate strategy. The idea is that by combining management
theory with some practice on the golf course, the ideas are more likely to
stick.
One of Perry's leading products is the Executive Cup, a lesson in teamwork.
For two days and for Dollars 1,500 (Pounds 850) each, candidates are put in
a classroom and taught how to perform well in a group. They are then cast
off in sailboats on the San Francisco Bay to put the methodology into
practice. 'There is an enormous difference between what people
intellectualise in the classroom and what they actually do in a boat,' says
Perry.
At the end of the course each participant has to declare how they intend to
adapt their behaviour, thus creating what Perry calls 'emotional sign up' to
corporate objectives.
Cynics might say this is simply a tax-efficient way of giving executives a
good time. Yet Perry's clients, having thoroughly enjoyed themselves, swear
it has been of real use to their companies.
Sam Jones, president of the Product Exchange, a fresh produce dealer based
in San Ramon, California, sent 50 of his workforce on the Executive Cup, at
a total cost of Dollars 75,000. He claims that the programme transformed the
whole mentality of his staff, 'It was a wonderful experience,' says Jones,
'It is no longer 'them' and 'us', but 'we', the Produce Exchange.'
Another 'magic and substance' product offered by Perry is the Performance
Classic. This three-day programme costs Dollars 2,500 per person and
includes three mornings on one of California's most prestigious golf
courses. This is not simply way of improving your handicap, says Perry: 'It
is about you and your performance in all aspects of life - personal and
business.'
Jim Dobbins, president of Crestwood Hospitals, a nursing facility based in
northern California, spent more than Dollars 100,000 with the JM Perry
Corporation in 1991, more than he had ever spent before on consultancy and
training. He attended the Performance Classic and says: 'I wanted to improve
my game, but I came away with much more than that. I had a real good feeling
for the principles of reacting rapidly to adversity that Mitch Perry
taught.'
Not all organisations are supportive of this kind of consultancy. 'Some
companies are concerned about their image and say, 'People will think I'm
having too much fun if I go sailing',' admits Perry.
However, a surprisingly large number of US companies seem to view golfing,
sailing, white water rafting and cross country skiing as legitimate ways of
developing business skills. Even during a recession, companies including
Amdahl, Citibank, NEC Technologies and Andersen Consulting have commissioned
services from the JM Perry Corporation. IBM recently joined the ranks,
signing a contract to send 85 employees on the Executive Cup.
It is hard to see the idea working well in Britain: while many businessmen
might relish the idea of three days' golfing on company expenses, their
shareholders might take another view.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Management: No credit to banks - Why the clearers seem
unable to match other companies in terms of service
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAME your 10 favourite large service organisations. If you are anything like
me, they will include several retail chains, a travel agency, a hotel group,
and perhaps an airline, a utility, or a car rental company. My list is
topped by three retailers: Boots and John Lewis in Britain, and LL Bean in
America.
But unless you live in the US, or use Citicorp or American Express abroad,
I'll bet that none of your favourites is a bank or a credit card
organisation. In Britain most retail banks seem to equate good service with
little more than glossy advertising and restyled branch interiors.
This is not just a matter of personal prejudice. My distrust of banks is
shared, for a start, by Linda King Taylor, a service expert who is the
author of a new book with the ambitious title of Quality: Total Customer
Service*. She refused to include any bank in her volume, which consists of
British case studies.
Her reason, she says, was that she could find no UK bank which met her
criteria of excellent customer service. These include: total board
commitment to it; adaptation of all the company's systems to suit the needs
of the customer; thorough training and empowerment of staff to deliver
consistently good service; and continual measurement to ensure this.
She did, however, include cases on a building society (the Portman), on one
part of a utility (the south-eastern region of British Gas), and even -
surprisingly - London's Metropolitan Police.
With the exception of several small branches of two banks, my experience
echoes Taylor's judgment to the letter.
I have just had a telling experience with my new National Westminster Access
credit card. Earlier this month, a polite standard letter arrived, pointing
out that I had exceeded my credit limit, and asking for a payment. No
deadline was given, nor any warning to avoid using the card until payment
had been received. Yet a few days later I heard from a puzzled shop that a
tiny charge - for Pounds 10.50 - had been refused.
Not even the once-vilified North Thames area of British Gas, in its blackest
days of service quality (now very much rectified), would have done such a
thing. Cutting off a customer's supply without warning, whether the
commodity be gas or credit, is to break one of the most fundamental
principles of any type of service: the need to keep the customer informed.
To be fair to NatWest, both its Access department and its HQ staff handled
the matter helpfully. They also admitted that the velvet-phrased letter and
the iron-fisted action were inconsistent, or 'faintly strange', as one
employee put it. The mismatch between the offending systems is now being
reviewed.
This responsiveness in dealing with at least one customer's complaint
dilutes (very slightly) one's obvious surprise at finding NatWest listed as
one of '50 European companies with top quality service' in a new book which
is directly competitive with Taylor's.
The volume, under the main title of Total Customer Satisfaction**, is
co-authored by two consultants, Jacques Horowitz and Michele Jurgens Panak.
The latter has particular expertise in banking.
But this does not make her any kinder to that industry than Taylor. She
cites three main reasons why retail banks, especially in Britain, generally
fail to offer as high service quality as many other types of organisation.
First, she says they have to deal with relatively large numbers of people,
both internally and externally. (She cites NatWest's 110,000 employees and
6m customers.) That makes for plenty of fallible human contacts between
employees and customers. Yet some retail chains have nearly as many people
to deal with, both internally and externally, and yet provide an excellent
standard of service.
Second, Jurgens points to the banks' high rate of staff turnover, which
makes quality service difficult to achieve and sustain. Yet turnover is
equally high among some retail chains - especially those laggards which do
relatively little to retain staff.
Jurgens hits the nail on the head with her third reason: that, until
recently, British banks have not experienced much competition. Here they do
differ markedly from the big retailers, who have to battle almost every week
to stop flighty customers deserting to rivals.
So why did Jurgens include NatWest? In some ways she is heavily critical of
the bank, saying that it still suffers from considerable bureaucracy and an
inward-looking culture that puts self-protection before the interests of its
customers. It still has systems that she calls 'so anti-customer that it's
unbelievable'.
All the same, she says there is now a solid group of individuals within the
bank committed to giving good service. She included NatWest because of the
considerable and instructive effort which it has made since introducing its
service quality programme in 1983. This has had patchy results, and has made
little difference to the overall public perception of the bank vis-a-vis its
principal competitors; customer expectations are at last rising. But the
programme constitutes a vital part of the bank's future competitiveness.
For organisations in any type of industry, Jurgens' book, like Taylor's,
contains plenty of helpful advice on how to improve service quality.
Good service companies empower their middle managers, the book argues, by
giving them considerable independence, albeit within varying limits. Banks
need to act likewise: to strike the right balance between empowered people
who can make decisions on their own, and well-designed systems to which
managers and other staff are programmed.
Most banks still err excessively towards over-programming - to systems which
are not even particularly well-designed. They do so at the expense not only
of managerial morale but also of customer service and loyalty.

DENNEY v JOHN HUDSON &amp; CO LTD (FT, May 8)
In the instant case, the creditor made deliveries of diesel oil to the
company both before and after the petition for compulsory winding up. The
liquidator sought a declaration that payments for the deliveries were void
under section 552 of the Companies Act 1985 and section 127 of the
Insolvency Act 1985 which provided that '. . . any disposition of the
company's property . . . made after the commencement of the winding-up,
unless the court otherwise orders, is void'. Dismissing the liquidator's
appeal from a decision that the payments made after presentation of the
petition were valid, the Court of Appeal stated that the parties were acting
in accordance with their normal and established course of business. Under
its standing arrangement, the company received a benefit in that it could
order a supply of fuel oil for which payment was deferred until the next
supply was required. The supplies enabled the business to be carried on and
earn revenue and the court could reasonably assume that what was for the
benefit of the company would be for the benefit of the general body of
creditors. Thus it was not a situation in which one pre-liquidation creditor
was being preferred to the others.
FREEDMAN &amp; OTHERS v BRITISH RAILWAYS BOARD AND ANOTHER; CHURCH COMMISSIONERS
FOR ENGLAND v BRITISH RAILWAYS BOARD AND ANOTHER (FT, May 13)
Some 125 acres of derelict land north of King's Cross Station, which were to
form the terminus of the Channel tunnel rail link and a large commercial
development, had been compulsorily acquired pursuant to the Great Northern
Railway Act 1846. The act empowered the company of that name to build the
railway between London and York and the land had since passed into ownership
of the defendants, British Railways Board and National Carriers Ltd. On a
preliminary issue, it was held that the successors from whom the land had
been compulsorily acquired could buy back some of it at the original
acquisition prices and that acts passed in 1923, 1935 and 1949 had not
repealed the relevant sections of the 1846 act. Allowing the defendants'
appeal, the Court of Appeal stated that section 59 of the British Transport
Commission Act 1949 expressly had repealed those sections. A 'code' of
provisions had been incorporated into the 1846 act and the purpose of
section 59(1) was to cancel the effect of the code and other provisions to
the same effect.
BACHCHAN v INDIA ABROAD PUBLICATIONS INC (FT, May 14)
The plaintiff was successful in a libel action and obtained judgment for
damages in London against a journal, India Abroad, for an edition which had
been printed and distributed in the UK by a subsidiary. He sought to enforce
the judgment in New York where India Abroad had also published the libel.
However, giving judgment for the defendant in New York, the judge stated
that the protection of free speech and the press would be seriously
jeopardised by entry of foreign libel judgments, granted pursuant to
standards deemed appropriate in the UK, but considered antithetical to the
protection afforded to the press by the US Constitution.
LEWIS &amp; PEAT (PRODUCE) LTD AND OTHERS v ALMATU PROPERTIES LTD AND OTHERS
(FT, May 15)
Lewis &amp; Peat obtained judgment against three defendants and sought to
execute that judgment. Its attempts resulted in court orders which included
a garnishee order nisi against Midland, and injunctions restraining Midland
from dealing with the proceeds of sale of two cargoes of cocoa and coffee
beans after collection of the sale proceeds by Midland. Mr Justice Gatehouse
set aside the garnishee proceedings and discharged the injunctions against
Midland, declaring that Midland was free to deal with the proceeds of sale
in accordance with the instructions of its customer, the National
Development Bank of Sierra Leone (NDB); and that NDB was free to give such
instructions as it might see fit, including instructions to transfer the
monies out of the jurisdiction. Lewis &amp; Peat sought to set aside discharge
of the injunctions, and the declaration. Dismissing the appeal, the Court of
Appeal stated that it was of the first importance that routine banking
transactions such as these should not be subject to interference by the
Mareva jurisdiction, except where an exceptionally strong case had been made
out to set aside well-settled principles of banking law.
LAWSON (HM INSPECTOR OF TAXES) v JOHNSON MATTHEY PLC (FT, May 20)
Johnson Matthey owned all the shares in Johnson Matthey Bankers (JMB) which
became unable to pay its debts. It was realised that if JMB could not open
for business, Johnson Matthey itself could not continue to trade. It
therefore agreed to sell the JMB shares to the Bank of England for Pounds 1
and to contribute Pounds 50m to JMB's resources. It now sought to deduct
that sum in the computation of its profits as a revenue and not as a capital
expenditure under section 74 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988.
At first instance and in the Court of Appeal, it was held that the Pounds
50m was paid to get rid of the shares and so was a capital expenditure.
Allowing Johnson Matthey's appeal, the House of Lords stated that, in the
light of the authorities, if the Pounds 50m was paid to procure the transfer
of shares, it was attributable to capital whereas if paid to remove the
threat posed by JMB's insolvency, it was attributable to revenue. The Pounds
50m had been paid solely to enable Johnson Matthey to be able to continue in
business and was not paid to persuade the Bank to take the shares, which
were fully paid up and worthless.
KHERSON (FT, May 21)
The vessel, Kerch, which was owned by a Georgian state company, carried a
cargo of oil to Rotterdam, and the cargo-owners claimed damages for breach
of contract. The cargo-owners sought to arrest Kerch in Rotterdam in October
1990 when security was not forthcoming. In March 1992, a sister ship,
Kherson, was arrested at Felixstowe and the shipowners acknowledged service
of the writ so that the action ceased to be in rem against the ship and now
proceeded in personam against its owners. Article 21 of the 1968 Convention
on Jurisdiction and Enforcement of Judgments provided that where
proceedings, involving the same cause of action between the same parties,
were brought in different contracting states, only the court that was first
seised should have jurisdiction. The cargo-owners contended that Article 21
was inapplicable because it was a different cause of action being in rem and
not in personam, which also entailed different parties. Declining
jurisdiction, Mr Justice Sheen stated the only differences lay in the
remedies available to a successful plaintiff and the procedure to obtain
those remedies. In the instant case, Article 21 applied as the Rotterdam
action and the action before him involved the same cause of action and the
same parties.
HAMED EL CHIATY &amp; CO v THOMAS COOK GROUP LTD (FT, May 22)
Claims were brought against Thomas Cook by the plaintiff, an Egyptian
tourist company, under agreement for charter for a vessel on package tours
on the Nile. The written contract had provided that the agreement would be
governed by Egyptian law but was silent as to jurisdiction. Thomas Cook
contended that the contracts were intended to be subject to the exclusive
jurisdiction of Egyptian courts. Staying the actions in the UK, Mr Justice
Hirst stated that Thomas Cook was entitled to rely on the principle in El
Amria (1981) 2 Lloyd's Rep 119 that the court would generally enforce an
agreement on a rectification order where there was convincing proof that
there had been a prior agreement that was still effective when the
instrument was executed and that by mistake the instrument had failed to
carry it out. Moreover, in applying the test of which country was the
natural forum, the evidence as a whole pointed overwhelmingly in favour of
Egypt since the actions had their most real and substantial connection
there.

Ian Mullen, a 44-year-old merchant banker, has been hired by P&amp;O to
spearhead its expansion in Asia. A Scot who has spent 13 years in Hong Kong,
Mullen has been appointed executive director of the newly-established P&amp;O
Asia which is based in Hong Kong.
Although P&amp;O has long historical ties with Hong Kong - Thomas Sutherland,
one of P&amp;O's more famous chairmen helped found the Hongkong and Shanghai
Bank - it is under-invested in the area. Last year P&amp;O's stock was listed on
the Hong Kong stock exchange and P&amp;O chairman Lord Sterling, who will also
be chairman of the new Hong Kong-based company, has given Mullen the job of
getting P&amp;O more heavily involved in the fast-growing economies of the
region.
Mullen, a former director of Midland Montagu where he was responsible for
the parent bank's Pounds 20bn UK corporate banking portfolio, plans to
expand by a combination of organic growth and non-hostile acquisitions. P&amp;O
Asia will have offices in Singapore, Indonesia, Malaysia and Japan.
Before joining Midland Bank in 1984 as the Hong Kong-based regional head of
corporate finance, Mullen had been a shipping adviser with the Hong Kong
Bank. A graduate of Edinburgh University, he began his career in shipping in
Shetland with Hay and Company and in Italy and the Far East with Mollers
Group.
The other members of the new P&amp;O Asia board are Brian Baillie, executive
deputy chairman, Bruce MacPhail, Sir Frank Lampl, Tim Harris, and Richard
Hein.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf: What now for Docklands? - A body blow to plans
for east London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER and ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF'S failure and increased uncertainty over the Jubilee Line
extension may deal a blow to plans to develop east London.
Private-sector investment and improved transport play a critical part in the
government's ambitious plans to develop the east Thames corridor, an area
stretching from the London Docks through Essex and north Kent.
Although it is the only area capable of substantial growth in the
overcrowded south-east, its development will involve reversing decades of
decline created by its physical isolation, the run-down of its
maritime-based industries and the age-old gravitation of wealth to the west
of the City.
Hillier Parker, a firm of chartered surveyors, believes that extending the
London Underground's Jubilee Line would greatly enhance the development
opportunities of at least 17 sites covering a total of 1,000 acres. The firm
estimates that the value of the land would exceed Pounds 10bn if it were
developed.
Prospects of developing those sites, which have already been set back by the
commercial property decline, might be pushed back indefinitely by delays in
the improvement of transport links. 'Transport links are crucial in terms of
development land,' says Mr Paul Woods, a planner at Hillier Parker.
The largest sites that would benefit from the Jubilee Line extension are
Canary Wharf itself; a 263-acre development on land belonging to British Gas
on the Greenwich Peninsula, for which a mixed retail, commercial and
residential (5,850 homes) scheme is planned; a 180-acre site at Victoria
Dock; and a 240-acre site at Stratford railyard.
There appears to be no immediate threat to the last three of those. British
Gas - which is to contribute about Pounds 25m to the Jubilee Line -
described the threat to the Underground extension as 'a bit of a hiccough',
but it still intends to proceed with its planning application, which
envisages an Underground link at North Greenwich for the development's last
phase in 1997.
More concerned are the local councils immediately affected - Southwark,
Greenwich, Tower Hamlets and Newham - which fear for the prospects of future
development.
The difficulties encountered by Dockland's developers, coupled with the
overall slump in the commercial property industry, is likely to deter future
investors.
Attempts to attract developers to the Royal Docks, the huge expanse of land
to the east of the Isle of Dogs have met little interest.
The London Docklands Development Corporation, the government-funded body set
up to oversee the area's regeneration, remains hopeful that the Jubilee Line
extension will go ahead.
Mr Eric Sorensen, chief executive, emphasised the importance of the line in
creating additional river crossings and opening up Rotherhithe and Deptford.
But even without the extension, the area's road and light railway transport
was improving sharply, he said. 'We hope by the final completion of the road
network plus a reliable railway, we will maintain the momentum of the area.'

FT  29 MAY 92 / Air freight value up sharply
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DANIEL GREEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE VALUE of UK international air freight grew by two thirds between 1980
and 1990 to Pounds 43.7bn a year, the Department of Transport said
yesterday. It accounted for almost a fifth of UK international trade.
Scheduled airlines increased their grip on the market, and three quarters of
international air freight - compared with half in 1980 - was carried on
scheduled passenger services.
London's airports handled 90 per cent of UK international air freight in
1990 - little changed since 1980.
The percentage handled at Heathrow fell from 70 per cent to 62 per cent,
however, while other London airports increased from 19 per cent to 26 per
cent.
In 1990, UK international air trade made up less than 0.5 per cent of total
UK international trade by weight.
UK airlines have lost ground in recent years. Their share of freight lifted
and landed was about 40 per cent in 1990 against 43 per cent in 1980.
Air trade with the US accounted for the highest percentage of total air
trade in 1990. Air trade with the Far East jumped threefold while that with
the rest of the EC rose by only 3 per cent between 1980 and 1990, with
Germany accounting for the biggest EC proportion in 1990.
United Kingdom Airfreight 1980-1990. HMSO. Pounds 13.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Payouts increase in race bias cases
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CATHERINE MILTON, Labour Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS paid a total of Pounds 470,000 in compensation to employees in 120
racial discrimination cases brought to industrial tribunals by the
Commission for Racial Equality last year.  The comparable figure for 1990
was little more than Pounds 150,000.
The increase partly reflects a number of substantial damages awards and
agreed settlements by employers.  The Metropolitan Police, for example, paid
about Pounds 20,000 last year in settlement of one case of alleged racist
abuse.
It also reflects the continuing increase in the number of people bringing
complaints - the commission says the number has risen by about 10 per cent a
year for several years.
Of 1,203 individuals who approached the commission last year, 19 won their
cases at industrial tribunals and 101 accepted settlements outside the
tribunal.
More than 200 people complained of employers refusing to consider them for
employment or offer it to them, and a similar number complained that they
had been refused promotion because of racial discrimination.
About 800 complained of unfair dismissal while fewer than 20 complained of
victimisation after making complaints against employers.
The commission, which has been criticised fro taking up only cases it knows
it can win, decided to give full advice in 342 cases.
By comparison, the Equal Opportunities Commission 'won' 40 of the 58 cases
of discriminationat work that reached a conclusion in 1990.
Seven applicants won their cases in tribunals while 33 settled out of
tribunal.

</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Securities and Exchange Commission has charged Stotler &amp; Co, once a
leading Chicago futures brokerage, and its top four executive officers with
defrauding investors and deceiving the commission about the real state of
the firm's financial condition. The agency is seeking to recover at least
Dollars 15m.
The charge is that Mr Thomas Egan, president and chief operating officer of
Stotler, and three other executives engaged in various schemes to defraud
investors and cover their wrongdoing with 'unlawful, contrived and bogus
transactions.'
The suit alleges, for example, that Dollars 2.2m of the proceeds from
Stotler's initial public offering in 1988 were diverted to certain partners.
Stotler was a futures commission merchant and a commodities pool operator,
as well as a broker-dealer in US government securities.
No criminal penalties are sought but the SEC, beyond seeking that partners
give up gains alleged to have been illicit, requested that Mr Egan never
again be allowed to act as a director or officer of a public company.
The scandal at Stotler, which went broke nearly two years ago, enveloped one
of the futures industry's biggest names, Mr Karsten 'Cash' Mahlmann. He was
chairman of Stotler, and was forced to resign from the chairmanship of the
Chicago Board of Trade, the world's largest futures exchange, two days after
Stotler declared bankruptcy in August 1990.
Mr Mahlmann was not charged with any wrongdoing in the SEC complaint, but
was named as one of 17 partners from whom the agency will seek money that
should have gone - it is alleged - to the investors but was distributed to
partners.

<TEXT>
POLITICAL experts known for their work in the Carter and Reagan presidential
campaigns have been asked to help plan Mr Ross Perot's drive for the US
presidency. .
Among them are Mr Hamilton Jordan, Mr Carter's campaign manager in 1976 and
subsequently White House chief of staff; Mr Ed Rollins, instrumental in Mr
Ronald Reagan's victory in 1984; and Mr John Sears, who ran Mr Reagan's
narrowly unsuccesful bid for the Republican nomination in 1976 and was his
campaign manager again before being replaced early in 1980.
Mr James Squires, Mr Perot's spokesman, confirmed that approaches had been
made but denied that Mr Jordan and Mr Rollins were being offered joint
leadership of the Perot effort. However he said both 'could fit nicely into
this campaign in a number of ways.'
Mr Rollins, now a political consultant whose wife works in the Bush White
House, said yesterday he thought Mr Perot had a good chance of being elected
president, whereas two months earlier he had dismissed such a prospect.
Mr Jordan has been quoted as being an admirer of Mr Perot, though his former
boss, Mr Carter, has come out strongly for Governor Bill Clinton. Mr Jordan,
after a spell running the Association of Tennis Professionals, is now
president of Whittle Communications.
There may be some irony in Mr Perot, the ultimate outsider, considering
recruiting quintessential Washington insiders, but this was probably bound
to happen as the campaign gathered momentum.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Rights to the planet's many species in dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTINA LAMB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF a cure for cancer is found in the bark of a tree grown only in the
northern Amazon, is that tree a Brazilian asset? If so, how should it be
valued? Should countries with the technology to turn it into a
pharmaceutical product be given access to it and if so should they pay
royalties to Brazil? Can a tree be patented?
These are questions being raised in negotiations on biological diversity -
one of the main issues at the Earth Summit and very complex.
Biodiversity refers to all the species of animals, plants, genetic material
and ecosystems in the world. These are essential for the world's food and
fibre needs, and for many medicines, but knowledge of the subject is far
from complete.
To date, 1.4m species have been identified but biologists believe at least
10m - maybe as many as 100m - exist.
Many species are being wiped out at the rate of as many as 75 per day, along
with the acre of tropical forest that vanishes every second because of human
activities such as mining, logging, agriculture and polluting industries.
The belief that species as yet unknown are being lost, and which are
potentially valuable for economic and scientific development, has made
biodiversity an increasingly important issue.
A biodiversity convention was agreed last weekend in Nairobi, at the final
preparatory meeting for the summit, with the aim of maximising and spreading
benefits of biodiversity and improving its conservation.
There is a clear north-south split on this issue, as most of the planet's
biodiversity is to be found in developing countries while the technology to
exploit it lies with the industrialised ones. Countries such as the US want
better access to genetic resources of the third world, while countries such
as Brazil and Malaysia want to ensure a share in its utilisation, thus
running into thorny areas such as intellectual property rights and transfer
of technology and resources.
'To call it a convention on biodiversity is misleading,' says Mr Marcos
Azambuja, Brazil's chief negotiator. 'The real problem is with
biotechnology'. Brazil, and other developing countries, complain that
multinational pharmaceutical groups use substances such as snake venoms and
tree barks found in Brazil without having to pay royalties. The companies
can then sell the drugs on the Brazilian market.
Differences over who should bear the cost of protecting the world's
resources, and how profits for exploitation should be shared, led to an
impasse in the Nairobi negotiations.
The final document was watered down in the view of non-governmental
organisations, and lacked specific commitments on both sides.
While developing countries believe that the issue of biotechnology transfer
has not been clarified as much as they would hope, some countries - such as
US, France and Japan - are threatening not to sign the convention because
they would like tighter commitments on conservation from developing
countries and more protection for their own pharmaceutical companies.
Included in the convention is the need for countries to make inventories of
their ecosystems and for the interim use of the Global Environment Facility,
administered by the World Bank, to fund the programme. In the convention's
current form, the door is left open for the patenting of genetic material by
developing countries.

FT  29 MAY 92 / House passes energy bill with oil-saving aim
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE House of Representatives has passed an energy bill which, according to
its sponsors, could cut US oil imports by nearly one-third by the year 2010.
The bill, voted through easily on Wednesday, has been described as the most
comprehensive piece of energy legislation for more than a decade. It covers
most aspects of domestic energy use and regulation and includes many
compromises between environmental and industry lobbying groups.
The highlights include a prohibition on further offshore oil drilling,
excepting the Gulf of Mexico and Alaska, for the next decade. The
administration had objected to this restriction, but not to the point of
threatening a veto. On the other hand, the oil industry was relieved that it
is not being forced to underwrite a proposal later stripped out of the bill
for a 1bn barrels strategic petroleum reserve.
The bill is not designed to address the concerns likely to be raised at next
week's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
The legislation contains no provision to force the car industry to improve
fuel efficiency standards, but it does encourage greater investment in
vehicles powered by other sources of energy. It also tries to stimulate use
of public transport by placing a limit of Dollars 160 a month on the value
of tax-free car parking privileges offered to employees.
It promotes incentives and tax credits for further development of solar,
wind and geothermal energy supplies and makes slightly easier current
regulations on building nuclear power plants and natural gas pipelines.
Independent non-utility companies would also be encouraged to enter the
power business by requiring existing utilities to make their transmission
facilities available to new entrants.
Congressman Philip Sharp, a Democratic from Indiana, estimated that oil
imports could be cut by 3m barrels a day by 2010, with the equivalent of a
further 2m b/d savings through increased use of other non-fossil sources of
energy. The US now consumes about 17m b/d, roughly half of which is
imported.

<TEXT>
MR Douglas Hurd, Britain's foreign secretary, has concluded a three-day trip
to Mexico promising to make 'a deliberate and vigorous effort' to restore
the UK's 'historical relationship' with Latin America.
His visit - days before the visit of Mr John Major, the British prime
minister, to Brazil and Colombia - is intended to boost trade between the UK
and the region, and prepare the way for President Carlos Salinas's state
visit to the UK in July.
Mr Hurd pressed the Mexican authorities on the North American Free Trade
Agreement, urging that this not erect barriers to the outside world.
'It is rather important that British banks should not be discriminated
against in any serious way,' he said. Mr Hurd understood that Mexican
concessions offered to the US and Canada would be made to other countries
'in the reasonable future'.
The foreign secretary heaped praise on the economic reforms under way in
Latin America, and berated those in the UK who 'are still slow to understand
what is happening.' He described Mexico's reforms 'as a leading example of
what can be done by following sensible policies.'
Mr Hurd was less flattering about Mexico's path to democracy. 'President
Salinas is modernising Mexican democratic arrangements. I support this
process: I hope it will go further,' he said.
The foreign secretary visited Guadalajara, scene of the gas explosion that
killed more than 200 people last month, and announced a Pounds 100,000
contribution to the disaster relief fund.
AP reports from Washington: Mexico City is to have a Dollars 100m loan to
help tackle its pollution problem, the Inter-American Development Bank
announced.

FT  29 MAY 92 / An embarrassment of riches for President Suharto: The
opposition, set to lose the coming election, is making accusations of
nepotism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM KEELING
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA'S President Suharto will have been watching the parliamentary
election campaign, now in its third week, with more than usual interest.
Leaders of opposition parties have highlighted an issue likely to embarrass
the President: alleged nepotism within government, in particular that the
business interests of Mr Suharto's children have enjoyed political favours.
The president's ruling Golkar party is still expected to win the June 9
election with a large majority, supported by a 20-year record of economic
growth averaging more than 6 per cent a year. Nevertheless, the public
airing of such divisive issues is a significant change in a country which
prides itself on consensus.
There have been growing allegations - attributed by government supporters to
jealousy - that companies controlled by members of the Suharto family have
received favours in the form of monopoly rights.
The most controversial has been a monopoly in the buying and selling of
cloves granted in January 1990 to BPPC, an unquoted company headed by Mr
Hutomo Mandala Putra, Mr Suharto's youngest son.
Cloves are the key ingredient in Indonesia's kretek cigarettes and,
diplomats say, BPPC shareholders include many traders who had built up
stocks in the mid-1980s. BPPC doubled the price paid to farmers and told
cigarette companies to pay almost twice as much again, giving BPPC a
projected turnover of more than Rp1,000bn (Dollars 500m) last year.
In February, however, Mr Putra told parliament that BPPC would be unable to
service Rp759bn of soft loans given to it by the central bank. He suggested
a third of clove trees should be cut down to counter over-supply.
BPPC's financial crisis has caused consternation and surprise among
politicians and Indonesia's donor community. Diplomats say many clove
farmers received only half-payment for their crop last year, and BPPC's
income was guaranteed after the government linked the selling of cigarettes
to proof of the purchase of cloves. While BPPC may not have operated at a
profit, diplomats say it does still have financial reserves which, according
to one western ambassador, are held in Singapore bank accounts.
Domestic critics of BPPC have not been exclusively opposition politicians.
Mr Kharis Suhud, speaker of the parliament, has called for the monopoly to
be reviewed. Dr Radius Prawiro, senior economics minister, says that BPPC
must 'repay the debts of the bank'.
'The government cannot take over (BPPC), because then who will repay the
debt? They (BPPC) are responsible,' he says.
Mr Putra is not unique among Mr Suharto's children to head a company with
monopoly rights or to have been the target of criticism. A subsidiary of the
Bimantara Group, chaired by Mr Bambang Trihatmodjo - Mr Suharto's second son
 -enjoys exclusive rights to buy oranges in Kalimantan, formerly Borneo.
A monopoly was granted last October in the collection of television licence
fees to Mekatama Raya, in which Mr Sigit Hardjojudanto, Mr Suharto's eldest
son, is reported to be a shareholder. Mekatama lost the contract, however,
after fees were doubled and the company ceased door-to-door collection and
told people to pay at their local post office.
Defenders of the children say the monopolies issue has been blown out of
proportion. They point to the wide-ranging and profitable companies they
have built and argue that monopolies play only a minor role in their
success. In particular, these supporters say the children have helped reduce
the hold of the ethnic Chinese community over the economy.
Ethnic Chinese account for about 4m of Indonesia's total 183m population but
control many of the largest banks and conglomerates.
'The president and his wife are proud of their children's contribution to
the economy,' explained one senior diplomat.
Bimantara, established by Mr Trihatmodjo in 1982, had estimated revenue in
1991 of Rp2,200bn and about 11,000 employees. Its business interests include
a contract to transport Indonesia's liquefied natural gas (LNG) to South
Korea and construction of a major gas pipeline.
Projects supported by Bimantara include negotiations for a Dollars 1.95bn
power station in East Java, a Dollars 1.6bn olefin plant in West Java, and a
project estimated at Dollars 100m to recycle toxic waste.
The Humpuss Group, Mr Putra's main company, was established in 1984 and had
estimated revenue in 1991 of Rp2,000bn.
Its activities include the shipping of LNG to Taiwan, timber processing and
air transport. Sempati Air, in which Humpuss holds a stake, is the first
private airline to break the monopoly of state-owned Merpati on domestic
jet-powered flights.
Mrs Siti Hardijanti Rukmana, eldest daughter of Mr Suharto, has also been
active in business with companies acting as local partners in major
telecommunication and road construction contracts. In 1991 she helped set up
TPI, a private educational television channel, which now runs in competition
with state television and RCTI, a channel run by the Bimantara group.
There are signs that the children may try to defuse criticism by taking
portions of their companies public. Bimantara is a shareholder in Plaza
Indonesia Realty, an up-market retail and hotel company which this month
floated a minority shareholding.
Shares have been valued at a price/earnings ratio of 23, compared to an
average of about 14 for listed companies. Brokers say state pension funds
were the principal buyers.

SOUTH Korea's economic growth slowed during the first three months of this
year after years of overheating that caused high inflation and large
deficits, AP-DJ reports from Seoul.
According to the Bank of Korea, the central bank, gross national product
during the period rose 7.5 per cent on a yearly basis, compared with 8.7 per
cent a year earlier. The figure also contrasts with an economic growth rate
of 8.4 per cent for the whole of 1991.
A central banker described the level of growth in the first quarter as 'very
desirable' because it approached South Korea's optimum economic growth rate
of 7 per cent.
The slowdown was aided by the government's tight monetary policy, said the
official.
The central bank said in a separate report yesterday that the current
account deficit in April was Dollars 280m (Pounds 158m), compared with
Dollars 960m a year earlier and Dollars 870m a month earlier. This was
mainly because of a sharp slowing in construction.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONG KONG yesterday moved closer to the creation of a monetary authority, or
central bank, when the government said it would set up a discount window to
act as a lender of last resort to the colony's banking system.
The discount window will be administered by the Office of the Exchange Fund,
a government entity which manages the colony's foreign exchange reserves,
sets interest rates and is responsible for maintaining the value of the Hong
Kong dollar.
The move marks a further step in the development of the Exchange Fund into
an active public sector institution monitoring the day-to-day monetary
affairs of the colony. It further erodes the informal style of monetary
management in the colony and the role of Hongkong and Shanghai bank which,
in the past, has acted as the government's agent in times of financial
turbulence.
Mr David Nendick, secretary for monetary affairs, said last night that the
government had no intention of taking away Hongkong Bank's powers to issue
bank notes or manage the bank clearing system in the colony.
Analysts expect the Exchange Fund to evolve into a Hong Kong version of the
Monetary Authority of Singapore before Britain relinquishes sovereignty of
the colony to China in 1997.
The 'liquidity adjustment facility' (LAF), as the discount window is known,
will be introduced on June 8 and will enable banks to make late adjustments
to their liquidity positions. Overnight funds will normally be provided to
banks through sale and repurchase agreements of their holdings of exchange
fund bills and Hong Kong government bonds.

   PERTH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Bond, the fallen idol of corporate Australia, managed a wry smile to
his family before being taken off to the Perth police cells yesterday,
convicted of corporate dishonesty and facing up to five years in prison.
Mr Bond's apparent resilience did little to comfort his former wife Eileen
and children John and Craig, who were clearly upset by a verdict they had
feared but not expected.
But it showed that, in Mr Bond's mind at least, the Alan Bond story may not
yet be over, in spite of the double blow of bankruptcy and a criminal
conviction within two months.
Ironically, it was that kind of determination in the face of adversity which
made Mr Bond the favourite son and most prominent citizen of the Western
Australian city he made his corporate base for more than 30 years.
Starting with a one-man painting company, Mr Bond built an international
media, brewing and property business which made him the best known of
Australia's entrepreneurs. At his peak, he won the 1983 America's Cup, was
rich enough to shower presents worth millions of dollars a year on friends
and family, and was lauded as 'a great Australian' by Mr Bob Hawke, the
former prime minister.
Less than two years ago, he was still chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings,
a quoted flagship with assets of about ADollars 10bn (Pounds 4.1bn), and
Dallhold Investments, a private company with extensive property holdings.
Now Bond Corp is being restructured by its creditors, Dallhold is in
receivership, and Mr Bond is bankrupt, with debts and contingent liabilities
of more than ADollars 700m.
The trigger for his downfall was an ill-advised attack on Lonrho, the
British company managed by Mr Tiny Rowland, which convinced many of Bond
Corp's bankers and creditors that the group was technically deficient.
But the underlying cause was Mr Bond's failure to recognise that the 1987
stock market crash had ended the period in which entrepreneurs could bank on
continually rising asset values to finance their borrowings.
Mr Bond's influence on corporate Australia, and his confidence after the
crash, were exemplified by the rescue of Mr Laurie Connell's Rothwells
merchant bank, which provided the background for the events which led to the
trial.
Rothwells suffered a run on its deposits in the days after the crash, and
would have been unable to continue in business without the rescue, in which
Mr Connell contributed ADollars 70m, shareholders ADollars 150m, and the
state government a further ADollars 150m by way of a guarantee against bank
loans.
Mr Connell told the court that the rescue could not have succeeded without
the participation of Bond Corp, which helped to recruit support from
prominent companies such as Mr John Elliott's Elders IXL (now Foster's
Brewing), Mr Kerry Packer's Consolidated Press Holdings, and Mr Brian
Yuill's Spedley group.
Mr Bond said no one expected the rescue to fail. But Rothwells collapsed
only a year later, setting off a series of inquiries into the way the rescue
was handled, and the close links between politicians and businessmen in
Western Australia.
It was those inquiries which brought Mr Bond to court yesterday, charged
with dishonestly concealing the existence of a ADollars 16m success fee from
a businessman recruited to underwrite Rothwells' share issue.
Mr Bond was the first important business figure to face trial over the
Rothwells rescue, but he will not be the last. Another 19 people have been
charged with more than 250 offences, including Mr Connell, who faces 78
charges.
In addition, a royal commission into Western Australian business links with
politicians is expected to report in October, and further inquiries are
being carried out by the Australian Securities Commission, the federal
corporate watchdog.
Mr Bond will discover today whether he is to serve a prison sentence or pay
a fine of up to ADollars 20,000, or both. Meanwhile, his trustee in
bankruptcy is still trying to trace what happened to millions of dollars
worth of personal assets in Australia, the UK and elsewhere.

MR Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, yesterday set a

the organisation was challenged 'to avoid unrealistic expectations and to
define a sober set of priorities'.
Opening the conference in Johannesburg, Mr Mandela said members of the ANC
were increasingly aware of the resource constraints that would face a future
government, and that there would therefore be 'no quick fix to decades of
apartheid destruction'.
Mr Mandela said the Third World was littered with relics of liberation
movements which had failed at the polls because of unfulfilled promises,
lack of openness in policymaking and through adopting policies which their
countries could not sustain. He said these were valuable lessons for the ANC
to learn.
Mr Mandela also gave notice, however, that the constitutional negotiation
process in South Africa could be entering a difficult phase. The ANC and its
allies were contemplating mass civil protests, possibly including a general
strike, to place pressure on the government.
He gave July as a deadline by which progress should be made in
constitutional talks, and said the conference would consider activities 'to
break the intransigence of the regime'.
The four-day policy conference, being attended by 700 delegates, is the
first such ANC conference since the drafting of the Freedom Charter at
Kliptown in 1955. The charter, a romantic and aspirational document, has
since taken on a totemic importance within ANC ranks. Ms Cheryl Carolus, a
senior ANC official, said the task of the conference was 'to take that
magnificent vision of ours, enshrined in the Freedom Charter, and make it
tangible'.
Mr Mandela also took time to reply to the provisional findings of the
Goldstone Commission, a judicial inquiry into the causes of violence in the
country. Judge Goldstone yesterday delivered a report in which he said the
main cause of violence was the political struggle between the ANC and the
mainly Zulu Inkatha organisation.
Mr Mandela said the findings were superficial in two respects: attributing
blame to the ANC and Inkatha was to ignore the role of the government and
security forces in fostering this rivalry; and suggesting that the ANC and
Inkatha were in the best position to stop the violence was to 'ignore the
reality that it is the National party regime who wields state power'.

FT  29 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Greek exporters take to the sea, air and
narrow road - War in what was Yugoslavia, means finding new routes to
European Community markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KERIN HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR GREEK exporters, war in the former Yugoslavia already means higher
transport costs, fear of goods being hijacked and, for producers of oranges
and cucumbers, a sizeable loss of business.
International sanctions against Serbia are likely to pose further problems
for Greek trade with the European Community, which last year accounted for
two-thirds of total trade worth Dollars 25.8bn (Pounds 14.5bn).
Until last summer, around 40 per cent of Greece's trade with its EC partners
passed through Macedonia and Serbia. In the past 10 months, road haulage
traffic through the northern Greek border has dropped by half, while trains
to Belgrade and Munich no longer run regularly.
Customs officials say that between 100 and 150 international long-distance
TIR trucks used to cross the Yugoslav and Bulgarian borders every day. Now
fewer than 70 go through. Most drivers prefer to take a slow two-lane road
through Bulgaria rather than the Belgrade highway.
Greek exporters and freight forwarders are spending time and ingenuity
devising alternate routes to western Europe that avoid Serbia.
Agreement was reached earlier this year on a new rail route to Austria
through Bulgaria, Romania and Hungary. But problems of time-keeping and
theft still loom large, says Mr Kriton Ioannides of Proodos, a Greek freight
forwarder.
'Quality was lacking: not enough locomotives were available in Romania to be
sure of keeping to schedule; rail freight theft is a problem in all east
Europe countries,' he explains.
Proodos, which imports white goods and cars by rail and exports fruit and
vegetables, organised special trains to travel non-stop between Austria and
Greece with an armed escort aboard.
'We had the train put together at the Austrian border and made sure that, if
it stopped, it would be at a small station where the guards wouldn't be
attacked,' Mr Ioannides said.
Trains can reach Greece in 35 hours, the time taken on the old rail route
through Croatia and Slovenia. Mr Ioannides says higher costs are not enough
to deter traders if it becomes impossible to transit Serbia.
Trucks now take a more expensive time-consuming route, using ferries to
Italy from western Greek ports. But costs are up to 30 per cent higher for
manufactured goods and up to 90 per cent higher for fresh fruit and
vegetables at times when the bulk of a crop becomes available.
At peak points in the season, especially summer when tourists' cars compete
for space with trucks carrying grapes or peaches, not enough ferries are
available.
Also, the small western Greek ports are not equipped to handle large numbers
of TIR trucks. An Igoumenitsa harbour official said: 'Even in January it was
chaos here when the oranges were leaving. We don't have parking space for
more than a handful of 20-tonne trucks.'
Agricultural produce accounts for more than 20 per cent of Greek exports,
with fresh fruit and vegetables the highest earners. But, last winter,
orange exports to the EC fell by 38 per cent to 87,500 tonnes, according to
Incofruit, the exporters' association.
Cucumber exports were down by 37 per cent to 29,700 tonnes. Exports of
oranges to eastern European countries rose by 22 per cent to 157,000 tonnes,
but overall fruit and vegetable earnings still declined to Dollars 352m for
the 1991-92 season, a 6 per cent fall from the previous year.
Mr George Polychronidis, director of Incofruit, estimates that exports of
oranges and cucumbers would have been 20 per cent higher if access to EC
markets had been easier:
'We lost market share in the EC both because of higher transport costs and
poorer quality because the produce was on the road an extra 24 hours. Sales
to eastern Europe can't compensate because prices are much lower and the
market is still very unstable.'
Bumper harvests of cherries and peaches were expected this year, but these
were too expensive to find markets easily in eastern Europe.
Exporters on the island of Crete, which accounts for more than 50 per cent
of Greek fruit and vegetable exports, are planning for the first time to
air-freight produce, aboard charter flights taking European tourists home
from holidays.
After years of resistance to similar proposals, the Greek ministry of
transport last week agreed that tourist charter jets could carry a limited
amount of cargo.
A report by the Chamber of Commerce in Heraklion, Crete's principal town,
estimates that up to 750 tonnes of fruit and vegetables could be shipped
each week to cities in Britain, the Netherlands and Germany.
'Air freight costs twice as much as road and ferry. But we think this can be
covered by the extra value of fruit marketed within a few hours of being
picked,' a Chamber official said.

FT  29 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Japan warns US chip makers over imports
pressure
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S electronics industry might reduce its purchases of US semiconductors
if the US applies 'too much' pressure for increased imports, Japanese
government officials warned yesterday.
The warning follows Washington's decision to review the US-Japan chip pact
and examine ways of improving exporters' access to the Japanese market,
where the foreign share has hovered at 14 per cent for the past year.
Tokyo fears chips will be targeted by Washington during the US presidential
election campaign, in an attempt to show the Bush administration has been
tough on trade with Japan.
The two countries disagree over interpreting the pact, signed last year and
replacing a 1986 agreement. Japan says the wording provides no market share
guarantees; the US chip industry argues the pact needs at least 20 per cent
foreign share by the end of this year.
At the end of last year, the foreign share was 14.4 per cent, with little
chance the 20 per cent figure will be reached. A Ministry of International
Trade and Industry official said: 'If this review doesn't just look at
market share and creates a better understanding about the long-term
relationship between the two industries, we think it may have a good
effect.'
If Washington applied unnecessary pressure, the official said, Japanese
companies would be 'discouraged' and might cut their purchases of foreign
chips. He blamed the stalled market share on the slowing of the domestic
economy and inability of medium-sized US makers to penetrate the Japanese
market.
The Electronic Industries Association of Japan (EIAJ), which is due to meet
US chip industry representatives in Tokyo next week, said some US companies
had sold their chips in Japan, but others have failed to meet customer
specifications.
'A Japanese customer was looking for small and thin chips, but found US
semiconductor companies could not make it. We are collecting stories like
that,' the EIAJ said.

FT  29 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Third world 'faces neglect from industrial
nations'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DEVELOPING countries face a 'period of neglect' from the industrial north
when trade and protectionism will be more important than aid or debt relief
in shaping growth, Sir Peter Leslie, Commonwealth Development Corporation
chairman, said yesterday, David Dodwell, World Trade Editor, reports.
Presenting the annual report of the CDC, the UK government-controlled
organisation channelling aid into private-sector projects in developing
countries, Sir Peter said funds were flowing less freely to the third world
now than in the 1970s and 1980s.
Political and economic reform was the key to attracting investment, with
good governance and an end to corruption important preconditions for aid.
He noted the 'progressive disappearance' of British private investors in
countries where the CDC operates, and warned the protectionist consequences
of a failure of the Uruguay Round trade talks would have 'serious
repercussions' on many of the 68 countries where the CDC has operations.
New investment in 105 projects reached a record Pounds 157.3m in 1991, up
from Pounds 145.9m in 1990, with less than 45 per cent provided from the UK
government's aid programme.
The majority (about Pounds 87m) came from profits earned on past CDC
investments, lifting to Pounds 1.33bn total CDC investments and third world
commitments.
CDC income from investments rose to Pounds 86.9m, from Pounds 83.1m in 1990,
leading to an operating surplus of Pounds 69.9m, up from Pounds 67.2m.
Extraordinary profits of Pounds 22.3m from the sale of long-standing
investments in Thailand and Singapore lifted the surplus transferred to
reserves to Pounds 28.4m, almost four times the 1990 transfer of Pounds
7.7m.
An extraordinary gain of Pounds 45m will be reported next year, following
the sale in April of its shareholding in a Hong Kong container terminal.

<TEXT>
PRODUCTION OF Pepsi bottles will start later this year in the republic of
Belarus under a joint venture officially announced in Moscow yesterday. The
venture, named Belpak, is between Pepsico International and Eastman Chemical
Company, both of the US, and Khimvolokno chemical company and MPOST
synthetic textile enterprise, both of Mogilev, Belarus.
The venture will make plastic bottles for soft drinks and is expected to
produce Dollars 100m (Pounds 56.4m) of investment over the next five years
from hard-currency earnings. The initial investment, which was said to be
'modest', was not disclosed.
From the autumn, Belpak will produce polyethylene terphthalate resin (PET),
a clear recyclable plastic used in making drinks bottles.
Half the production will be used for Pepsi bottles in the former Soviet
Union, while the rest will be exported to west and east Europe for hard
currency.
The hard currency profits will be split equally between the two US partners
and the two Belarus enterprises. Production of the PET resin is expected to
grow to 25,000 metric tonnes annually, equivalent to 500m 2-litre bottles a
year.
Pepsico, the leading soft drinks maker in the former Soviet Union, has a
history of innovative agreements since opening its first facility there in
1974. It trades its soft drink for exports of Stolichnaya vodka and, in the
past two years, commercial ships built in the Ukraine.
Mr Donald Kendall, Pepsico's former chairman, said: 'There is no question
that US and other western companies should come into this market now. People
who wait for political stability or better convertibility of the rouble will
lose out to others.'

FT  29 MAY 92 / Government gives boost to home-grown capitalism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BUDAPEST
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE focus of Hungarian privatisation is to turn inwards, to give preference
to domestic over foreign investors, the government announced yesterday.
Mr Tamas Szabo, Hungary's privatisation minister, launched a battery of
measures designed 'to give a push to local investor demand'.
The most concrete change in policy is an explicit commitment that domestic
investors will be preferred over foreign companies in the case of similar
bids, whereas price was previously the all-important factor.
Further help for domestic investors who cannot afford to buy a state company
outright will come in the form of concessional leasing or option
arrangements.
The new schemes will be financed partly by using Ft16bn (Pounds 110m) of the
Ft57bn (Pounds 392m) of privatisation sale proceeds forecast for 1992.
Hungary has also turned towards Czechoslovak-style privatisation schemes to
spur domestic ownership by distributing some state property rather than
selling it. The government is to hand over state assets to institutions such
as universities, though mass distribution of shares to the public at large
is still not on the agenda.
The change of emphasis comes at a time when both the government and
privatisation itself are increasingly unpopular and marks a concession to
political pressure for home-grown and popular capitalism after two years in
which Hungary has relied almost exclusively on foreign corporate investors
to take property off state hands. Nine out of the top ten privatisations by
value last year were to western companies.
Mr Szabo said that it was necessary to favour domestic investors in order to
preserve the overall momentum of privatisation at a time when public showed
a 'tendency' to suspect foreign economic domination.
A survey this month showed that opinion was divided on privatisation with 39
per cent in favour of selling off state industry and 34 per cent against.
Public attitudes to foreign investment and privatisation have been coloured
by their coincidence with a deep recession which saw gross domestic product
fall by 10 per cent last year.
Hungary has been, until now, the most welcoming of east European countries
to western investment, a stance rewarded by Dollars 3.5bn (Pounds 1.97bn) in
accumulated foreign direct investment, about 60 per cent of the total for
the region as a whole.
The inflow helped boost the private sector to 25-30 per cent of gross
domestic product.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Italy's new president calls for reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Italy's ninth president, yesterday took the
unprecedented step of calling for a constitutional overhaul in his inaugural
address to parliament.
The only president to take an initiative of this kind, the 73-year-old
former Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies left no doubt that he intended to
encourage institutional reform and inject new morality into public life.
'I believe the president's task consists above all else in taking note of
the popular will and, within the constraints of his powers, ensuring this is
translated into valid and effective results,' he said.
That popular will, he noted, had been expressed in the April 5 general
election which saw the traditional political parties humiliated by a large
protest vote.
'In this light, the president of the republic from this moment invites
parliament respectfully but firmly to nominate a commission of the two
houses with a brief to revise the entire institutional framework.'
He also emphasised public morality, in a clear reference to the country's
corruption scandals, notably in Milan. 'The misuse of public funds is a very
serious matter, defrauding honest taxpayers and abusing citizens'
confidence: there is no worse evil, no greater danger to democracy than the
dirty involvement of politics with business.'
Mr Scalfaro was elected on Monday as a compromise candidate proposed by his
Christian Democrat party. He was backed by the four-party Christian
Democrat-led coalition, as well as the former communist Party of the
Democratic Left (PDS), as a candidate whose reputation was untainted by
corruption.
In his speech, Mr Scalfaro also warned of the need for urgent action on the
country's deteriorating finances. He emphasised the risk of failing to
converge with the rest of Italy's EC partners, adding: 'We are well aware
that Europe cannot wait.'
After being sworn in for his seven-year term, Mr Scalfaro drove to the
Quirinale Palace where Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the interim president for the
last month, formally handed over the keys of office.
Mr Scalfaro, a long time widower and devout Catholic, inherits a 16th
century palace with 1,200 rooms used by 30 former Popes, four kings and
eight presidents. The total presidential staff numbers 796 with a budget of
L207bn (Pounds 93.7m) a year. This may well be among the first items to be
subjected to reform and austerity.

<DATELINE>
   TIRASPOL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CHILDREN laid flowers yesterday on four fresh graves of Russian army
officers who died in the fighting in Moldova's breakaway region of Trans
Dnestr.
The graves, in the central square of the region's capital, Tiraspol, seem to
back up Moldovan claims that on May 19 parts of Russia's 14th army began to
fight openly on the side of Trans Dnestr's Slavic separatists.
The war of words escalated over the role of Russian soldiers in the
fighting, as a man was reported killed and three injured in a fresh clash
between the region's largely Slav national guard and Moldovan militia near
the outpost of Bendery.
On Wednesday, President Boris Yeltsin of Russia pledged that the 14th army
would be withdrawn from Moldova, whose strong ties with Bucharest have
aroused fears among the separatists that Trans Dnestr could one day be
swallowed up in a greater Romania. The region declared independence from
Moldova in September 1990.
Mr Mircea Snegur, the president of Moldova, yesterday described Mr Yeltsin's
move as 'a victory for commonsense', but said he feared Russian hardliners
might block the withdrawal.
The Trans Dnestr Womens' Defence Committee, which has been collecting
weapons from unprotesting soldiers at Russian army barracks, said it had
been assured by 14th army officials that the soldiers would not withdraw
until the conflict was over. Over 100 people have died in the fighting in
the past four months.
A defiant Mr Igor Smirnov, president of the breakaway republic, said
yesterday he expected soldiers and officers from the 14th army to remain in
the region and join the Trans Dnestr armed forces. That manpower, combined
with Trans Dnestr's strong industrial base which Mr Smirnov said is being
geared to military production, would be enough to defend the republic if the
14th army pulled out, he said. Mr Smirnov said entire units of the 14th army
might join the separatist side.
Guarded by khaki-clad young men toting Kalashnikovs, Mr Smirnov said
officers from the right bank of the Dnestr river, where Moldova has taken
over most former Soviet forces, had defected to the Trans Dnestr military.
Mr Smirnov did not deny Moldovan allegations that the war was costing Trans
Dnestr 1m roubles a day but said that funds from Russian enterprises and
individuals were offsetting the cost.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Danes wonder if it's time to get off the Eurowagon: Many
voters are having second thoughts about EC unity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MANY Danes, Europe appears to be rolling in the wrong direction. A
majority of them may be about to stop the unity bandwagon just long enough
for their country to jump off.
Next Tuesday Danish voters decide in a binding referendum whether to accept
or reject the Maastricht treaty agreed last December. The vote represents
the first direct test of public opinion on the European union treaty in any
of the 12 EC member states. It poll will be followed by a referendum in
Ireland on June 18, and, possibly, by one in France later in the summer.
The Danes - traditional Euro-sceptics - are showing strong signs of
post-Maastricht irritation. In the first three weeks of May, opinion surveys
consistently showed small majorities against the treaty. A May 26 Gallup
poll, however, indicated 41 per cent in favour, 39 per cent against.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the foreign minister, and Denmark's most
enthusiastic and tireless pro-Maastricht campaigner, dismisses as irrelevant
speculation of a negative vote. 'None of it matters, for there will be a
Yes. The Danish people have got too much sense to say No,' he declares.
Even if Mr Ellemann is right, the pro-Europe vote seems almost certain to be
much smaller than on the two previous occasions when Danes were consulted
about European policies. In the 1972 referendum on EC membership, 63 per
cent of votes were in favour of joining the Community. In 1986, in the poll
on the Single European Act, 56 per cent of voters said Yes.
There are many reasons for anti-Maastricht feeling. They range from
complaints about the European Commission's strictures on sales of
over-curvaceous cucumbers to fears that, in a federal Europe, Denmark will
be dominated by 80m Germans.
Critics of Maastricht advance arguments on policies which will not be
directly implemented by the treaty. These include establishing a European
army and proceeding to economic and monetary union (which Denmark would join
only after yet another referendum). Above all, opposition focuses on worries
about loss of sovereignty and self-determination, and general antipathy to
the Brussels bureaucracy.
Opinion polls indicate a striking gulf between the people and the political
and corporate establishment. The Folketing (parliament) voted by a
comfortable 130 votes to 25 to ratify the treaty. The trade unions, all the
main business organisations and almost every newspaper of any consequence
are urging the electorate to vote in favour. The voters appear unimpressed.
The campaign against Maastricht is headed by the two parties which voted
against in the Folketing. These are the populist right-wing Progress Party,
which wants to keep the Community as it is, and the left-wing, erstwhile
Marxist, Socialist People's Party.
The opposition Social Democratic Party and the unions are in a particular
dilemma. They support Maastricht, but two thirds or more of their normal
supporters are against.
The Confederation of Danish Trade Unions was even forced to cancel a
pro-Maastricht demonstration in Copenhagen on May 22. It feared a repeat of
events on May Day, when its chairman, Mr Finn Thorgrimson, had to break off
his speech because of a barrage of catcalls and rotten fruit.
If Denmark votes No on June 2, what would be the effect on the rest of
Europe? As a first step, on June 3 the Irish government would be expected to
ask the other members to reaffirm their commitment to the treaty. Although
this would require a new treaty excluding Denmark, the signals are that the
other 11 members of the Community will implement European union whatever the
outcome of the Danish vote.
Denmark might then have to accept an associate membership agreement along
the lines of the European Economic Area deal with the Efta countries,
according to Mr Henning Christophersen, the Danish EC commissioner.
Legally as well as practically, a two-tier European union would create
enormous problems. Denmark as a signatory to the Rome Treaty would be
represented in some EC bodies but not others.
Mr Niels Ersboll, the Danish secretary-general to the European Commission,
argues that such an outcome would be unsustainable. Denmark would then, he
says, be detached from the Rome Treaty institutions as well.
Supporters of the treaty such as Mr Christophersen and Mr Ersboll
ceaselessly deploy the argument that Denmark cannot afford to be left out on
the Maastricht road. One obstacle may, however, be particularly difficult to
surmount: far more women are against the treaty than in favour. Perhaps,
quips Mr Ellemann-Jensen, because virtually all the people telling them to
say Yes are men.

<TEXT>
MARS, the US-owned confectionery maker, yesterday lost a round in its legal
battle over the European ice cream market when the Irish High Court ruled
that the Anglo-Dutch Unilever group was entitled to bar Mars products from
its retail freezer cabinets.
The ruling follows a European Commission decision two months ago that
Langnese-Iglo, a Unilever subsidiary, and Scholler Lebensmittel, another
German ice-cream maker, were acting illegally by maintaining exclusive ties
with German retailers which kept Mars products out of their stores.
The Commission also reached an interim decision that exclusive freezer
agreements operated by Unilever - Europe's biggest ice-cream maker -
infringed EC competition law.
Mars yesterday sought to overturn a two-year-old Irish court injunction
preventing it from putting its ice cream into freezers owned by HB Ice
Cream, an Irish Unilever subsidiary.
However, the High Court said the injunction did not violate EC or Irish law.
Mars said it would appeal against the ruling before the Irish Supreme Court
and possibly in the European Court of Justice.
It also expressed confidence that the EC Commission would decide formally to
prohibit exclusive freezer agreements.

Prices on Shanghai's stock exchange have dropped 19 per cent in the past
three days, after the authorities attempted to ban investment syndicates
suspected of ramping share prices. A week ago prices doubled in a single day
when the exchange removed limits on daily price movements.
The exchanges in Shanghai and in Shenzhen special economic zone, close to
Hong Kong, have caught the imagination of the Chinese, many of whom have
substantial savings and are looking for ways to put their money to
profitable use.
Many other cities, including Guangzhou, capital of prosperous Guangdong
province, have applied to open stock exchanges. The authorities in Beijing
are adopting a cautious approach and officials believe that any new
exchanges approved will be in the north.
Shanghai lists 'A' shares, which can be traded by Chinese, in only 14
companies, and 'B' shares, which can be traded by foreigners, in one of
them. A further 15 'A' shares and six 'B' shares are listed in Shenzhen.
With the opportunities for investment so limited, the prices of shares have
soared.
Although the exchanges have been open for 18 months, trading this year has
become frenzied following Beijing's endorsement of accelerated economic
reform and as a result of growing prosperity in the south. There is growing
interest in the markets from investors in other provinces.
Investors see share trading as a way to make quick money in a country which
offers few profitable avenues for investment. Communist officials in
provinces all over China see share ownership as a means to mobilise savings
to back economic reform, to revitalise grossly inefficient state industries
and to emulate the booming south.
Many officials seem unabashed by the volatility in the existing fledgling
markets, and the exchanges themselves are planning a large number of new
listings.
The mayhem in Shenzhen has seen one murder and hundreds of arrests as the
authorities cracked down on gangsters who were fighting for places in queues
outside brokers' offices - queue positions were being traded as well as
shares. In Shanghai, one man committed suicide after losing 6,000 yuan
(Dollars 1,000).

UNITED NATIONS troops should not provide protection for humanitarian aid
efforts in Bosnia-Hercegovina, according to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the
United Nations secretary-general.
The recommendation that the Security Council reject a European Community
request for armed intervention came as diplomats put the finishing touches
to a package of UN sanctions against Serbia to end the war.
While acknowledging it was for the Security Council to make a final
decision, Mr Boutros Ghali warned that it would require large numbers of UN
troops to secure several hundred kilometres of roads and to establish a
defensive perimeter around the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. The city has been
cut off by Serb militia and Yugoslav army troops in a bid to starve it into
submission.
There was a lull in the fighting around Sarajevo yesterday after heavy
overnight clashes. In a bid to distance itself from the mortar attack on
Sarajevo on Wednesday which left 17 people dead and 80 wounded, the rump
Yugoslav presidency yesterday called on the UN to investigate the
'massacre'.
However, diplomatic moves to impose mandatory sanctions could reach fruition
as early as today, according to Mr John Major, the prime minister.
Speaking in Budapest after talks on the crisis with Mr Joszef Antall, the
Hungarian prime minister, Mr Major said that the sanctions were likely to
include a trade embargo, a freeze on Serbia's overseas assets, severe
restrictions on commercial flights, the suspension of all official sporting
contacts and the break-off of scientific, technical and cultural
co-operation.
The terms of the resolution under discussion by UN ambassadors in New York
also included provision for an oil embargo from the middle of next month if
Serbia did not act to halt the fighting. Mr Major said that the precise
terms of the resolution were still under discussion, 'But I hope it will be
agreed by the United Nations by the end of this week . . . that it will be a
binding and mandatory series of sanctions.'
Mr Boutros Ghali urged the Security Council to bear in mind that authorising
hostile action against 'certain factions' in Bosnia-Hercegovina could make
it more difficult to secure the co-operation needed for the UN to fulfil its
mandate in the protected areas in Croatia.
A 'less ambitious possibility' would be to use UN troops to protect relief
convoys between Sarajevo airport and distribution centres in the city, he
said.
A more promising course would be a determined effort to persuade the warring
parties to conclude and honour agreements permitting unimpeded delivery of
aid to 'all suffering civilians,' said the secretary-general.
However, numerous efforts to secure ceasefires have failed after Serb
militias and the Yugoslav army have prevented any supplies which have been
sent from reaching Sarajevo.
In Belgrade the Serbian Orthodox Church attacked the policies of President
Slobodan Milosevic in an unprecedented open letter.
The church, which had supported the nationalist politics of Mr Milosevic,
yesterday appealed for his resignation and the formation of a government of
national salvation.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (10): Poland sets the pattern -
Eastern Europe's move towards convertible currencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN exchange trading in the former communist world from the Elbe to the
Pacific Ocean used to be either a state-controlled rip-off or a furtive,
back-street affair with money changers who were often secret policemen in
disguise.
The Poles were the most blatant and competitive of black-market dealers and
it was entirely appropriate therefore that Poland became the first of the
post-communist regimes to make its currency, the zloty, internally
convertible and turn foreign exchange dealing over to the private sector.
Poland's trail-blazing liberalisation of its foreign exchange market was an
essential element in the IMF-backed economic stabilisation programme which
began on January 1, 1990. Backed by a Dollars 1bn currency stabilisation
fund provided by western governments and financial institutions the exchange
rate of the zloty was fixed at 9,500 to the dollar, the rate at which it was
trading on the black market.
To general surprise the once-despised socialist currency then appreciated in
real terms for the next 17 months as the internal purchasing power of the
zloty was eroded by inflation while its external value remained fixed. Then
came the first devaluation in May last year followed by introduction of a
crawling peg system which devalues the currency by around 1.8 per cent a
month.
While the central bank maintains this controlled floating regime, actual
trading is carried out in thousands of privately-owned exchange booths and
commercial bank counters equipped with real-time computer terminals which
compete fiercely over their spreads to attract custom.
The success of Poland's bold experiment in foreign exchangeliberalisation
and internal convertibility was followed in a quieter way by several other
former Soviet satellites. In no case, however, has full convertibility been
introduced, involving capital account transactions and non-residents.
Hungary also comes close to full convertibility in practice, however, with
non-residents guaranteed the right to repatriate Forint earnings on direct
and portfolio investments. But even Hungary maintains token limitations on
residents obtaining foreign currency for business or travel purposes and it
remains far easier to change hard currency into local currencies than vice
versa.
The introduction of varying degrees of internal convertibility throughout
eastern and central Europe has been accompanied by the collapse of trade
denominated in the now-defunct transferable rouble and a sharp rise in trade
with hard currency markets. This has led to a corresponding increase in
export-import financing and foreign exchange trading volume.
Between the last quarter of 1989, which saw the destruction of the Berlin
Wall, and the end of the second quarter of 1991 the three central European
countries, Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary, which are now associate
members of the European Community, saw their exports to the OECD area rise
by between 13 and 35 per cent, with a corresponding rise in foreign exchange
transactions.
But the most important development in foreign exchange trading is due on
July 1 when the Russian government takes the first big step towards
introducing convertibility for the rouble.
For decades the act of even taking rouble banknotes out of the Soviet Union
was considered a serious criminal offence. Tourists and businessmen alike
were only allowed to change money at a grotesquely over-valued rate while
the gigantic bureaucracies which dealt with foreign trade were tied up in
knots by an incredibly complex structure of foreign trade co-efficients and
other bureaucratic nonsense.
This created a thicket of differing exchange rates which bore no
relationship at all to any concept of market value and made it impossible
for the Soviet authorities to have any rational foreign trade policy.
On July 1, all these various artificial exchange rates will be abolished and
replaced by a single, albeit floating, rate of exchange. The idea is for the
rouble to float for a few months to get an idea of its approximate market
value and then to fix a central rate within a 7.5 per cent fluctuation band.
This is expected 'sometime this autumn', according to Mr Georgy Matiukhin,
the chairman of the Russian central bank.
A huge amount of work remains to be done to train the necessary staff and
set up the infrastructure required to ensure orderly foreign exchange
trading across this huge country extending over nine time zones from St
Petersburg in the west to Sakhalin or Vladivostok in the east, with key oil-
and gas-producing, and therefore hard-currency-earning, Siberia in the
middle.
The new convertible rouble will be the currency of Russia, the largest, and
potentially the richest, of the 15 former Soviet republics which made up the
defunct Soviet Union . Those of the former Soviet republics who want to
remain within the 'rouble zone' will have to play by the rules hammered out
in the inter-republican central bankers' commission where Russia, with its
huge energy and raw material resources, has the most influential voice.
Russia's pre-eminence will be reinforced by the imminent steep rise in the
rouble price of its energy and raw material exports to the other former
Soviet republics. Those republics, like the Baltic states and Ukraine, which
have no oil or gas of their own, will inevitably run up deficits with
Russia. But Moscow's willingness to supply the necessary rouble credits will
depend on the willingness of other republics to play by the new monetary
rules which will accompany rouble convertibility.
As the terms of trade move sharply in Russia's favour the other republics
will have to step up exports to Russia and agree to tight monetary and other
disciplines. In this way, Russia will almost certainly re-assert its
hegemony over the former Soviet republics and enforce economic
re-integration of the rouble zone through a combination of higher energy
prices and convertibility.
If this prognosis is correct the prospect of the former Soviet republics
being able to introduce their own national currencies will be much reduced.
Latvia was the first to introduce its own parallel currency in a move which
the IMF described as 'economic suicide'. The other Baltic states, Estonia
and Lithuania, have similar plans alongside the Ukraine which initially
created a semi-Ukrainian currency by sticking coupons on existing rouble
banknotes. This was essentially part of a rationing system to give nationals
priority access to scarce food and other items, but plans are advanced for
the introduction of the Hryvnia as a fully-fledged national currency.
But the introduction of new currencies is shrouded in considerable
controversy. Mr Matiukhin, diplomatically commented that in the beginning at
least, the new currencies are likely to be as independent as the Scottish
pounds, issued by several Scottish banks, but only under strict Bank of
England control.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (12): Optimism about union dims -
Europe has embarked on the arduous task of making Emu a reality
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRAMA is over; now comes the hard work. After the excitement of the
Maastricht summit at the end of last year which settled on the terms for
European economic and monetary union, Europe has embarked on the arduous
task of making Emu a reality.
In its third and final phase, Emu is aimed at ushering in a single currency
for a large part of western Europe. Monetary policy across the region would
be set by a new European Central Bank (ECB).
According to the Maastricht timetable, the final phase is to start up
between 1997 and 1999. It would involve a core group of countries - not
necessarily the whole of the existing European Community - with membership
of the union set by which countries wish to join and how many meet the
economic criteria.
As a prelude to phase three, stage two of Emu is intended to start in 1994
with the creation of a European Monetary Institute (EMI). This body will be
based on the existing committee of European central bank governors, and will
oversee policy co-ordination and preparation for the final phase.
Ultimately, the EMI would evolve into the ECB.
Progress towards Emu has been disrupted by a variety of developments:
Political arguments. In several community nations a debate has broken out -
rather late, given the detail of the Emu protocol sketched out at Maastricht
 -about whether handing over monetary sovereignty to the new pan-European
central bank is in their interests. Discussion along these lines will
surface during the rest of the year, when the Maastricht treaty is due to be
ratified in all 12 EC countries.
Particular worries are being expressed in Germany - Europe's strongest
economic power - over whether Germany's interests will best be served by
giving up the D-Mark for the uncertainties of a single European currency. It
looks as though the Maastricht terms will be subject to ratification by the
German parliament around 1996.
This will probably give Germany the same powers to opt out of Emu as Britain
has by dint of the special treaty clause which it negotiated at Maastricht.
Since an Emu without Germany would look like Hamlet without the Prince, the
rumblings from Germany could easily scupper the project.
High borrowing. Inflationary forces in several EC countries remain strong,
much of this due to the rising prices sparked in Germany by unification in
1990. That has led the German Bundesbank to increase interest rates, leading
to tight monetary policies across much of the rest of Europe and weakening
growth prospects.
As a result, several European countries, particularly Belgium, Italy and
Ireland, may find it difficult to reduce government borrowing quickly enough
to meet the tough fiscal targets set as part of the Emu timetable. According
to the Maastricht fiscal policy criteria, countries should bring down their
budget deficits to no more than 3 per cent of gross domestic product while
outstanding government debt is required not to exceed 60 per cent of GDP.
Effects of high interest rates. The high German rates have - due to
Germany's anchor role in the European Monetary System - required other
countries to keep their borrowing rates high also. Some regard this
development as underlining the inherent lack of flexibility in semi-fixed or
fixed exchange rate systems. They contend the problems would be still worse
in a monetary union with only one currency for Europe. In the past year or
so the problems of high German interest rates have been particularly intense
for countries such as Britain, France and Italy which in all cases would
probably have liked to cut rates to stimulate their flagging economies.
Role of the ECB. There remains much work to be done on defining the powers
of the bank - especially in the area of financial regulation and acting as a
lender of last resort. If the bank is to function efficiently, it may also
need to play a part in the area of pan-European fiscal policy, a role which
could place it in conflict with national governments.
Lack of economic convergence. Emu will make sense only if the nations that
seek to enter a union have similar economic performances, as measured by
criteria such as growth and inflation. The Maastricht protocol set out tough
specific criteria that have to be met if countries want to join Emu. These
include the stipulation that average inflation over one year in each member
nation should be within 1 1/2 percentage points of the rate of the three or
fewer European countries where inflation is lowest.
But there is a question mark over the number of countries likely to make
progress in moving closer to each other on such criteria. In particular,
this could make it difficult for some of the southern European nations such
as Portugal and Greece to qualify.
If such countries made such a determined effort to meet the inflation
criteria that they opted for policies which led to large rise in
unemployment, then it could be argued that the social costs of meeting the
Emu conditions are too high.
Practical details. No one has worked out the arrangements for minting or
printing the coins and notes of the new European currency units. Also to be
settled would be the way in which pounds, D-Marks and francs  - assuming
these currencies are ultimately subsumed in a monetary union - are replaced
by the new currency. The decisions would have to focus not only on ordinary
transactions at the consumer level but on arrangements for financial markets
covering currencies and bonds. Bearing in mind the huge disruption which can
be entailed by just one nation changing currency - as happened in Britain in
1971 when it introduced a new decimal coinage - the potential for
difficulties in this area could be immense.
Emu optimists can, however, point to one area where the Emu process has got
off to a reasonable start. The exchange rate mechanism of the European
Monetary System has proved successful in keeping its 10 member currencies
within set limits according to either 6 per cent or 2.25 per cent
fluctuation bands. The ERM is a vital part of planning for Emu; assuming Emu
proceeds as planned at Maastricht, ultimately the ERM should disappear to be
replaced by a system of irrevocably locked exchange rates. In other words,
the room for fluctuation in the current bands would be brought down to zero,
leading to the single currency.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (11): Still only a distant dream
/ A look at prospects for the Ecu becoming widely used
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEE-SAWING prospects of the Maastricht treaty on economic and monetary
union (Emu) being ratified by all 12 EC parliaments this year have been
reflected in the health of the Ecu, which the treaty set as Europe's single
currency by the end of the century.
The Ecu currency basket itself remains stable. Eight currencies that account
for 80 per cent of the Ecu's weighting are within the narrow fluctuation
band of the European exchange rate mechanism. In addition, Maastricht agreed
to make no further changes in the Ecu's composition. This is not a major
move, but one which will prevent a recurrence of the slowdown in Ecu market
activity that used to precede the five-yearly revision of the Ecu basket.
It is the Ecu bond market which has acted as a bellwether of Maastricht's
perceived political fortunes. Just after Maastricht, Ecu bond yields
decreased as investors took the long view that the Ecu would be just about
as solid as the D-mark - simply because it would have to be, if Germany was
going to let the former replace the latter. But in March, as doubts began to
creep in about Maastricht surviving the referendum in Denmark and getting a
two-thirds majority in the Bundestag, the spread between Ecu and D-Mark bond
yields widened.
The enthusiasm for Ecu bonds as a financial instrument stayed high this
year. In the first quarter, primary issues totalled an impressive Ecu10.8bn,
though down on the record Ecu14.9bn issued in the same period of 1991. The
yield curve was filled at either end, with the French Treasury launching
Ecu1.5bn worth of 30-year OAT notes and the UK Treasury issuing Ecu1bn worth
of three-year notes. Over the past couple of years, the EC has stepped up
its own Ecus issues, with balance of payments loans to Greece and eastern
Europe and with European Investment Bank lending increasing to the latter
region. EC central banks, too, are making more use of the official Ecu in
intervention, buying and selling it against their national currencies.
But there is still almost no private use of the Ecu. The past two years have
seen minor advances, with the Eurocontrol air traffic control organisation
starting to bill airline companies in Ecus, and some 18 European railway
companies adopting the Ecu as the accounting unit between themselves. Yet,
less than 1 per cent of EC exports are invoiced in Ecus.
At this stage, therefore, the European Commission's dream of the Ecu
becoming the world's top currency still seems distant. A 1990 Commission
report forecast that Emu might, in various ways, lead to a flow into the Ecu
of nearly Dollars 500bn. This, it speculated, could be the result of
EC countries being able to dispense with Dollars 200bn in official reserves;
An increase of Dollars 35bn in seigniorage (income derived from issuing
interest-bearing assets) as non-Europeans decide to hold Ecus in cash as a
store of value;
Fund and portfolio managers diversifying into Ecus to the tune of perhaps
Dollars 200bn;
Increased use of the Ecu, roughly Dollars 60bn worth, in trade payments. The
development of Ecu-denominated trade would reduce EC traders' foreign
exchange risk, and give EC banks more scope to provide services in their own
currency around the world.
Though all this may be far off, there is at least growing interest in the
Ecu in European Free Trade Association (Efta) countries, several of whom
have applied to join the EC. Between October 1990 and June 1991, Norway,
Sweden and Finland decided to peg their currencies to the Ecu; Austria, for
its part, has attached the schilling to the D-Mark. Further afield, Iceland
has apparently been weighing a link to the Ecu, even though the US dollar
makes up 18 per cent of the trade-weighted currency basket it uses at the
moment. Malta, which is an EC applicant, has not formally linked its money
to the Ecu, but Ecu-component currencies have a majority weighting in the
currency basket it uses. While it may make sense for central European
countries to peg currencies to the Ecu, Warsaw, Prague and Budapest do not
have the financial markets to handle such an operation.
The three main Nordic countries would like associate membership of the
European Monetary System, which EC states have so far resisted, partly
because if they created such a status, it would be hard to deny it to
others. Norway has, in fact, negotiated the essence of associate membership
by organising swap credits with several EC central banks. Finland may want
to do the same, particularly after its rocky start with the Ecu; it had to
devalue the markka heavily against the Ecu this year. Sweden is still
pushing for formal status as an EMS associate, to obtain a multilateral swap
arrangement which would otherwise have to be negotiated bilaterally.
But it is idle to think the Ecu will 'take off' outside the Community before
it 'takes off' inside. Mr Andre Louw, one of the Commission's Ecu
specialists, says there are still obstacles to greater use of the Ecu. Chief
of these is that Germany still regards it as a currency index, not a true
foreign currency. As a result, it is still not possible to write a cheque or
contracts in Ecus which is enforceable in German courts. Some other
countries, particularly Belgium, Spain (which only recently lifted exchange
controls), Greece (which still has them), actually allow residents to
perform in Ecus transactions that are not allowed in other foreign
currencies.
But Belgium, which has issued some Ecu coins as legal tender, does not allow
companies to denominate their capital in Ecus. Luxembourg does, but only two
firms have done so. Mr Louw also complains that banks, mistakenly, fail to
promote the Ecu. 'When we get the Ecu, banks will lose from no longer being
able to trade national (EC) currencies, but they will gain far more from an
enormous increase in trading the Ecu against the dollar and yen, in Ecu
deposit/credit banking and in Ecu bond trading,' he says.
'The problem is to generate a circuit, so that if you generate revenue in
Ecu, you can spend it in Ecu.'

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (8): Drawing a line on currency /
Profile of Simon Crane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIMON Crane spends his days looking out for abandoned babies, shooting
stars, flags, pennants, crows and candlesticks.
Mr Crane is a chart analyst, one of the much-maligned, but now indispensable
technical observers of foreign exchange movements. The flags, babies and
stars are different ways of describing the lines he puts on paper.
Yet Mr Crane is anxious to avoid colourful language. It creates confusion
over what chartists are about, he says. In Mr Crane's words, forex chartists
aim to show where the risk or profit on a particular currency lies within a
given period, and where the market is at that particular time.
'The market is a big playing field,' he says. 'Everyone knows where the ball
is, and where the goalposts are. What they do not know is where the pitch is
or just where the boundaries are.'
The key to drawing charts is past performance. 'With a monotonous
regularity, the same picture occurs,' says Mr Crane. Using a measurement of
performance, the chartist aims to make a projection about what might happen
in the future, he says.
Critics of charts - who disparagingly refer to the discipline as the
'autopilot approach' - would hold that Mr Crane's job takes little account
of the unquantifiable factors such as politics and sentiment affecting
exchange rates.
Mr Crane argues no chartist would ignore such factors. 'At the end of the
day, you are analysing the psychology and dynamics of the market,' he says.
'There is no scientific method of interpreting charts.'
However, there is one golden rule and that is: 'The market is always right'.
Such a rule applies as much to fundamentalists as to chartists, he says, and
each faction would be wrong to ignore the other.
Differences of opinion merely fuel Mr Crane's enthusiasm. He maintains that
among the 25 banks and corporations which his company - Crane Investment
Analysis (CIA) - lists as clients, there are a healthy number who disagree
with what he says. Yet they still come back, because most traders will not
ignore the risk parameters as defined by detailed charts. 'We define where
the resistance is, where the support is . . . and make a judgment as to how
much pace is behind the current move.'
On a given day, Mr Crane could work with hundreds of charts. The aptly-named
CIA - Mr Crane keeps his methods secret even from close friends - deals also
with the precious metals, capital markets and equity markets. However, the
bulk of his analysis deals with currencies and capital markets.
To the sceptics, Mr Crane says charting is likely to become an increasingly
important tool for foreign exchange trading.
Technical analysis is essential, he says, 'in a market place where a large
percentage of any given currency move occurs over increasingly shorter time
frames'; and in a market worth some Dollars 700bn a day and growing,
according to his own calculations, traders will find it more and more
difficult to ignore any help they can get.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (6): The Square Mile stays out in
front / Discussing London's role as a leading financial centre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE CITY of London has long been proud, if not cocksure, of its reputation
as a leading foreign exchange trading centre.
Brochures published by the Corporation of London boast that London's Square
Mile can still claim to be the world's leading international financial
centre.
But political and financial developments in Europe alongside Britain's
general antipathy towards monetary union have led some to suggest that
London's continuing dominance in foreign exchange trading is in question.
The main concerns over London losing its competitive edge are that the
European Central Bank will be located in another European city and that the
British government will continue to be hostile towards monetary union.
On closer examination, both concerns appear overblown. The Bank of England,
anyway not yet resigned to the ECB going elsewhere, brushes off suggestions
that London's dominant role in global foreign exchange trading would be
weakened if another city were chosen to house the ECB.
The Bank says London's underlying advantages will continue to give the City
an edge over other European centres.
After all, where the bank is located is less important than where it
operates. In the US, the Federal Reserve is based in Washington, but
operates mainly through the largest, most developed and highly securitised
market - New York. The same would surely be true of Europe.
According to the most recent survey of foreign exchange market activity
carried out by the Bank of International Settlements in 1989, the City is
only just behind Tokyo in total international banking business.
In foreign exchange trading, the UK ranked first, with total daily foreign
exchange transactions amounting to Dollars 187bn. This compared with
turnovers of Dollars 129bn in New York and Dollars 115bn in Tokyo. In
Europe, leaving aside London, only Zurich recorded a turnover of more than
Dollars 50bn.
On this basis, the Corporation of London says it is 'hardly surprising' that
'foreign banks have flocked to London, providing the essential cement to the
international flavour of the City'.
There are more than 500 foreign bank branches, incorporations or
representative offices based in London's square mile. Perhaps the most
prestigious of all is the latest international recruit, the headquarters of
the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development, with shareholders from
more than 40 countries.
Although the Bank of England believes the City would weather the location of
Europe's central bank outside the UK, it continues to argue strongly that it
should come to London.
In a speech earlier this year, Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the
Bank of England, said it would be in the interests of the European Community
to have its central bank placed in London.
'A single European currency would be one of the world's three major
currencies, and would obviously be actively traded in centres around the
world . . . London is one of the three major world financial centres,
perhaps the only truly international centre and certainly the pre-eminent
international centre in Europe, with a depth, variety and liquidity in its
money and capital markets - which very much now embrace and are developing
the Ecu - that will be vital to an effective single monetary policy,' he
said.
If the ECB does go to one of the so-called 'compromise' candidates, the
'Domesday' scenario is that much of London's foreign exchange trade will go
with it.
'Much depends on what the European Central Bank actually does,' says Ruth
Lea chief economist at Mitsubishi bank in London. 'Will it be just for
committee meetings, or will it be a major operating unit?'
Whatever its role, she dismisses the worst-case scenario; 'I think London
will remain the biggest centre in Europe but it will inevitably lose an edge
if the ECB goes elsewhere.'
Mr Gerard Lyons, chief economist at DKB International, says the Japanese
bank is similarly unflustered at the prospect of London's future.
'There are enough reasons to be positive about London's role - liquidity is
the key factor and London already has that plus a lot of expertise in
foreign exchange. Its infrastructure as an international financial centre
has already been proven,' says Mr Lyons.
However, he cautions that even with these in-built advantages, the location
of the ECB is still important and could yet affect London's position.
'If the ECB is based in a city which clearly doesn't have the potential to
become the European financial centre, like Amsterdam for example, then there
will be no threat to London, but if it goes to Frankfurt, which does have
the potential, then that could pose some sort of problem.'
As for Britain's antipathy towards monetary union, few in the City feel that
London's position in foreign exchange trading would be put in jeopardy if
Britain were to opt out of Emu.
'An awful lot of London's business is offshore business,' said a spokesman
from the Bank of England. 'Because it is an offshore centre, there is every
reason to believe it will continue to be one even if we were not in Emu.'
There is also growing scepticism over the timetable for Emu set out in the
Maastricht treaty. Many in the City view it as unrealistic, and are
confident that no big financial houses would even consider making a move
elsewhere in Europe while the future of monetary union looks so uncertain.
In fact, worries over the attitude of the British government towards Europe
are likely, at least for the time being, to be outweighed by the more
comforting prospect of five years of political stability following the
decisive victory of the Conservative party in the April general election,
especially when compared with the relatively turbulent political outlook
elsewhere in Europe.
Other reasons tying financial houses to London are the exceedingly high
costs now sunk into London. It would take some good reasons indeed for a
company to undertake the enormous cost of relocating its European base.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (7): Risk-taking is his business
 -Profile of Julian Simmonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUESDAY, mid-morning; Citibank's London foreign exchange dealing room is
humming. Smart, young traders bark instructions to each other from opposite
sides of the room, others gaze at flickering green screens, pensively
twirling their telephone handsets.
Presiding over the hubbub from a dealing post bang in the middle of the
spot-desk, is Mr Julian Simmonds, Citibank's energetic managing director of
foreign exchange and money markets in Europe.
After almost 20 years in foreign exchange trading and sales, Mr Simmonds
still approaches his job with the zeal of a newcomer.
'At the end of the day, I actually enjoy my job and I enjoy the people I
work with. If I didn't, I wouldn't bother to get up in the mornings,' he
says.
Responsible for all of Citibank's foreign exchange and funding activities in
Europe, Mr Simmonds' presence in the dealing room and the fact that he
continues to take a position on currencies, is testimony to his love of
risk-taking and ability to avoid, as far as possible, the administrative
side of management.
'Like any other large organisation there is a real risk at senior levels of
management of getting dragged away from your desk,' he says. 'One of my key
challenges is to not allow myself to become engulfed in a sea of papers and
meetings. You can't watch the market if you are stuck in meetings.'
The approach means that he can stay in touch with his workforce and with
Citibank's customers. Understanding customers' needs has become a key part
of Simmonds' approach to forex trading.
'I don't believe the business of banking is any different from other service
industries,' says Mr Simmonds. 'The product we are trying to sell is foreign
exchange. I approach the challenge by thinking, what is it I want when I go
into a mojor store to make a big acquisition?'
One initiative has been to survey customers' needs through a questionnaire.
Mr Simmonds reads every single return, tackling weak areas directly with the
sales, trading and administrative teams.
All this makes him a busy man. He is into the office by 7.45am and tries to
be home by 6.15pm. When away from his desk, he regularly glances at a
portable Reuters screen that he carries with him everywhere. At night he is
frequently woken by traders keeping him in touch with his position.
Two things help - he claims not to need much sleep and he has an
understanding wife.
Certainly Mr Simmonds, a vigorous 41, shows no sign of the 'burn-out' often
associated with the frantic life of forex risk-takers.
'Burn-out comes from excessive alcohol and entertainment, not from the
work,' he says. 'I am only prepared to entertain in the evenings where it is
important, and wherever possible I try to involve my wife.'
Family life is important. 'When the kids tell me about their latest crisis
at school, it puts the job in perspective.'
The only downside of the job to which Mr Simmonds is devoted, he says, is
failure. 'But it's a risk business, and failing is something you have to
learn to live with.
'You have to do what you think best in the business. If I buy dollars
because I think the dollar is going up, and I make a mistake, then I can
live with it. I am disappointed, but I can live with it,' he says.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (2): Well set to weather storms -
Dollar
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR has this year weathered some unexpected economic and political
turbulence at home and abroad. This suggests that the US currency may be
able to withstand any storms that lie ahead during the rest of 1992.
Since January, the dollar has appreciated steadily against the currencies in
the D-Mark bloc and against the yen in spite of disruptive and conflicting
influences.
On the negative side, the dollar been buffeted by a US economy that only
recently appeared to be foundering in its attempts to pull away from
recession, by declining domestic interest rates pressured lower by Federal
Reserve policy eases, and by early and disturbing signs of President Bush's
political vulnerability in election year.
On the positive side, there has been rising interest rates in a Germany
troubled by inflationary pressures and the complex economic and political
repercussions of reunification, political turmoil and an apparently
collapsing economy in the republics of the former Soviet Union, and economic
slowdown and financial crises in Tokyo where stock values have plummeted,
institutions have curtailed foreign investments and the seemingly
all-powerful growth machine has begun to stall.
Against this unsettling background, the dollar has charted an upward path.
Since January it has appreciated 4 per cent against both the D-Mark and the
yen, and 1.5 per cent against sterling.
The view of analysts in New York is to expect a modest appreciation in the
dollar over the rest of the year. The main reason for their bullishness is
the US economy, which is forecast to grow at a steady rate of between 2.5
per cent and 3 per cent over the next eight months. In contrast, growth in
the main European economies will be slower, while there are enough doubts
about the outlook for the Japanese economy to also swing the forecasts in
the dollar's favour.
On the policy front, US interest rates look as though they have bottomed,
while the more sluggish European economies could require some extra
stimulus. This means yield differentials between the dollar and the D-Mark -
which recently reached historic highs - should finally begin to narrow.
There are two threats to this scenario. The Federal Reserve could cut rates
once more if it thinks economic growth is not sufficiently robust. The
likely trigger would be fresh news of weakness in the jobs market. The other
danger is if the Bundesbank proves more hawkish about inflation. If
industrial unrest forces employers to grant big pay increases, then the
Bundesbank could keep policy tight.
The near-term direction of Japanese monetary policy is harder to call. The
conventional view is that slowing economic growth and continued financial
instability will persuade the Japanese authorities to adopt a more
accommodating monetary stance.
However, there is an alternative prospect. This is that the policy remains
unchanged, or even tightens, as the Japanese government bows to
international pressure to reduce its bulging trade surplus by forcing the
yen higher.
Moreover, the signs are that Japanese fiscal, not monetary, policy will be
eased in the immediate future, which could boost confidence in the economy
and turn the slide in the growth rate. Add to that further declines in net
outflows of Japanese capital (linked to stockmarket losses), and it is
plausible that the yen will actually gain against the dollar.
A big unknown on the horizon this year is US politics. A Bush victory in the
November election, guaranteeing continuity of political and economic policy,
would be the best possible outcome for the dollar.
(This assumes, of course, that the nation and the financial markets do not
fall for the charms of Texan billionaire and can-do businessman/politician
Ross Perot, who is preparing to run as an independent.)
Analysts have warned, however, not to expect a celebratory post-election
surge in the dollar if Bush wins. All the currency risk, therefore, is
stacked the other way, with the potential for the dollar to take a big hit
at a hint of trouble in the Bush campaign.
Yet the chances of a Democrat (or an independent) winning the presidency
remain slim, in spite of those early hiccups in Bush's re-election drive. In
his favour, Bush has an opposition still divided over the electability of
its likely presidential candidate, Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas, and an
economy that is showing signs of achieving a sustainable recovery at exactly
the right time.
The election, however, is far enough away for the markets to ignore it for
now. 'I'm not sure electoral expectations are factored into the dollar yet,'
says John Lipsky, economist at Salomon Brothers in New York. 'It could be a
bit like it was in the UK election, where the markets did not take it
seriously until just before polling day.'
Thus, barring any disasters felling Bush, the dollar should be free from
electoral considerations between now and early autumn.
International politics could also leave its mark on the dollar this year.
The unstable situation in the Commonwealth of Independent States, has
already given a short-term lift to the US currency, which is traditionally
the safe haven for investors concerned by global political unrest.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (3): Stability amid turmoil - Yen
shrugs off changes in the Japanese economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOMESTIC financial and political turmoil and far-reaching global political
change have left the yen remarkably unscathed over the past year.
In the fiscal year 1991, the dollar averaged Y133, with the currency moving
in a range of Y15, the second smallest fluctuation since it floated against
the dollar in 1973. The currency has shrugged off significant changes
affecting the Japanese economy such as long-bond yields falling from last
year's 9 per cent to the recent 5.2 per cent, and the stock market down more
than 55 per cent from its peak. The stock market scandals and political
bribery allegations that shook Japan last year failed to rock the yen.
The authorities have shown that they are able to stabilise currency markets.
Earlier this year, the Bank of Japan and Federal Reserve Bank of New York
were selling dollars in co-ordinated intervention. According to Mr Paul
Summerville, economist at Jardine Flemings in Tokyo, increased information
has also decreased currency fluctuation. 'Dollar/yen movements are becoming
limited because information is discounted into the rate every day,' he says.
However, the middle- and long-term trend in supply and demand points to a
strengthening of the yen. Japan's current account surplus for the fiscal
year to March 1991 surged by 167 per cent from the previous year to Dollars
90bn. Official figures disclosed a record surplus of Dollars 113bn in the
trade account, and a surplus of Dollars 40bn in the long-term capital
account, the first surplus since 1980.
The long-term capital account surplus followed a sharp increase to Dollars
101bn in foreign net purchases of Japanese securities from Dollars 60bn.
Foreigners bought a net Dollars 36.77bn in Japanese stocks, up from Dollars
15.92bn in fiscal 1990.
Japanese investment in overseas markets has started to shrink, as excess
liquidity has been squeezed out, and overseas and domestic interest rate
differentials have narrowed. In 1991, Japanese direct investment was Dollars
23.6bn, down from Dollars 44.9bn, reflecting tougher financial conditions at
home and the world recession.
Long-term capital flows are expected to remain in surplus for Japan as
Japanese investors continue to favour domestic investments and foreigners
remain net buyers of Japanese equities, prompting Mr Robert Feldman, an
economist at Salomon Brothers in Tokyo, to forecast that the yen will
strengthen to Y115 against the dollar.
In addition to payments surpluses, Mr Masao Susaki, head of research at the
Bank of Tokyo, says that dollar/yen forward contracts affect the currency
rate.
'Japanese exporters and speculators made positions in dollar selling forward
contracts in the late 80s and have been rolling the positions over,' says Mr
Susaki.
He says investors and exporters will start selling the dollar against the
yen from mid-1992. Mr Susaki expects the average dollar/yen rate to be
around Y123 this fiscal year.
Mr Hideki Furuya, senior economist at Sanwa Research Institute, says that
economic fundamentals dominate the yen currency movements, and political and
financial scandals tend to be secondary factors in the long run.
Mr Furuya says that while the yen has weakened on the back of a slowing
Japanese economy, recent economic figures indicate a gradual recovery. After
declines in industrial production, inventory growth has slowed to a 7 per
cent increase in March, down from a peak 13 per cent in December.
Housing demand is showing signs of a recovery, reflecting the fall in
interest rates on housing loans. The economy is also expected to benefit
from the government's stimulatory package, which brings forward 75 per cent
of this fiscal year's public works spending into the first half. According
to Mr Furuya, this will have the same impact as an increase of Y3,000bn in
spending.
Reflecting the gradual recovery of the economy and a rise in long-term
interest rates towards the end of the year, Mr Furuya forecasts the yen will
rise to Y125.
Mr Summerville, at Jardine Fleming, sees the D-Mark/yen rate averaging
between Y70 and Y75 in fiscal year 1992.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (4): Shine starts to fade /
Investigating the D-Mark's decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Deutsche Mark has lost something of its shine in recent months. Since
the beginning of the year, what has traditionally been Europe's strongest
and most stable currency has lost ground against the US dollar, against
sterling, and and against other currencies in the European Monetary System.
The slippage in the currency's value since the beginning of the year - from
DM1.53 to nearly DM1.61 against the US dollar by the middle of May, from
DM2.85 to DM2.93 against sterling over the same period - indicates a
significant deterioration of sentiment. Whether this reassessment is the
prelude to a more radical shift in perceptions remains to be seen.
Many commentators take the view that the Bundesbank, arch-defender of
monetary stability, has taken the right decisions and is undergoing problems
amid the turbulence of this year's wage round. According to these analysts,
the Bundesbank's determination to fight the battle against inflation is
undiminished - and, more importantly, its credibility is intact.
However, there is a minority view that the Bundesbank's determination to do
battle with inflation has already faltered - but that the market has not yet
cottoned on to this. According to this line of argument, when market
perceptions catch up with the new and unfortunate reality, there will be a
new and more permanent downgrading of the value of the D-Mark.
The stark facts of the matter are that year-on-year inflation in Germany
reached 4.8 per cent in March - more than twice the Bundesbank's target of 2
per cent. Money supply M3 - the broad measure which is a key indicator for
the Bundesbank's monetary policy - grew at an annual rate of 9.75 per cent
in the same month, again way above the Bundesbank's target range of 3.5 to
5.5 per cent.
Has the Bundesbank done enough to counter these trends? Or, is it succumbing
to international pressure and letting itself be bullied into keeping rates
too low for Germany's domestic situation?
The Bundesbank moved last December, raising Lombard and Discount rates by a
half a per cent. At the time, the rise to 9.75 and 8 per cent (Lombard and
Discount rates respectively) took investors by surprise. Economists expected
at the most a rise of 25 basis points. The move to Germany's highest
post-war interest rates was taken as evidence of the central bank's
unwavering commitment to the goal of price stability.
Reflecting the markets' confidence, Bund prices surged, with yields on
10-year long Bunds tumbling from well over 8 per cent to 7.75 per cent and
lower. The psychology behind this paradoxical rise in bond prices in
response to a rise in interest rates was due to investors' conviction that
the Bundesbank had knocked inflation on its head once and for good. The rise
would encourage the unions to behave responsibly in the forthcoming wage
round and allow the Bundesbank to chop headline rates again by the third
quarter.
As events unfurled, this prognosis began to look optimistic. Unions - first
the steel workers and then the public sector workers - showed themselves
unwilling to defuse inflationary pressures by accepting pay increases below
the level of real inflation. The powerful IG Metall union was also in
sabre-rattling mood, and, like the public sector, settled for a basic 5.4
per cent.
The consensus date for the lowering of rates crept backwards by the week -
from late in the third quarter to the fourth quarter. From today's
viewpoint, even the first quarter of next year looks extremely optimistic.
Perhaps interest rates might have to go up again first.
The Bundesbank has so far maintained its credibility, a fact reflected in a
steeply inverted yield curve. Interest rates at the long end of the market
are sharply lower than short-term rates, 150 basis points apart in fact,
because the markets still believe the Bundesbank will win. And some argue
that the Bundesbank has been right not to overreact to money supply figures
which to a large extent reflect non-inflationary rebuild of eastern Germany.
However, argues Avinash Persaud at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew - under the headline
'Crumbling credibility?' - 'a number of new pressures may restrain the
Bundesbank from responding to the worrisome acceleration in monetary growth.
If these pressures are seen to influence the Bundesbank, market perception
could evolve'. From being perceived as Europe's most active central bank, it
could suddenly be seen as merely reactive, Mr Persaud argues, with dire
consequences.
Mr Persaud identifies three pressures on the Bundesbank policy-making, two
international and the other domestic in nature. First, Germany's economy is
slowing down, and may slip into recession - may the Bundesbank not be
tempted to ease rates to stimulate growth? Second, the US has cut its own
interest rates aggressively to kick-start its own and by extension the world
economy - and it is attempting to bring pressure to bear on Germany to
follow suit. Third, there are specifically European pressures on Germany:
Germany's European partners are putting political pressure on the German
government to keep rates low.
As the former Bundesbank president, Mr Karl Otto Pohl, indicated in a
recently published book, Bonn rode roughshod over the Bundesbank in 1990,
forcing through better monetary union between the two Germanys at a much
more generous exchange rate than the central bank wanted. At a time when
Bonn does not want to rock the European boat, the Bundesbank may find itself
under intolerable political pressure once again - this time to keep interest
rates lower than required.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (5): Prognosis for pound is good
 -Sterling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STERLING LOOKS set to enjoy a period of relative stability on world currency
markets, amid a healthier outlook for the UK economy and the prospect of a
settled political environment.
Behind the reappraisal of the pound in recent weeks by many international
investors was the Conservatives' surprise win in the April 9 general
election. That removed the doubts of some market practitioners that sterling
could face a devaluation within the European exchange rate mechanism and
sparked an intense period of buying pressure.
The pound's consequent rise against the D-Mark - from DM2.83 early in April
to around DM2.94 a month afterwards - was the result of the strongest surge
of support sterling since the UK joined the ERM in October 1990.
Helping sterling has been the general sentiment that Britain is starting a
slow recovery from its serious recession. Such a conclusion has been
supported by several economic indicators in recent months, notably a
sizeable 3 per cent quarter-on-quarter increase in underlying import volumes
in the first three months of 1992.
There is also the perception that Britain - unlike other European nations
including France and Italy - faces a relatively long period without an
election. As a result, purchasing support for the pound relative to other
European currencies has been healthy.
Sterling has also benefited indirectly from the problems facing the German
economy as a result of unification. These appear to have weakened the role
of the D-Mark in the ERM and have strengthened other currencies in the
system.
It was partly because of the markets' perception that the role of the D-Mark
might have lost some of its importance that the pound weathered the
interest-rate cut on May 5.
The reduction brought UK base rates from 10.5 per cent to 10 per cent in the
first such fall since September. It narrowed the gap between UK rates and
the corresponding 9.75 per cent German Lombard rate to just a quarter of a
point, the lowest level since 1981.
For all the stronger tone of sterling, its rapid rise in the month after the
election should be regarded in the context of the poor period in the six
months before the poll.
During this time, investors sold sterling in large volumes because of
worries about a possible change of government and doubts about how long any
UK recovery could be sustained. For much of this period, the pound
languished as the ERM's weakest member.
Can sterling's recent strength be sustained? Much depends on further
progress in containing inflation. There are indications that inflationary
pressures - which have lain dormant for much of the past 18 months because
of the demand-limiting effects of the recession - may start to reappear over
the next few months. That could weaken the demand of overseas investors for
sterling and depress its value.
Another question mark is over the pace of UK recovery. Assuming that the
revival proceeds at a relatively sedate pace sterling's strength can be
expected to hold. But if indications emerge that the economy is being thrown
off bal-ance - such as through a surge in imports that would show up in a
deteriorating trade position - then the pound could suffer.
A third factor concerns the decision on whether to put sterling into the
narrow, 2.25 per cent band of the ERM. The pound is only one of three
currencies in the 10-currency system which are allowed to fluctuate against
all the others in broad, 6 per cent bands.
There has been speculation that the UK will enter the narrow band at its
existing central DM2.95 rate over the next six months - a decision which
would probably increase the attraction of sterling to international
investors.
A fourth issue is the direction of German interest rates. It is possible
that the Bundesbank could decide to push up German borrowing costs in a
further effort to dampen inflationary forces sparked by the surge in demand
in the formerly communist eastern part.
Even allowing for the reappraisal in many market practitioners' minds about
the D-Mark's role in the ERM, such a move by the Bundesbank would almost
certainly lead to a large switching of funds into the German currency,
putting pressure on sterling.
Finally, no one knows to what degree the role of the D-Mark in the ERM will
change in a permanent way. There have been some suggestions that the
D-Marks' central position in the mechanism could be taken over at some point
by the French franc, on account of France's good inflation performance over
the past year.
To many economists such theories seem fanciful. Until the Bundesbank is
replaced as Europe's most hardline central bank on inflation, then it
appears Germany's role will remain dominant.
On this thinking, it could well be that the UK has to get used to a more
fluid pattern of interest-rate changes as part of membership of the system.
Thus, even though Britain took the opportunity to cut rates in early May, if
the Bundesbank were to tighten policy over the next few months the UK might
have to raise them again to prevent sterling falling beneath its ERM floor.
Such a move would underline the degree to which ERM entry has pushed
responsibility over UK monetary policy away from London and towards the
members of the Bundesbank council sitting in Frankfurt.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Foreign Exchange (1):  Caught in the eye of a
storm - Leading currencies have been buffeted by world upheavals over the
past 18 months. A symptom of a recent uneasy calm has been a marked decline
in the volatility of the so-called G3 exchange rates - the dollar, D-Mark
and yen / Assessment of the future of currency markets in the light of
economic and political events
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S foreign exchange markets are caught in the eye of a storm.
Leading currencies are suspended between geo-political pressures for change
on the one hand and, on the other hand, institutional developments in the
global banking industry and moves to greater integration in western Europe
which argue for calm.
A symptom of this unstable equilibrium has been a marked decline this year
in the volatility of the so-called G3 exchange rates - the dollar, D-Mark
and yen.
The dollar's fluctuation range against the D-Mark in the first 4 1/2 months
of this year was just 18 pfennigs as it moved between a low of DM1.50 and a
high of DM1.68. This, according to Swiss Bank Corp, is less than half last
year's trading range of 39 pfennigs and well below the 105 pfennig trading
range recorded in 1985, when market conditions were especially turbulent.
The movement of the dollar against the yen has been even more subdued - a
mere 12 yen between a low of Y123 and a high of Y135, against fluctuation
ranges of Y19 last year, Y35 in 1990, Y51.5 in 1986 and Y63 in 1985.
The decline in exchange rate volatility has reflected a number of forces in
the world economy and banking industry since the mid-1980s.
Governments want more stable exchange rates. Although the Group of Seven
countries - the US, Japan, Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada - no
longer attempt to peg their exchange rates to each other as after the 1987
Louvre Accord, they act when necessary to combat excessive exchange rate
movements.
More important perhaps have been regional developments. In particular, the
exchange rate mechanism of the European Monetary System has increasingly
taken on the characteristics of a fixed exchange rate block. It has
attracted new members (Spain, Britain and Portugal over the past three
years) and acts as a centre of gravity for non-EC countries such as Sweden,
Norway and Finland which peg their currencies to the European currency unit
(Ecu) and are seeking closer links to the EMS. ERM rigidity has grown with
the adoption last December at the EC's Maastricht summit of plans to move to
Emu, or economic and monetary union, by the end of the decade.
All industrialised nations put a high priority on combatting inflation.
While there has been increased recognition that national economic policy
measures must vary to take account of differing conditions, convergence
towards low inflation has helped iron out one classic cause of exchange rate
movement.
Central banks have become more adept at managing intervention. They no
longer defend specific currency rates, preferring instead to carry out
smoothing operations in the exchange markets. These more refined tactics
have deprived speculators of the 'one-way bet' that so often appeared when
fixed or semi-fixed rates were defended, only to be abandoned under the
pressure of speculative forces.
These trends have been reinforced by developments in banking and among other
market participants.
In general, the currency markets have become more risk averse. Caution has
grown with the approach of the end-1992 deadline for international banks to
comply with stringent capital adequacy ratios, agreed in 1988. Loan losses
incurred during the past three years of slow growth and recession have
curbed banks' enthusiasm for speculative foreign exchange trading.
But it would be wrong to assume that calm will endure in the foreign
exchange markets. Following the collapse of communism and the end of the
Cold War, the currency markets, like policy makers, are operating in a world
where old certainties no longer hold good.
The strength of the US economic recovery is unclear, as is the capacity of
Germany to absorb the new eastern Lander without allowing inflation to run
out of control. There are doubts whether the authorities in Tokyo will be
able to stave off recession while managing the current problem of asset
price deflation in Japan. Overshadowing these worries, is the unfathomable
outlook for the republics of the former Soviet Union as they embark along
the road to the market economy.
Large-scale changes in exchange rate relationships may emerge once there are
answers to these uncertainties. When determining exchange rates, the market
has already begun to look much more closely at underlying economic and
political factors than simply at nominal interest rate differentials or the
trend lines drawn by chartists.
Such considerations lie behind the late spring reappraisal of sterling and
the French franc, which has allowed the authorities in London and Paris to
bring their official interest rates almost down to German levels.
The dollar's reaction to last December's interest rate changes in Germany
and the US, when Germany pushed its rates to their highest peace-time levels
since the 1930s and the US responded by cutting its discount rate to the
lowest level for nearly a generation, provided an early example of this
trend.
After an initial downwards move, the dollar responded to the yawning 6
percentage-point interest differential in favour of the D-Mark by moving
higher. Investors in this case looked beyond the immediate horizon and
reasoned that the news was good for the US economy. They also assumed
(wrongly as it happened) that the next move in dollar interest rates would
be upwards.
While fast-moving economic and political changes make smooth running
currency markets more important than ever, the general decline in exchange
rate volatility has been bad for profits.
These factors have reinforced a tendency for trading in the leading
currencies to become concentrated among a small number of big,
well-capitalised players such as Citibank and Chemical Bank of the US, Union
Bank of Switzerland and Barclays Bank of Britain.
Trading in leading currencies takes place in a mature market, where
information is very rapidly disseminated to all participants and competitive
edge is hard to achieve. A strong customer base has become all important,
not just for the business that it brings but for the insight it provides on
exchange rates movements. As capital flows have supplanted trade flows as
the engine of market activity, traders have had to develop more
sophisticated services such as options and derivatives to win business from
institutional clients.
In this very competitive environment it seems that London has continued to
build up its position as the world's leading foreign exchange centre, at the
expense of Tokyo, where Japanese banks have been hard hit by the asset price
fall, and New York, where a lack of liquidity, particularly on Fridays, has
forced some foreign exchange banks there to function as niche players.
But such concentration of muscle does not mean an absence of business
opportunities elsewhere. Markets for so-called exotic currencies, from
eastern Asia or Latin America, are becoming more prominent.
They offer opportunities for smaller trading companies to operate on their
own account and provide some of the excitement that used to characterise the
foreign exchange market as a whole in the 1970s and 1980s.
In a business that sometimes wonders whether it is in decline, trading in
second line currencies will continue to grow.
The historic currencies of western Europe may be destined to disappear if
plans for Emu are fulfilled. But other currencies will gain importance as
the ex-communist countries of eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union
embrace the market economy and move towards currency convertibility.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (11): Labour-dominated scene - Economic
successes for moderates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LABOUR Party was returned with ease as the largest party in the recent
local elections for the Coventry city council.
In April, Mr Dave Nellist, who was expelled last year from the Labour Party,
ran as an independent and this factor tended to dominate coverage of the
general election for Coventry.
These two developments may have created the impression that - seen from a
distance - Coventry was a little like Liverpool: an industrial,
predominantly working class city, faced with a struggle between the hard
left and Labour Party moderates.
In the event, Mr Dave Nellist, a popular local man who had built up a
reputation as a good constituency member of parliament, was defeated in
Coventry South East by the official Labour Party candidate, Mr Jim
Cunningham.
But it was a close-run thing - Mr Cunningham polled 11,902; Mr Nellist,
Independent Labour, 10,551; while Mrs Martine Hyams polled 10,591 for the
Conservatives - showing a seven per cent swing to the Tories from Labour
since the 1987 election.
At a local level, however, any faction-fighting within the Labour Party was
not a consideration. The Conservatives did gain five seats at the expense of
the Labour Party, but Labour still held an overwhelming 41 seats, with none
going to the Liberal Democrats.
Mr Bob Ainsworth, who won the Coventry North East seat for the Labour party
says: 'The hard left or extreme left - or whatever you would like to call it
 -has never had much influence at a local level.'
The Labour city council is widely seen as united and moderate council which
has been the main driving force behind the successful diversification of the
economy. Mr Jim Cunningham the new MP for Coventry South East, who was the
leader of the council until his election, says: 'We realised in 1981 we had
to change. We had to broaden the base from the car industry. The alternative
was mass unemployment. We built the science park with the university; we
took the initiative in building Westwood Park - Barclays Bank has moved to
Westwood. If Barclays bank is prepared to move to Coventry, then it must be
confident of the City's future.'
Mr Cunningham says there was little opposition from within the Labour Party
to these entrepreneurial policies - 'the only people to oppose us were the
Conservatives. The government didn't like the idea of local authorities
building science parks - they didn't like the idea of any public authority
spending money on that kind of thing.'
Mr Bob Ainsworth (Coventry North East) who is a former deputy leader of the
city council says: 'We were able to get things moving in the early 1980s
because - abnormally for a city council - we had a lot of assets.
'We owned most of the city centre and we had a lot of land. We were able to
use this land to enter into deals with developers. It's a lot more difficult
now, of course, because any land sales have to go mostly towards debt
relief.'
Asked whether the disturbances in the estate of Wood End in mid-May are not
worrying and harmful for the image of a city still trying to attract new
investment, Mr Cunningham says: 'Of course they are worrying - but it isn't
just Coventry, is it? All the talk I have been hearing in the House of
Commons is where is it going to be next.
'The basic problem in the inner cities is the young unemployed; many, in
their late 20s, and without jobs, feel disenfranchised and let down. It
isn't an ethnic problem, as has been suggested - the minorities are as badly
affected as everyone else.
'The trouble is there isn't enough training: anyone connected with the Tec
(Training and Enterprise Council) will tell you there are not enough funds.'
Mr Ainsworth, who made his maiden speech on the subject of the Coventry
disturbances, says: 'This kind of thing is going to happen until we have a
proper urban policy. Unemployment in these estates is so very high and many
people are unemployed for so long that it's socially acceptable not to work.
These people are without a stake in society.'
He continues: 'The tabloid press has exaggerated the disturbances - the
police never lost control of the estate. There were not great numbers
involved.
'The damage to property was not extensive. But yes, if the exaggeration is
believed, then it could harm Coventry's attempts to attract new companies.'
Mr John Butcher, a former government minister, the MP for Coventry South
West and the only Conservative among Coventry's four MPs, agrees that the
Labour-dominated council has done a good job in diversifying the economy: 'I
would say that there has been a healthy partnership between the local
authority, the educational bodies and the government.
'Now, of course, development of science parks and industrial estates will be
more and more in the hands of the private sector.'
In regard to disturbances Mr Butcher says: 'It has nothing to do with race,
as has been suggested. The problem here is a few young people, known to the
police, who decided to go on the rampage. The police have the situation
under control.
'The encouraging thing is that older people on the estate want to see the
young offenders dealt with. It is wrong to conclude from these events that
Coventry has a law and order problem.'

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (12): A big effort to strengthen the
China connection - Delegation due in Jun / The flow of goods and funds is
growing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COVENTRY has a gradually strengthening connection with China, evident in
both the vehicle and leisure industries, with the flow of funds, goods and
ideas moving in both directions.
As far back as 1983, the City Council wanted to take advantage of what at
that time was seen as China's 'open door' policy and, characteristically of
a city very attached to the idea of twinning, linked-up with Jinan in
Shandong province. That move came to very little and any hope that it might
do so were shattered by the events of Tiannamen Square. But now the
political atmosphere is changing.
MGA Developments, the design and engineering company, has, purely on its own
initiative, taken advantage of that. It has just completed in 27 months -
against an industry norm of three or four years - a Pounds 7.69m contract to
design and bring to production in China a 1.5 tonne truck for Tianjin
Automotive Corporation.
Production of the truck has started at the rate of 12,000 units a year. This
will rise to 50,000 and over the life of the project, total production is
expected to reach 500,000 units.
Meanwhile MGA is seeking to win more contracts in China. It has completed a
commission for the design of a four-wheeled drive vehicle and is negotiating
for a further contract to bring it to production.
It is also investigating another truck project. In the other direction,
there is the strong possibility that Chinese funds will be invested in the
council's project to bring the historic but deteriorating Coombe Abbey back
to life.
Coombe Abbey and the surrounding land is owned by the council but is just
outside the city boundary.
The Abbey is in need of repair and in its present state it has little
practical use, but it is a pivotal part of a wider project which will see it
restored as one of the focal points of a leisure project which will include
a country hotel, a golf course with club facilities and a health centre. The
council has gone into partnership with Lumley Castle, the Durham hotel
company, but needs further equity funds.
Now, China Construction International, a company which acts commercially but
whose activities are ultimately controlled by the government, has expressed
interest in providing Pounds 3m of equity for the Pounds 20m project.
The matter may be settled next month when a delegation is expected. For the
moment the council's dealings are through Trade Circle International, China
Construction's agents in London. An investment of Pounds 3m could mean that
China Construction would end up as the majority equity holder.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (8): Car maker's links go back over 50
years - Jaguar's long tradition in Coventry / In the late 1980s, Jaguar was
producing 50,000 luxury cars a year in Coventry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR'S connections with Coventry go back a long time, almost to the
origins of the motor industry, but question marks have recently hovered over
whether the company will maintain its commitment to the city.
Jaguar moved to Coventry from Blackpool in 1928. Under Sir William Lyons and
his successors, it has survived with various partners and owners in Coventry
for more than 50 years.
The takeover in 1989 by the Ford group for Pounds 1.6bn and the impact on
luxury car sales of the recession in the late 1980s has, however, made some
employees question whether the company has a future as an independent
marque, and what role if any Coventry would play.
The company was hit particularly badly by the downturn in sales for its cars
in the US. Exports account for something like two-thirds of sales.
In the late 1980s, Jaguar was producing 50,000 luxury cars a year in
Coventry, but last year output was only half that level and the company
registered a loss of Pounds 226m in 1991.
The battering that Jaguar took from the recession has led to a reduction in
the total workforce from more than 10,000 in 1990 to 8,000 today. The
numbers employed in the two manufacturing plants in Coventry has dropped to
under 7,000.
Reports at the time of the takeover that Ford executives were unhappy with
low productivity at Jaguar has led to suggestions that production of engines
would be moved elsewhere, and that assembly might also be transferred to
other parts of the UK, or even to Europe, or, at the very least, that the
Coventry plants could expect further drastic redundancies.
Mr David Boole, the director of communications and public affairs for
Jaguar, is at pains to dispel these unsubstantiated reports.
'Despite the softness of the market at the moment, Ford is convinced that
there is a future market for luxury cars.
'The entry of Japanese manufacturers, Nissan and Toyota, have proved that.
Ford are going to persevere with the Jaguar as an individual marque.
'Ford has has made a long-term commitment to Jaguar. It has said that it
will invest Pounds 1bn in Jaguar. It is going to expand the product range,
bring in new models, maintain the quality of Jaguars and improve
efficiency.'
One development being mentioned is the production a V8 engine for a new
mid-series vehicle which would replace the XJ6 and compete with BMW. This
does not mean, however, that the company will just be making bigger versions
of Fords.
Mr Boole insists also that Jaguar's future is inextricably bound up up with
Coventry.
'Ford has made a firm commitment to remain in Coventry,' he says.
Although there could be further job losses through natural wastage or
increased automation, the numbers employed are not expected to decline
substantially below the current figure of 8,000, and could even rise if the
world economy improves.
Over the next few years, Ford is looking to increase the numbers of cars
produced to 150,000, tripling the peak output of two years ago.
'You are seeing the first smatterings of a recovery. Sales of Jaguars in
April were 16 per cent higher that for the same month a year ago, compared
with 9 per cent for the rest of the car market.
'Sales in the US were 2.5 per cent higher in April over the same month,' he
says.
But he does emphasise that despite the guarantees given, Ford will want to
see productivity increases.
Mr Boole feels that the Ford takeover will ultimately be seen as a good
development, both for the Jaguar and for Coventry.
'The company enjoyed a sales spurt in the mid-1980s, particularly in the
United States, but it was never really big enough to compete on a world
scale.
'With a parent company developing a new generation of sports cars and
saloons, and with enough 'muscle' to take full advantage of the market for
these new models, it will be able to compete,' he says.
'That can only be good news for Coventry. It is part of Jaguar's tradition
to be in this city.'

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (9): The roots go deep - Peugeot Talbot's
community involvement
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW MACLEOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FEW weeks ago, a small community group in the Stoke area of Coventry
needed access to a photocopying machine, to duplicate a newsletter. It
turned for help to an unexpected quarter.
In many areas the appeal would automatically have been made to the local
authority, or one of its agencies. In Stoke, however, as in many other parts
of the city, it is increasingly Peugeot Talbot, the French car manufacturer
 -the antecedents of which put down roots in the fabric of Coventry early
this century - where such requests are heard.
Roots - or Rootes - is the operative word, of course. Lord Rootes, as he
later became, was one of the men who helped found the city's wealth on the
motor car, and having prospered so much from the skills and hard work of the
local people, he resolved to put something back.
Perhaps the most public evidence of Rootes patronage in the city is the
widely-respected University of Warwick, which despite its name is well
within the city boundary, and which came into being thanks largely to the
family's influence.
Peugeot Talbot assumed the role of patron when it acquired the ailing UK
business of Chrysler, which had absorbed Rootes Group some years earlier. Mr
Dick Parham, the deputy managing director, concedes that the company's
charitable efforts were permitted to wane in the years following the
takeover, as the management wrestled with the more pressing problems of
survival.
Some four years ago there was a sea change in Peugeot Talbot's fortunes, and
it became obvious that the company was riding the crest of a wave. At about
the same time, Mr Geoffrey Whalen, the managing director, and his board
members looked again at the company's place in the community. Mr Parham
deliberately chooses small instances, like the offer to duplicate the
newsletter, to illustrate Peugeot's belief that there is more to community
involvement than cheque book charity - the glamorous and well-publicised
business of allocating large sums for heart-rending causes.
The story can be told in figures, of course - charitable giving last year of
Pounds 181,000, covenants to hospitals, schools and community associations,
lists of cars on long-term loan to deserving organisations. But the
statistics alone leave the true nature of Peugeot's commitment in shadow.
The whole issue is illuminated, and given character, by the people who work
for the company, and who, from the boardroom to the shop-floor, immerse
themselves in local affairs.
SHOP-FLOOR workers are actively encouraged to involve themselves in local
matters. The company, which already supplies four JPs to the local bench,
recently asked for more volunteers to allow their names to go forward.
Coventry's current lord mayor, Mr Dave Edwards, is an employee, as is the
next mayor of Nuneaton, Mr Tony Lloyd.
Among his many activities, Mr Whalen chairs the Coventry and Warwickshire
Training and Enterprise Council, and has ensured that Peugeot Talbot
personnel have been seconded to help with its work. Mr Parham is chairman of
ADEPT - the Agency Developing Enterprise Partnership and Trust - which arose
from the bishops' Faith in the City working party, and concentrates its work
on the less privileged areas of the city. He was also instrumental in
setting up the 'Spirit of Coventry' movement, which has now merged its
interests with the newer, and like-minded, 'Coventry Is Making It' campaign.
Other executives are engaged in similar work throughout the city - the
purchasing director lends his expertise to the Coventry health authority,
and the finance director serves as a governor at Hereward College, the
city's national further education establishment specifically for the
disabled.
Links with education - and a desire to see employees enrich their lives in
and out of the workplace - are strong at the company. The company sponsors
Coventry Polytechnic's business school, helping to strengthen links between
education and industry. It works closely with local schools and offers work
experience to 16-18 year-olds. The firm has built a partnership centre, with
an accent on foreign languages.
Sporting ties are strong. The company sponsors Coventry City, Coventry Rugby
Club, and Warwickshire Cricket Club - giving it a hand in the three most
popular spectator sports in the area. On a broader front, Peugeot last year
launched an assisted learning programme, allocating Pounds 250,000 for any
studies - vocational or otherwise - to which employees are attracted, in the
belief that anything which stimulates the learning habit will eventually
enhance a fast-changing shop floor where the ability to pick up new skills
quickly will be of crucial importance.
By co-incidence, French has so far proved to be the most popular course,
even for workers who do not need it for their jobs. But others have chosen
to earmark their cash from the scheme in the pursuit of HGV licences,
fork-lift truck skills - and even passing the standard driving test.
'We've made rapid progress over the past few years - but we've by no means
finished. We can now give a lead, and harness the desire in the workforce to
help in the community by having this effectively as part of the company's
ethos,' Mr Parham explains.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (7): The city's largest employer -
Coventry City Council has substantial property holdings
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
COVENTRY City Council has long tentacles. This is not just a matter of the
number of people it employs, or the extent of the services it provides. It
also has substantial property holdings, more and more of which are likely to
become the subject of joint venture developments with the private sector.
At the same time, the Council's position as the city's largest employer
suggests that it is a significant influence on the local labour market. It
is in a position to act as a role model for the private sector, through, for
example, the pursuit of active training policies and the practice of equal
opportunity. Whether such influence will be sustained during a period in
which increasing constraints are being placed on local government
expenditure remains to be seen.
Contrary to the national trend, the size of the Council's employment roll
has actually increased over the last two years, although it is now starting
to drift down. In 1990 the Council had, in the jargon, 12,982 full time
equivalent employees. The latest figure, said Mr John McGuigan, the
assistant chief executive, is about 14,000.
The numbers are up to 300 fewer than a year ago, but, said Mr McGuigan, 'the
progressive reduction has not been as dramatic as other authorities.' This
is largely because Council staff have won contracts for rubbish collection,
housing maintenance and sports and leisure facilities' management that had
been put out to tender. But the total will drop as, for instance, further
education passes away from local authority control and as spending cuts take
effect.
The spending cuts spring from the disparity between what the council wanted
to spend and what the government thought it ought to spend. The government's
standard spending assessment for Coventry for the 1992-93 fiscal year was
Pounds 234.9m, an increase of 5.6 per cent over 1991-92; it was prepared to
allow spending of Pounds 245.3m, but any spending over that second figure
would have resulted in poll tax capping.
The initial City Council spending proposal was Pounds 251.7m. It has thus
had to shave that by Pounds 6.4m to avoid capping and, effectively, the
imposition of a government budget on the city. It came through with Pounds
6.9m of cuts, after an anguished spending survey which put potential council
economies into three categories: those which are politically unacceptable,
those which the Council is unwilling to face but would have to, and those
which it would have thought about doing anyway.
The burden of the cuts fell on the education service - Pounds 5.38m -
followed by personnel and administration, accounting for Pounds 1.24m, and
transportation and highways, accounting for Pounds 1.14m.
The financial position of the Council would have been stronger had it not
lost Pounds 0.5m in property rents, because of the weakness of the property
market and because of the necessity to make provision for failures to
collect the poll tax.
In both these regards, Coventry is not in a markedly different position from
any other council in the UK. In fact, its position on poll tax collection
has been better than most.
Mr McGuigan estimated that about 10 per cent of the city's people had not
paid anything at all. This is a relatively small proportion, given the
political agitation about payment. There was, indeed, a local campaign waged
against poll tax waged by Mr Dave Nellist, the former Labour MP for Coventry
South East who fought the seat - vainly as it turned out - in the general
election as an Independent. The council budget for 1992-93 assumes a six per
cent non-payment rate.
The council, best described as 'pragmatic Labour,' has played the poll tax
issue quietly, as its label might suggest it would. Equally, it is adopting
a pragmatic approach to development, especially where its own landholdings
are concerned.
It has dropped a passive approach of simply responding to private sector
approaches which might be forthcoming on a particular piece of land, or on a
particular social scheme.
Instead, it has been identifying possibilities for development and making it
clear that it is prepared to talk with anybody who is prepared to envisage a
joint venture, the structure of which would have to meet certain broad
criteria. These include long term partnership, as opposed to short term
funding, and a readiness to meet council objectives as well as producing
private sector profits.
Cases in point include the search for a partner to run and develop Coventry
Airport, the rehabilitation of Coombe Abbey and the creation around it of
more leisure facilities (covered in an article on the China Connection; see
facing page), a scheme to generate power from waste incineration, the
enhancement of the area around Coventry Cathedral and the expansion of
business parks around the outside of the city.
Co-operation with the private sector is necessarily an integral part of
Coventry's 1992 City Challenge bid. It is competing with other local
authorities to win government funding of Pounds 37.5m, spread over five
years, to revive the inner city wards of St Michael's and Foleshill.
Within this bid there are three large schemes where private sector companies
will play the major role. British Gas and Carroll Business Parks plan to
reclaim the old Foleshill gas works for a new business park.
Courtaulds and Inner City Enterprises wish to turn a vacant headquarters
building into a centre for the clothing industry and a new enterprise
centre. Ideal Homes and Moorfield envisage new homes and offices on a
derelict part of the Coventry Canal Basin.
For the Council, over and above the question of developing links with the
private sector, the City Challenge bid is of fundamental importance. Its
success or failure could speed or retard plans for revival in the poorest
part of the city.
If the bid is successful there will be an injection of central government
funds. But if it fails there is likely to be less funding for the city from
the government's Urban Programme. This is because the funds allotted to City
Challenge by the government come out of existing budgets. So, more spending
on City Challenge means less spending elsewhere.

THE UNIVERSITY of Warwick, situated to the south-west of central Coventry
has played an important role in helping the city's economy to grow and
diversify.
With 2,800 employees at the university and a further 1,100 in the
neighbouring Science Park, it was ranked in 1990 as the ninth-largest
employer in Coventry and third largest in the public sector.
The university came into existence in the mid-1960s as one of the new,
so-called 'plate-glass' universities (as opposed to ancient and red-brick
universities.) It has 10,000 students enrolled on undergraduate,
postgraduate, post-experience and distance-learning courses.
The 34 academic departments offer a wide range of three and four-year
undergraduate courses in the sciences, social sciences and humanities; and
there are 1,300 postgraduates. The 2,000 undergraduate places on offer each
year attract a total of 20,000 applicants.
Around 8 per cent of those who graduated last summer from Warwick were still
without a job by the end of 1991, according to a recent newspaper poll of
unemployment among graduates from British universities. This compares with
the national average of one in 10.
Much interest in Warwick has centred not only upon academic achievement but
on links with local industry and the role the university has played in
developing the economy of Coventry and Warwickshire. As might be expected in
an area with long associations with the automotive industry, the university
is strong in engineering.
For example, through Professor Kumar Bhattacharyy's, manufacturing group in
engineering, the university has worked closely with the Rover Group in
training and research, as well as with other companies.
Through the advanced technology centre, which is part of the manufacturing
group partnership, Warwick co-operates with both Rover and Rolls-Royce
Motors in strategic research into automotive technology and new materials.
The Warwick Business school, an integral part of the university, maintains
close contacts with the local business community. The school's centre for
small and medium-sized enterprises produces a twice-yearly business survey
which contains important information for the local business community. The
school has important links with the Coventry and Warwickshire Training and
Enterprise Council.
One of the region's commercial success stories is the University of Warwick
Science Park. This was started in 1982 as a joint venture between the
university, Coventry city council, Warwickshire county council and the then
West Midlands county council.
Its success was a factor in persuading the city council to locate its
100-acre Westwood Business Park, just across the road from the university.
Today, the science park houses 65 companies, many in high technology fields.
Dr John Wood, the Industrial Development Officer, says: 'The science park is
a success in that there is a definite technology transfer. Approximately
half the companies are involved in joint projects or consultancy. Not all
science parks have achieved these links with universities, some have become
just industrial estates.'
Coventry Polytechnic, which next month should receive permission to become
Coventry University, has also developed close links with the city's business
community.
The annual turnover the polytechnic is now around Pounds 46m, an increase of
around 50 per cent in the past ten years. The revenue comes not just through
government funding but also from overseas students and various private
enterprises.
There are 12,000 students attending the campus which occupies 18 acres in
the city centre, next to the cathedral. There are 1,800 staff making the
polytechnic, like the University of Warwick, a main employer in the city.
There are close ties with local companies. Both Peugeot Talbot and Lucas
provide support for posts within the polytechnic and fund specially-tailored
courses.
The polytechnic's wholly-owned trading company, Coventry Polytechnic
Enterprises, is now in its third year of operation.
Mr Charles Leonard, the head of commercial development who runs the company,
estimates that it now accounts for around seven per cent of the
polytechnic's revenue.
Activities range from training to negotiating professional liability
contracts and consultancy.
One of the most publicised of the company's activities are its dealings with
the former Soviet Union. More than 400 former Soviet nationals have been on
training courses at Coventry. There is currently a group of Ukrainians at
the Coventry sponsored by Allied Lyons and another group sponsored by De
Beers.
The Polytechnic has had to find private sponsorship for these trainees
because the sponsoring countries no longer have the funds to send managers
to Coventry.
The Polytechnic has recently received Pounds 20,000 from the British Foreign
Office 'know-how fund' to help set up mobile food kiosks in Moscow. The Vaz
car plant (which makes Lada cars) has asked the polytechnic's help in
setting its first commercial bank.
The company is working on around 500 projects or contracts and is seeking
more.

OFFICIALS AT Coventry City Council realised they would have to diversify the
city's economy in the early 1980s. The recession of 1979-81 had been
traumatic for Coventry, with around 53,000 jobs lost by 1982, compared with
the mid-70s. Over this period, the dominant industries - car-making and
related engineering - cut back their activities.
In 1980, 46 per cent of the workforce was employed in manufacturing of some
kind, most of in the automotive industry: it became obvious too that many of
the jobs lost were not going to reappear when the economic cycle turned
favourable.
An economic development unit at the city council was formed in 1986, and
from 1987 different kinds of companies began to move to Coventry.
Equity and law Life Assurance Company had already moved some of its
operations to Coventry in 1974, but the company, had been very much a lone
beacon in the financial services sector. Coventry was seen as a
manufacturing city, with the necessary related services being carried out in
nearby Birmingham.
The absence of a white collar culture meant that very little B1
industrial/office space was available for high technology or financial
services companies. The situation began to change with the founding in 1982
of the University of Warwick Science Park, a 45-acre site owned by the
university and developed jointly by the university and the city council.
Today there are 65 companies, many of them high technology concerns,
employing more than 1,100 people on the park.
Another development, Westwood Business Park, was brought on stream in 1986.
This 100-acre site which is close to the science park provided the
breakthrough the city needed. Again, it was developed by the city council,
but this time in conjunction with private sector developers. It has proved
attractive to financial services companies: Barclays Bank, which now employs
850 people in Coventry, and RSA Examinations Board, which employs 130 people
are two well known service companies which have moved operations to the
park.
The city council estimates that, in all, 157 companies have moved part or
all of their operations to Coventry since 1987, creating 10,570 new jobs.
This has meant that the percentage employed in manufacturing has dropped to
35 per cent.
On the science park, some of the high-technology companies include Sun
Microsystems, Buehler International, Telemecanique and Olivetti.
Other companies which have relocated to Coventry include the National Grid
employing 800 people at a new headquarters building; Midland Bank, which has
established a regional data headquarters, and employs 250 people, the
Department of Transport which has a regional administration unit involved in
motorway widening, and which employs 130 people, and Mortgages plc, a
financial services group, which employs 158.
A successful diversification is thus clearly under way for a variety of
reasons. The city does qualify for some government assistance as an
intermediate development area, but it has not had new town or urban
development status, and has not received large government grants to prime
the pump for developers.
The cheap cost of Coventry has, however, been a factor. In the late 1980s
rents for offices were as low as Pounds 7 a sq ft compared with Pounds 15
for Birmingham. There was also an abundance of skilled labour following
redundancies at car plants. Mr Myles Mackie, the investment and policy
adviser at the city council, feels the accessibility of Coventry has also
been important. He says, 'I know every town looking for investment claims it
is the centre of England, but Coventry really is: we are the closest part of
the Midlands to London - it's only an hour and 20 minutes by train. We're
close to the motorways, but there is good internal access. The ring road
actually works and there is little congestion in the city centre, unlike big
cities, such as Birmingham.'
But also important has been the ability of the local authority to provide
the right kind of accommodation. The RSA Examination Board when it wanted to
move out of London in 1988 appointed agents to find a new site. They found
premises in Nottingham and Derby, but they were unsuitable because they were
on industrial estates next to companies manufacturing. The Board wanted a
clean business-like environment and the Westwood estate fitted the bill.
Costs have risen since the late 1980s, and B1 business premises would now
cost around Pounds 13 a sq ft., but this is still competitive with other
relocation towns such as Milton Keynes, Peterborough and even Telford; 12
other industrial estates apart from the science park and the Westwood
business park are open for business, representing several hundreds of acres
of B1 space.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (6): Schemes have matured - Youth and
adult training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEWART DALBY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Coventry and Warwickshire Training and Enterprise Council was set up in
September 1990. This was a difficult moment: it was a time when a key
Coventry employer, Jaguar, was making large numbers redundant.
The TEC has been able to take in some, but by no means all of the 1,000 or
so employees made jobless at Jaguar, under its Employment Training
programme.
The ET scheme, together with the Youth Training Scheme, is one of the two
major programmes which the Coventry and Warwickshire Tec like other Tecs has
inherited from the government's Training Agency.
The ET programme is designed for the older workers, who are thrown on to the
labour market in mid-life and who run the risk without retraining of
becoming long-term unemployed.
YTS was designed for young people between the ages of 16 and 19 with the aim
of giving them vocational qualifications.
The programme for former Jaguar workers is rather special in that Jaguar is
making facilities available for retraining and the Coventry Chamber of
Commerce is also involved along with the Coventry and Warwickshire Tec.
But the TEC has also had to absorb others made jobless in the recent
recession.
Mr Scott Glover, the chief executive of the Tec, says that there are around
3,000 people on the ET programme at any given time. He rejects suggestions
that the ET programme has just become an easy way for long-term unemployed
to pick up money with no real intention of taking a job.
'Seventy five per cent of thepeople we have interviewed, and this includes
employers as well as people on the scheme, have said they feel the scheme
has been very beneficial,' he says. He estimates that there is a successs
rate of 25 per cent of people on the scheme finding new work - 'this is not
high enough of course, but it is early days in the scheme and there has been
a fierce recession.'
Several millions of the budget of Pounds 25m is spent on adult training.
Around 56 per cent of the total goes on youth training which is the other
main programme inherited from the training agency.
The idea is that young people of between 16 and 19 are given funds with
which they can not support themselves exist but also buy some training -
either on-job training or at a college or a combination of both - which will
lead to a recognised national vocational qualification (NVA).
There was much criticism of the youth training scheme (YTS) when it was
administered by the Training Agency.
It was said that some employers 'just used young people as cheap labour' and
failed to give them training. Young people on the other hand saw the YTS as
a government ruse to deny them their social security money or unemployment
benefit, since acceptance of YTS money implied taking a job of some kind
whether it entailed training or not.
Mr Glover says: 'The schemes vary from area to area. But yes, I suppose in
the early days the YTS was designed to get young people off the streets. But
the schemes have matured. They are not known as the youth training schemes,
but just youth training. Our surveys show that 75 per cent of young people
involved in our programmes are receiving training of some kind which should
lead to a vocational qualification.'
The Coventry and Warwickshire Tec has not gone over to the voucher scheme
adopted by other Tecs. Under this system, the young person is given a
voucher or credit which can then be cashed in to buy training. Instead, the
Coventry Tec goes in for what Mr Glover calls 'flexible funding.' This means
giving the young person as much as possible to meet his or her training
needs.
'We must recognise it takes more to train an engineer than it does a
typist,' he says.
Funding remains a problem. There are 310,000 people in Coventry and 480,000
in wider Warwickshire. The Pounds 25m is only a fraction more than the
Training Agency was spending before the Tec was set up.
BESIDES the two training programmes the Tec has also taken over the
enterprise scheme and is responsible for small business.
The Tec wants to to do more than perpetuate old schemes.
The main thrust of its aims is closer targetting. By this is meant surveys
to find out what are the skills needs of the area and a closer involvement
with companies, local authorities, and educational authorities to try and
match those skills with the right kind of training.
One recent survey showed a need for, among other things:
Drivers for heavy goods, fork lift and public service vehicles.
In engineering - craft technicians and engineers.
Tourism, catering and hotel staff.
Management skills of all kinds.
All forms of electricians and electronic engineers.
All modern offices skills, eg computing and word processing.
This survey was taken at a time when unemployment was over 12 per cent in
Coventry although much lower in Warwickshire as a whole. It showed a
considerable skills mismatch.
The economy of Coventry has changed over the past decade with a
diversification into high technology industries away from the dependence on
engineering in the automotive industry.
Nevertheless, the 200 largest companies still employ nearly 40 per cent of
the workforce.
It is expected that some of these companies will shed further labour and
that there will be a high proportion of men and women in their 50s needing
retraining. One scheme which the TEC is behind is to get big companies to
use their facilities to train people from smaller concerns or from business
start-ups.
'This all takes time. We are evolutionary, rather than revolutionary,' says
Mr Glover. He stresses though, that the Tec does not want to be a provider
of training itself but wants to be an enabler or facilitator. This means the
main aim is to get local companies and education bodies involved - and keep
them involved.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (4): The shake-out takes its toll -
Manufacturing, the quality as well as the quantity of jobs on offer has
decline / The decline of the manufacturing sector and the rise of the
services sector leads to a mismatch of local skills

ONCE upon a time, when the sun shone on the Coventry economy and never
looked likely to set, city unemployment was about half of one per cent. That
was in 1955. Now, nearly a generation of change later, the contrast is
savage.
Over the last six months, said the West Midlands Enterprise Board in latest
analysis of unemployment in the old West Midlands metropolitan county, 'the
highest rate of increase has been in Coventry where the jobless total has
risen by 13 per cent, and the lowest has been in Birmingham where there has
been a rise of 6.1 per cent. In the county as a whole, there has been a fall
of 0.1 per cent over the last month and a rise of 8.5 per cent over the last
six months.'
Coventry, in other words, has been faring worse in employment terms than
other parts of the West Midlands conurbation. However, within this
generalisation, encapsulated in an overall unemployment rate of 14.1 per
cent against a national average of 9.4 per cent, there are distinct local
and sectoral variations.
Firstly, men have suffered from redundancies to a greater extent than women.
This is not a phenomenon peculiar to Coventry, but as the City Council noted
last year, men were losing their jobs at twice the rate of women, confirming
that 'the current recession is affecting mostly male full-time employment.'
The latest jobless totals have a male unemployment rate of 18.1 per cent and
a female rate of 8.0 per cent.
Secondly, and this follows on from the first point, redundancies appear to
have been taking place at a much higher rate in the manufacturing sector,
where there is the highest incidence of full time male employment, than in
the services sector, where there is a high level of female, part-time
employment.
The list of companies which have announced redundancies in recent months is
full of household names: Alvis, British Coal, closing the last pit in the
area; Courtaulds, Dunlop Aviation, Federal Express, GPT, Massey Ferguson,
Matrix Churchill and so on.
Third, the geographic distribution of unemployment in the city shows that
some wards are markedly more affected than others - 'there is still a strong
north-west/south-east divide,' observes the City Council, 'with much lower
rates evident in the areas to the south and east of the city centre and very
high rates within the inner city wards.'
The worst affected wards are St Michael's and Foleshill, where male jobless
rates run at 34.0 and 29.0 per cent respectively. They are also the wards
where there is the highest concentration of ethnic minorities  - Asian and
Afro-Caribbean. Their male unemployment rate is twice as high as the white
rate, and their female rate is three times higher than the white.
It is these wards where, says Mr Trevor Cornfoot, head of economic
development at the City Council, 'there is a real difficulty of trying to
secure adequate employment.' Partly, he notes, this is because the wards are
among the early industrialised areas of Coventry and over the last two
decades there has been a succession of large factory closures, including
Alfred Herbert, the machine tool manufacturer, and Morris Engines. Not
surprisingly, the two wards are the setting of Coventry's City Challenge bid
for new government urban renewal funding.
The steady rise in unemployment, as the recession has bitten deeper, has
taken place against the background of a decline in the working population,
itself a movement in parallel with a declining population. Official
estimates show that the total population is expected to decline to 296,000
by next year from 326,000 in 1979, while the working population will reduce
to 177,000 by next year from 193,000 in 1979.
But within these declining numbers there has been a perceptible shift in the
nature of employment. The string of manufacturing redundancies of recent
months has simply exacerbated a trend which has been apparent in varying
degrees from the early 1970s: the lower importance of manufacturing and the
higher importance of services in the employment mix. The 1989 employment
census, coming after a decade of deep cuts in capacity, still showed,
however, that 40 per cent of the workforce was employed in manufacturing,
against a national average of 23 per cent.
The present recession will have reduced that proportion further. Indeed,
most local predictions suggest that unemployment will continue rising at
least until well into the second half of this year and possibly into 1993.
Given the cyclical nature of the engineering industry, broadly defined, the
process of reducing dependence on manufacturing may provide a greater degree
of employment stability. But there are two problems.
The first is that, as a generalisation, jobs with wage rates which
traditionally had supported a family have disappeared to be replaced by
service sector jobs which offer less money. Labour surveys have shown that
the likely maximum wage for office staff is about the median level for
industrial earnings. They have also shown that, although basic pay for
full-time working women is roughly two-thirds of the level of male pay, it
is double the level paid to part time working women.
The second problem is that the decline of the manufacturing sector and the
rise of the services sector gives rise to a mismatch of skills. Service
sector employers do not need people with expertise in industrial working.
Given continued expansion of the Coventry services sector, finding new
entrants to the labour force will assume a greater importance even as jobs
are being lost.
The pattern for employment trends has been set. Dr Michael Healey, principal
lecturer in geography at Coventry Polytechnic, believes that, in terms of
job creation in the city, three factors are likely to be evident over the
coming years: there will be more part-time working, more flexible employment
practices and, as the present jobless statistics have foreshadowed, there
will be an even greater role for women.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (2): A changing economic base -
Manufacturing employment is concentrated in a small number of large
companies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SAFEWAY has a new supermarket on one of the western approaches to Coventry
city centre. Nearby, a bridge with the name Alvis painted on it, spans the
road. It is a natural historic juxtaposition, symbolic of changes in the
city's economy, writes Paul Cheeseright.
Alvis, the fighting vehicle manufacturer, owned the land where Safeway now
operates, but it has slimmed down and moved out of the city centre: where
once there was industry, there are services, a switch which is the single
most important characteristic of the Coventry economy since the recession of
the early 1980s.
Retrospectively, it is clear that manufacturing peaked in 1966, but the
critical years were between 1974 and 1982. 'During that period, Coventry
lost 46 per cent of its manufacturing jobs - 53,000. A major shift took
place in the local economy,' says Mr Michael Healey, principal lecturer in
geography at Coventry Polytechnic and the author of numerous studies on
Coventry's economic development.
His research showed that nearly two thirds of the manufacturing job losses
were caused by recession and changes in the industrial structure  -
'Coventry suffered from the weakness of the national economy,' Mr Healey
noted. Yet, despite the relative decline of manufacturing, the economic
significance of industry remains huge, and the 1990s recession may also lead
to permanent losses of capacity.
Indeed, there are local fears - and Coventry is not unique in this respect -
that the scale of the cutbacks, the reduced level of training, and financial
difficulties in coping with any expansion in demand will mean that companies
may not be able to respond quickly to an upturn in orders.
Certainly skill shortages are expected to recur. This may be unduly
pessimistic if only because the manufacturing base is held together now, as
it was 20 years ago, by a relatively small number of companies. The 100
largest employers account for around 60 per cent of total employment in the
city and within that 100, the top 15 account for around 45 per cent. These
are not the sort of companies that necessarily have trouble with the bank
manager.
The three largest private sector employers are Jaguar, GPT and Peugeot
Talbot, but the largest employer of all is Coventry City Council.
Employment is highly concentrated, and in manufacturing is spread over a
narrow range of sectors, primarily metal goods and engineering, with a
particular emphasis on vehicle manufacture: the historic industrial base
remains intact.
WITH more than half of its jobs in manufacturing now in the control of
companies headquartered outside the region, and frequently abroad, the
Coventry economy has, however, been prey to global economic movement. There
has not until recently been the leavening and diversity provided by local
small companies. Nor indeed has there been the stability which comes from
such diversity.
But the shockwaves of the 1980s recession, the easy credit of the mid-1980s
and a changing appreciation insouth-east England of Coventry's role in the
national economy has set off change. Reli ance on a small range of
manufacturers and a narrow range of products is diminishing.
On the basis of information gleaned from VAT registrations, Coventry had,
during the 1980s, an exceptionally high rate of business formation. There
was a growth rate of 41 per cent. This was not only the highest of any
district in the West Midlands but 12 percentage points greater than the
national average.
Surveys suggest both that the vast majority of the new businesses have been
of local origin and in the services sector.
The services sector has been expanded by inward investment. At a time when
the south-east England economy was growing quickly, Coventry was seen as
close enough to be convenient, and cheap enough to be attractive.
Indeed, reports Mr Harvey Williams, regional spokesman for the Royal
Institution of Chartered Surveyors, current office rents in and around
Coventry for new or recently refurbished property are between Pounds 12 and
Pounds 14 a square foot, compared with Pounds 17-18 in Birmingham and Pounds
40 in the south-east.
Yet, Coventry's significance as an office centre should not be overstated -
'a large proportion of service functions have been back-office functions.
'I don't think we would see ourselves as in the position of Birmingham,
saying we want to be some kind of financial services centre,' says Mr Trevor
Cornfoot, the City Council's head of economic development. Coventry is
instead becoming an office dormitory of the south-east.
Many of the new jobs have gone to business parks on the periphery of the
city, leaving the city council anxious to secure other forms of development
in the centre, through, for example, the expansion of hotel, leisure and
retail facilities.
Yet, come what may, Coventry's future, like that of the West Midlands as a
whole, is indissolubly linked to that of the engineering industry. The
problem has been to secure the growth of companies which will at once
diminish economic dependence on the traditional employers, widen the
industrial base and provide the development opportunities for the technology
of the next generation.
The city council calculates that there are now 300 companies in Coventry
engaged in high technology activities.
One stimulus has been the University of Warwick Science Park, a centre of
research and development for 54 companies of diverse origin - 'the science
park has made a difference to the quality of companies entering the city,'
notes Mr Cornfoot.
In spite of all these changes, Coventry has not managed to compensate, at
least in employment terms, for the de-industrialisation which took place
during the late 1970s and the early 1980s.
Although greater diversity carries the promise of greater stability, it is
not clear, especially after taking into account the effects of the current
recession, that the local economy has reached the stage where a new
generation of growth is assured.

FT  29 MAY 92 / Survey of Coventry (1): Diversification points the way to
greater stability - Although Coventry has large swathes of unused industrial
capacity, the city continues to seek an infusion of new economic vitality
from outside
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent

<TEXT>
COVENTRY is the epitome of the UK's industrial cities: a mix of wealth and
poverty, of pockets of grace in a suit of drabness, a dependence on the
industries which inspired its growth but an increasing reliance on recent
diversification, a population in overall decline, but including an enlarging
ethnic minority.
Smaller than Birmingham, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool or Manchester, Coventry
is, nonetheless, like them in that it has been badly served by the first
years of the decade. First the recession of the 1980s, a few brief years of
recovery, and then headlong into another recession which has stunted
aspiration.
There are now, it is true, glimpses of recovery. Since the beginning of the
year, most order books have stopped shrinking, but business surveys show
that not only in Coventry but in the West Midlands region as a whole, there
are large swathes of unused industrial capacity. The latest unemployment
figures, and the news that car production in April was still running at a
lower level than April 1991, show that the city is far from putting its
problems behind it.
Coventry is no longer 'car city' in the sense that it was in the 1960s and
1970s. In fact, its industrial base cracked in the 1980s recession. Its
fortunes, however, are still tied to the motor industry, and not only the
industry on a national scale. The success of the industry in carving out
export markets has only emphasised the way in which Coventry is borne along
on the waves of both the national and international economies.
Jaguar's problems in the US markets are a source of worry, and Peugeot
Talbot's growing share of the UK market a harbinger of future prosperity,
but both are controlled from outside the region.
Although the proportion of jobs in the manufacturing sector, dominated by
engineering and particularly vehicle assembly, fell during the 1980s from 46
per cent to 34 per cent, and has continued to fall since, large industrial
employers still are the main influence on the labour market. But that
diminution in the importance of manufacturing is the key to the city's
economic future.
During the 1980s, Coventry started to change its spots. Creation of more
small businesses, the appearance of high technology research companies
around the edge of the city and a spate of inward investment were the start
of a move towards a more balanced economy.
Although headquarters offices were few and far between, Coventry won its
share of back-office operations and, in effect, latched on to the industrial
economy a new, but relatively low level, office economy.
This movement, in turn, has allowed Coventry to weather the present
recession in better shape than, otherwise, it might have done. Indeed, the
major job losses of the last two years have not been in the services sector;
they have been in manufacturing.
It is an indication of the greater stability which springs from a larger
basket of economic activity that home repossessions in Coventry have been
running at 15 per cent below the national average.
IT is a moot point whether Coventry will again recapture the importance it
enjoyed as a manufacturing centre a generation ago, when the demand for its
products seemed everlasting and abundant. Building a new city economy is not
easy at the best of times, especially when there is a wider tendency of
decentralisation.
The drift from the country to the towns which started in the nineteenth
century has gone firmly into reverse. Coventry's population began to grow
sharply in the second half of that century and reached a peak of about
340,000 during the 1960s, the decade when manufacturing activity peaked.
Since the 1970s it has been drifting downwards: manufacturing does not
provide the work, the services sector has not fully made up the slack.
The outlook for Coventry then is not one of major expansion, but rather to
be a medium-sized city with, if the trends which became evident in the 1980s
hold firm, a relatively prosperous but varied economy.
There are both plus and minus signs. On the plus side is the re-invigoration
of the motor industry, Jaguar's problems notwithstanding. This has been
stimulated by the presence in the UK of Japanese carmakers and the gradual
introduction of Japanese practices to enhance productivity. It has been
emphasised by the increasing integration of British-based car makers and
component manufacturers into international motor trade.
But if the underlying factors needed to secure Coventry's continuing role in
the motor industry are in place, the growing number of small high technology
companies also offers the hope of industrial diversification into high
value-added products. This is the significance of, for example, the
University of Warwick science park.
At the same time, the geographical position of Coventry, the relative
cheapness of its property and land, should ensure that, once there are more
solid signs of national economic revival, there will be a steady trickle of
corporate refugees from south-east England. What happened in the 1980s
should happen again in the 1990s. The challenge will be to have available an
adequately trained labour force.
The minus signs include the perception that Coventry is not one of the most
attractive UK cities. The image of Coventry is of its inspiring cathedral
and the gentleness of some its immediate environs.
But a wider reality is the drabness of its 1960s architecture. While more
jobs may come from inward investment, the vigour of the city will not be
assured if the new arrivals want to live outside in the countryside.
The future vigour of the city is, of course, dependent on factors other than
that. Not least is the task of ensuring that its ethnic minority, largely
Asian in origin and now accounting for around 30 per cent of the population,
is not left out on a social and economic limb.
THERE is the need, too, to banish the industrial detritus of the past,
although, in this connection, Coventry does not have, like some of its
industrial city peers, huge tracts of derelict land.
These two sets of problems come together in the wards of St Michael's and
Foleshill. Here, the ethnic minority is concentrated and male unemployment
runs up to nearly 35 per cent. Housing in parts of the locality is the worst
in Coventry, the industrial infrastructure is decayed, and crime rates are
high.
Health levels are low relative to the rest of the city, but the funds to
make physical improvements, to train the lowly skilled and to provide jobs
are in short supply. The city council does not have them and that is why it
has made these two wards the subject of a bid for government funding through
City Challenge 1992.
But housing and unemployment problems spread to the estates in the outer
suburbs. Indeed, the events of mid-May, when police clashed with youths on
Wood End estate, one of the city's problem areas, were a blunt reminder of
the consequences when the cocktail of idle hands, recalcitrant minds and
warm weather is shaken too hard. For a city seeking inward investment, the
clashes were not the most obvious advertisement.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Philips to buy rest of Super
Club
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINORITY shareholders in Super Club, the loss-making Belgian video rental
chain, agreed yesterday to sell the company to its biggest shareholder, the
Philips electronics group of the Netherlands.
Philips, which holds 51 per cent of Super Club's shares, offered earlier
this month to pay BFr150 (Dollars 4.40) in cash for each of the 8.4m shares
which it does not already own. Shareholders were also offered the choice of
receiving warrants on Philips shares worth about BFr225 each.
A majority of 98 per cent of shareholders accepted Philips' terms at a
meeting of Super Club's holding company in Geneva.
The vote brings to an end a dispute between Philips and several key minority
shareholders about the value of Super Club's shares.
The Dutch company wanted 100 per cent control of the heavily loss-making
Belgian group to carry out a thorough restructuring programme.
At their peak in 1990, Super Club's unlisted shares were worth more than
BFr5,000 each on the Belgian over-the-counter market. The shares plummeted
after a swift expansion programme landed the company in debt. Philips took
majority control last year after a series of bail-out operations.
Philips' increasing involvement in the Belgian company had come as a
surprise because of Philips' own financial difficulties, but Philips
management has defended the investment, saying the video-rental business
complemented the company's production of VCRs.

R. J. REYNOLDS Tobacco International has started work on a Dollars 33m
cigarette factory in Piaseczno near Warsaw which is due to come on stream in
the middle of next year and have an annual production capacity of 8bn
cigarettes.
The decision to build the plant is in contrast to the strategy of its rival
Philip Morris which has offered to purchase the Krakow tobacco works which
accounts for around one third of the country's output.
Philip Morris, which recently bought the Czech cigarette monopoly, has a
long-standing link with Krakow where it has has produced its Marlboro brand
under licence since 1973. Last year output of Marlboro in Krakow reached 2bn
cigarettes and Philip Morris is offering to invest Dollars 200m in the plant
on top of the purchase price.
The country's five state owned plants last year produced 90bn cigarettes
while an estimated 10bn cigarettes are imported, many of them as contraband.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Manfred Worner, secretary-general of Nato, expressed optimism yesterday
that the alliance would resolve its row over the role of the new European
corps being set up by France and Germany.
His statement at the end of a two-day meeting of Nato defence ministers  -
not including France - came amid increasing signs of reluctance by other
European allies to commit themselves to joining the corps, as Bonn and Paris
have invited them to do.
'I have no doubt that in the end we will find sat-isfying solutions, not
only for France and the US but for all of the allies,' Mr Worner said.
Much would depend on the detailed arrangements for the new 35,000-man corps,
he added.
Several allies including the UK and the Netherlands, have voiced concern
that the Franco-German plan could undermine the transatlantic alliance.
Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, said Washington still had some
'unanswered questions about the new corps'. Foremost among these was how it
would fit in with the role allotted to the Western European Union as the
vehicle for developing Europe's defence interests.
Belgium is seen as one of the most likely candidates for an expansion of the
Franco-German initiative.
But Mr Leo Delacroix, its defence minister, said it would join only if the
corps were placed clearly under the political authority of the WEU.
The military units which Belgium is considering assigning to the corps would
be the same as it is earmarking for Nato's new rapid reaction forces.
Spain, which like France stands outside Nato's integrated military command,
remains interested in the Franco-German initiative, while Italy said it did
not intend to join the corps but would make other units available to the
WEU.

<TEXT>
LAST-MINUTE union protests have dogged talks - expected to end today -
between Fiat and the Polish government on the sale to the Italian motor
company of a majority share in the FSM car plant.
Union leaders at the Tychy plant, one of two in the FSM combine, were
continuing to insist yesterday on being consulted about the terms of the
agreement which Mr Giovanni Agnelli, Fiat's chairman, is expected to sign in
Warsaw today.
FSM at present produces Fiat's new Cinquecento model at Tychy as well as the
1970's Fiat 126 car at Bielsko Biala.
Government officials are due at FSM in southern Poland today to outline the
agreement to union representatives who are demanding there be no immediate
job losses as a result of the deal. Three unions - Solidarity, the OPZZ (the
old pro-Communist movement), and Solidarity 80 (a radical group) - are
co-ordinating their protest at Tychy, which employs 7,000 of the factory's
23,000 workers.
Tychy's unions are also demanding that the share of production costs devoted
to wages remain at the same level as in Fiat plants in Italy and elsewhere.
Under the deal, which was provisionally agreed last week, Fiat will invest
Dollars 2bn and will ultimately control 90 per cent of the company's equity.
It will be taking responsibility for FSM's outstanding foreign currency
debts worth Dollars 500m, as well as sums due to domestic suppliers worth
more than Dollars 200m. Fiat will add Dollars 180m into the company's
capital and will cover FSM's losses for the next four years. Fiat has also
promised to make new investments worth Dollars 850m.

reform, privatisation, the conversion of military industry, energy projects
and agro-business, writes Anthony Robinson, East Europe Editor.
Mr Jacques Attali, EBRD president, told a European Community-organised aid
conference in Lisbon last week that the bank was authorised to devote up to
40 per cent of its resources to projects in the former Soviet states and up
to Ecu4bn (Dollars 4.96bn) of its own funds to projects in Russia and the
other republics over the next three years.

FT  28 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie retreats to close below 2,700
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WORRIES about the prospect of more casualties in the commercial property
market, the lingering and depressing effect of Tuesday's poor trade figures,
and a clutch of cautious statements from company chairmen proved too much
for share prices on the London market.
Additionally weakened by the effects of a poorly performing Footsie future,
and falls for Wall Street and Tokyo overnight, the FT-SE Index fell early in
the session before staging a comeback towards the close, when Wall Street
began to improve in response to a firm showing by the dollar and US Treasury
bonds.
The Footsie ended the day 6.0 down at 2,698.6, the first time it has closed
below 2,700 since May 15, when international markets were rocked by news
that Olympia &amp; York, owner and developer of Canary Wharf, had sought
insolvency protection in Canada.
Share prices were given harsh treatment by marketmakers at the start of the
session, responding to a sharp decline in the June Footsie future, which
moved to a discount against fair value and prompted hefty selling of the
underlying stocks by index arbitrageurs. Selling pressure, however, was well
absorbed, in spite of the poor backdrop.
At its worst, only minutes after trading commenced, the Footsie was down
some 16 points. Thereafter, the index moved in a narrow range before
embarking on a good rally after Wall Street came in better than expected.
Dealers were heartened by a steep increase in the level of turnover, which
reached 639.5m shares, compared with Tuesday's 404.3m, translating into
customer business of only Pounds 879.3m, the lowest by value since the
general election.
The increased activity was attributed to a burst of programme trading, with
at least three trades being executed during the day. The biggest of these, a
mixed programme estimated by dealers to have been valued well in excess of
Pounds 100m, was said to have been operated around lunchtime by one of the
big UK integrated securities houses.
A number of specialists were satisfied at the market's performance, against
the underlying backdrop. 'I am very impressed at its resilience, given that
the futures' weakness would have put plenty of stock into the market; we
have come through in good shape,' said one. Others were not so convinced,
pointing to the disappointing building society lending statistics released
yesterday, which indicated that the economy remains depressed.
Institutions were said to have been looking hard at good quality defensive
stocks, such as food retailers. Oil shares continued to gain ground, led by
Lasmo, the Footsie's best individual performer. County NatWest carried out a
big placing of stock in United Friendly, the life assurer.
Mr Trevor Laugharne, equity strategist at Kleinwort Benson, adopted a
cautious line in the broking firm's latest UK Action Weekly: 'Without a
sizeable piece of news (bid, quality rights issue) to move it one way or the
other, the general lacklustre feeling could translate into very low volumes
and a gently falling trend over the next account.'

FT  28 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): April durables orders spark
brief Dow rally
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AFTER EARLY support from a stronger than expected April durable goods orders
report and demand for cyclical stocks, US share prices slipped back from
morning highs to leave just a minor improvement on the day, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average was finally 6.23 up at 3,370.44, having
been more than 15 points ahead at one stage. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500
gained a marginal 0.76 at 412.17, while the Nasdaq composite added 1.70 at
577.35. Turnover on the New York SE was a moderate 182m shares.
After Tuesday's decline, prompted by concern about the effect on the US
economic recovery of higher crude oil prices, yesterday's news of a 1.4 per
cent rise in April durable goods orders was a welcome surprise. Although the
headline figure disguised underlying weakness in non-transportation goods
orders, equity investors were cheered by the data, and there was
particularly strong early demand for cyclical stocks, which include
transportation issues. The buying soon petered out, however, and trading was
subdued for most of the afternoon.
Motor manufacturers were boosted by surprisingly strong mid-May car sales,
which surged to their highest level since late-December. General Motors rose
Dollars 1 to Dollars 39, Ford Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 44 1/8 and Chrysler
Dollars  1/8 to Dollars 17 7/8 , all in heavy trading.
Energy issues ran into some inevitable profit-taking as investors booked
some of Tuesday's gains. Exxon retreated Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 61 7/8 ,
Mobil Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 65 3/8 , British Petroleum ADRs Dollars 1 to
Dollars 59 5/8 , Occidental Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 22 3/8 and Texaco
Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 64 5/8 .
Control Data advanced Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 13 1/8 in turnover of about
1m shares after stating that it would divide into two separate companies
through a spin-off to shareholders.
Conner Peripherals dipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 22 on reports that top
executives and board members at the disk-drive manufacturer have been
selling large amounts of their stock in the company.
Syntex dropped Dollars 3 3/8 to Dollars 37 3/4 in active trading in the wake
of disappointing fiscal third quarter operating income of Dollars 127.5m,
little changed from a year earlier.
CML Group climbed Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 43 1/4 on news of third quarter
profits from continuing operations of 44 cents a share, more than double the
profits earned a year ago.
On the Nasdaq market, Corrections Corp plunged Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 5
3/4 after a newspaper reported that the Federal Bureau of Investigations is
looking into whether the company bribed officials to win prison contracts.
50-Off Stores lost Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 14 1/2 in turnover of 1.2m shares
as investors reacted coldly to first quarter earnings short of analysts'
forecasts.
Canada
TORONTO ended barely changed from the day's opening, although telephone
utility shares dipped and oil shares continued to climb.
Telephone issues fell on nervousness about an impending regulatory decision
on long distance telephone services.
The composite index was up only 0.6 at 3,382.9 and rises led falls by just
296 to 276 after volume of 27m shares.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Cost of funding high
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES IN the sterling money market moved slightly higher in a quiet day of
tight trading.
Once again the Bank of England forecast a big shortage that proved difficult
to take out, thereby keeping the cost of funding high. Eventually the
shortage was removed but only after late assistance from the Bank brought
overnight rates down.
The Bank's initial forecast liquidity shortage was Pounds 1.5bn. It set out
to be as accommodating as possible, purchasing Pounds 25m of band-3 bills at
9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 28m of band-4 bills at 9 19/32 per cent in the
early round.
In further morning operations it bought Pounds 125m of band-1 bills, Pounds
136m of band-2 bills, both at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 172m of band-3 bills at
9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 35m of band-4 bills at 9 19/32 per cent. It also
purchased Pounds 69m for resale to the market in equal amounts on June 16,
17 and 18 at a 9 15/16 per cent rate.
However, with the market reluctant to part with paper, the rate for
overnight money, which had started the day firm at 10 3/4 per cent, rose to
11 3/4 per cent.
In the afternoon the shortage was revised to Pounds 1.6bn and the Bank
operated again, buying Pounds 478m of bands 1,2,3 and 4 bills at the same
rates.
Only after the authorities had provided late assistance of Pounds 540m,
taking total official intervention operations for the day to Pounds 1.6bn,
did the cost of money cheapen significantly. Late borrowers were able to
pick up balances at 8 1/2 per cent, much lower than Tuesday's closing
overnight rate of 25 per cent.
Rates for one-month, three-month and six-month money crept upwards. The key
three-month interbank rate ended at 10 1/8 per cent after Tuesday's close of
10 1/16 per cent.
One trader said: 'The rate changes did not really reflect Bank of England
policy, it just reflected the fact that people were long on bills and not
particularly willing to sell them.'
There was little activity on the sterling futures market. The September
short sterling contract closed at 90.32, up four basis points on the day in
thin trading.
Overall, sentiment appeared to be suffering from Tuesday's disappointing
trade figures - the current account deficit widened to more than Pounds 1bn
 -and the growing awareness that chances of a further rate cut before the
early autumn are scarce.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar exploits D-Mark woes
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A STRONG dollar dominated active foreign exchange market trading yesterday
after a combination of favourable US economic news and higher crude oil
prices pushed it upwards through an important chart point of DM1.6250.
In London, the US currency advanced 2.55 pfennigs against a generally weaker
D-Mark to close at DM1.6345, while sterling dropped 2.7 cents to Dollars
1.8010. In New York, the dollar ended at DM1.6370 and the pound at Dollars
1.7948.
The German unit also lost ground to the Swiss franc and Japanese yen, and
weakened against the Portuguese escudo in the European exchange rate
mechanism in spite of repeated sales of escudos by the Bank of Portugal at
82.91 and 82.9 escudos to the D-Mark.
The dollar's rise was fuelled by strong buying on a growing belief that the
US economy is returning to reasonable growth. This perception has been
underpinned by bullish economic data, including news of a stronger than
expected rise in consumer confidence on Tuesday, favourable 10-day US car
sales figures, and improved retail sales and industrial production. These
factors encouraged expectations of an upward revision of first quarter gross
domestic product data being reported tomorrow.
News yesterday of a strong 1.4 per cent April rise in US durable goods
orders initially helped sentiment, even though closer inspection of the
figures revealed a very large defence component. The potentially
inflationary implications of higher oil prices also worked in the dollar's
favour as analysts reasoned that a further easing by the US Federal Reserve
was highly unlikely in the near term. The dollar's penetration of the
DM1.6250 chart level prompted covering of short positions and encouraged
some market operators to anticipate an early assault on the next chart point
of DM1.6450.
The D-Mark was beset by other woes. It lost ground to the French franc
following news that France's seasonally adjusted trade surplus jumped to a
record FFr7.79bn in April from FFr1.06bn the month before. It weakened
against the Swiss franc after Mr Markus Lusser, the Swiss National Bank
president, said he wanted to see the Swiss currency stronger to combat
inflation.
The yen rose against the D-Mark in a continuing technical reversal of the
latter's recent strength against the Japanese currency. The Bank of Portugal
intervened for the third straight day in D-Marks to stop the escudo bursting
through its upper fluctuation limit in the ERM against the Danish krone, the
weakest currency in the European Monetary System.
The pound was a minor beneficiary of the D-Mark's weakness. Although it fell
sharply against the dollar, it finished  1/4 pfennig higher in London at
DM2.9450 -  1/2 pfennig short of its central rate in the ERM.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Bigger silver deficit expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA DURR

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEMAND FOR silver has outstripped new supply for the past two years and 1992
promises a further widening of the gap, according to the World Silver Survey
1992, published by the Silver Institute, a producers' association. But the
disparity between supply and demand has failed to nudge prices upward
because of large stocks held by investors.
In 1991, total new supply of 495.1m troy ounces fell short by 46.2m ounces,
or about 9 per cent, of total demand of 541.3m ounces. This compares with a
shortfall of 37m ounces, or 7.3 per cent, between supply of 505.1m ounces
and total use of 542.1m ounces in 1990.
This year, a total supply is expected to be stagnant at 495.6m ounces while
demand rises to 548.6m ounces, resulting in an increased deficit of 53m
ounces, or 10.6 per cent.
Both mine and secondary (recycled) output fell last year. Mines produced
366.6m ounces, 1 per cent less than 1990. Mine production is expected to
increase just 1 per cent this year to 390m ounces. Recovery from secondary
sources dropped 5.8 per cent last year, to 111.2m ounces, and will fall
slightly to 111m ounces this year, the report says.
Supply last year was boosted somewhat by government sales and exports from
the former Soviet Union, Poland and other Eastern European countries. The
bulk of 12m ounces in government disposals was from the US.
Total silver fabrication demand fell marginally last year to 541.3m ounces
from 542.1m ounces, largely because of the Gulf War and recession in major
markets, the report said. A sharp decline in electronics and electrical
products use was offset by a rise in photographic demand. Overall 1992
demand is expected to climb as major economies recover.
So far this year, however, prices have stayed in a Dollars 3.90 to Dollars
4.40 range, about the same as in the latter half of last year, when prices
averaged Dollars 4.03 for the full 12 months. The price was down 16 per cent
in 1991 from the average of Dollars 4.82 in 1990 and has fallen steadily
since 1987, when it last broke Dollars 7 for the year.
Mr Jeffrey Christian, managing director of CPM Group, which prepared the
report, said that stocks held by investors - which he estimated at 1bn
ounces of mostly good market delivery metal - had held down prices and would
continue to do so. Reported market stocks stood at 313m ounces last year.
Mr Christian believes that, like the 1970s, the 1990s are shaping up as a
period of deficits in the silver trade. He does not, however, expect prices
to rise this year or even next year to a significant extent.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Treasuries buoyed by rise in durable goods
orders
</HEADLINE>

US Treasury securities rose across the board yesterday, recovering some of
the ground lost on Tuesday in the wake of higher oil prices.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  7/32 at 101
1/8 , yielding 7.895 per cent. At the short end of the market, the two-year
note was also firmer, up  3/16 at 99 3/4 , yielding 5.242 per cent.
The market was buoyed early on by news of a 1.4 per cent increase in durable
goods orders during April. Although the headline figure showed a bigger rise
than analysts had expected, new orders would have been slightly lower for
the month without a big rise in the volatile transportation orders
component.
Overall, analysts said the figures confirmed that the economic recovery
remained sluggish, and they briefly revived hopes that the Federal Reserve
may cut interest rates again.
The Danish bond market made strong gains yesterday after an opinion poll
showed a swing in favour of the Maastricht Treaty on European Union.
Hopes that Denmark would ratify the terms of the Maastricht Treaty, thereby
paving the way for the convergence of Danish yields, prompted international
investors to buy Danish paper.
Long-dated government bonds jumped a quarter of a percentage point, with the
9 per cent bond due 2000 rising from 101.00 to 101.25 to yield 8.76 per
cent.
Denmark holds its referendum on the Maastricht Treaty on Tuesday June 2 and
recent opinion polls suggested that Danes would vote against the Treaty.
However, a Gallup poll released on Tuesday showed a swing in favour of
Maastricht for the first time, with 41 per cent in favour and 39 per cent
against the Treaty.
'The market shouldn't get carried away by the opinion polls, especially
given that the polls can get it quite wrong,' warned one trader, adding that
'the reaction (to the polls) could be overdone'.
Traders said 10-year yield spreads over German government bonds have
narrowed slightly since the beginning of April - when negative polls pushed
the yield spread to about 95 basis points - to about 87 basis points
recently.
Elsewhere in Europe, the government bond markets were generally lacklustre
ahead of the Ascension Day holiday.
German government bonds opened weaker, following the fall in US Treasury
bonds overnight, and traded in a narrow range with the Liffe bund futures
contract moving between 87.65 and 87.76. The contract closed at 87.70,
slightly lower on the day.
Traders said the release of cost-of-living data for Bavaria had little
impact on the bund market. The month-on-month rise was 0.3 per cent, with a
5 per cent rise year-on-year. Inflation for Germany as a whole is expected
to be around 4.5 per cent for May.
The UK government bond market ended the day slightly higher, but continued
to make rather heavy weather of the latest gilt tranche issued by the Bank
of England.
Dealers reported little interest in the Pounds 800m tranche of 9 per cent
Conversion stock due 2000. 'The market is suffering from indigestion just
now, following the large amount of issuance since the election,' warned one
trader.
The Liffe futures contract traded in a range of 99.14-99.24, and ended the
day at 99.19.
Japanese government bonds fell yesterday prompted by a drop in the Tokyo
stock market, the overnight fall in US Treasury bond prices, higher crude
oil prices and the supply of new 10-year bonds at yesterday's auction.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 opened at 5.565 per cent, and ended the
day at 5.585 per cent after trading in a range of 5.56-5.59 per cent.
The finance ministry held its auction of 10-year bonds as expected, and
announced a coupon of 5.6 per cent - which is lower than the 5.7 per cent
coupon seen on the May issue.
The ministry sold Y472.74bn (or 60 per cent of the total Y800bn issue) at an
average price of 99.53 to yield 5.673 per cent. The lowest accepted bid at
the auction was 99.40, yielding 5.694 per cent. The rest of the issue was
placed with the members of the underwriting syndicate.
Traders said the fall in the stock market contributed to the generally
bearish sentiment, as the Nikkei average index ended down 382.08 points at
17,822.56 yesterday.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KAWASAKI Heavy Industries, a leading Japanese shipbuilder, reported a sharp
fall in operating profits because of foreign exchange losses and higher
costs for construction of liquefied natural gas carriers.
For the year to end-March, operating profits fell 21.7 per cent to Y32.8bn
(Dollars 254.2m), in spite of a 4.4 per cent rise in sales to a record
Y931.3bn.
Pre-tax profits rose 0.2 per cent to Y20.5bn. After-tax profits fell 16.4
per cent to Y9.4bn because of a 58.6 per cent increase in tax to Y11.1bn.
Kawasaki managed to recoup the fall in operating profits with the sale of
securities, which rose by 2.7 times from Y5bn the previous year.
For the current year Kawasaki expects shipbuilding growth to buoy revenue,
and forecasts a 4.1 per cent increase in sales to Y970bn and a 9.8 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits to Y22.5bn.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Mixed results posted by Japan's
drugs sector - New Products Boost The Bottom Lines Of Some Leading
Pharmaceutical Companies

<TEXT>
JAPAN's top pharmaceutical companies have revealed mixed results for the
year to March, with those marketing new products recording strong
performances and others turning in lower profits.
Sankyo, the second largest in the industry, posted solid earnings for the
period thanks to sales of Mevalotin, its anti-hyperlipedemic drug.
Yamanouchi Pharmaceutical, with its anti-ulcer treatment, and Tanabe
Seiyaku, which posted a 6.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y13.1bn
(Dollars 101.55m), also benefited from strong sales of some products.
But Takeda Chemical Industries, Japan's largest drug maker, saw profits drop
while Fujisawa Pharmaceutical posted a 16.3 per cent fall in pre-tax profits
as sales of its anti-ulcer drug failed to reach expected levels.
Takeda's after-tax profits fell 12.5 per cent to Y32.5bn partly reflecting
capital losses from a typhoon. Fujisawa recorded higher non-operating costs
because of a rise in funding expenses.
Other companies unveiling lower pre-tax profits included Eisai, which
reported a 9.5 per cent decline to Y31.2bn, and Dainippon Pharmaceutical,
with a drop of 10.5 per cent to Y9.4bn.
For the current year to March 1993, Japanese pharmaceutical companies face
the effects of an official drug price cut approved by the Ministry of Health
and Welfare in April.
The impact on companies with heavy dependence on sales of antibiotics is
expected to be greater than on the industry as a whole. Mr Mitsuo Ohmi,
pharmaceutical analyst at Barclays de Zoete Wedd in Tokyo, said that the
sector would need to introduce new high-margin products to offset price
cuts.
Takeda forecasts a 0.2 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to Y71.5bn on a
3.4 per cent rise in sales to Y580bn, while Sankyo expects a 12 per cent
rise in pre-tax profits to Y58bn on a 7 per cent increase in sales to
Y385bn.

<TEXT>
CANADIAN Imperial Bank of Commerce, the biggest lender to Olympia and York,
has set aside a special provision of CDollars 1bn to cover possible losses
from the debt-burdened property developer.
As a result of this provision, the bank suffered a second-quarter loss of
CDollars 440m (USDollars 370m) or CDollars 2.55 a share, compared with
earnings of CDollars 186m or 90 cents in the three months to April 30 1991.
CIBC said that despite the big second-quarter loss, it was confident of a
profit for fiscal 1992 as a whole, and that it had no plans to cut its
dividend.
The report by CIBC, Canada's second biggest financial institution, is the
first time the bank has discussed its exposure to O&amp;Y. It said that its
total exposure to O&amp;Y is CDollars 860m, somewhat lower than analysts had
estimated. About half of the loans apply to the Canary Wharf project in
London's Docklands, with the rest split between properties in the US and
Canada.
The CDollars 1bn provision covers not only the O&amp;Y exposure, but also an
unidentified troubled account in Australia, and possible further losses due
to the poor business conditions in Canada.
Mr Donald Fullerton, who retires as chairman next week, said the bank
considers the provision to be sufficient to 'cover a wide range of
developments' and 'to put the O&amp;Y problem behind us'.

EQUITABLE Life Assurance, one of the largest US insurance companies,
reported an after-tax loss of Dollars 13m during the first quarter of 1992,
compared with a loss of Dollars 14.6m in the same period a year earlier,
according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission.
The life insurer, currently converting from mutual to shareholder-owned
status, added that improvements in its operating performance will depend on
the company's ability to improve returns from certain classes of general
account investment assets.
Surrenders and withdrawals in the first quarter were Dollars 571.4m, down
15.7 per cent on the first three months of 1991. Surrenders in 1991 overall
totalled Dollars 2.39bn, up 37 per cent on the previous year.
Pre-tax profits from continuing operations during the first quarter totalled
Dollars 25.3m, against Dollars 53.3m a year earlier.

<TEXT>
VARITY Corp, the loss-making international farm equipment, automotive and
industrial machinery group, came close to breaking even in the first
quarter, thanks to a 21 per cent boost in sales, higher margins and foreign
currency gains.
The net loss narrowed to USDollars 2.4m, or 28 cents a share, from Dollars
37.3m, or Dollars 1.67 a share, a year earlier. Revenues climbed to Dollars
823m from Dollars 681.5m.
The biggest improvement was at Kelsey-Hayes, the Michigan-based automotive
parts maker, whose sales climbed by almost a third to Dollars 389m, with
operating profit doubling to Dollars 31m. Varity acquired Kelsey-Hayes less
than three years ago, but automotive products now account for 47 per cent of
the parent's sales and more than two-thirds of operating profits.
Operating income of the Perkins diesel engine group climbed by 29 per cent,
while Massey-Ferguson, the farm machinery maker, broke even, against a
Dollars 9m loss last year. But Pacoma, a German hydraulic systems unit,
remains in the red, with a Dollars 1m first-quarter loss. Varity is rumoured
to be seeking a buyer for Pacoma.
Mr Victor Rice, chairman, predicted continued improvement.

profits for year
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO of Japan's leading oil distributors, Mitsubishi Oil and Cosmos Oil,
yesterday announced record profits for the year to end-March.
Mitsubishi Oil said its 9.7 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y23.5bn
(Dollars 182.1m) was due to lower interest rates and substantial foreign
exchange gains.
The company also saw increased sales of higher-valued petroleum products,
which limited the effect of a 4.4 per cent decline in revenues to Y1,041bn,
the result of lower crude oil prices and the appreciation of the yen.
Net profit grew by 22.9 per cent to Y13.6bn. The dividend was raised to Y8
from Y7.50.
Mitsubishi Oil expects higher sales, but lower pre-tax profits for the
current fiscal year.
Cosmos Oil had its best profits since its creation in 1986 as a result of
the merger of Daiky Oil and Maruzen Oil. Pre-tax earnings climbed by 55.5
per cent to Y27.8bn, while net profits surged by 90.6 per cent to Y19.4bn.
Sales fell by 7.7 per cent to Y1,581bn.

MITSUBISHI Rayon and Teijin, two of Japan's leading synthetic fibre makers,
yesterday reported lower pre-tax profits for the year to end-March.
Mitsubishi Rayon's pre-tax earnings fell by 23 per cent to Y9.5bn (Dollars
73.6m) because of a growing deficit in financial items. Net profit dropped
by 30.8 per cent to Y4.2bn.
It was Mitsubishi Rayon's first profit decline since 1987, and the company
expects earnings to slide further to Y8bn this fiscal year. Net profit is
also predicted to tumble to Y4bn in the current year.
Sales fell by 1 per cent to Y272.5bn due to slow turnover in the non-fibre
business, particularly resins. A slight recovery is expected this year.
Teijin blamed its 22.3 per cent fall in pre-tax earnings to Y26.7bn on
stagnant sales of non-fibre products.
Sales during the last fiscal year rose by 4.1 per cent to Y339.1bn and are
expected to increase to Y350bn this year.
Net profit decreased by 26.7 per cent to Y14.8bn and is expected to fall to
Y11bn.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Spectre of losses dogs US
carriers / Outlining the well-founded anxieties of American Airlines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bob Crandall has never lacked a punchy comment. Even so, the outspoken
chairman of American Airlines seemed to attain fresh levels of exasperation
last week when he assessed US carriers' prospects.
'This isn't a game,' he told assembled media after his company's annual
meeting. 'This is deadly serious. This industry is going down the tubes.'
Mr Crandall has a point. In the first three months of 1992, with the economy
supposedly recovering and the Gulf War a distant memory, only two US
airlines - American and its much smaller Dallas-based neighbour, Southwest -
made any money at all.
In American's case, the operating profit was a skeletal Dollars 137m, on
revenues of Dollars 3.5bn.
Grim first-quarter figures may be only the beginning of the year's bad news.
Many US analysts believe that the sector will be lucky to make any money in
1992.
'We were forecasting a very marginal profit, between break-even and Dollars
500m,' says Lee Howard at Airline Economics, the Washington-based
consultancy. 'Now, it could be the bottom-end of that range.'
Avmark, another aviation consultancy, is bleaker still, suggesting that
losses may start to approach the levels seen in 1991. That was when the nine
surviving national carriers (excluding Pan Am, which went out of business in
October), produced a horrendous Dollars 1.63bn deficit after tax.
Either way, if such Cassandra-like predictions are correct, 1992 will become
the third successive year in which the US airline industry has failed
miserably to line its coffers. Accumulated losses for the nine carriers over
the three-year period may range upwards of Dollars 5bn.
The explanation for the flood of red ink is simple. In spite of all the
airline bankruptcies, staff cuts and pruned capital spending plans, there is
a continuing mismatch between domestic capacity and costs on the one side,
and demand/revenues on the other. The chief questions are: when will matters
improve; and can anything be done to accelerate recovery?
The cost side, however, has not been unremittingly bleak. The price of fuel,
accounting for 15 per cent-plus of any airline's operating expenses, has
fallen year-on-year, although it has been rising again recently.
United Airlines calculates that it paid about 62 cents per gallon of jet
fuel in the first three months of 1992; down from 83 cents in the first
quarter of 1991. A one cent reduction in fuel prices adds Dollars 130m to
the industry's annual profits.
Labour costs, meanwhile, amount to another 30 per cent of operating
expenses, and some carriers have secured concessions here.
For example, USAir reached a new agreement with its pilots, involving salary
cuts. Even the mighty Delta, which set the pace for pilots' pay with a
three-year contract in 1990, won agreement from employees to extend the deal
for a further 16 months.
Instead of receiving a 12.5 per cent rise over three years, pilots will
receive 14.5 per cent over four and a half years.
On the revenue side, mitigating circumstances are harder to find. While
international traffic recovered swiftly from the Gulf War hiatus,North
America's huge domestic market remains moribund. According to the Air
Transport Association (ATA), US passenger traffic fell last year, for the
first time in a decade.
Revenue passenger miles were flat, and the number of passengers slipped by
nearly 1 per cent. Scheduled capacity, however, increased by 2 per cent.
The first four months of 1992 have been no better, with revenue passenger
miles down by 1.1 per cent year-on-year and available seat miles up by 1.9
per cent. That hurts, because in spite of all their expensive route
acquisitions, in Europe and Asia, US carriers remain heavily dependent on
domestic traffic. American, for example, drew more than three-quarters of
its revenues from the US last year.
With demand flat, that leaves pricing - and here matters are more complex.
Last month, American announced a fares offensive. Essentially, its domestic
price structure will be streamlined into four basic fare classes: first
class; full coach; 7-day advance; and 21-day advance.
The first two classes will be substantially cheaper than comparable
'pre-streamlining' fares, but will dispense with the myriad of discount fare
schemes, corporate concessions, and so on.
It is easy to see why American felt the need to act. ATA figures show that
'discount' traffic accounted for 94.9 per cent of total domestic travel in
1991, compared with 70.6 per cent a decade earlier.
The 'average' discount, moreover, increased from 46.2 per cent in 1981 to
65.6 per cent 10 years later. American itself was offering about 500,000
separate fares ahead of the overhaul. Post-streamlining, this was reckoned
to reduce to 70,000; a significant cost-saving.
But many analysts interpreted the move mainly as a bid to stimulate business
travel or at least to persuade business travellers to pay for convenient
full-coach tickets (albeit cheaper than before), rather than have them
scramble around the discount offerings.
American acknowledged it would see a net revenue loss short-term, but hoped
this could be recouped by increased demand.
One month later, it is questionable whether the strategy has worked. The
largest carriers immediately matched American. But, within days, financially
troubled carriers like TWA, USAir and Continental, were undercutting. Only
this week Northwest Airlines introduced a two-for-one leisure fare during
the summer season on domestic flights and some carriers have followed suit.
Today, Mr Crandall defends his overhaul. He says the simplified fare
structure is still in place, even if the level of fares is lower than
anticipated.
He claims that about 30 per cent of the fares now being booked are full
coach. 'We are not displeased,' he says defiantly. 'We're getting the change
in mix, but yields will be lower than we thought.'
Analysts beg to differ. They point out that various corporate discounts are
still available. Moreover, even on a simple route like Washington-New York,
there are a dozen published fares, three times the number which the
'simplified pricing' strategy was supposed to create. At least one analyst
claims the fare structure overhaul is deteriorating rapidly.
Some cynics suspect that American's objectives were two-fold from the
outset. Even if the overhaul failed, it would at least put further pressure
on the financially-distressed, undercutting carriers, and hopefully push
them from the skies. American denies this.
The fact is, however, that airlines in the US do not die easily. So long as
assets can be sold or further credit secured, debt-burdened carriers have
survived for years, especially under bankruptcy court protection.
Eastern, Pan Am and Midway only collapsed when the cash ran out. So,
although consolidation is taking place, the process - for the survivors - is
painfully slow.
Moreover, even if the financially-troubled carriers disappear, there remains
the competitive threat from Southwest, the highly-successful low-cost
airline.
By avoiding all the costs of a national hub network and by retaining its
lean structure, Southwest can regularly undercut its bigger rivals and still
make a profit.
Mr Crandall acknowledges that something may have to be done. Options being
considered include pulling American out of some particularly tough markets,
or introducing a rival low-cost service.
Many analysts think that the most the industry can expect is a long wait
until domestic traffic revives, until undercutting slackens off as a result
of failures, and until demand starts to reflect supply more closely. That
may start to happen in 1994. Mr Crandall is less phlegmatic: 'Either this
industry fixes itself, or the US is not going to have an industry.'

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Maughan to be chairman of
Salomon securities arm
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
A WEEK after paying a Dollars 290m government fine to settle charges that it
had rigged billion-dollar Treasury bond auctions, Salomon Inc yesterday
appointed Mr Deryck Maughan as chairman and chief executive of its powerful
Wall Street securities subsidiary, Salomon Brothers.
The move, which had been expected, paves the way for the departure of Mr
Warren Buffett who took over as chairman of the parent group last August
after the bond trading scandal which toppled the firm's senior management.
Mr Buffett pledged a few months ago to step down as chairman of Salomon Inc
once the government's investigation was completed, and is expected to
announce his successor soon. No names have been put forward for the job, but
Mr Buffett has already expressed his preference for an independent chairman
without previous ties to the group's two main business units, Salomon
Brothers and Phibro, the oil trading firm.
Mr Maughan's appointment is a reward for his efforts in helping the firm
survive the crisis that engulfed it last summer when federal authorities
discovered bond traders at Salomon had been faking customer orders in
Treasury auctions to get around government restrictions.
While Mr Buffett handled the political and strategic issues of the scandal,
Mr Maughan set about restructuring Salomon's securities trading operations.
Within a few months management structures were redesigned, business
priorities reshaped, and the firm's compensation system overhauled.
Although this created upheaval within the firm and led to defections by some
senior staff, the new Salomon which emerged from the changes was widely
regarded as a better managed, more efficient firm, albeit one still badly
rattled by the scandal and the subsequent loss of business.
Mr Maughan said yesterday he regarded his appointment as 'more an
affirmation of what we've been working on for the past year, than any signal
of a radical departure'.

sales

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEGUSSA, the German metals, chemicals and pharmaceuticals group, made
pre-tax profits of DM100m (Dollars 60.6m) in the first half of the current
year, 7 per cent up on the DM93m made in the same period last year. This was
despite a drop in turnover from DM6.55bn to DM6.08bn.
The company - which has said that it planned to cut 1,000 jobs to reduce
costs - said that the second quarter of the year had been better than
expected.
Group profits for the year are likely to be better than last year's, it
said. In the year to September 30 1991, pre-tax profits were DM179 - 44 per
cent down on the previous year.
The expected improvement for the year would be due to rationalisation
measures at the Laybold machinery subsidiary and at the parent company,
together with good results in the pharmaceuticals and dental products
markets, rather than any fundamental turnround in the economy.
At the parent company level, pre-tax profits fell to DM57m from DM70m in the
half-year.
Horten, Germany's fourth largest retailer, is set to embark on a slimming
down exercise which will involve a 'significant' but as yet unspecified
reduction in staff numbers, the company said yesterday. The purpose of the
rationalisation is to improve profitability.
Horten yesterday reported a 4.5 per cent drop in sales during the first five
months of 1992.

Renault

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE French cabinet yesterday named Mr Louis Schweitzer, managing director of
Renault, as chairman of the state-owned car group, the first of more than 40
top state sector jobs due for review in the next few months.
He was put forward by Mr Raymond Levy, his predecessor, who has retired
after six years at the wheel. He also has the support of Volvo, the French
group's Swedish partner, with which Mr Schweitzer negotiated an alliance two
years ago. Mr Schweitzer is expected to continue to follow Mr Levy's
strategies, a smooth succession which sets the tone for nominations of other
state sector chairmen.
Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the prime minister, has said he wants to ensure
management continuity in state-controlled companies, especially important at
a time when the government is embarking on a programme of privatisations.
The nominations are also important to the economy generally, as seven of
France's top 10 companies are state-owned.
Mr Beregovoy's unwillingness to interfere in the professional management of
the state sector contrasts with the more hands-on approach of his
predecessor, Mrs Edith Cresson.
This is also a contrast to the last time the mandates of state company
chairmen came up for renewal, in 1989, when up to a third of the 43 people
then involved resigned or were asked to leave.
Stock market expectation is that change is least likely at the heads of
industrial heavyweights such as Usinor Sacilor, the steel group, Elf
Aquitaine and Total in oil, Rhone-Poulenc in chemicals, the Pechiney
aluminium group and Air France.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: US phone companies in Dollars
2.85bn merger
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SPRINT, the third largest US long distance telephone company, and Centel, a
large Chicago-based local telephone company, last night announced plans to
merge through an exchange of shares which values Centel at Dollars 2.85bn.
The deal, announced after the New York Stock Exchange closed for the day, is
the latest example of a wave of consolidation sweeping through the US
telecommunications industry.
Centel announced last January that it would consider putting itself up for
sale as part of a review of strategy options. But the nature of last night's
deal, and the price put on the Chicago company, took the market by surprise.
The merger, which is expected to be tax free to shareholders of both
companies, involves the conversion of each share of Centel's common stock
into 1.37 shares of Sprint stock. Sprint's closing price of Dollars 24 1/2
values each Centel share at Dollars 33.56 and the whole company at Dollars
2.85bn. Centel shares closed at Dollars 42 1/2 , up Dollars  3/4 .
The combined group, of which Centel will own 35 per cent, will retain the
Sprint name and will have an asset book value of nearly Dollars 14bn. Mr
William Esrey, Sprint's chairman and chief executive, will retain these
titles while Mr Jack Frazee, chairman of Centel, will become president and
chief operating officer.
Mr Esrey pointed out that the combined company would be the only one in the
US which operated in all three large telecommunications markets.
The three markets are: long distance, which provides Sprint with Dollars
5.5bn of its Dollars 8.8bn annual revenues; local services, where Sprint
serves 4m lines in 17 states and Centel has 1.6m lines in six states, four
of them common to Sprint; and cellular communications, where Centel operates
in more than 40 metropolitan areas and over 50 rural ones.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Expected Ilva loss ends hopes of
listing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ILVA, the Italian public-sector steel company controlled by the IRI state
holding company, is expected to report a loss of up to L450bn (Dollars 371m)
when its 1991 results are announced next week.
The figure, which has to be approved by IRI, would banish hopes by the
company, created from the ashes of the ill-fated Finsider steel group, to
float part of its shares on the stock exchange this year.
Under Italian bourse rules, companies must show three straight years of
profits before they can list their equity. Ilva, which took its present form
in 1988, made net profits of L208bn in 1989 and L115bn in 1990. Its 1991
results, which have been severely hit by the current crisis in the European
steel industry, have been eagerly awaited by bankers and politicians as a
further indication of the government's privatisation plans.
The decision to show a loss for 1991 represents a substantial change of
strategy for Ilva. The company had until recently been conducting a series
of substantial asset sales to create a large capital gain to counterbalance
losses on the industrial side and close the year with a modest profit.
Mr Giovanni Gambardella, Ilva's chief executive, said yesterday it had
instead decided to allocate the capital gain, amounting to around L450bn, to
a special 'restructuring fund' to help overcome its current difficulties.
Ilva realised around L150bn from the sale of its Rome headquarters. Further
gains have come from the disposal of its 49 per cent stake in the Sidermar
shipping group and various electricity generating activities. Meanwhile,
capital gains of L150bn have been derived from the transformation of its
Piombino long-products division into a separate company.
Despite Ilva's failure to meet the bourse's profitability criterion. Mr
Gambardella left the door open for a possible future quotation. That could
come via a reverse takeover into a company already listed on the stock
exchange, a technique commonly used in Italy.
One candidate would be Dalmine, the north Italian tube-maker in which Ilva
has a 66 per cent stake. However, Ilva officials said the use of a quoted,
but dormant, company from another part of the public sector was the more
likely solution.

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Forced to swallow a slimming diet - The
mixed fortunes of Wasserstein Perella
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SIGHT of bid specialists eking out a meagre diet of deals is commonplace
these days. But few investment banking firms can have feasted so well and
then fared so poorly as Wasserstein Perella.
Three years ago, this was the epitome of Wall Street 'chutzpah'. The
business was formed in 1988 by Bruce Wasserstein and Joseph Perella, a
couple of investment banking 'stars', who walked out of First Boston and set
up shop on their own. A team of fellow-defectors followed - more than 20 in
all - and the fledgling company quickly added top-level talent from other
Wall Street houses and law firms.
Within months, 'Wasserella' seemed to have a role in most of the mega-deals
of the late-80s. These included Time's Dollars 13.4bn bid for Warner
Communications; Al Checchi's Dollars 3.6bn offer for Northwest Airlines;
Philip Morris's Dollars 13bn acquisition of Kraft; and the Dollars 25bn bid
by Kolhberg, Kravis Roberts for RJR Nabisco.
On the cross-border front, the firm was used by the likes of Martin Sorrell
at WPP in his pursuit of the US-based Ogilvy Group.
Wasserella itself went overseas in the hotly-contested battle for control of
Gateway in 1989. It stepped in, where KKR seemingly feared to tread, and
subsequently invested a third of its Dollars 1.1bn buy-out fund in
subscribing for a 40 per cent share of Isosceles' equity.
In 1989, its first full year, Wasserella ranked third in the league table of
bid advisers - outclassing Wall Street stalwarts such as Merrill Lynch and
Salomon Brothers. Partners airily complained if journalists described the
business as a 'boutique'.
Today, the picture couldn't be more different. Wasserella's profile has
dipped so low that computer searches show the firm featuring in only four
big US newspaper headlines since the start of 1991. According to Securities
Data, its ranking in the M&amp;A league tables slipped to eighth place in 1990,
12th place last year, and then 15th in the first quarter of 1992.
In New York, the firm defends this drop in the rankings by saying that it is
the contrast that looks so marked. 'We almost seem to have to apologise for
having done three big deals in 1989,' says Mr Mike Biondi, a partner at WP.
Moreover, with the US bid scene moribund, it is impossible to tell whether
large clients such as Philip Morris would employ the firm in the future.
What can be said with certainty is that some of Wasserella's least
successful deals have attracted far more publicity than those which
'worked'.
In the UK, the tribulations at WPP and Isosceles have easily overshadowed
the SmithKline Beecham merger. In the US, Northwest and Time Warner get more
attention than Philip Morris/Kraft.
But the story doesn't quite end there. Even by the late-80s, the media was
speculating that Wasserella's desire to earn success-related fees caused it
to push deals too hard and overstep the 'best practice' mark.
A severe admonishment was handed down by the Delaware Supreme Court, which
accused Bruce Wasserstein of weighting the auction for Macmillan, which he
was defending, in favour a KKR-led buy-out.
Wasserstein's manipulation of journalists was then given some play in
'Barbarians at the Gate', the best-selling book about the RJR Nabisco
takeover. And, in the course of the Gateway battle, Wasserella managed to
breach UK bid ethics - giving the impression that it would not accept the
rival Isosceles offer, before doing just that. It was legally defensible,
but a tactless debut.
Perhaps the worst embarrassment flowed at Interco, a St Louis-based company
which had wanted to see off some hostile raiders in the late-80s.
Wasserstein advised on a Dollars 2.8bn 'recapitalisation' plan. This
involved Interco taking on large debts and paying out a special dividend. It
later went into liquidation.
Last year, an independent examiner determined that the 'recap' rendered
Interco insolvent - in short, fraudulent conveyance. But she spread the
blame widely, saying that WP provided services 'acceptable by investment
banking industry standards', and was hampered by incomplete information from
management.
Last month, Wasserella finally put the affair behind it: noting the
'unpredictability of jury trials' and admitting no liability, it settled a
secondary lawsuit related to the Interco affair for Dollars 18.25m (Pounds
10.3m).
In fairness, if Wasserella was pushy for clients, it was equally ambitious
on its own account. It set up branch offices in London, Frankfurt and Paris,
and formed a partnership with Nomura, swapping 20 per cent of its equity for
a Dollars 100m investment.
Today, the value of this strategy is debatable. A glance at the recent list
shows a high proportion of cross-border deals - 27 of the 39 WP transactions
listed by Securities Data as completed in 1991 or 1992 had a cross-border
element. The biggest US deal was an Dollars 805m merger between two
California-based companies.
Nevertheless, the international overheads have sometimes been quite high; in
the UK, for example, Wasserella spent millions on a property in St James's
just before the market slumped. (It did better on its New York offices,
where the lease comes up for renewal next year).
The timing of the Nomura deal was unfortunate, given subsequent Japanese
retrenchment. And rival advisers might also quibble about WP's precise role
in some of the deals listed.
The Dollars 1.1bn Wasserstein buy-out fund, meanwhile, is heavily dependent
on the Isosceles investment. In terms of funds invested, this accounts for
about one third of the total monies raised. Another third is unspent, and
the remaining holdings - which range from a stake in the Yardley-Lentheric
toiletries business to Wickes - are a mixed bag.
In fairness Wasserella has made efforts to diversify its core business,
offsetting the slump in bid work. Total staffing is still put at some 120
professionals, but the number concentrating on mergers and acquisitions work
has fallen from about 100 to more like 75. In compensation, trading and
underwriting activities have been built up.
Yesterday, the firm continued on this track, announcing the formation of a
subsidiary which will advise on mortgage loans and mortgage securities.
And, publicly at least, the firm remains confident that the bid business
will offer rewards long-term. 'With all the consolidation going on, there's
going to be a lot of M&amp;A work,' says Mr Biondi, a little defiantly.
Who snares it, when it does return, remains the question.

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: A badly-timed deal in an evolving
marketplace / A look at the problems facing Isosceles as it plans a
reflotation of the Gateway chain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON A table in the middle of the Isosceles boardroom stands a handsome gold
clock commemorating a bond issue launched by the previous owners of the
Gateway supermarket chain. The clock was presented to the company by a
finance house which earned fee income from the issue. It is running two
hours late.
Although it marks a past event in Gateway's corporate history, the clock is
highly symbolic of its current fate: first, because it emphasises the
company's dependence on its bankers; and second, because it suggests that
Gateway's current owners have got their timing badly wrong.
When the Isosceles investment company bought Gateway in the summer of 1989
in a highly-leveraged Pounds 2.1bn deal, the biggest of its kind in UK
corporate history, high hopes were held out that the company could be
stripped down and spruced up and returned to the market within three to five
years. Peripheral assets would be sold, the core strengths of the business
would be revealed and a generous return would be generated for the backers
of the controversial deal.
Three years on, the picture looks very different. Still weighed down by
Pounds 1.3bn of debt, with its trading position deteriorating daily,
Isosceles is beginning to face up to the realities of an agonising dilemma:
how it can possibly return the company to the market without just
crystallising substantial losses for its investors?
Such thoughts will dominate the minds of both the company and its bankers
this summer as they sit down to review the results of Gateway's financial
year, which has just ended, and its development programme, which has just
begun.
The talks are likely to be tense. City analysts suggest Gateway has
performed poorly over the past year as a result of a further loss of market
share to its voracious rivals, such as J Sainsbury, Tesco and Safeway.
The company's cash flow is believed to be lower than budgeted and some of
its banking covenants may well be breached. A Pounds 100m bond is repayable
in April next year.
Further complications may arise when Ernst &amp; Young, Isosceles' auditors, go
through the books in detail. Industry observers suggest the auditors may
legitimately raise questions about the carrying values of some of the
company's properties. An asset write-down may well result.
Yet in spite of these weighty concerns, Mr Alistair Mitchell-Innes,
Isosceles' chief executive, betrays few signs of nervousness. Relaxed and
reassuring, he brushes aside the doubts in the manner of a polished diplomat
dismissing some local trouble in a far-away country.
Although he only became chief executive last September, he accepts that
Isosceles' original time-table has been disrupted. Isosceles was able to
dispose of 60 superstores to Asda for Pounds 705m soon after the completion
of the acquisition but other assets have been far harder to sell.
'The market for assets collapsed fairly soon after the acquisition and they
were unable to pay down debt as quickly as they would have liked,' he says,
although he adds that Isosceles is still planning to return Gateway to the
market within the next 18 months to two years.
He suggests, however, that Isosceles' cash constraints - and next year's
bond repayment - will be eased by the end of the calendar year through the
sale of Herman's, its US sporting goods subsidiary, and the flotation of
Wellworths, its highly profitable Irish grocery chain.
The problem with this scenario is that Herman's has been on the market for a
long time to no avail. Industry gossip has it that Isosceles turned down a
Pounds 200m offer for Herman's soon after the acquisition and would now be
lucky to receive Pounds 80m.
Wellworths may be sold to a trade buyer before flotation for about Pounds
150m, although one interested party, Fitzwilton, the Irish investment group,
is believed to have dropped out of the running in recent weeks.
However, although these sales may help tide Isosceles over in the short term
they will not solve its acute strategic challenge of how to create a
profitable growth business out of its 635 high street stores.
Mr Mitchell-Innes accepts Isosceles must have a plausible story to tell
before it can hope to return to the market. 'In my view a flotation would
only be sensible when we have enough evidence and enough stores to show that
we have a serious retail proposition which is profitable,' he says.
He argues that Gateway has already achieved a great deal in improving the
profitability of the core business. Costs have been cut, 1,000 jobs have
been taken out of Gateway's head office and eight distribution centres have
been closed. 'People say that all the easy things have been done although
they are not so easy when you have to do them.'
But Mr Mitchell-Innes is pinning the company's hopes for growth on the
launch of new retail formats. Gateway has already launched an 18-outlet
chain of discount superstores under the banner of Food Giant, utilising the
underperforming space of its remaining superstores. And it is rapidly
converting other stores - currently 25, but up to 150 within the next three
years - to the Somerfield format, an attractive high street chain
emphasising fresh foods.
Next month, Gateway will also experiment with other formats and will launch
four convenience stores, four discount stores based on a recent 'red spot'
price experiment, and four traditional town centre supermarkets.
Some of the names of the regional supermarket chains which were absorbed by
Gateway in its acquisitive days of the 1980s - such as Fine Fare,
International and David Greig - may be re-launched to address different
segments of the food market.
'The expression used is that we are a disparate not a desperate group', says
Mr Mitchell-Innes. 'I see a lot of strengths in our positioning. The grocery
trade has deserted the high street. Not everybody can shop or wants to shop
at superstores.'
While praising the ingenuity of Isosceles' trading experiments, many
analysts doubt the long-term sustainability of these formats. They suggest
that although refits often lead to a short-term boost in profitability they
rarely reverse long-term trends in a store's trading patterns.
Gateway's expansion will also crucially depend on its capital expenditure
budget and this too is under pressure. Mr Mitchell-Innes says Isosceles
invested about Pounds 100m last year although much of that was used to
satisfy basic infrastructure needs to comply with the needs of the Food
Safety Act.
Analysts estimate Gateway only spent Pounds 30m on expanding the business -
about the same as Tesco spends on one of its biggest superstores.
Mr Mitchell-Innes hopes he will be able to increase the company's capital
budget in the future - although he will first have to persuade the bankers
that cash is better used in reinvesting in the business than paying down
debt early. In the meantime, Tesco alone will have built 100 more stores by
1995.
Isosceles plans to announce its annual results in the first week of July -
although they may be delayed by any refinancing talks - and investors will
naturally be keen to hear an update of the flotation plans.
At present, many prominent investment institutions are feeling embarrassed
at their exposure to Isosceles and are staring at uncomfortably high
write-downs on their equity investments. Mercury Asset Management said it
had written down its investment in Isosceles by between Pounds 1m and Pounds
3.5m at March 31, its last financial year end. It refused to specify the
exact amount, or the size of its stake.
Mr Mitchell-Innes is still cautiously optimistic about the prospects for a
flotation. 'Anybody who says that they are absolutely fully confident would
be a fool. I do not know what the market will be like over the next 18
months to two years. But I actually believe that the formula that we have
now is a very good one that will give us the opportunity to find a way to an
exit,' he says.
However, it is increasingly difficult to take issue with the assessment of
one leading rival retailer who argues that the Gateway acquisition was
founded on a fatal misapprehension, compounded by the high price they were
forced to pay as a result of a bidding war.
He argues that the main architects of the deal, Mr David Smith and Ms
Elizabeth Hignell (who were later forced out of the company with a shared
Pounds 1.8m pay-off) constructed complex cash flow models showing that
Isosceles could generate a healthy return on its investment.
But in his view, they failed to understand the commercial dynamics of the UK
market and made their investment calculations on the evidence of the
relatively mature US market where food retailers' future cash flow and
earnings could be predicted with a high degree of accuracy.
'Isosceles completely misread the UK food market. The market here is still
evolving. The ownership of a store does not give you a strong defensive
position because other people are opening stores and continually eroding
your position,' he says.
'But it is the naivety of the City and financial institutions that is really
staggering. Financial men can always talk to the City with greater potency
than retailers. Fund managers - and journalists - were simply wowed by a
compelling story.'

FT  28 MAY 92 / Isosceles may breach banking covenants
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ISOSCELES, the highly-indebted investment company which owns the Gateway
supermarket group, is in negotiations with its banks because it expects to
breach its banking covenants or clauses of its loan contracts.
Bankers with a close knowledge of the group said yesterday that the company
was planning to write to its banks next month outlining the breaches and
explaining the group's long-term strategy, which is to prepare for a stock
market flotation in 1994.
It also emerged yesterday that Isosceles is not currently paying interest in
cash on around Pounds 290m of mezzanine debt, which ranks behind the Pounds
760m of senior bank loans. Instead, this interest is being rolled up and
will be paid in cash or shares, subject to negotiation, at a later date.
However, bankers said that there had been no negotiations to obtain waivers
of cash interest. Provision was made at the end of 1990 for mezzanine
interest to be rolled up if the company were to perform worse than expected.
There are two other reasons why Isosceles needs to amend its loan contracts:
It wants to invest in its new store chains, Somerfield, Food Giant and some
other experimental stores, in the hope that these will improve profitability
and allow the company to be floated. SG Warburg, the merchant bank, is
already working on a flotation.
Proceeds from the planned disposal of Herman's, the US chain of sports
shops, are likely to be much less than the company hoped when its covenants
were agreed three years ago.
However, one banker stressed that Isosceles has to date made all interest
and principal payments when they fell due. Nonetheless, the value of the
company's equity may have fallen, according to some bankers, in view of the
fact that the company has had to defer payment on the mezzanine interest.
Nonetheless, in the latest accounts filed at Companies House by Newgateway,
owner of 40 per cent of Isosceles's equity, no provision has been made for
any fall in the value of the shares. Newgateway is owned by the US
investment bank Wasserstein Perella and its investment clients.
Isosceles does not need the consent of its banks - which include Industrial
Bank of Japan, Canada's Bank of Nova Scotia, Chemical Bank of the US and
Midland, Bank of Scotland and Standard Chartered from the UK - to the
covenant changes until later this year.
Bankers said yesterday that discussions with the company would focus on its
long term strategy.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Profits up 26% at Body Shop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FIRST profit contribution from the US and strong growth in continental
Europe helped The Body Shop International, the beauty products group, to
increase pre-tax profit 26 per cent to Pounds 25.2m in the year to February
29.
Turnover rose from Pounds 115.6m to Pounds 147.4m, with overseas sales
growing 45 per cent to Pounds 61.5m. The group trades in about 40 countries.
Outside the UK, more than 100 store openings took the total to 517, while
the domestic tally went up by 37 to 210.
In the US, where 41 new stores brought the chain to 78, turnover rose 76 per
cent to Pounds 23.4m, overtaking continental Europe, which went up 40 per
cent to Pounds 22.3m.
The group made Pounds 1.5m profit in the US, compared with a Pounds 600,000
loss the previous year when the transplant was at an early stage.
Ms Anita Roddick, managing director, said there were 23 competitors trying
to copy Body Shop in the US but she was confident of staying ahead because
of the company's approach to product development and its campaigning values
 -which she termed a 'magic 2 per cent'.
Overall, overseas trading profits grew 59 per cent to Pounds 11.4m. Mr
Stuart Rose, director, said the share of profit had grown from 33 per cent
to 41 per cent.
With 300 stores seen as the optimum number in the UK, there would be up to
25 openings a year, compared with 130 to 150 overseas.
In the UK, where like-for-like sales growth slowed to 1 per cent, profit
rose 11 per cent to Pounds 16.5m. Mr John Jackson, director, said there was
no sign of a retail recovery. However, through store openings the company
had pushed up sales by 17 per cent.
The company had finished a Pounds 40m investment programme in its Watersmead
site in Hampshire. Most of its products are made in the UK.
The capital spending lay behind an increase in net debt to Pounds 32m, and
gearing of nearly 43 per cent compared with 26 per cent in February last
year. Net interest paid increased to Pounds 2.67m from Pounds 1.95m. On a
slightly lower tax charge, earnings per share rose 31 per cent to 8.8p,
against 6.7p. A final dividend of 0.92p makes a total of 1.6p (1.22p).

FT  28 MAY 92 / Taking a stake in the colony: Chinese-backed group in
HKDollars 3.8bn Hong Kong property move - Agreement underlines the
transformation of commercial relations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mr Deng Xiaoping, the 87-year-old Chinese patriarch, travelled to
Guangdong in January, he was impressed with the pace of economic
development. He left the local Communist party
officials-turned-entrepreneurs with one message: be bolder still.
Three of China's fastest growing communities are taking him at his word. The
governments of Nanhai and Foshan, together with the city of Zhongshan - all
in the Pearl River delta region of Guangdong province - are backing a
consortium which yesterday participated in China's biggest plunge into Hong
Kong's property market.
They agreed to pay HKDollars 3.8bn (Pounds 270m) to Hongkong Land, the
Jardine Matheson property subsidiary, for a slice of prime Hong Kong real
estate. The property, which will be paid for in instalments over the next 18
months, is the recently-developed 9 Queens Road, a 301,000 sq ft office and
retail office block.
The price values the office space at HKDollars 10,000 per sq ft and the
retail space at HKDollars 12,000 per sq ft - prices which analysts say will
lead to a re-rating of landlords, especially Hongkong Land, the colony's
biggest landlord.
The deal puts Hongkong Land in a prime position to assume the lead role in a
Jardine bid to build the colony's ninth container terminal.
It also allows the company to participate in further property development in
Hong Kong, or to take advantage of the distressed market conditions in the
UK.
'We are in strong shape and can move quickly if we find an attractive
investment', said Mr Alasdair Morrison, Hongkong Land's managing director,
'but we are in the fortunate position of being able to wait.'
Two local Hong Kong companies, with impeccable mainland connections, are
part of the Chinese-led consortium: Hongkong Macao Holdings, which will take
10 per cent of the property, and its associate, China Investments, which
will have 5 per cent.
Hongkong Macao is headed by Mr Hu Jinguang, a mainland Chinese businessman.
Little is known about him, except that he left China five years ago for
central America and arrived in the colony last year with a lot of money and
a Panamanian passport.
Mr Hu acquired a controlling interest in Hongkong Macao and, since
September, has invested in Shenzhen's biggest office block, taken a
controlling stake in a Beijing residential and shopping development, and
bought a hotel in Guangzhou (Canton). Hongkong Macao and China Investments
also said yesterday they would be buying 68m sq ft of land in Huizhou,
Guangdong, for a consideration of HKDollars 620m to be paid for by the issue
of shares to a company owned by the city.
The involvement of the two Hong Kong companies leaves the mainland investors
to fund the lion's share of the purchase from Hongkong Land. The mainland
participants undoubtedly have the resources, but how they will fund their
HKDollars 3.23bn obligation has been left unsaid.
However, this commitment to the Hong Kong property market underlines the
transformation which has taken place, in commercial matters at least,
between the colony and the mainland.
Since the beginning of this year, 'China' has been the dominant factor
behind the performance of the Hong Kong stock market. Mainland Chinese
investors have committed large sums to the market, but that is just evidence
of the change in mood. It was primarily British and US investors who took
the Heng Seng index through the 6,000 level this week, to leave it 42 per
cent higher than its 1991 closing level.
China's re-embrace of economic reform, which started with Mr Deng's visit to
the south, has gathered pace and the country is now courting international
investors with renewed vigour. This has heartened local investors who,
sitting in Hong Kong, observe daily the economic miracle taking place across
the border.
Mainland companies have expanded their interest in Hong Kong through all
walks of commercial life, from banking and insurance to transportation,
manufacturing and retailing. Cumulative mainland investment in the colony is
estimated to be in excess of USDollars 10bn (Pounds 5.5bn) - underlining
that trade and investment is two-way - and controlled by literally thousands
of companies.
In April, China Merchants, one of the 'Four Heavenly Kings', as the big
Beijing conglomerates are known in the colony, paid Peninsular &amp; Oriental
Steam Navigation Company Pounds 100m for a 15 per cent interest in container
port operator, Modern Terminals. China Merchants' fleet already ships 10 per
cent of the colony's seaborne trade.
Beijing-based China International Trust and Investment Company through its
listed Hong Kong subsidiary, CITIC Pacific, owns large slices of Cathay
Pacific and Hongkong Telecom and is developing into a 'hong' to rival
Jardine Matheson, Swire and Hutchison.
'Some people view China's purchases of assets in Hong Kong as a threat,'
said Mr Richard Witts of United Mok Ying Kie, a local broker.
'But why put up good money now if they intend to march in and take it come
1997? I think it is a very positive develop-ment.'

FT  28 MAY 92 / Stockbrokers return to profit after surge in market turnover
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK's stockbrokers returned to profit last year after devastating losses
in 1990 - though they managed only a meagre return in one of the most
buoyant recent years for the stock market.
Securities companies which belong to the London Stock Exchange had lost
Pounds 353m in 1990 but managed combined profits of Pounds 286m in 1991, the
exchange said yesterday.
That is equivalent to a return of just over 10 per cent on the capital they
had invested in the market - less than was available last year on risk-free
UK government bonds.
The return to profits, however, was enough to stop the steady attrition that
had seen some banks withdrawing from the market since the 1987 stock market
crash.
The turnround in stockbrokers' fortunes last year was due largely to the 14
per cent leap in turnover on the stockmarket as share prices rose after the
Gulf war. Commissions earned by brokers jumped 19 per cent as a result, to
Pounds 1bn.
The spurt in trading also made it easier for market makers to show a profit:
their profits more than doubled during the year, to Pounds 815m. Also, as
share prices leapt, companies queued up to raise cash by selling shares,
pushing up fees for underwriting and managing new issues to Pounds 301m.
One side effect of the sudden leap in stockbrokers' income was a return of
the staff bonuses that had withered during the lean year of 1990. Bonuses
had amounted to only 7 per cent of the annual brokers' basic salary in 1990.
Last year, they jumped to 22 per cent.
Despite this, securities companies managed to put the lid firmly on their
total staff costs, the single largest expense they face. By holding down
basic salaries, they managed to keep salary increases to just 1 per cent.
Experience in the last quarter of the year and the early part of this year,
however, suggests that salaries are now rising again, the exchange says.
Trading in futures and options showed a surprise loss of Pounds 10m last
year, after a Pounds 41m profit the year before. Stock Exchange Quarterly,
January-March 1992, London Stock Exchange. Pounds 16.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Ms Anita Roddick, the managing director of Body Shop International,
yesterday switched attention to the group's 'green' credentials. The move
came in the wake of controversy about its stance on the issue of animal
testing of cosmetics. At the retailer's first results press conference, Ms
Roddick brandished The Green Book, an environmental audit of the Body Shop's
workings, which gives details of its findings and the subsequent action
taken. On animal testing, Mr Gordon Roddick, chairman (and husband), said
that it was better to use a rolling cut-off - banning ingredients only if
they had been tested on animals within five years - because it allowed
suppliers to be converted to halting such tests.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US administration is proposing the establishment of a multilateral
co-operation council on which its western allies and its former Eastern bloc
adversaries would work jointly to screen sales of sensitive technology to
unstable or outlaw regimes.
The plan was put forward by Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, in a
letter to the foreign ministers of the 16 other western countries which
belong to the Co-ordinating Committee on Multilateral Export Controls
(Cocom). It is expected to be discussed at a high-level Cocom meeting in
Paris next Monday and Tuesday.
US concern has veered increasingly towards the need for controls on trade in
weapons, military and 'dual-use' technologies to governments which are
often-hostile like Iraq, Libya and North Korea.
The Gulf conflict, the collapse of the Eastern bloc and the emergence of
former communist governments which are now starved of hard currency,
therefore might be tempted to sell off their surplus weapons, has
intensified US concerns.
Terming his proposal 'a major undertaking', Mr Baker envisages the
co-operation council as a forum to 'engage the central and eastern European
states and the former Soviet Union in a dialogue on the control of sensitive
technologies'.
He added that it would be modelled 'somewhat after Nato's North Atlantic
Co-operation Council'.
Mr Baker said the new council should provide technical assistance for the
establishment of comparable export control regimes in all of the former
Communist countries and to provide a forum for Cocom 'to address new
strategic threats in co-operation with central and eastern Europe and the
new independent states'.
The co-operation council would also ease access to currently controlled
western technologies to the former Soviet bloc countries.
This proposal is bound to be applauded in Europe, where the US is seen as
dragging its feet on export-control liberalisation, particularly for fibre
optics. A US government official yesterday said fibre optics would be one of
the 'issues' to be discussed next week.
'The co-operation council will provide an effective forum for consultation,
collaboration and reform,' Mr Baker said.

Ambitious Japanese haven't time for the little things in life, such as
visiting mum and dad. A man's got to work, after all.
Hence a long waiting list for the rent-a-family service marketed by a Tokyo
consultancy called Japan Efficiency Headquarters. Just call it up and, for a
mere Pounds 635.59, it will send round substitute sons, daughters and an
optional baby grandchild to visit the parents for three precious hours.
How does the older generation react? Often joyfully, claims the
consultancy's president, greeting the professional actors playing the roles
like the long-lost real thing. Some neglected parents even summon up the
surrogates at their own expense.
Moreover, there's also a growing market for the service the other way round,
with isolated offspring hiring visits by stand-in dads and mums.

It is somewhat ironic that on the very day the Cadbury report on corporate
governance was published, Rolls-Royce should have been given a rough ride
from shareholders.
Instead of getting a warm send-off for piloting the company during the last
seven years through privatisation, doubling its sales and orders and
expanding its market share, Lord Tombs faced stiff questioning at
yesterday's annual meeting from shareholders and former employees on the
company's handling of its voluntary redundancy scheme.
Like its US aero-engine competitors, Rolls-Royce has been forced to make
extensive job cuts. But this has clearly left a bitter feeling among many
employees and small shareholders who voted against a resolution to amend the
directors' executive share option scheme.
Not that Rolls-Royce directors earn extravagant salaries. Tombs's own pay
was reduced last year, and the outgoing chairman pointed out that
Rolls-Royce was in the bottom 10 per cent of the UK directors' salary
league.

Ian Irvine, deputy chief executive of Reed International, is the latest
senior businessman to be sounded out for the top job in ITV - chief
executive of the commissioning system for the new centralised network to be
introduced next year.
Irvine is an inspired choice. He is a serious businessman who would be able
to handle the Pounds 500m or so a year programme budget. On top of that, as
a former chairman of TV-am, he has at least a passing acquaintance with the
colourful ways of Britain's commercial television.
Pay is not a problem. For the right chief executive, up to Pounds 300,000 a
year could be on the table.
The only problem is that Ian Irvine is the latest in a long and
distinguished line to say no. Some TV executives have been heard to ask
plaintively how they can get their names taken off the list.
Those considered capable of doing the job think it would be like sitting on
the original bed of nails at the centre of 15 companies notorious for their
inability to agree on anything. And those who actually want the job are by
definition deemed irredeemably unsuitable.
But there's plenty of time yet. ITV does not expect to have to take a
decision before the end of May.

As Edinburgh muscles into the contest to house the European central bank,
the city is at least showing a touch of realism.
Unlike Luxembourg - which has dug up an arcane EC law dating from the
mid-1960s to support its case for accommodating the new Euro-bankers lock,
stock and barrel - the Scots are advocating the break-up of the institution
even before it exists. The idea is that if bits of it were scattered around
the community, Edinburgh would merit a share.
Although the tactic has style, it is alas no satisfactory answer to the
Germans - rooting noisily for Frankfurt - who argue that Britain's
wishy-washy commitment to full monetary union puts the entire country in a
poor position to claim the prize.
But the real problem, closer to home, seems to be Ian Lang, the Scottish
secretary. Far from fighting Edinburgh's corner in cabinet, all he has
apparently produced so far is a feeble bureaucratic-
sounding letter to the campaigners last month vouchsafing that the
government would give Edinburgh's case 'the most careful consideration'  -
but only if it was decided to go outside London at all.
Indeed the Conservative party as a whole is hardly leading from the front on
the issue. Labour's shadow Scottish secretary Donald Dewar turned out to be
the only politician to speak at yesterday's launch of Edinburgh's campaign.
Not a single Tory minister, MP or as much as a councillor was in evidence.
Meanwhile, the cooler heads in Scotland are hoping that the campaigning may
at least give their capital a leg-up in obtaining some other (unspecified)
EC institution as a consolation prize. In the meantime, there is no harm in
giving the city's claim to be Britain's second financial centre a further
thorough airing.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Risks of too much hot air
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS no such thing as a free breath. This is the point behind the debate
on global warming at the Rio de Janeiro Earth Summit, starting next week.
Anything that comes free of charge will be used to excess. So it is not
difficult to accept, in principle, that as human activity increases, so will
the costs of treating the air as if it were free. The difficulty is knowing
how, and how far, to turn that principle into practice.
The starting point must be the nature of the risks and the costs of reducing
them. The latest World Development Report from the World Bank reports
scientific estimates that mean global temperature might rise by between 1.5'
and 4.5' Celsius, with a best guess of 2.5', as a result of the doubling of
greenhouse gases above their pre-industrial concentrations. But the cost has
been estimated at only about 1 per cent of US gross domestic product. This
seems to be much ado about nothing.
Things are not that simple. As Bill Cline points out in his study of global
warming for the Washington-based Institute for International Economics, the
doubling of greenhouse gases is expected to occur in the first half of the
next century. But global warming is continuous. He offers a central estimate
for global warming of 10' Celsius by 2300, with an upper limit of 18'. Six
per cent of GDP is his best guess of the economic cost, with 20 per cent at
most. More important, such a world would be radically - perhaps horribly -
different from today's.
Nevertheless, even with a low rate of discount, the case for strong action
is not overwhelming. Nor, given the time scale, is it overwhelmingly urgent.
But a benevolent and risk-averse global dictator would, undoubtedly, want to
slow the build up of greenhouse gases, while mounting further studies of the
risks.
Carbon tax
In a world with a multitude of very different states, reaching even so
limited a decision requires much debate. The Rio summit is an excellent
place to start. But the European Community's on-and-off-again carbon tax
shows what is in store.
A carbon tax is the right kind of policy. That said, the proposed tax of
Dollars 10 a barrel would make little difference to the consumption of a
commodity already taxed, on average, more than five times as heavily in the
EC. Nor can much be said in favour of a tax that exempts the most
energy-intensive industries. In short, the EC tax was a gesture. Now EC
ministers have decided not to make that gesture. As a result, the EC's
environment commissioner, Mr Ripa di Meana, has decided to make one himself,
by not going to Rio.
This may be farcical, but the EC has at least stirred things up. It has also
shown how hard it will be to reach international agreements. The lesson
applies globally, but more so.
Hard issues
The issues are hard. First, the setting of uniform targets for emissions
cannot make sense in a world of radically different countries. Second, no
global compact can be agreed and enforced that does not redress the grossly
unequal use of the atmosphere. Last but not least, stabilising carbon
dioxide emissions will hurt.
The World Bank suggests starting with a modest precautionary policy,
focusing on research into global warming, the elimination of subsidies to
wasteful energy use and the development of renewable energy resources.
Afforestation would be part of such a strategy. So would higher taxes on the
use of fossil fuels.
Should the dangers become clearer, property rights in carbon dioxide
emission would need to be agreed, enforced and traded. But these would
entail large redistributions of income. According to the World Development
Report, the industrial world would have had to pay the developing countries
Dollars 70bn to purchase 1988's level of emission, if the right had been
sold at Dollars 25 per ton of carbon.
In the long run, air could become expensive. The political reaction to that
possibility has been illustrated by this week's EC imbroglio over the carbon
tax. But Rio is only a first step. If something like the World Bank's
precautionary programme were implemented now, along with intensified debate,
leading in the long run to property rights in the atmosphere, Rio would be a
breakthrough.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Low-tech risks for high finance: The pressures placed on the
banking system by difficulties in the commercial property market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PLENDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If you had asked a central banker five years ago to identify the most
worrying threats to the banking system, he would probably have talked at
length about the accelerating pace of financial innovation and the
proliferation of complex new financial instruments that were beyond the
capacity of most bankers over the age of 40 to understand. How ironic that
the chief threat in the 1990s comes from that most low-tech and
comprehensible of assets, commercial property.
The collapse of the UK property group Mountleigh, with outstanding debts of
more than Pounds  1/2 bn, and now the likelihood of receivership or
administration for the UK operations of Olympia and York of Canary Wharf
fame, are just the latest in a series of items of bad news for the banks in
property. The Canadian-based Olympia and York is admittedly in a category of
its own, in view of its size and the complexity of its international
financial arrangements.
Yet the decision of the banks to retreat into receivership or administration
at these two troubled groups demonstrates the difficulty of maintaining
support operations where the agreement of numerous creditors is required. At
the same time both these concerns have notably obvious things in common with
other troubled property companies such as Heron International and Speyhawk,
that are the subject of continuing discussions with their bankers, namely
the presence of Barclays and Citicorp.
For the battle-weary in the City, it is tempting to respond to this latest
disaster with a rhetorical question: so what's new? It is now common ground
that the commercial banks vetted individual risks in property lending
without considering the implications for the whole portfolio of loans.
It may seem hard today to grasp how Barclays' outgoing chairman, Sir John
Quinton, could have shared responsibility for an unsustainable 35 per cent
compound growth in the bank's property loan book in the six years to 1991,
far faster than the other clearing banks, given that he had played a central
role in running the clearing banks' lifeboat operation in the fringe banking
and property crisis of the mid-1970s (see chart). Yet it has to be seen, say
the apologists, in the context of the heady climate of the late 1980s.
Nor was Barclays out on its own. Citicorp, once the world's biggest bank,
operated even more impressively in the boom years as a kind of gigantic
corporate centipede. If it shot itself in the foot, it consoled itself with
the thought that there were ever so many feet to go. Alas, by last year it
was down to four feet and the Bank for International Settlements had decreed
that it must have eight to maintain the present volume of lending. Back to
the gun room for further inspiration.
As for the problems of the property market, the existence of a huge
oversupply of space and of the related overhang of Pounds 40bn-plus of bank
debt - three times the level, in real terms, of the last crisis in 1974 -
has been discussed ad nauseam for two years or more. Why should the banking
system suddenly be regarded as subject to an increased threat when its
troubles have been so widely predicted?
The answer is that some things have changed for the worse and not simply
because the British clearing banks have yet to make substantial provisions
against a new round of dud property loans. The banks are engaged in a debt
work-out, similar to the one they conducted in the second half of the 1970s.
Yet the economics of the work-out, in which property companies are nursed
along under the best available management until the market turns up and
property becomes saleable again at worthwhile prices, are very different
this time round.
Barclays provides an interesting case study. At the end of 1991 it had
property and construction loans of Pounds 8.5bn in Britain and more than
Pounds 11bn worldwide, compared with capital of Pounds 9.1bn. That may be
modest by the standards of Japanese city banks, many of which have property
exposure equivalent to two times their capital. But by any other yardstick
it looks high.
Sir John Quinton is nonetheless sanguine about his bank's ability to weather
the property storm and argues that:
at least 70 per cent of the bank's property loans are for completed,
income-producing properties where the tenants have no problem in meeting
debt service;
all the bank's property loans were made at a discount to conservative
valuations and many were made before the peak of the boom;
a total of Pounds 40bn of bank debt is not large in relation to the property
market's estimated overall value of around Pounds 180bn;
the risk in the outstanding debt of the larger troubled property companies
is widely spread around the whole international banking community, so the
individual provisions and write-offs will be less than the size of the
corporate collapses might seem to indicate; and
when economic recovery restimulates tenant demand, institutional and other
investors will readily provide Pounds 10bn of equity to refinance one
quarter of the debt overhang.
On that basis Barclays expects overall provisions not to exceed those in
1991 and possibly to emerge somewhat lower. And yet these seemingly
reassuring points may not be quite as comforting as they appear at first
sight.
One fundamental difference between today's property collapse and the earlier
one in the mid-1970s is the extent of the oversupply, not least in London
offices. There is now 32.4m sq ft of empty office space in the capital,
equivalent to 18 per cent of the total office stock, according to property
advisers Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks. Investment Property Databank, a
leading independent source of property market intelligence, estimates that
central London office rents were plunging in the six months to March at an
annualised rate of 32 per cent. Corporate landlords, including Britain's
biggest, Land Securities, are increasingly finding that properties are let
at rents that exceed today's increasingly depressed market values.
The outcome is a radical shift in the balance of power in favour of the
tenant. Oversupply, according to Mr Norman Bowie, a doyen of the chartered
surveying profession, means that tenants are seeking to use their new
bargaining power to win greater flexibility in the terms of leases. The
market answer to this demand, says Mr Bowie, is shorter leases or leases
with break clauses.
In other words, the 25-year lease with upward only rent reviews - an
inflationary ratchet if ever there was one - is no longer accepted without
demur by tenants. So the lease structure that provided UK property with so
much of its attraction as an institutional investment and a form of bank
collateral is no longer uniform across the market.
The banks' interest cover is thus under threat. Property let at rents above
the prevailing market rate may deliver a lower rental income as leases fall
in. And the changing pattern of leases may ultimately make the banks'
collateral a less attractive asset to the institutional investors which
Barclays expects to help refinance the Pounds 40bn debt overhang. In the
meantime anecdotal evidence from the chartered surveying fraternity suggests
that the valuations on which the banks placed so much faith in the boom are
proving to have been far less conservative than the banks thought.
Prospects on the revenue side of the work-out equation are thus becoming
worse rather than better. And the problem is compounded by a fundamental
change in the way the cost side now operates. Back in the mid-1970s, real
rates of interest were negative at the most stressful point for property
companies. Debt was eroding in real terms and inflation was providing some
help for asset values. This time real rates are positive and the debt burden
is actually increasing. So heavily indebted property companies are caught in
a double bind, with London office rents plunging in nominal terms and the
debt servicing burden rolling up remorselessly in real terms. It becomes
harder with time to close the shortfall of revenue against income, as
compound interest applies its punitive calculus to the figures.
In the absence of a spectacular economic recovery to reactivate the property
market, this means that things will probably get a great deal worse for the
banks before they get better. The work-out will be a far more protracted
affair than in the 1970s and the opportunity cost of putting more money into
rescues will be higher. And there is still no sign that the insurance
companies and pension funds will be ready to take the banks off the hook by
rediscovering their appetite for commercial property.
While Scandinavian-style bank nationalisations are not in question, there
must be some doubt about the ability of the banking system to finance
recovery.
The problem is the huge degree of leverage in bank balance sheets. At
Barclays, capital last year was equivalent to 8.7 per cent of risk-weighted
assets, based on the guidelines of the Bank for International Settlements
and the Bank of England. That 0.7 per cent surplus over the regulatory floor
of 8 per cent is equivalent to Pounds 730m of retained profits.
Just to put that in context, Barclays' dividend last year was uncovered and
retained profits were negative to the tune of Pounds 96m after making
provisions against property and construction in the UK alone of Pounds 245m
 -this, before the latest rash of announcements about Olympia &amp; York and the
rest. Barclays also wrote off more than Pounds 300m against the value of its
own properties to reserves. Looked at from another perspective, Pounds 730m
is equivalent to less than 7 per cent of the value of the total property and
construction loan book. This implies that the capital safety net contains
remarkably little slack.
Such figures clearly raise questions about the ability of the banking system
to finance an economic recovery, especially now that Japanese banks have
been withdrawing from international markets. But provisions and write-offs
are a notoriously impressionistic area of accounting; and the figures above
assume that other things are equal, which may not be the case. With known
losses in the rest of the corporate sector already substantially provided
for and huge losses in overseas subsidiaries now running down, the
underlying profitability of the clearing banks is potentially much
healthier.
Yet their capital ratios remain vulnerable to unexpected shocks. And the
process of recovery will be slower and more painful than any clearing banker
would wish. The British clearers can count themselves luckier than the
Japanese city banks in that they have not been hit by a collapsing stock
market as well as a collapsing property market. But that does not mean that
the latest bout of trouble in property should give the authorities no cause
for concern.
Tomorrow: how doubtful property loans are causing strains in Japan's
financial system.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Arts: Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
On January 2 1815 Lord Byron awoke and found himself married: 'Good God, I
am surely in Hell'. One feels the same watching Mad, Bad and Dangerous to
Know, the life of Byron at The Ambassadors Theatre. One is forced to be
intimate with someone one does not recognise.
This distillation of extracts from Byron's letters, table talk, diaries and
poems is neither mad nor dangerous. Neither is it quintessential Byron, far
from the pan-European hero, exile and archetype who died at Missolonghi in
1824.
The author-director, Jane McCulloch, an experienced writer of
theatre-biography, spreads the action too thinly across the available
material. The enterprise courts superficiality: 36 years of hard living,
facile writing and stormy friendships cannot be compassed in two hours on
stage.
The play's problem starts with its chronological approach. McCulloch rightly
wants one to know the extraordinary life, but in finding sequence, the play
loses focus and depth. Each scene closes neatly, but does not help our
understanding of Byron; instead it offers where he was and when. The
interventions arrive clumsily: 'So here I am at Cambridge' (Byron), 'I like
being Lady in Waiting to Queen Charlotte' (lover) or 'He was well aware that
Don Juan would cause a stir' (narrator).
The difficulties continue by ignoring Byron's misanthropy and melancholy,
'the deep midnight of the mind,' the sense that Byron's life, like Keats's
and Shelley's before him, became a Romantic way of dying. The play lacks the
shadows and inwardness, those essentials of Byronic man. It rarely touches
on the misogyny - 'Do you know? I hate women' - which drove Byron to devote
himself so much to loving and leaving.
It is even more disappointing that Mad, Bad has moments of achieved success,
particularly in the interchanges between Byron and Lady Caroline Lamb, in
'She Walks in Beauty', and in Byron's letter of 1813 warning that pleasure
can be anticipated or recalled, never experienced. These scenes generate
intensity and demand concentration. They need refining and fashioning.
The lighting and music conspire to be culpably anodyne. Both are well but
wrongly done: few changes of lighting give little visual variety; and in a
play about Byron, why not one glimmering taper or midnight study scene? The
music (settings of Byron's poems) is shapely, and accurately sung; but why
not one contemporary line from Schubert or Beethoven?
Mad, Bad and Dangerous to Know survives because of superb acting by both
Derek Jacobi (Byron) and Isla Blair (the women and narrator). They redeem
and carry what should be a much better show. Of course, Byron has a word for
harsh reviewers:
'A man must serve his time to every trade
Save censure - critics all are ready made.'

FT  28 MAY 92 / Technology (Software at Work): Consultant's critique
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GRUMBALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sometimes it pays to go against accepted practice. Steele &amp; Company prefers
to rent rather than buy computer systems. In accounting terms this make
little sense. Since the rental company carries the depreciation charges, it
must pass them on to the customer or make a loss. So the renter pays all the
depreciation and has to add a profit margin on top.
As a balance sheet manipulation technique, it has little to commend it
either. Most auditors treat software as a form of consumable and write it
off in the first year.
Hardware is usually written down straight-line over three years. The
residual value of three-year-old hardware is zero in most cases.
It is only worthwhile if the rental adds some value. For short-term rentals
this value is gained by the flexibility in obtaining and returning the
equipment. Steele &amp; Co gains its value from rental by the ties it creates
with the system provider. Getting support on computers, once installed and
running, is notoriously difficult. By renting, Steele forces the vendor to
be more attentive to problems. It also frees them from risks of failure in
high-cost items.
Steele has also reduced the maintenance costs by a third. Usually, support
contracts cost 15 per cent of the original purchase price. Steele is paying
only 5 per cent of the capital value.
Software is more akin to a subscription than a purchase. Every major PC
software package is updated annually. Each update costs Pounds 50-Pounds 99
which is typically 10 per cent to 30 per cent of the retail price. Most
users take these upgrades without question, providing a steady stream of
revenue to the software developers.
The problems in accepting new technology that Hankey describes are typical.
Computer systems are binary both in their construction and in peoples'
attitudes - either on or off, with nothing in between. A new system is seen
as a panacea by some and a threat by others. As with any tool, the gains are
realised only by perseverance and practice.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Technology (Software at Work): Extending the legal limits -
Phil Manchester continues a series on getting the most out of software by
describing how a firm of solicitors expanded its practice through better use
of computers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Like many other traditional professional organisations in the UK, Steele &amp;
Co, a firm of solicitors based in Norfolk, has had to come to terms with
information technology quickly.
Five years ago, the firm had a few PCs in its single office in Norwich and
employed 20 staff. It now operates nine offices across Norfolk and Suffolk
and employs more than 120 people. They are supported by a computer network
which performs billing, provides word processing and administers accounts.
An integrated network system, based on a mixture of proprietary and Unix
systems, has given the firm an opportunity to find new ways to work. Most
important of all, the system provides management accounting information
which enables Steele to make the best use of its resources.
Tim Hankey, Steele's financial controller, says that the firm's recent
expansion would not have been possible without the computer network, which
now forms the backbone of the practice.
Steele operates in all the traditional areas of law - about 25 per cent of
its income comes from conveyancing; 25 per cent from commercial work, 25 per
cent from litigation; and 25 per cent private clients.
But Steele's approach to running its business is not typical. 'We have a
philosophy of small satellite offices feeding into a larger regional office
and to a central administrative headquarters. This is a somewhat unusual
philosophy for a firm of solicitors and it is only through the IT network
that we can retain control,' Hankey explains.
The network also allows scarce resources, such as legal specialists, to be
shared out in the most efficient way. 'We can't have all of our specialists
at every site. They are at a central or regional site and our general
solicitors at the other ones,' explains Hankey.
The current network is based on a Unisys 6000/60 which runs both CTOS and
Unix. This is located at the headquarters in Norwich and connected to the
outlying offices through dedicated lines leased from British Telecom.
The technology at the outlying offices varies according to the local need.
Some offices have a direct inquiry facility and others go through a TCP/IP
Ethernet network connection. At the smaller offices, where access to the
whole system is unnecessary, there is a single inquiry screen.
Hankey has taken an unusual approach to data capture, which flies in the
face of current thinking. Financial and timekeeping data are never entered
directly into the system by the outlying offices. It is sent to the central
administrative headquarters to be entered by specialist data entry staff.
Hankey says that the main reason is to keep control over the integrity of
the company's data. Transactions are recorded on sheets and faxed across to
the central administration office every afternoon.
Steele's software also has an unusual pedigree. TMA, its software supplier,
acquired the rights to a popular solicitor's application package called
Solacs and used it as the basis of a new package called Comptroller. But
Steele wanted a more flexible version of the software and searched for other
firms of solicitors with a similar need.
'We joined forces with a consortium of five other firms of solicitors and
commissioned TMA to write a replacement. It was quite unusual for a firm of
solicitors to take this sort of initiative.'
The new package, called TMA-Sims, is written using a fourth-generation
language called Progress, which brings particular advantages. The TMA
package provides the standard application, and Progress allows users to
write extra reports.
Hankey says that this is where applications packages have fallen down in the
past: 'You could not have the full range of reports that people want. But it
is very easy to write reports with Progress. They have a feature called
Fasttrack which lets you do programming on a portable computer and then send
it down the line to the main system.'
In addition to the standard administration software the network also
supports other important functions. Terminals have access to office
automation facilities - word processing, spreadsheets and communications -
all supplied as part of the CTOS package.
Steele rents every part of its system - including the software. Hankey says
this brings financial benefits as well as allowing the company to maintain
its technological edge. Carefully-timed upgrades mean that the company is
always running an up-to-date system: 'We are in position where we don't own
the hardware and don't want to. You could argue that after five years in
strict cash terms you have nothing else to pay. But the technology will need
replacing by then anyway.
'The other advantage we have found is that when the rental period expires -
because hardware costs have come down - you are getting a much better
specification of hardware for the same price. Not only that, with
depreciation the value of the rental has gone down.'
A rental agreement also brings other benefits: 'Renting ties the computer
company to you. There is that syndrome where the salesman sells you
something and does not need to come back to you. When you are renting, it is
still their hardware and they have to look after you.
'We rent software too. Arguably it is even more important to rent software
because you have constant upgrades. As an accountant I don't want the
software as a capital asset on the balance sheet,' says Hankey.
He is keen to expand the system and is currently experimenting with the use
of facsimile and telex links so that every terminal in the system can send
messages. There are also plans to make greater use of portable computers so
that solicitors can work on the move and connect into the company network.
Hankey uses a Unisys Powerport portable for his own report writing and to
build small applications in the Progress language: 'We are using Progress to
develop our own reports - which brings some advantages. On the big Unix box
we have a run-time licence. But on the portable we have a full licence. This
means I can develop things on the portable and then push them across to the
Unix box.'
Despite his personal enthusiasm for the technology Hankey is realistic about
its effect on a company and believes that data integrity and trust in the
system is paramount. 'We have auditors from the Law Society, the tax office
and the DSS so the data must be absolutely correct. If there is a single
error the whole system loses credibility.'
But Hankey notes that there is predictable shift in attitudes about a new
computer system when it is introduced: 'There is a very interesting cycle
which occurs when you introduce computer systems. Day one - it is put in
with great expectations and, after a month, people want to know where all of
these fantastic reports are. After six months they still have not got them,
because there is no history in the system.
'After a year, there is total rejection of it. But by the end of 18 months
you can start producing comparative data and the users see information they
have not seen before - fluctuations in work in progress or your debtors'
position. After two years they start to believe that it is right because the
trends which it has shown start to ring true.'
                          *       *      *
BUZZWORDS FOURTH-GENERATION LANGUAGES were devised so that non-technical
computer users could build simple programs. They use plain English to state
a user's requirements, for example 'Print Sales Report'.
                          *       *      *
RUN-TIME LICENCES refer to a type of agreement between software suppliers
and purchasers. Suppliers do not sell software outright, and this licence
gives the purchaser the right to use the package only in its final form. A
full licence give the purchaser rights to develop the package further.

STEELE &amp; CO
COMPANY SNAPSHOT
Steele &amp; Company is one of a new breed of professional organisations which
has based its business expansion plans on significant use of technology.
The geographical spread of its operations in rural East Anglia has made good
communications and careful use of computer systems a necessity.
NATURE OF BUSINESS: The firm operates in all the standard areas of law
including property conveyancing, litigation, probate and commercial work.
TURNOVER: As a professional partnership, Steele &amp; Company does not disclose
financial data.
TECHNOLOGY FILE
SOFTWARE: The main administration and financial work is handled by TMA-Sims,
a specially-developed package for solicitors, running under Unix.  The
office systems software is provided by Unisys's CTOS system and covers
electronic mail, database query, word processing and spreadsheets.
HARDWARE: The main system runs on a Unisys 6000/60 with 1.3 gigabytes of
disk storage for the central database.
Each satellite office is served by a number of Unisys CTOS systems,
operating on a local area network.  These can also act as terminals to the
main system.  The whole system serves 120 screens.
COMMUNICATIONS: The satellite offices are connected to the main computer at
the firm's headquarters, through leased BT lines.
COSTS: Steele rents all software and hardware at a current annual cost of
Pounds 170,000.  Equivalent capital cost of the installation is estimated at
about Pounds 700,000.  Steele also pays an annual Pounds 35,000 maintenance
cost for both software and hardware.

FT  28 MAY 92 / The Cadbury Report: Self-regulation seen as the way forward
 -Industry voices support for code - Shareholders give a mixed reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO assumptions underpin the recommendations of the Cadbury committee,
published yesterday.
One is that self-regulation, rather than statutory enforcement, is the best
route to improving the way companies are run. The second is that financial
markets, rather than external regulators, provide the toughest sanctions
against companies that fail to reach accepted standards of corporate
governance.
Both rely on companies' willingness to comply - and on shareholders'
readiness to shake off their traditional apathy and take a more active
interest in the companies they own. Given past experience, neither can be
taken for granted.
The Cadbury committee was set up in response to a number of corporate
scandals that cast doubt on the systems for controlling the way companies
are run. The downfall of powerful figures such as Asil Nadir or the late
Robert Maxwell, whose personal control over their companies was complete,
raised fears about the concentration of power.
The collapse of companies that only shortly before had received clean audit
reports prompted renewed questioning over the part played by auditors in
reporting to shareholders on their investments. It will be against those
extreme cases that the success of the Cadbury recommendations will be
judged.
The backbone of the proposed system is an annual statement to shareholders
on each company's compliance with a code of conduct, which lays down best
practice for the running of companies. The code is voluntary: the report to
shareholders will not be.
The Stock Exchange - whose chairman, Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, sat on the
committee - is expected to amend its rules for listed companies to require
directors to report each year on whether they have complied with the code,
and to give reasons if they have not. A company's auditors will then report
on the directors' statement, to make sure shareholders are given a true
picture.
'It will be quite easy to see which companies are cocking a snook,' said Mr
Nigel Macdonald, a committee member and vice-chairman of the Institute of
Chartered Accountants of Scotland. 'The market has already rumbled the
flagrant abuses.' The Cadbury recommendations should also flush out the less
obvious cases, he said.
Whatever sanctions are necessary will have to come from the financial
markets. 'If most companies have an audit committee and one or two barons
ignore it, their cost of capital will shoot up,' said Mr Macdonald. 'It's
the reverse of Gresham's Law: good practice should drive out bad.'
Around that central pillar the committee proposes a patchwork of measures
that together would reinforce the system for running companies. The
proposals should be seen as a package, the committee says, the strength of
which depends on all the proposals' being accepted.
Some, however, are unlikely to see the light of day for some time. Four
possible amendments to company law are proposed: to limit directors' service
contracts to three years; to make it easier for auditors to report fraud; to
require directors to report on their systems of internal control; and for
them to state explicitly in the annual accounts that their businesses can
continue as going concerns (the last two should be looked at 'in the light
of experience' of other recommendations in the report).
However, no new companies legislation is planned.
More likely to see the light of day in the short run are proposals that do
not need a change in the law: for example, that the Stock Exchange should
extend the interim reporting requirements for listed companies to include
balance-sheet information and an audit opinion.

FT  28 MAY 92 / The Cadbury Report: Code of practice relies on threat of
public censure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT ITS heart, the Cadbury committee report on the Financial Aspects of
Corporate Governance relies on the threat of public censure to force
companies to improve the way they are governed and to tell shareholders more
about their affairs.
Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of the Financial Reporting Council and a member of
the committee, concedes that the final document, presented as a draft for
public comment, is a consensus view and will fall short of the sort of
reforms that some have been seeking.
The report, for instance, stops short of urging companies to give
shareholders greater say over executive pay. It also does not challenge the
House of Lords' ruling in the Caparo case that auditors have a duty of care
only to a company's management, not to individual shareholders.
Sir Ron said more radical reforms would not be complied with voluntarily and
would therefore require legislation, which would stifle innovation and
enterprise. He said: 'We felt in the end that the best way to go was the
co-operative route encouraged by the Stock Exchange.'
The main body of the report consists of a code of practice that seeks to
force companies to disclose the extent to which they comply with the code
and to explain themselves where they do not. 'Had such a code been in
existence in the past, we believe that a number of the recent examples of
unexpected company failures and cases of fraud would have received attention
earlier and might have been avoided,' the committee says.
The Stock Exchange, which was represented on the committee by Sir Andrew
Hugh Smith, exchange chairman, intends to add a new rule to its 'yellow
book' which will make such disclosure a listing requirement. The rule will
take effect almost immediately and will cover accounts filed for the year
ending December 31 1992 and beyond.
The 19-point code of practice covers four main areas: responsibilities of
boards of directors; the role of executive directors; the role of
non-executives; and accounting controls and reporting mechanisms.
Among its main points are: Corporate boards should have a clearly accepted
division of responsibilities. When the roles of chairman and chief executive
are combined, there should be 'a strong independent element' on the board,
with an appointed leader.
Non-executives should be of a high enough calibre and appointed in
sufficient numbers to give their views weight on a board. The majority of
them should be free of any business or financial connection with the company
and it is advisable that they should not be eligible to participate either
in stock option or employee pension schemes. Their nomination should be
approved by the board as a whole and should be the result of a formal
selection process.
Non-executives should be able to seek financial or legal advice from
professionals outside the company at company expense. The Companies Act
should be amended to reduce the maximum period of a director's service
contract to three years from the present five - a rule that may be
circumvented with shareholder approval.
Directors' pay should be determined by a remuneration committee composed
wholly or mainly of non-executives. The remuneration of the chairman and the
highest-paid director should be fully disclosed and split into their salary
and performance-related-pay elements. The basis upon which
performance-related pay is measured should be explained.
Boards must establish effective audit committees within the next two years,
composed entirely of non-executive directors, a majority of whom are
completely independent of the company.
The audit committee should be able to seek external professional advice and
consult advisers. They should also meet at least annually with the outside
auditors, without any executive board member present.
Fees paid to audit firms for non-audit work conducted worldwide should be
fully disclosed and regulations under the Companies Act should be reviewed
and amended as necessary.
Interim financial statements should include balance sheet information.
Although it is not necessary for interim statements to be audited, they
should be discussed with auditors, and Stock Exchange listing requirements
should be amended to include that requirement.
The accountancy profession is urged to draw up guidelines to guarantee a
periodic change of partners involved in the preparation of any particular
company's audit over a period of years. However, the committee rejected a
proposal to change auditors every few years to prevent relationships between
management and auditors from becoming too comfortable.
Boards should state that it is a reasonable expectation that their company
will continue as a going concern, with supporting assumptions or
qualifications as necessary, and auditors should be required to report on
that statement. The committee has urged the accountancy profession to
develop guidance on the 'going concern' rule. Legislation may be an option
if voluntary compliance appears ineffective.
Although detecting fraud remains the responsibility of boards, the committee
recommends new legislation allowing auditors to report suspicion of fraud to
government authorities without breaching client-confidentiality rules
implied by their contracts. Such laws are already in place for auditors for
banks and other regulated entities.
The committee also lays out what it believes to be the proper role of
shareholders and their relation to boards of directors. In what is likely to
be a disappointment to many institutional shareholders, the report said the
committee considered, but rejected, a formal role for shareholders in the
appointment of directors and auditors.
The report noted that there had been suggestions that shareholders should be
allowed to form committees that would have a say in the drawing up of
director service contracts and the selection of external auditors.
Mr Michael Sandland, chairman of the Institutional Shareholders Committee
and a member of the Cadbury committee, said such committees often did not
work because institutional investors were unwilling to turn over their
proxies to be exercised by someone else. Other shareholder groups, though,
have sought such a mechanism because individual shareholders typically held
too few votes to force management changes.
Instead, the Cadbury committee urges shareholders to back up its
recommendations by 'requiring' companies they invest in to implement the
code.
The report also acknowledges the disparity in power between institutional
and individual shareholders. It stops short of urging any mandatory public
disclosure requirements when significant developments occur, although it
urges companies to ensure that any 'significant' statements concerning their
company are made publicly and are available to all shareholders.
The report also suggests ways to use the annual meeting as a forum for
shareholder concerns. It says: 'If too many annual general meetings are at
present an opportunity missed, this is either because shareholders do not
make the most of them or because boards do not encourage them to do so.'
Possible ways forward include providing forms in annual reports in which
shareholders could send in written questions before the meeting so that
prepared answers could be given at the AGM. After the meeting, the board
could circulate a summary of questions and answers to all shareholders.

FT  28 MAY 92 / The Cadbury Report: Proposals receive boardroom backing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY boardrooms welcomed the Cadbury committee's proposals and said they
were already far advanced in carrying out its main recommendations.
There was general recognition of the need for a greater role for
non-executive directors, and backing for a code of practice widely seen as
having struck the right balance between prescription and the flexibility
required within individual companies.
Most companies believed the code would prove acceptable and had sufficient
teeth to ensure that it was widely implemented. It was hoped that it would
help minimise the prospect of legislation in areas covered by the code.
Mr Graham Mason, director of company affairs at the Confederation of British
Industry, said the committee had put forward practical answers to some of
the key issues of corporate governance. It built on the concept of the
unitary board and the existing means of promoting the accountability of
directors.
Mr Blenyth Jenkins, director of corporate affairs at the Institute of
Directors, said the majority of companies already practised many of the
recommendations but there remained 'a tiny minority which cocks a snook at
good corporate principles and which need to be brought into line'.
He said some companies were finding it increasingly hard to raise capital
because of shareholder concerns about elements of their management policy.
The document provided a clear framework against which they could be judged.
Imperial Chemical Industries was confident that it operated according to
most of the recommendations. Sir Denys Henderson is both chairman and chief
executive but the company has appointed Mr Ronnie Hampel as chief operating
officer.
ICI already provides a breakdown between executive pay and bonuses, and all
members of its audit and remuneration committees are non-executive
directors.
Sir Christopher Hogg, the chairman of two Courtaulds companies and of
Reuters, said the findings would not present difficulties of compliance
within his companies.
He was relieved that it was not a revolutionary document and added: 'There
was a danger it could have gone overboard in proposing new rules and
regulations, making it hard for companies to work in a flexible way. I am
mightily relieved it has not.'
Mr David Prosser, chief executive of Legal and General, said his company, as
an investor, believed in good corporate governance and 'ought to achieve it
in our own house'. Legal and General complies with most of the proposals on
non-executive directors.
Mr Prosser added: 'Our interim report is discussed and reviewed by the
auditors, although it is not fully audited. We do not publish a half-year
balance sheet and do not really think it is necessary for most companies,
but it would not be a problem for us.'
Sir Nicholas Goodison, former Stock Exchange chairman and now chairman of
TSB Group, said: 'I broadly welcome it. I think it is positive and I think
it improves the level of corporate practice.'
He said that since joining TSB he had introduced most of the practices
recommended by Cadbury, particularly relating to non-executive directors.
TSB audit and remuneration committees were entirely composed of
non-executive directors, full details of all directors' salaries were
published, with names, and divisions of responsibility between directors
were made clear.
Sir Patrick Meaney, who holds six non-executive directorships, including the
chairmanship of Rank Organisation, said: 'There is nothing in it so
outrageous or costly to provide sound reasons for rejection. They are par
for the course for any self-respecting company.'
Mr Tony Mitchard, chief executive of Avon Rubber, said the proposals 'made
good sense' and his company, which already complies with some of the
recommendations, would be happy to comply with its findings.
Mr Mitchard said that audited interim statements 'would obviously cost
rather more money by way of audit fees, and it would take a bit more time,
but I do not think it would be too burdensome'.

FT  28 MAY 92 / The Cadbury Report: Labour attacks voluntary approach
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPORT was greeted with some disappointment by Ms Marjorie Mowlam, who
speaks for Labour on corporate affairs, but it was welcomed by ministers.
Ms Mowlam questioned the efficacy of peer group pressure as a way of
enforcing the code of practice and warned that the use of a voluntary code
might amount to a 'recipe for inactivity'.
She said: 'We have had best-practice codes before - from the Association of
British Insurers and from the Institutional Shareholders Committee. I am not
sure they ever go far enough.'
She highlighted areas where she believed the report should have gone
further, commenting on its 'rather vague' reference to companies finding new
ways of working with shareholders. She said that it could have proposed
simplified annual reports or training for shareholders.
A further weakness was the report's comments on the role of non-executive
directors because they did not address where they might be found and whether
they should be trained.
Ms Mowlam also commented that, if the report were serious in addressing the
issue of boardroom pay, it would have recommended that annual meetings
should be able to vote on directors' salaries.
She was disappointed the report did not offer fundamental change, and warned
that as business activity recovered in the 1990s, the same drawbacks would
re-emerge.
'Practical guidelines should have been laid down,' she said.
She welcomed some elements in the document, such as the proposed extension
of statutory protection for auditors reporting reasonable suspicion of
fraud.
Mr Neil Hamilton, the corporate affairs minister, said the report was a
valuable contribution to the debate on improving corporate governance. In
particular, he applauded the idea of a voluntary code of practice, hailing
it as 'an important step forward in improving corporate governance'.
The Department of Trade and Industry emphasised that the report was a draft.
The government would look again at it in the light of the comments it
attracted.

FT  28 MAY 92 / The Cadbury Report: Investors raise only two cheers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OF ALL the interest groups participating in the corporate governance debate,
perhaps no one has more to lose than institutional shareholders.
It is they who suffer when bad management leads to corporate collapse.
Unlike bank creditors, they are on the sidelines when receivers are called
in to divide the remaining assets of a defunct company.
Shareholders give the Cadbury report two cheers. While applauding the
proposed code of practice and its frequent references to the role of
shareholders as owners of companies, they expressed disappointment that, on
several key issues, the report did not go further.
Mr John Rogers, secretary to the investment committee of the National
Association of Pension Funds, whose members manage more than Pounds 300bn in
assets, said it clearly reflected the need to reach a consensus among its
members' conflicting interests.
'However, it's better to have a lower common denominator that everyone can
agree on than to have a higher standard that is ignored,' he said.
Mr Rogers welcomed the proposal for a new Stock Exchange listing requirement
tied to disclosure, saying that some companies might have perfectly valid
reasons for not complying with certain aspects of the code and there was no
reason to compel them to do so. Eventually, though, companies would find
failing to comply with best practice was simply too cumbersome an exercise.
Other shareholders were less optimistic about the effectiveness of the
recommendations. The report's suggestion that shareholders would be able to
require companies in which they invest to comply with the code was dismissed
as improbable.
'If a shareholder sees value in a company, he's unlikely to sell the shares,
no matter what kind of corporate governance it has,' said one institutional
shareholder.
'And you only sell the shares when you think the company is on the way down,
anyway, and you've approached management with your concerns and they tell
you to sod off,' he added.
Some fund managers expressed disappointment that they are not to be given a
greater role in approving what are seen as some of the most contentious
aspects of board policy.
Those include directors' remuneration and selection of external auditors.
Shareholders also expressed disappointment that the committee had not
recommended legislation to make clear that auditors have a duty of care to
shareholders, thus overturning the Caparo decision.
In it, the House of Lords ruled that auditors had a duty of care only to
managements and to shareholders generally - a view that effectively prevents
individual shareholders from seeking restitution from an auditor over a
faulty report.
Shareholders noted that the desire for consensus had clearly forced the
committee to water down some proposals that they had wanted most.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Researchers praise Dutch education
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGHER productivity in the Netherlands than in Britain owes much to the
superiority of Dutch education and training, according to the National
Institute of Economic and Social Research.
In this month's National Institute Review, three researchers emphasise the
relative inferiority of British workers in skill levels.
Comparisons of manufacturing plants found Dutch productivity at least 30 per
cent higher in engineering and more than 15 per cent higher in biscuits.
The researchers highlight three contrasts: higher emergency downtime in
British plants, reflecting poor standards of machine maintenance and
diagnostic skill; greater difficulty in maintaining product quality; and
higher shopfloor manning levels in Britain because of a comparative shortage
of workers able to switch between tasks.
The researchers say Dutch schools place greater emphasis on 'early
systematic preparation for a career'.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Economists predict growth will remain weak: Conservative
election victory fails to brighten forecasts - National Institute says
government expectations may not be met
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and CHRISTOPHER FLOOD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC growth in the UK will continue to crawl along at a weak level for
the rest of this year and next, according to the latest Financial Times
survey of forecasts on the UK economy.
In spite of the Conservative party's election victory in April and a
supposed renewal of confidence, economists have scarcely altered their
growth forecasts since the election.
Economists expect gross domestic product to grow 0.8 per cent this year.
Even next year, GDP growth will not quite recover to the so-called 'trend'
rate of about 2.5 per cent - the level at which the economy is thought to be
able to grow without stretching productive capacity and provoking inflation.
Forecasters project that growth will hover at about 2.4 per cent next year.
The consensus from economists at 22 universities, intergovernmental
institutions, independent think-tanks and City investment houses is that
unemployment will continue to grow over the next two years, rising to 2.75m
by the end of this year and to just under 3m by the end of next. Eight of
the economists surveyed forecast that the number of jobless would reach 3m
next year.
Most are confident that the continued pressure on employment will bring down
average earnings growth to below 7 per cent and reduce unit-wage-cost
inflation.
Projections for output this year are particularly gloomy. The consensus
among the City economists is for output to fall by just less than 1 per
cent. The overall average, at an increase of just under 1 per cent, is only
slightly more cheerful.
Investment is forecast to fall substantially this year but to rebound with
force next year, consensus growth rate of about 4 per cent.
Forecasters do not expect inflation to wither greatly from present levels.
The average forecasts for this year and next, at well over 3 per cent for
both years, are a long way off the Chancellor's desired rate of 2 per cent.
The UK's trade deficit remains a big concern. Nearly all the economists
surveyed predict a worse current-account balance this year than the Pounds
6.5bn deficit projected by the Treasury in the March budget - the consensus
is for a deficit of Pounds 8.4bn - but their forecasts might be too benign
in the light of the most recent current-account data.
Figures for the first four months of this year, released earlier this week,
may be revised substantially in mid June, when more detailed calculations of
the first-quarter 'invisibles' are available.
Goldman Sachs takes the rent-account balance. It predicts a deficit of
Pounds 16.7bn next year, more than twice the size of some of the other
forecasts.
The forecasts for interest rates reflect the continuing constraints of the
UK's membership of the European exchange rate mechanism. The average
forecasts do not suggest that Britain will be able to cut its interest rates
below German rates, although the idea is entertained by some economists.
Mr Giles Keating of Credit Suisse First Boston says: 'I see no problem in UK
interest rates falling below German, although this would be accompanied by
sterling's being a little weaker within the ERM than it is now.'
The gloomiest forecasts come from UBS Phillips and Drew and Professor Wynne
Godley at Cambridge University. Prof Godley is the only economist to
forecast negative GDP growth this year and has the lowest projection for
growth next year. He predicts a PSBR of Pounds 33bn this financial year and
sees unemployment surpassing 3m next year.
UBS sees no growth this year, rising to 1.4 per cent next year.
A much more bullish outlook comes from Mr Michael Knapp at BZW. He forecasts
growth of 1.5 per cent this year and is the only economist to forecast that
unemployment will fall next year.
Mr Richard Jeffrey at Charterhouse Tilney believes that the bottom of the
economic cycle was in the middle of the last year, with a pause before the
election. 'I think the recovery will surprise people by its strength,' he
says.
Since the last FT compilation of forecasts in January, Hoare Govett is no
longer included in the panel and Charterhouse Tilney and Yamaichi have been
added.
The OECD forecast has been included as a memorandum item only because it
dates from last December and is therefore out of date. The OECD secretariat
has prepared a new UK forecast but refuses to release it until the
publication of the next OECD Economic Outlook at the end of June, by which
time it will also be out of date.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Sales optimism reported
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTIMISM about sales among small businesses has risen markedly in the past
three months, according to the latest NatWest Quarterly Survey of Small
Business.
A rise in sales is expected by 20 per cent more small business owners in the
present quarter - April to June - than expect sales to fall. In the previous
survey, 10 per cent more businesses expected sales to fall.
Ms Jane Bradford, head of small-business services, said: 'The position is
better than at any time since early 1991, suggesting the bottom of the cycle
has passed.'
Such optimism contrasted with actual sales performance, with 4 per cent more
businesses reporting lower sales, unchanged on the percentage for the
previous quarter.
Most businesses still expect to reduce employment levels and cut investments
in the present quarter, but the percentages involved are smaller.
On balance, 4 per cent more businesses expect to cut jobs compared with 17
per cent in the previous quarter, while 6 per cent will cut investment
compared with 14 per cent.

FT  28 MAY 92 / EC budget increase is urged for EMU
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community needs a much larger budget to make a success of
economic and monetary union, according to Sir Donald MacDougall, a former
chief economic adviser to the UK government.
Writing in the National Institute Economic Review, Sir Donald said countries
might face 'a prolonged period of painful adjustment, with sluggish or even
negative economic growth' if they did not have Community financial help
after losing the power to vary exchange rates.
Sir Donald, appointed by the EC Commission in the late 1970s to head a
high-level study group on public finance and European integration, said the
lack of a larger budget 'would run the risk of setting back, rather than
promoting, progress towards closer integration in Europe'.
His 1977 report advocated increasing the EC budget from the then 0.7 per
cent of Community GDP to between 2 and 2.5 per cent over a decade.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Edinburgh joins contest for EC bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON, Scottish Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EDINBURGH yesterday pitted itself against Frankfurt, London and Paris, as
well as Amsterdam and Manchester, in formally joining the acrimonious
struggle to become the location of the European Central Bank.
Edinburgh would like the whole of the new institution to come to the city.
It believes its best chance of success, however, lies in persuading the
European Community to disperse departments of the bank around member states,
with Edinburgh becoming the home of an important sector.
Under decisions taken at last year's Maastricht summit to achieve European
monetary union by the end of the century, the bank would operate monetary
policy across the community when the third stage of monetary union starts
either in 1997 or in 1999.
Decisions on siting of the bank should in theory be taken by the end of this
year.
London, Frankfurt and Paris are fighting to be the bank's home, with
Amsterdam seen as a possible compromise candidate. Manchester is the only
other British city to have put its hat into the ring.
Last week Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, raised the hopes of centres
other than London when he told the Commons that he believed 'that Britain -
not London alone but other centres - will be the strongest candidate' to be
the bank's headquarters.
The campaign to bring all or part of the bank to Edinburgh was launched at a
conference in the city attended by some 200 members of its financial
community. A consortium of local authorities and economic development bodies
is spending Pounds 250,000 on the campaign.
Professor Donald MacKay, an economist who heads the economic consultancy
Pieda, said European monetary policy would best be controlled by the bank
from a financial centre where trading took place, which would rule out
Edinburgh - but there was no reason why other functions, such as money
transmission, accounting, research and collation of statistics, could not be
located in Edinburgh. He said the city had considerable expertise in its
financial community and good telecommunications, and was an inexpensive
place to operate.
He believed the bank would employ between 1,500 and 2,000 people in all, of
which between 750 and 1,000 jobs would be in backroom functions of the kind
that Edinburgh could hope to attract.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Council watchdog urges rise in homes for rent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
GOVERNMENT action is needed to remedy the shortfall in affordable housing
for rent, according to a report published today by the Audit Commission.
The local-government watchdog warns that there will be a growing shortfall
in rentable properties at reasonable cost in the next few years.
Ms Sheila McKechnie, director of the housing charity Shelter, said: 'We want
the government to look again at the implications of the projected Pounds 1bn
reduction in local-authority housing resources.'
The Audit Commission's report, she said, 'reinforces Shelter's call for
extra affordable homes as the only way to stop spiralling homelessness'.
The commission says councils could do more to meet the demand for social
housing from their existing resources, but that would still not eliminate
the shortfall.
Its report estimates that an additional 74,000 homes will be needed every
year for the next 10 years to meet the demand.
The commission is also critical of the government's encouragement of
large-scale transfers of council homes to housing associations. It notes
that such transfers have resulted in increased rents and more government
costs in higher housing benefit.
The government has promised housing associations sufficient finance to build
57,000 homes a year by 1994-95. But with local authorities expected to build
only another 5,000 homes a year, there would still be a shortfall.
Sir George Young, the housing minister, said the government supported the
commission's recommendations on measures local authorities could take. He
added that ministers were looking at a range of initiatives to bridge the
housing gap. They included the use of the planning system to increase the
supply of affordable housing, and - through housing associations - reducing
the risks of letting for private landlords.
Sir George did not dispute the Pounds 1bn figure for the reduction in
local-authority housing resources, but pointed to increases in the budget
for the Housing Corporation. 'We don't expect local authorities to build new
family homes for rent,' he said.
The commission says that the gap could be partly closed if local authorities
made better use of their existing housing stock. It suggests that:
Gaps between lettings are still unnecessarily long. Achieving the
commission's target of three weeks (six weeks in London) would create 26,000
extra lettings and generate additional rents.
Reducing the growing number of unlicensed tenancies would provide 7,000 new
homes (mostly in London).
Many councils fail to use their full entitlement to nominate tenants to
registered housing associations. Councils could do more to encourage people
to move into more suitable council homes - perhaps by increasing rent
differentials so that people in unnecessarily large homes were encouraged to
move.
The report estimates that the backlog of maintenance and repairs to
local-authority housing stock has fallen to about Pounds 8.5bn (down from
Pounds 11bn in 1985). While the number of homes in the private sector
lacking basic amenities has continued to fall, the level of homes in serious
disrepair or unfit is stable.

FOURTEEN resort and rural beaches failed to meet the environmental and
safety standards laid down in new seaside awards announced yesterday by the
Tidy Britain Group, a national agency for anti-litter issues.
A total of 43 resort beaches were up to standard and received an award, and
14 received a premier award for good water quality. Six resort beaches -
Thorpe Bay, Sutton on Sea, Hill Head, Littlehampton, Exmouth and Goodrington
South Sands - failed.
On Littlehampton, the judges spoke of 'the large quantity of sewage-related
debris present on the beach'.
The resort beach premier winners included: Bridlington North; Mablethorpe;
Skegness; Sheerness Beach Street: Crinnis; Weymouth; and Woolacombe.
Fifty rural beaches passed, 22 receiving premier awards, and eight failed.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Ford to sell stake in AC Cars
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FORD is to sell its stake in AC Cars, the Surrey-based specialist sports car
company in which it took a 50.96 per cent stake for Pounds 1.3m nearly five
years ago.
The holding is being sold, for an undisclosed sum, to Mr Brian Angliss, AC
Cars' managing director. He also controls Autokraft, a private company which
holds the minority stake in AC Cars.
Ford yesterday gave no explanation for its decision to return the holding,
but said it would continue to assist AC Cars with the supply of engines and
components for the AC Ace, a sports car under development for some time.
Mr Angliss said last night that the sale had been agreed amicably. That is
despite a long-standing apparent clash of cultures which led Ford in 1990 to
seek the winding-up of AC Cars. The application is only now being withdrawn.
Mr Angliss intends to seek a new partner to put the AC Ace into commercial
production at volumes of 500-600 a year.
AC, formed in 1901, is one of the oldest carmakers still in existence. It
was attractive to Ford partly because it originally made the Cobra, a
powerful Ford-engined sports car of the 1960s which became something of a
legend. Ford will retain the right to the Cobra name in North America.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Reform of pensions law urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A THOROUGH overhaul of the legal basis for the UK's 400,000 occupational
pension schemes was called for yesterday by the chairman of the Investment
Management Regulatory Organisation, one of the City's investment regulators.
The comments of Mr George Nissen in a speech to a London conference appeared
to have been prompted by the plight of Maxwell pensioners, although he did
not mention the late Mr Robert Maxwell by name.
'There has never been an attempt to establish an occupational pension scheme
system set in a sound, purpose-built legislative framework,' Mr Nissen said.
Referring to a parliamentary investigation of the handling of pension and
other trusts nearly a century ago, he said: 'The problems that existed in
1895 are still with us today.
'The existing system should be reviewed and the results of that review used
in establishing a sound . . . system on a firm legislative foundation.'
Mr Nissen also complained that responsibility for the running of pension
schemes was spread between too many agencies. 'The number of agencies and
professionals involved in the administration is so great and their
responsibilities so unclear that cracks were almost bound to develop,' he
said.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Berry aims to sue Manpower for Pounds 1/2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FORMER chairman of Blue Arrow is to sue the company for about Pounds
500,000 in connection with his legal fees for the two Department of Trade
and Industry inquiries into its activities, John Mason writes.
The move by Mr Tony Berry follows the issuing of a writ in the High Court by
City law firm D. J. Freeman. The firm, which acted for Mr Berry during the
inquiries into the 1987 Blue Arrow rights issue, is claiming Pounds 234,817
in unpaid fees. Mr Berry will contest the action and also sue his old
company, which has been renamed Manpower, for his total legal costs.
Mr Berry says he has paid Freeman approximately Pounds 300,000. The money
sought by Freeman is a balancing item. Although indemnified by Manpower for
the DTI inquiries as a condition of his resignation in 1989, Mr Berry says
he has yet to be reimbursed for any of the legal fees incurred.
Mr Mitchell Fromstein, Manpower's chairman, said the company's decision on
how much and when to pay Mr Berry depended on the outcome of the still
unpublished second report. He believed the company had met Mr Berry's legal
fees from the first inquiry.

A GLIMPSE of the behind-the-scenes disputes in Mr Neil Kinnock's shadow
cabinet emerged last night as the three candidates for Labour's deputy
leadership debated the party's future, Ivo Dawnay writes.
Mrs Beckett, Mr Gould and Mr Prescott all admitted that they had expressed
serious reservations over the leadership's unwillingness to adopt sharp cuts
in defence expenditure.
In the three-way debate organised by the Fabian Society, they disagreed over
how the leadership had responded to the UK's membership of the European
exchange rate mechanism and the longer-term goal of monetary union.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Gould refuses to concede fight for Labour leadership
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Bryan Gould, a candidate for the leadership and deputy leadership of the
Labour party, insisted yesterday that he would not concede the contest to
take over from Mr Neil Kinnock, even though he admitted that there was a
danger of 'falling between two stools' in running for both posts.
In a press conference to launch 'An Agenda for Change', as part of his
rolling manifesto, Mr Gould criticised as 'somewhat undemocratic' claims
from Mr John Smith's camp suggesting that the leadership contest was already
over.
Mr Smith's standing among the constituency parties was, he said, 'a matter
of conjecture'. He warned that it was 'slightly disturbing' for Mr Robin
Cook, Mr Smith's campaign manager, to claim that Mr Smith already had
majority support in the contest when voting will not take place until mid
July.
Mr Gould said that the contest for the deputy leadership was more difficult
to read than that for the top job. However, the perception seemed to be that
Mrs Margaret Beckett was losing ground among Labour MPs and constituency
parties, and might finish in third place. He was confident that he would win
in a final ballot against Mrs Beckett or Mr John Prescott.
Acknowledging that some people would not wish to vote for him for both
posts, Mr Gould urged those who wanted him to be leader to carry that view
through to the deputy leadership election as well. 'The real question is: do
they want me in a leadership team?' he said yesterday.
The paper launched by Mr Gould yesterday raised questions about the future
of the party and what issues it should address. It warned that Labour was
suffering from 'an identity crisis'.
He pressed more strongly than before the need to move to a tax-benefit
system as a way both of keeping the universality of benefits without
extending means-testing or devoting too much to those who did not need it.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Generators make coal offers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor and JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ELECTRICITY generators have made their opening offers in negotiations with
British Coal for long-term supply contracts based on world prices.
According to Coal UK, an industry newsletter, National Power and PowerGen
have made offers well below British Coal's present price of Pounds 1.85 a
gigajoule. National Power, the larger of the two, is believed to have
offered Pounds 1.50, and PowerGen Pounds 1.10. PowerGen's lower price
reflects its lesser dependence on supplies from British Coal.
The contracts will run for five years from next April. The present contracts
are based on artificially high prices intended to help the coal industry.
Although the central element of the negotiations is over the amount of coal
to be taken by the generators, the price will have a strong bearing on the
amounts, as well as on British Coal's ability to compete with new gas-fired
generating capacity.
The generators are determined to bring UK coal prices down closer to world
levels, but British Coal needs prices that will make it a viable business
after privatisation, due later this year.
National Power yesterday declined to comment on details of the negotiations.
It said the talks were aimed at satisfying the distribution companies'
requirements for realistically priced power and British Coal's interest in
suitable prices, quantities and contract lengths.
Juliet Sychrava writes: Large industrial consumers in the UK faced the
highest electricity price increases for seven years in the 12 months to
April, according to a survey of 1,200 companies by National Utility
Services.
Large electricity consumers pay 4.28p a unit, the survey found, compared
with 3.94p last year. That is cheaper than Italy, Germany, Belgium, and
Eire, but more expensive than the US, France, Netherlands, Finland, Norway,
Sweden, Australia and Canada.
The survey warned that prices might rise further if more competition in
electricity generation did not emerge and it supports large consumers'
claims that they have not benefited from electricity privatisation.
Those consumers, represented by the Major Energy Users Council, have been
lobbying the government to intervene in the new electricity market created
at privatisation. The users council says the market gives too much power to
National Power and PowerGen to push prices up.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Obituary of Peter Jenkins: Leading political journalist
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PETER Jenkins, who died yesterday at the age of 58, was one of the most
accomplished British political journalists and one who was equally at home
writing about foreign affairs.
Although he spent the last five years as associate editor and political
columnist at The Independent, and was initiated into national journalism by
two years at the Financial Times, it is probably for his long spell at The
Guardian that he will be most remembered.
Jenkins made his breakthrough at The Guardian as labour correspondent during
the first years of Harold Wilson's premiership - a time when industrial
disputes and trade union law topped the political agenda. He went on to
become the paper's Washington columnist.
When he returned to London as political commentator and policy editor in
1974, he watched the decline of the Labour party and the rise of
Thatcherism. The latter did not attract him and he was saddened by the
Labour government's failure to tame the excesses of the unions.
Jenkins's political sympathies were with the Social Democrats and he
recorded with pleasure the emergence of the SDP in 1981. He saw himself as
part of the political process, helping the politicians and the public to
communicate with each other. His book, Mrs Thatcher's Revolution, published
in 1987, concluded that it was only 'half a revolution', which perhaps seems
a more accurate judgment now than it did then.
Jenkins moved briefly to The Sunday Times in 1985, but the paper's style did
not suit him and he settled at The Independent two years later. Some of his
best columns appeared only recently, when he assessed the current state of
Germany, a country he had always followed closely. He was a member of the
Konigswinter conference, which fosters Anglo-German relations.
Outside politics and journalism, one of his chief interests was theatre.
Jenkins had one child with his first wife, Charlotte. In 1970 he married the
journalist Polly Toynbee, with whom he had three children.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Obituary of Lord McFadzean: Free marketeer
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
LORD McFadzean of Kelvinside, who has died aged 76, was chairman in
succession of Shell, British Airways and Rolls-Royce in the 1970s and 1980s.
An outspoken, stocky Scot, he combined a career as an industrialist with an
intellectual commitment to free-market economics. As a visiting professor of
economics at Strathclyde University from 1967 to 1976 he attacked the
theories of John Kenneth Galbraith.
When Margaret Thatcher came to power in 1979 he described her as 'the most
intelligent person I have ever met'.
He was born in Glasgow on November 26 1915 and ran away to sea at the age of
14, returning a year later. He trained as an economist, gaining a
first-class degree at Glasgow University, then studying at the London School
of Economics.
In 1938 he joined the Board of Trade and moved quickly on to the Treasury.
After the Second World War he worked for the Malayan government and the
Colonial Development Corporation.
At 36, McFadzean entered the private sector with Shell. Within nine years,
his uncompromising approach to efficiency earned him a place on the board
and his outspokenness the sobriquet 'Fearless Frank'. In 1972 he became
chairman of Shell.
In 1976 he was one of the few industrialists prepared to take on the running
of the then state-owned British Airways. He instituted job cuts and clashed
with the unions. Sir Keith Joseph asked him to write a pamphlet which was
published under the title The Economics of John Kenneth Galbraith: a Study
in Fantasy.
After the 1979 Conservative victory, he moved to Rolls-Royce, which he led
through the recession of 1981-83, shedding 20,000 jobs and turning a Pounds
22m loss in 1980 into an Pounds 18m profit in 1981.
He was chairman of the Trade Policy Research Centre from 1971 until 1982. He
was knighted in 1975 and created a life peer as Baron McFadzean of
Kelvinside in 1980.
He married Isabel Beattie in 1938. Their daughter, Felicity, married Baron
Marsh, the former Labour transport minister. Isabel died in 1987 and he
married Sonja Khung in 1988.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Pay offer of 3.8% for council staff
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOCAL GOVERNMENT white-collar workers may receive one of the lowest pay
settlements in the public sector this year after employers yesterday offered
a 3.8 per cent rise in basic pay.
The offer, up from a previous 3.6 per cent, was dismissed by Nalgo, the main
union in the negotiations, as unrealistically low. Mr Dennis Reed, Nalgo
local-government officer, said he hoped for a negotiated settlement but
added that industrial action was possible.
The talks cover about 750,000 workers and set the tone for negotiations for
1m manual workers in local government who traditionally receive a similar
rise.
The offer compares with proposed settlements for the majority of Britain's
civil servants of between 4.5 per cent and 4.75 per cent including
performance-related pay provisions. Some health workers have been offered
more.
Council associations are to consult authorities on their opinions on a
settlement. However, Mr Steve Bubb, assistant secretary at the Association
of Metropolitan Authorities, said there would be no dramatic movement.
The revenue support grant allowance for inflation was 4.8 per cent but
authorities argue that there is less than that available for white-collar
workers. That is in part because of a 7.5 per cent rise for teachers which
was determined by a pay review body.

FT  28 MAY 92 / UN report warns on global heating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON, Science Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE political drive to combat global warming receives powerful scientific
backing today with the publication of a report from the United Nations
inter-governmental panel on climate change (IPCC) to next week's Earth
Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
IPCC predicts that human activities will heat up the world during the next
century, by pumping carbon dioxide and other 'greenhouse gases' into the
atmosphere.
There is, however, still uncertainty about the scientific processes involved
in global warming. It is also impossible to know how much the world
population and industrial activities will grow, and how much greenhouse
emissions will be reduced by concerted international action to reduce
consumption of carbon fuels.
IPCC studied six scenarios and each shows an appreciable increase in global
temperature. The average increase is likely to be somewhere between 1.5
degrees Celsius and 3.5 degrees Celsius over the next 100 years. Even
warming at the bottom end of this range could raise sea levels by 50cm -
enough to flood low-lying countries such as Bangladesh. Agriculture in some
parts of the world would be devastated.
The report draws directly on the research of 118 scientists from 22
countries; a further 380 scientists were brought in to review their work.
'It can therefore be considered as an authoritative statement of the
contemporary scientific community,' said Sir John Houghton, scientific
chairman of IPCC and former director of the UK Meteorological Office.
Today's report stands by the main conclusions of the IPCC's first scientific
assessment, released in 1990, which shocked politicians and gave real
momentum to the movement to draw up an international convention on climatic
change.
There has been a vast amount of research since then - some suggesting the
IPCC had exaggerated the danger by ignoring cooling processes which could
counteract the greenhouse effect. But IPCC says these will only slightly
reduce the overall trend.
The most important new cooling influences are destruction of the
heat-absorbing ozone layer by man-made chemicals (mainly CFCs), and tiny
particles of industrial pollution known as 'sulphate aerosols' which shroud
much of the northern hemisphere in a heat-reflecting haze.

<TEXT>
MR Pedro Collor, the younger brother of Brazil's President Fernando Collor,
yesterday produced the results of medical tests confirming his own sanity
and accused the president's campaign treasurer of attempting to bribe him
with Dollars 25m (Pounds 14.1m) to leave the country.
Mr Pedro Collor took the tests to lend credibility to claims against the
president and his campaign treasurer, Mr Paulo Cesar Farias. Details are on
a videotape which Mr Pedro Collor says could bring down the government.
Insisting that 'all I have said in earlier interviews is true,' Mr Pedro
Collor admitted yesterday for the first time that he had no proof against
his presidential brother. However, he repeated his allegations of extortion
against Mr Farias (known as PC), whom he said had tried to influence his
brother. He alleged: 'PC tried to bribe me with Dollars 25m through a mutual
friend to leave the country until 1995 (when Mr Collor's term ends)'.
The Brazilian stock markets immediately rose on Mr Pedro Collor's admission
of lack of evidence against the president and by the end of the day the main
Sao Paulo index had gained 7.5 per cent.
However, problems are far from over for the president, who is due to open
the Earth Summit next week. In the early hours of yesterday morning the
Brazilian Congress approved a parliamentary inquiry into Mr Pedro Collor's
allegations.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bush Administration is preparing again to fend off Congressional
attempts to place conditions on the favourable trade treatment accorded to
Chinese exports, Nancy Dunne reports from Washington.
Last year, the president was forced to veto legislation putting conditions
on China's Most Favoured Nation (MFN) status, which gives it lower tariffs
than those still applied to the former Soviet Union. The veto was sustained
in the Senate earlier this year, but only by seven votes.
One of the president's key supporters on the issue, Democratic Senator Max
Baucus, is now threatening to withdraw his support. The senator is
frustrated by the administration's failure to include environmental
programmes and a worker's adjustment assistance scheme in the North American
Free Trade Agreement (Nafta).
Senator Baucus, who heads the Senate's international trade subcommittee, is
one of the most influential voices on trade in the Congress. He supported
the administration both on China and renewal of fast-track negotiating
authority for the Nafta, but warned that he would reject the latter without
strong environmental and labour provisions. The president has until June 3
to notify Congress of his intention to extend China's MFN. Congress could
then vote it down, but total rejection is unlikely.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN grain exports to Russia have slowed to a trickle because of
Moscow's inability to pay foreign shipowners and a ban imposed by Ottawa on
many Russian-owned vessels to counter an infestation of leaf-eating moths.
Russia's shortage of hard currency has already caused Canadian authorities
to impound at least one fully-laden vessel, and appears to be discouraging
other owners from sending ships to Canadian ports.
The slowdown in shipments to Canada's biggest grain export market has also
caused a domestic transport crisis. About half the grain freighters plying
the Great Lakes are at present idle.
Estimates of June exports were cut yesterday. Total shipments through the
Great Lakes port of Thunder Bay are now projected at 0.5m tonnes, half the
volume expected a month ago.

the details of the proposals, nor would she characterise the EC reaction to
the terms beyond an initial commitment to review them.
But they were designed, she said, 'to bridge the gap' between reform of the
CAP and the terms of the draft Uruguay Round trade agreement drawn up by Mr
Arthur Dunkel, director-general of the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade (Gatt).
She said the EC team, led by Mr Frans Andriessen, trade commissioner, had
made clear its belief that last week's CAP reform opened the way for a
Uruguay Round breakthrough. She implied there was still a gap between the
new CAP changes to internal EC market supports and continuing distorting
effects on international trade that are a central concern of the Dunkel
draft.
However, she described yesterday's exchanges variously as 'good' and
'creative.' She was joined in the talks by Mr James Baker, US secretary of
state, and Mr Edward Madigan, secretary of agriculture.
Meanwhile, the American Farm Bureau, whose support is considered vital for a
Gatt deal to go through Congress, has responded bitterly to EC officials'
suggestions that the US should make further concessions in Gatt.
'The EC reforms fall far short of the proposed agricultural agreement put
forward by Arthur Dunkel and further short of what the Bureau would expect
to achieve in the talks,' Mr Dean Kleckner, the body's president, said.
A spokesman for Cargill, the international grain trader, said the company
was still assessing the CAP reform proposals. But a favourable review of the
deal had been received from its European office.

</HEADLINE>

THE US government is to conduct a high-level inter-agency review of the
implementation of last year's agreement with Japan on semiconductor trade, a
move signalling growing concern in the US about lack of progress on
improving foreign access to the Japanese chip market.
'We are extremely troubled by the lack of progress,' Mrs Carla Hills, US
trade representative, said when announcing the review yesterday. 'A detailed
examination of the facts will help to determine whether the arrangement is
being implemented properly, and what must be done to overcome any
impediments to market access.'
Under the terms of the 1991 agreement Japan recognised US expectations that
the foreign share of the Japanese semiconductor market should rise to more
than 20 per cent by the end of 1992. However, according to the last
available data, the foreign share stood at only 14.4 per cent in the fourth
quarter of 1991, and has been virtually stagnant for the past two years.
Official figures for market share in the first quarter of 1992 are not
expected until mid-June, but unofficial measures from industry sources
suggest that Japanese imports of most types of semiconductor products have
declined sharply over the past few months, reflecting weakening economic
conditions in Japan.
The announcement of the inter-agency review 'is one more indication that
Japan must take immediate steps to improve access to its semiconductor
market,' Mr Andrew Procassini, president of the US Semiconductor Industry
Association, said. 'It also sends a strong message that the US government
will insist Japan adhere to the terms of the agreement.'
The inter-agency review - drawing in the Trade Representative's Office, the
Commerce and State departments, and several other bodies - will begin this
week and is expected to file a report by August 1.

TURKEY and Russia have agreed terms for settling an outstanding debt owed by
Moscow, paving the way for a new gas trade accord, worth Dollars 290m
(Pounds 163.8m) in 1991, John Murray Brown reports from Ankara.
Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkish prime minister, has won assurance from Mr Yegor
Gaidar, Russia's first deputy prime minister, that Russia would repay a
Dollars 35m debt over the next three months.
Russia has also agreed a Turkish request that proceeds of the gas trade be
paid into the Turkish Eximbank in Ankara, rather than the Vnesheconombank,
the bank through which former Soviet foreign debt is paid.
Under the deal Russia assumes contractual responsibility for the natural gas
contract first agreed with the former Soviet Union in 1984. However, the two
sides have still to finalise details on changes on both the price and volume
of the gas shipped.

FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Chip makers' protection spells buyers'
burden - EC officials seeking tariff cuts are caught in the middle of a
bitter debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE officials in Brussels negotiating with the rest of the world to reduce
tariffs are finding themselves in the middle of a bitter debate between
Europe's semiconductor makers and its users - and both sides claim the
outcome could make or break Europe's electronics industry.
During the current round of multilateral talks on the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, the EC has offered to lower import tariffs on various
goods by 30 per cent. This offer would apply to the existing 14 per cent
import duty on semiconductors. Whether EC negotiators will keep the offer on
the table depends on how the talks go.
After years of struggling to hold their own, European semiconductor
manufacturers believe a tariff reduction is certain to accelerate the steady
fall in their share of the European market.
Even with the tariff in effect, that share has fallen from 45 per cent in
1978 to about 39 per cent in 1990 and 38 per cent last year, according to
Dataquest, the high-technology consultancy.
US manufacturers together control about 42 per cent of the European market,
while Far Eastern manufacturers have increased their share steadily.
A tariff reduction would be 'one more step towards a very bad situation and
eventually to the industry disappearing altogether', says Mr Klaus
Brinkmann, chairman of the semiconductor working group of the European
Electronic Components Association.
He argues that the semiconductor industry is a key industry on which all
other industries depend. 'Without semiconductors Europe has no industrial
future,' says Mr Brinkmann.
The EC has been the last remaining economy with a tariff on semiconductors
after the US, Japan and Canada suspended their tariffs in 1985.
The elimination of tariffs on semiconductors in Europe 'is among the top
priorities for the Gatt round,' says the Semiconductor Industry Association,
the trade body in the US.
At the same time semiconductor users in Europe are fighting just as
vehemently for the tariff's removal. Either the tariff, which protects
semiconductor manufacturers at the expense of equipment manufacturers, goes
or equipment manufacturers themselves will have to leave Europe, they say.
Olivetti, the Italian computer and office equipment group, for example, has
already moved production of some low-end PCs to Singapore and could move
more production there, according to Mr Bruno Lamborghini, head of Olivetti's
EC liaison office. 'We cannot wait too long,' he says. 'We have to take a
decision.'
'We need zero tariffs,' he says. 'I don't see why we have to support an
industry that cannot compete.'
The semiconductor industry has always claimed that the high costs of
manufacturing in Europe - over 20 per cent more than in the US or Japan - is
due to high labour and capital costs which they have no control over. A
tariff is needed to create a 'level playing field' with their competitors.
Semiconductor users in Europe, in particular the information technology and
telecommunications manufacturers, counter that they are faced with the same
high costs of manufacturing in Europe.
Eurobit, the association of European business machine manufacturers and the
information technology industry, points out that the semiconductor tariff
places the equipment manufacturers at a disadvantage since the level of
tariffs on imported electronic equipment - generally between 4 and 7 per
cent - is lower than the tariff on semiconductors.
This means, in effect, that equipment manufacturers carry the cost of the
higher level of protection provided to the semiconductor industry.
'To create an artificial market is to spell death for the electronics
industry,' Mr Lamborghini says.
He suggests that European semiconductor manufacturers stop trying to compete
in areas where they clearly are not competitive and concentrate their
efforts on areas where they have strength, such as custom chips. If they are
really competitive in these areas they will be able to hold their own even
without the protective tariff.
Both the US and Japan are seeking suspension of the 14 per cent tariff. The
SIA warns that some form of retaliation is not ruled out entirely.
'Depending on what comes out of the Gatt talks, anything is possible.'
The EECA admits that the timing constraints of the Uruguay Round means that
the EC is unlikely to be able to make an exception for the semiconductor
industry.
The options the industry is left with are to continue pushing for an
integrated EC policy on electronics while seeking better access to export
markets such as Japan. But most important, perhaps, it needs to shape up to
meet the impending reality of a less cosy home market.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Brittan warns carmakers on prices: European Commission
report reveals variations of up to 40 per cent
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN DONE, Motor Industry Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Leon Brittan, the European Community competition commissioner, has
warned car makers that action is needed to reduce price differentials
between different European markets.
In a letter to car makers he has warned that the Commission has decided that
'action is needed at once' both to monitor car prices more closely and to
reduce differentials.
A controversial study prepared for the European Commission and published
earlier this month shows that there have been substantial price differences
for some car models across the Community of more than 40 per cent in the
most extreme cases.
According to the EC report five car makers, Ford, Honda, Citroen, Mazda and
Audi, had at least one model with price differences greater than 40 per cent
in one of the five time periods selected for study between January 1988 and
January 1991.
The study's findings have come under heavy attack from car makers, but in
his letter Sir Leon has made clear that car makers must take steps to make
there European pricing policies more transparent, if they wish to retain the
present selective car dealer distribution system in Europe.
The system is allowed under a 10-year exemption from EC competition
regulations, which is due to expire in 1995. Its future would be decided
after a review of the system 'as it currently operates, and not just the
price issue', Sir Leon said.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Ripa di Meanawill not attend Earth Summit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   BRUSSELS, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission is refusing to send its environment commissioner to
the Earth Summit in Brazil next week because of the failure of world leaders
to agree to binding commitments to reduce global pollution.
Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana said yesterday he would not go to a meeting 'where
everything has been fixed in advance' and which would just produce 'words,
rather than binding obligations and precise understandings' on how to cut
carbon emissions. Brussels will send the director-general of its environment
service instead.
Mr Ripa di Meana's absence from the Rio summit is a further sign of the
disarray among the industrial countries and it will further reduce popular
expectations about the outcome. However, Mr Ripa di Meana's views appear not
to be widely shared among EC governments, whose top representatives will
attend.
It was the prospect of non-binding treaties emerging from the summit that
eventually persuaded President George Bush to attend. He had made clear he
was unwilling to commit the US to specific targets.
Like the US president, Mr Ripa di Meana had tried to use doubts over his
presence in Rio as leverage. Greenpeace, the environmental lobby, yesterday
said his boycott exposed the 'hypocrisy of Mr Bush and others who are going
along to the meeting pretending everything is fine'.
Mr Ripa di Meana's protest action was largely directed at EC environment
ministers, who failed in Brussels on Tuesday to do more than 'note' the
Commission's plans for a carbon tax and specific energy-saving measures.
He was particularly irritated at being criticised by northern 'green'
countries for making the EC carbon tax plan conditional on similar US and
Japanese action.
Mr Ripa di Meana's move came as a UN panel of scientific experts reaffirmed
earlier warnings about the dangers of global warming ahead of the Rio
gathering. The Inter-governmental Panel on Climate Change predicted that
emissions of greenhouse gases could push up the world temperature between
1.5 and 3.5 degrees over the next 100 years.

<TEXT>
THE 12 European Community countries yesterday agreed to impose a trade
embargo on Serbia and are asking the United Nations to impose similar
sanctions as well as an oil and financial embargo.
The EC move coincided with new bloodshed in Sarajevo, besieged capital of
the breakaway Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Shells fired from Serb militia positions in hills above the city killed 16
people and wounded 110 as they queued for bread. Ms Envera Selimovic, a
journalist for Bosnian radio, said: 'It was horrible, unimaginable. There
were people lying wounded and missing arms and legs. The street was a river
of blood.'
Bosnian leaders later called on citizens to rise up in defence of the
republic, and Belgrade radio and TV last night reported Moslem attacks on
Serb-dominated federal forces at their barracks and at the airport in
Sarajevo.
The sanctions agreement in Brussels was milder than sought by Mr John Major,
who was in Prague on a central European tour. The prime minister wanted an
even tougher EC line against Serbia in protest at Belgrade's failure to stop
Serbian attacks in Bosnia.
British officials said, however, that after the Sarajevo shelling, EC
countries resolved to put the issue of an oil embargo and an assets freeze
on the UN agenda.
EC ambassadors in Brussels agreed to freeze arrangements for national export
credits and scientific co-operation with Serbia and its ally, Montenegro.
The ambassadors agreed to ask the UN Security Council to adopt a similar
trade embargo to the EC and to examine the possibility of a UN-sanctioned
oil embargo. They also proposed a UN freeze on Serbian and Montenegrin
assets abroad, as well as a UN ban on financial transactions with Serbia and
Montenegro.
France initially resisted a call for an oil embargo and successfully argued
that Community sanctions should not extend to air links, because these might
be useful for humanitarian aid.
In New York, Security Council delegates said they expected a UN sanctions
decision within days.
Sir David Hannay, the British delegate, declined to disclose details of a
possible resolution except to say that an oil embargo was 'obviously one of
the measures under consideration'.
He seemed to imply that oil might be excluded initially when he added that
sanctions could be adopted in two stages.
Other diplomats said the UN was not likely to impose an oil embargo
immediately as Russia and China were hesitating.
UN sources said civil aviation, trade and possibly sports contacts would be
the first areas to be covered under the terms of chapter Vll of the Union
charter, which would make them mandatory on all UN member states.
The EC trade embargo applies to all goods except oil. Services such as air
transport are also excluded. Germany and Italy have already denied landing
rights to JAT, the Belgrade-based airline.
UEFA, the governing body of European football, is expected to drop
Yugoslavia from next month's European championship competition, AP reports
from Stockholm.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Labour moves to end union role
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour leadership agreed yesterday to call on its policymaking annual
conference to end the trade unions' role in the selection of parliamentary
candidates.
But Mr Neil Kinnock, who had proposed the changeover to a simple one member,
one vote system, used his first interviews since the general election to
insist that there was no question of severing the unions' historic links
with the party.
Without union support for Labour the Conservatives would have had 'a near
monopoly' of the press, political funding and power, the party leader told
the national executive committee. 'I don't believe there is anyone in
Britain who believes that British democracy would have been best served in
that fashion,' he said. His warning came as officials confirmed that
individual membership of the party had fallen to 260,000 from 320,000 in
1990.
This is the lowest figure for 60 years and another compelling reason for
maintaining union financial support.
NEC members voted by 20 to 2 against to support the rule change with just Mr
Tony Benn and Mr Dennis Skinner, the veteran leftwingers dissenting.
By a similar margin, they went on to approve a proposal for Mr Larry Whitty,
the general secretary, to hold consultations on a wide ranging review of the
party's relationship with the unions, reporting back to the executive next
month.
That proposal, tabled by Mr Tom Sawyer, an NEC member and deputy general
secretary of the public service union NUPE, comes as a deliberate effort to
calm the debate on the link that has raged since criticism of union
influence surfaced with the party's leadership election. Union leaders, who
provide the overwhelming bulk of Labour's funding, have been growing
increasingly angry at the attacks.
Mr Whitty will now seek opinions on how to review the unions' role in the
leadership election - currently they command 40 per cent of the electoral
college - their affiliation fees and representation on the national
executive and the soon to be established national policy forum.
Also high on the agenda will be the controversial block vote at conference,
whereby union delegations control some 90 per cent of the votes. At
Blackpool this autumn, delegates will vote on a proposal to reduce the union
weighting against the constituency parties to 70-30.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Cadbury lays out new rules for directors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, MICHAEL CASSELL and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MANAGEMENTS of British companies would have to defer more decisions to
non-executive directors and give more information to shareholders under
proposals unveiled yesterday after a far-reaching review of corporate
governance.
The Committee on Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance was chaired by
Sir Adrian Cadbury, head of ProNed, an organisation which promotes the role
of non-executive directors, and former chairman of Cadbury Schweppes.
The proposed reforms are almost entirely voluntary. The Cadbury committee,
however, proposed that they be given immediate force through a new listing
requirement to be adopted by the London Stock Exchange.
This would require companies, beginning with their 1992 accounts, to
disclose the extent to which they comply with the recommendations and to
explain non-compliance where it occurs.
Sir Ron Dearing, a member of the Cadbury committee and chairman of the
Financial Reporting Council, the UK umbrella organisation for accountancy
bodies, said yesterday the group might urge that some of its recommendations
be made statutory if companies did not adopt the voluntary code.
'If two years on there has been massive non-compliance, then we may have to
consider new regulations,' Sir Ron said. A monitoring committee will be
established to review compliance. 'If companies do not back our proposal we
believe that there will be increasing pressure for legislation and external
regulation which will be less effective than the approach we recommend,' he
said.
At the heart of the recommendations is a code of practice for boards of
directors covering matters ranging from the structure of remuneration and
audit committees and disclosure of performance-related pay to the role of
directors in preparing annual accounts.
Many companies yesterday welcomed the report as a well-balanced attempt to
promote higher standards of boardroom accountability and to ensure that
effective self-regulation precluded the need for legislation.
Most of the larger companies claimed that they were well on the way to
implementing the main recommendations. The Confederation of British Industry
said the report had tried to strike a balance between prescription and the
flexibility needed for the wide range of businesses invited to adopt the
code of practice.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, said the report complemented
and reinforced initiatives the government had already taken to improve
financial reporting.
But Ms Marjorie Mowlam, Labour's corporate affairs spokesman, condemned its
'lack of teeth', warning that a voluntary code might amount to a 'recipe for
inactivity'.
Sir Ron conceded that elements of the report fell short of what had been
sought by many institutional shareholders. However, he said the committee
believed it was crucial to make proposals that all parties could agree on in
order to ensure compliance. Stronger measures might never have obtained the
backing of corporate boards, he said.
Among the report's key recommendations are:
Board authority should be divided between chairman and chief executive;
board structures combining the two roles should ensure the presence of a
strong independent element with an appointed leader.
The split between salary and performance-related pay, and basis for the
latter, of the chairman and the highest paid UK director should be disclosed
in annual accounts.
Each board should have an audit and remuneration committee, with the audit
committee to be composed wholly of non-executives and the remuneration
committee to be 'wholly or mainly' composed of non-executives. The committee
considered, but rejected suggestions that shareholders should have the
opportunity to vote on directors' pay. Sir Ron said that, after heated
discussion about the matter, the committee came to the view that such a rule
would hamper recruitment of qualified executives.
Interim financial statements should be discussed with auditors although need
not be formally audited.
Audit committees should meet at least once a year with external auditors
without the presence of executive directors.
Non-executives should be able to be remunerated by the company for the cost
of independent advice from outside professionals if necessary.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Canary Wharf in insolvency: Olympia &amp; York's London
subsidiary to go into administration today
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CANARY WHARF, the east London office development owned by Olympia &amp; York,
will today go into administration under UK insolvency procedures.
The placing of Europe's largest commercial property development in
administration leaves 12 international banks facing losses of up to half
their Pounds 1.2bn of loans to the project.
It also puts in question plans for the extension into east London of the
Jubilee underground rail line and will send a further tremor through the
battered property sector, particularly the other new developments in
London's docklands.
The appointment today of partners from accountancy firm Ernst &amp; Young as
administrators
may also spell the end of government plans to move more than 2,000 civil
servants to Canary Wharf. The prime minister, Mr John Major, has been
informed of the banks' decision. Mr Pen Kent, an associate director of the
Bank of England, has also been kept informed of developments.
At a meeting yesterday afternoon, two UK banks, Barclays and Lloyds, and
four Canadian banks, including Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Royal
Bank of Canada and Bank of Nova Scotia, voted to put O&amp;Y Canary Wharf
Holdings into administration, under UK law.
Citibank of the US, Credit Suisse of Switzerland and Credit Lyonnais of
France would have preferred to provide Canary Wharf with sufficient funds to
continue as a going concern, but they were out-voted.
There was little debate at the bankers' meeting as the banks'
representatives had arrived for the gathering with instructions from their
respective chairmen.
Nonetheless, until late last night there was still a question about whether
Canary Wharf would be put into receivership. That would mean its chances of
re-emerging as a going concern would have been far worse than under
administration. The banks decided to make the move for two main reasons:
It was a 'condition precedent' of their providing new money that the
government rent space at Canary Wharf for more than 2,000 civil servants.
However, some banks became tired of waiting for a firm commitment from the
government.
A legal obstacle arose in Canada which could have prevented the banks being
granted new shares in Canary Wharf as a going concern. They wanted the
shares as compensation for any new money they put up.
If the banks had decided to keep the project as a going concern, they would
have had to provide Pounds 20m immediately for Canary Wharf's needs in the
coming few weeks and a Pounds 500m facility to meet its longer term
requirements. The Pounds 500m requirement was far more than banks had
thought earlier that they needed to provide.
Some banks hope Canary Wharf may re-emerge as a going concern. They view the
administration process as providing a period for negotiations with the
government. Under administration, a re-construction plan could be drawn up.
Such a plan could still in-volve the banks providing funds for the Jubilee
line extension.
Before it ran into financial difficulties, O&amp;Y had promised to contribute
Pounds 400m to the cost of extending the Jubilee line. The government has
made clear that the extension will not be built without this contribution.
The administration order will bring Canary Wharf into line with many of
O&amp;Y's other subsidiaries, which filed for protection from creditors in
Canada and the US recently. The aim would be to produce a reconstruction
plan for Canary Wharf by October, when similar plans have to be completed in
Canada.
To date, banks have provided a core loan of Pounds 566m to Canary Wharf and
a finance lease of Pounds 58m. There is also a separate Pounds 450m loan
from four Canadian banks and Pounds 100m from the European Investment Bank.
Last night, bankers said they would have to make provisions against possible
losses of about 50 per cent on loans to Canary Wharf.
That would mean they collectively face losses of about Pounds 600m. Barclays
has the biggest exposure to Canary Wharf of the UK banks - Pounds 118m in
total.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (8): Keeping it to a
minimum / Considering the impact of 'green consumerism'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EARLIER THIS year, the Women's Environmental Network caused a furore by
targeting a J Sainsbury supermarket and ripping off all the 'excess'
packaging from its products and dumping it at the check-outs - an echo of
previous environmental campaigns in Germany.
Meanwhile, Friends of the Earth demonstrated last December outside Woolworth
and Ryman stores to protest against their selling Silly String and Snow
Spray in environmentally harmful CFC-filled spraycans.
Such protests are the most visible and vocal sign of how environmental
concerns directly affect retailers, although they are viewed as more of a
fuss than a threat to business. But arguably they represent only the tip of
a far more serious iceberg.
Partly as a result of such campaigns, millions of consumers throughout the
industrialised world have woken up to the environmental consequences of
their consumption and are determined to do something about it. Much of this
impulse towards 'green consumerism' - driven by the younger generations in
particular - is weak, inconsistent and at times contradictory, but it is
potent, nonetheless.
As John Elkington, director of the SustainAbility consultancy and co-author
of the Green Consumer Guide, told a CIES conference on Environment and the
Food Business earlier this year: 'A considerable proportion of tomorrow's
consumers will see their purchasing patterns as a useful lever to effect
environmental change, in effect to 'vote' yes for environmental quality. . .
Retailers need to recognise this trend - and to support it.'
Already, some companies - including B&amp;Q and Sainsbury's - have taken the
issue seriously and have acted to seize the initiative. They are realising
that, not only does such action help ease environmental pressures and win
customer goodwill, but that it also invariably leads to good business
practice.
Sainsbury's buyers are currently examining every product on their shelves,
to ensure they only use the minimum packaging fit for their purpose. The
company is discovering that, in addition to the environmental benefits, its
approach has produced substantial cost advantages.
For example, the simple expedient of reducing the size of its free tear-off
produce bags - in which customers cram their vegetables - has resulted in an
annual material saving of more than 600 tonnes of plastic, or 25 per cent of
the total.
Its decision to remove the polystyrene bases from under its pizzas has saved
a further 100 tonnes of plastic a year at a cost benefit of more than Pounds
150,000.
As one Dutch speaker noted, at a recent packaging conference, by taking such
initiatives retailers are able to act as the gearbox between the consumer
and the packaging manufacturer, transmitting the shoppers' desires into
buying orders, moving up or down depending on the speed of developments.
Retailers, therefore, exert a strong direct influence on their packaging
suppliers. But the packaging industry often complains that retailers attempt
to push the additional costs and inconvenience down the supply chain, and
will not shoulder responsibilities themselves. They are quite prepared to
reduce the amount of packaging, they say, but are not so keen to recover and
recycle.
In particular, they point to retailers' reluctance to complicate their
distribution networks by using them to return used packaging products to
their suppliers. They also highlight the inconsistencies of retailers'
environmental stances which have led to widely divergent policies across
Europe.
How can one retailer, such as Marks and Spencer, of the UK, encourage the
use of PVC packaging because it believes it is energy-efficient; while
another, such as Albert Heijn, the Dutch supermarket group, can
simultaneously insist on reducing the amount of PVC because it is not easily
recycled? In turn, however, retailers complain about the unresponsiveness of
the packaging industry in the face of their environmental concerns.
'Sometimes it is like drawing teeth,' says one leading retailer of his
attempts to encourage a dialogue with packaging suppliers.
As in so many other areas of the debate, it is clearly essential for both
sides to develop closer partnerships to respond to consumers' demands -
however inchoate they may be. For, although consumers would generally like
retailers to do more for the environment, they do not always know precisely
what.
Most consumers, of course, want the best of all worlds. They do not want
packaging that will compromise on convenience, or quality or products that
will be any less effective. And they would probably only accept a slight
diminution in the appeal of luxuriously packaged branded products. Consumers
are still likely to choose Scotch whiskies in posh boxes for presents, and
the distillers are always likely to use them to market their products -
unless legislation were to force them not to.
Consumers remain rightly sceptical of many of the sweeping environmental
claims made by retailers and consumer products manufacturers. But, equally,
there is perhaps now a danger of a backlash against some of the more absurd
and intrusive elements of environmental legislation. Even in eco-friendly
California, the beginnings of just such a trend are emerging regarding the
insistence on bio-degradable nappies, for example.
Consumers are also sharply divided about whether they want to pay much of a
premium for their consciences. In a Mintel survey last year, 35 per cent of
UK consumers said they were not willing to pay any extra for environmentally
friendly products, although 24 per cent said they would pay more than 5 per
cent extra, and 31 per cent said they were prepared to spend an extra 10 per
cent or more.
As one frustrated delegate told the CIES environmental conference: 'The only
issue more complicated than the environment is the human psychology that
affects consumer perceptions of the environmental issue, and how it
motivates their purchasing habits.'
But, difficult though it may be to interpret, it is now impossible to
ignore. The packaging and retailing industries must, at the very least, give
consumers the option of buying less environmentally harmful products and
living up to their responsibilities for minimising waste in all areas of
their businesses.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (9): No flash in the
pan - Case study, Tomlinson
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MANY MARKETING ideas are born in unusual circumstances, but few come in
stranger ways than Peter Kelly's.
Lying in a hospital bed with a dislocated shoulder, the director of a
pulp-moulding machinery manufacturer started ruminating about the German
shiny steel bed pans that the nurses brought round for the patients' relief.
'Why can't we make those?' he thought. And so he did.
His company, Tomlinson, which was founded in Rochdale in 1853, had for the
past 20 years supplied the machinery used for pulping waste paper to produce
egg cartons. Its machines were all exported for use in more than 100
countries, mainly in the third world.
But Mr Kelly believed that the move towards environmental awareness in the
industrialised world could perhaps provide new markets for pulp-moulded
products. Tomlinson could develop from a capital plant manufacturer towards
an integrated packaging group.
From his initial thought, Mr Kelly persuaded the company to investigate the
possibilities. The company designed a new rotary machine, in collaboration
with the University of Salford, and invested in computer-aided design
facilities to produce the necessary moulds for an array of different
applications.
It found that the material, which it called Fibrepack, could be used for a
wide variety of products, such as soap packages, cosmetics cases, hand tool
boxes and telephone and computer packaging insulation. 'We can now
tailor-make pulp moulded packaging to the individual client's needs,' he
says.
Tests showed that Fibrepack had good cushioning properties, and enhanced the
protection afforded to many products. It could also be laminated to make it
water-resistant.
The company believes there will be good consumer acceptance of Fibreapack,
which can be disposed of at traditional paper recycling banks. 'The material
has been around for years in egg boxes. All we are doing is giving it new
applications,' he says.
Mr Kelly, a former academic at the School of Oriental and African Studies
who later honed his marketing skills as a commercial trader in the Middle
East, says he was startled by the response from manufacturers who were
interested in using the new material:
'We started it all on a wing and a prayer. But we are now in a situation
where this has taken off in a completely unplanned way. People are trying to
be the first into the marketplace with alternative environmental products.'
Tomlinson is about to set up a new plant just to make medical products out
of the material for the National Health Service. The company has already
sold two medical products machines to a manufacturer in Italy.
Mr Kelly claims that it costs 17p in terms of labour, energy and capital
equipment depreciation every time a traditional bedpan is sterilised in an
autoclave. The pulp-moulded variety costs 3p. Once soiled they go into a
special macerator.
Mr Nigel Watts, chairman and managing director of Tomlinson, who led a
management team that bought the family-run company three and a half years
ago, says the new markets are providing it with great growth opportunities.
'When we took over, the company had turnover of Pounds 1m. We have invested
heavily in new product development and got the turnover up to Pounds 5m.
This year we will get to Pounds 10m,' he says.
Mr Watts believes there are particularly good market opportunities in North
America and Japan. 'There has been a major shift in emphasis in our business
away from the third world to the first world, and that shift is entirely due
to environmental emotion. We have got a product that anticipates the
legislative climate that is emerging,' he says.
But the company has encountered some embarrassing moments in trying to sell
its products, not least when it received strong protests from old soldiers
in the Royal British Legion when it unfurled a Japanese flag to welcome a
visiting trade delegation.
In overseas markets, Tomlinson plans to export its machines and exploit
Fibrepack's appeal through forming local joint ventures with packaging
companies with marketing expertise. Paper collection systems and markets for
recycled products vary enormously throughout the world. In Australia, for
example, Mr Kelly says huge amounts of waste paper are collected through
Rotary clubs.
Pulp moulding machinery can greatly help countries to improve their
recycling capabilities. Mr Kelly cites the example of Tasmania, which at one
time had to ship all its waste newspapers to Australia and re-import the
reprocessed material, because it did not have any suitable pulp mills
itself. With Tomlinson's machines, he claims that Tasmania can now put its
old newspapers to good use.
Mr Kelly also takes particular pride in the company's record of selling
paper-converting equipment to the Scandinavians - an achievement he likens
to selling fridges to the Eskimos. 'We have done all this within the
constraints of our Lowry-style mill in Rochdale,' he says.
Tomlinson's corporate evolution will also have some substantial financial
benefits. Over the past two years, the company has had some scary moments
with its banks, because of the strains imposed by high development costs.
'One of the problems of a capital plant manufacturer,' says Mr Kelly, 'is
that you build a machine and get paid, and then you sit around waiting to
sell the next big machine. So you have a highly unstable cash-flow position.
Packaging sales will now provide the group with a steady income.'
Nevertheless, he accepts that the company will face a tough job in
establishing its Fibrepack product in consumer markets, and will confront a
considerable challenge in managing its fast pace of growth.
But he smiles, and says that, whatever happens, he will always derive a
quiet satisfaction from the knowledge that his pulp moulding machines are
daily turning newspapers into bedpans.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (7): Sectors vie to
be seen in a green light - Liquid packaging / The size of the market made it
one of the first areas to attract EC legislators' attention
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GAIL LEA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1990, 6.7bn litres of soft drinks were consumed in the UK. Add 785m
litres of fruit juices and 400m litres of bottled water, and you begin to
realise why competition between the various forms of packaging in this
sector is so fiercely competitive.
And these statistics do not include alcoholic beverages or milk.
The sheer size of this market was probably why, along with the competing
elements of the packaging industry, it was one of the first areas to attract
the attention of EC legislators. Drinks packaging is also immediately
visible to the consumer - in streets and countryside and on beaches.
EC Directive 85/359, on containers of liquids for human consumption,
requires member states to 'minimise the environmental impact of used
containers, encourage a reduction in their use of energy and raw materials,
and report to the commission actions taken and results achieved.'
In response, the Boustead &amp; Hancock Report on the energy and raw materials
requirements of liquid food container systems in the UK was commissioned by
the government and relevant industry sectors. It covered the packaging
systems used for soft drinks, alcoholic beverages, milk, vinegar and edible
oils - 10 different systems in all  - and was published in 1989. An update
is due, which will show what improvements in resource-efficiency industry
has made.
However, anyone looking to this report for a clear league table of which
material or system is the most environmentally friendly would be
disappointed. 'No single container system leads the field in all respects,'
said co-author, Ian Boustead, of the Open University, in a paper published
in the same year.
'While it is possible to identify specific environmental problems, it is
important to remember that they are frequently interlinked. Action taken in
an attempt to solve one problem can often exacerbate the effects of
another,' he warned.
'Therefore environmental decision making should not be confined solely to
identifying a solution to a given problem; it should also demonstrate that
the proposed solution does not cause more problems than it solves, he
advised.'
Herein lies the basis of current thinking in much of the packaging industry,
and in all aspects of the packaging chain, not only in liquid packaging.
Taking one aspect in isolation, manufacturing energy usage, for example,
will give a rating for each material that will bear no resemblance to the
league table that comprises raw material requirements.
A cradle-to-grave or life-cycle analysis of any given container is
increasingly seen, therefore, as the only sensible way to proceed in
balancing the different environmental priorities. The difficulty at present,
however, is that a comprehensive set of data covering the whole field, and
collected according to one universally accepted methodology, is not yet
available.
Work is in progress at leading independent research organisation, Pira
International, which is represented on international committees under the
auspices of CEN (Comite European de Normalisation).
Drinks manufacturers and their packaging suppliers cannot afford, however,
to sit back and wait for this information to be established as they have to
respond to new draft legislation - the EC directive on packaging and
packaging waste has superseded the beverage proposals - as well as
increasingly green-minded consumers.
In reality, although it is denied by the industry, the lack of independent
and authoritative information means each of the material sectors is fiercely
protecting its own market share by claiming environmental superiority over
others. Each highlights the aspect that puts them at the top of any one
league of environmental priorities in itsliterature.
The debate has moved on from the mud-slinging witnessed in the 1980s: the
nature of the business, especially liquid packaging, dictates this, as any
one drink can be marketed in several pack styles. Each material is seeking
the same business and this makes it difficult for the industry always to
project a united front, even though attacks are generally made against
packaging per se.
From a consumer point of view, it is easy to understand how glass bottles,
aluminium cans and steel cans could have a better environmental image than,
say, plastic bottles and paper-based cartons, even though each of the five
has merits.
In 1991, 1.2bn used steel cans were recovered for recycling. Magnetic
extraction is now available to an estimated 8m people, and the Save-a-Can
network is present in districts housing 7.3m people. The UK recycling rate
for used aluminium cans doubled from 5.5 per cent in 1990 to 11 per cent
last year, or 462m cans.
Glass recycling represents 21 per cent of all national glass production. The
approximate number of people using bottle banks is said to be 10m a week,
with 385,387 tonnes of glass recycled in 1991.
On the plastics front, several schemes, including one in Sheffield, have
been set up over the last few years, but actual recycling rates of
post-consumer material are relatively low. Plastics are lightweight,
however, and can save energy in their production, transportation and use.
While it is true that beverage cartons currently cannot be re-used like
returnable bottles, incinerators in some parts of Europe release energy from
the pack for delivery to consumers. Cartons also have a minimal weight; they
come from a renewable resource base and have low impact on waste disposal
systems.
How do these green factors impact on the market itself, as demonstrated by
consumer buying decisions on liquid packaging?
According to Nielsen Marketing Research, total sales of carbonated soft
drinks increased by 1.4 per cent in 1991 over the previous year. Plastics
(PET) grew by 6.1 per cent; cans by 1.3 per cent and glass fell by 28 per
cent.
Yet, in the take-home beer sector, sales measured by Stats MR produced
different findings for the same period. In a total market that declined by
1.2 per cent, plastics (PET) fell by 15; cans by only 0.8 per cent, while
glass bottles rose by 9.5 per cent. This was, however, from a small base.
Doorstep deliveries now make up 65 per cent of UK milk sales, with over a
quarter of the market now accounted for by cartons and plastics (HDPE)
containers in the multiples and the remainder by corner shops. If these
trends continue, doorstep deliveries could be down to 45 per cent by the
year 2000.
Rather than buying on environmental grounds, consumers seem to be still
basing their decisions on fitness for purpose and convenience. For example,
an 80-year-old single person does not want a 3-litre plastics bottle of
lemonade, while a family of four finds this medium ideal.
According to Boustead &amp; Hancock's report, consumers are an integral part of
the liquid food delivery systems, in terms of material recovery. It is,
therefore, difficult to justify changes in other less significant parts of
the system, if the consumer is left untouched, they argued:
'This may be a politically sensitive area, but action would be a true test
of environmental will.'

FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (5): Huge demand
expected on route to market economy / Exploring opportunities in eastern
Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE OF the great ironies of the European packaging industry is that, while
the western half of the continent seeks anxiously ways to restrict what it
produces, the eastern half tries desperately to raise its levels of
production.
East of the Elbe river, concerns about the environmental impact of packaging
are submerged by the desire to achieve an acceptable standard of living.
Packaging clearly plays a pivotal role in the process.
Under the direction of communist planners, the packaging industries of
eastern Europe generally suffered chronic under-investment and failed to
provide adequate delivery systems for food and consumer products.
An Economist Intelligence report on the market, prepared by the
Budapest-based Echo consultancy, says investment was based largely on the
'residue principle': investment in packaging had a low priority.
This resulted in severe under-development of machinery and infrastructure,
leading to an appalling waste of resources. Estimates vary, but the EIU
suggests the former Soviet Union squandered about a quarter of its food
production because packaging was poor or non-existent.
The sector has been targeted as an area of strategic importance by national
governments and investing institutions from the west, such as the European
Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD).
They argue that good quality packaging will not only improve living
standards within these countries, but will also facilitate the export of
goods, enabling manufacturing companies to earn hard currency, vital for
buying western capital plant to upgrade the manufacturing base.
It is difficult for a capitalist system to flourish in the absence of
capital, but even modest investments can yield huge benefits by reducing
wastage.
Visitors to the Ukraine tell how the roads are covered with golden wheat at
harvest time, because it blows off lorries for lack of tarpaulins. A western
project to provide plastic bags for Moscow has ensured lower wastage in
transporting bread and lengthened its shelf-life.
Given the vast scale of the challenges, it is all too easy to be
pessimistic; but, conversely, the packaging industry's past neglect also
creates great opportunities for future long-term development.
As the countries of eastern Europe grope towards fully-functioning market
economies, there is likely to be a phenomenal demand for packaging products
 -outstripping growth in almost all other areas of the world.
However, the instability caused by the collapse of Soviet markets, which
were of crucial importance to many central European industries, may at least
temporarily check the process.
Marketpower, a UK research company, estimates that between 1990 and 1995 the
value of packaging in the region will rise from Ecu37.8bn to Ecu74bn.
The former East Germany will demonstrate the fastest growth at 18.6 per cent
a year, it suggests, followed by the former Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia and
Poland at about 14 per cent. This pattern of growth will seemingly break the
truism of development in most industrialised economies where the rate of
growth in packaging has simply mirrored the trend in gross domestic product.
But although the overall market may increase significantly, individual
segments are likely to perform very differently. The Marketpower study
suggests that PVC and paper packaging products will decline in usage and
tinplate, cartonboard, glass jars and polypropylene will show very little
real growth.
It suggests the fastest growing materials are likely to be be PET, cans,
polyethylene, aluminium and corrugated materials. There are good
opportunities for native and foreign enterprises to exploit these market
opportunities.
Western companies such as Huntsman, the US chemicals and plastic packaging
company, and Tetra Pak Alfa-Laval, the Swedish liquid packaging and
processing group, are already carving out significant shares of their chosen
markets.
Environmental concerns are acute in many countries in the region but, sadly,
it is all too likely they will take a back seat in the dash for economic
growth - confirming the belief that environmentalism is largely the
prerogative of the affluent.
However, the industries in some central European countries, and in
particular, Hungary, are at a more advanced stage of evolution and provide
greater hope.
Earlier this year, Mr Gyorgy Viszkei, secretary-general of the Hungarian
Association of Packaging and Materials Handling, told a Financial Times
packaging conference that his government intended to introduce legislation
to harmonise its environmental packaging policies with European Commission
regulations within the next two to three years.
He accepted, however, that the country would face an uphill struggle to
implement such plans: Hungary had previously made no provision for
collecting or recycling household waste and largely lacked the means to
finance cost-intensive environmental investments.
But an example of what it is possible to achieve is the success of Petofi
Nyomda Rt, a Hungarian packaging and printing company, which received the
first industrial loan from the EBRD last year.
Petofi, in which the Italian industrialist Carlo De Benedetti has a
controlling interest, is not only helping to develop the Hungarian industry
but is also earning valuable foreign currency by manufacturing products for
western companies in Germany and Austria, such as Marlboro cigarette
cartons, MacDonald's French fry holders, Henkel detergent boxes and Mars
candy wrappers.
Last year, the company increased turnover by a quarter to the equivalent of
Dollars 40m (Pounds 21.8m), about half of which is accounted for by exports.
Eastern Europe will need many other such packaging companies if it is to
create viable economies. 'A major reason why the previous political systems
lost the support of the people was that they were unable to achieve economic
success. It would entail consequences that are difficult to foresee if the
functioning of market economies resulted in similar experiences,' says Mr
Viszkei.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (6): The dustbin
holds a cocktail - Don't only blame the packaging
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PACKAGING is usually seen as the biggest generator of waste. Yet used
packaging accounts for only a quarter by weight of household waste, and a
similar amount by volume of waste that is landfilled.
Even if all packaging were removed from the waste stream, therefore, there
would still be a waste problem.
The contents of a typical UK household consists of: packaging (24 per cent),
other paper (29), food and garden waste (25) and other materials (22).
The real problem with waste is the need to handle it in an environmentally
acceptable way, whether it is recycled, incinerated or landfilled.
UK local authorities have generally provided outstanding services, and UK
and EC legislation now coming into force will improve standards still
further.
Even so, legislators charged with improving waste management services often
reveal a myopic approach that places a disproportionate emphasis on
packaging because of its high visibility.
For example, the European Commission's draft packaging and packaging waste
directive appears to assume, wrongly, that packaging waste contributes to
the increase in the volume of wastes and the saturation of landfills. This
is not supported by the available evidence.
A report by Dr Harvey Alter, of the resources and policy department of the
US Chamber of Commerce, shows that in the US the per capita generation of
household waste has been statistically constant for many years, and that the
amount of packaging waste disposed of has levelled off and is showing a
slight decline. A similar pattern is likely to be true for northern Europe.
In 1980, the Industry Council for Packaging and the Environment (Incpen) and
Merseyside county council carried out a detailed analysis that identified
the packaging component of household waste; and, over the past three years,
Incpen and the departments of Environment and Trade and Industry have been
funding a similar analysis of household waste in Sheffield.
Although these studies are local and may not be representative of national
compositions, they do show a small decrease in the total weight of packaging
in household waste in the past 10 years.
The same decade has seen the number of goods and the range of foods
available increase dramatically, higher health and safety standards, and
greater versatility of packaging with the use of more resources.
This is the result of better technology, which has allowed glass, paper,
plastics and metals to be used more sparingly to do the same job better, or
to do jobs that previously could not be done at all.
There is, of course, potential for re-using some packaging, but the emphasis
should be placed on recycling the materials for which end-use markets are
most easily available and those that contribute the greatest quantities to
waste.
It is possible to imagine an ideal system for handling used packaging. It
would look something like this, with the figures in brackets showing the
percentage of each in household waste: bottle banks for collecting glass
(6-8 per cent); magnets for extracting the steel cans from the waste in the
dustbin (5-6); financial incentives to collect aluminium cans (less than 1);
some sort of collection system for plastic bottles (2), if a market for them
existed.
Paper packaging (5 per cent of domestic waste) and plastics films (3 per
cent) are usually too contaminated by food to be recycled as materials. They
do, however, have a significant calorific value. So, in areas where there is
an incinerator, their intrinsic energy value can be recovered.
The waste-handling systems at incinerators also allow the easy magnetic
extraction of steel cans, either before or after burning.
The government's scheme to make greater use of non-fossil fuel sources of
energy is providing economic incentives that should increase the amount of
waste incinerated. Though many environmental groups claim that incineration
is dangerous, because of emissions, the evidence suggests that these fears
are unfounded, provided incinerators are operated to the standards laid down
by the EC.
The ideal system, therefore, makes use of a number of different
waste-handling options. But none is better than another, because each is
more or less appropriate according to the type of waste, waste management
infrastructure and geographical circumstances.
In particular, in environmental terms, landfill should not always be seen as
'the last resort'. It can have positive benefits.
For example, the House of Commons select committee on the environment, in
its report on the draft EC directive on the landfill of waste, published in
July 1991, states:
'We are firmly of the view that landfill, when based on good science and
operated and controlled to the highest technological standards, constitutes
a safe and cost-effective means of waste disposal, and in some cases is the
best practicable environmental option.'
Packaging can also provide a market for some recycled materiaIs. About 90
per cent of UK-produced paper and board packaging is made from waste paper
and board. Used glass and metals can go back to make new packaging. Used
plastics and paper packaging cannot easily be used again as packaging,
because over two-thirds of these materials are used in contact with food,
and hygiene requirements cannot be assured. However, there are some uses in
non-food packaging and other goods.
The fact is that some types of packaging are more suitable for recycling
than others. But that does not mean both types cannot have equal
environmental benefits. Glass bottles, for example, are relatively cheap to
manufacture, use plentiful raw materials and can be re-used and recycled;
but they are expensive and resource intensive in the distribution chain.
Plastics, on the other hand, are difficult to recycle, but use a small
amount of resources and are cheap to transport because of their light
weight.
The present obsession with solid waste should not be allowed to dictate how
packaging is designed.
Rather than have targets for recycling, a more useful - and environmentally
more rewarding - target would be to reduce the overall use of resources in
packaged goods distribution systems. If specific targets within that overall
aim were required, then a reduction in the number of lorries on the roads,
by using the optimum amount of material per pack, would have a clear
environmental benefit.
The environmental challenge for industry is not primarily to devise entirely
recyclable packaging, but to produce packaging and associated distribution
systems that prevent the waste of food and goods and protect human health.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (3): Only mild
grumbles - Germany
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PARKES

<TEXT>
THERE HAS been no lack of complaints from German industry over the flood of
regulations on packaging and recycling from Mr Klaus Topfer's environment
ministry.
But, considering the business community's normally rigid resistance to
interventionist policies from Bonn, the grumbling has been mild. It has been
concerned more with timetables and technology than with the guiding
principle, widely embraced by the population, that the throw-away society
has had its day.
ing those who resisted his proposals, has there been any fuss from the
competition authorities in Brussels: no summons to the European Court of
Justice in Luxembourg. Although the European Commission's own proposals on
packaging and recycling are less rigorous than those already implanted in
Germany, the minister is encouraged. 'We can see the same building blocks we
used in our regulations,' he said in a recent interview. 'Therefore, others
have been convinced.'
But not everyone. Britain's Industry Council for Packaging and the
Environment (Incpen), has formally complained that the latest round of rules
'restricts the free movement of goods into Germany.' It also claims, as do
German environmentalist groups, that, because the German recycling industry
will not be able to cope with the flood of returned packaging, it will be
shipped in other countries, such as Poland which is hungry for foreign
exchange, overloading their waste disposal systems and adding to their
already hefty environmental burdens.
There are already signs of strain. The plastics industry association, faced
with taking back an estimated 1m tonnes of packing each year, recently
appealed directly to chancellor Helmut Kohl for a stay of execution of the
legal requirement that, from July 1995, they must recycle at least 64 per
cent of the packaging output.
The industry claimed that, in the time before the deadline, it would be able
to install only enough capacity to deal with 20 per cent, and it would be
1999 before it could cope properly. The same conditions have been set for
paper, glass and metal waste.
Mr Topfer immediately rejected the appeal, and his officials claimed that
the problem would tend to resolve itself. Confronted with specific deadlines
and quotas, industry would reduce its output and use of plastic packing, and
therefore reduce the need for reprocessing plant.
Meanwhile, some sectors are getting on with the job. According to the BASF
chemicals group, more than 35 per cent of the 30,000 tonnes of polystyrene
foam used each year for packaging in Germany is already being re-used. It is
typically either milled and re-used in its ground-up state in packing,
potting composts or lightweight cement and concrete products, or melted down
and recycled entirely.
The Storopack-Reichenecker Group, a leading manufacturer with five recycling
plants already in operation, calculates this year on using recycled product
in up to 50 per cent of its annual output. Its plant in Langenau,
Baden-Wurttemberg, can handle 600kg an hour, and is claimed to be the
biggest in Europe.
Despite the continued griping, the commercial as well as the environmental
benefits of Mr Topfer's grand design are beginning to emerge. German
companies, forced to adapt, are rapidly developing new recycling
technologies and building a competitive position for when similar
legislation is introduced elsewhere. Virtually every major engineering
concern in the country now has a division dedicated to environmental
technology. Car manufacturers and domestic appliance makers are well along
the road to meeting the minister's next requirements: that they should be
responsible for taking back and recycling their products when they finally
leave the road or run through their last cycle.
Meanwhile, the country's whole waste handling and disposal system is in the
throes of a revolution: again a possible model for others of public and
private services working in parallel.
Duales System Deutschland (DSD), an independent collection and recycling
company set up last year by retailers and manufacturers to help cope with
the new rules, is making rapid progress. The 400 companies which launched it
had grown to around 3,000 at the last count. Its income from licensing
members to mark their products with Der Grune Punkt (the Green Spot) is
already around DM2bn (Pounds 683m) a year.
The Green Spot is a guarantee that the maker has undertaken to take the
package back and re-use or recycle it. Loudly denounced by environmentalists
as a confidence trick and nothing more than a way of artificially increasing
prices (the cost of the mark, depending on the size of the package, ranges
from 1 pfennig to 20 pfennigs a pack).
They claim manufacturers have signed up with DSD and increased their prices
while its disposal and recycling functions are still in their infancy. A
grand project to equip every household in the country with a special yellow
dustbin to hold Green Spot packs is still on trial in only three areas,
including Bonn. Collected by the public authorities, their contents are
sorted and shipped off for recycling by private companies.
Germany's tidy-minded citizens, among the most environmentally-concerned in
the world, are well-accustomed to playing their part in environmental
protection.
However, there are some signs of fatigue among the population. Bins
installed in shops since April to collect outer packaging are relatively
under-used. Shoppers complain they have no time, or that the bins are
inconveniently placed.
What is already obvious, however, is that the manufacturing, retailing and
packaging industries are adapting. Karstadt, a leading department chain,
reported in April that it had asked suppliers to dispense with outer
packaging on more than 5,000 products. According to the environment
ministry, one of the country's biggest food retailers has calculated that
outer wrappers are unnecessary on 98 per cent of its grocery lines.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (2): The patchwork
that has to be ironed out / The EC's tightening grip
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PACKAGING industry is at the centre of an emotional tussle with the
European Commission over plans for EC-wide rules covering disposal of waste
used for wrapping products.
EC plans for a harmonisation of packaging rules have attracted hostility,
both from industrialists claiming that legislation will impose unfair
burdens and from environmentalists calling for tougher action to curb the
surge in waste from the 'throw-away society'.
The EC's 12 members have put into effect a highly disparate series of
regulations on the treatment of packaging waste. As in other areas of the
environment, the most stringent action has been taken in Germany, the
traditional leader in 'green' policy.
The patchwork of systems, both voluntary and imposed, requires companies
operating throughout the EC to apply widely different targets, quotas,
levies and deposit measures on waste generated by packaging - a sizeable
barrier to cross-border trade.
Ironing out these disparities through the introduction of a common
regulatory framework forms an important part of the aim of establishing a
Community-wide single market for consumer goods. Yet legislation in the
field of packaging also represents possibly the most difficult example of
the bid to frame common rules to bridge the Community's north-south gap.
The EC has to struggle to encompass both the concerns of the 'green'
northern countries, led by Germany, and those of the poorer southern nations
such as Spain and Portugal trying to catch up with higher living standards
elsewhere. Governments in these southern countries see much EC environmental
law as an expensive and unnecessary obstacle to this aim.
The strict packaging legislation introduced by Germany during the past year
serves as a highly controversial benchmark for the rest of the Community.
The German law was further stiffened on April 1, when consumers gained the
right to hand back unnecessary wrapping to retailers at the point of sale.
Germany's measures have already sparked complaints from industrialists in
other countries. This partly reflects fears that products from elsewhere in
the EC are likely to face discrimination on the German market.
Additionally, the large levels of excess waste material collected in Germany
from recycling schemes threaten to swamp waste markets throughout the
Community - unsettling attempts elsewhere to set up viable schemes for
reusing waste. There has also been criticism that Germany's recycling
schemes themselves are intrinsically inefficient. Far more energy is used
collecting and transporting packaging waste around Germany, it is claimed,
than is being saved through attempted passage towards an
environment-friendly waste regime.
Reflecting the impact of such criticisms, the final version of Brussels'
plans for a packaging directive seems likely to be far less stringent than
the measures in force in Germany. The Commission's plan of action centres on
a 10-year programme for the reduction of packaging waste and the achievement
of recovery and recycling targets. Individual countries are unlikely to
transcribe the Community's proposals into national law until the mid-1990s.
But first the EC's finalposition will have to be drawn up - probably after
the summer.
The tussle between industry and the environmental regulators looks likely to
be one of the more intriguing wrangles coming to a head during Britain's
six-month presidency of the Community in the second half of this year.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Survey of Packaging and the Environment (4): Looking across
frontiers - The UK / Examining the health of its container makers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAULINE COVELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK packaging industry is large by any measure: it has an annual turnover
of about Pounds 8.5bn, and represents some 10 per cent of GDP.
A service as well as a manufacturing industry, it has much to contribute to
current UK industry demands for efficiency, economy and reliability. Over
the last five years it has also had to react to environmental demands - or
what its main customers, the food and beverage producers, see as consumers'
'green' demands.
It has also, like most UK industrial sectors, been forced to react to the
coming of the single European market which has brought with it a jostling
for position among the larger materials and containers companies both from
within the Community and outside.
UK businesses have bought into continental European footholds, and vice
versa - especially where it makes no sense to transport air in empty
containers across long distances. UK companies and their continental
competitors have also set up sales organisations across Europe, so as to be
able to operate across national frontiers more easily.
America, Japan and Scandinavia, the other homes of advanced packaging
technology, have been anxious,too, that the large EC market should not close
its doors on them, and companies from these centres continue to acquire or
start EC based European companies. Typical of this is the Scandinavian move
into the UK board industry and PLM's takeover of Redfearn Glass.
In June 1990, the UK's largest independent paper and packaging company,
Reedpack, went into foreign ownership when it was taken over - for Pounds
1.44bn - by Swedish group Svenska Cellulosa Aktiebolaget (SCA), although it
has since divested parts of the business - for example, RPC Containers (the
plastics containers company), acquired by the management just over a year
ago.
The other main pre-occupation of the industry, however, over the past two
years has been the state of the domestic and international economy. With
approximately two thirds of materials and containers being used for food and
drink, and a further 5 per cent for pharmaceuticals, much of the industry,
although not recession-proof, has not suffered nearly as badly as other
sectors.
UK manufacturers' sales figures of materials and containers are not yet
available for 1991, but there is likely to be little increase on the 1990
figure of Pounds 8.5bn.
According to Rowena Mills Associates (RMA), the specialist economist in the
packaging industry, the 1990 split in value by sector was: paper and board
33 per cent; plastics (film and containers) 30 per cent; metal (cans and
drums) 20 per cent; glass 5 per cent; labels 5 per cent and other materials
7 per cent.
Between them, the three major businesses - paper and board, plastics and
metals - account for 85 per cent of the Pounds 8.5bn. Plastics continues to
vie with the fibre-based materials for the number one spot, and, in terms of
tonnages consumed, showed a similar growth to the previous year. At 4.6 per
cent, it rose from 1,418,000 tonnes in 1989 to 1,483,000 tonnes in 1990.
This was lower than in the mid to late 1980s, when growth ran into double
figures, but reflected factors other than those purely associated with the
recession, says RMA. Lightweighting and downgauging, the process of reducing
the weight/unit ratio and perhaps, to some extent, environmental factors are
thought to have been at work.
Among the plastics materials, low-density polyethylene was the only polymer
that fell marginally. Bottle demand in all polymers was up by some 11 per
cent and PET (polyester) demand continued to rise rapidly - up by 43 per
cent. Most of this growth was accounted for by film rather than what is now
the traditional container for carbonated beverages, the PET bottle market.
Environmental concerns and the consequent legislation will change the way
plastics develop in the future, compared with the last 30 years, according
to recent research work by Maack Business Services in Switzerland.
While it believes that there will be large substitution losses from
polyethylene, polystyrene and PVC across Europe, there will be balancing
growth in polypropylene (PP) and PET up to the year 2000.
Plastics packaging films are here to stay, but Maack predicts that more than
20 per cent of the PP market in 2,000 will represent substitution of other
polymers, while for PET the percentage is even higher, at more than 50 per
cent.
Recession was responsible for a relatively poor year for paper and board.
Demand for packaging and wrapping fell back 10 per cent, from 76,800 to
69,000 tonnes, and paper sack sales continued to decline, as industries such
as cement reduced their demand. Fibreboard, corrugated and solid board case
materials fared better in this sector, with food and beverage transit
packaging holding up, partly as a result of increased summer beverage sales;
but demand for consumer durables, notably white goods (another big user of
fibre board) fell back. Industry estimates put 1990 square meterage of
corrugated fibreboard at 3,401m, compared with the 1989 figure of 3,360m.
Cartons volume was down very slightly in 1990, at 0.5 per cent, with only
the gift carton area suffering in a sector that largely remained unaffected
by recession. Half are used by the food industry. The UK folding carton
industry has sales of about Pounds 920m, converting more than 600,000 tonnes
of material a year. In Europe, only Germany converts more - in the region of
700,000 tonnes.
Sales of open-top cans for human food fell, and there was limited recovery
for those for pet food. The excellent summer of 1990 contributed to a 9.5
per cent increase in sales of carbonated drinks, and nearly 6 per cent for
beer, giving a strong push for the beverage can. Overall, 13.7bn metal cans
and containers were sold in 1990 (1989: 13.1bn).
According to CMB Foodcan, , despite the challenges from many quarters, the
can has notched up some notable successes - not least in the petfood sector,
for which in the UK 2bn steel cans are currently being produced each year.
Beverage cans (both steel and aluminium) exceed 7bn a year.
One area on the metals front where environmental perceptions have had a
clear impact has been in the market for aerosols. For a second year, sales
dropped by over 4 per cent.
Glass containers were also helped by the good weather in the summer of 1990
 -at 1.9 per cent, the increase was slightly more rapid than the previous
year. But, says RMA, while there was much talk about the environmental
friendliness of glass, there was no significant shift for specific products
towards this material on these grounds. The 1990 figure was 5,972m units,
compared with 5,862m the previous year.
Labels have seen a significant shift from paper and wet glue to
self-adhesive varieties. Labels as a whole grew from 703m to 723m square
metres in 1990, but, according to RMA, self-adhesives forged ahead by some 9
per cent, while competitive materials dropped back.
Although there are giants, as in any industry, the packaging business is
characterised by its hundreds of medium to small companies.
Paul Curtis, chairman of the Institute of Packaging and a manager at carton
converter BPCC Taylowe, says there are some 230 registered carton
manufacturers competing in a market for which around a 2 per cent growth is
predicted by some analysts.
However, the market share is all important. Sixteen companies account for
almost 60 per cent of the total market. All have turnovers in excess of
Pounds 10m a year. Another 63, in the Pounds 1-Pounds 10m turnover region,
account for the next 34 per cent. This leaves approximately 150 businesses
competing for the remaining 7 per cent.
There is no doubt that the main challenge to today's packaging industry is
concern for the environment.
Recycling of paper and board is well in place, cans are a valuable source of
metals, and plastics packaging can provide the material for other products
or fuel for energy. But much of the development in the use of recycled
materials and their economic viability will rely on the success or failure
of collection schemes.

the law - The industry has reacted with dismay to being depicted as a

industrialised world. But its high visibility and throw-away culture
connotations have made it a prime target

MR HANS Rausing, the chairman of the Swedish Tetra Pak Alfa-Laval group,
whose great height and business reputation means that he towers over the
packaging industry both physically and symbolically, tells a simple story to
illustrate the necessity of packaging products.
Browsing through an English 1920s detective novel in his father's library,
he came across a passage in which a group of upper-class women in London
were discussing how to get good milk.
'As late as the 1920s, in the richest city in Europe, these well-to-do women
could not find decent milk,' he says incredulously. 'The reason? Lack of
packaging.'
According to Mr Rausing, between 1912 and 1937 there were 65,000 deaths
attributable to infections from raw milk in England; between 1951 and 1980
there were just four. Effective packaging was at least partly responsible
for this substantial reduction. 'The food industry and food distribution
could not function without packaging,' he says.
Throughout the third world, millions of people have accepted the truth of
this remark, and are desperately trying to make the same move up the
packaging ladder to a situation where food products are safely processed,
packed and distributed.
In central and eastern Europe, too, there is a vast need for improvements in
the management of food distribution to help prevent the appalling
squandering of resources. Even in the most dilapidated parts of the former
Soviet empire, there is rarely a shortage of produce at the farm gates but
there is invariably a deficit of goods on the shop shelves.
Given the essential tasks that it believes it performs, the packaging
industry has therefore reacted with a sense of dismay, bordering on disgust,
to being depicted as a dirty polluter in a wave of environmental legislation
that has swept across the industrialised world.
Used packaging looms large in the eyes of consumers, as they daily see it as
litter on street corners and cram it into their dustbins - Americans
probably hold the world record, generating four pounds of rubbish every day.
Because of its high visibility and connotations with a 'throw-away' culture,
the packaging industry has been a prime target for environmental campaigners
who have found it easy to stir up popular passions. Politicians have
naturally responded by introducing legislation.
In Germany, the forceful environment minister, Mr Klaus Topfer, has
effectively coerced industry into establishing a massive recycling scheme
called the Duales System Deutschland (DSD). This system promises to recycle
ever-increasing proportions of used packaging and drastically reduce the
volume of waste going to landfill sites.
The industrial architects of the scheme stress that it is experimental and
will be fine-tuned over time, but its introduction has, nevertheless,
provoked furious controversy within the European packaging industry.
Companies outside Germany complain that mountains of waste products - which
cannot yet be absorbed into existing recycling schemes within Germany - are
being dumped on foreign markets, destroying the fragile economics of
indigenous recycling projects.
One leading figure in the packaging industry recently described the DSD
system as 'absolute lunacy', because it devoured more energy in recovering
and re-using waste packaging than it saved - resulting in a net negative
impact on the environment.
Other countries, particularly in Scandinavia and the Netherlands, have also
introduced stringent environmental legislation affecting packaging products.
The European Commission is also polishing up the final drafts of its
directive for the avoidance of packaging waste, which is expected to be
published later this year.
The legislative picture is, if anything, even more confused in North
America. At a packaging conference earlier this year, Mr John Bence, a
senior vice-president of Stone Container Corporation, described the
difficulties of dealing with the 'crazy quilt' of state and local laws that
had been created in the US. In 1990, he said, 38 states enacted 140
recycling laws, most with different stipulations.
But many independent industry observers are now pausing and seriously
questioning whether this onslaught of popular and legislative pressure is
addressing the real problems associated with packaging and the environment.
Professor Bill Rathje, an American garbologist from the University of
Arizona, who spends his days digging up old landfill sites to examine what
lies within, says there is a vast discrepancy between public perceptions of
the problem and the realities.
In consumer surveys in the US, most people believed that fast-food
packaging, such as McDonald's clam shells, accounted for more than 20 per
cent of the volume of landfill sites, with polystyrene foam representing
more than 30 per cent and disposable diapers - or nappies  - filling more
than 25 per cent. The real figures in an average landfill site, according to
Prof Rathje, are 0.25 per cent, 0.9 per cent and 0.8 per cent respectively.
Almost half of landfill sites are stuffed with newspapers and other paper
products - which only decompose very slowly. Construction rubble and organic
waste also account for a substantial proportion.
In the grand scheme of things, therefore, domestic packaging waste ranks low
in the list of environmental priorities, representing perhaps only 2-3 per
cent of the total waste generated by modern industrial economies.
Nevertheless, such facts certainly do not absolve the industry. There is
undoubtedly far more that it can sensibly do to reduce the environmental
impact of packaging. Much more progress can be made in 'lightweighting'
products by using less raw material, redesigning packages to include more
recycled, enlarging them to increase the ratio of volume to area, and even
changing the nature of the contents by introducing concentrated detergents,
for example.
In general, the response of the packaging industry to the environmental
onslaught has been pretty pitiful, as many in the industry privately admit.
Trade associations in each different sector of the packaging industry -
including glass, aluminium, tinplate, plastics, paper and board - have all
lobbied hard to 'prove' the environmental acceptability of their own
products - often maligning their rivals products in the process.
But this has only exacerbated tensions in what has always been a highly
fragmented industry. No one has yet acted effectively to adopt a broader
perspective and campaigned for the most desirable industry-wide solution.
Yet such solutions are perhaps possible if only the industry would sit down
with environmentalists and government and agree on an accepted framework of
debate.
Many observers accept that life-cycle analyses, which assess environmental
impact from 'cradle to grave', can be an effective tool in determining the
right balance between different packaging products. But such analyses often
run the risk of subjectivity, and there is a need for them to work on an
accepted set of premises.
At present, there is no single packaging industry, according to one leading
supplier, only separate sectors. But there must be one - not only for the
sake of the environment but the future prosperity of the packaging companies
themselves.

FT  28 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Guinness falls after warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, PETER JOHN and CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GLOOMY annual statement from Guinness sent the shares reeling. The
chairman, Mr Anthony Tennant, said growth would not match that 'of a few
years back' and added that there was little sign of recovery in many of the
company's markets. The shares, down 19 at one stage, partially recovered to
finish 9 off at 576p after turnover of 5.6m.
In spite of this despondent tone, Mr Christopher Wickham at Lehman Brothers
remained bullish of the stock, pointing out that the US and UK are not
Guinness's only markets. He suggested there was nothing particularly new in
Mr Tennant's remarks, but noted that the company could expect very good
growth in the expanding drinks markets of Asia and South America.
Life insurer United Friendly was heavily traded as the group's pension fund
sold 12.9m 'B' shares. The sale was prompted by legislation that came into
force in January and demands that investment by a pension fund in its own
company is limited to 5 per cent of the fund's assets.
The majority of the shares were placed with institutions by County NatWest
at 365p apiece and the remaining 1.8m were sold to trustees of the group's
share option scheme. County said the placing was anticipated and well
received and United shares jumped 12 to 372p. The move followed a similar
placing two weeks ago in Britannic, which yesterday gained 2 to 930p.
Utilities may move under the spotlight today as Scottish Power and two water
companies publish their results. The Scottish generator gained 2 to 183p on
high turnover of 4.1m shares, in expectation of a big rise in profits, but
sector analyst Ms Liz Christie at Goldman Sachs said the upside potential is
not there.
It was pointed out in the market that because of earlier criticism about
underpriced utilities the government had set the yield for the Scottish
companies much lower, and that Scottish Power's price/earnings ratio is a
good deal higher than the sector average.
South of the border generators National Power and PowerGen put on 5 to 231p
and 3 1/2 to 239p respectively as the power companies proved a firm feature
in a generally depressed equity market. Volume of 4.6m shares in National
Power and 3m in PowerGen was also very strong.
BZW was bullish of South West Water, which improved 8 to 446p, but North
West Water was steady at 438p, with today's figures from the two companies
the first in the reporting season. Ms Angela Whelan at BZW said South West
was favoured on expectation of good dividend growth after a sensitive
regulatory period, moving the yield nearer to the sector average.
Oils stood out in a dull market as the price of Brent crude held above
Dollars 20 a barrel and securities house Kleinwort Benson predicted that it
would reach Dollars 22 to Dollars 23 in the second half of the year. Opec's
decision to roll over its current oil output limits into the third quarter
of the year will upset the supply-demand balance and tighten the market,
Kleinwort added.
Shell rose 5 to 525p, while BP firmed 2 to 274p on 23m shares traded. Among
the exploration companies, Lasmo was the strongest performer in the FT-SE
100 Index, advancing 6 to 213p. It was further helped by appreciation that
it intends to offload its downstream assets purely by way of an initial
public offering. Enterprise moved ahead 9 to 439p.
Second-line oil companies also performed well, with Ranger prominent after
announcing successful tests at an exploration well off Aberdeen. The stock
forged ahead 19 to 418p.
Midland Bank gained 5 to 409p, reflecting the rising price of shares in
interested bidders HSBC Holdings and Lloyds Bank (up 5 at 432p). TSB eased 2
to 142p in heavy turnover of 6.2m shares on rumours of a broker downgrade.
Property worries continued to overhang Barclays, which fell 9 to 374p.
A sell recommendation on Prudential issued by Robert Fleming contributed to
weakness in the stock, which ended 5 off at 254p.
Warnings from Blue Circle that its cement business was down 10 per cent for
the first four months of the year prompted some analysts to downgrade the
building materials group. BZW shaved Pounds 10m from both its current year
and following year forecasts to Pounds 120m and Pounds 140m respectively.
The shares shed 8 to 256p.
Positive sentiment continued in Vodafone Group, which last week gained
ground after underperforming the sector, and as fears receded about a
possible price war with BT over cellular phones. Yesterday, the shares added
6 at 394p in heavy volume of 8m. Cable and Wireless was also firm, up 5 at
588p, in anticipation of Hong Kong Telecom's results today.
Television and film production company Carlton moved up 19 to 667p,
reflecting half-year results slightly ahead of expectations. Profits for the
six months ending in March rose to Pounds 49.4m from Pounds 46.3m previously
and against forecasts of Pounds 46m to Pounds 48.8m. Carlton also raised its
interim dividend to 6.7p from 6.1p.
Retailer Body Shop slipped 7 to 318p in spite of profits rising, in line
with market expectations, to Pounds 25.2m from Pounds 20m. Mr Andy Hughes,
retail analyst at Nomura, changed his recommendation to hold from sell, on
expectations of a slightly better performance in the UK this year and a
possible doubling of profits in the US.
BOC Group fell 12 to 680p, with talk of a share overhang, and scattered
selling in the chemicals sector, hitting the stock. Courtaulds also
suffered, retreating 11 to 571p.
Worries over fuel costs dented British Airways, off 7 at 300p. Negative talk
from one contractor in the TML Channel tunnel consortium continued to hang
over Eurotunnel, which weakened 10 to 360p. P &amp; O tumbled 13 to 529p on
property worries.
Reckitt &amp; Colman slipped initially on comments by the chairman that the
group saw no sign of an upturn in its main markets. The shares were off 12
at one stage but recovered to close only a penny down at 637p.
Fisons bounced 8 to 357p, with optimism about reapproval for its Opticrom
eye treatment in the US gaining ground.
Fairline Boats fell sharply after the company reported a Pounds 613,000
half-time loss, versus a previous profit of Pounds 2.1m, and a halved
interim dividend. The shares plummeted 103 to 325p.
An agency cross boosted turnover in business services group Hays. A line of
3.6m was crossed at 204p a share and the stock closed firmer at 204 1/2p.

FT  28 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LATE buying and a firmer Wall Street lifted stock index futures yesterday in
moderate volume, writes Christopher Price.
The June contract started with a hangover from Tuesday's poor trade figures,
trailing down from its opening level of 2,705. There was little buying
during the morning session and June traded, at best, at its estimated fair
value premium of 9 points, and often a few points below, reaching its low
point of the day - 2,694 - at mid-day.
However, June's decline brought renewed buying and the afternoon session
brightened the day's trading. Sentiment was helped by a steadier Wall
Street, underpinned by stronger US bonds. June rose gently through the
afternoon, but with a late surge developing towards the close.
It ended at 2,707, six points down on the previous session and around fair
value. Volume was a moderate 7,698 lots. In after-hours' trading, June
continued to improve, with traders predicting a positive start to today's
session.
In traded options, stocks with contract expiry dates yesterday were popular
as traders sought to close positions. Hanson was the most heavily traded
with 3,257 contracts, followed by Lucas with 3,004 and British Airways with
1,694. Total volume was 37,651 lots, up from Tuesday's 28,293.

FT  28 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Interest rate comments keep
Paris in check
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MOST Continental bourses will be closed today for the Ascension Day holiday.
Anticipation of that, and the end of the month left share prices with little
in the way of initiative yesterday, and weakness in Wall Street and Tokyo
overnight was another depressant, writes Our Markets Staff.
PARIS was still affected by comments on Tuesday by the economics minister,
Mr Michel Sapin, suggesting that there would be no immediate cut in interest
rates. The CAC-40 index closed down 15.49 at 2,014.09 in turnover of
FFr2.2bn.
Among banks Societe Generale lost FFr14 to FFr519 while Paribas shed FFr6.0
to FFr409.9 as the chairman noted that the pace of economic recovery would
dictate the group's own performance this year.
Both Eurotunnel and Euro Disney had bad days, the former after comments on
Tuesday by one of its contractors that the project remained under financial
pressure and the latter on news that the theme park has been experiencing
fewer local visitors. Eurotunnel fell FFr1.90 to FFr35.95, and Euro Disney
by FFr2.80 to FFr123.5.
LVMH had another disappointing day, losing FFr76 to FFr4,009. However, Elf
bucked the trend, gaining FFr3.50 to FFr401.9, while Total advanced 10
centimes to FFr267.90 in heavy volume of more than 1m shares. Together the
two oil groups accounted for some 20 per cent of market volume.
Among pharmaceuticals Sanofi declined FFr39 or 3.4 per cent to FFr1,107 on
disappointing first quarter sales in the US of its Ticlid drug.
FRANKFURT eased for the second day running in a continuing consolidation. A
rumour from abroad that the German Chancellor, Mr Helmut Kohl would resign -
denied by Bonn - also hit most blue chip stocks.
But there was little selling pressure as the DAX index closed 12.61 lower at
1,794.05 after a 6.44 fall to 718.82 in the FAZ at midsession. Volume fell
from DM7.6bn to DM5.7bn.
Below the top rank, the chemicals and basic materials group, Degussa, closed
DM8 lower at DM366, reflecting its lower first half sales rather than its
better than expected second quarter earnings. Retailers were generally
weaker than average, Horten falling DM4.50 to DM198 after a management board
member said that earnings and parent company sales had declined in the first
five months of this year.
In banks, Commerzbank closed DM2 lower at DM271 despite higher operating
profits for the first four months of 1992, and hopes of a higher dividend.
Among yesterday's few gainers the tyremaker, Continental, rose DM2.50 to
DM276 as the market waited for a Hanover judicial ruling, perhaps tomorrow,
on the validity of Conti's long-standing limitations on shareholder voting
rights.
ZURICH and STOCKHOLM both closed early ahead of today's holiday, and both
fell. Swiss shares closed broadly lower on quiet business, the SMI index
dropping 10.3 to 1,914.2, and although Swedish banks recovered a little the
Affarsvarlden General index ended 5.3 down at 985.9.
The Swiss cement producer, Holderbank, saw its bearers SFr210 higher at
SFr5,150, topping the active list after Tuesday's forecast of a substantial
upturn, and possibly a higher dividend for the current year.
AMSTERDAM was weaker, the CBS Tendency index finishing down 0.6 at 130.3.
Hoogovens slipped Fl 1.60 to Fl 58.00 on news that it is to cut raw iron and
steel output while Royal Dutch moved up Fl 1.20 to Fl 159.80. The chemical
groups, Akzo and DSM, were hit by the prospect of higher oil prices, losing
Fl 1.10 and 90 cents respectively to Fl 159.10 and Fl 114.90.
MADRID slipped in turnover of Pta10bn, the general index closing 0.89 lower
at 258.01. The half-day general strike set for today is expected to have
scant effect on the market, since the stoppage ends at noon and the Madrid
bourse opens daily at 11am.
BRUSSELS managed a rise in spite of an hour's interruption in trading
because of a bomb alert. The Bel-20 index closed up 3.03 at 1,230.80 in
turnover of BFr919m.
Delhaize was BFr10 higher at BFr8,990 ahead of reporting a rise in first
quarter earnings of 15 per cent while Petrofina eased BFr25 to BFr10,825.
COPENHAGEN's all-share index rose 2.40 to 341.74 on growing expectations
that Danes will vote to ratify the EC Maastricht treaty in their June 2
referendum.
The gains followed an opinion poll on Tuesday evening showing a swing to a
41-39 per cent majority backing the treaty, after a month with a majority of
No votes.
OSLO gained strength from higher oil prices and the all-share index closed
up 2.12 to 449.92 in turnover of NKr542.7m.

FT  28 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Drinks combines see long term growth -
Leading multinationals are taking more of a declining market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It took an unusual combination of war and recession last year to slow the
progress of the international drinks industry's leading multinationals. So
far this year, their relative share performance has declined as investors
have looked for opportunities in short term recovery stocks.
As economic conditions improve, however, the pattern of growth that marked
the international drinks sector in the 1980s should again bring long term
outperformance.
The global trend, summarised in the adage that people are drinking less but
drinking better, is firmly established. Best estimates indicate that the
total volume of spirits consumed worldwide is falling about 1 per cent a
year; but high quality, heavily marketed international brands are growing at
the expense of local products at the rate of 2 to 3 per cent a year.
The process is visible in the most health-conscious western markets, and
particularly in many less developed countries where personal affluence is
increasing and trade barriers are being eroded.
Companies which have benefited most from this trend - and stand to do so in
the future - are those which have assembled strong portfolios of spirits
brands and control marketing and sales through their own worldwide
distribution networks. Research by Barclays de Zoete Wedd (BZW), the London
broker, suggests that such companies should attain organic profits growth of
11 per cent a year.
Guinness and Grand Metropolitan hold the strongest hands. Each has 11 brands
in the top 100. The Guinness portfolio includes the top-selling Scotch
whisky, Johnnie Walker, and the premier gin, Gordon's. GrandMet has
Smirnoff, the leading vodka, and Baileys, the most popular liqueur.
The two companies, which dominate the UK drinks sector, generate the cash
flow which has enabled them not only to strengthen their distribution
systems but to begin reinforcing their prospective profits growth through
acquisitions. In the past year, Guinness has bought such strong regional
brands as Asbach, of Germany, Bundaberg, of Australia, and Pampero, of
Venezuela. GrandMet has purchased a stake in Jose Cuervo, of Mexico, and
taken over Cinzano.
Seagram, with 10 of the top 100 brands, and Allied-Lyons, with eight, have
tended to lag a little behind the pace of the two leaders. In the past year,
however, both have put in radical restructuring programmes to sharpen the
focus of management. Allied's joint venture agreement with Suntory, of
Japan, could have important long term potential. Seagram's investment in Du
Pont has been a valuable cash generator.
Cognac and champagne tend to be the most vulnerable to recession. This
suggests there may be some extra benefit of recovery in the stocks of LVMH
and Remy Cointreau, the French groups.
Each has reinforced its position in the market through alliances. LVMH's
joint venture with Guinness has given it wider, low-cost distribution for
brands which have the highest margins and profits per case in the industry.
Remy's deal with Highland Distilleries has added a leading Scotch whisky to
its portfolio - and its distribution strengths may yet bring in more agency
brands as well as benefits from the integration of Cointreau into the
system.
The earnings outlook for these two groups appears vastly superior to that of
Pernod Ricard. Speculative considerations apart, Pernod Ricard's shares look
overvalued. Its Irish whiskies and Australian wines have given it some
international dimension, but half of its earnings still come from the
stagnating market for aniseed products, and 37 per cent of sales are in
France.
Bols, the Dutch group, in spite of the bias of its business towards liqueurs
and the Netherlands and Italian markets, seems to have a much clearer growth
strategy. Yet it trades at the lowest premium in the Dutch food and drinks
sector.

FT  28 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls below
18,000 on arbitrage unwinding
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONGER crude oil prices, a weaker yen and higher bond yields prompted
profit-taking and arbitrage-related selling of equities and the Nikkei
average fell below 18,000 for the first time since May 6, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average lost 382.08, or 2.1 per cent, to 17,822.56. The index
opened at the day's high of 18,167.10 and fell to a day's low of 17,648.03.
Late afternoon buying by investment trusts helped it recoup some ground.
Volume improved from 209m shares to 300m. Declines overwhelmed advances by
865 to 136, with 120 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section
stocks retreated 19.22 to 1,352.61, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index
eased 3.70 to 1,066.00.
Heavy arbitrage unwinding on the back of a weak futures market, triggered by
institutional selling, depressed the Nikkei. An increasing number of
arbitrageurs are expected to unwind positions ahead of the June futures
contract's expiry next month, since the rollover into the September contract
has been delayed due to low liquidity and prospects of a continuing sluggish
market.
Institutional investors and foreigners were seen selling blue chip
electricals. High-technology companies have been reporting weak results for
the past fiscal year to March, with Japan's five leading computer groups
announcing this week pre-tax profit falls ranging from 43 to 69 per cent.
NEC dropped Y35 to Y956 and Sony Y130 to Y4,080. Mr Barry Dargan, electrical
analyst at James Capel, said investors remained uncertain about the industry
outlook, and some foreign investors, who had bought the issues before the
recent rally, were locking in profits.
Speculative stocks which have been sought by short-term traders and
individuals lost favour. Bio-technology and environmental 'theme' shares
fell on profit-taking, with Morinaga Milk shedding Y19 to Y841.
Low liquidity component stocks of the Nikkei index declined sharply due to
heavy index-linked selling. Shimura Kako lost Y45 to Y640 and Shinagawa
Refractories also Y45 to Y780.
On the bright side, oil and resource-related issues gained ground.
Lion, the detergent maker, jumped Y10 to Y35, a high for the year. Investors
were encouraged by the company's research into production of automobile fuel
from palm oil.
In Osaka, the OSE average weakened 469.75 to 20,441.75 in volume of 17.7m
shares.
Roundup
THE DECLINE in Tokyo had little effect on the rest of the Pacific Rim region
yesterday, with markets generally reacting to domestic influences.
HONG KONG set another record high in spite of profit-taking just before the
close. The Hang Seng index finished 30.62 stronger at 6,082.70, after
touching 6,101.89. Turnover was around HKDollars 6bn.
Rumours that Hutchison Whampoa planned to privatise Cavendish led to the
suspension of both stocks. Parent Cheung Kong climbed HKDollars 1.10, or 4.5
per cent, to HKDollars 25.70.
Other suspensions included Hong Kong Land and HK Macau Developments, on
rumours, confirmed after the close, that the latter was part of a consortium
which had paid HK Land HKDollars 3.8bn for an office development.
HSBC Holdings gained HKDollars 1.25 to HKDollars 46.75 after the bank ruled
out any plan to raise its bid for Midland Bank.
SINGAPORE broke through 1,500 for the first time in three months, the
Straits Times Industrial index rising 12.25 to 1,506.54 in volume of 83.54m
shares.
Banks and property groups registered the largest gains, although a rumoured
interest rate cut did not materialise.
SEOUL's composite index put on 15.72 to 585.23 on reports that the
government would help investment trusts in financial difficulty.
KUALA LUMPUR was weaker as many investors awaited today's listing of Tenaga
Nasional, the electric utility. It has been trading in the grey market at
MDollars 7.60 and some analysts forecast volatile trade today, with reports
that some brokers are short of stock. The composite index dipped 1.32 to
591.20.
MANILA fell on profit-taking after recent gains. The composite index was off
19.08 at 1,421.83 in combined turnover of some 315m pesos, down from 442m
pesos.
BANGKOK was weaker as political unease continued to affect sentiment. The
SET index lost 13.83, or 1.9 per cent, to 715.75 in turnover of Bt4bn.
BOMBAY fell more than 4.5 per cent in volatile trading. The BSE index closed
153.96 lower at 3,144.78.
AUSTRALIA came off an intraday low following half-year results from ANZ
Banking which were in line with expectations. The All Ordinaries index
closed 8.3 easier at 1,665.9 in turnover of ADollars 357.4m.
ANZ firmed 5 cents to ADollars 4.30, but Westpac was 11 cents lower at
ADollars 3.52 following last week's disappointing results. TNT receded 13
cents to ADollars 1.94 after reporting worse than expected nine-month
figures on Tuesday.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: High hopes for Lake Michigan
diamonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN AREA west of Lake Michigan in the states of Michigan and Wisconsin in the
US has a good chance of yielding a world-class diamond mine, said Mr John
Robinson, chief executive of Ashton Mining, yesterday.
Ashton is based in Australia but sees diamond mining as its core business
and will go anywhere in the world to search for the stones. So the company
grabbed with both hands an opportunity to buy 51 per cent of the Great Lakes
diamond project from Dow Chemical, he said. The deal was completed in
January.
Of the 14 kimberlite pipes found by the previous joint venturers in the
project - Dow and Crystal Exploration - 12 had been tested an nine contained
diamonds. 'This means the probability of success is much higher than usual,'
said Mr Robinson.
To put this in context, of the 3,000 known kimberlite deposits in the world,
only 1,000 contain diamonds and only 50 to 60 have ever proved economic.
Ashton draws most of its cash flow and profit from a 38.2 per cent share of
the Argyle mine in Western Australia, in weight terms the world's biggest
diamond producer.
Mr Robinson, in London with Ashton's chairman Sir Leslie Froggatt to talk to
institutional investors, said that in Ashton's view only one of the 12
kimberlite pipes discovered by the Great Lakes venturers had been fully
tested. So priority was being given to drilling the three untested and eight
partly-tested pipes with a view to identifying the various phases of
kimberlite present and testing the diamond content.
Ashton had also used its special skills to re-examine exploration data from
its joint venture in Australia's Northern Territory where it has a 65.4 per
cent interest and where exploration has been going on for 14 years. Mr
Robinson said the results were very exciting. 'The whole perception of the
deposit has changed,' he said. The company had now identified 11 large
diamondiferous targets.
One loam sample collected recently from pipes located about 140 km (85
miles) north of the town of Coanjula contained a broken, commercial-sized
diamond measuring 3mm by 2.7mm by 1.4mm.
Ashton also has gold mining interests and of the ADollars 12m it will spend
on exploration this year, most will go to look for the yellow metal. Mr
Robinson suggested that De Beers' Central Selling Organisation, which
controls 80 per cent of the world's rough (uncut) diamond trade and markets
most of Argyle's gem diamonds, would not put up prices this year. The latest
rough diamond price rise (of 5.5 per cent) was as long ago as March 1990.
But the CSO would probably make an increase early next year, he said.

The New York raw SUGAR market rallied in early trading on technically driven
fund buying, boosting the London raws and whites markets. Buy-stops were
triggered, forcing dealers to cover short positions, as the New York July
contract shot up towards the crucial 10 cents a lb resistance level. 'Funds
really came in above 9.65 and every 10 points it went up found stops - the
locals kept buying it, funds kept buying it, and then trade had to cover
shorts,' one dealer said. Substantial buying by UK trade houses was
reported. 'We thought we might get a blip on the upside but not the activity
we've seen,' said one London dealer. In contrast COCOA came under further
pressure in both London and New York, where by midday July had hit Dollars
855 a tonne - a contract low and the cheapest level for the market in 19
years. Limited offtake from manufacturers has combined with the prospect of
further producer sales to depress the market, dealers said. On the LME base
metals were mainly influenced by the dollar-sterling exchange rate.
ALUMINIUM was most affected by the dollar's firmness and its likely
dampening impact on consumer interest.

   MONTREAL
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EXPORTS OF primary aluminium to the West by the Commonwealth of Independent
States are likely to fall to about 600,000 tonnes, from nearly 1m tonnes in
1991, according to Mr Alfred Pfeiffer, chairman of Germany's VIAG industrial
group.
'That's about the maximum they can move with their production and transport
problems, and they have yet to face the environmental challenge,' he said
during a visit to Montreal. 'We're more optimistic than Alcan Aluminium's
(chairman) David Morton.'
VIAG's biggest single project in North America is the USDollars 1.2bn
Alouette Aluminium smelter at Sept Iles, 1,100 km (700 miles) north-east of
Montreal, on the Lower St Lawrence. Its VAW subsidiary has a 20 per cent
interest and is operator. The plant starts up on June 1 and is expected to
reach target capacity of 215,000 tonnes in 1993. Nearly all the metal will
go to Europe.
Mr Pfeiffer said European demand for primary ingot will gain several
percentage points this year as the metal penetrates further in the motor
industry and elsewhere, helping to bring more price stability. Spot ingot
now trades at about 60 cents a lb.
He said Quebec wanted VAW and partners Austria Metall, Hoogovens,
Kobe/Marubeni of Japan, to push ahead with Alouette Phase II, adding a
further 250,000 tonnes of capacity at a cost of around USDollars 1bn. 'We
will decide in the next two weeks whether to give a contract for preliminary
engineering for Phase II,' he said.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Extracting the benefits from
African oil - Sub-Saharan countries are short of training and investment
capital
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW HILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ANGOLA IS a good example of the oil-producing potential of sub-Saharan
Africa. Endowed with an estimated 4.9bn barrels of recoverable reserves, the
country continued pumping during 16 years of fierce civil war, which
officially ended less than a year ago. Oil kept the Angolan economy afloat.
Now, with new offshore fields being opened to exploration and investment,
and more than 500,000 barrels of crude being produced a day, Angola is
consolidating its position as sub-Saharan Africa's second largest producer,
after Nigeria.
But such 'rich' developing countries have fears too, many of which were
voiced this month in Luanda, the Angolan capital, at an oil and gas
conference aimed at encouraging co-operation between African, Caribbean and
Pacific (ACP) nations and the European Community.
ACP oil producers are worried that a lack of adequate training, a shortage
of international investment capital, and global environmental pressures may
hamper their economic development.
'Countries with large energy resources can't always extract the benefits,'
said Mr Fernando Jose Franca Van Dunen, the Angolan prime minister, in his
opening address. 'If they are not accompanied by technical transfers, and
proper support, more problems, more economic disaster and more poverty can
be provoked. Give us help in drawing up inventories of our resources, teach
us to exploit them rationally and give us some mechanism so we can solve our
balance of payments problems.'
At the same time, developing nations without natural energy resources - the
majority of the 69 ACP countries - are concerned that in a capricious world
oil market they may be hamstrung by their dependence on hydrocarbons. Their
anxiety is well-founded: according to the World Bank, sub-Saharan Africa
spends about one-third of its hard currency earnings on petroleum.
Energy analysts say the concern should not be one-sided. The buzz-word of
the Luanda conference - as at previous EC-ACP gatherings - was
'interdependence'. The developed north will simply store up trouble for
itself for the future if it neglects the energy needs and concerns of the
developing south, which - together with other non-OECD economies - is
exercising an increasing influence over international energy policy. Mr
Quincey Lumsden, a director of the International Energy Agency, warned
delegates that in 10 years' time, important oil crisis management decisions
could be taken beyond the industrialised nations' reach - not in Paris,
where the IEA has it headquarters, but in Beijing, Brasilia or New Delhi.
The EC's ability to meet the concerns of ACP countries with direct action is
limited by its existing political and financial commitments.
ACP oil and gas producers, for example, have long insisted that hydrocarbons
should be eligible for special loans and export earnings stabilisation funds
from the EC. Such assistance is at present provided for most commodities
under the Ecu12bn (Pounds 8.4bn) Fourth Lome Convention - the EC-ACP trade
and aid agreement - but oil and gas are excluded.
Mr Antonio Cardoso e Cunha, the EC energy commissioner, told the Luanda
conference that such wishes - reiterated by Angola's Mr Van Dunen and by Mr
Ralph Maraj, foreign minister of Trinidad and Tobago (the only non-African
ACP oil producer) - 'did not fall on deaf ears'. But realistically, the
European Commission is unlikely to press for changes in the Lome terms to
benefit a dozen developing nations that already have greater natural
advantages than other ACP members.
However, senior commission officials believe existing community initiatives
 -applied both to EC members and to central and east European countries - do
provide examples of ways in which the framework for energy development in
ACP countries could be improved.
Recent draft EC legislation to harmonise criteria for granting oil and gas
exploration licences contains principles that could be applied to ACP
countries. That would ensure equitable conditions for potential
international investors, some of which complained at the conference that the
contract terms being imposed by developing oil producers were too tough.
The European energy charter - designed to help the former Soviet Union and
eastern European states exploit their natural resources - could be extended
or adapted to ACP countries. As the continued desire to invest in Angolan
oil-fields during the civil war indicated, international companies will
continue to drill for oil under the most difficult political circumstances.
But an African energy charter would provide a level of security for
international investors - and reciprocal guarantees for ACP and exploration
companies - which would underpin economic development of the developing
countries.
An ACP-EC working group is now likely to be set up to continue discussion of
the issues raised by the Luanda conference. Improved training is one
fundamental problem that needs to be tackled, particularly in countries,
like Angola, that have suffered severe disruption of regular education. As
one aide to the Angolan energy minister put it during the conference, for
African oil producers 'money is no problem - but there is a whole generation
which has had little education or training'.
Similarly, ACP countries are held back by inefficiency in the refining and
distribution sectors. That pushes up costs in states that do not produce
their own oil, and occasionally forces African exporters of crude to import
petroleum products. Theoretical solutions do not always work in such cases:
ACP delegates pointed out that the break-up of downstream state monopolies
in procurement, refining and distribution - one approach advocated by Mr
Miguel Schloss of the World Bank - is not on its own enough to encourage
investment in decaying infrastructure.
Perhaps the biggest issue the working group will have to tackle is the
question of protecting the environment, which commission officials insisted
should be a priority for the developing countries as it is now for most
industrialised nations. ACP representatives were surprisingly reticent about
the impact an EC energy tax might have on their future economic development.
But there seems little doubt that if the commission's plans announced this
month get the backing of EC members the poorer oil-hungry nations will break
their silence.

privatisation programme
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   LIMA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRIVATISATION OF the Peruvian mining sector got off to a steady but
unspectacular start when the first wholly state-owned mine was sold by stock
exchange auction in Lima. Condestable, a copper mine located some 70 miles
south of the capital, fetched USDollars 1.29m, about two-thirds of its book
value.
The shares, belonging to MineroPeru, were sold as one lot and comprised
around 80 per cent of the total. The remaining 20 per cent had been
distributed to workers under long-standing statutory provisions.
There had been wide initial interest in Tuesday's sale, with half a dozen
potential purchasers, including Marc Rich and the Peruvian Hochschild group,
which owns mines in the area. But only two bidders emerged on the day - one
of them, according to stock market brokers, representing Chilean investors.
The name of the eventual purchaser was not disclosed.
Mining executives say Condestable went cheaply. Even last year, with an
exceptionally unfavourable exchange rate and soaring local costs, it
remained one of a handful of Peruvian mines - and the only one owned by the
state - to notch up a small profit. Miners say its potential is excellent
although new investment is required.
The auction mechanism, however, was agreed to have been a success. Mr Jose
Almenara, stock exchange general manager, said it had worked exactly as
anticipated, ensuring the true market value of the company was reached.
'With all the problems surrounding investment in Peru at this particular
moment, it was a reasonable price,' he said.
MineroPeru has a list of other companies coming up for sale in the near
future. Mr Raul Otero, who presides over its privatisation committee, said
that debt-for-equity swaps would be an 'essential' mechanism for future
privatisation.
At the same time, in New York, Mines Minister Mr Jaime Yoshiyama, was
telling businessmen and bankers at the Americas Society that 'all state
companies will be privatised, whatever the price we obtain'.

Australian wool prices are holding firm after a brief spell of firming. A
distinction is still drawn between better and more stylish wools and the
less reliable types, and it is clear that buyers remain very selective.
There has been a continuing and for important sectors of the wool-consuming
industry a worrying lull in new business, following a widely-experienced
surge in February. The recession still has its impact especially in the UK,
which the important carpet sector depends on housing sales for good demand
on the domestic side.

The International Natural Rubber Organisation council has agreed to form a

pact, officials said yesterday, reports Reuter from Kuala Lumpur.
A decision on whether to renegotiate the current International Natural

three-day council meeting.
'This is significant progress,' said Mr Ahmad Farouk SM Ishak, of Malaysia,
spokesman for producer members. 'The consumers appreciated the seriousness

The present five-year pact, which operates through a buffer stock system,
can be extended by a further two years beyond its scheduled expiry in
December 1993.

THE Mexican Congress has approved changes to make it significantly easier
for foreigners to invest in the country's newly privatised banks.
The government will allow foreigners to buy specially created 'L' shares
with limited voting rights. These can be worth up to 30 per cent of total
voting capital, and if the maximum number is issued, 23.1 per cent of total
capital.
Foreigners have been able to buy 'C' shares, limited to 30 per cent of
voting capital, and, through neutral trusts 'B' shares, limited to 19 per
cent of voting capital. Foreigners could in theory own equity (with limited
voting rights) equivalent to 79 per cent of total voting capital, or 60 per
cent of total capital.
The legal changes are expected to help Mexican banks planning international
equity offerings.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Gilts inch towards a yield
spread link with bunds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOWER bond yields are a notable feature of the UK financial markets since
sterling entered the European exchange rate mechanism in October 1990.
Since the UK currency was pegged to the D-Mark at a central rate of DM2.95,
government bond yields have fallen from around 11.5 per cent to under 9 per
cent at the 10-year maturity.
However, ERM membership has also led to subtle changes in the behaviour of
the gilts market participants.
Investors increasingly watch the relationship between gilts and other
European government bond markets, rather than just the absolute level of
gilts yields.
The most important relationship is the relative yield of 10-year gilts and
German government bunds - the yield spread between the two markets.
Direct comparison is complicated by the fact that gilts carry semi-annual
interest payments, whereas bunds pay annually. Hence gilt yields must be
annualised to give an accurate measure.
On this adjusted basis, the yield spread last week narrowed to around 1.2
per cent, the lowest for many years - probably since the 1960s.
The narrowing of the gilt-bund yield spread since the end of 1990 is an
established trend.
By the autumn of last year, the spread had narrowed to 1.25 per cent, from
more than 2 per cent at the point of ERM entry.
In the run-up to the UK general election on April 9 the yield spread
ballooned to 2.25 per cent, but has since resumed the trend towards
narrowing.
Now analysts are asking whether the yield spread can narrow below the
psychologically important level of 1 per cent and, if so, when.
Among the more bullish firms, Credit Lyonnais forecast that the gilt-bund
yield spread could breach the 1 per cent level in the next month.
In contrast, UBS Phillips &amp; Drew predicted a spread around the current level
of 1.2 per cent by the year end.
However, most analysts agree that the spread should be established between
0.75 per cent and 1 per cent sometime during the next year.
If a tighter, less volatile yield spread is established, gilts prices will
be tied more closely to the performance of the bund market.
Other ERM markets have already passed through this process. For example,
following a rapid fall in bond yields during 1990, 10-year French government
bonds now trade firmly within a 0.50 to 0.75 per cent yield spread over
bunds.
If German bund yields rise, French bond yields tend to follow.
Once the market is convinced a spread has been established, it tends to be
self-supporting. Investors and dealers trade yield spreads; for example,
buying French bonds if the yield spread with Germany widens beyond the
established range.
This does not mean domestic economic fundamentals are ignored. Economic
shocks or political uncertainty can still send French bond prices lower,
regardless of events in Germany.
But the belief of investors in the established yield spread tends to
moderate wild, unilateral swings in bond prices.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Strong support for French franc sector
from investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDERWRITING firms were unable to resist bringing new Eurobond issues in
Canadian dollars and French francs yesterday, despite sluggish market
conditions ahead of a public holiday in most of continental Europe today.
BP America, the US subsidiary of the UK oil group, launched a CDollars 150m
10-year deal, lead managed by Credit Suisse First Boston. The 9 1/2 per cent
bonds were re-offered to investors at a fixed price of par, where the yield
was 80 basis points more than Canadian government paper.
The yield was seen as tight by participants in the deal. A syndicate
official noted BP has a Canadian dollar issue maturing in 1999 which trades
at a yield spread of 110 basis points over government paper.
In addition, BP's Aa3 credit rating from Moody's, the US credit rating
agency, is under review for possible downgrade. This may discourage some
institutional investors from buying the bonds.
Against this, the lead manager said retail buyers would step in to take
paper issued by a well-known and well-liked borrower. The bonds were held at
the fixed reoffer price throughout the day.
The French franc sector continues to find strong support from international
investors. French bonds yield around 60 basis points more than D-Mark paper,
with little or no additional risk since the currencies are linked within the
European exchange rate mechanism.
Yesterday, Credit Commercial de France, the state-backed financial
institution, launched a FFr1.5bn eight-year issue lead managed by its own
capital markets division.
The 9 per cent bonds were re-offered at 99.34, where the yield was 58 basis
points more than French government paper of the same maturity. This was seen
as fair value by participants in the deal and the strong underlying tone of
the market ensured smooth placement.
Elsewhere, Banco di Roma launched a Dollars 200m five-year floating-rate
note issue, lead managed by Sanwa International. The paper pays 25 basis
points above the London interbank offered rate, seen as reasonable by firms
participating in the deal.
The issue is the latest in a spate of dollar FRN issues following months -
perhaps years - of inactivity. Recent borrowers include Banesto, SBAB,
Sumitomo Bank and City of Stockholm.
Bankers said investors were now attracted into floating-rate paper as a
hedge against US interest rates, which may have bottomed out at medium to
long-dated maturities. Meanwhile, financial institutions prefer to take this
form of funding as a natural match for floating-rate assets.
Warburg Soditic, the lead manager, has declared due for immediate repayment
two Swiss franc bond issues by Mountleigh, the UK property developer which
went into receivership on Monday.
A SFr100m straight bond maturing in June and a SFr125m convertible issue due
1997 were called yesterday. Another SFr150m straight bond issue was already
due for redemption yesterday.
The firm has cancelled a bondholders meeting scheduled for June 10, at which
the financial condition of Mountleigh was to be discussed. Bond holders will
have to wait for receivers to liquidate Mountleigh's assets before any
repayments will be made.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: S&amp;P rating aids Turkey's plan
to restructure debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY reached an important milestone in its efforts to restructure its
external debt of about Dollars 49bn when it secured a triple BBB credit
rating from Standard and Poor's.
The rating is a chief component in a debt strategy aimed at reducing
Turkey's dependence on bank loans. It will smooth the process of tapping
international bond markets.
In the long run, the move should curb the volatility in debt servicing, and
improve both the maturity and term structure of its national debt.
Turkey launched a Dollars 150m Eurobond in March. That was the country's
first public bond issue since August 1990. More recently, the Turkish
Treasury issued its first Ecu-denominated Eurobond, a three-year paper worth
Dollars 150m. The rating from S&amp;P now paves the way for the Treasury to
float Dollars 200m of Yankee bonds in US markets this summer. The Treasury
has also mandated a Y30bn Samurai bond issue in Tokyo.
Turkey's outstanding foreign debt, public and private, stood at Dollars
49.2bn at the end of 1991. The public sector is still the largest debtor,
although 1990 saw a sharp rise in private-sector borrowing offshore.
Medium and long-term debt accounts for Dollars 40.1bn. The remaining Dollars
9.1bn represents short-term commercial credits, mostly by the private
sector. About 40 per cent of Turkish borrowing is at variable rates, the
rest at fixed rates.
Official reserves at the end of April stood at Dollars 3.3bn, excluding
gold. That represents less than two months of imports, and compares with
Dollars 4.9bn at the end of 1991, which was already the lowest reserve
figure for three years. However, total international reserves, which include
the commercial banks, appear to have stabilised at about Dollars 11bn.
Mrs Tansu Ciller, economics minister, says that Turkey will need about
Dollars 1bn in total new credit this year.
For the moment, Turkey's foreign exchange position is considered stable.
Tourism revenues, down last year as a result of the Gulf War, are expected
to rebound in 1992 to about Dollars 4bn. Workers remittances, worth about
Dollars 2bn during the year, will pick up in the next few months as Turkish
workers in Germany return for the seasonal Bayram holiday in June.
Difficulties will arise only if Turkey fails to tackle fiscal deterioration.
As the lira is now fully convertible, this could result in a renewed current
account deficit and capital outflows, which would impair Turkey's capacity
to rebuild reserves.
In the first four months of 1992, Turkey has seen a 5 to 6 per cent real
depreciation of the lira against the dollar.
The Treasury's immediate headache is an awkward bunching of repayments.
According to balance of payments figures, Turkey will have to find Dollars
6.89bn in 1992 to service medium and long-term debt, including principal and
interest repayments.
Total debt repayments, including short-term borrowings, are estimated at
about Dollars 7.7bn or 30 per cent of Turkey's exports of goods and
services. The ratio is not projected to decline significantly until 1996.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: ANZ improves to ADollars 135m
and holds dividend
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANZ Group, the Australian trading bank, yesterday reported a modest 5 per
cent increase in net profit to ADollars 135.5m (USDollars 103.4m) for the
six months ended March, 1992, writes Bruce Jacques in Sydney.
Gross income fell 16.4 per cent to ADollars 5.29bn, but the bank reduced bad
and doubtful debt write-offs from ADollars 537.4m to ADollars 382.6m. The
interim dividend is being held at 10 cents a share.
Non accrual, or problem, loans rose to ADollars 3.53bn from ADollars 2.93bn
in the first half of 1990-91. But they have stabilised since September when
they stood at ADollars 3.6bn.
While the results reflect overall improvement, the bank retains several
trouble spots. The result was cut by ADollars 49.6m (ADollars 13.3m
previously) in restructuring costs and the group's Australian banking
business continued to trade at a loss, as did its finance offshoot, Esanda.
Losses from the Australian banking division eased from ADollars 175.6m to
ADollars 140.7m and Esanda declared losses of ADollars 33.8m, compared with
ADollars 2.2m previously.
On the other hand international banking, largely the former Grindlays group,
lifted its contribution from ADollars 116.8m to ADollars 124.1m.
Earlier this week, ANZ directors said they did not anticipate any losses
from bankers' receipt scandals in India where Grindlays has a sizeable
market share.
The statement, which followed a meeting with the Indian Reserve Bank, said
ANZ Grindlays had reconciled all bank receipts held.
The ANZ's New Zealand operation also held their own in the latest half with
a marginal earnings increase from ADollars 43.0m to ADollars 44.8m while
profits from the section termed Australian retail services eased from
ADollars 103.1m to ADollars 71.0m.
Mr Bailey indicated that the company's property portfolio involved loans and
acceptances of ADollars 8.5bn and development ventures of ADollars 700m. The
non-accrual proportion of this exposure was ADollars 1.6bn.
The result brought the company's capital adequacy ratio to 10.8 per cent,
with Tier 1 capital at 6.6 per cent. Stated earnings followed a ADollars
106.1m tax provision (ADollars 104.5m previously) and excluded a ADollars
35.5m abnormal profit (ADollars 24.1m loss previously).
The bank reduced its provisioning against exposure to debt rescheduling
countries in the half from ADollars 479.9m to ADollars 395.8m, with carrying
value approximating secondary market values.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Australia's banks reveal
diverse results - The ripples from Westpac's property write-offs are
spreading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
Seldom has an Australian bank reporting season produced such a diversity of
results. In the space of a few days, six-month results have cast Westpac as
the poor relation, ANZ as the battling improver and the National Australia
Bank as a comfortable top performer.
The banks' experiences with Australia's crop of failed entrepreneurs have
been well-chronicled. The big banks, including the 70 per cent federal
government-controlled Commonwealth Bank, were naturally the most injured by
corporate failures and falling asset values.
But the stock market did not begin to suspect until a few months ago that
one bank out of the big four had performed substantially worse than its
rivals. Its worst fears were confirmed last week when Westpac reported a
thumping ADollars 2.65bn (USDollars 2bn) bad debt write-off.
That pushed Westpac into the first loss in its 175-year history, a ADollars
2.3bn pre-tax deficit and forced the bank to turn to shareholders with
potentially Australia's largest share issue, aimed at raising ADollars
1.2bn.
Worse still, it appears the bank needs the funds to avoid falling below the
Reserve Bank's prescribed capital adequacy ratios later this year when about
ADollars 700m in future tax benefits can no longer be counted as assets for
prudential purposes.
The drama of Westpac's losses, which mainly reflected an overhaul of its
extensive property portfolio, is likely to place the bank at a competitive
disadvantage against its peers for some time to come.
It was a drama singularly lacking from the National and ANZ earnings
reports, which had a strong 'business as usual' flavour. The ANZ and the
National did however appear to react to the Westpac shocks by making a point
of detailing their own more modest property exposures.
The ripples have spread quickly from Westpac's property write-offs, with
Australia's biggest home builder Jennings Industries effectively placing
itself at the mercy of its bankers earlier this week following a total
write-off of its stake in a ADollars 650m Melbourne property development.
Ownership of the project has reverted 100 per cent to Westpac, but the
Jennings write-offs, among other factors have caused its major shareholder,
New Zealand's biggest company Fletcher Challenge, to foreshadow a NZDollars
400m (USDollars 215m) property write-down in the current year.
And yesterday, Australia's second biggest life office, the National Mutual,
had the long-term rating of its finance company lowered from A1 to A3 by
Moody's Investor Services, the US credit rating agency.
'The oversupply of commercial real estate throughout Australia will likely
result in additional property write-downs, further affecting National
Mutual's reserve position,' Moody's analysts said.
While Westpac remains Australia's biggest bank measured by total assets, the
accompanying table indicates its position is far inferior to its rivals on
almost all important counts.
Most notably, the bank's large ADollars 8.19bn problem loan portfolio - more
than the ANZ and the National combined - poses the danger that its
write-offs will remain larger for the next few years.
The National's superior position has resulted largely from its ability to
control its finance offshoot. The National was the only bank whose finance
arm was in the black for the half-year, with its Custom Credit operation
turning a ADollars 68m loss into a ADollars 6.4m profit.
Finance offshoots are where much of the big banks' problems have resided.
Witness Westpac's ADollars 850m capital injection into its Australian
Guarantee Corporation subsidiary which lost ADollars 719m. ANZ's Esanda
operation lost almost ADollars 34m.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Hutchison bids for Cavendish
minorities

<TEXT>
MR Li Ka-shing's Hutchison Whampoa yesterday made a second attempt to take
its associate Cavendish International private, when it unveiled a HKDollars
5.50 a share bid, valuing the company at about HKDollars 16bn (USDollars
2bn).
Analysts said the higher price may just win the day for Mr Li although it
still represented a discount on the company's net asset value of more than
HKDollars 6 a share. Mr Li was surprisingly rebuffed last year when minority
shareholders failed to support a HKDollars 4.10 a share offer for the
company.
Hutchison, which already owns 63.4 per cent of the company, will have to
outlay HKDollars 5.58bn to acquire the minorities. It said its offer
represented a 32 per cent premium over Cavendish's share price prior to the
bid. The company said the proposed consolidation of Cavendish would allow
the Hutchison group structure to be simplified and economies effected.
Cavendish main assets are its 34 per cent of Hongkong Electric Company - the
monopoly supplier of electricity to Victoria Island - 24.5 per cent of Husky
Oil, the Canadian oil and gas producer, and 50 per cent of property
developer ICH.
A merger of the two would give the enlarged Hutchison 49 per cent of Husky.
Mr Li owns 46 per cent of Husky personally. He exercises effective control
over Hutchison and Cavendish through a 39.07 per cent interest in Hutchison
held by his flagship, Cheung Kong.
In March Cavendish reported a 5 per cent fall in net profits to HKDollars
1.25bn - the result of a HKDollars 462m provision for the fall in value of
Husky's oil and gas reserves.
At the end of 1991 Hutchison had net cash of HKDollars 491m and Mr John
Mulcahy, research director at Peregrine Brokerage, said that given its
capital spending commitments in its telecommunication business it may have
to come to the market with a rights issue.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: NM Rothschild to advise on
Hungarian telecom privatisation
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
HUNGARY yesterday appointed NM Rothschild to act as financial adviser to the
privatisation of Hungarian Telecommunications Company (HTC).
The UK investment bank said it would be contacting potential investors
within the next few days. A number of international companies such as BT,
Mercury and AT&amp;T are understood to be interested buyers.
The Hungarian authorities plan to float a significant minority in HTC,
possibly more than 30 per cent. The sale to an industry investor is
scheduled for early to mid-1993. It will be followed by a public offering.
Investment bankers say the HTC privatisation will be the largest in Hungary
and one of the most significant in eastern Europe to date. HTC has an asset
value of Ft132bn (Dollars 1.67bn), and has capital requirements of around
Dollars 600m-Dollars 1bn over three years and Dollars 2bn-Dollars 3bn over
five to 10 years.
The HTC privatisation is driven by the pressure to reverse decades of
neglect with the telecommunications system and bring infrastructure up to
international standards.
Hungary, which has only 10 access lines per hundred inhabitants, compared
with 45 in the UK, is thus aiming to increase the penetration rate by 10 per
cent a year.
NM Rothschild said the undeveloped state of Hungarian telecommunications
offered opportunities for strong earnings growth. Unit volumes would
increase along with line penetration; and efficiency gains would result from
the privatisation's injection of capital.
NM Rothschild won a hotly contested tender to advise on the privatisation
against competition.
The mandate to advise HTC is due to be announced in the coming days.

pre-tax declines

<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Rayon and Teijin, two of Japan's leading synthetic fibre makers,
yesterday reported lower pre-tax profits for the year to end-March.
Mitsubishi Rayon's pre-tax earnings fell by 23 per cent to Y9.5bn (Dollars
73.6m) because of a growing deficit in financial items. Net profit dropped
by 30.8 per cent to Y4.2bn.
It was Mitsubishi Rayon's first profit decline since 1987, and the company
expects earnings to slide further to Y8bn this fiscal year. Net profit is
also predicted to tumble to Y4bn in the current year.
Sales fell by 1 per cent to Y272.5bn due to slow turnover in the non-fibre
business, particularly resins. However, a slight recovery is expected this
year, with sales reaching Y275bn.
Mitsubishi Rayon is to cut back on investments this year because of the
profit downturn. It plans to spend Y17bn on plant and equipment, against
Y27.8bn a year ago.
Teijin blamed its 22.3 per cent fall in pre-tax earnings to Y26.7bn on
stagnant sales of non-fibre products, such as film for audio tapes.
Increased depreciation costs and a deterioration in financial items also
contributed to the decline.
Sales during the last fiscal year rose by 4.1 per cent to Y339.1bn and are
expected to increase to Y350bn this year.
Net profit decreased by 26.7 per cent to Y14.8bn and is expected to fall to
Y11bn.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Daishowa Paper slips into the
red again
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DAISHOWA Paper, Japan's second biggest paper maker, announced a loss for the
second consecutive year.
The company said its pre-tax loss was reduced to Y6.3bn (Dollars 48.8m) from
Y14.9bn the previous year, but it predicted the deficit would increase to
Y13.8bn in the current fiscal year.
Daishowa has been plagued by heavy debts which it incurred during a rapid
acquisition programme abroad in the 1980s, including the purchase of the
Canadian paper operations of Reed International in 1988 for CDollars 631m
(USDollars 530.2m).
Daishowa has been selling assets, including securities and land, in an
effort to halve last year's debt burden of Y450bn by 1996. However, the
recent fall in share prices has meant Daishowa's progress in reducing debts
has been slower than expected.
It repaid only Y5.3bn in debts during the last fiscal year, instead of the
planned Y14bn. Daishowa expects earnings from the sale of securities will be
lower this year, resulting in higher pre-tax losses.
Net income dropped by 76 per cent to Y1.65bn, but remained in the black due
to the disposal of land. Net profit is predicted to slip slightly to Y16bn
in the current fiscal year.
The reconstruction programme has been set back by lower paper prices which
reflect a production glut in the global paper industry.
Sales slipped by 1.3 per cent to Y349.2bn, although Daishowa predicts a
recovery to Y368bn this year.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Kubota hit by higher costs and
weaker tractor sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KUBOTA, the Japanese producer of farm equipment and pipe systems, yesterday
reported a 5.9 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits to Y36.8bn
(Dollars 285.2m) for the fiscal year ended March 31.
The company blamed the decline - its first in six years - on rising
operating costs and weaker overseas sales of tractors and other farm
equipment, especially in Europe and the US.
Sales increased by 1.8 per cent to Y909.2bn, reflecting a 2.5 per cent rise
in domestic revenues. Overseas sales, which account for 16 per cent of the
total, declined by 1.4 per cent to Y144.1bn.
Net income dropped by 41.6 per cent to Y4.2bn because of the liquidation of
its troubled Stardent Computer subsidiary in the US, which brought an
extraordinary loss of Y17.1bn.
On an unconsolidated basis, pre-tax earnings fell by 12.6 per cent to
Y31.7bn.
Sales are expected to rise to Y750bn from Y728.6bn, and net profit to fall
to Y18bn from Y18.5bn.

SOUTHERN, the US utility, is to cut 1,250 jobs this year at its Georgia
Power and Alabama Power units, Reuter reports.
The company said at its annual meeting that it expected compliance with the
clean air act to cost Dollars 2.2bn. Mr Edward Addison, chairman, said, in
answer to a shareholder question, that the cost could be as much as Dollars
3bn.
Mr Addison said additional workforce cuts were a priority. 'There's no
question in my mind, looking at our five operating subsidiaries and Southern
Co Services, that we still have many opportunities to cut out unnecessary
duplication. This is particularly true of the staff support we provide to
our basic business units.'
The company reported on May 26 four months' earnings of Dollars 220m, or 70
cents per share.
Mr Addison said that 'no charges will be brought' in connection with a US
government investigation into investments by the company's pension plans,
through his son, who worked at the investment firm of Kidder Peabody.

PHILIP Morris, the US tobacco and food group, yesterday announced an
additional share buy-back programme which would allow it to purchase up to
Dollars 3bn of shares over a two-year period.
The company still has available more than half its existing Dollars 2bn
facility, launched in November. Together, the two programmes would allow the
company to buy up to Dollars 4.1bn of additional stock.
Philip Morris has strong cash-flows from its highly profitable tobacco
operations. In the past, it has diverted some of this money into
diversification, building up a large food and beverage business, and
subsequently paying down debts taken on to finance the acquisitions.
However, the company has also used spare cash to buy back shares.
On Wall Street yesterday, Philip Morris shares rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars
74 3/4.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Spin-off to split Control Data
in two
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SAN FRANCISCO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROL Data, one of the oldest US computer makers, is to be split into two
independent entities, separating the company's computer products operations
from its computer services businesses.
The company will take a Dollars 400m restructuring charge in the current
quarter.
Control Data's computer systems products operations will be spun off as a
new company, to be called Control Data Systems, while the remaining computer
services operations will be renamed Ceridian Corporation.
Silicon Graphics, a California computer workstation manufacturer, had agreed
to buy a 10 per cent stake in Control Data Systems and NEC of Japan was
considering taking a 5 per cent stake in the new company, Control Data said.
Silicon Graphics and NEC have existing marketing and technology ties with
Control Data.
The division of the company will complete the transformation of
Minneapolis-based Control Data from a computer maker to a services business.
The company was once one of the leading makers of supercomputers and
mainframe computers.
'The separation of Control Data into Control Data Systems and Ceridian is a
major step in the effort to strengthen the businesses and help them grow
faster,' said Mr Lawrence Perlman, president and chief executive of Control
Data. Mr Perlman will become president and chief executive of Ceridian after
the split.
'Control Data Systems will be a significant factor in the expanding
worldwide 'open-systems' market, and Ceridian will be a leading services
company in business and government markets.'
He added that the move should also enhance the ability of Control Data
Systems and Ceridian to attract capital.
Control Data will capitalise the new Control Data Systems company with
Dollars 50m in cash, payable when the spin-off occurs, and an additional
Dollars 45m in cash, payable in December 1992.
Control Data shareholders will receive one share of Control Data Systems
common stock for every four shares of Control Data Corporation they
currently hold.
There will be no ongoing ownership or management relationship between the
two companies after the spin-off, although they will continue to provide
products and services to each other over a transition period.
Control Data said about Dollars 115m of the charges were associated with
Control Data Systems' plans to continue a transition from proprietary
products to 'open systems' based on industry standards.
The balance of the Dollars 400m charges reflects an anticipated loss and
related costs of Dollars 55m in connection with the sale of the company's
Automated Wagering business, and provisions of around Dollars 55m for
property lease obligations.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR RUPERT Murdoch's Fox Broadcasting, an independent US television network
founded five years ago, will challenge the traditional networks by expanding
its programming schedule in September from four to six nights a week.
The network also plans to expand to seven nights a week of programming next
winter, when it adds an evening of movie programming.
Fox, a division of Mr Murdoch's News Corporation, has managed to take on the
existing big three networks - ABC, NBC and CBS - with a brash formula of
successful drama, comedy, and tabloid shows. Last year Fox garnered more
than 8 per cent of the US television audience share.
The plan adds 11 new shows, increasing Fox's prime time programming from 10
to 14 hours a week. That is still below the 15 hours weekly level which,
under US regulatory guidelines, allows Fox to profit from the syndication of
shows. Other networks are prevented from syndicating as they exceed 15 hours
weekly.
Fox was founded under the management of Mr Barry Diller, who resigned
recently as chairman of Fox Inc, the parent of the network and Hollywood
studio.
Mr Murdoch assumed a more hands-on role at Fox after Mr Diller's departure.
He is keen to prepare for a greater challenge for his fledgling network.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: BP Chemicals sets up alliance
with EniChem
</HEADLINE>

   ROME, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Petroleum Chemicals and EniChem, the Italian chemical group,
yesterday announced the formation of a broad strategic alliance.
The groups have formed a study team to discuss possible synergies in their
polystyrene and styrene businesses with a view to setting up a joint
venture. Both groups are small manufacturers in a sector which offers
considerable economies of scale.
Together the companies would have a capacity of about 300,000 tonnes a year,
according to Chem Systems, the chemical industry consultants. That would
place them fourth in Europe, behind BASF of Germany, Dow of the US and
France's Elf Atochem.
Yesterday's agreement will allow EniChem to go ahead with a new plant at
Brindisi employing BP Chemical's gas process to produce 200 tonnes a year of
high and low density polyethylene.
The agreement ends a long search by EniChem to find a technology partner in
the field and marks a further success for BP Chemicals which has already
sold 17 different licences of its gas process.
EniChem has already tried to set up agreements with other companies in
number of product areas, including ICI of the UK in vinyls and Arco of the
Netherlands in engineering plastics.
EniChem had considered in addition to BP an arrangement with its old rival
Montedison. Through its US subsidiary Himont, Montedison has developed
exciting but unproven technology for the production of polyethylene. Another
strategy considered by EniChem was a broad alliance with Union Carbide
allowing this US group a significant foothold in Europe. But this now seems
less likely, EniChem opting instead for sectorial international links.
EniChem recorded a loss of L742bn (Dollars 619m) in 1991, blamed on weak
prices, slack demand and heavy financial charges. A 1991-4 business plan -
rationalising both plant and the work force - was held up by political
objections to job losses and lower investment in the south. A watered down
version was only approved late last year and EniChem remains well behind its
main international rivals in reacting to the changing conditions of the
chemical-petrochemical industry.

FT  28 MAY 92 / International Company News: Italians may buy Del Monte Foods
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS are under way for the sale of Del Monte Foods, the US tinned
foods group formerly part of RJR Nabisco, to Cragnotti &amp; Partners Capital
Investment (C&amp;P), the Italian financial concern trying to create a new
international operation in the foods sector.
Some industry sources said a preliminary agreement could be ready for
signing next month but others suggested that the deal was not so advanced.
A Dollars 300m price tag was put on Del Monte in an Italian newspaper report
yesterday but the full price, including assumption of debt, seems likely to
be significantly higher if a deal goes ahead.
Under the broad outlines of the deal, confirmed by C&amp;P yesterday, the
Italian company would take control of Del Monte through the transfer of its
recently-acquired Cica tinned foods subsidiary in Brazil, as well as the
purchase of a direct stake. Part of the enlarged Del Monte group would then
be floated in the US.
Del Monte Foods was created in 1988 after the leveraged buy-out of RJR
Nabisco by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts, the US buy-out specialists, as one of
four divisions of the original Del Monte company, which had been acquired in
1978 by R. J. Reynolds.
In 1990, Del Monte Foods, based in California, went through a further change
of ownership after a Dollars 1.54bn Merrill Lynch-backed management buy-out.
Since then, further disposals have taken place. However, sales for the San
Francisco-based business amounted to Dollars 1.4bn last year.
C&amp;P denied that a planned L250bn (Dollars 206m) bond issue was also destined
to finance the transaction. The Italian company, headed by Mr Sergio
Cragnotti, a former chief executive of the Ferruzzi group, was set up in
early 1991 with L450bn in launch capital. Its aim is to establish three
international areas of operation in the foods, detergents and packaging
sectors.
Acquisitions so far have concentrated on packaging. In March 1991, it took a
majority stake in Lawson Mardon, the Canadian packaging group, and six
months later bought 50 per cent of the Ja-Mont paper joint venture.
The purchase of Cica late last year was its first venture on the foods side.
C&amp;P has been negotiating with Del Monte's management and owners for some
months, and is now thought to be the only company in the running to buy the
company, which is now owned by a consortium including management and Merrill
Lynch, the US investment bank.

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Cosalt tumbles to Pounds 778,000
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The recession continued to depress markets and margins at Cosalt, the
diversified south Humberside-based group.
Pre-tax profits amounted to Pounds 778,000 for the six months to March 1,
down 23 per cent on the previous Pounds 1m. Turnover came to Pounds 40.5m
(Pounds 39.9m).
Mr Edward Brian, chairman and chief executive, expected profitability to be
much stronger in the second half, in keeping with recent tradition.
Profit included Pounds 167,000 (Pounds 106,000) from sale of surplus
premises. Earnings per share came to 4.52p (5.9p) and the interim dividend
is again 4.25p.

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Loss and dividend cut sinks Fairline shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Fairline Boats, the leisure power boat group, yesterday lost a
quarter of their value after falling demand pushed the Peterborough-based
group into losses and forced a cut in the interim dividend.
In the six months to end-April, Fairline incurred a pre-tax deficit of
Pounds 613,000, against profits of Pounds 2.1m, on sales down 36 per cent at
Pounds 12.3m.
The interim dividend is halved to 3.575p as earnings per share of 41.9p gave
way to losses of 11.8p. The share price fell 103p to 325p.
'People need to start making money in the their small businesses again for
demand to pick up,' said Mr Sam Newington, chairman.
While there were signs of renewed interest, the turn down in the German
economy, where the group had 30 per cent of its sales, was worrying.
The fall in demand had been most noticeable in the smaller boats and
appeared to be internationally spread. According to Volvo, there had been a
60 per cent decline in marine engine sales in the US and a 40 per cent fall
in Europe since 1988.
Demand for the most expensive models, costing about Pounds 600,000, was most
resilient.
Mr Newington said he was also concerned about changes to European Community
VAT rules. From next January, anybody buying in one EC country and exporting
it to another will no longer be able to claim VAT exemption.
Member state governments would individually decide whether to levy VAT on
boats already based in their countries, a move which would lead to
disruption in the market.
The net cash balance was nearly halved from Pounds 3m at the same period
last year before taking into account the June tax payment.
Mr Newington said the group was not altering its strategy of having gone up
market with larger boats. In the short term there was no option but to
batten down the hatches and wait for the recession to pass.

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: 7% rise pushes Carlton over Pounds 49m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CARLTON Communications, the television production and services group,
announced slightly better than expected pre-tax profits of Pounds 49.4m for
the six months to end-March.
Mr Michael Green, chairman, said the group had 'confronted successfully'
trading conditions which he described as uncertain and demanding.
Analysts are suggesting full year profits of some Pounds 103m. The shares
rose 19p to 667p.
Carlton, which takes over the London weekday licence, the largest in the ITV
system, from Thames on January 1, produced a a 13 per cent increase in
turnover to Pounds 324.7m; profit showed a 7 per cent rise over the
corresponding Pounds 46.3m.
Earnings per share rose by 11 per cent to 16.85p (15.13p), and the interim
dividend is increased 10 per cent to 6.7p (6.1p) reflecting Mr Green said,
'a cautious reaction to a welcome recovery in our main markets.'
Mr Green said the group remained financially strong with net cash of Pounds
146m, excluding the indebtedness of Pickwick, the video group acquired in
March.
The group also announced yesterday that Sir Derek Birkin, chairman of RTZ,
will become a non-executive director from the beginning of June.
Mr Green had long been an admirer of the business skills of Sir Derek, who
has in the past attended an occasional Carlton board meeting in an informal
capacity and provided background advice on big deals.
Video and audio production and distribution increased pre-tax profits to
Pounds 20.4m (Pounds 12.5m). Growth was expected in the second half as
Hollywood studios moved towards announcing their latest 'sell-through'
videos in advance. That, Carlton said, would help planning at its
Technicolor subsidiary.
Profits at video and sound products - the sophisticated editing and
recording equipment provided by subsidiaries such as Quantel and Abekas  -
fell from Pounds 9.2m to Pounds 8m, but were up on the preceding six months.
Television and film services produced flat profits at Pounds 13.7m.
Mr Green said last night he was not over-concerned if Premier League
football was shown live on Sky Television next season. ITV would still show
quality football.
'We know how to operate in competitive markets. If Sky is showing a London
derby match we will not be scheduling Sooty against it,' Mr Green said last
night.

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Guinness will pay pension to Saunders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ANTHONY Tennant, out-going chairman of Guinness, the UK-based
international drinks group, yesterday confirmed that the company was
prepared to pay a pension to Mr Ernest Saunders, its former chairman and
chief executive who was jailed for theft and false accounting.
But he refused to be drawn on the size of the pay-out, which is still being
negotiated. It is understood Mr Saunders, 57, will be paid between Pounds
70,000 and Pounds 80,000 a year. This compares with his salary before he was
dismissed in January 1987 of Pounds 225,000.
Mr Tennant, replying to a shareholder's question at the company's annual
meeting, said: 'Mr Saunders is entitled to a pension in respect of his
period of service with the company. He is also entitled to apply for early
payment. It is company policy that the details are confidential as far as
the company is concerned.'
Mr Tennant gave a mixed forecast for the current trading year. He repeated
cautious comments made with the preliminary results on slower profits
growth, but said Latin America and south-east Asia would grow rapidly in the
next five to ten years.
The shares fell 18p to 567p as the market seemed to overstate Mr Tennant's
caution. They later recovered to 576p.
In Mexico, United Distillers, its spirits arm, had continued the process of
acquiring distributors with the purchase of Inter-American Holdings,
distributor for the Johnny Walker, Old Parr and Buchanan whisky brands.
Mr Tennant, who was brought in from Grand Metropolitan to restore the
group's reputation following the fall of Mr Saunders, is to retire at the
end of this year. He will be replaced by Mr Tony Greener.
Yesterday also marked the ending of an era as the Earl of Iveagh, the only
remaining member of the Guinness family on the board, retired. It is the
first time in the company's 233 year history the family has not been
represented.

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Fresh doubts on payment to Davy holders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BOLGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Former shareholders of Davy Corporation seem little closer to receiving
their second payment of Pounds 54m in spite of a deal concerning Emerald
Producer, the floating oil production facility which cost Davy its
independence.
Trafalgar House, the property, construction and engineering group which took
over Davy, said yesterday it had reached an agreement with Midland and
Scottish Resources, the oil company which ordered the rig from Davy.
Trafalgar will lease the Emerald to MSR for Dollars 65,000 (Pounds 37,000) a
day.
Trafalgar made the second payment to Davy shareholders, worth 45p a share,
conditional on it receiving payment for the Emerald from MSR, which so far
has been unable to draw on letters of credit, which expire on June 30.
Trafalgar believes it remains unlikely that MSR will be able to get the
necessary certification before June 30, or have the deadline extended.

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Dowty claims TI's accounting methods
exaggerate earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DOWTY GROUP, the aerospace and specialist engineering company fighting a
hostile Pounds 494m bid from TI, yesterday launched a sweeping attack on its
aggressor's accounting techniques, which it said were at the very boundary
of acceptable practice.
Dowty said the accounting treatment exaggerated the true level of the
engineering company's earnings per share and the quality of its management
and, as a result, gave Dowty shareholders an inaccurate impression of the
quality of the shares they are being asked to accept.
In a letter sent yesterday to TI's shareholders, as well as its own, Dowty
says that not only was the cash alternative of 175p a share inadequate, but
that the value of TI and its future was uncertain.
TI said the letter looked like a smokescreen. 'An increasingly desperate
Dowty is trying to divert attention away from its own shortcomings and the
real issues of the bid,' the company said.
TI has dismissed Dowty's claims about its accounting as the raking over of
old issues which shareholders have fully understood for some time.
It says Dowty shareholders are being offered a fully underwritten cash
alternative and that in any case TI no longer utilises the particular
accounting practice which the City roundly criticised in 1989.
Dowty, however, says shareholders may not have fully understood the
implications. In its letter, it says TI has 'boosted its earnings record
effectively by charging costs against reserves'. This had helped TI report
earnings growth from 29.6p in 1987 to 44.8p in 1991.
Specifically Dowty concentrates on 'retrospective' goodwill write-offs,
including a Pounds 52m provision taken in the 1989 accounts which related to
the acquisition of Bundy in the US the previous year.
Dowty says these provisions against the balance sheet led to 'low quality
earnings' as they related to costs that should have been taken through the
profit and loss account.
Dowty then restated what it calls TI's 'hard core' earnings in a way it says
is consistent with how most other companies report. It concludes that TI
actually increased its earnings only from 28p to 30.5p over the past five
years, a rise of 8 per cent, rather than the 51 per cent it actually
reported.
The scale of TI's provisioning at the time of acquisitions also meant that
its assets had hardly grown over the five year period, Dowty said. It was
very unusual for an engineering company to have such little asset backing.
In order to continue this deceptive earnings growth TI needed to make
another acquisition. Without an acquisition, TI would be left with only
Pounds 16m of provisions against acquisition costs and would soon be left
with no opportunity to take costs against reserves, Dowty says.
The attack on TI's accounting policies marks the beginning of the last 10
days of the bid before it closes on June 10 and an intensive round of
presentations to institutional shareholders.

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Improved margins help Mid Kent rise to
Pounds 7.2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MID KENT Holdings, the water supply company whose 250,000 customers have
endured a hose pipe ban for more than three years, yesterday announced an
effective 16 per cent increase, to Pounds 7.2m, in pre-tax profits for the
year to March 31.
Turnover increased by some 15 per cent to Pounds 29.1m, mainly due to
average price increases of 18.7 per cent.
These were based on Mid Kent's K number - the percentage above the rate of
inflation prices can be increased - of 9 per cent.
High K numbers were allowed by Ofwat, the industry regulator, to make water
companies needing large capital expenditure programmes attractive to
investors. Next year Mid Kent's K number will fall to 2.5 per cent.
Mr Bob Atwood, finance director, said operating margins improved from 15 per
cent to 21 per cent, reflecting cost improvements.
Net interest receivable fell to Pounds 1.15m (Pounds 2.38m) due to lower
interest rates and a Pounds 2m reduction in net cash to Pounds 26m.
Earnings were 31.7p. The company is recommending a final dividend of 5p to
make a total distribution of 9.5p.
Because of the change in year end, no comparative figures were given,
although the dividend is effectively 12 per cent higher.

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Dartmoor seeks Pounds 8.05m as net asset
value falls 25%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DARTMOOR Investment Trust is raising Pounds 8.05m net via a rights issue and
placing of debenture stock.
The trust also announced a 25 per cent fall in net assets per share over the
year to April 30.
Dartmoor is part of the stable run by Ian Henderson Associates and invests
mainly in income shares of split capital trusts. Income shares have been hit
in recent months reflecting a belief that corporate dividend growth will be
slow in the 1990s.
In the 1-for-5 rights issue, 4m shares are on offer at 122p each with a
warrant attached, entitling holders to subscribe for one new share at 118p
over the next 10 years. In addition, the company is placing a further Pounds
3m nominal of the index-linked debenture at 114 1/2 p.
As of April 30 the net asset value per share was 90.12p, down from 120.45p
at end-April 1991. Asset values have increased in May and the rights issue
will also have the effect of increasing the value to 97.58p.
A maintained fourth interim dividend of 3.8p makes a total of 11.2p (10.8p)
for the year. If the rights issue proceeds, the trust expects to be able to
pay dividends of 11.6p in the current year.
Earnings per share were 11.5p (13.85p).

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Restructured Casket surges to over Pounds
2m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWO YEARS of restructuring at Casket, the bicycle and clothing supplier,
came to an end yesterday with a surge in annual pre-tax profits, from Pounds
212,000 to Pounds 2.06m, on sales ahead only 2 per cent to Pounds 71.9m.
The share price - which has risen from 19p at the beginning of April - was
shaved by profit-taking to fall  1/2 p to 31p.
Mr Joe Smith, chief executive, said the group was now looking for a third
business to 'turnround' in a similar fashion. Any acquisition was likely to
be done for paper, he added.
Casket, which struggled to placate shareholders unhappy with deepening
losses in 1990, had sold seven loss-making businesses and closed three since
the new management team arrived. The group took an Pounds 886,000
extraordinary charge in the year to March 31 for the closure of Cleancut
Clothiers, its trouser business.
'We are now well placed to take advantage of our much stronger financial and
trading positions,' Mr Smith said. Net debt had been cut from Pounds 7.95m
to Pounds 5.6m, with gearing of 46 per cent. Interest cover was 2.25 times,
Mr Smith said.
During the year, Casket increased its share of the UK cycle market to more
than 20 per cent with the purchase and revival of Falcon Cycles. . It had
been losing Pounds 1m a year when purchased in January.
The cycle division overall increased sales from Pounds 19.7m to Pounds 30.7m
 -of which Pounds 2.4m came from Falcon - and operating profits by 38 per
cent to Pounds 2.4m.
Casket increased exports by 70 per cent in the last year - representing some
10 per cent of turnover - with strong demand from continental Europe for its
brands, which also include Townsend and British Eagle.
The clothing division held operating profits at Pounds 1.3m, on turnover up
15 per cent at Pounds 39.5m.
The dividend is raised to 0.5p (0.2p) - with a final of 0.35p - and is 3.8
times covered by earnings of 1.9p (0.4p).

FT  28 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Prudential cuts cash bonuses for executives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDER a new share scheme for senior executives of the Prudential, the UK's
largest life assurance company, the maximum bonus receivable in cash has
been reduced from 50 per cent to 15 per cent of basic salary.
Shareholders were told the details at yesterday's annual meeting.
The change has been made following a row last year about the remuneration
received by Mr Mick Newmarch, chief executive. It involves a 40 per cent
reduction in bonuses and an even sharper fall in the amount of the bonus
receivable in the form of cash.
Sir Brian Corby, chairman, explained that the aim was to 'link the
remuneration of senior executives to long-term performance.'
If recipients choose to buy Prudential shares with their bonus the company
will match the amount with an equal number of shares. These extra shares,
however, cannot be sold for at least five years.

of Expro
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FLEXTECH is leaving the oil business which carried it to the USM just nine
years ago in favour of children's television.
The company yesterday announced a Pounds 55.3m management buy-out of Expro,
its Aberdeen-based oil services subsidiary.
Shareholders will get a piece of the action through a complicated deal which
allows Flextech to pay Pounds 41.6m - amounting to 120p per share - in place
of a dividend.
The agreement is structured so shareholders, rather than the company, will
pay tax on the sum.
Mr Roger Luard, Flextech director, said the company would retain Pounds 14m
of the proceeds to pay off debt and fund development of media interests. The
main holding, an indirect 50.1 per cent stake in The Children's Channel,
showed losses of Pounds 3m last year.
Mr Luard said Flextech intended to concentrate on the opportunities for
children's and family programming in the growing satellite and cable
markets. By 1995 in the UK alone, he said, it was estimated that there would
be between 8m and 9m cable subscribers, compared with just 500,000 this
year.
The Expro purchase was backed by CINVen, the venture capital group.

British Steel and Avesta, the Swedish stainless steel group, are close to
agreement on creating one of the world's largest stainless steel producers
with annual turnover of about SKr13bn (Pounds 1.2bn) and production of
700,000 tons.
Avesta said it hoped the deal would be completed by early next month,
although British Steel said that discussions about possible collaboration
were at a preliminary stage.
British Steel said it was not possible to provide any details about the
nature of any partnership as the talks had not yet reached that stage.
Any new conglomerate is likely to be jointly owned by the two companies,
though Avesta added the talks were based on the assumption that it will
remain an independently listed company. Sir Robert Scholey, chairman of
British Steel, is understood to be playing a leading role in the talks.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Ten banks put up Pounds 25m to build foreign exchange
trading system
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN LEADING banks in the foreign exchange markets are to put up Pounds 25m
(Dollars 45m) to build a new electronic trading system to rival Reuters, the
UK information group which dominates foreign exchange trading.
The 10, from the US, UK and Switzerland, have been planning the development
of the trading system, known as Electronic Broking Service (EBS), for two
years. EBS, which is planned for launch early next year, follows Reuters'
own Dealing 2000-2 service, launched a month ago and in use at 23 banks.
Both are intended as substitutes for the brokers who act as middlemen in
around 40 per cent of foreign exchange deals. Electronic broking systems,
which replicate the work of human brokers, are estimated to cut broking
costs to around a quarter of their current level.
Commissions paid to these brokers are one of the largest costs faced by
banks in the foreign exchange market. One leading British bank says its
commissions last year totalled around Pounds 8m.
The banks involved in EBS are Barclays, Midland and National Westminster of
the UK; Bank of America, Chemical Bank, Citibank and J P Morgan of the US;
and Credit Suisse, Swiss Bank Corporation and Union Bank of Switzerland.
Each is putting up an equal share in the investment, with Quotron, the
information services company owned by Citicorp of the US, providing a
similar stake. Quotron will build EBS, which will be based on its
recently-launched F/X Trader dealing system.
The development of EBS reflects in part the banks' concern at Reuters'
dominance of the foreign exchange markets. From its foothold in supplying
prices, the company succeeded in capturing around 50 per cent of all foreign
exchange deals with its last generation of dealing terminals. Many banks
privately complain about Reuters' charges.
A third electronic broking system, Minex, is planned by KDD, the Japanese
telecommunications firm, with the backing of Japanese banks.
Reuters said yesterday that Dealing 2000-2, which had suffered delays and
was finally launched last month after several years in development, was
performing well and meeting all expectations.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Rolls-Royce management changes named at bitter AGM
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR RALPH Robins, Rolls-Royce chief executive, is to succeed Lord Tombs at
the end of September as executive chairman of the UK aero-engine and
industrial power group.
The announcement at the company's annual meeting was overshadowed by bitter
interventions from former employees and shareholders over the group's
handling of its voluntary redundancy scheme.
Lord Tombs, 68, also said Mr Terry Harrison, head of the company's
industrial power activities and former chairman of Northern Engineering
Industries (NEI) which Rolls-Royce took over in 1989, will become the new
chief executive. Sir Ralph, who has spent his entire working life with the
company, had long been regarded as the natural successor to Lord Tombs.
But company directors faced embarrassment yesterday when small shareholders
at the meeting voted against a resolution to enable directors to amend the
company's executive share option scheme. The proposal, to allow the granting
of options at a price 15 per cent below the current market value of
Rolls-Royce shares, will now be put to a ballot.
The vote against the share option scheme reflected the feeling among many
former employees and shareholders over the redundancy scheme and the
company's approach to job cuts.
Rolls-Royce cut about 5,000 jobs last year and has announced a further 3,000
job reductions this year to reduce costs and counter the slowdown in the
commercial engine market and the decline in military business.
Employees, who accepted the company's initial voluntary redundancy package
last year, said they had lost out because Rolls-Royce introduced a more
attractive package last July.
Sir Ralph acknowledged the reaction on the job issue yesterday had been
stronger than expected but said the company had to cope with the reduction
in defence business and the short-term problems in the competitive civil
engine sector.
He also said most Rolls-Royce directors have not had a pay increase for the
past 18 months. Lord Tombs took a pay cut to Pounds 156,000 last year from
Pounds 180,000 the year before.
Lord Tombs is stepping down after seven years as chairman during which he
successfully piloted the company through privatisation in 1987, expanded the

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It might seem churlish, but the obvious conclusion from Body Shop's annual
results is that the group is no longer growing fast enough to justify the
aggressive rating of its shares. Pre-tax profits rose by more than a
quarter, but the admission that the UK market is three or four years away
from saturation was a timely reminder that mere size can be a hindrance to
spectacular performance.
Granted, there remains huge scope in the US, where the group's retailing
formula seems to work. But development there will take years, and plenty can
go wrong along the way. Even after their 16 per cent underperformance of the
market this year, the shares look ambitiously priced on a current year
multiple of 29. It will doubtless take more than ventures into wind farms
and corporate videos to stop the multiple gradually drifting back to more
realistic levels.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
At almost 6100 the Hang Seng Index is already beyond earlier expectations
for the year end, which ought to be reassuring for the bears. The problem is
a surfeit of good news, not least confirmation yesterday that a group of
Chinese investors is paying HKDollars 3.8bn for a slice of central Hong Kong
real estate. This is a hefty price, valuing each square foot of office space
at a 50 per cent premium to what was previously thought achieveable, and
implying a HK Land net asset value of HKDollars 20 per share.
More to the point, if friends of the colony's future governing power are
prepared to pay top prices at this stage, is it not fair to assume that the
People's Republic will hardly seek to damage the investment come 1997? It is
that very perception, of course, which has encouraged a huge flow of
international money into Hong Kong this year. Any narrowing of the China
discount, however, obviously leaves the market vulnerable to shock.
On a different scale, yesterday's move by Mr Li Ka-Shing's Hutchison Whampoa
to buy out the Cavendish minority should also be positive. The HKDollars
5.50 per share offer is not exactly a knock-out blow, but the hope is that
the transaction presages an overdue streamlining of some of Mr Li's
operations. Both Hutchison and Mr Li's top company Cheung Kong have
substantially underperformed the market over the last 12 months. The
latter's rating has suffered from a series of diversifications away from
property. By taking Cavendish private Hutchison is in a better position to
dispose of its ill-fated investment in Husky Oil, though a more urgent
priority might be to reduce gearing by selling the 34 per cent stake in Hong
Kong Electric.

FT  28 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: US economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Judging by yesterday's improved durable goods orders for April, the US
economy could yet ride to the rescue of Mr George Bush's hopes for
re-election. The figures add to the broadening range of evidence that the US
recession ended shortly after Christmas. Granted, the series is volatile,
and the headline 1.4 per cent monthly increase can be variously adjusted for
defence and transport orders to paint a less impressive picture. Indeed,
non-defence capital goods orders fell slightly. But the trend looks clear
enough: the economy has been making a steady, if unspectacular, recovery.
Hence, perhaps, the refusal by both bond and equity markets to react
decisively. The fundamentals apparently preclude a re-run of last year's
abortive recovery, not least because interest rates are so much lower, but
no-one is expecting the economy to forge ahead. There will have to be
something unexpected among next week's rush of data if Wall Street is to be
jolted from its present mood of restrained optimism. As for the bond market,
it may have brushed off yesterday's figures, but it had already fallen on
Tuesday's confidence indicator and is unwilling to break out of its present
trading range.
In marking the dollar up yesterday, the foreign exchange market was probably
right to think that the Federal Reserve will find it difficult to cut
interest rates further, especially as the rising oil price implies new
inflationary pressure. Equally, the Fed is unlikely to risk strangling
recovery by raising rates in advance of the election. Interest rate
differentials with Germany are unlikely to be very different a few months
from now.

FT  28 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Cadbury's soft centre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There is something touchingly naive in the Cadbury Committee's faith in a
self-regulatory system of corporate governance. According to Sir Ron
Dearing, former chairman of the Post Office, it is preferable to legislation
which is obeyed to the letter but not in spirit. The Cadbury report is full
of spirit, but the letter of its proposed code is frequently blurred,
partly, one suspects, because the great and the good who compiled it do not
wish to be inconvenienced by too much change.
Little fear must attach to the implicit threat of stock exchange de-listing
for companies which fail to disclose their level of compliance. Hardly ever
has the exchange had recourse to such a sanction, which would, incidentally,
make it harder for investors to sell their holdings.
Nor are the proposed rules always as hard and fast as they look. The
committee is reluctant to insist on separation of the chairman and chief
executive roles, presumably because a unified post has worked well at
companies like Grand Metropolitan. Directors have only to state that they
have a 'reasonable expectation' that their company will continue in
operation. The issue of rotation of auditors is ducked. There is no
guarantee of legislation to protect auditors who report suspicion of fraud
to the authorities. In any case that is not such a dramatic proposal: the
authorities were slow to latch on to the BCCI scandal despite the existence
of such protection for auditors of banks.
Doubtless a latter-day Robert Maxwell would make mincemeat of the
committee's efforts to strengthen the role of non-executive directors.
Admittedly, the code does give shareholders more ammunition to insist on
their rights as owners. That they are currently in a mood to do so was
evidenced by yesterday's acrimonious exchanges over executive share options
at the Rolls-Royce annual meeting. Whether they would be similarly militant
in a boom is another matter.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Letter: German solution to lack of UK apprenticeship
opportunities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD S C JARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Richard Trim (Letters, May 26) is correct to express concern over
the lack of graduate apprenticeship opportunities in British industry.
Before I graduated two years ago, I, like many other students, spent a
considerable amount of time trying to find a satisfactory apprenticeship
(management trainee) programme within the British manufacturing industry -
unfortunately without success. I had studied business and wanted to move
into the manufacturing sector, but due to such a marked lack of interest in
business students, I eventually decided to move outside of the UK. My
endeavours led me to Germany, where I am now in the process of finishing my
apprenticeship with a well-known Bavarian automobile manufacturer.
My trainee programme has been very carefully planned, I have enjoyed many
opportunities, and have learnt a great deal. When I consider the lack of
response and enthusiasm shown by the manufacturing sector at 'career days'
and through our 'careers advisory service' at university, I realise that I
had no other choice but to leave the UK in order to receive a proper
training, and I am not atypical.
This is a shame, and perhaps should be a cause for concern in the British
manufacturing industry.

Sir, Lord Cobbold's idea of a merger between the pound and the franc,
referred to by Anthony Harris ('When gentlemen prefer bonds', March 26), has
financial precedents as well as being a contemporary manifestation of
Sully's Grand Design.
Previous attempts at monetary union lacked a political base. Three were
tried in the last century: between Austria and Germany from 1857 to 1866;
the Latin union of the 1860s and 1870s when French coins circulated freely
in Belgium, Switzerland, and Italy; and in Scandinavia from 1875 into this
century.
However the 'political improvement' which John Stuart Mill believed would
encourage a world currency was too fragile.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Letter: CAP reform not good news for EC rural development
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN BRYDEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Our research in 20 study areas in EC member states, supported by the EC
and the Economic and Social Research Council's joint agriculture and
environment programme, sheds light on the likely impact of CAP reform on
rural development in the EC.
First, we have found that the CAP has had little impact on providing farmers
or their families with incomes comparable to those elsewhere in the economy.
We estimate that half of all those farm family members and hired workers
involved in working their farms earn less than 41 per cent of their national
comparable incomes. The poorest farm families in Europe are, paradoxically,
less dependent on agricultural income than on social security and income
from working outside the farm.
It was the larger cereal farmers, mainly in northern Europe, who would have
suffered most from the proposed reforms under MacSharry 1, just as they had
benefited disproportionately under the previous arrangements. However,
political expediency has ensured that a good proportion of the agricultural
budget will be devoted to compensating these farmers for the price
reductions. Neither the new arrangements nor the compensation will improve
the situation for the many small and medium sized farms which are well below
comparable incomes already.
These farms are already partly dependent on outside earnings and social
security payments. Whether they remain in rural areas will depend less on
agriculture, and more on the development of rural labour markets which, in
turn, depends on rural development policy and the development of rural
businesses.
The Maastricht Treaty (Article 130a) introduces the development of rural
areas as a key issue for cohesion in the Community, as indeed it is. Yet, as
long as agricultural policy absorbs such a high proportion of the Community
budget, the development of new policies in this sphere will remain limited.
While there are many reasons to welcome the reform, it is not yet good news
for rural development. For the time being the massive inequities which the
CAP involves will remain and will act against the Community's efforts at
greater cohesion. This is not, by any stretch of the imagination, a 'level
playing field'.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Economic Viewpoint: An old alternative to conviction
politics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SAMUEL BRITTAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Do you believe in coming as close to equality in property and income as we
can? Or do you prefer an enterprise society, or a nation of inheritors?
Do you think that inflation is caused by too much money chasing too few
goods? Or by struggles between groups for incompatible shares of the
national product?
Should punishment fit the crime or the criminal?
This is a random assortment of disputed questions. What they have in common
is that they have been argued by men and women of goodwill for decades -
sometimes for centuries - and we are no nearer a consensus.
One prominent politician on the Conservative side, when faced with Big
Questions, is inclined to ask whether he has to decide or at least decide
now. I do know a book which attempts to provide such agnostics with a good
conscience; and I have been waiting to review it for well over 20 years. It
was jointly written by an American professor of politics, Charles Lindblom,
and a philosopher, David Braybrooke. It is called A Strategy of Decision,
and was first published in 1963. My own version is dated 1969. I have often
thought about it in the intervening years, but am only now beginning to make
up my mind about it.
The authors believe that the method of evaluation which is directly or
indirectly taught to undergraduates or even business leaders on courses is
misconceived. They call the orthodox approach 'synoptic' or
'rational-deductive'. It involves people setting out their ideals, equipping
themselves with a set of cause-and-effect relations, and then examining the
facts to decide.
Its defect, they believe, is that people will not merely disagree on values.
They often do not know what their values are until a specific problem
arises. People who can agree on inequity in a tax system - eg the poll tax -
will not necessarily agree what equity is.
The authors' preferred alternative is known as - wait for it - 'disjointed
incrementalism'. This may explain why their ideas are not on the lips of US
presidential candidates. They admit that the English 'piecemeal social
engineering' is a close approximation.
What they mean is that instead of choosing between great principles,
policymakers should go straight to specific decisions. Not, for instance: is
there a right to freedom of information? But will the disclosure of
membership of cabinet committees do more for free inquiry than harm to
efficient government?
The authors' essential point is that people who disagree on fundamentals can
still agree on specific steps. You do not have to agree on equality or
inequality to want to help those living in cardboard boxes.
I remember consciously thinking about Braybrooke and Lindblom during the
disputes between Margaret Thatcher and Nigel Lawson on exchange rate policy.
It often occurred to me - indeed I wrote - that it ought to be possible to
agree on whether to raise or lower interest rates, without agreeing on
whether a specific move was made to protect sterling or in reaction to some
measure of the domestic money supply - even, dare one say, agreeing to
disagree on the reasons. Such piecemeal accommodations are not facilitated,
however, by big, bold, but essentially vacuous statements such as: 'You
cannot buck the market.'
There is one thought which encapsulates the American authors' critique. It
is: do not insist on fundamental justification. You might agree with raising
interest rates in a boom or reducing them in a slump without deciding if you
are a monetarist or a Keynesian, let alone an exchange rate monetarist or a
parochial one.
Most political practitioners or committee chairman types would probably
regard A Strategy of Decision as a pretentious academic description of a
strategy they had been practising all their professional lives. Yet it is a
little more than this. What the US academics were saying is: 'Rest easy with
what you are doing. You are not cutting corners or sacrificing principles.
This is the only way even political theorists think you can decide.'
The book betrays its age, however, in its tacit assumption that the disputes
are mostly about values and that 'social scientists' have a good deal of
knowledge about how the world works. In recent years the disputes have been
about both, or about ideologies in which the two have been inextricably
mixed together.
The main objection to the 'strategy' is that it discourages more profound
reflection. The authors make much of the need to decide how much inflation
it is worth incurring to alleviate unemployment by so much here and now.
Later evidence and analysis suggested that there was no long-run trade-off
between the two. Anyone who had taken the 'strategy of decision' too much to
heart would have found himself (as governments did) with accelerating
inflation and no lasting improvement in jobs.
Indeed, 'disjointed incrementalism' actually tells practitioners to cut off
the chain of consequences at an early stage. The authors' buzzwords are
'limited', 'incremental', 'remedial' and 'successive approximation'. They
thus encourage unreflective interventionism and disjointed lists of points
characteristic of political manifesto writers.
It is therefore open to the charge of short-termism by disciples of Hayek,
who warned about the adverse long-run effect of a host of specific
interventions. But it is also vulnerable to social critics who worry about
the spillover effects of a market system, on our culture and on the
ecological balance, and who consider piecemeal corrections inadequate.
What should one conclude? During periods of 'conviction politics', one is
conscious of the fallibility of those exercising the convictions. During a
period of piecemeal social engineering, one begins to long for the 'vision
thing'.
The nearest I can come to a resolution is that policymakers should practise
disjointed incrementalism - as most of them are in any case inclined to do,
like Moliere's bourgeois gentilhomme who had been unwittingly talking prose
all his life - while there should be a vigorous debate among the clerisy on
fundamentals.
The distinctions need not be rigid. A former prime minister, Arthur Balfour,
had views on the Nature of Reality - which hardly committed the cabinet -
and chancellors (and even presidents) have had views on How the World
Economy Works. My suggestion is that they should erect Chinese walls between
their various activities.
Let Michael Heseltine give lectures on why manufacturing matters, and let
Peter Lilley explain why all goods and services have equal importance at the
margin in a competitive market. But when it comes to policy, both should go
as far as they can without having to decide on fundamentals. That way both
theorists and policymakers can feel a little easier; and one person in his
time can play several parts.

<TEXT>
Sir, The news that Mr Manfred Worner, the Nato secretary-general, has
advocated an out-of-area role for Nato ('Nato ready to step outside its
borders', May 22) must be met with some degree of alarm.
Having just returned from a visit to both Nato and Shape in Brussels, my
impression is that Nato has lost an enemy and has yet to find a role.
Off-the-record briefings from senior military personnel displayed internal
disagreements over whether Nato becoming a global policeman would require a
total renegotiation of the treaty itself or not.
My view is that the 1949 treaty enshrined the principle of an attack on one
is an attack on all, at a specific time with a specific enemy in mind. Now
that the enemy is no more, it is simply not good enough for Nato to start
changing the goal posts. If Nato member states want to engage in
peacekeeping exercises beyond their collective border, then our elected
representatives should renegotiate the treaty.

Should BT consider that any of those projected figures are in any way

FT  28 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Tightening up governance
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE REPORT of Sir Adrian Cadbury's committee on corporate governance has
more to offer than might have been expected from a group so obviously
composed of the great and the good. With the support of the London Stock
Exchange, the investment institutions and the accountancy profession, there
is every chance that a range of pragmatic and mainly constructive proposals
will contribute to higher standards of boardroom behaviour and financial
reporting across the country.
If there is a problem with the report's recommendations, it is simply that
expectations have been running high, in the wake of a succession of
corporate scandals. It seems questionable whether those expectations will be
fully satisfied by the incremental approach to reform that Sir Adrian and
his colleagues have adopted.
This is not wholly the fault of the committee itself, whose terms of
reference were narrow. When it was set up a year ago, the committee was
asked to address only the financial aspects of corporate governance, with a
view to restoring confidence in financial reporting and auditing practice.
Within that framework the important question is whether the committee has
been prepared to confront directly the conflicts of interest that go most of
the way towards explaining manifest weaknesses in the chain of
accountability from management to shareholders.
Selection process
Earlier attempts to address the problems that stem from the divorce between
ownership and control in quoted companies have placed emphasis on the role
of outside directors. Cadbury seeks to build on this by calling for a more
formal selection process for non-executive directors, who are free from
business or financial connections with the company. A key recommendation is
that the outside directors should be able to take independent professional
advice at the company's expense, which would significantly strengthen their
position.
This is sensible as far as it goes, but in the controversial area of
executive pay, the report falls conspicuously short. The suggestion that
companies should provide more detailed information and explain any
performance-related elements in the pay package is undeniably welcome; but
putting the names of a mainly non-executive remuneration committee in the
directors' report and requiring its chairman to answer to the annual general
meeting is no substitute for a shareholders' vote on directors'
remuneration.
Curious argument
This was rejected on the ground that it would be hard to persuade executives
to change jobs if their pay was subject to approval at an AGM - a curious
argument that assumes that shareholders including the big institutions will
not see the case for sensible remuneration packages.
Where the audit is concerned, the committee recognises that it is, in
practice, the management that retains the right to hire and fire the
auditor. It therefore seeks to buttress the auditor's independence by
establishing audit committees for all companies, the rotation of audit
partners within firms and direct access for the auditor to non-executives on
the board.
One of the shortcomings of the report is its failure fully to recognise that
the non-executive directors are part of the problem rather than the
solution. As long as the outside director's responsibilities are legally the
same as those of the executive directors it is hard to believe that the
relationship between the two animals will be other than cosy. Outside
directors will continue to identify with the leadership of the company at
the expense of the control function that they are expected to exercise.
Similarly, auditors will always have too cosy a relationship with management
if shareholders have no real say in the appointment and audit business
becomes a loss-leader for other financial services. Yet Cadbury sees no way
in which shareholders could be brought into the procedures for appointing
and remunerating the auditor. Nor does the committee accept the case for a
ban on consultancy.
By providing a clearer definition of responsibilities, the committee may
well succeed in mitigating some of the damage arising from these fundamental
conflicts. But it will not, inevitably, be the last word.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Personal View: Stronger than nations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER SUTHERLAND
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The anti-federalist case put by Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former UK prime
minister, and the Bruges Group has the merit of being simple. But in this
instance, the consequence of simplifying a complex issue is the distortion
of reality.
The anti-federalists oppose a system of European Community governance that
involves the reduction of national sovereignty. What they have failed to
address is the fact that the principle they seek to uphold has already been
conceded by binding treaty.
EC membership entails the unambiguous rejection of unfettered national
sovereignty and this was absolutely clear at the date of accession by the UK
in 1973. The principle of the supremacy of Community law was established
clearly in the 1960s, as was the doctrine of direct application which gives
individuals the right to sue their government for breach of Community law.
These developments form part of the foundations of a political structure to
which the neologism 'supranational' has been applied.
Whatever else may be argued, therefore, one may not suggest that the EC is
an intergovernmental structure, nor that the road on which it now finds
itself was unidentified from the earliest days. Indeed the Single European
Act, endorsed by Mrs Thatcher, not merely expressed the will of all the
member states 'to transform relations as a whole among their states into a
European union' but also significantly reduced traditional national
sovereignty by introducing majority voting into areas previously requiring
unanimity.
It is no longer a legitimate part of the debate, therefore, to develop a
polemic on the basis of retaining total sovereignty. That debate is one
about rejecting membership.
Those who oppose European integration accuse the Commission of 'exploiting'
the Single European Act. It is difficult to know what this can mean as the
Commission may only propose legislation and not adopt it. If the principle
of majority voting causes concern, let it be recalled that there was no
mystery about the issue when it was decided; it was clearly recognised that
the '1992 project' could not succeed if one member state could effectively
block progress.
In other areas, too, the role of the Commission is vital to the creation of
the internal market - an objective so strongly advocated by the UK
government. The reality is that it would not be possible to envisage the
market functioning without effective governance from Brussels.
If member states were permitted freely to grant subsidies to industry, this
would inevitably distort competition. The fact that the Commission, under an
authority vested in it by Article 92 of the Treaty of Rome, may prohibit
such aids is a clear infringement of national sovereignty. But is it a power
that the anti-federalists would now deny? Similarly, would they deny the
power to propose regulations or directives creating competition in air
transport or telecommunications?
It is unreasonable to argue against regulation from Brussels, particularly
when the effect of the regulation is to dismantle protectionism. Like it or
not the essential logic of the EC is based upon a supranational vocation.
On the political level it is argued by some that the new circumstances of
Europe demand a loosening of the ties that bind the continent together. They
see enlargement, perhaps, as a way of making the Community unworkable as it
currently operates. It would be ironic if the European Free Trade
Association countries now so anxious to join a Community with supranational
powers were to be the unwitting cause of its disintegration into a loose
intergovernmental body such as that which they had left.
That, however, seems to be the aim of some in the UK and elsewhere. These
critics point to the break-up of alleged federal structures in central and
eastern Europe as evidence of the failure of federalism, while ignoring the
fact that these failed entities were undemocratic fusions. On the other hand
the concept of European union is crucially dependent on democratic sanction.
Successive polls of public opinion testify to the broad measure of support
throughout the Community.
It was extreme nationalism and the experience of the Second World War that
provided the stimulus for European integration and the creation of a
supranational state. Today we are challenged again by nationalism. A
reversion to the traditional nation state is not the way to contest this
challenge.
The fact that western Europe has enjoyed peace since 1945 while other areas
have been traumatised by war is not unrelated to the new way in which we
govern our affairs. To return to the earlier world of co-operation between
sovereign states rather than integration would be to risk reliving the worst
moments of our turbulent history.

commissioner.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Arts: Hvorostovsky and Borodina - Music in London
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Between performances of I Puritani at Covent Garden, the young Siberian
baritone Dmitri Hvorostovsky found time for a Barbican concert on Tuesday.
It was an excellent idea to present along with him the St Petersburg mezzo
Olga Borodina (a year younger), but odd to give her conspicuously
second-fiddle billing; in fact they took equal shares in the music.
They sang Italian opera - Bellini, Ponchielli, Donizetti and Rossini - with
the City of London Sinfonia, conducted by Julian Reynolds. The orchestra
also delivered four matching overtures, quite expertly but without the fizz
and brio for Rossini. (Reynolds was disarmingly genealogised in the
programme-book as 'of Russian, German and English decent': just so.) As
accompanists, they were entirely satisfactory, and the programme happily
favoured their fine first cello.
Reports of I Puritani have said that Hvorostovsky sounded underpowered.
Perhaps at the Barbican he wanted to strike back: he opened up impressive
reserves of power, and (like Miss Borodina) chose to sustain climactic notes
with maximum force - once, even, after the orchestra had ended the music. At
that level of attack, his timbre still boasted plenty of depth and density,
not always 'beautiful' in the narrow sense. His boyish pout-and-grin, and
his open-armed manner, made a piquant contrast with a voice that is surely
aimed toward the bass-baritone range.
The King Alfonso of Donizetti's Favorita suited him best, from stentorian
protest to a melting duet with Borodina's 'Favorita'. In their Barbiere
excerpts he made a brusque, slightly dangerous Figaro (imagine 'Largo al
factotum' sung as if it were Basilio's 'Rumour'-aria). With his dark,
covered vowels, mercurial Italian delivery is not his forte, though forte it
certainly was. There, Miss Borodina shaded him.
In La Cieca's aria from La Gioconda, and as Leonora in the Favorita
excerpts, her unstinting warmth and easy dignity explained at once the
sensation she created at Edinburgh as Mussorgsky's Marfa. In the Favorita
duet, she and Hvorostovsky sang like loving twins. With Rossini, however, a
new facet was displayed to brilliant effect: in coloratura, Borodina bids to
be a worthy heir of Marilyn Horne.
I would bet that she knows Horne's account of the Semiramide 'Ah] quel
giorno' very well indeed, but she gave her own stamp to that spectacular
aria. Resilient poise and pounce, if not quite Horne's electrical snap and
crackle; and in certain phrases, a bonus of lusty tendresse over Horne's
patrician sweep. For the Barbiere Rosina she revealed a further range of
comic and romantic airs and graces, crowned by a playfully dramatic 'Una
voce poco fa' of real distinction.
There is clearly a lot more of the Borodina potential to be explored, with
high expectations. We hear her soon at the Royal Opera, with Domingo in
Samson et Dalila.

THE MAMBO KINGS (15) MGMs West End
MEDICINE MAN (PG) Odeon West End
THE ADJUSTER (18) Metro RUBY (15) Odeon West End
The Mambo dance craze swept the West in the early 1950s. Aged about three at
the time, I was able to resist its infectious Latin American rhythms. Not so
many others, including my nanny. She would steal my rattle and use it as a
castanet, ruthlessly performing numbers like 'Guantanamera' and 'Mambo
Caliente' over my defenceless pram.
Scarred by this experience, I expected to dislike The Mambo Kings, directed
by Arne Glincher from a screenplay by Cynthia Cidre based on Oscar
Hijuelos's Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. Instead the movie proves
appallingly enjoyable. Everything is as overheated as in a Mambo song.
Armand Assante as Cesar, a snake in human clothing, and Antonio Banderas as
his younger brother Nestor, an innocent plucked from happy love in Havana,
are the singing Cuban brothers who try to make it big in crime-ridden 1950s
New York.
Assante manages to make it big almost everywhere, especially in bed. Here he
enjoys the lovely, capacious body of nightclub cigarette seller Cathy
Moriarty, a sort of human stretch-limousine.
Banderas falls for pretty Maruschka Detmers. And these four hurl themselves
at a plot full of dance, song, jealousy, sex, murder and all the other
things we might normally complain we get enough of at home.
The pace is so bright and pushy that it cannot be resisted. The villains
snarl on cue - chiefly Roscoe Lee Browne as a black mobster trying to mop up
the 'Mambo Kings' for his own nightclub empire - and the dialogue is out of
Raymond Chandler by Mae West. 'He thinks he's the last Coca-Cola in the
desert,' cracks a girl in the dance-club crowd as she watches the delirious
Assante dance with Miss Detmers. 'He is, honey,' drily retorts Miss
Moriarty.
Then there is Desi Arnaz Jr as Desi Arnaz Sr, signing our heroes for an I
Love Lucy show on TV. (Assante and Banderas are cleverly cut into
black-and-white dialogue scenes featuring the late Miss Ball). There are
fancy opticals from director Glincher, as the recurring image of a couple
dancing across the screen 'wipes' old scenes and paints in new ones. And of
course there is the music: Tito Puente, Duke Ellington, Beny More - my nanny
would be in heaven.
* * * In Medicine Man Sean Connery is a scientist working in the Amazon.
Though described by his new workmate Lorraine Bracco as 'Dr Mengele with a
pony tail', he is more like Tarzan with a test tube. He swings between
100-foot trees while collecting rare bromeliads which he has successfully
used on the local Indians as, yes, a cure for cancer.
Unfortunately he has now forgotten the formula. When young Miss Bracco
arrives loud and yacky and businesslike ('I'm surprised they sent a woman,'
says someone, unschooled in the ways of Hollywood), he plays Bogart to her
Hepburn.
Shambling about his hangar-size shack, he raves in dishevelled fashion
against women, civilisation and bureaucracy. He can afford to. He lives in
Paradise, photographed by Donald McAlpine as if he and his camera crew had
been force-fed with Rousseau paintings.
He is surrounded by naked tribeswomen, ogled by director John McTiernan (The
Hunt For Red October). And he practises golf swings in a jungle clearing.
This is burying oneself in the wild for the benefit of humanity?
Tom Dead Poets Society Schulman took a cool Dollars 1m for his original
screenplay, which on reaching screen seems one of the silliest in memory.
When not trying to put the eek back into ecology - snakes in the rafters,
heroines dangling over 300-foot chasms - the film attempts to be a screwball
romance between an ageing Superdoc and a young tomboy.
But you cannot create comedy or sexual chemistry in a vacuum. This jungle is
nowhere, this plot is a non-starter; and the only time I inwardly cheered
was when Miss Bracco, tasting a rare jungle bean, declared that it would
'knock Maxwell House right off the shelf.' Could this be the first example
of product displacement in the cinema?
* * * The Adjuster is one of those films in which the quality of strain has
no mercy. Canadian writer-director Atom Egoyan is fascinated by the
depersonalising drift of the modern world.
We know that already from his earlier, better films: from the family torn
apart by couch-potato callousness in Family Viewing or from the ugly mergers
of big business and private porn in Speaking Parts.
His new film repeats the old themes in a plot so poorly glued together you
want to hand it back for re-assembly. Insurance claims 'adjuster' Elias
Koteas preys upon females who have lost their homes in fires, seducing them
at the Mishap Motel where his company puts them up.
Meanwhile, the new house he himself has bought in an otherwise uninhabited
new estate is about to be invaded by a porno-minded film-maker who likes its
privacy.
Oh and Mr Koteas, an amateur archer, sometimes shoots arrows at developers'
signs. Toxophily, as Theodore Roosevelt almost once said, and carry a big
stick. Egoyan's big stick is aimed at the evil ways in which primal emotions
and Platonic ideals in today's world have become shadows of shadows: love
turning to sex, care to welfare, order to bureaucracy.
Fine themes but fatuous treatment. Egoyan has succumbed to the reductive
evils he aspires to expose. He prefers the flashy well-labelled image - the
arrows of righteousness, the opening scene of a sick old tramp rescued from
subway death by a rich lady - to any exploration of who these people are and
what, apart from the film-maker's clockwork symbolism, makes them tick.
* * * 'I dunnit so one day everything's gonna have to be brung out in the
open,' says Danny Aiello in Ruby. Little could the real Jack Ruby have
known, when he shot Lee Harvey Oswald in a Dallas police station in 1963
with the world's watching TV cameras still in shock after JFK's death, that
30 years on, every imaginable who-did-what scenario would have been 'brung
out' by the movies.
Ruby is to JFK what an elephant with a twisted ankle is to a gazelle on
steroids. Scripted by Stephen Davis from his stage play Love Field, the film
plods from one shoestring set to the next - Ruby's sleazy Dallas nightclub,
a 'luxury' Las Vegas hotel that looks like a down-market Days Inn - as
Aiello's too too stolid Ruby sorts through, or is sorted through by, the
usual shopping basket of conspiracy candidates: Mafia, FBI, CIA, CBI, BFI,
YMCA. . .
The tedium is briefly relieved by the headline scenes: the tingle of history
has not left Dealey Plaza or that Dallas police basement. But nothing
redeems a film which tries to gain a box-office fillip by such putrid
gimmicks as inventing a Monroe-like heroine - Sherilyn Fenn as a stripper
made privy to State secrets. John Mackenzie of The Long Good Friday directs.
Finally, two neglected Maurices. My reviews of Maurice Pialat's Van Gogh
(12, Lumiere) and Maurizio Nichetti's Volere, Volare (15, Metro) fell off
the bottom of my column recently, due to the space demands of Miss
Dietrich's death. Both films are still playing and one is worth seeing.
Nichetti's comedy about a cartoon film sound-dubber, taken over by the
creatures whose moos and honks he imitates, has enough ingenuity to make up
for a wandering plotline. Like Who framed Roger Rabbit, it deftly mixes
animation with live action.
Little animation, alas, in Pialat's account of Vincent VG (Jacques Dutronc)
as a low-energy epateur of the bourgeoisie living in picture-pretty
Provence. Bring back Kirk Douglas in Lust For Life.

Judging from Max Loppert's recent review on this page we should all be sure
to switch on Radio 3 at 7.05 for the live relay from Cardiff of the Welsh
National Opera's new production of Iphigenie en Tauride. The story, taken
from Euripides by Francois Guillard, is that of Iphigenie, daughter of
Agamemnon, and her brother Orestes, in the aftermath of the Trojan war. The
opera was written by Gluck when he was 65 and Kobbe tells the story of a
contemporary who remarked that there were many fine passages in it. 'There
is only one' said the Abbe Arnaud. 'Which?'  - 'The entire work'. In this
production Iphigenie is sung by Diana Montague and Orestes by Simon
Keenlyside.
Two television programmes look at wholesale and retail trade. Business
Matters returns to BBC2 with a documentary about Levi Strauss, the original
manufacturer of denim jeans and now the world's largest clothing company,
which faces a serious problem from counterfeiters (7.25). Channel 4's series
The Black Bag (8.00) looks into allegations that wholesalers of newspapers
and magazines are refusing to supply Asian shopkeepers.

<TEXT>
The London Philharmonic Orchestra and the male half of the LP Choir
delivered a high-octane performance of Stravinsky's 'opera-oratorio' on
Tuesday: sung by a group of first-rate solo singers, riproaringly delivered
by orchestra and chorus, and highly worrying.
The conductor was Franz Welser-Most, the LPO's music director, who here
evidenced only the faintest familiarity with the tenets of Stravinsky style.
A sudden unlicensed spurt on the accelerator pedal halfway throught the
granitic opening chorus was a warning sign that proved all too timely. For,
throughout the work, Mr Welser-Most sought speed and noise, surface show and
drama at the expense of plain musical intelligibility.
It is quite a feat to drown out a bass as naturally powerful as John
Tomlinson, the Creon, but conductor and orchestra managed it - as indeed
they did the quadruple 'Divum Jocastae' cries of Peter Coleman-Wright's
potentially impressive Messenger.
Stravinsky's score works its lapidary magnificence through the exact place
and change of gesture and scene, through the cutting edge of 'antique'
harmonic and textural invention.
In this slam-bang reading, which paid scant attention to the timing of
sentences and paragraphs, to letting air into the sound, the magnificence
largely went missing.
Anthony Rolfe Johnson's agile, liquidly lyrical, emotionally forceful
Oedipus, Marjana Lipovsek's bronze-toned Jocasta, the authoritative Shepherd
of John Mark Ainsley and Tiresias of Alastair Miles, and the elegantly
matter-of-fact narrator Lambert Wilson deserved better.
Earlier, the programme had offered Young Uck Kim's scrupulously musical but
small-scale account of the Prokofiev First Violin Concerto, and a simply
frightful La Valse as concert-opener - un-Ravellian in coarseness of loud
sound, utterly lacking in wit and irony, a linked series of firecracker
climaxes rather than (as the composer imagined) a 'fantastic and fatal
whirling'.
Mr Welser-Most is young and hugely talented, but at the head of one of
London's big orchestras, the handicaps of his inexperience become ever more
widely exposed.
Royal Festival Hall.
(Concert under the auspices of
the Royal Philharmonic
Society, sponsored by Commercial Union).

FT  28 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Wash &amp; get into a
lather in Poland - A hair-raising tale about selling shampoo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GUY DE JONQUIERES AND CHRISTOPHER BOBINSKI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Procter &amp; Gamble, the large US consumer products manufacturer, is widely
credited with inventing the principles of modern marketing. But the
company's hard-sell techniques have met their come-uppance in Poland, where
its plans to take the shampoo market by storm have whipped up a lather.
The cause of all the fuss is P&amp;G's Vidal Sassoon Wash &amp; Go, an all-in-one
shampoo and conditioner which is a best-seller in the west. Launched in
Poland last August, the product was supported by a marketing blitz on a
scale never before seen in the country.
At first, the campaign worked brilliantly. Though Poland's most expensive
shampoo, Wash &amp; Go quickly became the most popular, capturing more than a
third of the market. But earlier this year, sales suddenly plummeted.
Then, the rumours began. From street markets to dinner parties, a whispering
campaign spread that Wash &amp; Go caused dandruff and hair loss  - allegations
which P&amp;G has strenuously denied.
'There have been lots of rumours,' says Barbara Fig, owner of the Palo Palo
cosmetics shop in Warsaw, who says she sells little Wash &amp; Go these days.
'Maybe they started because a lot of acid rain fell last year.'
The shampoo has also inspired countless local jokes. 'I washed my car with
it, and the tyres went bald,' runs one. And when President Lech Walesa
proposed earlier this year that he also become prime minister, critics
derided the idea as 'a two-in-one solution, just like Wash &amp; Go'.
P&amp;G went into overdrive to limit the damage. It hastily commissioned a
survey by CBOS, the Polish government's opinion research agency, of public
attitudes towards its products and sent the results to shopkeepers and
wholesalers late last month.
A covering letter from Robert Fregolle Jr, P&amp;G's commercial director in
Poland, urged them to continue stocking Wash &amp; Go, stating that it had
undergone 150,000 hours of clinical tests and was used by 250m consumers
worldwide.
Fregolle acknowledged 'negative rumours' about the product and offered money
back and a free medical examination to customers who complained that their
hair had been damaged. For good measure, he added that P&amp;G's president, John
Pepper, had recently visited Lech Walesa to discuss starting production in
Poland.
The company also ran newspaper advertisements proclaiming that Wash &amp; Go had
been approved by Polish health authorities and launched a corporate campaign
featuring it alongside other successful P&amp;G products such as Ariel
detergent, Tampax sanitary tampons and Pampers nappies.
P&amp;G admits that sales of Wash &amp; Go, which it imports from plants in western
Europe, fell in the first quarter of this year but says they have now
started to recover and expects them to regain last December's peak levels
next month. However, several retailers in Warsaw say the shampoo is still
moving off their shelves only slowly.
Where did P&amp;G go wrong? The most common theory is that it promoted Wash &amp; Go
too hard in a country which, for all its enthusiasm for western products, is
still unused to brash Madison Avenue-style advertising.
A recent poll by Pentor, a private market research company in Warsaw, found
that almost three times more Poles disliked P&amp;G's commercials than liked
them - one of the poorest ratings for any western company. Polish Wash &amp; Go
commercials, based on an international campaign by the Leo Burnett agency of
Chicago, have recently been revamped.
P&amp;G is by far the biggest television advertiser in Poland and is committed
to spending Dollars 10m there on advertising, marketing, distribution and
training over three years. To promote Wash &amp; Go, the company also
mass-mailed free samples to households and organised a whistle-stop tour of
Poland by Vidal Sassoon, the British-born hairdresser.
But many experts argue that the marketing barrage backfired because years of
Communist Party propaganda have led Polish consumers to suspect that
advertising is simply a way to shift products nobody wants to buy.
Some also believe that Wash &amp; Go, developed for US consumers who shampoo
daily, was too advanced for Polish consumers less obsessed with personal
hygiene. P&amp;G has promised an 'education' campaign for customers.
Though executives of many other western companies operating in Poland are
privately amused by the incident, few are gloating. Says one: 'P&amp;G's problem
was that it was the first into the market. All of us will make mistakes -
that's the price of doing business here.'

FT  28 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): The end of the image
 -Robert Thomson says that Japanese companies have abandoned fancy gimmickry
for old-fashioned selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSOM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the heady days of the late 1980s, when the Tokyo stock market seemed able
to defy gravity and GNP was growing at 7 per cent, prospering Japanese
companies indulged their advertising fantasies.
They hired the likes of Mickey Rourke and Mike Tyson, and embarked on lavish
publicity campaigns of 'image-up', as profile raising is called in Japan.
Manufacturers queued to sponsor their favourite television programmes and
became prominent patrons of the arts.
That easy money has dried up. Having grown accustomed to double-digit growth
in advertising expenditure, which was up 15 per cent in 1989, television
networks are having to adjust to meagre increases, while newspapers,
magazines and advertising agencies are coming to terms with the first
revenue falls since 1965.
Dentsu, Japan's largest agency, reckons that newspaper advertising was down
1 per cent in the first quarter, billing for magazines by 2 per cent, and
for radio by 7 per cent. Television programme sponsorship was 1 per cent
lower while commercials rose 2 per cent.
'The industries hardest hit by the bursting of the financial bubble, like
securities and real estate, have cut their advertising the most. Electronics
are also down, but other industries, like cosmetics, are still showing
growth,' Dentsu said.
Advertising by the securities industry, stricken by scandal and losses, fell
almost by half last year. Property-related advertising was 12 per cent lower
in the first quarter this year.
Hardly surprisingly, the changes in advertising match broader changes in
spending patterns: Japanese consumers have put off buying that new
television or video, and instead are spending increasing amounts on food -
reflected in a near 10 per cent rise in food advertising.
Companies are responding to the new frugal mood by shifting away from
advertising designed to improve their image and towards product-specific
messages.
Japanese advertisments are famed for their abstruse imagery, with companies
taking up costly television time to convey scenes of tree trunks, sunflower
stalks and moss-covered rocks that were distant from their products. But
falling income and concerns about the success of new products in weak
domestic markets have concentrated their campaigns.
The trend is evident in the steep fall in property-related television
advertising in the first quarter, as the industry uses newspapers and
magazines to market individual properties. Land developers had previously
been fond of projecting themselves as environment-friendly, renaissance
companies, but now they are more interested in selling houses.
Sekisui House, the country's largest builder of houses, said economic
downturn has prompted the company to 'review the use of advertising' in an
attempt to maximise sales of unsold appartments. 'The most important thing
for us now is our products,' Sekisui said.
Similar sentiments were expressed by Katsuhiko Muramoto, vice-president of
Daikyo, the leading Tokyo apartment builder: 'Advertising is a tool for
developing our business, but we have to use it in an efficient manner. We
are reducing all kinds of waste.'
Nissan Motor, the car maker, said that it, too, is most concerned about
enticing customers to buy a car rather than enhancing its corporate image:
'This year our budget is down by 10 per cent, but we can't afford to cut
television advertising - it's too important. In total, television and
newspapers make up about 85 per cent of our advertising expenses.'
Companies have become more conservative in their choice of advertising
content. Some are unwilling to change long-running themes that have been
successful, but now appear tired. Others are re-using themes that brought
them success five or six years ago, and even employing the same actors and
actresses.
In attempting to cut costs for clients, agencies are searching for themes in
which to bundle diverse companies. The Hakuhodo agency suggested a joint
campaign for Shiseido, the cosmetic company, and the Mainichi newspaper
group, both of which are commemorating their 120th anniversaries this year.
The agency also expects an increase in cost-saving product partnerships
between companies with shared interests - for example, between Honda Motor
and Misawa Homes for television commercials showing a house with a two-car
garage, and Japan Airlines and Sony, the electronics company, for a package
tour that would not be complete without a video camera.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Management (Marketing and Advertising): Sport goes up in
smoke
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ELISABETH TACEY and GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
While Europe dithers over tobacco advertising, Australia has taken the
drastic step of banning sport sponsorship by tobacco companies.
In a sport-mad country the ban - which comes into effect in 1995 - is a
serious matter. The state of Tasmania has said it may defy it, arguing that
it is unfair to deprive sports bodies of so much cash.
Indeed, tobacco groups - which since 1976 have been prevented from
conventional advertising - contribute an estimated ADollars 20m (Pounds
8.5m) a year towards the total ADollars 120m sport sponsorship market.
The Confederation of Australian Sport is hoping to persuade the federal
government to set up a health fund paid from a levy on tobacco sales. Some
states already have such a scheme: Victoria has paid about ADollars 25m over
three years in 'Quit' sponsorship.
Sports associations are finding other ways of fighting back: lobby group the
NSW Sports Federation has called for blacklisting of companies that use
sport in their advertising without contributing to it.
Alcohol companies fear they may be next in line, but Ros Kelly, the sports
minister, says she has no plans for further bans. She argues that there is
no safe level of nicotine intake, whereas moderate drinking may even be good
for you.
Tobacco sponsorship is already restricted in many EC countries: it is banned
in Portugal and Italy, while in France tobacco advertising and sponsorship
are due to be phased out by 1993. This is expected to cost the motor racing
alone some FFr350m (Pounds 35m) a year.
Tobacco companies in the UK spend Pounds 7m a year on sponsorship,
particularly of sport. Since the UK banned tobacco advertising on
television, sponsorship has become more important.
However, the practice is increasingly controversial: the BBC was recently
criticised by the Health Education Authority for allowing back-door tobacco
advertising worth the equivalent of some Pounds 200m annually. It claimed
that by strategically placing tobacco logos in sponsored sporting events,
the industry got television coverage without paid-for advertising.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Business Law: Database copyright raises dilemma
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CELIA HAMPTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The legal tensions resulting from the European single market are highlighted
in the current proposal to introduce a uniform protection for databases.
National laws are particularly discordant on this issue, with copyright
denied by some and given generously by others. Predictably, the industry has
developed most strongly where the protection is greatest - the UK.
Comparable, preferably identical, legal treatment in all the countries of
the single market is desirable, especially in view of the ease of access
provided by telecommunications in this market. Distortions will inevitably
emerge if users have to pay fees for access to a database in one country,
while in another they can copy it with impunity.
Yet any uniform legal treatment must be acceptable in all member countries.
If some are to gain, any loss to the others must be perceived as necessary
and manageable. The solution proposed by the EC Commission might improve the
protection of databases in some places, but it would seriously limit the
protection already available in the UK (and also in Ireland).
The draft directive would provide two distinct sorts of protection. First, a
specific 10-year protection would give the database owner an exclusive right
not to have data unfairly extracted from the database. The public interest
in having access to the information would be balanced by, for example,
compulsory licensing of the extraction and reuse for commercial purposes of
the material on the database if this was not available elsewhere.
Second, the draft would extend regular copyright to databases on the analogy
of collected works (such as anthologies), provided that the selection and
arrangement of the collection were the original 'intellectual creation' of
its author. This was inspired by the protection of collected works under
article 2(5) of the Berne Copyright Convention, which all EC countries have
ratified.
That formula was agreed long before the invention of computers and, although
it might allow an unobjectionable extension of non-UK concepts of copyright,
is not appropriate for this purpose. The requirement of original selection
or arrangement is problematic where the selection is exhaustive or where the
arrangement is commonplace: arrangement of material in alphabetical order
would not be regarded as an intellectually creative process anywhere except
the British Isles.
Even if the database were created by original selection and arrangement, the
proposed copyright would not cover the materials contained in the database.
However, the 'reproduction' of the database, in full or in part, would be
restricted by copyright. This is rather difficult to understand; it suggests
that use of material from the database would be restricted only if it
replicated the selection and arrangement. In cases other than outright
piracy, it would surely be the material contained in the database that
people would want to copy.
A database is simply a collection of information which, for present
purposes, is electronically managed. It may be about anything at all - from
telephone numbers to share prices, from racehorses to law - and may well be
a collection of facts. The assembly of information almost always has a
commercial value; the work of assembling it invariably involves a labour
cost.
A database normally includes all the information on a given subject. This
feature often gives the database its peculiar value: selectivity of the
contents would make it less valuable in the hands of the users, whose needs
may be diverse. The database owner indexes the information so that the user
can readily gain access to certain items. The user, rather than the owner,
makes the selection.
This comprehensive quality distinguishes UK law which, almost alone in the
world, is willing to protect a mere assembly of facts with the full majesty
of copyright. Most other copyright laws only protect the product of personal
creativity, while unfair competition law protects the product of hard work
from being purloined by other people.
The difference between UK and continental copyright is embedded even in the
terminology: copyright means the right in a text, while continental laws
refer to the 'right of the author' (droit d'auteur, Urheberrecht). US law
limits copyright in collections of facts to those which have some element of
originality in their selection, co-ordination or arrangement.
Although UK law does not protect a fact itself with copyright, it protects
the expression of several facts in one place. For example, BT does not have
copyright in my telephone number, so I am free to publish it and, moreover,
to publish other telephone numbers I know personally. But I need BT's
permission to publish names and numbers lifted in bulk from its own
directory.
The draft directive would lay down not only the minimum protection EC
countries would have to give databases, but also the maximum. If EC law said
that there would be no copyright in compilations of facts, UK law could not
give any. The resulting loss of protection under UK copyright law would deal
a body blow to the information industry.
Hamish Sandison of Linklaters &amp; Paines, who has made a study of database
protection in the EC, US and UK, takes the view that any meaningful
protection for computerised databases under copyright law must cover the
product of hard work, as well as of more intellectually creative activities.
Although it raises a number of questions, the proposed 10-year protection is
fundamentally less controversial than the copyright proposals. But simply
leaving copyright to national law, apart from failing to help the single
market, would have drawbacks.
One is the rather awkward case law of the European Court of First Instance
in the Magill litigation, now on appeal to the European Court of Justice: an
exclusive right must not be exercised in such a way that it impedes
development of competition in the market.
Leaving copyright law alone would probably lead many commercial databases to
set up in the UK or Ireland. They could then make their contracts with users
subject to English or Irish law, including copyright law. Even if the
advantage to the UK and Ireland were swallowed by other EC countries, this
solution might not work: enforcing the contract against a user in another
country might be challenged on the basis that it offended local notions of
public policy (ordre public), and problems might arise where the database
passed out of the contracted user's hands, for example on a compact disc.
UK copyright is admittedly something of a sledgehammer: the owner has
exclusive rights over the compilation for at least 50 years. The courts
extended copyright in lists of facts to fill the gap left by the absence of
unfair competition law. Droit d'auteur lawyers would object to this, because
the compiler could exclude others from access to facts which should be in
the public domain. UK lawyers, however, already have to live with the EC
concept of abuse in the exercise of an exclusive right.
A possible solution would be to extend UK copyright throughout the EC for
electronic databases. The 10-year protection would then be redundant, and
the licensing provisions would have to be attached to the new copyright. But
this would discriminate between computer-based and other compilations, and a
conflict would arise where the database was not wholly electronic
('arranged, stored and accessed by electronic means', in the words of the
draft).
UK business might be willing to accept a curtailment of copyright if UK law
 -including any EC directive - embodied a good general protection against
unfair competition.
The Commission's present draft misses the point. An extension of the droit
d'auteur to cover compilations concentrating on selection would normally be
useless because any selection process contradicts the purpose of most
databases. Worse, it would destroy the existing protection provided by UK
law. Unless a better Europe-wide system can be devised, the UK model gives
the young European database industry a benign helping hand in international
competition.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Reorganisation within Granada's leisure division brings in Roger Mavity from
the advertising world to run one of the two new divisions, Granada Leisure
Development, comprising hotels, theme parks/tour operations, and UK and
Irish travel businesses.
Mavity, 47, had built up his own advertising agency Mavity Gilmore, the bulk
of which he sold to FCA Group in 1988. He stayed on, however, until the end
of last year as chairman of FCA Mavity, running the UK business, and also
sitting on the international board. But his years in the business had
increasingly convinced him that 'advertising is not the solution to every
problem', and he also felt ready, after running his own show, to work within
a larger group.
Charles Allen, recently appointed chief executive of the leisure operation,
is a fellow Irishman and colleague, from their days at Compass, of Gerry
Robinson, the Granada boss. He had got to know Mavity when the latter had
done some assignments for him at Compass, and had been struck by his
combination of 'management ability, sales and marketing know-how and
entrepreneurial skills. They don't normally come together in one person,'
remarks Allen.
At the same time, John Williams, chief executive of Granada Studio Tours,
becomes managing director of Granada theme parks and hotels. Starting out as
a management trainee at the Horserace Betting Levy Board, he managed Sandown
Park before joining Granada Television in 1978.

FT  28 MAY 92 / People: Regional attraction for Dighe
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Singer &amp; Friedlander, the merchant bank, has appointed Ian Dighe a director
with responsibility for expanding corporate finance operations in the
Midlands from a base in Birmingham.
For Dighe, the appointment is one of a series which has taken him through
the worlds of banking, accountancy, industry and individual consultancy,
always working in financial and managerial capacities.
Immediately before joining Singer &amp; Friedlander, he was an executive
director at McLeod Russel, the surface coatings and property company, where
he was in charge of acquisitions and disposals.
His appointment is unusual in two senses. First, merchant banks have been
retrenching in the regions rather than expanding. 'There is no point in
having regional offices unless you have them fully staffed in all
disciplines,' Dighe says, with an eye on providing corporate advice
especially to companies with a market capitalisation of less than Pounds
150m.
Second, according to Dighe, 'there are very few jobs where you get a high
degree of autonomy and a task to get on with.'
Dighe, 37, and married with three children, is also attracted to the
Midlands for an extra-curricular reason. He is a country pursuits and
shooting man which is, he says, 'why I'm not anywhere near London.'

FT  28 MAY 92 / Accountancy Column: Easing the burden of small company
audits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STELLA FEARNLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROSPECT of tougher auditing standards and the costs of the new
compliance mechanisms are making a nonsense of existing audit requirements
for small companies.
This month's proposed new standards from the Auditing Practices Board (APB)
put greater burdens on auditors by recommending that they are more
pro-active in ensuring that a company is a 'going concern', and that they
issue more definitive opinions on the financial statements in audit reports.
Meanwhile, auditors are having to adjust to a costly new regulatory regime,
introduced in October 1991. All auditors must now be registered as competent
to carry out company audits. They are subject to inspection to ensure they
are complying with new regulations, which lay down standards for practice
management, independence, professional conduct, technical competence,
training and the conduct of audits.
To date, there are over 15,600 auditors names on the register, responsible
for scrutinising the accounts of more than 1m companies. Many are small
firms and sole practitioners whose client portfolio contains only small
companies. They have been forced into this complex and costly regime because
unlike other EC countries, UK company law does not differentiate in its
audit requirements between the multinational conglomerate and the
owner-managed corner shop. Consequently neither do the current auditing
standards and guidelines.
The more effective the APB's future pronouncements are in tightening up on
recognised inadequacies in the audit process, the greater the regulatory
burden they will impose on the small business sector and the less
appropriate the regime will become for the sector.
Many practitioners and proprietors of small companies hold the view that the
law is an ass on the subject, and the closer one gets to the practicalities
of auditing small companies the more asinine it becomes. There are questions
over whom the audit benefits, conflicts over the auditor's role, and
practical difficulties in conducting audits.
Consider the situation of a small trading company controlled and run by a
husband and wife as directors. In compliance with the requirements of
company law, they maintain the legal minimum accounting records: a cash
book, personal ledgers for debtors and creditors, and a record of the
year-end stock, along with supporting vouchers.
The directors do not normally have the knowledge or expertise to prepare
their own legal accounts, calculate their tax liabilities or carry out the
duties of the Company Secretary. So they hire a practising accountant who
performs these tasks as their agent and often acts as a business adviser.
The relationship becomes muddied when the accountant has to shift position
from acting as agent for the directors to acting as auditor of the company.
The law requires him to report to the shareholders on the truth and fairness
of accounts which he has just prepared for them in their capacity as
directors. In other words, the auditor expresses an opinion on his own work
to enable the directors to report to themselves as shareholders]
Equally, fundamental problems can arise because of the inevitable
limitations on the audit of a small company. The main objectives of an audit
could be summarised simplistically by five questions. Is the income
complete? Do all payments represent value to the company? Are the assets
over-stated? Are the liabilities under-stated? Do the accounts comply with
the law?
To answer these questions, the auditor makes an assessment of the company
and designs his work accordingly. He takes account of the track record of
the company and the directors, the reliability of the accounting records,
the consistency of accounting ratios, the systems of internal control, and
his judgment of the key areas of activity where effort should be focused.
Having made this assessment, he plans the mix of tests he will carry out.
Audit testing may include compliance tests on the control systems, review of
transactions, verification of the existence and valuations of assets and
liabilities by reference to documentation or by other corroborative
evidence, and a detailed review of the accounts. Any problems identified
must be discussed and resolved before an audit opinion can be given.
But because there is no internal control and division of duties in a husband
and wife company, a vital source of comfort for the auditor is not
available. It is not possible to corroborate evidence or rely on the systems
within the organisation.
Purchases and existence of assets can be confirmed through third parties,
but how does an auditor confirm that all income has been accounted for? If
he has reason to suspect that income is being diverted from the company by
the directors, he can only address his queries to them, which is not going
to contribute much to the audit process.
There is also the problem of dealing with discrepancies between the cash
account and bank statements. Unidentified payments could be legitimate
business expenses, but equally could be directors' personal expenses passed
through the books of the business.
Compliance with the Companies Act - particularly the requirement for
maintenance of proper accounting records - also causes difficulty. The
accountant often has to compensate for deficiencies in record-keeping by
meticulously constructing accounts from a jumble of paper. Accountants
describe these records as 'paper bag jobs', or old-fashioned 'spike audits'.
Having carried out this task and charged a fee for it, when he puts on his
auditors' hat the accountant is understandably reluctant to qualify his
client's accounts for a breach of the Act. But expressing a true and fair
view opinion in such a case may be stretching a point.
There used to be a form of audit report which referred to accepting
assurances from management in the absence of other corroborative evidence.
This was much used by small practitioners in small company accounts, but was
eventually viewed by the former Auditing Practices Committee as an excuse
for not doing an audit and was withdrawn. Although it was not the best of
vehicles, it was a form of tacit recognition that there are many situations
in small companies where an auditor is forced to rely heavily on information
given by the directors without other corroboration.
Objections have been raised to abolishing small company audits in the past
by third-party users - the banks and the Inland Revenue in particular - and
by other creditors, to whom the auditors owe no duty of care, but who
nevertheless make use of information in audited accounts.
A less onerous and more realistic reporting regime for small companies is
needed, and there are precedents both in the US and in the Antipodes.
Accounts of small companies are reviewed by qualified accountants, which
provides reasonable assurances to third parties without the need for a full
audit. As most of the accounts preparation work for small companies is
already done by practising accountants, this makes the process very much
simpler and more cost effective.
A similar system in the UK would mean that small companies would have some
obligations in exchange for the benefits of limited liability, without
incurring the costs of auditing and audit compliance. That would leave the
Auditing Practices Board and the Regulators to get on with the job of
dealing with the major problems.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Government warned on outlook for employment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ECONOMIC growth in Britain is expected to fall short of government
expectations in the medium term, making a significant fall in unemployment
from the current 2.7m unlikely during this decade, the National Institute of
Economic and Social Research warned yesterday.
The independent economic research body said in its quarterly report on the
economy that it believes economic growth is getting under way and will
gather pace in the second half of this year. The speed of recovery will,
however, be 'barely sufficient' to stop unemployment from rising.
The institute sees unemployment rising to 3m in 1993 and 1994 before a slow
decline sets in. The institute expects the jobless total in the UK to
average 2.7m between 1996 and 1999.
The institute's latest short-term forecast of 1 per cent growth this year
and 2.7 per cent next year differs little from the Treasury's forecast in
the Budget in March, and is only slightly more pessimistic about growth,
employment and inflation prospects for this year than in its previous
forecast in February.
However, the institute takes issue with the Treasury's belief that gross
domestic product will grow by 3.5 per cent a year over the fiscal years
1994-95 to 1996-97, with inflation subsiding to 2 per cent.
It says the scope for fiscal and monetary stimulus will be limited by the
state of the UK's public finances and constraints imposed by the European
exchange rate mechanism. The UK will not be able, for example, to benefit
from exchange rate depreciation as in earlier economic cycles.
Its projections show the economy growing at about 2.5 per cent, or close to
its long-term trend over the past 40 years, with inflation ranging between 3
per cent and 3.5 per cent a year.
The institute expects Britain to have a current-account deficit of about
Pounds 10bn, or close to 1.5 per cent of GDP, over the medium term. While
that should be easily financed, it implies gradual depletion of Britain's
strong net asset position abroad.
The institute argues that real short-term interest rates of about 6 per cent
are excessive for the UK and other EC member states such as France. The best
solution would be a substantial tightening of German fiscal policy - which
is outside the UK government's control.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Dutch education leads to higher output than UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRODUCTIVITY in the Netherlands is higher than in Britain because of the
superiority of Dutch education and training, according to National Institute
of Economic and Social Research.
In this month's National Institute Review, three researchers emphasise the
relative inferiority of British workers in skill levels.
Comparisons of manufacturing plants found Dutch productivity at least 30 per
cent higher in engineering and more than 15 per cent higher in biscuits.
The researchers - who include Mr Sig Prais, the institute's senior research
fellow - highlight three contrasts: higher emergency downtime in British
plants, reflecting poor standards of machine maintenance and diagnostic
skill; greater difficulty in maintaining product quality; and higher
shopfloor manning levels in Britain because of a comparative shortage of
workers able to switch between products and tasks.
The researchers say that Dutch schools place greater emphasis on 'early
systematic preparation for a career'; they achieve markedly higher standards
in maths and science; and offer a vocational route which about a third of
Dutch children follow after the age of fifteen.
The Dutch require companies to give all those aged 16 to 17 two days' leave
a week to attend college - but that affects only a minority because three
quarters of students aged 17 to 18 remain in full-time education, half at
intermediate-level vocational colleges.
'Dutch education has a much greater variety of secondary schools with highly
differentiated curricula for pupils of different career ambitions and
aptitudes,' they emphasise.
The conclusions are similar to the institute's comparisons of British and
German productivity. Explicit parallels between the Netherlands and Germany
are drawn in the latest paper, which describes the Dutch model of full-time
vocational schooling as 'a successful variant' of Germany's 'dual system' of
apprenticeship training.

FT  28 MAY 92 / New limit boosts unit trust Peps
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CHANGE in Personal Equity Plan rules has led to a record inflow into unit
trust Peps.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in the Budget that Pounds 6,000
could be invested in a unit or investment trust Pep from the start of the
1992-93 tax year.
The previous limit - except for investment trust new issues - had been
Pounds 3,000. Income and capital gains from Peps are tax-free.
About 230,000 unit trust Peps were opened between April 6, the start of the
tax year, and May 1, according to the Unit Trust Association. The Pounds
151m invested in April was a record monthly figure, pushing the total
invested in unit trust Peps to Pounds 2.3bn, spread across 996,000 accounts.
That is encouraging news for the unit trust industry, which has suffered
from poor performance in recent years. Over the past five years, a building
society high-interest account has produced a better performance than the
average unit trust.
Mr Gavin Grant, director of public affairs at the Unit Trust Association,
said: 'These figures prove we were right to argue there was a pent-up demand
for Peps and that the government was right to raise the limit for unit
trusts to Pounds 6,000.'

FT  28 MAY 92 / Plan on late debts backed
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHARLES BATCHELOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 20 trade associations and small business groups have expressed an
interest in a plan to develop pilot schemes to tackle late payment of debt,
the Department of Trade and Industry said yesterday.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, announced in his March Budget that the
government would provide up to Pounds 90,000 for three trade organisations
to run one-year pilot schemes such as late-payment 'hotlines' for their
members.
Trade associations have until June 15 to submit detailed proposals for
schemes, said Baroness Denton, minister for small businesses.
Initial interest has come from trade bodies representing the building
industry, printing, paint manufacturers, electrical contractors and computer
services. Three other groups, the Federation of Small Businesses, the Forum
of Private Business and the Confederation of British Industry's smaller
firms council, have also backed the idea.
Lady Denton said: 'Trade associations are often the first port of call for
small firms because they understand the nature of their business and its
market. Some are already working on payment issues but we want to expand
their number and the range of support they offer.'

FT  28 MAY 92 / Vocational tests body comes under attack
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE HEAD of the Business and Technology Education Council, Britain's largest
provider of vocational qualifications, yesterday launched a strong attack on
the quango responsible for carrying out government policies to promote
work-oriented education.
Mr Parry Rogers, Btec's chairman, condemned the National Council for
Vocational Qualifications as a 'prescriptive regulator' undermining the
quality of courses by over-regulation of their content and standard.
The NCVQ, under the leadership of Sir Bryan Nicholson, chairman of the Post
Office, has been charged by the government with simplifying and
co-ordinating the range of vocational qualifications on offer. It has a
power of validation - which gives it authority over the three main providers
of courses, as government funding for trainees is to be closely tied to
validated courses.
The NCVQ also has the task of ensuring that 80 per cent of the workforce is
covered by national vocational qualifications by the end of this year, and
of overseeing the introduction of the 'general vocational qualifications' -
intended to be work-oriented alternatives to A-levels in England and Wales -
announced in last year's white paper on education and training.
Tension between Btec and the NCVQ has been rising for some time, as the
design and validation process has proceeded. Btec's concern is not limited
to regulation: it is also thought to be worried about the speed of the
introduction of the GVQs - due to be piloted this autumn, and to be
generally available from autumn 1993.
Speaking at the launch of Btec's annual report yesterday, Mr Rogers likened
the NCVQ's approach to 'laying down the minimum specification for a car and
forbidding the manufacturer from offering a higher specification'.
He added: 'That attitude is daft in any circumstances; how much dafter when
done in the name of a government dedicated to market forces]'
Underlying the dispute are differences about the philosophy underlying
vocational courses. The NCVQ wishes to use courses to promote skill-based
training by employers, while Btec is anxious not to sacrifice the broader
educational role of courses.
Mr Rogers emphasised yesterday: 'I for one am unwilling to see Btec students
lose the chance to go on to degree courses where this is what the individual
wants and deserves.'
Concern that standards are at risk and that the NCVQ is adopting an
excessively competence-based approach is voiced far beyond Btec.
An oft-cited example of the trend is the newly validated Btec first diploma
in business and finance, claiming parity of esteem with GCSE, which
comprises competence tests such as filing 20 consecutive documents correctly
and answering 10 telephone calls accurately.

FORD is to sell its stake in AC Cars, the Surrey-based specialist sports car

near Weybridge, which holds the minority stake in AC Cars.
Ford yesterday gave no explanation for its decision to return the holding
but said it would continue to assist AC Cars with the supply of engines and
components for the AC Ace, a sports car that has been under development for
some time.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Banks 'should not put public first'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS MUST put the interests of their shareholders and customers above any
other considerations, including the interests of the public, the governor of
the Bank of England said last night.
Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton said banks are 'expected to function not only as
profit-conscious businesses but also as public-spirited institutions'. There
is likely to be a conflict between these different perceptions of banks'
roles where the banks are expected to absorb social costs, he said at the
City of London Polytechnic.
He added: 'One sees evidence of the view of banks as a special part of the
community in the local high street branch being the first port of call for
those seeking sponsorship for local charitable causes - even though the
answer (from the branch) may not nowadays be so regularly supportive as
perhaps it was in the past.'
Mr Leigh-Pemberton said that 'banks are - and inevitably behave as - bona
fide businesses' that seek to earn a profit. Profitable banks, in his view,
are in the interests of their customers and the economy.
Even so, it may not have been misplaced to expect the banks to act 'pro bono
publico' a decade ago, when the banks were sheltered from competition and
were therefore in theory able to earn substantial profits relatively easily.
That view is less tenable today, he said, given that banks now operate in an
'intensely competitive environment' and that the liberalisation of the
banking market was an act of government policy.
Banks, then, should not be expected to take on non-commercial activities
unless it can be demonstrated that such activity is in the long-term
interests of shareholders or customers.
Mr Leigh-Pemberton also reiterated the Bank's policy that, in a competitive
environment, it would be wrong for the authorities, the Bank and the
government, to 'rule out bank failures'.

NEW orders for durable goods rose for the fourth consecutive month in April,
the Commerce Department reported yesterday, Michael Prowse writes from
Washington.
Orders increased 1.4 per cent last month - more than expected in financial
markets - and by 4.6 per cent in the year to April. Gains were concentrated
in the volatile transport sector, where orders rose 6.1 per cent between
March and April. Excluding transport, orders fell 0.2 per cent.
Orders for non-defence capital goods, excluding aircraft and parts, fell 2.6
per cent last month, suggesting that civilian investment spending is likely
to remain sluggish in coming months.
Reuter adds: A prominent US economic forecasting group said its latest
national survey showed little likelihood of renewed recession, and saw
stronger 1992 growth than forecast.

MR Maurice Strong, secretary-general of the Earth Summit to be held in Rio
de Janeiro next week, said yesterday the role of business was crucial to the
summit's success. Industrial efficiency was the key to a better
environmental future, he added.
Addressing the International Chamber of Commerce conference on sustainable
development, Mr Strong said that future financial profits and attention to
the environment would be closely linked.
'Those who are defensive, reluctant, fighting yesterday's battles and
believing that the movement for sustainable development is at the fringes of
events, are the businesses which will fall by the wayside,' he warned.
'In some ways industry is ahead of government, but to move on it needs
government co-operation. I hope a primary result of the Earth Summit will be
an affirmation by governments of the need for a fiscal and regulatory
environment which allows industry to operate with sustainable behaviour.'
US companies emitted 11 per cent fewer toxic chemicals in 1990 than a year
earlier, the Environmental Protection Agency said yesterday, Reuter reports
from Washington.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Big primary wins for Bush and Clinton
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE penultimate round of presidential primaries saw three big wins for US
President George Bush and Governor Bill Clinton, strong informal support for
Mr Ross Perot and further evidence that congressional incumbents are up
against it this year.
Mr Bush scored 87 per cent in Arkansas in Tuesday's vote, 74 per cent in
Kentucky and 64 per cent in Idaho. Mr Clinton won 68 per cent in his home
state, 56 per cent in Kentucky and about 50 per cent in Idaho.
In Kentucky the Perot campaign had urged a vote for the uncommitted ticket,
and it duly materialised - 28 per cent on the Democratic side and 26 per
cent for the Republicans. In Arkansas it amounted to 18 per cent.
Updated tallies from last week's primary in Washington showed the Perot
write-in vote at about 20 per cent in both parties.
Mr Jerry Brown, the remaining Democratic challenger, failed to reach the 15
per cent threshold in Arkansas and Kentucky necessary to win convention
delegates. Mr Clinton took 64 of the 88 delegates at stake, and is now only
about 150 short of the 2,145 needed for the nomination.
This he will undoubtedly secure next week in the final primary round, which
includes California. Mr Brown's challenge in the state which he once
governed appears to be fading fast. However, most local polls suggest that
Mr Perot leads both Mr Clinton and Mr Bush, not only in the west but also in
industrial states like Ohio, which holds party primaries next Tuesday.
Most striking in the last round were the primary defeats of two-long serving
Democratic congressman - Mr Bill Alexander in Arkansas and Mr Carroll
Hubbard in Kentucky. Both had been caught up in March's congressional
banking scandal, when it emerged that many congressmen had written bad
cheques at the House of Representatives' bank.
The number of incumbent senators and congressmen who have either been
defeated or announced retirement now exceeds 60.
Predictions of the final toll range from 100 to 150, which would be a
post-war high. Republicans hope the current comfortable Democratic majority
in both houses could be at risk.
The composition of the new congress would assume extraordinary importance in
the event that no candidate wins a majority of the electoral college in the
presidential election. The rise of Mr Perot has now rendered this thinkable,
if still less than probable.
Should this happen, the constitution stipulates that the newly elected House
choose the president and the Senate the vice-president, with each state,
regardless of its size, casting a single vote. Nothing like this has taken
place since 1824.
The Republican party, meanwhile, suffered the unusual experience of a
bruising public debate over its long-standing commitment to restricting
abortion. The platform committee, meeting in Salt Lake City, heard arguments
not only from pro-life advocates but from the increasingly vocal group of
pro-choice Republican women who sense that adamant opposition to abortion
could be an electoral liability this year.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Guilty plea may lead to BNL trial cancellation: Bush
administration likely to welcome move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-awaited Banca Nazionale del Lavoro (BNL) trial is likely to be
cancelled next week following an expected guilty plea by Mr Christopher
Drogoul, the former manager of the bank's Atlanta branch. Mr Drogoul is the
last remaining defendant facing trial.
The cancellation of the trial, which was recently postponed until June 22,
is likely to be greeted with relief by the Bush administration, which has
come under fire in recent weeks from congressional Democrats. They have
accused the government of covering up its alleged knowledge of the more than
Dollars 4bn (Pounds 2.2bn) of clandestine loans made by BNL Atlanta to Iraq.
More than half of the unauthorised loans from BNL were used by Iraq's
President Saddam Hussein to fund development of nuclear, chemical and
ballistic missile projects.
Ms Sheila Tyler, the lawyer acting for Mr Drogoul, said last night the
former BNL manager would enter a guilty plea next Tuesday morning, in a
hearing before Judge Marvin Shoob in Atlanta. An aide to Judge Shoob
confirmed that Mr Drogoul would enter the plea.
As Mr Drogoul makes his statement next Tuesday, a hearing of the House
judiciary committee in Washington will discuss the merits of seeking a
special prosecutor to investigate whether there has been a cover-up of US
involvement in the BNL affair and other aspects of the arming of Iraq.
Ms Tyler is expected to make use of Mr Drogoul's eventual sentencing hearing
to argue that he was a minor player in a banking operation that had covert
US government approval. Whether this will sway the judge to reduce Mr
Drogoul's prison sentence - which could be as high as 30 years - is
uncertain.
'It is clear to me that my client was merely a small fish in a larger
operation. It is unfair for Mr Drogoul to take all the blame,' Ms Tyler said
yesterday.
Judge Shoob's only public comment on the BNL affair was in remarks he made
at a pre-trial hearing on April 27. 'In reviewing all the documents that
have been made available to me, there is nothing that remotely indicates
that he (Mr Drogoul) is the sole moving party in this transaction,' the
judge said.
'I don't see how Mr Drogoul could have handled this whole thing without some
type of assistance.'
Mr Drogoul was indicted 15 months ago along with 10 others on charges
ranging from conspiracy and fraud to money laundering and tax evasion. The
US has no hope of securing four top Iraqi government officials who were
among those indicted, while the other defendants have pleaded guilty.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US AND EC officials met in Washington yesterday to try to end their farm
subsidy impasse that has blocked a 108-nation effort to reform the world's
trading system, Reuter reports from Washington.
EC members last week agreed to reform their farm policy by cutting
government payments to farmers, but the US said there also had to be cuts in
government export subsidies and fewer curbs on food imports.
A US official acknowledged the importance of the cuts in internal subsidies,
but said: 'We're anxious to see if there can be progress on export subsidies
and market access'.
EC refusal to agree to deep cuts in farm subsidies, as demanded by the US
and other food exporters, has hampered progress towards an overall Gatt
accord. Mr Frans Andriessen, EC external relations commissioner, was
yesterday pressing the case that the EC had been flexible on subsidies and
it was now the US's turn.
Mr Andriessen yesterday met US Secretary of State James Baker, Mr Edward
Madigan, agriculture secretary, and Mrs Carla Hills, US trade
representative. A US official said a further meeting might be scheduled for
today if warranted.
Mr Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general, said on Monday that time was
running out for meeting a December deadline to wind up the talks
successfully.

FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Turkey-Russian debt pact paves way for gas
deal
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TURKEY and Russia have agreed terms for settling an outstanding debt owed by
Moscow, paving the way for a new gas trade accord, worth Dollars 290m
(Pounds 163.8m) in 1991.
During a two-day visit to Moscow this week, Mr Suleyman Demirel, Turkish
prime minister, won assurance from Mr Yegor Gaidar, Russia's first deputy
prime minister, that Russia would repay a Dollars 35m debt over the next
three months.
In addition, Russia has agreed a Turkish request that proceeds of the gas
trade be paid into the Turkish Eximbank in Ankara, rather than the
Vnesheconombank, the bank through which former Soviet foreign debt is paid.
Under this week's deal, Russia assumes contractual responsibility for the
natural gas contract first agreed with the former Soviet Union in 1984.
However, the two sides have still finalise details on changes on both the
price and volume of the gas shipped.
Turkish-Russian trade, worth Dollars 1.7bn in 1990, collapsed with the
dissolution of the Soviet Union.
This week's talks were aimed at finding new ways to facilitate the accord
under which Russia is obliged to dedicate 70 per cent of the hard-currency
proceeds to purchase Turkish goods and services and 30 per cent as a free
exchange portion to repay credits extended by the Turkish Eximbank.
Turkey is projected to face a domestic power shortage, and has asked Russia
to boost gas volumes from the current 4bn-5bn cu metres to 8bn to satisfy
growing energy demand.
Russia is seeking to renegotiate the price under the original contract,
using central European benchmark crude prices rather than Mediterranean
prices, on which the present arrangement is based.
This year, Russia is committed under best-effort terms, to buy Dollars
140m-worth of Turkish goods and services.
Turkish officials say Russia has also pledged to buy an extra Dollars
73m-worth of goods, representing amounts unrealised from 1991.
Turkey's Eximbank, which has extended more than Dollars 1bn-worth of export
credits to the Soviet Union, says that in June it will renew its credit
programme with Russia.
All new Eximbank credits to Russia were frozen after Vnesheconombank's
moratorium on its Dollars 60bn debt to western banks last year.

FT  28 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Canadian grain for Russia hit by cash
shortage
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CANADIAN grain exports to Russia have slowed to a trickle because of
Moscow's inability to pay foreign shipowners and a ban imposed by Ottawa on
many Russian-owned vessels to counter an infestation of leaf-eating moths.
Russia's shortage of hard currency has already caused Canadian authorities
to impound at least one fully-laden vessel, and appears to be discouraging
other owners from sending ships to Canadian ports.
The slowdown in shipments to Canada's biggest grain export market has also
caused a domestic transport crisis. About half the grain freighters plying
the Great Lakes are at present idle, and several hundred crew members and
grain handlers have been laid off.
The Canadian Grain Transportation Agency (GTA), which co-ordinates
deliveries to the ports, yesterday cut its estimate of June exports. Total
shipments through the Great Lakes port of Thunder Bay are now projected at
0.5m tonnes, half the volume expected a month ago. The GTA has cut its
projection of export volumes through west coast ports from 1.7m tonnes to
1.36m tonnes. Canada exported a total 7.2m tonnes of wheat and 1.2m tonnes
of barley to the former Soviet Union in the season which ended last July.
Although Canada has extended a CDollars 1.5bn (Pounds 714m) line of credit
to Russia for wheat purchases, this does not cover shipping costs. A
spokesman for the Canadian Wheat Board said yesterday that Russia's
inability to pay for foreign-owned vessels appears to be the main problem.
Use of Russian ships is limited by a Canadian government order banning
vessels in port in the Russian Far East during the Asian gypsy-moth spawning
season. The moths, voracious foliage eaters, are a threat to west coast
forests in the US and Canada. An official with Morlines Maritime Agency,
which handles the bulk of wheat shipments to Russia, said that Export Khleb,
the Russian grain-purchasing agency, has not chartered any vessels to load
in a Canadian port before June 3.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Gadaffi regime seen as least of many evils: Showdown with
the west strengthens Libyan leader's hand
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TRIPOLI
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE souks and the narrow, rundown streets of Tripoli's old town the mood
of Libya's organised revolutionary youth is still defiant.
Under a brightly painted billboard displaying a romantic portrait of Colonel
Muammer Gadaffi, or 'the leader' as he is known in Libya, crowds of angry
young men gather to vent their rage.
'Even if America and England bomb Tripoli again and kill our people we will
not give up,' said one man. 'They are just trying to persecute us and we
won't agree to their demands. Never.'
But in the upper echelons of Libya's internationally isolated ruling clique
the defiance once shared by the revolutionary militants on the streets is
crumbling.
Six weeks after the United Nations imposed air sanctions on Libya for its
support of alleged terrorists and its possible involvement in the bombing of
a Pan Am passenger jet over Lockerbie, Scotland in 1988, Col Gadaffi's
23-year-old regime is seeking a face-saving compromise with the west.
Intensive efforts by Arab states, in particular Egypt, have helped to push
the regime towards conciliation. Cairo, with up to 1m Egyptians working in
Libya, is particularly anxious to avoid any destabilising fallout from
conflict between Tripoli and the world.
In the face of such pressure Libya has already announced it would implement
a UN security council resolution which, in the words of the official
statement, would mean 'the categorical renunciation of terrorism in all its
forms and whatever its sources are'.
The Libyans have agreed to cut all links with terrorist groups and invite UN
monitors to verify that Libya was not training any terrorists on its soil.
Col Gadaffi has also indicated he is willing to disclose details of Libyan
links with the Irish Republican Army in Britain.
The problem with Libya's latest position is that it still leaves open the
matter of the two suspects in the airliner bombing. The UN has said they
must stand trial in Britain or the US.
In an interview, Col Gadaffi said that the matter did not concern the Libyan
state but was a problem for the two men and their lawyers.
Another possible face-saving way out for Col Gadaffi is the national debate
which is being held in the 'people's conferences' which will decide within
two weeks whether to change Libyan law to allow the two suspects to be
extradited - a decision which will appear to have been taken outside Col
Gadaffi's circle.
For the moment the impact of air sanctions against Libya appears largely
psychological. Life in Tripoli is normal. Foreign businessmen, mostly oil
men, continue to arrive in the sleepy capital. The markets are full of fresh
fruit, vegetables, eggs and meat. Ships and passenger ferries glide across
Tripoli bay into the port.
Most Libyan businessmen have adapted easily to making the four-hour drive on
good tarmac roads to Djerba, in neighbouring Tunisia, to catch an
international flight, or to taking a catamaran to Malta.
However, faced with the prospect of either maritime sanctions or an embargo
on Libyan oil exports, which provides more than 90 per cent of the country's
Dollars 3bn foreign earnings, many Libyan businessmen and political
observers believe that the two suspects will stand trial in the west,
probably in Scotland.
'Libya is a small country dependent on the west for experts and technology,'
said one Libyan businessman. 'There is no way we can risk being cut off even
though most people here believe it is neither fair nor legal. It's just a
matter of time and finding an honourable truce.'
However, Tripoli's business community complains that since last November the
Lockerbie issue has dominated the government's time and held back a sweeping
economic liberalisation and privatisation programme which included laws to
privatise banking and increase allocation of foreign exchange to the private
sector. They say it has also strengthened the hand of the myriad and
sinister security agencies by resurrecting the fears of foreign military
intervention.
Optimistic businessmen believe that the regime, faced by bureaucratic
incompetence, economic failure, a burgeoning black market for the Libyan
dinar and its own unpopularity, was prepared to edge away from the socialist
experiments set out in Col Gadaffi's 'Green Book'.
More than anything else they fear that a western-prompted change in the
regime, which many Libyans believe is the real motive behind the current
showdown, would unleash the suppressed fundamentalist Islamic movement which
Col Gadaffi has kept at bay and upset the delicate tribal balance of power
he has maintained.
'There is no organised or visible political opposition in Libya and no
independent institutions,' said one US-educated university lecturer. 'The
revolution has swept all that away. If Gadaffi went tomorrow there would be
chaos - perhaps even civil war.
'This regime may be considered by the west as evil but for us Libyans it is
the least of many evils.'
On the streets the support for 'the leader' is less pragmatic. Despite the
squandering of Libya's oil wealth and the brutal excesses of the security
forces, many Libyans, particularly the previously underdeveloped Bedouin
peoples and the eastern tribes, have benefited from the revolution's
progress in education, housing and health. Col Gadaffi's apparent unswerving
support for the Palestine Liberation Organisation also continues to exercise
a powerful pull on the 'Arab masses'.
Western diplomats agree that the current crisis has strengthened Col
Gadaffi's hand both inside and outside the regime. 'It would be a great
mistake for the west to think that pressure will topple Gadaffi for a better
regime,' said one western envoy. 'He is bowed, not broken.'

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A RABBI was stabbed to death by a Palestinian at a Jewish settlement in the
Gaza Strip and a Palestinian woman was shot dead by soldiers in the West
Bank yesterday.
They were the latest victims in the surge of violence in Israel, the
occupied territories and Lebanon which has overtaken the campaign for the
Israeli general election on June 23.
The attack on Rabbi Shimon Biran, a resident of the settlement of Kfar
Darom, followed a similar fatal knife attack by a Gazan Arab on a
15-year-old Israeli schoolgirl in Bat Yam, near Tel Aviv, on Sunday.
The killings, combined with a wave of Israeli air strikes on Moslem
fundamentalist guerrillas in Lebanon, provoked heated debate between
Israel's ruling Likud party and the opposition Labour party over security,
traditionally a central issue in Israeli elections.
Gangs of armed Jewish settlers in Gaza went on the rampage against
Palestinian property and beat at least two people in revenge for the Rabbi's
death. The army doubled a three-day order closing all exits to Israel from
Gaza. Later, in an unconnected incident in the West Bank town of Jenin, a
55-year-old woman was shot dead when soldiers opened fire after their bus
was stoned.
Labour has strongly attacked the Likud over the stabbings, saying that the
government was neither in control of security nor making progress towards a
peace settlement that might ease the problem. In the past, Labour tended to
lose out to the more hardline Likud on security matters. But under Mr
Yitzhak Rabin, a former chief of staff and defence minister, it now has
greater confidence in confronting the issue.
Mr Rabin has publicly warned the government against trying to exploit
security concerns for electoral gain following a spate of air strikes in
Lebanon of unusual ferocity, in one of which two small girls and their
mother were killed.
Mr Moshe Arens, the defence minister, yesterday strongly denied that
political considerations formed any part of operational decisions. But, in a
briefing for foreign journalists, he came close to admitting that the Likud
might benefit from incidents like those of the past few days. In the past,
he said, such events had produced a 'more realistic view' among Israelis
about the dangers facing them and the need for strong government.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S industrial production fell last month for the seventh month in a
row, reflecting the continuing weakness in the country's economy.
Industrial output fell 5.5 per cent compared with the month in 1991,
according to figures published yesterday by the Ministry of International
Trade and Industry (Miti). Despite the decline in production, inventories
rose 6.2 per cent year-on-year.
A senior official from the ministry said the figures indicated that the
current economic downturn could last longer than had been expected.
The government - including Miti - has been forecasting a recovery in the
economy in the second half of the year. If inventory levels remain high,
companies will be unwilling to raise output in time for the government's
hopes to be realised.
Mr Paul Summerville, an economist at Jardine Fleming, the securities house,
said yesterday's figures were an unpleasant surprise. 'Production is falling
but inventories are still rising. I don't know anyone who expected that at
this stage.'
On a month-to-month seasonally-adjusted basis, Japanese industrial
production rose by 0.7 per cent, the first increase in seven months.
However, shipments fell 0.5 per cent, indicating that demand is still weak.
After falling steadily since the beginning of the year on a month-to-month
basis, inventory levels did not change at all in April.
The index of inventories to sales rose 0.7 per cent.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN BOND (pictured left), the bankrupt Australian entrepreneur, told a
court yesterday that he asked for an ADollars 20m (Pounds 8.3m) success fee
for helping to arrange an ADollars 370m rescue of Rothwells merchant bank
hit by the 1987 global stock market crash.
But he said there was no agreement on the fee before he discussed the rescue
with Mr Brian Coppin, a West Australian businessman who had been asked to
contribute to the rescue. Mr Bond, the former chairman of Bond Corporation
Holdings, denies dishonestly inducing Mr Coppin to deal in securities by
concealing the existence of the fee.
Giving evidence on the third day of his trial in the Western Australian
district court, Mr Bond said he was in Rome discussing a property deal when
he was informed that Rothwells merchant bank was facing liquidity problems.
Mr Bond said he discussed the Perth-based bank's problems by telephone with
Mr Laurie Connell, the chairman, and agreed to return to Australia to help
organise a rescue in which the state government would participate.
He said the stock market crash had created a climate in which the failure of
Rothwells could have had an impact on other Australian companies, including
other banks.
Rothwells collapsed in November 1988 and is the focus of a Royal Commission
inquiry into relationships between politicians and businessmen in Western
Australia. More than 20 people face criminal charges, including Mr Connell.
Mr Bond said he also discussed the rescue with Mr Brian Burke, the Labor
premier. Bond Corp agreed to sub-underwrite ADollars 37.5m, subsequently
reduced to ADollars 25m, of a ADollars 150m share issue to recapitalise
Rothwells.
Bond Corp helped Wardley Australia, the stockbrokers, put together a
refinancing deal in which Mr Connell contributed ADollars 70m in
subordinated debt, backed by the share issue.
The state government guaranteed a ADollars 150m loan facility provided by
National Australia Bank.
Mr Bond said he asked Mr Coppin to sub-underwrite the share issue for
ADollars 20m, later reduced to ADollars 8m. He said he believed the
agreement was 'a sound investment', partly because of state government
support.
Mr Bond said the suggestion that Bond Corp should be paid a fee was raised
by Mr Peter Beckwith, Bond Corp's managing director. Mr Bond said he
suggested ADollars 20m, but Mr Connell said that was 'a bit much'.
Mr Connell said he would suggest a fee of ADollars 16m to other Rothwells
directors, and report back to Mr Beckwith, Mr Bond said.
He heard no more about the fee until two weeks later, when he was told
Rothwells had agreed to pay ADollars 16m. Mr Bond said Mr Coppin made no
complaint when told about the fee. He said he had concealed nothing and had
not been dishonest.
The trial is expected to conclude later this week.

THE AFRICAN National Congress (ANC) begins a four-day policy conference in
Johannesburg today in which it will attempt to flesh out its view of the
policies to be pursued by a future democratic government in South Africa.
Although the aim of the conference is to produce policy guidelines rather
than details, it should provide valuable information about ANC intentions
and, as it will be attended by about 700 delegates, will be a useful
barometer of grassroots militancy.
The conference takes place against a background of strained relations
between the ANC and the government following the stalemate earlier this
month at the constitutional talks held under the auspices of the Convention
for a Democratic South Africa. Yesterday, the law and order minister, Mr
Hernus Kriel, said that the government's 'honeymoon' with the ANC was over.
In response to ANC claims that President F W de Klerk condoned township
violence when the victims were black, the minister said: 'It can be expected
that in the future there will be reaction against unfounded attacks on the
government and especially on the state president.'
The business community will be watching to see the extent to which the ANC
has shed its socialist baggage.
Indications are, however, that many difficult questions, like
nationalisation and taxation policy, may be referred to specialist
committees for study.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Death toll rises in Lebanon fighting
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE TOLL from eight days of fighting between Israel and the pro-Iranian Shia
Moslem Hizbollah in Lebanon rose yesterday to 20 killed - half of them
civilians - and 55 wounded, provoking the US State Department into issuing
its customary appeal for restraint.
The risks for all sides are considerable if the conflict is allowed to
escalate. Casualties incurred by Israel if it launched a ground offensive
could not easily be borne by a government fighting an election campaign.
Hizbollah would risk losing Syrian support and the already strained
tolerance of the Lebanese if it incited more massive Israeli reprisals by
breaking its February pledge not to fire Katyusha rockets into Israel.
And despite a statement by Mr Farouk Al-Sharaa, the Syrian foreign minister,
that Syria was 'ready to confront Israel if it imposes war', Syrian soldiers
were reportedly ordered not to fire their surface-to-air missiles this week
at the first Israeli jets to fly over their positions in Baalbek in two
years.
Meanwhile, the government in Beirut appears to have little say in what is
happening in the south of its country. While the cabinet debates the issue,
thousands more refugees have taken to the road and the country's currency
and economy have been further undermined by the instability in the south.
Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, Iran's spiritual leader, this week exhorted the
Lebanese 'to resist the savage Zionist aggression'. Tehran has invested 10
years of effort, many millions of dollars and its revolutionary credentials
in the Hizbollah. To abandon them now would be humiliating for the Islamic
Republic.
Syria might be prepared to limit the activities of Hizbollah if a deal could
be struck with Israel for the return of the Golan Heights, but Arab
diplomats say Damascus is disillusioned by Israel's refusal to trade land
for peace and is not about to make conciliatory gestures while the peace
talks are in the doldrums. Hizbollah members privately acknowledge they
would be satisfied with an end to the Israeli occupation of southern
Lebanon.
Although Katyusha rockets were fired into northern Israel in the aftermath
of the Israeli assassination of Sheikh Abbas Musawi in February, Hizbollah
has otherwise limited its operations to Israeli and Israeli surrogate
targets inside the borders of Lebanon.
The US and Israel say that the disarming of Hizbollah must precede any
consideration of an Israeli withdrawal from southern Lebanon, despite a
14-year-old United Nations Security Council resolution requiring the
'immediate and unconditional withdrawal' of all Israeli forces from Lebanon.

FT  28 MAY 92 / India needs to double output of electricity over 15 years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANK GRAY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDIA MUST increase its electricity generating capacity by 50 per cent in
the next five years and double it from existing levels in the next 15 years
if it is to stand any chance of keeping pace with demand, a senior Indian
government energy official said yesterday.
Mr Shri Kalp Nath Rai, minister of state for power, told the Financial Times
Asian electricity conference that an unprecedented boost in private power
generation was the only way these targets could be achieved.
State electricity expansion targets have had to be sharply curtailed because
of lack of funds and an ambitious legislative reform programme has been put
in place to improve the role of the private sector in supplying electricity.
India had a total of 70,000MW of electricity supply capacity, but a further
48,000 needed to be added in five years and 142,000 in the next 15 year if
energy shortages were to be eliminated, he said.
But the recently completed eighth five-year plan had had to be revised
downward to provide for a capacity rise out of state funds of just 31,000MW.
The rest would have to be made up by a fast expanding private sector.
Mr Rai said that India was better placed to meet the electricity supply
challenge because, unlike most Asian nations, its power sector was already
mixed between federal, state and private sector power utilities  - the last
represented by such companies as Tata Electric and Calcutta Electricity
Supply, among others.
But until last year, the private sector was severely hampered from expansion
by the Indian electricity supply act, which protected state power companies.
This has now been changed to allow widespread expansion, including up to 100
per cent foreign equity participation in private power projects. The
government was now considering private sector proposals to add more than
9,000mw, equally divided between the Indian private sector and foreign
investors.
Mr Rai's call for private sector investment was matched by that of Mr Shahd
Nafeez Ahmed, Pakistan's private sector director water and power.
Pakistan's electricity supply policy had been virtually turned upside down
in the last year, a move which will mean more independent power producers
being able to set up in Pakistan to operate alongside the Water and Power
Development Authority, the state utility, and the eventual breakup of WAPDA
itself, Mr Hafeez Ahmed said.
Pakistan now had 8,312MW of capacity, which was l,800MW below what was
needed to avoid regular blackouts. To end this, several private sector
build-operate-transfer (BOT) projects were now about to be implemented or
were being considered. Chief among these was the 1,292MW Hab River oil-fired
power project outside Karachi.
Start up of work was expected in July, but only after more than four years
of negotiations between a Euro-Japanese consortium and the Pakistan
government.

<TEXT>
THE BOMBAY high court yesterday ordered the liquidation of Bank of Karad, a
small private bank which owes more than Rs4bn (Pounds 76m) to Standard
Chartered Bank of the UK.
At the request of the Reserve Bank of India, the central bank, the court
appointed Mr SN Lele, an official of Bank of Baroda, as provisional
liquidator for Bank of Karad.
The reserve bank had already appointed another Bank of Baroda official as
chairman and asked other top executives to resign after it emerged that Bank
of Karad, which had capital of Rs4.5m and deposits of Rs731.8m at March
1991, had issued Rs9bn of bankers' receipts, a form of IOUs.
Bankers' receipts are at the heart of the scandal afflicting India's
financial markets. The receipts, through which a bank pledged later delivery
of securities already paid for, were used as collateral to fund share
purchases in Bombay's then-booming stock market.
However, many of the securities supposedly backing the receipts did not
exist or had not been purchased.
Officials of Standard Chartered were surprised at the speed with which the
Reserve Bank moved to liquidation proceedings. The UK bank is expected to
file its claims before the Bombay high court today.
Indian legal experts say that the chances of Standard Chartered recovering
even a part of the Rs4bn in the immediate future are bleak. The bank has
made a Pounds 50m provision for possible losses.
Standard Chartered in Bombay refused to comment on the bank's exposure to
unreconciled bankers' receipts for the interbank transactions with another
bank, Metropolitan Cooperative Bank, which issued receipts for an estimated
Rs5bn.
The Economic Times, an Indian newspaper, reported that the receipts were
issued to Standard Chartered.
Mr S Venkitaramanan, Reserve Bank governor, said action was being taken
against Metropolitan Cooperative Bank.

AFGHAN interim President Sibghatullah Mojaddedi yesterday hinted that he
might not step down when his two-month term of office expires at the end of
next month. Public demand, he said, might require him to continue.
His remarks come at a time when Afghans are debating whether the
continuation of his term would promote peace in the embattled country. Under
current arrangements, he is due to hand over to a new administration prior
to national elections.
In Islamabad on the second day of a visit to Pakistan Mr Mojaddedi said many
were asking him to remain, though it was not his intention to stay on for as
long as two years.
Afghan mujahideen guerrillas who took power in Kabul late last month may
have killed and tortured dozens of former government officials and security
force members, Amnesty International said yesterday, Reuter reports from
London.
Amnesty, the London-based human rights organisation, said it had received
unconfirmed reports of guerrillas killing up to 40 security force members
who had been taken prisoner on April 30.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S government and opposition yesterday failed to narrow their
differences on the crucial question of how to finance German unification,
whether by increased taxation or drastic budget cuts.
Top-level talks between Chancellor Helmut Kohl, his coalition partners, and
the opposition Social Democrats (SPD) left the two sides 'living in two
different worlds', according to Mr Bjorn Engholm, the SPD leader.
Yet the leading political parties, shaken by a series of election results
showing growing public disenchantment with all of them, agreed to co-operate
on two key subsidiary issues: reforming property laws to encourage private
investment in the former East Germany; and accelerating moves to control the
influx of asylum-seekers and refugees.
They also agreed to ensure the necessary constitutional changes to ratify
the European Community treaty on political and monetary union - while
leaving the fine details to negotiations between the central government and
the 16 federal states.
Mr Theo Waigel, the finance minister, was adamant he could control the
government's budget deficit through rigorous savings, keeping growth in
public spending down to an overall 3 per cent, and just 2.5 per cent for
central government, until 1995.
Mr Engholm countered with a grim warning that an array of costs was being
underestimated, including compensation for east German property owners,
cleaning up the environment, aiding eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union, and paying more money to the EC budget. The SPD proposes a levy on
enterprises and the higher-paid to cut the budget deficit, forecast this
year at DM42bn.( Pounds 14.2bn)
One positive sign was an agreement to legislate to ensure investment in the
east was protected from confusion over property claims by former owners.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Commission yesterday revised downwards to 1.75 per cent its
estimate of this year's real growth in the European economy from the 2.3 per
cent it predicted six months ago.
At the same time, it predicted a further rise in the Community's
unemployment rate from 9.5 per cent this year to 9.75 per cent in 1993.
The Commission said the slower-than-expected recovery in the European
economy - already reflected in similar forecasts by other international
organisations - would have consequences for EC states' efforts to meet the
'convergence' criteria, set in the Maastricht treaty, for eventual monetary
union.
The Commission believes average EC inflation will come down from 5.2 per
cent in 1991 to 4.5 per cent this year, but adds that 'greater progress
might reasonably have been expected given the tight stance of monetary
policy and depressed economic activity'.
By 1993 the average should fall to 4 per cent, it says.
This will put the UK, and the seven countries which have kept their
currencies within the exchange rate mechanism's narrow band, within 1.5
percentage points of the three least inflationary economies - one of the
Maastricht convergence tests.
But slack growth will also push up net government borrowing from 4.3 per
cent of Community gross domestic product to an average of 4.75 per cent this
year, where it will stay in 1993.
Maastricht set as a goal - though not an absolute requirement - for monetary
union that countries should keep their borrowing to within 3 per cent of
GDP.
Only Denmark, France, Ireland and Luxembourg will pass this test in 1993,
though the first stab at monetary union is not due until the end of 1996.
The sharpest deterioration is expected in the UK, whose public deficit is
expected to rise by more than three percentage points over 1991 to 1993 to
5.25 per cent.
Germany's budget deficit, which is causing its partners such concern because
of its knock-on effect on their interest rates, is forecast to rise half a
percentage point to 3.25 per cent this year, with a slight fall expected
next year.
The recent tail-off in the creation of new jobs will end next year, the
Commission believes, but this will not be enough to prevent the overall
jobless rate rising next year.

A general strike in protest at government economic policies is expected to
cause widespread air, rail and road traffic chaos in Spain today, Peter
Bruce writes from Madrid.
Unions, angry at deep cuts in unemployment benefits, have insisted they will
not provide public transport services ordered by the government after the
two sides failed to agree on minimum services. The battle over minimum
services has become the immediate focus of the strike, which is due to last
from 5am until noon. Its success, both sides concede, will initially be
measured by the number of people able to get to work.
Madrid has set minimum commuter train services at 40 per cent of normal
service and, in the capital, insists 40 per cent of public buses should run.
Iberia, the Spanish national airline, said it had cancelled nearly 100
domestic and international flights for the morning.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Belt-tightening of EC integration underlies labour unrest:
Governments and employers can no longer rely on deficits and devaluation to
ride wage rises
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE 'hot spring' of continental Europe's labour unrest reaches its climax
over the next two days with a half-day general strike in Spain today and
widespread disruption expected in Italy tomorrow.
Over the past few weeks action, or threatened action, by German workers has
stolen most of the headlines but there have also been strike waves in France
and the Netherlands.
If there is any trend underlying these disputes it is labour disquiet at the
belt-tightening consequences of European economic integration.
With Europe's main currencies increasingly tied together, the structurally
weaker countries with inflationary bargaining systems, especially in
southern Europe, can no longer keep their prices competitive with the help
of devaluation. Employers in the exporting sectors thus have to tackle
excessive wage rises directly.
At the same time governments are under increasing pressure to reduce public
sector deficits, and thus control public sector pay, if they want to be
founding members of European Monetary Union (EMU).
In Spain and Italy the link is direct and public. Today's Spanish strikes
were triggered by the socialist government's decision to reduce unemployment
benefits in the Convergence Plan it has drawn up to enable Spain to join
EMU. The other main bone of contention is the government's intention - also
in its Convergence Plan - to freeze subsidies to state industries, at
current levels which will force many big employers to make redundancies.
In Italy, where there will be strikes on the railways and possibly in the
engineering sector, the argument is over the reform of the Scala Mobile,
which index-linked wages. The unions recognise that formal wage indexation
is unrealistic and agreed that the system should go into abeyance at the
start of this year. However they believe that one extra month is payable
under the old system and are flexing their muscles before talks with
Confindustria, the industrialists association, next month.
In Germany the public sector pay dispute, resolved earlier this month, was
also indirectly about convergence. The German government has to keep a tight
rein on public spending to be able to pay for reunification without
disrupting the route to EMU.
The German unions recognise that and privately even accept that real
earnings in west Germany will have to fall over the next few years to allow
living standards in east Germany to be raised. However both the public
sector workers and I G Metall in the engineering sector believe that the
costs of reunification should be shared more fairly and that high earners
and business should pay more.
This is a political argument. The unions are taking it up because of the
weakness of the There is a similar politicisation of the unions in Spain
and, to a lesser extent, Italy. In Spain the government is nominally
socialist but it is pursuing conservative policies with little effective
political opposition. For that reason the two main union confederations -
the socialist UGT and the communist CCOO - believe they have a political
mission to defend labour.
In Spain the unions are far less able to fulfil that role than in Germany or
Italy where numerically and institutionally the unions remain much stronger.
In Spain and France the unions organise scarcely 10 per cent of their
respective workforces. Some progress is being made in Spain and Italy to
reduce the political and religious rifts within the union movement but in
France the problems seem as bad as ever.
In France, the communist CGT is losing its majority on some of the most
politically important works councils in France, such as at Renault, and is
struggling to keep its power at the RATP Parisian public transport
authority.
Mr Franz Steinkuhler, leader of Germany's I G Metall, caused dismay among
French union officials when he observed recently that the French unions are
the weakest and most divided in Europe. As convergence pressures mount in
Europe's labour markets the French government may have reason to be
thankful.

FRANCE had a record FFr7.79bn (Pounds 780m) trade surplus last month, thanks
to continued growth in industrial exports. It was the fourth consecutive
monthly surplus and brings to FFr12.8bn the seasonally corrected surplus
since the beginning of the year - a sharp swing from the FFr16.49bn deficit
in the same period of 1991.
Exports last month rose by 2.6 per cent over the March level to FFr109.66bn,
while imports fell by 3.6 per cent to FFr101.87bn. The surplus on the
industrial account was FFr5.65bn, against a FFr119m deficit in March.
Mr Michel Sapin, finance minister, said the surplus underlined French
companies' competitivness. Their performance has been strongest in other
European Community countries, with which France recorded a FFr6.03bn surplus
last month, after a FFr2.26bn surplus in March.

<TEXT>
BRITAIN and Czechoslovakia yesterday agreed to intensify political and
military co-operation to draw the former communist state gradually into the
west's security framework.
A joint declaration signed by Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, and
President Vaclav Havel also laid to rest the lingering ghost of the pre-war
cession to Germany of the Czech Sudetenland. The declaration explicitly
recognised that the Munich agreement which the Czechoslovak government was
forced to sign with Adolf Hitler in 1938 was null.
Previous British prime ministers have apologised for their country's
signature of the Munich agreement. But the formal renunciation, requested by
Mr Havel, reflects the continuing concern of central European countries that
the west should underwrite their present borders.
Mr Major, whose visit to Prague and Bratislava yesterday embraced talks with
the Czech and Slovak leaders contesting next month's elections, again
underlined his commitment to eventual EC membership for Czechoslovakia,
Poland and Hungary.
The declaration stated: 'We are determined to co-operate in helping to
create the political and economic conditions necessary for the accession of
the Czech and Slovak federal republic to the European Community.'
Speaking at a joint news conference with Mr Havel, Mr Major indicated that
Britain was not ready at present to give the same commitment to back
Prague's aspirations to join Nato. The joint declaration said the two
governments would intensify consultations on the security issues dealt with
by Nato and the Western European Union. That would mean strengthened
military relations on both a multilateral and a bilateral basis.
Mr Major, who had a long discussion with Mr Vaclav Klaus, the federal
finance minister, on Czechoslovakia's extensive privatisation programme, was
drawn into the country's intense general election campaign when he was asked
to comment on the possible secession of Slovakia from the Czech lands.
Without offering a direct judgment, on the implications of such a split for
relations with the west, he made clear that a divided Czechoslovakia would
find it harder to meet the conditions for EC entry.

inevitable by breaking ranks

<TEXT>
THE 50-year-old Russian officer in the Central Asian garrison wept on
hearing the news. But, however painful the decision, President Boris Yeltsin
was bowing to the inevitable when he ordered the creation of a Russian army
earlier this month.
After the Soviet Union's collapse in December, Mr Yeltsin and a handful of
other republic leaders had good political and economic reasons to try to
preserve the Red Army as a united force for the Commonwealth of Independent
States. Reality - including Ukraine's moves to build its own army - obliged
the Commonwealth's biggest republic to abandon the idea. 'Yeltsin simply did
what was necessary to terminate the anomaly of an army without a state,'
explained one western military attache.
That decision was cemented on Tuesday when most of the CIS defence ministers
agreed to dissolve their joint command over all but strategic nuclear
weapons, opening the way for the navy and air force, too, to be divided
among the states.
But as men who have spent most of their lives serving the Soviet Union come
to terms with the idea of serving a new, Russian, homeland, politicians and
commanders face a mountain of problems in transforming the world's largest
conscript army into one or more national armies.
Moscow must engage in tough negotiations with the outlying republics on who
gets what men and equipment and the conditions on which troops financed by
it will remain outside Russia, either to defend borders, or until they can
be brought home.
'They can't simply abandon troops outside Russia. They've got enough armed
orphans running around the country as it is,' said the military attache.
President Yeltsin has promised to bring troops back quickly from republics
where they risk being sucked into local wars. Yesterday he ordered the
recall of the 14th army from Moldova.
But it is likely that virtually all republics will negotiate to keep some
Russian troops on their territory. This the defiant Baltic republics, which
are pressing for an instant withdrawal of the Red Army but will need outside
troops to man the radars which are part of the former Soviet Union's early
warning systems against US long-range nuclear missiles.
The hardline leaders of Central Asian republics will push for their own
armies for the first time - having drawn their own conclusions from the
failure of Tajik President Rahmon Nabiyev to convince CIS troops to mow down
the political opponents who seized control of his government only a few
weeks ago. But they, too, will probably retain some Russian assistance for
defending strategic borders with countries such as Afghanistan.
For all the political hazards, the main challenge will be coping with
officers' plunging livproblem is not so much preventing a military coup but
ensuring discipline and incentives for men to obey orders under whatever
government they find themselves.
Draft-evasion has reached epic proportions; only 30 per cent of recruits are
expected to show up this spring. Officers' main complaints are about housing
shortages, and difficulties of making ends meet.
'Do you have majors in the west who are beggars?' asked one officer, who,
after 14 years of service, lives in a single room with his wife and two
teenage children, and shares a bathroom and kitchen with two other families.
In a typical struggle for survival, he moonlights to supplement a monthly
salary of Rbs3,400 and is indignant that bus drivers earn twice as much. His
savings of Rbs6,000 have been made worthless by market reforms which began
with price liberalisation this month.
The pain will only get worse with plans for sharp cuts in personnel as part
of the government's aim of creating a semi-professional force of 1.5m men by
the year 2000, down from the 2.63m currently included in the fledgling
Russian army. The pressures are already clear: the target for 1.5m men was
pushed back by four years just days after it was announced for 1996.
The aim is to move away from the entrenched Russian tradition of having a
professional officer corps side-by-side with low paid and humiliated
'serf-conscripts'.
But the creation of a professional army, put by General Pavel Grachev, the
defence minister, at Rbs1.5 trillion (million million) will cost even more
money to maintain than the present system and is unlikely to go smoothly or
easily. 'One wants to believe in all this, but it is difficult,' said the
officer. 'They have promised us so much already.'
Competing for resources will be plans to switch Russia's heavily militarised
economy into one capable of turning out both more civilian goods and better
weapons.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Sanctions may raise Milosevic support
</HEADLINE>

INTERNATIONAL sanctions against Serbia could increase popular support for
President Slobodan Milosevic by providing a scapegoat for the collapse of
the economy, according to diplomats in the Serbian capital.
In addition, sanctions may not stop the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina, at
least in the short term, because Serbia, under President Milosevic, has
financed the army by printing dinars. An oil embargo would compound already
acute fuel shortages in the civilian economy, but limited domestic
production is probably sufficient to meet the army's current needs.
An arms embargo has been in effect since last May. It has affected a
once-thriving arms industry, but the Serbian-dominated Yugoslav Federal Army
does not appear to be suffering any major shortages of weapons or
ammunition.
Diplomats say sanctions would have a mixed effect on Serbia's 9.8m people.
Exports to the European Community in the first quarter totalled some Dollars
700m (Pounds 395m), which represents a 35 per cent decline compared to the
same period in 1991. One diplomat said: 'It would obviously hurt Serbia to
cut off this source of hard currency. But it is basically self-sufficient in
terms of food and electricity production' because of abundant hydro-power.
However, sanctions would exacerbate the slump in Serbian industrial
production. Industrial output in the first quarter of the year fell by about
20 per cent compared with the same period last year. Mr Dimitrije Boarov, a
journalist of Vreme, a Belgrade weekly, says the metal industry has already
been hit hard by a shortage of spare parts and raw materials. The export of
electricity would also be hit by a blockade.
Comprehensive sanctions would also be aimed at Serbia's overseas assets.
Diplomats estimate that the National Bank of Yugoslavia has Dollars
1.8bn-Dollars 2.2bn in overseas assets, while Dollars 3.3bn-Dollars 5bn in
private assets are held in various offshore banking centres. But as one
diplomat noted yesterday: 'By the time they freeze the assets, the assets
would have fled.' An oil embargo would require a decision from the United
Nations. Serbia imports some 4m tonnes of oil, mostly from Iran and China,
and produces 1.05m tonnes per year. Mr Boarov yesterday dismissed Serbian
claims that it receives 22 per cent of its oil needs from Russia.
Despite petrol queues, Mr Boarov said the government had not introduced
rationing.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Yeltsin pledge to pull troops out of Moldova

<TEXT>
MOLDOVA and Russia yesterday both made 11th hour efforts to pull away from
open war over Moldova's breakaway region of Trans Dnestr, write Chrystia
Freeland in Kishinev and John Lloyd in Moscow. President Boris Yeltsin
promised to withdraw the most likely casus belli, the Russian-controlled
14th Army, which on May 19 openly entered the battle on the side of the
separatists in the predominantly Slavic region.
'Don't worry, there won't be a war. We will pull back the 14th army to
Russian territory and will not permit Russia to be dragged into war,' Mr
Yeltsin said, according to the Interfax news agency, during a tour of the
remote Altai region of Russia. There was no Russian military confirmation.
The highly industrialised Trans Dnestr region declared independence in 1990
under the leadership of Communist hardliners.
The Moldovan parliament meanwhile sought to soothe the fears of Russian and
Ukrainian inhabitants of the Trans Dnestr that they might soon find
themselves living in a new Romanian province. It promised a law which would
require all changes in Moldova's national status to be confirmed by a
referendum.
The parliament had passed a resolution demanding the 'immediate and
unconditional withdrawal of the 14th Army' which it characterised as an
occupation force. But it rebuffed pressure from nationalists to declare
martial law and affirmed its desire to resolve the conflict through
political channels.
Nonetheless, Moldovan authorities were sceptical about Mr Yeltsin's reported
promise. There have been three ineffectual meetings between foreign
ministers from Moldova, Russia, Romania and Ukraine, and the Moldovans
believe the Russian Defence Ministry, rather than the Russian president or
Foreign Ministry, is egging on the 14th Army.
The avowals of goodwill on both sides are to be tested tomorrow when the
foreign and defence ministers of Moldova, Russia, Ukraine and Romania are
due to meet again in Kishinev. This is to be followed in the near future by
a summit of the presidents of Moldova, Ukraine and Russia.

FT  28 MAY 92 / Outlook for UK jobless bleak for two years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER and PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE OUTLOOK for Britain's unemployed looks bleak over the next two years
because growth will be too weak to stop the number of people out of work
climbing towards 3m.
Moreover, the latest Financial Times survey of forecasts of the UK economy
suggests inflation will stay stubbornly above the chancellor of the
exchequer's goal of 2 per cent in spite of below-trend growth and a rising
jobless total.
The FT has polled 22 groups of economists at universities, independent
think-tanks and City investment houses. The survey suggests the Treasury's
March prediction of a 1 per cent rise in gross domestic product this year
and 3 per cent in the first half of 1993 is slightly too optimistic.
Instead the average forecast for output growth is about 0.8 per cent this
year and 2.4 per cent in 1993 with unemployment likely to reach 2.9m by the
end of 1993.
Looking further ahead, the National Institute of Economic and Social
Research yesterday cast doubt on the Treasury's medium-term projections that
GDP will grow by 3.5 per cent a year over the fiscal years 1994-95 to
1996-97. In a separate report, it projected no significant drop in UK
unemployment below 2.7m before the end of the decade.
The National Institute lays much of the blame for future slow growth on
'excessive' real interest rates in Europe.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Creditors pierce the veil of
secrecy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York's creditors are gradually stripping away the secrecy which
was once the hallmark of the debt-burdened property developer, writes
Bernard Simon.
The Toronto-based company, whose Canadian operations were placed under court
protection two weeks ago, has made public for the first time the cash flows
of its Canadian properties.
The data is contained in a 26-page affidavit submitted in response to a
court order which was granted last week at the request of the creditors. The
company was also due to provide various groups of lenders with more detailed
information by late yesterday, including projections of future cash flows.
An Ontario judge will hear arguments tomorrow on several other issues
critical to the company's debt restructuring.
The highest priority will be lenders' concern with the 'co-mingling' of
O&amp;Y's businesses in the US, Britain and Canada. The US and UK operations
remain outside the court protection granted under Canada's Companies
Creditors Arrangements Act. Lenders to the Canadian properties want the
court to put safeguards in place to prevent the company channelling income
to the Canary Wharf project in London or to cash-strapped US assets.
The court is expected to clarify the mandate of Mr Bernard Wilson, the Price
Waterhouse partner who was named as 'information officer' to liaise between
O&amp;Y and its lenders. Mr Wilson, whose fees will be paid by O&amp;Y, said he
plans to make several proposals to the court to facilitate his job.
The court will also consider motions from some lenders asking for
non-recourse companies secured by specific O&amp;Y properties to be released
from the CCAA order. The lenders, which include several European funds, had
been confident the structure of the single-purpose companies would insulate
them from the parent's problems.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Canadian banks advance despite
O&amp;Y provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOTH Bank of Montreal and Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third and fourth
biggest banks respectively, lifted second-quarter earnings despite their
sizeable exposures to troubled property developer Olympia &amp; York.
BMO, which disclosed CDollars 318m (USDollars 267.2m) in loans to O&amp;Y,
boosted net earnings to CDollars 143.5m, or CDollars 1.07 a share, in the
three months to April 30, from CDollars 128.4m, or CDollars 1.01 a share, a
year earlier.
The improvement was due largely to a slower rise in expenses than revenues,
and to a substantial growth in lending volumes, especially to small and
mid-sized businesses. Total assets have jumped by almost 8 per cent in the
past year to CDollars 104.2bn.
BNS's earnings advanced to CDollars 171m, or 75 cents a share, from CDollars
163.3m, or 73 cents a share, a year earlier. The bank ascribed the rise to
wider margins as both domestic and foreign interest rates continued to
decline.
BNS has lifted its fiscal 1992 loan loss provisions by CDollars 200m, or 45
per cent, to reflect its exposure to O&amp;Y, totalling CDollars 630m, and to
other troubled borrowers. But this was exactly offset by a recovery in Third
World loans.
Its second-quarter provision of CDollars 110m is unchanged from the previous
three months. The provision in the second quarter of 1991 was CDollars 85m.
Non-performing loans, net of provisions, rose to CDollars 1.87bn on April 30
from CDollars 1.74bn three months earlier. The bank did not disclose how
much of this increase was accounted for by O&amp;Y loans.
BMO has classified its entire O&amp;Y portfolio as non-performing, but has left
its forecast for fiscal 1992 loan losses unchanged at CDollars 500m. The
bank said that its loans to O&amp;Y are secured by specific office buildings
which continue to generate cash flow, and by listed marketable securities.
It is not involved in Canary Wharf or in any of O&amp;Y's large syndicated
financings.
Although they are among O&amp;Y's biggest lenders, the Canadian banks are
generally well-equipped to absorb substantial losses. BMO reported that its
risk-weighted capital-to-assets ratio improved in the second quarter to 9.1
per cent from 8.5 per cent three months earlier. BNS's capital ratio has
edged up to 8.6 per cent from 8.5 per cent. Both banks still have a return
on equity well into double digits.
Four other Canadian banks will report second-quarter earnings over the next
week.
