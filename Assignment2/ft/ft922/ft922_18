FT  27 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Broker boosts for Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN MILLHAM, PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHARMACEUTICALS group Wellcome finished 10 ahead at 988p after being up 17
earlier. A number of securities houses weighed in with enthusiastic
heavyweight research ahead of the big share issue this summer by its parent,
Wellcome Trust.
BZW was the first to publish, with a 112-page document homing in on the
growth of existing products, new drugs, productive research and development,
management changes, financial strength and potential earnings growth. James
Capel, SG Warburg Securities and Robert Fleming, lead broker for the share
flotation, also published.
The shares were further boosted by a weekend press report suggesting that
clinical trials on its cancer treatment Campath were going well. But BZW
said that, although Campath offered exciting prospects for the treatment of
arthritis, it was still only in early stages of development.
Details on the size and price of Wellcome Trust's planned issue of much of
its 73.5 per cent stake in Wellcome are expected in late June.
C and W favoured
The surging Hang Seng index, combined with positive sentiment from some
London market quarters, lifted Cable and Wireless by 9 to 583p. Turnover was
an impressive 3.7m. C and W, which accrues around 60 per cent of its profits
from its majority holding in Hong Kong Telecom, has underperformed in recent
weeks as sector attention has focused on Vodafone and BT.
A number of brokers were reported yesterday as being positive. Mr Jim Ross
at Hoare Govett said: 'Telephone network stocks are again attracting
investor attention and we feel that C and W has been left behind and now
looks good value. We also expect good results from HK Telecom tomorrow.'
After last week's strength, profit-taking and the return of regulatory
worries knocked BT, the fully-paid shares tumbling 6 1/2 to 360p and the
partly-paid 5 to 139 1/2 p. Turnover came to 2.9m and 12.7m respectively.
Vodafone eased a penny to 388p.
Opec news lifts oils
Higher crude oil prices and improved recommendations on both sides of the
Atlantic prompted heavy buying of the oil majors, and specifically BP.
In the US, Salomon Brothers moved to a buy from a hold stance on BP. The
house was responding to the decision by Opec to freeze oil production,
rather than increase it as had been feared. In the UK, Societe Generale
Strauss Turnbull, which has taken a strong dislike to the stock for some
time, conceded that it would see 'a strong short-term rally'. However,
Strauss oils analyst Mr John Toalster said he was making no fundamental
change to his bearish attitude.
The Opec decision prompted an immediate rise in the price of Brent crude,
which topped Dollars 20 a barrel for the first time since the end of
November and contributed to higher prices for oil company shares. BP jumped
10 to 272p with 22m shares traded. It was also very strong in the US, with
1.1m American Depositary Receipts changing hands, the equivalent of more
than 13m shares, by the time London closed.
Meanwhile, Shell, considered the quality stock of the sector, climbed 13 to
520p on turnover of 4.7m shares.
Oil exploration company Lasmo was the strongest performer of the FT-SE 100
constituents, rising on higher crude oil prices and news that it expects to
receive Dollars 30m (Pounds 16.9m) more than previously hoped from the
public offering of Canadian and US assets acquired through its takeover bid
for Ultramar. Lasmo shares moved ahead 8 to 207p.
Also, Lasmo director Mr Norman Davidson Kelly announced that the company had
decided to get rid of its downstream assets from the Ultramar acquisition by
way of an initial public offering which was expected to be completed by the
end of June.
Weekend press reports that British Gas is carrying out a strategic review of
its operations which might lead to the company being split up boosted its
shares in pre-market trading. The stock opened 11 1/2 up and then drifted
back with the market to close 6 1/2 ahead at 257p as analysts spoke to the
company and decided that the story was based on City speculation.
Strauss Turnbull said the story reminded people that the share price
undervalued the company, but County NatWest advised clients to sell into
strength, arguing that Gas contained no 'significant hidden value'.
Exploration Company of Louisiana jumped 16 to 88p on further consideration
of an announcement at the end of last week about prospects for the East
Riceville field in South Louisiana. Mr Tony Alves of ExCo Louisiana's UK
broker Henderson Crosthwaite said initial tests suggested that the field
could add 100p a share to the company's present net asset value of 60p.
Take profits advice from a number of securities houses and worries about
increased oil/fuel prices saw British Airways fall 7 to 307p. One of the
houses, Kleinwort Benson, said all BA's recent good news was now in the
price and an 'uncertain economic background, increased competition and
continuing weak premium traffic' in the coming year meant little upside in
the price.
There was more trouble for Eurotunnel as the chairman of French contractor
Bouygues said talks to compensate the builders were deadlocked and added:
'We cannot rule out that Eurotunnel might go bankrupt.' The group's shares
were steady at 370p.
Mountleigh's demise failed to have a dramatic effect on the property sector,
the receivership having been widely expected in the market. Only Speyhawk, a
developer also in acute financial straits, retreated on reflection, dropping
4 to 9 1/2 p.
However, selected banks suffered on worries over their exposure to
Mountleigh. Barclays fell 9 to 383p, NatWest 7 to 354p and TSB 6 1/2 to
144p.
The worst kept secret in the leisure sector, that Forte is close to selling
its catering subsidiary Gardner Merchant, was still being denied by the
hotel group at its agm yesterday. However, analysts said the uncertainty was
affecting the shares, which declined 3 to 236p, with returning talk that
Forte will need a rights issue if it fails to make a disposal.
Dealers suspected a possible switch as leading supermarket chain Argyll
Group gained 3 to 349p while Tesco lost 4 to 263p in an otherwise thin
sector. Goldman Sachs was particularly keen on Argyll, in spite of market
disappointment at recent results, noting that its Safeway subsidiary is the
second most profitable food retailer in the UK.

FT  27 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Poor trade figures upset share prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A PROMISING start by London's equity market to the last period of the
three-week trading account was halted in its tracks by a disappointing set
of UK trade figures for April and a steep opening decline by Wall Street.
The trade figures were greeted with widespread dismay by marketmakers, who
quickly gave the leaders the red pencil treatment, chopping prices across
the board and prompting a hefty reversal in the FT-SE 100-share Index.
Up more than 12 points within two hours of the opening, the index moved into
negative ground soon after the economic data emerged, and remained under
pressure for the rest of a quiet session to close a net 10.4 off at the
day's low of 2,704.6.
Ironically, it was the oil and gas sector, among the market's poorest
performing areas for around 18 months, that helped prevent an even steeper
fall by the Footsie.
Last week's Opec agreement on output resulted in crude oil prices edging
back over the Dollars 20 a barrel mark yesterday and produced keen support
for the sector.
The day began on a subdued note, with the Footsie opening around seven
points higher, mainly due to the strength of the oil sector and a number of
individual stocks such as Cable and Wireless, Welcome and SmithKline
Beecham.
But with little genuine retail buying interest evident and the trade figures
coming in much worse than had been expected, the market turned off sharply
as a flurry of profit-taking and institutional selling appeared.
Dealers pointed out, however, that the market's attendance was well down on
normal levels, as many operators took advantage of the good bank holiday
weather with extended breaks. One estimated that perhaps as many as a
quarter of the usual number of fund managers had stayed away. 'The
marketmakers wanted the market down, got their excuse with the trade figures
and Wall Street and they got their way,' said one senior salesman.
The Footsie's poor performance was accompanied by equally poor turnover
figures for equities. Volume yesterday fell to 404.3m shares, the lowest
since the general election. Figures published by the Stock Exchange revealed
that the value of customer business last Friday totalled Pounds 937.8m. On
four out of the five trading sessions last week retail business fell below
the Pounds 1bn level.
With the volume of business showing distinct signs of shrinking and summer
looming, many market traders are beginning to question the likelihood of a
flurry of takeover activity and spate of rights issues widely forecast after
the Conservative election victory.
The oil sector provided the best individual Footsie performance in Lasmo,
which rose more than 4 per cent, closely followed by BP, British Gas and
Shell. The rises followed what Mr Steve Turner, energy specialist at Smith
New Court, described as 'the most unambiguously bullish Opec meeting since
July 1990, when Opec announced its intention to move to a Dollars 21 a
barrel market price'.
TSB took the dubious honour of being the worst Footsie performer, dropping
4.3 per cent.

FT  27 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow declines on higher oil
price prospect
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
THE prospect of higher oil prices, following a change in Saudi Arabia's
pricing policy, triggered fears of inflation and depressed US equity prices
yesterday, writes Karen Zagor in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average ended 22.56 lower at 3,364.21. Declines led
rises by about two-to-one after moderate New York SE volume of about 198m
shares. The Standard &amp; Poor's 500 slipped 2.61 to 411.41, while the Nasdaq
composite lost 4.65 to 575.65.
The pressure on prices started early in the day, following reports in the
Wall Street Journal that Saudi Arabia had apparently changed its pricing
policy and that crude oil prices might rise by as much as Dollars 3 a barrel
later in the year, spurring fears that higher prices might lead to an
escalation in inflation. In late trading, the July crude oil contract on the
New York Mercantile Exchange was quoted Dollars 1.06 higher at Dollars 22 a
barrel.
In addition, sentiment was dampened by an unexpectedly sharp rise in the May
consumer confidence index, which further quelled hopes of an immediate
interest rate cut. The May index weighed in at 71.6, above the 68 the market
had expected.
Energy issues dominated big board trading, with some attaining 52-week
highs. The activity was spurred by reports that Saudi Arabia, the world's
largest oil exporter, had changed its pricing policy and planned to bring it
in line with the Opec producers who want higher prices. Since the end of the
Gulf war, the sector has suffered because of weak oil and natural gas
prices.
Exxon forged ahead Dollars 3 1/2 to Dollars 64, USX-Marathon Dollars 1 5/8
to Dollars 23 7/8 , Mobil Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 67 and British
Petroleum's ADRs Dollars 2 5/8 to Dollars 60 5/8 .
Oil service shares also benefited from the prospect of increased crude
prices. Halliburton rose Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 29 7/8 , Baker Hughes
Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 23 3/4 and Schlumberger Dollars 3 5/8 to Dollars 68
1/2 .
The boost for crude oil prices was a blow to the transportation section, the
Dow Jones Transportation Average tumbling 15.69 to 1,360.80. AMR, parent of
American Airlines, declined Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 64 3/8 , Delta Air
Lines Dollars 1 1/2 to Dollars 57 7/8 and United Airlines Dollars 3 1/4 to
Dollars 118 3/4 .
Merck receded Dollars 1 3/8 to Dollars 49 1/2 . The company recently
implemented a three-for-one stock split. It has declared a regular 23-cent
quarterly dividend on the split shares.
General Motors and Ford lost Dollars 1 1/4 to Dollars 38 and Dollars 7/8 to
Dollars 43 1/4 respectively. GM reported mid-May US car sales of 94,323, up
from 82,312 a year earlier. US truck sales rose to 51,790 from 43,233.
Ford's mid-May car and truck sales also improved from the previous year.
Canada
TORONTO gained ground yesterday and closed at the day's best after oil
futures shot higher on Opec's decision to freeze output at second quarter
levels. Gold shares climbed on expectations that strengthening crude oil
prices will spur inflation.
The TSE 300 composite index rose 12 points to 3,382.3 and advances outscored
declines by 308 to 263 after volume of 25.1m shares valued at CDollars
271.7m.
Imperial Oil led the energy group, rising CDollars 2 1/8 to CDollars 44 3/8
on volume of 196,000 shares as the sector's index climbed 2.2 per cent.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Confidence figures boost dollar
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
EVIDENCE from the US that consumers grew more confident about the economy in
May boosted the dollar.
The US currency perked up during European trading after news that the
Conference Board's consumer confidence index rose to 71.6 in May from a
revised 65.1 for April.
Mr Neil MacKinnon, chief economist at Yamaichi Bank, said: 'The consumer
confidence figures were extremely good news for the dollar. The very strong
pick-up suggests that consumers are getting ready to spend again.'
By mid-afternoon the dollar had recovered early losses to stand at DM1.6115,
from DM1.6060 just before the confidence data were released. It rallied to
Y129.33 from a Y128.75 low and a Y129.25 start. But in later trading it lost
ground to end at DM1.6090, nearly a pfennig down from Friday's DM1.6185
close. The dollar firmed in New York to close at DM1.6127 and Y129.50.
Although the confidence data were welcome news for the dollar, analysts
warned that it would not be sufficient to enable the currency to break out
of its DM1.6050 to DM1.6250 range. Other US economic statistics yesterday
were less encouraging - existing home sales fell by 0.3 per cent in April
compared with March - and the wide interest rate differential between the
dollar and the D-Mark continues to obstruct the US currency's progress.
Meanwhile, sterling was unmoved by news that the UK's current account
deficit almost doubled last month. The sharp deterioration in the figures
for April were ignored by the foreign exchange markets, traders said.
Mr Peter Luxton, senior economist at Barclays, commented: 'There was
absolutely no interest. Sterling held absolutely rock steady when the news
came out.' There were suggestions that the pound would test its central EMS
rate of DM2.95 this week.
According to traders, the steadiness of the UK currency - which finished the
day at DM2.9425 - stemmed partly from positive long-term prospects for
sterling, notably the dwindling possibility of another base rate cut on the
horizon, and partly from the fact that the big rise in imports was
concentrated in areas such as capital and consumer goods which suggested a
recovery in confidence.
The French franc also nudged higher, improving to FFr3.3602 per D-Mark from
FFr3.3620. Traders said the French currency was underpinned by a comment
from Mr Michel Sapin, the French finance minister, that he would not lower
interest rates except as part of a co-ordinated move with other countries.
This positive sentiment was reinforced by news that France's economy grew by
1.1 per cent in the first quarter compared with the previous quarter.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates creep higher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEWS that the UK current account deficit deteriorated sharply in April sent
a shiver through the money markets.
Rates firmed after figures from the Central Statistical Office showed that
the current account deficit widened to Pounds 1.06bn in April, significantly
higher than the City's consensus forecast of Pounds 600m.
The deficit - the result of a surge in imports and dwindling exports -
followed the previous month's deficit of Pounds 591m.
While the foreign exchange markets were unruffled by the ballooning trade
gap, the money markets - described by one trader as 'a beacon of sanity' -
reacted adversely.
The key three-month interbank rate rose  1/8 percentage point to 10 1/16 per
cent, while the rate for six-month money firmed to 10 per cent from a close
of 9 15/16 per cent on Friday.
The September sterling contract fell by eight basis points during the day.
It opened at 90.37, but touched a low of 90.28, where it hovered in late
trading.
The downward movement in sterling futures suggests that the market is less
sure of a base rate cut before September. Today's levels still allow for a
1/4 point cut in base rates, but according to Mr Nick Parsons of the
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, a drop below 90.25 would mean that the
market had given up any hope of a base rate reduction before the autumn.
Short-term cash rates came under heavy pressure during the day because of a
log-jam in the market, which meant it failed to meet the Bank of England's
big shortage.
In the morning the Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.7bn but provided
only limited liquidity in the early rounds of its operations. The forecast
was later revised to around Pounds 1.6bn and morning assistance came to
Pounds 791m, including Pounds 124m of band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent.
The shortage was later revised upwards to Pounds 1.8bn. The Bank operated
again, purchasing Pounds 705m of bills, including Pounds 670m of band-1
bills at 9 7/8 per cent and Pounds 35m of band-2 bills at the same rate.
Late assistance of Pounds 125m brought overall intervention operations to
Pounds 1.6bn.
As a result overnight rates soared to 22 per cent, where they finished the
day.
German call money firmed slightly yesterday to 9.50/60 per cent from 9.45/55
per cent. Dealers expect the Bundesbank to hold rates stable.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Algeria to sign exploration
deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON, Middle East Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALGERIA IS on the verge of signing a fresh batch of oil and gas exploration
agreements, according Mr Nordine Ait Laoussine, the oil minister, who said
the government is discussing new ventures with six foreign companies.
Speaking after last week's Opec meeting, Mr Ait Laoussine said: 'We will be
able to announce very shortly several exploration agreements'.
The oil minister said Algeria's ambitious oil and gas expansion plans,
accelerated late last year by law changes to encourage foreign investment,
could entail investment worth Dollars 20bn by the end of the century in a
drive to boost output to meet European demand.
Mr Ait Laoussine also said Algeria would open a bidding process for up to 12
new oil concessions in July. He added that, if should talks with some of the
six companies currently involved in negotiations - including US, European
and Japanese groups - were not be concluded by then, he might include blocs
in the next round.
He hoped to offer fresh territory for bidding every six months. 'We would
like to cover all the sedimentary areas with bidders,' he said.
The country - which is also a leading producer of gas, liquified natural gas
and condensates - hopes to raise output from some 1.8m b/d of oil equivalent
to some 2.5m b/d by the turn of the century. Mr Ait Laoussine said Algeria
had signed contracts to export almost 60bn cubic metres of natural gas a
year - the most the country can comfortably sustain, he explained - and was
expanding facilities to meet that target.
With reserves of 3 trillion (million million) cu m of gas, the minister said
recently that Algeria hoped to become Europe's major gas supplier over the
next decade. In Vienna he pointed out that Algeria needed to explore gas
fields in the country's south which, he said, had been largely neglected.
On oil, Mr Ait Laoussine said there was a 'definite need to increase the
exploration effort' in Algeria, which at present pumps 770,000 barrels a
day.
Official studies estimate that Algeria faces a decline in sustainable output
to between 500,000 and 300,000 b/d by early next century without new oil
finds. Algeria presently has just over 9bn barrels of exploitable reserves.
The government late last year substantially revised its foreign investment
laws in the hope of attracting foreign capital into its hitherto protected
oil sector. The changes permitted output sharing agreements, improved
exploration terms and cut tax and royalty rates.
Atlantic Richfield (Arco) this month became the first foreign company since
the law changes to sign contracts with Sonatrach, the state oil company, to
explore for oil and gas.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Brent oil price breaks through
Dollars 20 barrier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORTH SEA oil prices broke through the Dollars 20-a-barrel barrier to reach
a six-month high following the unexpected agreement by the Organisation of
Petroleum Exporting Countries in Vienna last week to roll over its
second-quarter output ceiling.
Saudi Arabia had widely signalled its intention before the meeting to press
for a rise of 1m barrels a day. In the event it agreed to maintain the
existing ceiling of 22.98m b/d.
Brent crude for July delivery rose 90 cents to Dollars 20.45, the highest
price since December last year.
'The market has been very firm, on the conclusion that last week's agreement
marks a fundamental shift in Saudi oil policy,' said Mr Peter Gignoux, head
of Smith Barney's energy desk in London. 'It looks as if there is further
pent-up demand, and we could see it reaching Dollars 21 in the short-term.'
He warned, however, that it might be premature to talk of a 'fundamental'
shift in Saudi policy, or of longer-term increases of Dollars 2 or Dollars 3
in the Brent price.
Mr Mehdi Varzi, oil analyst at Kleinwort Benson, believed that the agreement
'epitomised Saudi Arabia's willingness to move into line with the Opec
majority' and treat Dollars 21 a barrel for the Opec basket of crudes as a
real target. That would mean a Brent crude price of around Dollars 23.
Analysts point out that Saudi Arabia may indirectly have achieved as much as
it wanted without needing to raise the ceiling.
The agreement allowed for an increase of 300,000 b/d in Kuwaiti production,
while Saudi Arabia said it would continue to produce slightly more oil than
it was officially allocated.
Most estimates put Opec's true second-quarter output at about 23.5m b/d,
likely to rise to 24m b/d by the end of the third quarter. That would
effectively be in line with both Saudi wishes and the lower end of
expectations of third-quarter demand.
However, stock-building before the winter is likely to boost third-quarter
demand by at least 500,000 b/d and keep prices firm.
Beyond that, observers feel that Saudi Arabia's actions may be explained by
short-term political factors - such as a desire to avoid another clash with
Iran.
The kingdom may also have decided to flex its political muscles and
demonstrate the control it - and Opec - can still exert on oil prices before
next month's Earth Summit in Rio. Opec is firmly opposed to EC proposals for
a carbon tax which it believes would badly hurt its revenues.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: Jump in consumer confidence index upsets
Treasuries

LONGER-DATED US Treasuries tumbled yesterday in response to reports that
crude oil prices might climb as much as Dollars 3-a-barrel this year. The
market was also shaken by signs of an improving economic climate from a
surprisingly large increase in the May consumer confidence survey.
In late trading, the Treasury's bellwether 30-year bond was down  15/16 at
101, yielding 7.906 per cent. Shorter-dated maturities fared better, with
the two-year note losing a more moderate  5/32 to yield 5.326 per cent.
The Federal Reserve entered the open market to arrange two-day system
repurchase agreements when Fed Funds were trading at 3 15/16 per cent. The
adding operation was widely expected and was seen as a technical move to
meet requirements.
Traders started liquidating positions in longer-dated bonds late last week,
on reports that Federal Reserve policy-makers had decided not to take
immediate steps to cut short-term interest rates.
The selling accelerated yesterday following the release of the consumer
confidence index for May, which rose to 71.6 per cent from a revised 65.1
per cent in April. Players had been looking for a May reading of around 68
per cent. The April index was previously reported as 64.8 per cent.
FRENCH government bonds fell by over a quarter of a percentage point
yesterday as Mr Michel Sapin, the finance minister, dashed hopes of a cut in
interest rates.
Mr Sapin suggested that a cut in French interest rates would have to be part
of a co-ordinated move. The comments were taken to mean that France would
not act unless the Bundesbank cuts German interest rates - a scenario which
few traders expect to see in the short term.
A strong first quarter GDP figure, showing growth of 1.1 per cent, also
reinforced the view that France is unlikely to cut rates soon, traders said.
The yield on the 10-year benchmark bond - the 8 1/2 per cent bond due 2002 -
moved from the opening level of 8.49 per cent to 8.56 per cent by late
afternoon. The Matif futures contract fell from 108.88 to 108.56.
Elsewhere in Europe, the government bond markets drifted lower in dull
trading. German bond futures fell from the opening of 87.89 to end at around
87.73, wiping out early gains.
Bunds rose briefly early in the day, following the release of
better-than-expected inflation data for the western German state of Hesse.
Consumer prices in Hesse rose 0.3 per cent in the month to mid-May, and by
4.1 per cent on the previous year.
THE UK government bond market dropped due to the combination of
disappointing trade figures and worries about supply.
A worse-than-expected current account deficit in April of Pounds 1.06bn,
compared with Pounds 591m in March, pushed down gilt prices, with
longer-dated issues falling between a quarter and a half of a percentage
point. The benchmark 11 3/4 per cent gilt due 2003/07 fell from 118 17/32 to
118 1/16 .
JAPANESE government bonds slipped in late trading, following the initial
fall in US Treasury bonds and ahead of the monthly government bond auction.
The Ministry of Finance is expected to auction about Y800bn of 10-year
bonds, probably today. Traders said the June issue was expected to carry a
slightly lower coupon of 5.6 per cent, compared with 5.7 per cent in last
month's auction. 'A 5.6 per cent coupon isn't exactly bad news, but it might
dampen retail interest,' said one dealer.
The yield on the benchmark government bond - the No 129 - opened at 5.495
per cent and closed in Tokyo at 5.515 per cent. However, it then moved to
5.54 per cent in London, trading as the US Treasury bond market fell.
Traders report a shift out of short-dated bonds into the long end of the
market recently, and expect this trend to continue over the next couple of
days.
News that the long-term prime rate would be raised by 0.3 percentage points
to 6.3 per cent, with effect from June 1, had little impact on the bond
market, dealers said. The key September futures ended at 101.68, down from
101.80 on Monday, on a volume of 29,382 contracts.

dividend

<TEXT>
THE BANK of New Zealand yesterday reported a 30 per cent improvement in net
operating profit to NZDollars 171.1m (USDollars 92m) for the year ended
March 1992 and increased its dividend from three to four cents a share.
But company officials declined to comment on speculation that the bank would
soon have new owners.
Mr Syd Pasley, chairman, told a news conference it was inappropriate for him
to comment on the prospects of a sale.
BNZ's share price has risen by 22 per cent in the past month, partly on
expectations of improved profits, but mostly on rumours that the government
was about to sell its 58.2 per cent stake in BNZ.
The NZ government attempted to sell the bank in 1987, but pulled out of the
market because bids were too low. Since then the state has twice had to
inject capital to rescue the bank.
Mr Pasley said the bank had been successfully reshaped during the past three
years. Last year's profit equated with 21.1 per cent on ordinary
shareholders' funds.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Oil groups may form mutual
insurer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SEDGWICK, the UK insurance broker, and Price Waterhouse, the accountants and
management consultants, are joining forces in a bid to help leading European
oil and gas companies form a new mutual insurance company.
The new mutual, which could have a capital base of more than Dollars 50m and
a minimum of 15 members, would provide extra insurance capacity in the
specialist energy insurance market, where rates have increased and capacity
diminished following recent losses.
Since December, Sedgwick and Price Waterhouse have conducted feasibility
studies and intend to hold more detailed talks with their clients within the
next two weeks. No company has yet agreed to join the proposed mutual, but
both organisations report a general feeling of support from their clients
for the concept.
'We believe the support is there. We are literally having clients say to us
'when can we have it?',' said Mr Chris Mundy, director of marketing at
Sedgwick Energy, the broker's specialist subsidiary.
'We would like to think we would be putting together a cast iron proposal
within the next four to six weeks,' he added. Mr Mundy said there was an
urgent need for action because of the contraction in available capacity.
Sedgwick's 200 clients include British Petroleum, Shell and Mobil.
Several oil majors which have North American interests are already part of a
mutual company, Oil Insurance Ltd (OIL), which was formed in the late 1960s.
Hit by losses such as the explosion of the Piper Alpha rig in the North Sea
in July 1988, specialist energy insurers, including syndicates at Lloyd's of
London, have increased rates and reduced the amount of cover available.
Last year, buyers faced rate increases of between 15 and 200 per cent.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Fletcher Challenge to dip
into loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   WELLINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FLETCHER CHALLENGE is to write down its Australian and New Zealand property
portfolio by NZDollars 400m (USDollars 215m) in a move that will force an
unexpected loss on the company for this year.
It says that the write down, intended to comply with international
accounting practices, will push the company into a loss of about NZDollars
155m for the year ending June 1992, instead of a predicted NZDollars 300m
profit.
The news stunned the New Zealand stock market. Analysts had been braced for
a write-down at the company's 48 per cent owned Australian property arm,
Jennings.
However, analysts had not expected write downs on the company's other
property involvements.
Mr Hugh Fletcher, chief executive, said the write-down did not represent
cash outflows, and would not affect the group's ability to pay a prudent
dividend. The board expects to pay a total dividend of 14 cents, compared
with 27 cents in 1990-91.
Included in the write-down is some NZDollars 50m as a result of the decision
by the Jennings group to write off ADollars 74m (USDollars 56.92m) of its
involvement in the ADollars 650m Southgate development in Melbourne.
Fletcher Challenge said this provoked it to write off NZDollars 350m from
its other property investments. That represents 29 cents a share, or eight
per cent of net asset backing.
The group forecast an end-June asset backing of NZDollars 4.13 per share.
Year-end assets per share will now be NZDollars 3.70, broadly in line with
the NZDollars 3.68 of end 1990-91.
A main reason for the heavy write-down was a wish to conform with US
accounting practices as far as New Zealand accounting standards and law
would allow.
Mr Fletcher said that the increasing overseas ownership in the company,
which now stands at 40 per cent and the overseas origin of debt, were
related factors.
He said the write-down would allow investors to focus on the group's
competitive strength and the potential for recovery in its four businesses
of pulp and paper, energy, building and rural servicing 'secure in the
knowledge that adequate provision had been made for the group's property
exposures.'
Mr Fletcher said that the company still expected to sell NZDollars 750m
worth of assets this year.
There were no plans for future cash issues. Next year's results were
expected to benefit from improvements in most markets, he said.

reduces borrowings
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TNT, the international transport group, has remained in the red for the
third quarter of 1991-92 but has significantly reduced its borrowings.
The company yesterday announced a loss of ADollars 44.4m (USDollars 33.6m)
for the nine months ended March, against a half-year loss of ADollars 23.4m
and a loss of Dollars A18.5m in the previous corresponding period.
But the company said earnings continued to be heavily affected by abnormal
items, most latterly associated with the flotation of the GD Express
Worldwide venture in the US which raised about ADollars 400m.
Abnormals added a ADollars 40.9m loss in the latest nine months, compared
with ADollars 48.2m previously. Before abnormals and tax there was a profit
of ADollars 23.2m, against ADollars 55m.
Helped by the GD Express sale, TNT more than halved its interest bill in the
period to ADollars 41.7m. Borrowings had been reduced by ADollars 898.5m.
Despite the recession, the group increased revenue in Italy, GD Express
Worldwide, domestic operations in Germany and Spain, the European contract
logistics business and the TNT shipping and development group, the company
said.
Revenue was steady in the UK and the US, while declines were experienced in
Australia, Canada and Brazil. TNT said the company's half-owned domestic
airline operations, Ansett and Eastwest, had incurred losses in the period.
'While there is no question as to the underlying worth of TNT's investment
in Ansett, it is possible that Ansett may reassess, at year-end, the value
of its investment in Eastwest in the light of the current confused airline
policy situation,' TNT said.

offering

<TEXT>
SAPPI, the South African pulp and paper company, plans to raise about
Dollars 250m through share issues on the London, Paris and Frankfurt stock
markets. The offer, the largest by a South African company since trade and
investment sanctions were lifted, will go ahead in June.
Gencor, one of South Africa's largest conglomerates and owner of a
controlling interest in Sappi, will underwrite the issue for up to the South
African rand equivalent of Dollars 115m.
The offer will be partly used to finance Sappi's DM396.5m (Dollars 240.30m)
acquisition of 90 per cent of Hannover Papier, a German fine paper group.
Hannover had existing obligations of DM370m at the end of last year.
The acquisition is part of Sappi's strategy of reducing its dependency on
the South African market, Mr Eugene Van As, executive chairman, said.
The group wants to move increasingly into European high-margin specialty
papers, but this would be impossible without closer links to customers, he
says.
Sappi expects about half the shares to be taken up in South Africa and half
in Europe. US investors may be put off by the continuing sanctions imposed
by 13 states and 74 municipalities. The consequent losses in those markets
may be greater than potential gains of doing business with South Africa.
The issue is being lead-managed by SG Warburg.

<TEXT>
JAPANESE non-life insurance companies were hit by sharp increases in
underwriting losses stemming from last September's typhoon damages and
declining investment income.
Non-consolidated net premium income for the year ended March at the top five
Japanese non-life insurers - Tokio Marine &amp; Fire, Yasuda Fire &amp; Marine,
Mitsui Marine &amp; Fire, Sumitomo Marine &amp; Fire, and Nippon Fire &amp; Marine -
rose 6.8 per cent as a result of brisk sales of car and compulsory auto
liability insurances.
But all five companies reported falls in pre-tax and after-tax profits. Only
Tokio posted an operating profit. Net insurance payments for the five
companies jumped 27.7 per cent to Y1,857.3bn (Dollars 14.35bn), due to a
rise in car accidents and the surge in claims from typhoon damages.
Non-operating profits were squeezed due to lower interest rates and the
stock market slump.
The companies also faced a sharp rise in redemptions for the savings type
insurances.

<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Materials, a leading Japanese maker of metals and ceramics,
posted a 25.7 per cent decline in pre-tax profits to Y20.3bn (Dollars 156m)
for the year to end-March. Net profits also plunged, by 20.2 per cent, to
Y32.8bn on a special gain related to land sales.
Weak sales of gold and declines in demand and prices for other metals amid
the domestic economic sluggishness were behind the poor profit performance.
In contrast, aluminium can sales posted gains due to increasing
environmental concerns.
The company, which changed its name from Mitsubishi Metal after merging with
Mitsubishi Mining and Cement in December 1990, posted a 3.5 per cent sales
gain for the year to Y787.8bn.
However, in the period ending in March 1991 cement sales relating to a
subsidiary involved in the merger contributed for only four months.
Calculated at the same rate over the entire period comparable turnover for
the year just ended was off Y113bn, Mitsubishi Materials said.
For the current term, Mitsubishi Materials expects a partial recovery in
metals demand as well as continued gains in its aluminium can operations.
Sales are forecast to gain 4 per cent to Y820bn and pre-tax profits 3 per
cent to Y21bn. However, in the absence of further land sales net profits are
seen falling 69 per cent to Y10bn.

KDD, Japan's international telecommunications company, said a rise in
revenues from its international telephone service helped boost sales in the
year to March, but profits were affected by losses on its securities
holdings.
Non-consolidated sales for the year grew 1.6 per cent to Y244.5bn (Dollars
1.89bn), while non-operating profits increased by 14.2 per cent to Y19.4bn.
However, pre-tax profits rose by just 0.2 per cent to Y26bn. Lower corporate
taxes lifted after-tax profits by 4.6 per cent to Y14.1bn.
KDD, which posted sharp declines in sales and profits in the previous year
due to competition in the international telecommunication business and lower
rates, said cost controls helped operating profits.
The company recorded Y2.7bn in losses on securities holdings due to the
decline in the Tokyo market. Interest received fell 32.5 per cent to Y2.8bn,
while interest on securities declined 53.3 per cent to Y865m. Dividends
received fell 37.8 per cent to Y293m.
Legislative changes to allow foreign ownership of KDD shares - now
prohibited - are under way, and KDD said foreign investors would be able to
buy its shares during this fiscal year.
For the current year to March 1993, KDD expects a 3.7 per cent rise in
pre-tax profits to Y27bn on a 5.9 per cent increase in sales to Y259bn.

THE US machine tools industry suffered a 9.4 per cent decline in orders in
April, compared with the month before, but the level of orders still showed
a recovery against the depressed orders of a year ago, writes Alan Friedman
in New York.
Orders for the industry were Dollars 220m in April, down from Dollars 243m
in March, according to the Association for Manufacturing Technology, a US
machine tool trade organisation. But the orders were 13.6 per cent higher
than the Dollars 193.7m achieved in April 1991.
The industry's main problem is garnering export orders. Export orders were
37.6 per cent lower in April than in the same month last year, while
domestic orders rose by 29.7 per cent year-on-year.

   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK of Montreal (BMO) and Bank of Nova Scotia, Canada's third and fourth
biggest banks respectively, lifted second-quarter earnings despite their
sizeable exposures to troubled property developer Olympia &amp; York.
BMO, which disclosed CDollars 318m (USDollars 267.2m) in loans to O&amp;Y,
boosted net earnings to CDollars 143.5m, or CDollars 1.07 a share, in the
three months to April 30, from CDollars 128.4m, or CDollars 1.01, a year
earlier.
The improvement was due largely to a slower rise in expenses than in
revenues, and to a substantial growth in lending volumes, especially to
small and mid-sized businesses. Total assets have jumped by almost 8 per
cent in the past year to CDollars 104.2bn.
BNS's earnings advanced to CDollars 171m, or 75 cents a share, from CDollars
163.3m, or 73 cents, in the same period last year. The bank ascribed the
rise to wider margins as interest rates continued to decline.
BNS has lifted its fiscal 1992 loan loss provisions by CDollars 200m, or 45
per cent, to reflect its exposure to O&amp;Y and to other troubled borrowers.
Its exposure to O&amp;Y stands at CDollars 630m.
Its second-quarter provision of CDollars 110m is unchanged from the previous
three months. The provision in the second quarter of 1991 was CDollars 85m.
Non-performing loans, net of provisions, rose to CDollars 1.87bn on April 30
from CDollars 1.74bn three months earlier. The bank did not disclose how
much of this increase was accounted for by O&amp;Y loans.
BMO has classified its entire O&amp;Y portfolio as non-performing, but has left
its forecast for fiscal 1992 loan losses unchanged at CDollars 500m. The
bank said that its loans to O&amp;Y were secured by specific office buildings,
which continue to generate cash flow, and by listed marketable securities.
It is not involved in the Canary Wharf project in London or in any of O&amp;Y's
large syndicated financings.
Although they are among O&amp;Y's biggest lenders, the Canadian banks are
generally well-equipped to absorb substantial losses. BMO reported that its
risk-weighted capital-to-assets ratio improved in the second quarter to 9.1
per cent from 8.5 per cent three months earlier. BNS's capital ratio has
edged up to 8.6 per cent from 8.5 per cent. Olympia &amp; York's creditors are
gradually stripping away the secrecy that was once the property developer's
hallmark.
The Toronto-based company, whose Canadian operations were placed under court
protection two weeks ago, has made public for the first time the cash flows
of its Canadian properties.
The data is contained in a 26-page affidavit submitted in response to a
court order which was granted last week at the request of the creditors. The
company was also due to provide various groups of lenders with more detailed
information by late yesterday, including projections of future cash flows.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Revlon to sell 20m shares in
move to pay down debts

REVLON, the US cosmetics and consumer products company taken over by Mr
Ronald Perelman, the corporate raider, after a bruising bid battle in 1985,
is coming back to the stock market.
The New York-based company announced yesterday that it planned to transfer
its cosmetics, skin care, fragrance and personal care operations to a new
subsidiary company, 'New Revlon'. It will then sell 20m shares in this
subsidiary to investors, via an initial public offering.
Shares sold to investors via the flotation will account for just under
one-fifth of New Revlon's equity. Revlon Inc, the parent company, will own
the remaining 82.2 per cent, and will continue to be controlled by Mr
Perelman.
Revlon said that funds raised via the flotation would go towards paying down
debts, Revlon said that the maximum offering price in the IPO filing was
Dollars 19 a share, which would raise Dollars 380m before expenses.
Yesterday, Moody's, the Wall Street rating agency, said it had placed
Revlon's existing publicly-traded debt securities under review for a
possible upgrade.
Moody's said it was 'focusing on the extent proceeds from the new equity
issue will be used to reduce debt levels, the resulting financial
flexibility at Revlon and the ability of the remaining Revlon businesses to
generate cash to service debt going forward in a very competitive operating
environment'.
Revlon was founded in 1932 by the eccentric Mr Charles Revson. The Dollars
1.8bn takeover by Mr Perelman was a quintessential 1980s deal, heavily
dependent on junk bond financing and borrowed money.
Since then, however, a good deal of debt has been paid down via the
flotation on a minority interest in National Health Care Group, another
subsidiary, and via the sale of Max Factor and Betrix cosmetics to Procter &amp;
Gamble for Dollars 1.14bn.
According to recent analysts' reports, Revlon's debt had fallen from Dollars
2.38bn at December 1990, to Dollars 754m (on a pro forma basis) at year-end
1991.
The Equitable Life Assurance Society, the US life insurer which is
converting from mutual status to a shareholder-owned company, announced
yesterday that it plans to sell 43.5m shares to investors. It estimates that
the initial public offering price will be between Dollars 11 and Dollars 14
a share, raising up to Dollars 600m.
In addition to shares being sold in the IPO, The Equitable is distributing
shares to its policyholders and to Axa, the French insurer which injected
Dollars 1bn into the ailing US company last year. At the end of the process,

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Slough Estates, the UK property group, has made a Pounds 43m forward sale of
a department store in Cologne's main shopping precinct to an unnamed German
institution.
This is the largest deal completed by Slough in Germany, where it has
operated since 1974.
The 94,000 sq ft property, bought by Slough in 1988, has been pre-let to
Ludwig Beck, a Munich-based retailer, and is set to be finished in the
autumn of 1993.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Woodchester Investments, the Dublin-based small-ticket leasing and finance
group, has changed its name to Woodchester Credit Lyonnais Bank.
The move reflected what Mr Craig McKinney, Woodchester chairman, described
as the group's 'ambition to develop a full retail banking service in
Ireland'. The group intended to acquire 'around 40 to 50' retail banking
outlets in Ireland 'to be in a position to offer services that Credit
Lyonnais offers elsewhere in Europe'.
Mr Jean Yves Harberet, president of Credit Lyonnais, said his bank's tie-up
with Woodchester 'opens a window in Europe for the development of
Woodchester's leasing business'.

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Frogmore pays Pounds 15m for shopping
centre
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Frogmore Estates, the property company, has bought a shopping centre in
Hertfordshire from Norwich Union for Pounds 15.2m.
The 73,000 sq ft Spires Shopping Centre in Barnet, which was opened about
three years ago, has a rent roll of Pounds 1.64m, giving Frogmore a yield of
10.8 per cent. Five empty shops will increase the annual income to about
Pounds 1.8m when let.
The deal brings Frogmore's spending this year to over Pounds 40m. It said it
was increasing its weighting in retail property, which it believed would be
the first sector to recover.
Frogmore, which fought off a takeover bid a year ago, said its ability to
buy on historically high initial yields vindicated its earlier policy of
eliminating borrowings by selling property.

Mr John Ford, finance director of Evered Bardon, the aggregates group, since

Mr Peter Tom, group chief executive, said Mr Ford's departure reflected
Evered's current policy of consolidation after rapid expansion in the late
1980s. 'John is a financial director more suited to acquisitions. He wanted
to go off and do other things. We've parted the best of friends,' he said.
In February, Evered announced the disposal of two non-core businesses, and
three others in the US are up for sale. Cash raised will be used to reduce
gearing from 70 per cent towards 40 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Kelsey Industries incurred a loss of Pounds 119,000 in the six months to
March 31 but expects to be profitable in the second half.
However, it is certain the year will not match the Pounds 1.44m pre-tax made
in 1990-91, warned Mr Brian Arbib, chairman.
The interim dividend is held at 8p - the halfway profit was Pounds 1.11m
last time - but the rate of the final (18p) will be decided at the
appropriate time.
The group, a maker of roofing materials, audio and video accessories, and
solder, saw signs that the business climate, both in the UK and North
America, was changing slightly for the better.

Whitecroft has effectively reduced its borrowings by Pounds 1.97m via the
sale of Silcoms, its sole precision engineering subsidiary. This is a
further step in the disposal of peripheral activities and allows management
to focus on operations in lighting, building products, medical cotton fibre

In the year to March 31 1992 Silcoms made pre-tax profit of Pounds 383,000,
its net tangible assets were Pounds 721,000, and book value of property
Pounds 551,000. The purchaser was Bolton Engineering, owned by the present
directors of Silcoms, together with 3i Group.
Consideration for the sale was Pounds 1.35m and Whitecroft received a
dividend of Pounds 75,000.

<TEXT>
Increasing profitability from smaller subsidiaries enabled Andrews Sykes
Group to improve in the second half and produce a pre-tax profit of Pounds
1.2m for the year to March 31.
That compared with Pounds 1.32m last time. Turnover fell to Pounds 56.8m
(Pounds 62.6m) and operating profit to Pounds 3.44m (Pounds 4.29m) but
interest charges were cut to Pounds 2.24m (Pounds 2.98m).
Profit was struck after redundancy costs of Pounds 208,000, against last
year's Pounds 941,000 for redundancies and reorganisation.
Mr David Hubbard, chairman of this plant hire group, said cash flow
continued to be strong and bank borrowings were reduced by Pounds 3.3m with
gearing falling from 110 to 89 per cent.
Further action was taken to reduce overheads and staff numbers had been cut
by 14 per cent during the year.
After a substantially heavier tax charge, earnings per share fell to 1.2p
(3.2p). The final dividend is 3p for a maintained total of 4.4p.

A pre-tax loss of Pounds 306,000 was announced by Kitty Little Group, the
USM-quoted maker of fragrant gifts, air fresheners and self-selection
reading glasses, for the 11 months to December 31 1991.
For the 12 months to end-January 1991 there was a profit of Pounds 167,000.
Mr Grahan Webster, chairman, said that on a pro rata basis sales in the
fragrance division fell by 37 per cent and losses there were Pounds 285,000
(Pounds 514,000 profit).
Shardan, the toilet bag manufacturer, incurred losses of Pounds 108,000
(Pounds 106,000) after provisions for slow moving stock and bad debts.
However, following the acquisition of the minority interest in Magnivision -
now KL Eyecare - and the stock and goodwill of Ready Readers, both companies
had reported profits.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 4.23m (Pounds 6.8m). Net interest payable fell
to Pounds 224,000 (Pounds 369,000) and the company is concentrating on
reducing bank borrowings further by keeping a close control of working
capital requirements.
Losses per share amounted to 1.96p (0.19p earnings) and there is no dividend
(0.575p).

JMD Group, the greeting cards maker and novelty products merchandiser, cut
its pre-tax loss from Pounds 1.11m to just Pounds 89,000 in 1991.

loss on discontinued activities of Pounds 1.49m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAYTON ENGLISH and International Trust has seen its unquoted portfolio
suffer badly from the UK recession, leading to a number of write-offs and
provisions.
Its net asset value fell from 108.4p to 66p over the 12 months ended April 5
1992, although that had improved to 71.5p by the end of April.
Gross income for 1991-92 dropped from Pounds 6.07m to Pounds 4.4m, and net
revenue from Pounds 2.69m to Pounds 1.69m. Earnings per share were 0.71p
(3.16p) and the final dividend is cut to 0.6p (2.3p) for a total of 1.2p
(3.2p).
Resources were being focused into the UK quoted smaller company sector,
which currently accounted for 60 per cent of the portfolio.
Two other Drayton trusts have also reported their results:
Drayton Recovery, which began trading last October, produced gross revenue
of Pounds 931,000 for the period to April 30 1992, and net revenue of Pounds
594,000 for earnings per share of 7.19p.
An interim dividend of 2p is declared; a special of 2p has already been
paid.
Net asset value at April 30 was 98.9p.
Drayton Blue Chip, which began trading in March 1991, finished with gross
revenue of Pounds 1.8m for the period ended March 31 1992. Net income
reached Pounds 1.12m for earnings per share of 8.88p, and the final dividend
is 5.495p to make 8.4.
Over the six months to March 31 1992, net asset value fell from 89.4p to
60.5p.

Center Parcs, a subsidiary of Scottish &amp; Newcastle, the brewery and leisure
group, is building a holiday village in France at a cost of Pounds 75m.
Set in 300 acres of parkland near Sologne in the Loire Valley, the village
will comprise villas, a leisure complex, shops and restaurants. It is
expected to open in 1993, create 450 full and part-time jobs, and cater for
a potential 300,000 visitors a year.
Mr James Merrington, corporate affairs director, said approval was expected
shortly on a new UK site and negotiations had started with Belgian
authorities on another possible development.
The Sologne Center Parc will bring to 13 the number of complexes in Britain,
France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Scottish &amp; Newcastle's leisure division
 -which includes the Pontins holiday group - last year made pre-tax profits
of Pounds 65.5m on turnover of Pounds 300m.

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Mercury Asset advances 15% despite
provisions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MERCURY ASSET Manage-ment, the fund management group 75 per cent owned by SG
Warburg, achieved a 15 per cent rise in pre-tax profits last year despite
substantial provisions on two investments.
Pre-tax profits in the year to March 31 rose from Pounds 56.4m to Pounds
65.1m, reflecting the group's success in holding down costs. While turnover
jumped by Pounds 14.6m to Pounds 154m, costs rose by less than Pounds 1m to
Pounds 99.6m.
Mr Peter Stormonth Darling, chairman, said that investment in systems in
previous years to make the group's back office operations more efficient had
accounted for the low cost increase.
However, the group announced provisions of about Pounds 5m on two
investments at March 31, holding back its advance. Some Pounds 3m of this
was a write-down on its investment in Jupiter, a fund management group in
which MAM bought a 27 per cent stake for Pounds 7m last year. About half of
that provision might be written back because the value of MAM's holding had
recovered since the year-end, Mr Stormonth Darling said.
A further provision of more than Pounds 1m was made against a holding by MAM
in Isosceles, which it had taken on to its own books when unable to place
the shares with investment clients.
Funds under management rose by Pounds 2.7bn to Pounds 40bn. The Pounds 2bn
of new money under management, down from the record Pounds 3bn taken on the
previous year, reflected the slower rate at which cash was flowing into UK
pension funds.
Earnings were 25.4p (22.8p) basic and 25.1p (22.1p) diluted. A final
dividend of 8.9p is proposed, for a total of 11.5p (10p adjusted).

FT  27 MAY 92 / Brown Shipley to raise Pounds 43m in disposal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROWN SHIPLEY, the merchant banking group, is to sell two of its
subsidiaries. The group, which posted pre-tax losses of Pounds 3.34m in the
year to March 31, 1991, confirmed yesterday that overall losses for the year
ending March 31, 1992 would be 'substantial'.
It will earn some Pounds 33m from the sale of its profitable insurance
broking arm to Holmwoods Group, a company formed by the arm's senior
management. The sale of Brown Shipley's offshore company to Standard Bank
Investment Corporation of South Africa (SBIC) will net a further Pounds
10.25m.
Holmwoods, which has been advised by J O Hambro Magan, is to pay Pounds 30m
in cash plus two deeply discounted loan notes with aggregate nominal value
of Pounds 3m and final redemption dates in 1997 and 1998.
CINVen, manager of Pounds 600m of pension funds for British Coal, British
Rail and Barclays Bank Pension Funds, will provide 70 per cent of the equity
backing for the venture. Senior debt behind the deal has been underwritten
by the Bank of Scotland.
Holmwoods specialises in providing insurances for private schools and
colleges in the UK and the US, where it trades as AWG Dewar. Its other
activities include marine, corporate and personal insurance broking.
The insurance broking subsidiary was a profitable part of the Brown Shipley
group. Unaudited profits in the year to March 31, 1992 amounted to Pounds
3.5m, including exceptional items of Pounds 340,000, when shareholders'
funds amounted to Pounds 5.1m.
SBIC's payment for the offshore company is subject to an adjustment based on
the net assets of the offshore group, which specialises in banking,
stockbroking, investment management and fiduciary services, primarily from
its base in Jersey.
Discussions are also taking place with Woodchester Investments about the
terms of the sale of Lease Management Services, Brown Shipley's leasing
subsidiary. A memorandum of understanding has been exchanged.
Brown Shipley said its 'accounts for the full year ending March 31, 1992
would include sharply increased provisions for bad and doubtful debts,
resulting in a substantial overall loss. Against this background the
directors will not be recommending a final dividend.'

FT  27 MAY 92 / Japanese computer makers fall below expected earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S computer and semi-conductor makers yesterday reported
worse-than-expected earnings for the fiscal year just ended.
The parent companies of NEC, Toshiba, Mitsubishi Electric and Fujitsu
announced falls in pre-tax profits ranging from 43.1 per cent to 68.6 per
cent. They blamed the poor performance on a weak semiconductor market and,
in particular, falling prices for the latest generation of memory chip, the
4Mbit, on which they may never recoup their investments.
Sharp reported a smaller drop in profits - 11.9 per cent - although along
with other makers of consumer products, it reported a fall in demand for
audio-visual equipment.
Most of the chip makers' factories are running at well below capacity.
Toshiba, for example, produces about 300m of the 4Mbit chips, instead of the
planned 500m each month. In the past year, the price of those chips has more
than halved, to Y1,400 (Pounds 5.90) each.
As a result, Japanese companies which have dominated the memory chip market
in recent years, are cutting back on new semiconductor investment.
NEC said the industry had been hit by global recession and falls in domestic
capital expenditure and consumer spending.
Fujitsu, the world's second largest computer manufacturer, is hoping for a
25 per cent rise in profits, to Y50bn.
Mitsubishi Electric reported flat parent sales of heavy machinery,
industrial products and automation equipment. Air-conditioners were the
best-selling consumer line, but audio-visual equipment sales were weak.

FT  27 MAY 92 / S&amp;P gloomy on US property losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD &amp; POOR's, the credit rating service, yesterday offered a gloomy
assessment of the likely impact on US banks of loan losses from the
depressed US commercial property market.
The S&amp;P study warned that notwithstanding improved first-quarter 1992
earnings at a number of US banks, the worst was not yet over.
S&amp;P said it believed 'that the problem loan workout period will be
protracted and that the losses will have a long tail, reaching substantially
higher levels than they have to date'.
The report sought to dispel the idea that the effect of the worldwide
property depression on the US banking industry was waning.
The recent bankruptcy filings by Olympia &amp; York of Canada were cited by S&amp;P
as 'a vivid confirmation that real estate (property) markets have not begun
to recover or stabilise'.
Senior US bank executives have said in recent months they expect the level
of bad debt provisions caused by commercial property loans to remain at the
same level this year as in 1991.
But the S&amp;P report claimed that reserves at many banks are not yet adequate
to cover prospective commercial property losses.
S&amp;P predicted that 'the overhang of losses will continue to be a significant
drain on (banking) industry earnings over the next few years'.
The report said that S&amp;P's outlook for bank ratings remains stable, with
several banks unlikely to receive a ratings upgrade in the near term.
S&amp;P cited the experience of banks in Texas during the late 1980s property
slump as a worst-case scenario, and noted that loan write-offs at some Texas
institutions reached the level of 30 per cent of commercial property loan
portfolios.
The ratings service described as 'disturbing' that the level of
non-performing property loans at New York City banks was reaching the 40 per
cent range.
Loan losses would not be as high in other regions as they were in Texas and
the southwest, and should represent about 15 per cent of the original loan
portfolio value of most banks.
The loan losses could, however, reach the level of 25 per cent of
outstanding property loans at some banks, S&amp;P said.

FT  27 MAY 92 / EC weakens environment plans

<TEXT>
THE European Community's position at next week's Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro looks set to fall well short of what environment commissioner Carlo
Ripa di Meana has proposed, and his own attendance at the summit was last
night in doubt.
Environment ministers of the 12 yesterday agreed to sign the Climate Change
convention, due to be agreed in Rio, but they did not agree to endorse
politically the European Commission's plan to tax energy as a means of
curbing CO emissions, even though no EC state opposed the proposal.
Nor were they able to agree on a timetable for nearly doubling development
aid to a minimum of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to help
developing countries adopt more environmentally sound development
strategies.
Taken together, this is a limp posture when set against what Mr Ripa de
Meana had defined as the minimum 'dowry' the Community should take to Rio.
The Commission's plan is to stabilise CO emissions at 1990 levels by 2000,
through an energy tax equivalent to Dollars 10 a barrel of oil equivalent.
Mr Ripa di Meana says the EC can only deliver half that target without a
tax.
The plan won strong support yesterday from Germany, Denmark, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy. The first four attacked the Commission
for making introduction of the tax conditional on the US and Japan adopting
similar measures.
France and the UK reserved their position behind procedure, since the
Commission overshot its deadline in producing the detailed draft directive,
which it will look at today.
'The UK position remains that when we see it, we will study it in detail,'
Mr Michael Howard, UK environment secretary, said of the tax plan.

FT  27 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: SG Warburg
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It may be gratifying for SG Warburg to unveil Pounds 71m of previously
hidden reserves, but that also creates a large slice of additional capital
on which it has to make an acceptable return. Yesterday's annual results
show that only Pounds 3m would have been added to hidden reserves in 1991-92
had they still been in place. So the extra capital may prove something of a
millstone, although Warburg will need to be well-capitalised to meet EC
securities company regulations. That in turn creates a requirement for a
steady flow of large issues, whatever conditions in the market, if the
capital is to be used efficiently. Net return on capital last year was only
12 per cent.
Mercury Asset Management's provisions against its investments in Jupiter
Tyndall and Isosceles are a real but transitory embarrassment. More worrying
is the fact that, thanks to pension fund holidays, it only attracted some
Pounds 2bn of new money last year. Since it cannot continue to cut costs for
ever, MAM must break into the nascent European pension fund market to secure
future growth.
The chances are that a smooth operator such as Warburg can cope with these
problems better than most. But the road ahead is difficult. A yield of 4 per
cent offers only limited compensation for investors, even if the scare
surrounding February's so-called profit warning was overdone.

FT  27 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Mountleigh
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It is not entirely clear why the banks should have pulled the plug on
Mountleigh, as opposed to any of the other walking wounded in the UK
property sector. The lenders, to be sure, already have their hands on most
of the available security, and have no obvious incentive to throw Pounds 56m
of good money after potentially obstreperous bondholders. Mountleigh,
though, is hardly unique in this respect. Perhaps in the end patience simply
ran out with a company whose conspicuous extravagance had become a symbol of
the late 1980s and whose top-heavy 14 man board was disparagingly but aptly
described by one small shareholder at the last annual meeting as a football
team with three reserves.
Judging by the market's calm reaction to the news yesterday, it may be that
the wider implications are indeed slight. After all, everyone knew that
Mountleigh's assets had to be sold to repay its debts: all that has happened
is that the administrator rather than the company will now get on with the
task. The problem with this cosy theory is that the timetable for disposals
will now presumably be that much tighter, the risk being that today's forced
sellers ultimately become the market. With very few signs of a pick-up in
demand vendors in the commercial property sector may prove to be behaving as
unrealistically as home owners throughout most of last year. The banks have
to balance the cost of further rescues against the damage to confidence and
the impact on their balance sheets of letting other companies go bust. It is
a delicate and dangerous game.

FT  27 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK economy
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Any lingering doubts that recovery is under way should have been dispelled
by yesterday's trade figures showing import volume grew an underlying 4 1/2
per cent in the three months to April. That, however, is about the extent of
the good news. It might be possible to interpret the import surge as a sign
that recovery is already robust, but that would scarcely be consistent with
other available data. The depressing conclusion is that even a weak recovery
is enough to push the trade figures heavily into the red, possibly because
loss of capacity during the recession has left the economy with bottlenecks.
Granted, a large trade deficit does not matter in the short term because
foreign money is flowing abundantly into post-election Britain. There is a
reasonable chance that the estimates for invisible earnings, which have been
running at Pounds 300m a month since the start of the year, will be revised
upwards. By contrast, export performance has not yet been affected by any
slowdown that may hit the rest of Europe as a result of the Bundesbank
squeeze. Heavy inflows into the gilts market may have created a breathing
space but adjustment will be inevitable before long. Since ERM membership
gives the UK little independent control over its monetary policy, the brunt
will have to be born on the fiscal side.

FT  27 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Dowsing the grid
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Whatever the outcome of the latest government inquiry, a national grid for
the UK water industry is likely to remain a distant prospect. Practical
objections aside, it is perhaps worth recalling that the principal
attraction of privatising water was to remove the industry's capital
spending requirements from public sector finances. It is scarcely
conceivable that the government would approve the huge increases in spending
needed to build a national supply network. By way of example, the 50 miles
of the London ring main is costing Thames Water around Pounds 250m.
Granted, the issue of who would pay for the grid is clouded, but there is
little chance of the companies stumping up. As the forthcoming results
season will remind them, consumers already face steady real increases in
water bills. The case for further rises is unlikely to appeal to
politicians. Nor would investors in water shares have much to cheer about.
In addition to capital costs, there would be ongoing operating expenses for
pumping water around the country. Should UK rainfall return to historic
levels, a large project might end in embarrassment.
All the same, the politicians' surge of interest could have beneficial
effects. If the regulator agreed, water companies' spending on improvements
to their leaking underground pipes could be brought forward at the expense
of other work. In time, that would ease the supply problem.
A faster introduction of metering might have the same effect on consumption.
Water company chairmen have long maintained that their biggest problem is
consumers' wasteful attitude to the resource. Changing that is perhaps a
sufficient long-term challenge for the industry. More immediately, the
shares will doubtless be supported by a regulatory regime that still allows
dividends to be increased at roughly twice the average market rate.

FT  27 MAY 92 / EC moves closer to trade ban on Serbia as Major speaks out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, LAURA SILBER and JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WARSAW, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community last night moved closer to a trade ban and other
sanctions against Serbia as officials of the 12 member nations, meeting in
Brussels, agreed on recommendations to ministers.
The drive for sanctions gained further momentum as Mr John Major, visiting
central Europe, condemned the role of Serbian forces in provoking ethnic
conflict in breakaway Yugoslav republics. Before leaving Warsaw for Prague,
the prime minister called for mandatory United Nations sanctions to force an
end to the fighting.
British officials travelling with Mr Major said ambassadors of UN Security
Council nations in New York had prepared a draft UN sanctions resolution
against Serbia. But France was said to be resisting the inclusion of oil
trade in any package of sanctions.
The officials gathered in Brussels left open whether the EC should act alone
or through the UN. Their recommended package of sanctions will be
scrutinised at a meeting of EC ambassadors today, but EC ministers might not
meet until next week to decide on it.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, called at the weekend for tough
sanctions against Serbia, and both the US and Canada have cut air links with
Belgrade. EC countries and the US have already announcing withdrawal of
diplomats from Belgrade.
Mr Major made clear Britain was pressing for mandatory measures including an
oil embargo, a break in civil air links with Belgrade and more general trade
sanctions.
He was aware when he made his remarks that France is reluctant to agree to
significant sanctions. But he indicated Britain was determined to press
ahead regardless. His calculation is that Paris will not in the end be able
to resist international pressure for sanctions.
Mr Major set out a series of conditions which the west should demand before
lifting a threat against Serbia. They included a ceasefire in the breakaway
republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina, Serbian action to control its irregular
forces, resumption of constitutional talks and guarantees to let refugees
return home.
Echoing the hard line taken by Washington on international sanctions, Mr
Major demanded also that troops of the Yugoslav federal army be withdrawn
from the republic of Croatia.
Diplomats in Brussels said France wanted any trade embargo, particularly on
oil, to be channelled through the Security Council. France argued that
because the EC supplied only about 10 per cent of Serbia's oil, an embargo
would work only if backed by such countries as Iran, China and Russia.
In an effort to head off the campaign for sanctions, Serbia promised to 'do
its utmost' to get humanitarian aid to Bosnia.
At the same time Mr Andrei Kozyrev, the Russian foreign minister, announced
a deal in Sarajevo to reopen the blockaded city's airport. He said a
ceasefire would take effect today so that emergency supplies of food and
medicines could be flown in.
The airport has been under blockade since early April, first by the federal
army and now by Serbian irregulars.

FT  27 MAY 92 / ITV to issue writ over soccer deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES and RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV companies last night said they planned to issue a writ today against
the new Premier League for alleged breach of confidence.
ITV failed yesterday in its attempt in the High Court to get an injunction
to block the Pounds 304m five year joint British Sky Broadcasting-BBC deal
for football television rights, which would have given ITV the chance to
increase its Pounds 262m bid.
But Mr Trevor East, ITV's executive producer for football said after the
hearing: 'We are encouraged to hear that the High Court believes we have an
arguable case for breach of confidence, and therefore we plan to issue a
writ tomorrow against the Premier League for damages that we believe could
be substantial.'
ITV claimed it had been put at an unfair disadvantage because its bid had
been leaked to BSkyB by Mr Rick Parry, the league's chief executive, just
before the meeting on Monday last week when the Premier League clubs
considered the offers.
Mr Justice Ferris said the league had clearly indicated it would not be
prepared to consider a new offer from ITV and it could not possibly be right
to make an order forcing it to do so.
The judge added that ITV could return to court for a full hearing of its
case and the court might take a different view - 'although I very much doubt
it'.
Mr Frank Barlow, chairman of BSkyB, said the decision had confirmed his
faith in British justice.
Mr Barlow, who is also managing director of Pearson, which has a significant
stake in BSkyB and owns the Financial Times, described the unsuccessful ITV
attempt to obtain an injunction as 'an act of despair'.
BSkyB rights to live Premier League games - the BBC will show recorded
highlights - would 'open up a whole range of commercial options', Mr Barlow
said.
He declined to elaborate. One option is to make Premier League football
available without extra charge on Sky Sport to encourage the public to buy
satellite dishes. New revenue would then come from persuading them to
subscribe to film channels. Another option is to scramble Sky Sport and
charge a Pounds 5 per month subscription fee for it from the outset and
move, at a later stage, to pay-as-you-view for top matches.
After yesterday's hearing Mr Parry said he was relieved by the outcome. 'We
have achieved a demonstrably better deal for the clubs and the league as a
whole - and that was the only issue from our point of view,' he said.
Mr Christopher Carr QC, for ITV, had argued that the contract with BSkyB had
been procured by breach of confidence. Mr Parry had 'communicated sufficient
of the terms of the ITV bid to enable BSkyB to formulate a new claim which
took account of the ITV bid'.
That had breached an implied term that ITV's bid would be treated in
confidence and not revealed to a rival bidder.
Mr Carr claimed that the league and BSkyB had finalised their contract 'with
unseemly haste' on Thursday in an attempt to defeat any High Court action.
In evidence read to the court, Mr Parry said he had told Mr Sam Chisholm,
BSkyB's chief executive, of ITV's offer - though not the figure.

The last amateur cricketer to lead a county championship winning side, Colin
Ingleby-Mackenzie, faces a challenge of a different order as head of the
management buy-out team at insurance brokers Holmwoods.
Ingleby-Mackenzie, who won national sporting fame when he led Hampshire's
successful side during the late 1950s and early 1960s, is skippering the
Pounds 33m move for Holmwoods, a subsidiary of merchant banking group Brown
Shipley which has hitherto specialised in finding insurance for private
schools. Already solidly profitable, it seems well placed to take advantage
of the increasing flexibility with which public-sector schools are being
run.
Among the 50-strong management team involved in the buy-out is another
former county captain, Nick Pocock, a successor of Ingleby-Mackenzie at
Hampshire, while Carl Openshaw, director of finance and development, is a
third cricketing buff - albeit a Kentishman.

'If you shake my hand on a deal then you had better be absolutely bloody
sure you know what you are shaking it for' is the latest Peter de Savary
message.
Observer hopes the movers and shakers behind BusinessAge also know what they
have let themselves in for. Tom Rubython, who has created the new magazine -
featuring the said de Savary as its cover story - out of the embers of the
late Management Week, is certainly amazed. 'The investors have left it
completely to us. It's very odd, isn't it?'
Rubython, former editor of Management Week, which folded in December, had
the idea of approaching 2,000 subscribers of the ill-fated publication to
see if they would invest in the new venture. A total of Pounds 900,000 was
raised from 171 backers. One name featured in the Sunday Times list of
Britain's 300 richest men sent Pounds 300,000 on condition his identity
remained secret. Most reader-investors, who together control 80 per cent of
the equity, have invested between Pounds 100 and Pounds 10,000.
With such a disparate range of shareholders, Rubython is convinced he will
have total editorial freedom. But not everyone will be completely satisfied
with the new magazine. In a letter published in the first issue, John Gammon
of Hawkshead Consultants said he was disappointed with Management Week
because there were too many articles about the likes of Donald Trump and
Madonna.
And what is on page 66 of BusinessAge? Madonna: America's Smartest
Businesswoman.

A charter has come to the aid of Citizen Major.
On his first foreign trip since the election victory, the prime minister is
travelling around Central Europe on an aircraft more used to ferrying
holidaymakers on cut-price package tours. When Major decided three weeks ago
to travel to Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia, the RAF regretted there
were simply no VC10s available to accommodate him and his entourage. So John
and Norma find themselves on an ancient BAC 1-11 chartered from British Air
Ferries.
When introduced in the 1960s, the aircraft was undoubtedly ahead of its time
but in more recent years has been consigned to the Stansted-Jersey holiday
run.
Major may be unphased by having to sit in economy just a few rows ahead of
the travelling press. But the class-conscious political hacks have already
pledged themselves to decorous silence if on future trips the man of the
people opts for an aeroplane more appropriate to their status.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Observer: Pohl's golden opportunity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Canadian financiers with fingers in the property pie are hardly flavour of
the month among the international banking fraternity these days. But Peter
Munk, Toronto entrepreneur par excellence, is clearly different. How else
has the smooth-talking, fine-wine-loving Munk managed to lure Karl Otto Pohl
onto the board of his gold, oil and property holding company Horsham
Corporation?
Since stepping down from the Bundesbank, Pohl has lined up an impressive
string of blue-chip directorships - including Bertelsmann, Unilever and
Royal Dutch Shell. Having turned down hosts of other worthy causes, he was
obviously in the market for a touch of excitement.
But what, in turn, can the owner of American Barrick, a leading North
American gold producer, and Clark Oil, a US Midwest oil refiner, want with a
former German central banker, however noted?
A Hungarian emigre who has been in Canada for more than 30 years, Munk still
retains a soft spot for Europe and Europeans. He has a ski chalet at
Klosters, and another prominent German, Nato secretary-general Manfred
Worner, was a guest of the Munks on his most recent Canadian trip.
Never dull on the subject of French wines, Munk would like Pohl's reputed
ability to be able to distinguish between 200 sorts of grappa.
And while he would not primarily be seeking advice on the gold or oil
markets, Munk must undoubtedly be hoping the new big name addition to the
board will grease the wheels of a recent foray into Germany.
Horsham owns 195 hectares on the outskirts of Berlin which it wants to turn
into a business park and entertainment complex and has its eyes on other
properties. Pohl's help should be invaluable in the search for financial
partners - and tenants.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Italy's need for reform
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SOMETIMES seems to take a shock to make Italians realise that urgent
action is required to avert a national crisis. It needed such a shock, in
the form of popular indignation at the murder of the courageous anti-mafia
magistrate, Mr Giovanni Falcone, to shame Italy's squabbling politicians
into electing a new president.
The insults hurled by mourners at Mr Falcone's funeral against leading
politicians, including Mr Spadolini, the justice minister, reflected growing
public outrage at the incapacity of the authorities to clamp down on the
mafia's overlords. Thanks mainly to the efforts of individual judges
prepared to risk their lives, successive crime and corruption scandals have
brought to light the links between the mafia and some sections of the
political establishment and the police.
Until recently, corrupt practices were associated mainly with the Christian
Democratic party, the ruling party throughout most of the post-Second World
War era. But arrests made in the latest corruption scandal in Milan have
demonstrated that the cancer has spread to other political groups,
particularly former prime minister Bettino Craxi's Socialist party.
So it is hardly any wonder that the Italian people have become more and more
disillusioned with the old guard of politicians. The voters fired a powerful
shot across their bows in the general election at the beginning of last
month, when they deprived the outgoing four-party coalition of its overall
parliamentary majority. The long-dominant Christian Democrats won less than
30 per cent of the overall vote for the first time.
Signally failed
The result was widely interpreted not only as a rejection of the old
political parties - no fewer than 16 parties are represented in the new
parliament - but as a desire for a reform of a political system which has
signally failed to provide stable government.
The farcical scenes which characterised the early rounds of the presidential
election this month were a reversion to old-style Italian political
practices and a negation of what the electorate appears to want. But the one
positive outcome of the assassination of Mr Falcone is that it has brought
the politicians to their senses. The business of forming a new government
can now begin in earnest.
The choice of Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro as president appears to be a good one.
While he is a veteran member of the Christian Democratic party, his support
has come from all parties. Above all Mr Scalfaro has a reputation for
incorruptibility and is thus the man for the moment. Although his powers as
head of state are strictly limited, he has considerable influence on the
government-building process. That is important at a time when speed and good
judgment are of the essence.
Main tasks
One of the new president's main tasks will be to persuade the politicians
and the country as a whole that Italy has no more time to waste. Though a
signatory of last year's Maastricht Treaty, Italy has yet to persuade its
European partners that it can fulfil either the conditions of the projected
economic and monetary union or the political union. It is still a very long
way from meeting any of the economic convergence criteria laid down for full
membership of Emu. More fundamentally, its partners must wonder whether it
will be able to enforce the directives and other Community-wide legal
instruments laws agreed collectively.
The remedies are not difficult to find. Tough measures must be taken to
bring the public deficit and debt under control, to cut subsidies to state
industry and to reform the pensions system. Equally important is the fight
against corruption and gangsterism. An important part of the solution will
be an agressive programme of privatisation. This can only be done by a
strong government, requiring a radical reform of the present electoral
system.
The fundamental condition for achieving all this is political will, which
has so far been lacking. That resolution may now be provided by pressure
from a people who seem finally to have had enough of political instability
and corruption. Italy's politicians must be made to understand that there is
no room for further procrastination.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Arts: Jenufa - Opera at Glyndebourne
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Glyndebourne brings back its 1989 production of Jenufa. Three years ago it
was already a noble achievement; now it must be deemed one of the festival's
unarguable triumphs, superlatively well sung, played, acted and conducted -
an experience of 'small-house' Janacek opera, close-meshed in ensemble, that
proves almost too much to bear.
Stumbling back at the end, blinded by tears and stirred to the marrow, into
the civilised Glyndebourne world of Pimms and picnic baskets may be one of
life's odder experiences. It is certainly one of British opera's most
meaningful and valuable.
The tone of the revival - urgent in momentum, never driven in pace - is set
by the musical direction of Yakov Kreizberg, the young Russian making his
British debut. On this showing he would appear to possess a talent for
genuinely dramatic opera-conducting of a rare order.
The sonorities drawn from the LPO are no longer refulgently Straussian and
string-based, as they were first time round, but athletic,
woodwind-dominated - lots of lyrically insistent oboe and plangent bassoon
to the fore - and stamped by an airy clarity of texture that lets through
the voices and allows the angular phrase-nuggets to soar.
The cleaned-up Mackerras-Tyrrell edition used by Glyndebourne sounds not
just leanly magnificent but fiercely right; the pulse-beat of the music,
keen yet steady, is made indistinguishable from that of Nikolaus Lehnhoff's
severely beautiful staging.
The two leading sopranos of 1989, Roberta Alexander in the title role and
Anja Silja as the sextoness, have returned to the production, to its
incalculable benefit. They find in its acutely judged confines an ideal
space for creating character through voices and bodies.
Miss Silja's gaunt tragic radiance was from the first on the highest level
of music-drama, a triumph of sweeping imaginative perception fully realised;
now Miss Alexander is every bit her equal, with sweet yet sinewy singing and
a heartbreaking quiet warmth of bearing.
The two play to each other's strengths with glorious freedom, subtlety and
generosity. When they are on stage together, alone or alongside Menai Davies
(grandmother), Angela Hickey (mayoral wife) and Elen ap Robert (Karolka),
all superb, Jenufa demands to be accounted the great Woman's Opera.
But since Kim Begley's heroically sung Laca and Kurt Schreibmayer's trimly
handsome Steva (a touch unsteady of voice at climaxes) arrive at the same
full-blooded roundness of characterisation, it is in the end Janacek's
sublime honesty of vision that Glyndebourne celebrates.
In repertory until July 17

FT  27 MAY 92 / Arts: Philadelphia Orchestra
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For the London stopover on their European tour the Philadelphia Orchestra
brought a refreshingly unhackneyed programme to the Festival Hall. There was
none of box-office-safe Beethoven or Brahms with which visiting orchestras
too often shore up their concerts - the big romantic symphony was Skryabin's
Second, and the orchestral showpieces placed before it were Elgar's concert
overture In the South and Casella's Paganiniana.
The current tour is the last the orchestra will undertake with Riccardo Muti
as Music Director; he leaves at the end of the current season to be replaced
by Wolfgang Sawallisch. On the evidence of Monday's concert Muti will
bequeath to his successor an ensemble as fine as any in the world at
present.
There are no detectable faults in any department of the orchestra; the sound
is supple and refined, founded upon a wonderfully homogeneous string
section, with wind principals, brass as much as woodwind, of limpid phrasing
and elegant individuality. The personality of the orchestra is never
intrusive; it offers carte blanche to a conductor who knows his stuff to
apply his own characterisations and nuances. The sound world on offer,
though, is not one to suit precisely every part of the orchestral repertory.
In this particular programme that mattered not at all, particularly with
Muti's bracing attacks on rhythms and dynamics to add contours and life to
the immaculate surfaces.
Casella's four-movement suite was an innocuous start. Commissioned to
celebrate the centenary of the Vienna Philharmonic in 1942, it was hardly
born under a lucky star, and does little but run the departments of the
orchestra through some showy neoclassical paces.
In the South has long been a Muti party-piece; he conducted it in London
during his years with the Philharmonia, and has preserved the freshness and
vigour of his approach intact. There was a real Mediterranean tang to its
flavours, intense theatricality in its extraordinary depiction of the might
of the Roman empire, a daring sweep and thrust to the phrasing. It is the
most (Richard) Straussian of all Elgar's works, and delivered without
English pastoral preconceptions becomes a thrilling piece of orchestral
description.
The longueurs of Skryabin's Second are less easy to transmute; a work which
never says anything in eight bars which could profitably be extended to 80
needs all the care and attention a conductor can provide. Muti gave the
impression of believing in every one of its blasts of rhetoric; even the C
major finale, piling banality upon banality, was given its full measure.
Earlier the langourous melodies and queasy modulations had been sifted and
coloured most beautifully by the Philadelphia strings; a better case for the
work could not have been made.
After such a peerless demonstration of orchestral virtuosity, an encore was
inevitable - an orchestral arrangement of a piano Notturno by Giuseppe
Martucci, a favourite piece of Toscanini as Muti told us from the rostrum,
and played here with hushed eloquence and burnished tone.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Arts: Malvern Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Malvern hills threatened to ring with unaccustomed music at the weekend,
as thousands of hippies gathered for an impromptu festival. This is the home
of Edward Elgar and the uninvited visitors had taken over the very area
where the great English composer conceived some of his finest music.
By coincidence it was also the central weekend of the official Malvern
Festival. As one might expect, Elgar is traditionally the presiding spirit
in the hall at Great Malvern which bears his name. This year, however, the
festival programme has featured Robert Simpson as Composer in Residence.
Four of his works received premieres, funded entirely by the festival after
other sources failed to come up with finance: a symphony, a string quartet
and concertos for flute and cello.
Simpson has always been concerned with the renewal of classical forms and
these four pieces have imposed on them his usual rigour of form.
The Eleventh Symphony is lighter than its immediate predecessors. Simpson
has written for a chamber orchestra and made a conscious effort to keep the
textures transparent.
The symphony lasts half an hour. It is in two movements, the first slow and
moody like Shostakovich, the second playful at first, then forcefully
dramatic. The teasing final pay-off, in which the brooding music is swept
aside with a flick of the wrist, recalls the end of the Fourth Symphony of
Beethoven.
The symphony was written for the conductor, Matthew Taylor, towards whom the
composer was generous with his praise, but the City of London Sinfonia
performed as if it had yet to get the technical difficulties under its belt.
On Sunday, the orchestra returned to give the first performance of the Flute
Concerto, now conducted by Richard Hickox and with Susan Milan the eloquent
soloist.
Of the two premieres which I heard, this was the more attractive. The flute
writing is delightful, delicately balanced between decoration and substance;
the structure is novel.
From a fanciful scherzo-like opening, the concerto slowly winds down until
it metamorphoses into an intimate quintet, producing a thought-provoking
ending as the music turns ever more pensively in upon itself.
The loss made on mounting the premieres means the festival will be returning
to more traditional fare next year. Elgar is the likely focus of attention -
bands of roving hippies notwithstanding.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Arts: Spitting contest for grown men - Television
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER DUNKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Does soccer sometimes seem to you little more than a spitting contest for
grown men? Does it strike you as absurd that they spend all that energy
producing, typically, a one-nil score? Are you appalled at the way tackled
players fling themselves to the ground and go through pantomimes of agony
until they realise nobody is watching? Then, like me, your first reaction to
the news that ITV was stitched up by BSkyB (or Sky as we shall call it) with
the sly assistance of the BBC ('Yes let's sling a brick through their window
why don't you') may have been quiet satisfaction. At last they are taking
away this infantile exhibition and sticking it on a separate channel where
we won't have to watch it.
There are, of course, second thoughts. For a start, there is a lot of soccer
outside the Premiere League and, as the BBC proved when it lost the
athletics and boxing contracts which had previously given it the top
contests, it is possible to make fairly impressive bricks with low grade
straw, if you happen to be an outstanding programme maker with a lot of
experience and a well established tradition of sustaining the sports
infrastructure.
So, even viewers without a dish are likely to find quite a bit of this awful
game still on their screens. Secondly, though the consensus is that Sky has
achieved a great coup, the proof of the pudding will be in the eating:
Pounds 304m is a huge sum, and not all the big sports deals of recent years
have proved profitable to television.
Most significantly, perhaps, the deal is the most vivid example yet of what
the Thatcherites meant when they talked about bringing free market economics
to television. In the very week that the BBC's top management was told yet
again that it would have to cut more staff and introduce further economies
to justify its claim on the licence fee - Pounds 80 a year, or less than
Pounds 6.70 a month for two television channels and five radio networks - we
learn from Mr Rupert Murdoch's Sunday Times that, thanks to the Sky coup,
'by next year homes wanting to watch football are likely to be paying an
average of Pounds 22 a month for the privilege' to Mr Murdoch's Sky TV.
Thus what was, until recently, available as cheap viewing for everybody
under the much derided BBC/ITV duopoly is to become a Pounds 22-a-month
'privilege' for those who can afford it. Is this really an improvement in
British life? If the deal does work, dish sales do shoot up, and Sky does
bring in that pay system, two groups will presumably benefit greatly: the
clubs in the Premiere League, and Sky shareholders. . . which include those
of us on the FT who took up share options in the parent company, Pearson,
long before it became one of Sky's main shareholders.
It would be short-sighted or dishonest, or both, to pretend changes of this
sort are due exclusively to the actions of politicians. The days of
wavelength scarcity with the resultant automatic domination of public
service broadcasting are gone. It is possible today to have entire channels
dedicated to sports: anyone with a Sky dish pointing at the Astra satellite
is already receiving three. The relationship between viewers and, say,
football clubs is affected as much by developing technology as by
politicians. However, politicians can greatly help or hinder, and it is
impossible to avoid the feeling the present lot are intent upon helping
outfits such as Sky.
I had hoped to be able to turn from soccer to the arts, specifically to
BBC2's season under the awkward umbrella title 'Commissions And
Collaborations', and declare 'There, you see? Thanks to its popular base
that's what the BBC can do, and does do, and ought to be encouraged to go on
doing, because nobody else has ever managed to do it better, and nobody else
has done it (well or badly) at such low unit costs'. But of course life is
rarely so simple: 'Commissions And Collaborations' turns out to be a
decidedly odd mixture.
Some of its items are certainly fresh and exciting. For instance Cross
Channel, a half hour programme choreographed by Lea Anderson and directed by
Margaret Williams, is one of the best television dance programmes (dance
specifically created for television) that I have ever seen. The all-female
Cholmondeleys go to Calais while the all-male Featherstonehaughs camp on the
white cliffs of Dover, and around this Anderson creates a delightfully funny
ballet of the banal: the men using all the gestures of the car packers on
the ferry, the women reading newspapers on the boat, the men building human
pyramids the way people do on beaches.
Everything works, from the music to the brilliant ice-cream colours, and
above all the way in which television is exploited to expand the potential
of dance. Location shooting is a huge advantage. At one point the girls, for
some reason in white debs' dresses from the 1950s, dance in a hotel corridor
in Calais while the boys are performing on the English cliffs: the music is
the sole common strand, but that is all that is needed to bridge the
Channel.
Nearly the same can be said for two or three of the five-minute programmes
in the 12-strong Dance House which started last night and is currently
appearing each night at 7.55. Programme 5 created by Belinda Neave and Peter
Mumford makes good use of television's tricks: slo-mo, constant replay, a
sequence in which a dancer goes tumbling down a passage, the invisible edits
making it seem as though the passage and consequently the dance are endless.
In No. 10 Kim Brandstrup and Ross MacGibbon offer a 5-minute Cinderella,
reminding us (and, it must be hoped, some of the other programme makers)
that narrative is not something to be ashamed about. Best of all is the last
piece, by Aletta Collins which, like Cross Channel, has the advantage of
location filming, good music and humour.
Too many of the others were made by people who seem to have been unaware
that they were working in television. Had they spent an hour watching the
pop videos on MTV or Lifestyle's Satellite Jukebox, both available to owners
of Astra dishes, they would have seen Wacko Jacko or his sister, or Mylene
Farmer, and realised that there is already a lot of dance expertise on
television.
In The Mystery Of Dr Martinu, Ken Russell appeared to have retrogressed to
some point before A Song Of Summer, his unforgettable programme about Delius
made for the BBC 24 years ago. The Billboard Project seems downright
contrary; it may make sense for a broadcasting organisation to support
orchestras since they make programmes, but why pay artists to produce ersatz
ads for street hoardings instead of working in television? If artists must
be induced to ape advertisements why not television commercials?
Artists' Journeys look like conventional art appreciation programmes, the
quality depending largely on the charisma and articulacy of the presenter,
Avigdor Arikha being inspiring on Velasquez but Jim Dine (next Sunday)
somewhat gnomic and private on Munch.
These programmes do not look like a carefully planned season, they look like
an odd assortment shoved together under one umbrella as an afterthought in
the hope of creating extra publicity. Some are good, some are poor, and the
billboard exercise seems a questionable way to spend licence fees (assuming
that is where the money came from). Despite all that, 'Commissions And
Collaborations' contains programmes of a sort which it is difficult to
imagine will ever be produced by the sort of organisation which intends to
charge you Pounds 22 a month solely to watch soccer.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Too few fish in the sea /
Describing why the livelihood of New England fishermen is threatened by
reduced quotas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTORIA GRIFFITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sonny McIntire, an aging Maine fisherman, drew his boat into harbour with a
visible frown on his face. Together with his two sons, he inspected their
daily catch, then slowly shook his head. 'We put out twice the traps we used
to and catch half as many lobsters,' he said sadly.
McIntire's complaints are echoed throughout the once-thriving fishing
villages that dot New England's jagged coast. The fishing industry, an
important part of the region's economy, has been thrown into chaos as
fishing trips bring in ever shrinking yields.
The reason for the problem is simple - there are too many fishermen in the
sea. During the 1970s and 1980s, the federal government saw fishing as the
perfect way to stimulate the New England economy. It offered low interest
rates on boats, and tax incentives for anyone wanting to get started.
The region applauded the efforts as a way to boost a pollution-free
industry. But no one was prepared for the ecological disaster which
followed. Marine biologists say the situation has never been more critical,
and that the bio-mass of some stocks - particularly haddock and redfish -
has dwindled to less than 10 per cent of its original level.
Now, the fishermen find themselves caught in a painful situation. To make
more money, they need to catch more fish, but to increase the number of fish
in the ocean they have to catch fewer. Despite the hard times, fishermen say
they are still managing to scrape out a living, but that could soon change.
Federal laws set to go into effect soon would cut the region's fishing
quotas to just a fraction of their former levels. 'It could put most of us
out of business,' said Joe Testaverde, a Gloucester fisherman.
New England fishermen are especially bitter about proposals to slash their
tuna quota. Prodded by the International Commission for Conservation of
Atlantic Tuna, the US government agreed to cut its bluefin tuna harvest 10
per cent by 1993. Moreover, the National Marine Fisheries Service decided to
increase quotas for recreational tuna angling.
'I just don't understand,' said McIntire, who switches from lobster to tuna
during the summer months. 'Weekend fishermen could just catch and release,
but we need to make a living.' Sports anglers catch some 40 per cent of the
65,000 tuna landed in the US each year, according to Andrew Applegate,
analyst at the New England Fisheries Management Council.
The catch has been well in excess of their legal quota, since recreational
fishermen are subject to little government monitoring. Because they overrun
their limits by such a large margin, recreational fishermen have
successfully argued that their quotas are too small. Over the next few
months, their official limit is set to more than double.
William Fox, assistant administrator of fisheries, insists recreational
fishermen have not been given preferential treatment. 'They will suffer more
than commercial fishermen from some of the new rules, including ones which
forbid the landing of smaller fish,' he says.
The bluefin tuna, a fast, crafty fish which can reach up to 12 feet in
length, has attracted the attention of environmental activists around the
world. Because the fish can migrate large distances - some marine biologists
claim to have tracked the fish over thousands of miles - ecologists formed
an international commission to help protect the species.
The bluefin is popular with sportsmen because it is notoriously difficult to
catch. The fish is popular with commercial fishermen for another reason: it
is extremely profitable. Most of the tuna landed in the US is sold for about
Dollars 10 a pound to consumers in Japan, who consider the bluefin a
delicacy.
Since the giant fish reaches about 700-800 pounds, a single catch can yield
Dollars 8,000 or more. The International Commission for Conservation of
Atlantic Tuna has been pushing for more controls on tuna fishing for at
least a decade. A widely-agreed 10 per cent quota reduction represents one
of its biggest victories, but the commission continues to battle for even
stricter controls.
The reduction in tuna quotas is just one of the problems facing New England
fishermen, though. Two US environmental groups, the Audubon Society and the
Conservation Law Foundation, entered a lawsuit last year against the
National Marine Fisheries Service for allowing the stocks of groundfish -
such as cod and haddock - to fall to dangerously low levels.
In response to the lawsuit, the federal government asked the New England
Fisheries Management Council to come up with new rules to revitalise the
fish population. The council proposed halving the number of days fishermen
can spend at sea, a suggestion which angers the fishermen.
In the New England fishing village of Gloucester, fishermen attended a
public meeting recently where they presented an alternative plan. The
Gloucester Plan, as it has been dubbed, accepts some reductions in fishing,
but far less than those proposed by the Management Council.
After the meeting broke up, the fishermen and their families lingered to air
their concerns. 'They say 'get another job' but there is no other job,' said
Daniel Sullivan, who works on one of the boats in the area. Unemployment in
the Gloucester, at 15 per cent, is one of the highest in Massachusetts.
Some New England fishermen call for federal subsidies to help buoy them
through the crisis. Others favour the use of hatcheries and investment in
the development of better fishing technology to reduce the rates of fish
mortality on the seas.
'Many of the fish die unnecessarily,' admits fisherman Joseph Cracchiolo.
'They are too small to sell, and we have to throw them back in the sea dead.
If we had better equipment, that wouldn't happen.'
The National Marine Fisheries Service, however, believes hatcheries would be
ineffectual. Moreover, they warn that tighter fishing quotas could be in the
pipeline.
Most fishermen know that something needs to be done. But they worry that if
they cut back further, they will be forced to get out of the business
altogether.
For many, who have been in fishing families for four or even five
generations, the thought is painful. 'It's a way of life,' said McIntire,
whose great-grandfather, grandfather and father forged a living as fishermen
off Maine. 'I just hope that whatever happens, it will be fair.'

FT  27 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Phosphates aim for clean bill
of health
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Phosphates, thought to be environmentally criminal ingredients in
detergents, might get a reprieve if efforts to clear their name are
successful.
Initial concern about phosphates in detergents - which act primarily as a
water softener - dates back to the late 1960s when Lake Erie in the US
'bloomed' with an unusually strong growth of algae. Detergents were blamed.
Similar blooms now occur throughout the world and are part of a process
called eutrophication (rich in nutrients). These blooms have been blamed on
unusually high amounts of phosphates getting into rivers and lakes via
sewage systems and from farms.
The algae consume the oxygen in the water and deny it to other water life,
such as fish, which then die. Sometimes the algae rot and can be poisonous
if eaten by animals.
Most 'green' detergents exclude phosphates and declare this on the label.
The phosphates are replaced with higher levels of surfactants (the cleaning
agent) or alternatives are used.
Italy and Switzerland have banned phosphates from household detergents but
the UK government has called for more research before it makes up its mind
on the subject. In Stockholm, on the other hand, city authorities encourage
citizens to use detergents that contain phosphates.
At the heart of the argument is the EC's directive on municipal wastewater
treatment which should be implemented by 1998. This stipulates that sewage
works in areas suffering from eutrophication must install strippers to
remove most of the phosphates from the treated water.
Phosphate supporters argue that detergent-based phosphates contribute only a
small amount to the total quantity of phosphates in the water supply. Most
comes from agriculture and other constituents of sewage.
Furthermore, the substance is more efficient than alternatives. Zeolite, a
substitute, tends to form a sludge which can reduce the efficiency of sewage
works. If phosphates in sewage can be removed by stripping - and possibly
re-used as a fertiliser - then it makes sense to use the substance in
detergents.
This argument is backed by evidence which shows that phosphate bans in
Switzerland and Italy have not solved those countries' eutrophication
problems. The amount of detergent used in Switzerland has increased since
the phosphate ban because householders have used more to compensate for
reduced cleaning power.
Those who argue against phosphates say the EC directive will take nearly a
decade to be implemented and then strippers will only be sited in some
areas. They point to evidence gathered by the National Rivers Authority in
the UK which identifies eutrophication as a big problem in an area of
southern England which was previously unaffected.
There is no clear winner in the argument. The UK government commissioned a
report on the issue which concluded that there was insufficient evidence to
ban phosphates. The government then consulted industry and environment
groups and found little agreement on the issue.
It commissioned more research and allowed manufacturers to continue using
phosphates.
But environment groups have, for the most part, abandoned phosphates as a
campaign issue. Most of the confrontation on the subject is now taking place
within the industry.
Last year in France, for example, Rhone-Poulenc, a chemicals group, took
Henkel to court for promoting its phosphate-free detergent, Le Chat, as good
for the environment. The court found in Rhone-Poulenc's favour and fined
Henkel FFr150,000 (Pounds 15,000) for each infringement of the judgment.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Scotland gains a voice of its own in Brussels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BUXTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCOTLAND yesterday gained representation in Brussels when Mr Ian Lang, the
Scottish secretary, launched a body designed to help Scottish organisations
and businesses make the most of the European Community.
Scotland Europa is a hybrid - neither the embassy of an independent Scotland
nor the official representative office of a European region, but a
subsidiary of Scottish Enterprise, the official development body. It is a
joint venture between the public and private sectors and is expected to pay
its way from fees and rent within three years.
Although Scotland Europa houses representatives of Scottish Enterprise, the
main job of its chief executive - Mr Grant Baird, a canny 49-year-old who
was until recently chief economist of the Royal Bank of Scotland - is to act
for the members he signs up.
They include bodies such as Glasgow Chamber of Commerce, Edinburgh
University and the Scottish Trade Union Congress, and companies, of which
the first three to sign up are ScottishPower, Scottish Hydro-Electric and
Glasgow-based BP Exploration.
The organisation is the product of several years of argument about how
Scotland should best be represented in the EC without infringing the
prerogatives of the Foreign Office and arousing the anxieties of the
Treasury about costly duplication of facilities.
About 35 European regions already have offices in Brussels to keep abreast
of developments in the EC and lobby for their interests. The most
influential are said to be those of the German Lander, which report back to
the Land governments and legislatures.
The UK government decided that Scotland could not have a regional office
because of its status as part of the UK, which is a unitary state. Germany,
on the other hand, is a federation. The Scottish Office makes its
representations in Brussels through the UK's permanent representative office
in Brussels, UKREP, which is part of the Foreign Office.
Even Mr Bruce Millan, the former Labour Scottish MP who is the EC regional
development commissioner, said yesterday that this was the right way for
Scotland to deal with the Commission. He admitted, though, that he would
personally prefer Scotland to have its own devolved parliament and thus
separate representation in Brussels.
Some observers of regional activities in Brussels have warned that Scotland
Europa, because it lacks the status of an official government body in
Brussels, will lack influence when it tries to fulfil its aim of trying to
increase the flow of EC funds to Scotland.
Yet even before the setting up of Scotland Europa, whose creation follows
hard on the heels of Brussels offices for Northern Ireland and Wales, Scots
had been effective in obtaining EC funds. Strathclyde Regional Council,
Scotland's largest local authority, has had an office in Brussels for
several years and is at present coming towards the end of implementing a
Pounds 300m programme of regional aid.
The Highlands and Islands are dotted with European flags denoting EC-funded
projects.
The idea is that as Scotland Europa gains more members - it has about 20,
with a further 10 being courted - it will become the centre of a network of
intelligence on the likely effects for Scotland of what is going on in the
Community.
Members of Scotland Europa can purchase Mr Baird's time, depending on the
level of their subscriptions, to investigate new Commission proposals and
make representations about them. He admits that his agenda will largely be
dictated by his clients rather than following a predetermined strategy.
However, in one sense there is already a network of intelligence-gathering
on Scottish interests in Brussels.
Scotland Europa is handing out a booklet with the names, positions and
telephone numbers of all Scots known to be working in the Commission and the
Belgian capital. With cheerful allusions to the Mafia, it calls the network
Scotia Nostra.

FT  27 MAY 92 / A matter of striking a balance: The new trade minister
discusses his objectives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL andAND RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Richard Needham, the new trade minister, is anxious to deflect criticism
of Britain's export performance. He treads a balanced path between
reassuring businessmen worried by trade deficits and avoiding overt backing
for a more interventionist government policy.
After a month in his job, the new man at the Department of Trade and
Industry (DTI) is sufficiently astute not to criticise his predecessors but
believes that in promoting UK exports there has to be a more constructive
relationship between the DTI and industrialists. It would be churlish to
make too much of the fact that his predecessors made similar noises and made
light of the steady deterioration in relations with industry.
Yesterday Mr Needham faced top exporters concerned at the lack of support
and frustrated by the government's preference for seemingly endless bright
public-relations ploys - such as last September's export initiative to
Venezuela, or the Kuwait 'task force' aimed at winning business after the
Gulf war. Exporters would rather have help on export finance or the use of
more aid funds to boost exports.
Britain's export performance is not as bad as critics claim, Mr Needham
says. The long-term decline in Britain's share of world trade has
stabilised. The UK exports the equivalent of Pounds 1,800 a person a year.
Japan manages only Pounds 1,000.
The volume of UK exports has grown significantly faster in the last year
than many other leading industrial countries. 'That gives us a base on which
we can build,' he says.
When he was Ulster's economy minister he was regarded as interventionist, a
charge he does not deny, but he rejects any suggestion that he wants a
greater injection of public money into industry, talking instead of working
in 'partnership'. While his statements suffer from cliche, he does strive to
give them substance. 'What the DTI can do . . . in many parts of the world
is to work together with industry to ensure that if there are orders out
there, that they are got by us.'
Support should not just be forthcoming in officially sponsored export drives
but also when the DTI negotiates on the General Agreement on Tariffs and
Trade, within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development or
on the European single market, he says.
The government, he adds, should be seen to be backing winners and encourage
industry 'to feel that they have got that backing. That 'backing winners'
principle is going to be very important.'
He was unwilling to offer any pledges to increase the support that
government gives to exporters to sell goods in volatile or difficult
markets. UK industrialists complain regularly about the limited availability
of medium and long-term export-credit cover and the high cost of
export-credit insurance premiums, which they regard as unfair handicaps on
exports. Yet there is not even a hint that Mr Needham will try to meet their
complaints.
He is sympathetic, if uncompromising. 'Not everyone is going to get what
they want, but at least if you have a partnership and there is a large
degree of trust and confidence it is much easier, in those circumstances
when things don't always go right, to ride the squalls.' Such backing for
exporters extends to spending time on helping to restore the image of
industry and selling the idea of industrial benefits to young people.
'The last great exposition of British industrial might was in 1851 . . .
Ever since then, the whole atmosphere and attitude of the establishment
towards industry has declined, right through the education system, through
the Civil Service, through the professions and so on. Now I believe that
that is starting to come back.'

FT  27 MAY 92 / Needham issues pledge to exporters
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PROMISE of a fresh dialogue between the government and exporters about
how to improve the performance of British exports was made yesterday as a
six-strong delegation from the British Exporters' Association (Bexa) met Mr
Richard Needham, the trade minister.
Mr Needham agreed to meet the exporters in three months' time to update them
on what the government was doing and to hear their concerns.
The Department of Trade and Industry said the new minister found the meeting
'helpful and useful'.
Bexa said it believed that the dialogue would 'lead to a comprehensive
understanding of our mutual objectives in maintaining and developing the
international competitiveness of the UK export industry, for the overall
benefit of the country's economy'. The delegation was led by Mr Keith
Johnson, the chairman of its industry section.
The association said it had not previously had a dialogue with ministers.
Differences between exporters and the government were consistently
highlighted last year over the government's sale of the insurance services
group, the short-term credit insurance arm of the Export Credits Guarantee
Department.
More generally, exporters have expressed a view that the UK government is
not doing as much as its foreign counterparts to promote British exports.
Earlier this month, a memorandum from Bexa warning ministers of the risk
that the UK was turning into 'a screwdriver-assembly economy' was leaked to
the Labour party.
While just a general and introductory discussion, yesterday's meeting still
focused on export services provided by the government, including the role of
the continuing ECGD.
In the past few years, trade ministers have often committed themselves to
listening to, and working in partnership with, British industry, while in
practice relations have become progressively worse.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Government retreats on teacher training plans
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has partly retreated from controversial proposals to shift
secondary-level teacher training in England and Wales from training
institutions to schools.
Mr John Patten, education secretary, yesterday announced modifications to
plans by his predecessor, Mr Kenneth Clarke (now home secretary), to impose
a 20 per cent ceiling from September on the college-based component of
courses for the postgraduate certificate of education. The ceiling will
instead be a third, to be achieved by 1994.
That will raise the school-based component of courses from a current average
of 18 weeks to 24 weeks - out of the 36 weeks that the courses run.
Higher education institutions, and the government's Council for the
Accreditation of Teacher Education, expressed strong opposition to the
original plans. They feared that the move would undermine college education
departments and impose an excessive load on schools selected for training.
Mr Patten said: 'It is important to give trainee teachers as much
school-based training and experience as possible, without imposing
unnecessary burdens on heads and senior teachers.'
He added: 'In striking the balance at 24 weeks I believe that I am setting a
tough but fair requirement . . . I expect practising teachers to be more
fully involved in the design of courses and in the assessment of students
than they are at present.'
In a letter to Sir William Taylor, chairman of the accreditation council, Mr
Patten said the government would not be issuing guidelines on the amount of
money schools should receive from teacher-training institutions for their
contribution to courses.
Universities and polytechnics, which run most of the courses, warned of
widespread closures of education departments if they were forced to pass to
schools most of their income from training courses.
Mr David Hart, general secretary of the National Association of Head
Teachers yesterday accused the government of an incoherent approach to the
future organisation of schools.
He said ministers kept changing their minds on such key issues as selection
at the age of 11 or whether to allow mass opting-out of schools from council
control.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Old Masters hold their class: Saleroom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONY THORNCROFT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OLD MASTER pictures have survived the downturn in the art market better than
most sectors and both Sotheby's and Christie's held encouraging auctions in
New York at the weekend. Sotheby's was particularly cheered by a sale that
totalled Dollars 15.4m (Pounds 8.45m) with 13 per cent unsold.
The top price was Dollars 1.48m (Pounds 814,000) for a previously unknown
painting by Canaletto of Venice's Grand Canal looking south-west. To attract
bids in what is still a convalescent market, Sotheby's had put a temptingly
low estimate on the work of about Dollars 500,000.
The auction contained a group of paintings from the collection of Jaime
Ortiz-Patino including another Venetian view, of the Church of San Giorgio
Maggiore, by the other great 18th-century recorder of the city, Guardi,
which sold within forecast for Dollars 1.26m.
'A Village Wedding Dance', by Pieter Brueghel the Younger sold for Dollars
577,500 and another 'lost' painting, 'Boethius and Philosophy', by the
17th-century Italian artist Mattia Preti, which carried a Dollars 60,000
estimate, sold for Dollars 506,000. Sotheby's noticed stronger buying from
private American collectors.
All told, Sotheby's raised Dollars 29.4m for Mr Ortiz-Patino from its
auctions of furniture, silver and paintings from his collection. That
comfortably exceeded its pre-sale estimate of Dollars 22m.
Christie's main achievement in its Old Masters auction was selling all 31
paintings offloaded as surplus stock by the J. Paul Getty Museum in Malibu,
California. They totalled Dollars 3.33m. Top price in the sale was 'The
Bathers' by Francois Le Moyne, which had been estimated at Dollars 60,000
but which sold to a London dealer for Dollars 451,000.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Jaguar to introduce three-year warranties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN GRIFFITHS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAGUAR is preparing to sharpen competition in UK and continental European
luxury car markets by introducing three-year, 60,000-mile warranties from
June 1.
Such warranties have been standard since the mid 1980s on new cars sold by
Europe's prestige carmakers in the highly competitive North American market.
In Europe, the norm for BMW, Mercedes, Jaguar and other non-Japanese
prestige cars is a one-year, unlimited-mileage warranty, with some
manufacturers offering additional years at extra cost.
The decision to launch the extended warranty follows an intensive effort at
Jaguar, which is owned by Ford, to improve quality and productivity. Mr
Roger Putnam, sales and marketing director, said that the move would give
Jaguar 'an important advantage over our competitors' in the UK and on the
Continent.
BMW (GB) said last night that the company would be studying the move but
gave no indication that it might alter its own warranty terms.
Japanese manufacturers such as Toyota and Mitsubishi already offer two or
three-year warranties throughout Europe.
The warranty move comes as Jaguar has begun returning to a five-day working
week on its saloon car lines.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Violence sparks fears of summer rioting: The background to
clashes with the police in Coventry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE in Coventry are analysing extensive video footage and expect over the
next few days to make more arrests after a series of clashes with youths a
fortnight ago and over the three days of the holiday weekend. So far, 75
arrests have been made.
Outbreaks of violence in Coventry, involving the stoning of police, attacks
on fire engines, the use of petrol bombs, arson and stealing, have aroused
fears in the Midlands and elsewhere that UK cities may be poised for a
lawless summer.
Mr Robert Ainsworth, Labour MP for Coventry North-East, where some of the
disorder erupted, told the Commons in his maiden speech: 'Our cities are in
great danger.' Mr Robert Evans, chairman of British Gas, told a recent
Birmingham conference: 'Companies cannot afford to ignore the problems of
economic regeneration in their local communities.'
The Coventry areas where the clashes took place are quite different. Wood
End, scene of the first clash of youths with police, is an outer-city
council estate of low-rise homes, notorious locally for its decay in human
and physical terms.
Hillfields, where there was disorder last weekend, is an inner-city area
where the unemployment rates are the highest in Coventry and housing
conditions are described by the city council as 'the worst in the city'. The
two areas have poverty in common.
Although half the Hillfields population is black, neither of the series of
disturbances pitted one racial community against another. Rather, youths,
white in Wood End, both white and black in Hillfields, have been attacking
the symbols of authority. To that extent the outbreaks were similar,
although they do not seem to have been connected.
The gap in time between the series of incidents in Wood End and Hillfields
did not suggest that one series set off the other. The catalyst for the
disorder at Wood End is clear: the police made one of their periodic forays
to stop illegal motorcycle riding through the estate and met resistance.
At Hillfields, there was no clear reason for the outbreak, although recently
the police have been acting against drugs and prostitution and therefore
might be said to have been attacking local vested interests.
In both cases the delicacy of the police position was clear. The police had
to be seen to be acting against local lawbreaking, if only to dissipate
pressures from residents to set up their own vigilante groups. Once
attacked, the police, from their own point of view, had to react: there
could not be a no-go area where the police writ did not run.
If the police came down too hard, though, there was the chance that the
antagonism of the youths - gangs of up to 40 in Hillfields and more than
double that number in Wood End - would be exacerbated, thus storing up
trouble for other warm nights.
For the moment the question of authority seems to be resolved. In Hillfields
yesterday police patrolling was normal and in Wood End the motorcycling
terrorism has abated. Yet the question of why the authority should be
contested, why the youths are so antagonistic, remains.
Mostly the youths are unemployed or truants. There is an established
coincidence between lawlessness on the one hand and unemployment and
deprivation on the other.
A Coventry City Council report on Wood End last year noted high levels of
family breakdown, of child neglect and of debt. More recently the council
has stated that in Hillfields, a district which has suffered 'substantial
economic decline' and where there is 'limited access to jobs and higher
education', the crime levels 'are among the highest in the city'.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Education programme at Ford improves industrial relations
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
AN EDUCATION programme at Ford has significantly improved industrial
relations at the motor company, according to senior managers and union
leaders.
Mr Jack Adams, deputy general secretary of the TGWU general union and the
senior Ford negotiator, said the Education and Development Assistance
Programme (EDAP) had been responsible for keeping last year's pay talks to
one day - the first time this had happened for many years. Last year was
also the first year in which no strike threat was made.
EDAP, in which Ford pays up to Pounds 200 a year for each employee's
after-work education, is run by local committees on which union and
management representatives have an equal say. In the magazine of the
Involvement and Participation Association, Mr Adams says union-management
co-operation on the project had caused 'suspicions on both sides to
diminish'. EDAP, which was set up in 1988, allows employees to study any
subjects except those which have a direct bearing on their jobs.
Mr John Hougham, Ford's personnel director, told the magazine: 'We have had
experience of working together, of learning together, of co-ownership, of
joint acceptance of responsibility, of actually sharing an enormous
enthusiasm for what we are achieving.'
A report by the Ruskin College Trade Union Research Unit emphasises that
EDAP has not only improved union-management relations but also the relations
between employees themselves.
It adds that the company will benefit from easier recruitment and retention
and concludes that EDAP is a model of what 'social partnership' could
achieve.

FT  27 MAY 92 / DoE predicts a sharp fall in spending on training
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART, Labour Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   GOVERNMENT spending on the country's two largest training schemes
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Youth Training and Employment Training - will fall sharply in real terms in
1993-94, according to internal Department of Employment estimates.
The cut, partly for demographic reasons, is expected and follows similar
cuts over the past two years. YT is likely to be cut from Pounds 851m in
1992-93 to Pounds 845m in Pounds 1993-94 and ET, for unemployed adults, will
rise slightly in nominal terms, from Pounds 807m to Pounds 818m, but not
enough to cover inflation.
The leaders of the 104 Training and Enterprise Councils, which administer YT
and ET in England and Wales and spearhead the government's training
initiative, will try to resist the cuts in the spending discussions with the
Treasury and the Department of Employment which begin next month.
The Tecs' main priority is to win greater flexibility for the way they spend
their money. They want more money to be based on 'outputs' - the number of
people who achieve specified qualifications, or jobs - rather than 'inputs',
the number of people who start courses. People currently finishing ET
courses have little more chance of finding a job than people who do not do
ET at all.
Lord Stockton, chairman of Centec in central London and unofficial spokesman
for Tec leaders, said Tecs wanted freedom to offer ET training to people who
have been unemployed for only three months, instead of the current threshold
of six months.
Tecs also want more flexibility on the length of courses, arguing that some
people need shorter but higher-quality courses and others longer but
lower-level. 'Inflexibility has exacerbated the funding problem,' Lord
Stockton said.
Tecs are keen to divert as much money as possible from big training schemes
for the unemployed to the demanding Investors in People training standard
for people already at work. The government is also keen to push Investors in
People but will not allow Tecs to abandon the guarantee of a training place
for all people under the age of 25.
Some London Tecs have still not agreed their budgets with the Department of
Employment for the current year but are expected to do so in the next few
weeks.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Talks venue adds Pounds 5m to EC presidency cost
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN's six-month presidency of the European Community, starting on July
1, will cost up to Pounds 5.5m more as a result of the decision to hold the
Heads of Government summit in Edinburgh rather than in London.
The Foreign Office said yesterday that the meeting will cost Pounds 6.4
million to stage in Edinburgh, compared with an initial estimate of Pounds
900,000 for holding it in London. However, the Foreign Office added that
even had the summit stayed in the capital that figure would have been
higher.
The decision by Mr John Major, the prime minister, to hold the EC leaders'
summit in Edinburgh was taken in the run-up to the general election with the
aim of reinforcing his adherence to the Union with Scotland.
A large part of the extra cost for staging the meeting in the Scottish
capital will come from renovating Holyroodhouse, where the talks will be
held.
The cost of different locations has been taken into account by the Foreign
Office in deciding on venues for the other council meetings and informal
talks, all of which are expected to be held in London.
A further Pounds 3.4 million has been set aside to cover the costs of the
six-month presidency.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Little sign of revival in house lending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE IS little sign of a revival in the housing market, according to
lending figures produced by the Building Societies Association, Philip
Coggan writes.
Although evidence from estate agents had suggested that confidence in the
housing market had improved since the general election, the April lending
figures, which included three post-election weeks, were lower than those for
March.
Mr Mark Boleat, director general of the Building Societies Association,
said: 'The fall back indicates that buyer confidence has not yet been fully
restored to the housing market. There is evidence that the general election
had a temporary depressing effect on activity.'
On the savings side, the building societies had net receipts of Pounds 212m
last month, after an outflow of Pounds 172m in March. Mr Boleat said those
figures were 'relatively low' for a month that was usually favourable for
building societies. The April inflow last year was Pounds 1.337bn.
Gross mortgage lending was Pounds 2.988bn, Pounds 133m lower than in March
and down from Pounds 3.308bn in April 1991. Net new commitments were Pounds
2.764bn, compared with Pounds 3.456bn in March and Pounds 3.530bn in April
1991.
Mr John Wriglesworth, building societies analyst at stockbroker UBS Phillips
&amp; Drew, said the savings figures were 'terrible', adding that 'it looks as
though 1992 is going to be the year for societies to struggle to get retail
receipts'. He added that he had evidence to suggest the market had picked up
in May.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Leader of Names attacks militants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR PETER NUTTING, a prominent Names' leader and a member of Lloyd's Council,
the insurance market's governing body, yesterday launched a ferocious attack
on more militant Names' leaders.
Mr Nutting, who earlier this year led a successful campaign for compensation
by nearly 1,000 Outhwaite Names, resigned his chairmanship of the Lloyd's
Names Association's Working Party on Friday.
He said: 'It is becoming increasingly apparent that some leaders and members
of the committees of some action groups are involved in a highly organised
and well orchestrated campaign of vilification against Lloyd's, its council
and most of those who earn their living on the market.'
Mr Nutting is particularly critical of legal efforts by Names - individuals
whose assets back underwriting - that are designed to win injunctions to
prevent Lloyd's drawing down their deposits in order to pay insurance
losses. He said such action 'strikes at the foundations of Lloyd's'.
Although UK Names have so far been unsuccessful in two separate efforts to
win injunctions, an American Name was granted an injunction by a Denver
court last week.
The Lloyd's Names Association Working party has been involved in discussions
with Lloyd's about a bail-out scheme to help Names facing severe
underwriting losses.
However, it has not been supported by the biggest Names association, the
Gooda Walker Names Action Group, which has more than 2,100 members.
The Gooda Walker Names' chairman, Mr Alfred Doll-Steinberg, is backing
another effort to win injunctions for his Names and has been critical of Mr
Nutting's more moderate approach. Mr Nutting also says that action groups
should postpone any action until the Lloyd's reviews are complete. Mr
Nutting said: 'I believe a number of action groups would be well-advised not
to confuse activity with action which is in most cases premature and in some
cases counter-productive. I strongly urge all members of action groups to
reject the leadership of extremists.'

FT  27 MAY 92 / Ulster talks stalled by infighting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and Our Belfast Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROWS between Northern Ireland's Unionist and nationalist leaders last night
appeared to have seriously - perhaps fatally - undermined the government's
four-week-old attempt to resolve the province's political future by
dialogue.
In spite of a series of meetings with local political leaders during the
day, Sir Patrick Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, seems to have failed to
reach agreement on when to move to the next stage of the agreed talks
schedule - the point at which the Irish government would take part.
Instead, a sub-committee has been set up to try to resolve the dispute.
The delay - which in effect means losing a week out of the 12 set aside for
talks - and the apparent anger of Unionist and nationalist leaders, suggests
that the initiative may not get any further.
Nobody will want to be seen as the first to walk away from the negotiating
table, however.
The talks have concentrated on finding agreement on a devolved government in
the province. The nationalist and Unionist positions have been so far apart,
however, that little common ground appears to have been agreed.
'Strand two' of the talks - on relations between north and south - was
supposed to start at Sir Patrick's discretion but 'within weeks' and once
'substantial progress' had been made.
The two requirements have proved mutually exclusive.
Negotiations on issues rather than procedure have lasted far longer this
year than during a similar initiative last year, and the participants have
largely maintained the promised confidentiality - a sign that some goodwill
remains.
Mr John Hume, leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party,
urged a swift move to strand two while Mr James Molyneaux and the Rev Ian
Paisley, the two unionist leaders, want to stay at strand one.
Unionists have been horrified by SDLP proposals for a government in the
province that would include commissioners appointed by the Dublin government
and the European Community.
The army was at the centre of fresh ill-treatment allegations yesterday
after a clash with civilians in Londonderry.
Police and army investigations have been launched into an incident in the
republican Shantallow area on Monday.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Cadbury Schweppes to move its headquarters
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
CADBURY Schweppes, the confectionery and soft drinks maker, is to move its
group headquarters to Berkeley Square in London's Mayfair.
The letting of a 51,500 sq ft building, reportedly at Pounds 55 a sq ft, is
thought to be the most valuable deal signed in the West End since the
property market went into steep decline in late 1990.
'The demand for good buildings has definitely come back in the West End,'
said Mr Geoff Marsh of Applied Property Research, a research group. Several
potential tenants were looking for property in the area as a result of a
revival of confidence after the general election and a feeling that rents
would not fall any further, he said. He did not expect other parts of London
to see a similar revival.
Cadbury has signed a 25-year lease for the newly refurbished building in the
north-east corner of Berkeley Square. At present, the company is based in
Connaught Place, west London. The Berkeley Square building belongs to
Randsworth Trust, a subsidiary of Randsworth Acquisition, which went into

an asking rent of Pounds 70 per sq ft, for about a year.

cent for the area.

FT  27 MAY 92 / London office glut worsens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPTY OFFICE space in central London increased by 5 per cent in the first
quarter of this year to stand at 34.2m sq ft - enough to fill London's
Centre Point tower 190 times over.
The proportion of empty offices in the capital now totals 18 per cent,
according to Debenham Tewson &amp; Chinnocks, property advisers. That record
availability figure is largely responsible for the severe decline in central
London property values since 1990.
Debenham Tewson believes that the rise in vacant property over the past two
years is coming to an end. It said: 'Availability will fluctuate about its
current level until the end of the year, when it will start to fall
gradually.'
The rise in availability was inclusion of large developments at Ludgate in
the City and East India Dock in Docklands, which together contributed more
than 800,000 sq ft of space.
Recovery is being hampered by the low level of demand. The rate of take-up
in the first quarter of this year was the same as last year, with about 2m
sq ft of offices let. Media companies and government departments were the
most important sources of demand.
Debenham Tewson expects the low level of demand to continue because it
believes office employment in central London will fall in the short term.
It expects the amount of new offices becoming available to vary between 3m
sq ft and 4m sq ft a quarter for the rest of the year. That is a sharp
reduction from the levels of 1990 and last year, when the quarterly average
was about 7m sq ft. Construction starts in the first quarter of this year
were just less than 500,000 sq ft, one of the lowest quarterly levels since
1986.
The report highlights the poor quality of much of the available space. It
says that older, second-hand buildings in fringe locations may be converted
for residential uses.
'Given the poor prognosis for central London office employment over the
foreseeable future, there will be growing pressure to identify alternative
uses for apparently unlettable offices,' the report adds.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Pounds 1m gems in BCCI dispute
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE depositors with Bank of Credit and Commerce International attempt to
increase their compensation from Abu Dhabi, a fresh legal battle has started
in London - over the fate of jewels belonging to Mrs Rabia Abedi, wife of
the bank's former president.
The tug-of-war over the collection of diamonds, emeralds and South Sea
Island pearls, valued at almost Pounds 1m, started yesterday at City of
London magistrates' court but must now go to the High Court for a
resolution.
The gems, seized by police last year and displayed in court, include a pair
of gold earrings, each inset with 16 Indian rose-cut diamonds, with
nine-diamond pendants and three-pearl tassels.
The police seized them as part of the Serious Fraud Office investigation
into the collapsed bank and were yesterday asking for a court order over who
should maintain possession of the collection.
They were supported by lawyers for Touche Ross, the official liquidators,
who argued that they had a claim on the jewels since Mr Agha Abedi, the
former BCCI president, had purchased them with the bank's money.
The liquidator's counsel told the court that both the Abedis were now
resident in Pakistan. Should the jewels be allowed out of UK jurisdiction,
they might never return.
Counsel for Mrs Abedi said the police had seized the collection illegally.
Mrs Abedi had issued a writ against the SFO for their return and proceedings
would start in the High Court, he said, arguing successfully for the
magistrates' court proceedings to be adjourned indefinitely.
Detective Superintendent Jerry Ohlsen of the City fraud squad said an order
was necessary because of the cost to the City police of keeping the jewels
in a Barclays Bank vault. The police had decided that, in the circumstances,
their own vault was too insecure.

<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Fernando Collor de Mello of Brazil yesterday apologised to the
nation for the crisis caused by allegations of corruption and drug abuse
levelled against him by his younger brother.
In a nationwide television and radio address Mr Collor said he was
apologising for the 'outcry caused by the insensitive and false declarations
of my brother Pedro'. Appearing pale and tense, he said: 'I've come to the
conclusion that, however painful it may be for me and my family, I cannot
leave the country without answers, without knowing the truth. As president
my personal feelings must be sacrificed because Brazil comes above all.'
The Brazilian Congress was still voting yesterday evening on whether to open
a parliamentary inquiry into the accusations against Mr Collor and Mr Paulo
Cesar Farias, the businessman whom Mr Pedro Collor alleges operates as the
president's 'front-man'.
The Democratic Movement party (PMDB), Brazil's largest party, announced it
would vote in favour of such a probe. An inquiry could delay consideration
of important economic projects.
The financial markets continued to fall yesterday morning, with the main Sao
Paulo exchange dropping 5.5 per cent after a poll by the Folha de Sao Paulo
newspaper showed that a majority believes the accusations. Of those polled,
43 per cent called for the president's dismissal. The latest inflation
indices also suggested that inflation is heating up and is expected to reach
22.5 per cent this month.
However, by lunchtime the markets seemed to have calmed, encouraged by the
president ruling out the possibility of resigning or impeachment and by his
apparent decision to move on to the offensive by launching a police inquiry
and legal proceedings against his brother for 'moral damage'.
After the afternoon recovery the Sao Paulo index ended the day just 0.3 per
cent down.
The attorney-general has called on Mr Pedro Collor to present immediate
proof of his allegations and to hand over a video tape on which he
elaborates the charges.

<TEXT>
US biotechnology companies will not need special approval to market food
products they develop, as long as they do not drastically alter the genetic
make-up of the food, the White House said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Washington.
The policy proclamation decrees that genetically engineered foods - emerging
strains ranging from tomatoes to cucumbers and melons - are not inherently
more dangerous than other products and do not need extensive pre-marketing
tests. The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates most US foods, will
not require identifying labels on genetically altered products under the new
policy.
The policy decision was expected and fiercely opposed by some consumer
watchdogs, on health and safety grounds. But the White House rejected their
fears that fruits and vegetables genetically altered to produce tastier,
more nutritious or longer-lived produce might be dangerous.
Under the policy the FDA will require pre-market testing only if products
are altered in such a way that safety issues are raised. One example might
be if a new product was unlike anything that had been safety-tested before.

MR Ross Perot will step down next week as chairman and chief executive of
Perot Systems, clearing his way for an independent run at the US presidency.
A formal declaration is expected later next month.
Mr Morton Meyerson, a business associate, will take over the corporate
offices of the computer services company which had revenues of about Dollars
200m (Pounds 112.9m) last year. Mr Perot will remain on the board.
The Texas businessman has so far contributed about Dollars 1.25m to finance
his prospective campaign, including Dollars 850,000 in April alone. He has
said he is willing to spend more than Dollars 100m.
So far his supporters have officially registered him on the presidential
ballot in only seven states, with five more due later this week. But there
seems little doubt that petitions on his behalf will get him on all 50
states, plus the District of Columbia. He had made this a pre-condition for
running for president.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
STRONGER than expected figures for US consumer confidence and car sales
yesterday indicated that the uncertain economic recovery is becoming more
firmly established.
The signs of stronger domestic growth, together with fears of higher oil
prices, contributed to a sharp fall in bond prices on Wall Street.
The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its
closely-followed index of consumer confidence rose to 71.6 this month,
against 65.1 in April and a low of 47.3 in February.
Sales of domestically made cars jumped to a seasonally-adjusted annual rate
of 6.7m in the middle of the month, compared with analysts' forecasts of
sales of 6m. Sales were running at an annual rate of only 5.7m in the first
10 days of May.
Sales of light trucks also rose sharply, to an annual rate of 4.9m against
3.7m at the start of the month.
Car sales are seen as a key barometer of public confidence. The failure of
sales to revive earlier in the year was one of the main reasons for fears of
an unusually weak recovery.
The increase in consumer confidence was also larger than expected. However,
the index remains well short of the 100 plus level normal in a healthy
recovery.
Mr Fabian Linden, for the board, said the improved figures left 'little
doubt that the economy is at long last recovering'. The Federal Reserve
reached the same conclusion last week when it decided against further
interest rate cuts. For the first time since August the Fed reportedly
shifted to a neutral monetary stance, abandoning its bias towards lower
short-term rates.
More than a quarter of respondents to the Conference Board survey said they
expected improved business conditions over the next six months, against less
than 10 per cent expecting worse conditions.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Courts and cash tax limits of the power of prayer: Problems
of strategy and finance inthe Christian Science church
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRISTIAN Science reading rooms are usually calm, quiet places befitting a
religion that emphasises the power of prayer. But beneath the surface, the
Boston-based First Church of Christ, Scientist has been riven by a debate
over strategy, finances and leadership.
At the centre of the US-based religion's problems has been an ambitious
attempt - now partly abandoned - to build a miniature media empire. The
effort, started in the 1980s, has cost dearly and dented the church's
finances. Distressed at this and the manner in which those finances were
being handled, some senior figures resigned earlier this year. They included
John Hoagland, one of the principal forces behind the media expansion, who
stepped down as one of three trustees of the Christian Science Publishing
Society.
Since then an uneasy lull has descended and the external spotlight on the
church's affairs has dimmed. But, with three events scheduled to take place
over the next month, it seems unlikely that matters will stay subdued.
For a start, lawyers will appear in a probate court today, attempting to
assert the church's right to a Dollars 98m (Pounds 55.3m) bequest against
competing claims from the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Stanford
University.
Meanwhile, the First Church of Christ, Scientist - known to Christian
Scientists as the 'Mother Church' - is preparing a comprehensive report on
its finances. This should reach members by the annual meeting on June 8.
And there is still the vexed question of what the Christian Science movement
does with its 'Monitor Channel', the US cable operation which caused many of
its financial difficulties in the first place. A deadline of June 15 has
been set for its sale, and if a buyer cannot be found the operation will
close.
This all represents unwelcome publicity for a movement founded by Mary Baker
Eddy, then Mrs Patterson, in 1866. The 45-year-old New Englander, who lived
near Lynn in Massachusetts, suffered bad internal injuries after a fall. She
attributed her subsequent recovery to the invocation of divine power through
prayer, and spent the rest of her life spreading a gospel of Christian
healing.
The church itself was formed in 1879. However, its early years were marked
by organisational upheavals, and what emerged was a structure which differed
significantly from that of other organised forms of Christianity. Today,
most Christian Scientists have dual membership, both to a local
democratically-run 'branch' church, and to the Mother Church, governed by a
'self-perpetuating' board of directors.
The religion has long been active in the publishing world - starting with
The Christian Science Journal, which Mary Baker Eddy founded in 1883.
However, for most of this century its flagship operation has been the
Christian Science Monitor, a respected daily newspaper with strong
international coverage and a predominantly secular approach. Reputation
notwithstanding, the Monitor has been the victim of falling circulation
recently. It sells 108,000 copies a day, a third down on a decade ago.
It was in the mid-1980s that the Mother Church started to build up a broader
range of media operations. It began to produce TV and radio news programmes,
acquired a TV station in Boston, and started to transmit shortwave radio
broadcasts worldwide. The most ambitious project, however, was the Monitor
Channel, a 24-hour news and current events channel. This began to air in
early 1991 and, at one stage, employed several hundred people.
These wide-ranging media operations required substantial subsidies from the
church. Detailed estimates of the losses have varied substantially, but it
is generally acknowledged that the aggregate annual deficits ran into tens
of millions of dollars.
That, in turn, has prompted much internal debate about the expansion
strategy. Some Christian Scientists have viewed this as a justified
extension of the church's activities. Others have argued that the effort was
diverting the religion from its core principles, at worrying cost.
In the event, financial outlays and the growing dissension put an end to the
ideological debate. The church, having borrowed money from its pension fund
to back the Monitor Channel, announced on March 9 that it would shed the
operation. Today church officials say that efforts to find a buyer are
continuing and note that representatives were out in force at a big trade
show recently. However, if a new owner is not secured by June 15 they are
emphatic that the channel, already reduced to minimal technical staff, will
simply shut down.
This complex interplay of finance and ideology has not been confined to the
media expansion. Earlier this century a heavy-going book, The Destiny of the
Mother Church, was written by a Mr Bliss Knapp. Like his parents, Mr Knapp
was a prominent member of the Mother Church, and the book was published
privately in 1947. The Mother Church regarded the work as ideologically
suspect and declined to treat it as 'authorised' literature.
But, under a bequest set out before his death by Mr Knapp and his immediate
relatives, the church stood to receive millions if it reversed this policy
by 1993. Late last year it did indeed decide to make the book available in
print through the Christian Science Publishing Society. It now sells in
reading rooms for Dollars 15.
Whatever the real motivation for this change of heart, some Christian
Scientists have had misgivings, suspecting that the Mother Church was
abandoning principles for the sake of money.
In fact, the funds have not been forthcoming immediately. The two
alternative beneficiaries, the Los Angeles County Museum of Art and Stanford
University, are still seeking to determine whether the Knapp bequest
conditions have been met by the Mother Church.
And there, in uneasy fashion, matters stand. 'We put a lot of stock in the
power of prayer,' comments one church member, trying to explain that the
very secular spotlight which has been turned on the church misreads the more
spiritual approach of the membership to the church's difficulties.

<TEXT>
EGYPT yesterday called on the US, Russia and the United Nations to press
Israel to end the air strikes on guerrilla targets in south Lebanon which
continued yesterday and which have sharply raised tensions in the region
over the past week.
In an unusually strong statement, the Egyptian Foreign Ministry condemned
what it called Israel's 'flagrant aggression' against Lebanon and called on
it to 'desist immediately'.
It said the UN and the two sponsors of the Middle East peace negotiations -
the US and Russia - should intervene with Israel to prevent any damage to
the peace process.
Shortly after the Egyptian statement Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN
secretary general, expressed concern that the escalation of violence could
jeopardise Middle East peace efforts. He deplored the loss of innocent life
and urged restraint.
Egypt, the only Arab country to have made peace with Israel, is worried that
the violence in south Lebanon could escalate out of control. Fears have been
expressed of a clash between Syria and Israel, although Israeli leaders
yesterday signalled that they did not expect such an outcome.
Israel launched repeated rocket strikes yesterday morning on positions held
by Hizbollah, the Iranian-backed Moslem fundamentalist militia fighting
Israel's occupation of a 'security zone' inside Lebanon. Four guerrillas and
one civilian were wounded.
It was the third wave of air attacks carried out by Israeli forces since a
Hizbollah force last week overran a post held by the South Lebanon Army,
Israel's surrogate militia, which polices the zone.
In one attack on a Hizbollah leader's house, his wife and two small
daughters were killed.
The attacks included strikes on positions in areas under Syrian control.
Syria was reported to have boosted its troop concentrations in Lebanon after
the attacks and its foreign minister, Mr Farouk al-Sharaa, said Syria would
have 'no option but to fight' if Israel 'imposed war'.

JAPAN last year regained its position as the world's largest holder of net
foreign assets, despite the turmoil in Tokyo's financial markets.
Japan's net overseas assets rose 16.8 per cent to a record Dollars 383.1bn
(Pounds 216.40bn) at the end of 1991, overtaking Germany's total of Dollars
345.4bn, according to figures published yesterday by the Ministry of
Finance. Japan held the top spot for five years from 1985, before losing it
to Germany in 1990.
Economists said the figures highlighted Japan's continuing ability to invest
abroad, even though some of its financial institutions have been hit by the
slump in the Japanese stock and property markets.
The balance of Japan's gross short-term investments overseas declined
slightly - by 0.4 per cent to Dollars 759bn - because of cuts in financial
market investments by Japanese banks. Banks have been reducing foreign
assets to try to meet standards for capital adequacy set by the Bank for
International Settlements.
However, the balance of gross long-term investments rose 13.8 per cent to
Dollars 1,247.9bn, thanks to continuing investments in foreign securities,
in direct investment such as factories, and in loans made under Official
Development Aid (ODA) programmes. Taking short- and long-term investments,
Japan increased its total gross foreign assets by 8.0 per cent to Dollars
2,006.5bn.
Foreigners' investment in Japan also grew, with the balance of gross inward
investment rising 6.1 per cent to Dollars 1,623.4bn. Foreigners' long-term
investments soared 39.5 per cent to Dollars 647.4bn, as investors poured
funds into Japanese stocks and bonds, hoping to take advantage of the slump
in the Japanese equity market. Foreigners' holdings of Japanese securities
rose 32.7 per cent.
Foreigners' short-term assets declined by 8.4 per cent to Dollars 976.0bn,
as investors switched funds from short-term instruments, such as
yen-denominated bank deposits, into equities.
The disparity in flows of direct investments increased once again - with an
increase of Dollars 30.3bn, Japan's total direct investments rose to Dollars
231.8bn. Foreigners investments in Japan rose a modest Dollars 2.4bn to
Dollars 12.3bn.
Japan's June long-term prime rate has been increased by 0.3 points to 6.3
per cent, Reuter reports from Tokyo. The long-term credit banks and the
Ministry of Finance were divided over what the June long-term prime rate
should be.
Bank officials said they wanted to raise the rate by 0.3 percentage points
in line with the yield on the latest five-year bank debentures, while the
MoF said it was opposed to a 0.3 point increase on concerns about its
possible negative impact on the economy.
The increase was the first in 11 months. The rate was last raised by 0.2
points to 7.9 per cent in July 1991.

The treaty gave the go-ahead to development of the Markham Field, operated
by a Dutch subsidiary of Lasmo, the UK oil exploration and production
company. The field, with reserves of 700 bn cubic feet, straddles the
UK/Netherlands median line, requiring inter-governmental agreement on the
development plan, allocation of reserves, and issues such as safety and
inspection, before the field could be developed.
Gas will be exported from the North Sea field via a pipeline to Den Helder,
in the Netherlands. The majority will be sold to Gasunie in the Netherlands,
with the rest going to Wintershall in Germany.

president, urged the Swedish government to ease its current trade
restrictions with China which were imposed after the Tiananmen Square
massacre nearly three years ago.
The company itself has arranged the financing of the deal because Sweden's
public aid credit body - Bits - has not been allowed to provide the kind of
credits that were needed.
Mr Ulf Dinkelspiel, the Swedish trade minister, said yesterday that the
government was considering whether to ease the existing restrictions but he
could give no timetable of when they were likely to be abolished.
The new deal for the Guangdong mobile telephone network will be implemented
during the first quarter of next year, Ericsson said.
The original installation began in 1988 and covers 95,000 subscribers.

FT  27 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Honda announces first motorcycle venture
in China - The Japanese company's willingness to commit capital to the joint
venture company is a measure of its confidence in the Chinese market
</HEADLINE>

HONDA Motor of Japan yesterday announced that it would establish the first
motorcycle production joint venture in China, which is quickly becoming one
of the world's most lucrative motorcycle markets.
The Honda announcement of a joint venture in Guangzhou, in the south, is
likely to be followed by a similar project by Yamaha Motor, which at present
is negotiating the terms of a production venture with Chinese government
organisations.
Honda already has technical assistance projects with Chinese partners in
four cities, but its willingness to commit capital to the Dollars 17.6m
(Pounds 9.7m) joint venture company, Wuyang-Honda Motors (Guangzhou), is a
measure of its confidence in the Chinese market.
The Japanese company will have a 35 per cent stake in the project, with
state-run Guangzhou Motorcycle taking the majority stake. Honda will also
have three representatives on an eight-member board.
Using an existing factory, the joint venture company expects to produce
50,000 motorcycles of 125cc engine capacity in the first year, and plans to
double the output by 1995.
Production will begin in August and the new company will have 1,500
employees.
The exact number of motorcycles in China is unclear, but the Japanese
industry estimates that there were 1.8m units sold last year and that the
total number is around 7m. Sales in 1990 are reckoned to have been between
1.1m and 1.2m.
Honda's technical assistance projects, which began operations in 1982,
produced about 224,000 bikes last year, and the total this year, including
the new joint venture, will be about 330,000. This is expected to rise to
some 500,000 by 1995.
'The market is booming at the moment, so we don't plan to use the new
factory for exports,' a Honda official said.
However, a shift in political winds could hurt the motorcycle market, as the
Communist Party limited sales after crushing the pro-democracy movement in
1989.
The party was apparently annoyed that motorcyclists played an active role in
the demonstrations and police were ordered to confiscate riders' licences.

<TEXT>
WHEN Haris Silajdzic, the indefatigable foreign minister of
Bosnia-Hercegovina, arrived in Washington last month, he had one aim: to
jolt the US out of its indifference towards the violence and ethnic fighting
in his country.
For nearly a year, the US has relied on the European Community to shoulder
the burden of the war in the former republics of Yugoslavia. The tall and
dapper Mr Silajdzic, 47, has changed all that.
'James Baker (US secretary of state) agreed to meet Silajdzic,' a US state
department official said. 'Baker had already been briefed many times by
Larry Eagleburger, and Brent Scowcroft, both of whom were diplomats in
Belgrade in the 1960s and had close connections with Serbian President
Slobodan Milosevic. Silajdzic had a lot of work to do, a lot of records to
put straight. . . . Baker didn't know what hit him last month.'
The official said Mr Silajdzic spelt out to the secretary of state how
Serbia was trying to destabilise Bosnia's newly-won independence, and how
both Croatia and Serbia were conniving to divide Bosnia.
His sensitivity towards ethnic problems and the dangers they bring was
fostered during his university days at Pristina, the capital of the province
of Kosovo, whose ethnic Albanian majority has long been in conflict with its
Serbian overlords. Before his appointment to the foreign ministry in 1990,
Mr Silajdzic was an academic in Sarajevo. His speciality is international
relations.
'Silajdzic impressed upon Baker that this was no local war in a far away
place. He argued that the Balkans could go up in flames, involving Greece
and Turkey, two Nato allies,' another US official said.
Mr Silajdzic returned to Washington 10 days ago, with considerable
difficulty. Serb irregulars and the Yugoslav federal army have been allowing
no one in, or out of, Sarajevo airport.
Capitalising on his growing friendship with Mr Baker, the Bosnian foreign
minister then started swinging the American media behind him. His articulate
manner, helped by his impeccable English which he learned while doing a
doctorate in the US, put Bosnia-Hercegovina and its Moslems on the map.
He has also won much support among the tens of thousands of Moslem refugees
who have sought refuge in neighbouring Croatia. 'He is a kind man, and a
great man,' said Mr Shefko Cengic, a 32-year-old refugee from Sarajevo.
'Let's hope American support is backed by deeds as well.'

<TEXT>
MR John Major announced the abolition of UK visa requirements for Polish
tourists yesterday and increased Britain's financial aid to Warsaw. The
gesture was designed to underline his commitment to Poland's eventual
membership of the European Community.
After talks with Polish leaders in Warsaw, Mr Major said he would use
Britain's presidency of the EC in the second half of this year to commit the
Twelve to allowing Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary to join the Community.
He said membership of the EC was not practical in the short term. Poland is
locked in twin political and economic crises, heightened last night when
President Lech Walesa declared he had 'lost trust in the present
government'. All three countries are still making a painful transition to
market economies.
Mr Major, however, emphasised his determination that the Community should
not remain a 'rich man's club', suggesting that the EC should set the turn
of the century as a firm target for their inclusion.
His announcement, after talks with Mr Walesa and Mr Jan Olszewski, the
Polish prime minister, that Britain will abolish visa requirements for
Polish visitors to the UK ended a long-running dispute between the two
governments. In the past Britain has argued that, because of the large
Polish communities in the UK, many visitors have stayed on as illegal
workers.
Some 200,000 Poles live in the UK. Many have relatives in Poland who want to
visit. Complaints have centred on long delays in granting visas, excessive
bureaucracy, the number of people rejected and the charge for visas, which
at about Pounds 20 can be more than a week's wage in Poland. Last year
47,350 Poles applied for UK visas, and 5 per cent were turned down.
The announcement was welcomed by Polish community organisations in the UK.
Mr Mieczyslaw Hampel, administrator of the Polish Social and Cultural
Association in London, said: 'In general we are very pleased'.
Mr Major said the UK would increase financial aid for Poland by Dollars 14m
(Pounds 7.7m). The money will finance small business development.
Ariane Genillard in Prague writes: Mr Vaclav Havel, the Czechoslovak
president, will urge the EC to speed the process of admitting east European
countries when he meets Mr Major today. Faster integration with the EC would
lessen the risk of violence in the east, he said.

INDICATIONS of a sharp recovery in the French economy in the first quarter
of this year have been warmly welcomed by Mr Michel Sapin, the finance
minister, who has predicted that this year's growth rate may well exceed the
2 per cent previously forecast by the government, writes Ian Davidson in

French GDP grew by 1 per cent in the first quarter of this year, according
to official figures, and by 2.8 per cent on a year-on-year basis, twice as
fast over this period as the rest of the industrialised world.
Exports provided the main motor of the recovery, expanding by 4.3 per cent
in the first quarter or by 9.7 per cent against last year's opening period.
Household consumption has been more hesitant, with an increase of 0.7 per
cent during the quarter.
The black spot remains corporate investment, which dropped for the sixth
quarter in a row, this time by 0.6 per cent.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Waigel says no to Emu subsidies

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S finance minister, Mr Theo Waigel, rejected suggestions yesterday
that European Community members should be subsidised to help them meet the
economic targets set as a condition for taking part in European monetary
union (Emu).
He also promised to set a good example of the necessary self-discipline when
he tables his own budget on July 1.
'Member states need constant pressure from the convergence criteria in order
for them to make the necessary adjustments at home,' the minister told a
conference in Frankfurt.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said it would be prudent
for a future European central bank to set monetary goals and minimum reserve
requirements for banks.
Mr Waigel said there was no mention of a convergence fund in the Maastricht
treaty, which established the ground rules for economic, monetary and
political union by the end of the decade. Subsidies to help poorer members
meet the criteria could be counter-productive.
He had already proposed his measures for controlling Germany's rising
deficits, and gave assurances that his budget package for 1993 would be no
more than 2.5 per cent higher than that for 1992.
Mr Waigel will today discover how much help he can expect in his
much-vaunted 'hard-as-nails' budget policy at a meeting between leaders of
the ruling coalition and the opposition Social Democrats.
The main aim of the talks, which follow further setbacks for the mainstream
parties in elections in Berlin at the weekend, is to reach an understanding
on financing economic recovery in the east.
Meanwhile, the Bundesbank stood by its own strict criteria. Mr Otto Issing,
the central bank's chief economist, said there would be no change in its
money supply growth targets, which come up for review this summer.
Revision would undermine the bank's credibility and arouse 'mistrust', he
told a Bundesbank seminar.
He acknowledged the rapid expansion of the broad M3 measure, up 8.8 per cent
in the first four months of this year compared with the bank's target
corridor of 3.5-5.5 per cent. The Bundesbank had to bring them closer into
line, he said.
Even so, he added, the target was only a 'rough guide' and in the past had
been met only around 50 per cent of the time.
However, according to Mr Hans Tietmeyer, the bank's vice-president,
expansion of the money stock and the current 'far too high' rate of
inflation ruled out any interest rate reductions 'in the foreseeable
future'.
Speaking in Singapore on Monday night, he said an inflation rate of 2 per
cent must again become the benchmark for the next few years. Recent pay
deals of around 6 per cent were still not satisfactory in terms of
anti-inflation policy, although Mr Waigel's plans for controlling public
spending were the correct course.
Inflation during May is expected to be steady at around 4.5 per cent on an
annual basis.
A drop to below 4 per cent is widely expected in July, when excise duty
increases imposed last summer drop out of the reckoning.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Banks asked to provide Pounds 500m for Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKERS to Canary Wharf are being asked to provide another Pounds 500m loan
facility to keep the project owned by Olympia &amp; York Developments out of the
hands of the receivers and to build the Jubilee Line Underground extension
to Docklands.
This is far more than the banks originally hoped they would have to provide.
However, bankers said yesterday they were cautiously optimistic that the
loan package would be approved.
The 11 banks, which include Citibank of the US, Canadian Imperial Bank of
Commerce, Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Credit Lyonnais of France, Royal
Bank of Canada, and Barclays and Lloyds of the UK, are reconciled to
honouring O&amp;Y's agreement with the UK government to provide Pounds 400m
towards the costs of extending the Jubilee Line.
On the other hand, they are counting on the government to rent 500,000
square feet of office space at Canary Wharf for more than 2,000 civil
servants. 'We need the government to sign up for the space at the same time
as we sign the loan agreement', said a banker.
Bankers have been persuaded by the government that it cannot subsidise the
project by taking the space at an uneconomic rent. However, they believe the
Pounds 15 a square foot price being offered is a commercial rate.
The government's negotiations with the banks are being co-ordinated, on
behalf of the prime minister, by Lord Wakeham, the Lord Privy Seal. A banker
involved in the negotiations admitted the Canary Wharf lenders faced
sizeable losses on the loans they had already made to the project. 'But
there is a good chance that over a 10-year period we might recoup some of
those losses if Canary Wharf is kept afloat', he said.
To date, banks have provided a core loan of Pounds 566m to Canary Wharf and
a finance lease of Pounds 58m. There is also a separate Pounds 450m loan
from four Canadian banks and Pounds 100m from the European Investment Bank.
The 11 bank creditors must at the very least agree to provide Canary Wharf
with an additional interim loan facility of Pounds 20m by the end of the
week if the company is to avoid filing for insolvency protection in the UK.
Their plan would be to approve the full Pounds 500m by mid-June.
The Pounds 500m has two elements:
Pounds 300m is needed to furnish the buildings, provide inducements to
potential tenants, complete the small amount of construction work
outstanding on phases 1 and 2 of the project and pay the Pounds 100m first
two tranches of O&amp;Y's contribution to the costs of building the Jubilee
Underground line.
Another Pounds 200m is required to meet interest payments to banks on
existing loans. However, the banks will try to find outside investors who
would refinance individual Canary Wharf properties. If they succeed, the
Pounds 200m facility would still be needed as a guarantee to these outside
investors that their interest will be paid.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Disposal of Mountleigh UK property may take years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, ROBERT PESTON and PAUL CHEESERIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DISPOSAL of Mountleigh's Pounds 400m UK property portfolio could take
years, according to KPMG Peat Marwick, the receiver appointed on Monday.
Mr Stephen James of KPMG said he had already received interest from
potential purchasers. But he stressed that there would be no immediate 'fire
sales'. 'It may take years to unravel,' he said.
Receivers were also appointed yesterday to 21 UK subsidiaries.
As the complexity of repaying Mountleigh's creditors became clear, bankers
warned that other property companies were likely to collapse in coming
months. 'The worst may be yet to come in the UK property market', said a
senior banker with loans outstanding to Mountleigh.
Mountleigh has two main borrowing facilities. A syndicate of nine banks,
whose agent is Barclays, has provided Pounds 329m. Also in the syndicate are
Credit Suisse of Switzerland, Citibank and Bankers Trust of the US, Unibank
of Denmark, Credit Lyonnais of France and three UK banks, Royal Bank of
Scotland, National Westminster and Lloyds.
There is a much smaller Pounds 38m syndicated loan, whose agent is Citibank.
There are also two overdraft facilities, taking Mountleigh's total bank
borrowings to more than Pounds 400m. In addition, it owes bondholders Pounds
144m.
Mr James said it would take several days to decide what should be done with
the UK property portfolio. Although the property is generally well-let, it
includes several development sites.
The largest properties in Mountleigh's UK portfolio are the Merry Hill
shopping centre at Dudley in the West Midlands, the Camberley shopping
centre in Surrey and a half share in the Criterion centre in London's
Piccadilly Circus.
The Richardson brothers, who developed Merry Hill and sold a controlling
interest in it to Mountleigh, said they might be interested in repurchasing
the shopping centre. Mr Don Richardson said: 'If we could get some
arrangement on price we couldn't let a good deal pass by.'

FT  27 MAY 92 / Trade gap widest since 1990: April imports surge prompts
fears over whether recovery can be sustained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S trade and current account deficits widened unexpectedly last
month, pointing to increased activity in the domestic economy but casting
doubts over whether the recovery can be sustained.
The visible trade deficit jumped from Pounds 891m in March to a seasonally
adjusted Pounds 1.36bn in April, the highest since August 1990.
The Central Statistical Office estimated that the deficit on current
account, which includes a projected Pounds 300m surplus from 'invisible'
trade such as services and transfers, increased last month to Pounds 1.06bn,
the biggest since January last year, from Pounds 591m in March.
Imports, when measured in volume terms and minus oil and so-called erratic
items such as aircraft, ships, oil rigs and precious stones, set a new
record in April. While some economists said the jump in imports was a
welcome sign of recovery, others expressed concern that import volumes had
already recouped the recession-linked decline before any real recovery in
the economy had become apparent.
Yesterday's figures cast some doubt on the UK's ability to maintain strong
economic growth in the medium term without experiencing the constraints of a
widening trade deficit. 'The figures bode ill for the sustainability of the
recovery,' said Mr Leo Doyle, an economist with Kleinwort Benson, the UK
merchant bank and securities group.
At the Treasury, however, a spokesman pointed out that some pick-up in
imports was to be expected as the economy recovered. He said exports were
still strong and warned that monthly trade figures could be erratic.
The April deficits were much higher than the City's consensus forecasts of
Pounds 600m for the current account and Pounds 900m for the visible trade
account. They reflected a sharp 3.5 per cent increase in the value of
imports to Pounds 10.15bn last month. Exports, at Pounds 8.79bn in April,
were 1.4 per cent lower than in March. However, exports, although down last
month, have been running at a historically high level. The volumes for both
exports and imports in the latest three months are the highest ever
recorded.
The deficits had a mixed impact on financial markets. Shares were marked
down on the news and continued lower partly because of falling prices on
Wall Street. The FTSE-100 index, up 12.1 points before the announcement,
closed at 2,704.6, down 10.4.
Sterling, protected by relatively high interest rates and membership of the
European exchange rate mechanism, shrugged off the bad news and gained
against both the D-Mark and dollar. At the London close, the Bank of
England's trade weighted sterling index was 93.1, up 0.3 on Friday's close,
while the pound closed 0.5 pfennigs higher at DM2.9425 and up 1.35 cents at
Dollars 1.828. In New York, the pound closed at Dollars 1.825 and stood at
DM2.94225 in late trading.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Yale chief quits to build US schools for profit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE PRESIDENT of Yale University, Mr Benno Schmidt, is resigning to lead a
controversial project aimed at revitalising US education by building a
national network of profit-making private schools.
Mr Schmidt, a 50-year-old law scholar, is to become president and chief
executive of the Edison Project, the brainchild of Mr Christopher Whittle, a
Tennessee entrepreneur best known for his Channel One TV news programme
beamed to classrooms.
The project plans to break the mould of US education by creating 1,000
technologically advanced schools offering pre-school to high school
education. Mr Whittle hopes to open 100 of the schools by 1996 and the rest
by 2010.
It aims to rethink the assumptions behind conventional schooling - from the
length of the school day to classroom teaching methods.
The Whittle schools hope to capitalise on deep-seated worries about the
quality of America's state schools. A series of recent tests has shown US
students languishing at the bottom of international league tables in
subjects such as maths and science.
The schools plan to charge fees of about Dollars 5,500 (Pounds 3,000) a
year, roughly the average cost per child in the state school system. They
expect to generate healthy profits by using fewer teachers and support staff
than public schools and by making better use of new technology.
About a fifth of pupils at the schools would be needy students funded by
scholarships.
The project has initial financing of Dollars 60m from a consortium including
Whittle Communications, Mr Whittle's company, Time-Warner, Philips
Electronics and Associated Newspapers of the UK.
The Edison Project closely parallels the Bush administration's 'America
2000' initiative, which is financing pilot projects to design a new breed of
public schools.
Mr Schmidt will head a design team that includes Mr Chester Finn, a former
top aide at the Department of Education, and Mr John Chubb, a fellow at the
Brookings Institution and co- author of Politics, Markets and America's
Schools, an influential book that made a powerful case for more competition
and parental choice in US education.
Mr Schmidt's surprise departure was the latest of several recent blows for
Yale, which has lost two other senior officials in recent months. It
recently announced controversial plans to close several academic departments
in an effort to curb a Dollars 12m budget deficit.

FT  27 MAY 92 / AT&amp;T to pay Russians Dollars 60 a month
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AMERICAN Telephone &amp; Tele - graph hired 100 fibre optics scientists and
technicians from the Russian Academy of Sciences in Moscow yesterday at the
bargain salary of Dollars 60 (Pounds 34) a month per scientist.
The one-year renewable contract, which begins next Monday, puts AT&amp;T among
the first US companies to have found a way of using the wealth of talent
left behind in the break-up of the Soviet Union.
Corning, the glass company, also yesterday announced it had signed joint
research accords that would employ more than 100 Russian scientists on basic
research projects in glass. It is understood to be paying the scientists
about the same salary as AT&amp;T.
The scientists working with Corning will research silicate, phosphate and
fluoride glass, as well as conducting research into optical materials and
devices.
The AT&amp;T deal calls for the Russian team to work full-time in Moscow, under
subcontract, in co-operation with the 100-strong fibre optics team in the US
of Bell Laboratories, its research centre.
Bell said the deal was worth 'a few hundred thousand dollars', and would
include funds for travel by the Russian scientists to the US on brief
visits. Bell will provide funds to the Russian Academy's General Physics
Institute to buy equipment for the research projects, which are expected to
focus on developing high-strength fibres and metallic coatings on optic
fibres.
Dr Kumar Patel, executive director of Bell Laboratories, said the equipment
to be supplied, including some laser systems that are a generation old,
would not violate any Cocom restrictions on the export to Russia of
sophisticated US technology. 'At present there is no intention of
transferring the latest fibre optics technology to Russia,' Dr Patel
explained.
Fibre optics has become a crucial telecommunications technology, rapidly
replacing copper cabling as the medium of choice for high-speed digital
transmissions, ranging from telephone to computer systems.
The deal includes an unusual intellectual property rights agreement. This
will allow the Russian institute to retain patent rights within Russia for
any products developed during the research, while Bell Laboratories has the
patent rights for the rest of the world. In March, Sun Microsystems of
California enlisted a team of 50 former Soviet defence researchers to work
on supercomputer applications.
They are believed to be getting even lower pay than the AT&amp;T subcontractors.
The US administration itself recently finalised a contract with 116 nuclear
scientists at the Kurchatov Institute of Atomic Energy in Moscow to help in
the development of develop a fusion reactor. These scientists are believed
to be receiving around about Dollars 65 a month.

FT  27 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures And Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DULL day in stock index futures saw the June contract drift lower in
afternoon trading as an aimless market looked to a weak Wall Street as its
focus, writes Christopher Price.
June opened at 2,733, and an initially lively start saw the contract
squeezed up, reaching 2,744 by 10.30am. However, this proved to be the high
point of the day, as interest drifted away. Although it still managed to
trade at a slight premium to fair value for the rest of the session, the
story was mundane as June slid with the cash market. The poor UK trade
figures added to the negative tone.
A declining Wall Street, pressured by faltering US bond prices, further
undermined June. The contract ended at 2,713, down a net 26, and around its
estimated fair value. Turnover reached 6,361 contracts. However, in
after-hours' trading, June was under further pressure, slipping to an
estimated two-point discount to fair value.
Among traded options, turnover was boosted ahead of expiry day for a number
of series. Lasmo was the top stock option, with 3,378 contracts dealt and
the August 240 series particularly busy. Hanson and Cadbury-Schweppes which
also expire today were also busy. Total turnover was 28,923 lots compared
with 26,595 on Friday.

FT  27 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Northern consolidation after
recent uptrend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SLIGHT weakness, or consolidation after recent gains ruled in northern
Europe yesterday, but Milan and Madrid both managed to close higher, writes
Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT settled for a moderate consolidation, the DAX index closing 4.91
lower at 1,806.66 after a 0.25 rise to 725.26 in the FAZ at midsession.
Volume fell slightly from DM7.7bn to DM7.6bn.
The more broadly based FAZ index, which has lagged behind the blue chip DAX
during the market's recent rally, actually hit a new 1992 high yesterday.
Not all of its constituents were so lucky.
Lufthansa, the airline which produced poor results earlier this month, hit a
new low of DM126.50, down DM5.50 yesterday compared with a 1992 high of
DM181.50. In a similar, but less severely disappointing category, the
engineer, Deutsche Babcock, dropped DM3.70 to DM163.
Generally, pre-bourse optimism generated by a slowdown in inflation in the
state of Hesse failed to result in follow-up buying orders; and Hesse's fall
from an inflation rate of 4.5 per cent in April to 4.1 per cent in May was
countered later by Baden-Wurttemberg, where the rate rose from 4.3 to 4.4
per cent.
Nevertheless, there was more confidence about economic recovery prospects
and an eventual fall in interest rates; utility companies, interest rate
sensitive, bucked the weaker trend with RWE rising DM3.70 to DM413.20.
In engineering MAN rose another DM7 to DM397 on good prospects for the
current year and, in banking, Bayernhypo rose DM5 to DM412.50 on what was
conventionally put down to good first quarter results; Ms Barbara Altmann,
of B Metzler in Frankfurt, said the figures were in the price and that
financial technicians were buying the shares for the dividend about to be
paid.
PARIS seemed to be slightly unnerved by the capital increases announced by
Bouygues yesterday and Alcatel Cable on Monday, with Lafarge Coppee rumoured
to be in line for a FFr5bn issue in the near future. As a result the CAC-40
index lost 16.67 to 2,029.58 in turnover of some FFr2.34bn.
Bouygues, FFr13 off at FFr632, was also reported as saying that negotiations
between Eurotunnel and its contractors were deadlocked which could threaten
the survival of the project. Eurotunnel was 50 centimes weaker at FFr37.85.
Alcatel Alsthom, parent of Alcatel Cable, lost FFr9 to FFr649 on news of its
subsidiary's capital increase; Lafarge shed FFr6.60 to FFr374.40.
However, one of the biggest losses on the day was recorded by LVMH as the
market reacted to Monday's news that the outlook for 1992 was not promising.
Its shares closed down FFr110 or 2.6 per cent to FFr4,085 with some analysts
saying that 1992 earnings will have to be downgraded.
Oil stocks continued to buck the market with Elf up FFr1.50 at FFr398.40 and
Total rising FFr5.30 to FFr267.80.
MILAN extended its rally to a fourth session, the Comit index closing 1.56
higher at 497.25 following the election of Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro as
president on Monday. Volume was estimated at around Monday's L113bn.
Industrials tried to take the initiative again, but largely failed to do so.
Fiat closed L59 higher at L5,394 but slipped to L5,355 on the kerb.
AMSTERDAM weakened slightly in late trading and the CBS Tendency index
closed down 0.1 at 130.9.
Royal Dutch saw strong foreign interest, gaining Fl 4.20 to Fl 158.60.
Elsewhere Nedlloyd, which holds its annual meeting today, was 50 cents
weaker at Fl 60.50, Buehrmann-Tetterode suffered from profit-taking and shed
Fl 1.10 to Fl 52.40 and Elsevier lost Fl 1.70 to Fl 113.50.
Hunter Douglas, which announced that it is to begin trading in London, was
up Fl 1.90 at Fl 74.20, while Fokker lost 50 cents to Fl 34.80 as Deutsche
Aerospace said that it hoped to complete its acquisition of a 51 per cent
stake by mid-June.
STOCKHOLM was cautious ahead of the Electrolux first-quarter results, which
arrived after the close. The Affarsvarlden General index fell 6.7 to 991.1,
with turnover moderate at SKr434m.
Electrolux, the white goods major, saw its B shares lose SKr4 to SKr283
ahead of profits which were about 10 per cent below expectations. The real
loser of the day was the banking and finance sector, which fell by 3.6 per
cent; analysts said that the decline was due more to program trading than
any new discouraging news.
MADRID was held up by Telefonica's surprise news, after Monday's close, that
it would lift its 1991 dividend to Pta59 from Pta55. Its shares closed up
Pta25 at Pta1,165 while the general index put on 0.20 to 258.90 in low
volume of some Pta5.8bn.

FT  27 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei falls 1.9 per
cent after bleak earnings reports
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENTIMENT deteriorated yesterday after bleak earnings reports, and share
prices lost ground on small-lot profit-taking and index-linked selling,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average ended 350.36, or 1.9 per cent, down at 18,204.64. It had
opened at the day's high of 18,519.67, falling to a low of 18,203.53 in the
afternoon.
Volume picked up a little from 189m shares to 200m. Dealers remained on the
sidelines on the final trading day for May delivery, while most investors
waited for corporate results. Mr Kaoru Shimura at Sumitomo Life, a leading
life insurer, said current price levels were too high to buy, but too low
for profit-taking.
Declines led advances by 581 to 342, with 193 issues unchanged. The Topix
index of all first section stocks slipped 11.87 to 1,371.83, but in London
the ISE/Nikkei 50 index edged up 0.96 to 1,085.16.
Towards the close, the Nikkei's downswing was accelerated by selling
pressure in the futures market, which prompted arbitrage-unwinding. Traders
said market participants have started to become cautious towards next
month's expiry of the June futures. Mr Richard Clayton at County NatWest
said low liquidity in the September contract could affect the rolling over
of arbitrage positions.
Speculative theme stocks remained firm, with Morinaga Milk Industry, the
most active issue of the day, rising Y8 to Y860. Okamoto Industries advanced
Y40 to Y1,390.
Trust banks, which announced weak results for the past fiscal year,
retreated. Pre-tax profits at the seven trust banks fell by 34 per cent, due
to thinner profit margins and sharp falls in commission revenues. Some trust
banks announced cuts in dividends, and investors have become wary of their
deteriorating loan portfolios. Mitsui Trust &amp; Banking fell Y31 to Y830.
Nippon Telegraph and Telephone receded Y9,000 to Y633,000. The company
posted a 15 per cent decline in unconsolidated pre-tax profits for the last
fiscal year, and forecast that profits will drop 24 per cent to Y267bn for
the current year to March 1993.
Electronics issues, which have reported sluggish earnings with some
companies expecting a slow recovery, lost ground. Sharp, which expects a 7
per cent decline in pre-tax profits for the current year, fell Y70 to
Y1,260.
In Osaka, the OSE average dipped 44.98 to 20,911.50 in volume of 12.7m
shares. Small-lot profit-taking amid low volume depressed share prices.
Nintendo lost Y200 to Y10,800.
Roundup
MARKET rumours lifted Hong Kong and Singapore yesterday in a mixed day for
the region.
HONG KONG broke through 6,000 and stayed there this time, hitting a third
record high in four days as the Hang Seng index rose 58.97 to 6,052.08.
Turnover was again strong, totalling HKDollars 5.7bn after Monday's record
HKDollars 6.4bn.
One stimulus was the rumour that Hong Kong Land, the colony's premier
landlord, had sold one of its office buildings in the central business
district for a price above market value. The company declined to comment but
the stock rose 40 cents to HKDollars 13.30, and its parent, Jardine
Matheson, gained HKDollars 2 to HKDollars 59.50.
SINGAPORE was subject to widespread rumours that interest rates may be
lowered by another 0.25 of a percentage point, and the Straits Times
Industrial index closed 23.34, or 1.6 per cent, higher at 1,494.29 as
turnover jumped from SDollars 70m to SDollars 159m.
Traders were surprised by the strength of the market, which grew in
intensity towards the last hour. This prompted the belief that buying came
from UK funds.
MANILA rose as the market looked forward to the likely victory of former
defence secretary Mr Fidel Ramos in the presidential elections which took
place on May ll.
The composite index added 8.07 at 1,440.91 after Monday's 53-point climb.
BANGKOK fell as investors waited for a new coalition government to take
shape following the resignation as prime minister of Mr Suchinda Kraprayoon.
The SET index relinquished 12.84, or 1.7 per cent, to 729.58 in moderate
turnover of Bt3.9bn.
TAIWAN lost ground after midsession when selling pressure was triggered by
falls in many of the small, speculatively oriented shares which had played a
leading role in the market's recent rally.
The weighted index dropped 94.33, or 2 per cent, to 4,540.00.
AUSTRALIA's All Ordinaries index dipped 9.9 to 1,674.2 in turnover of
ADollars 158m, compared with Monday's ADollars 143m. Brokers said investors
were waiting for today's ANZ Banking half-year results.
BOMBAY had a dull day. After the scandals which have rocked Indian equity
markets recently, a lack of initiative yesterday was reflected in a fall in
the BSE index of 106.55 to 3,298.74. Volume was described as poor, with only
limited institutional interest.

FT  27 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Hope ascendant in bullish Hong Kong
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN PITT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
With hopes of an interest rate cut pushing the Dow to a record level, and
the pay settlement by metalworkers and employers in Germany sending the DAX
to a 21-month high, sentiment was generally bullish last week and the
FT-Actuaries World Index gained more than 1 per cent.
All was not well everywhere, Finland registering the steepest fall in the
index. Insurers and banks were the main casualties. Helsinki has been fairly
erratic since the stamp duty tax on share transactions was removed at the
start of the month, and after a flurry of interest the market has retreated
into lethargy.
However, Kleinwort Benson's latest monthly review says there should be a
further stimulus once all foreign ownership restrictions are removed,
possibly by the autumn.
Other Scandinavian markets, with the exception of Denmark ahead of next
month's referendum on the Maastricht treaty, had a good week. In particular,
Sweden is looking strong, with Astra active last week on a better than
expected first quarter.
Elsewhere in Europe, Italy recovered, the Comit index rising by nearly 3 per
cent on Thursday following Fiat's announcement of a Dollars 2bn joint
venture with FSM, the Polish car maker. The market should get another
short-term boost once the political impasse has been resolved; this is now a
little nearer after Monday's election of a new president.
Looking to Asia, Hong Kong stood out as the star performer, in spite of
beginning the week in negative territory as the Olympia &amp; York troubles led
to selling of property issues. However, traders soon put this behind them as
hopes of a further easing in interest rates, fulfilled on Friday, pushed the
Hang Seng index to new highs.
The percentage point cut in the prime rate surprised the market, and
analysts had no hesitation in forecasting that the index will soar.

London COCOA prices continued to decline, second position July sinking to a
new 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 546 before closing at Pounds 547 a tonne.
Dealers said there was no sign of significant producer selling.
Manufacturers were also inactive. A quiet week appears in prospect with a
French holiday tomorrow likely to limit business further. In contrast
robusta COFFEE closed around the day's highs, also in quiet trading. Prices
were aided by a lack of sellers. Caution was evident ahead of this week's
producer meetings at the ICO, starting today, and there was little sign of
any Indonesian selling. New York arabicas were ahead at midday. On the LME
NICKEL moved ahead; the close was considered constructive by technical
traders, signalling further gains today. COPPER again met resistance on any
rise to the Dollars 2,240 level for three-month metal, dampening trading
interest. In Chicago WHEAT held modest gains at midday, supported by news of
crop damage in western Kansas because of record cold there during the US
Memorial Day weekend. Also bullish was news that Russia bought a large share
of soft red winter wheat in its total purchase of 860,000 tonnes of EEP
wheat.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Farmer's Viewpoint - From
farmyard to fuel tank / Agriculture could become a driving force for
industry and transport
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS LONG ago as 1912 the man who invented the 20th century's most economic
motor engine, Rudolph Diesel, said: 'The use of vegetable oils (as fuel) may
be negligible today but such products could very well become as important as
mineral oil and coal tar products'. The concept of using farm crops as a
source of motive power is therefore hardly new.
Indeed in Mr Diesel's day, in spite of his inventions, most transport was
based on genuine live horsepower and the animals derived their energy from
hay and oats. So perhaps it was easier for him to conceive of a similar
source of power for his engines than it is for the present generation more
used to relying on non-renewable fossil fuels.
The question is, why are we still using up precious reserves of crude oil
when we could be running our tractors, lorries and cars on fuel derived from
crops grown afresh every year on farms? Moreover, if we were using such
low-carbon fuels the level of air pollution would be much reduced and both
the environment and human health would benefit.
The reason, of course, is the relative cost. As a rough rule of thumb it
would be necessary for the price of oil to rise by a factor of three or,
alternatively for the price of farm based fuels produced from EC-grown crops
to come down by two thirds, for the relative costs of the two products to
correspond.
Clearly oil is too cheap and the cost of growing non food crops too high for
the environmentally attractive idea to be viable. No one would wish to see
the price of oil rise by the necessary amount for fear or provoking world
recession, And farmers could not afford to grow the appropriate crops at
such a reduced return.
But times may be changing. Last week's Brussels agreement on reform of the
European Community's common agricultural policy, for instance, will mean
that the prices farmers get for crops like cereals, oil seed rape and in due
course, sugar beet, will be much closer to world levels, in other words,
lower. The fact that there will be compensation for the loss of income
should be viewed separately. The relevant point is that it will be cheaper
for industry, or whoever, to buy crops from farmers and this will narrow the
gap between them and fossil fuels.
A few weeks ago the EC proposed and the UK government accepted that a carbon
tax, designed to encourage consumers to use the fuels that cause the least
air pollution, should be imposed to raise the cost of the fossil fuels
mainly responsible for the problem. The proposal has not yet been endorsed
by community environment ministers, but the delay appears to be only
technical and to do with drafting. Assuming that this is the case, while the
speed of introduction and the initial extent of this tax remains to be
determined, it is likely to become EC policy and over time will raise the
price of fossil fuels.
Meanwhile it has also been agreed that the levels of excise duty charged on
so-called 'bio-fuels' , that is those derived from vegetable sources, should
be limited across the community to 10 per cent of those charged on the
fossil fuels they replace.
Add all these measures together and it is clear that the cost gap which
existed only weeks ago is now much smaller, always accepting of course that
this is the result of political manipulation rather than market forces. It
might not be too fanciful to believe, however, that the environment and
green policies in general will continue to receive favourable treatment by
governments for the foreseeable future.
The community would not be treading a new path if it developed a bio-fuel
industry. In fossil fuel-starved Austria for instance such an initiative is
already well advanced. Farmers grow oil seed rape and sell it at government
subsidised price to processors who convert it into fuel for tractors and
lorries and then sell it back to them.
The performance of the vegetable-powered vehicles is said to be only
marginally lower than it would be with fossil-based diesel and the
conversion from one to the other can be done in any farm workshop. How much
the success of this venture relies on aid from the Austrian government is
not immediately clear but lack of other sources of fuel was clearly the
motivation and at least it has proved it can be done.
Neither is diesel fuel the only one that can be replaced from farm based
sources. In Brazil, another country without its own fossil fuel resources,
many of the country's cars run on fuel derived from alcohol made from sugar
cane. It can also be made from maize or wheat starch and during the 1970s
oil crisis US fuel companies set up plants to manufacture what they called
'gasahol'. Now that the oil price has fallen it is seldom seen but the
technology exists and given a favourable cost comparison could be
reactivated.
Moreover there are many other as yet unexploited industrial uses for farm
crops. It is well known that it is possible to manufacture plastic from
wheat starch. What is more the product is bio-degradable, making it
environmentally desirable.
Disposable nappies made from farm based starch are already being widely used
in the US as are engine fuel filters and absorbent gels. They too have
superior environmental properties compared with fossil based equivalents and
after use need not be buried in landfill sites but can be composted and
returned to the soil as an organic fertiliser.
There is even a type of printer's ink made in the US from soya bean oil.
Presumably it enables journalists to eat their words if the need arises.
Could it be that non-food uses of farm crops is an idea whose time has come?
Will the combination of global environmental concern and the realisation
that reserves of fossil fuels are finite persuade governments to take the
extra step, now shorter than ever before, to make such enterprises viable?
Certainly it will have to happen sometime - when the oil runs out. It would
be potentially disastrous if the present concern about surplus food
production that prevails in the EC were to blind politicians to the
opportunities that could be provided by efficient, cheap, renewable crop
production.

fire
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S OIL industry watchdog yesterday ordered the closure of the big
North Sea Ekofisk oil and gas complex pending clarification of the cause of
a brief fire which broke out on Monday night in an air filter on one of the
field's platforms.
'We have informed Phillips Petroleum that oil and gas production from the
Ekofisk complex will have to be shut down until we have a reasonable
explanation for the cause of the fire. Phillips will have to formally apply
to the directorate to reopen production from the field,' explained Mr Jan
Hagland, an NPD official.
The field produces about 250,000 barrels of crude a day, but three nearby
fields - Valhall, Gyda and Ula - which produce a combined 330,000 b/d will
also be affected as their output is transported by pipeline to the Ekofisk
field centre.
Also affected by the closure is about 1bn cubic feet of gas per day which is
transported from the Ekofisk complex to Emden, Germany to supply a
consortium of European gas buyers. Mr Hagland said that a team of NPD
experts is assisting Phillips in seeking to determine the cause of the fire.
The fire occurred just hours ahead of an earlier planned maintenance
shutdown by Phillips in which Ekofisk production would have been shut down
for approximately 90 hours. Mr Hagland said that if the Ekofisk closure was
maintained over an extended period it could have implications for production
from the giant Statfjord and Gullfaks fields, which have combined oil output
of just over 1m barrels a day.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Producers plan palm oil defence
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
INDONESIA AND Malaysia are to meet next month to discuss setting an
international standard for crude palm oil. The Philippines has also been
asked to attend the discussions, which are in response to concerns over the
high-cholesterol content of palm-oil.
An official of the Indonesian Palm Oil Producers Association said yesterday
the meeting would set a minimum standard for crude palm oil exports and was
needed 'to counter the allegation' over high cholesterol levels.
Indonesia has achieved dramatic growth in palm oil production from about
700,000 tonnes in 1980 to an estimated 2.9m tonnes last year. Exports have
risen rapidly from just 300,000 tonnes in 1980 to about 1.46m tonnes in
1990, itself a 50 per cent increase over the previous year.
A recent report by the US embassy in Jakarta estimates that 715,000 hectares
were harvested during 1990, but that a further 400,000 hectares had been
planted 'ensuring steady gains in production in coming years'. Industry
officials say a further 100,000 to 150,000 hectares is being planted every
year.
Industry officials estimate production of 3.2m tonnes this year, rising to
up to 3.7m tonnes in 1993 and 4.9m tonnes by the end of the decade.
Indonesia exports of palm oil and kernel totalled USDollars 329m last year,
up from Dollars 216m the year before. The Netherlands accounts for about
one-third of exports, while other important buyers include China, Kenya and
the UK.
Palm oil demand will exceed supply for the second consecutive season in
1991-92 (October-September), despite steadily increasing production,
according to the Oil World newsletter, reports Reuter from Hamburg.
World production is expected to rise by 740,000 tonnes to 11.94m tonnes in
1991-92 but usage will jump 1.12m tonnes to 12.33m tonnes.

development, will be a local area network for launching new futures and
future-options or listing low-volume products.
Mr William O'Connor, the exchange's chairman, said: 'Ferrous scrap futures
are just the sort of market Project A is meant for'.
The ferrous futures contract will for 100 tonnes of either shredded or
bundled scrap and will have the trade months of March June, September and
December.
The minimum price movement will be 25 cents a tonne or Dollars 25 a
contract. The daily limit on price movements will be set at Dollars 10 a
tonne. Delivery against the contract will be made on the basis of tendering
shipping certificates issued by scrap processors and approved by the
exchange.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Demand for Latin American
debt intensifies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and AP-DJ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is little sign of slowing in the Latin American debt market, with new
borrowers queueing to tap international investors for funds and bankers
introducing new structures to investors thirsty for high-yielding
investments.
Last week, Uruguay became the latest Latin American sovereign borrower to
tap the international bond market, following Mexico, Venezuela and
Argentina. It raised Dollars 100m over three years in a deal lead-managed by
JP Morgan.
Next in line is probably Columbia. Bankers said yesterday the country was
also hoping to raise Dollars 100m, and was in talks with new issue firms.
Most expected a bond issue of between three-years and five-years maturity,
priced to yield between 2.75 per cent and 3.25 per cent more than US
Treasury bonds. Uruguay's issue was priced at the bottom end of this range.
However, while Latin American countries are still obliged to pay
substantially more than most European or US corporations, the cost of funds
has fallen sharply since the market re-opened to them in late 1990.
For example, Nafinsa, the Mexican state financing agency, borrowed at a
yield spread of 350 basis points over Treasuries in 1990, but today would
pay closer to 220 basis points. At the same time, dollar interest rates have
fallen sharply.
As yield spreads on straight Latin American bonds have fallen, bankers are
designing new structures offering investors higher-yielding, but potentially
more risky, investments.
For example, Credit Suisse First Boston yesterday launched a Dollars 75m
two-year bond issue backed by a holding of Venezuelan debt conversion bonds,
securities issued as part of the country's Brady debt restructuring
agreement with commercial bank creditors.
Although similar private placements have taken place, the deal is the first
public Eurobond issue collateralised on Latin American debt.
The deal offers a high return, with a yield spread of 370 basis points over
US Treasury bonds. Bankers said yesterday a new two-year Eurobond issue by
Venezuela would offer a yield spread of perhaps 200 basis points.
However the high return reflects a higher risk. The cash to repay
bondholders in 1994 will be raised from the sale of the underlying Venezuela
bonds in the secondary market. If the secondary market price of the
conversion bonds falls substantially, the sale might not generate enough
funds to repay holders of the new bonds in full.
Warrants on bonds have also been offered to investors keen for leveraged
exposure to Latin American credit risk.
Last week, Paribas Capital Markets launched an issue of warrants offering
investors the right to buy Brazilian 'multi-year deposit facility agreement'
(MYDFA) bonds - instruments based on Brazil's commercial bank debt and
already traded between financial institutions.
Again, while the potential rewards of leveraged exposure to Brazilian credit
risk are great, so are the risks.
Yesterday, the secondary market price of Brazilian MYDFA bonds sank from a
shade over 40 per cent of face value to 37 1/2 per cent, following
accusations of corruption levelled against President Fernando Collor.
The Paribas warrants offer the right to buy the bonds at 40 per cent.
Petroleos de Venezuela (PDVSA), the state oil company, will hold off for a
couple of months on placing more bonds on the international markets, AP-DJ
reports.
The move is being made because demand for bonds has dropped sharply, thanks
to the continuing appearance of political instability in the country
following a failed February coup attempt.
PDVSA is in the middle of a five-year, Dollars 48bn investment plan.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Bonds: NTT CDollars 200m issue leads activity
in subdued start to week

THE international bond market started the week in a more subdued mood,
following the flood of new issues last week. However, moderately sized and
cautiously priced deals were launched in Canadian dollars, sterling, French
francs and Australian dollars.
In the Canadian dollar sector, Nippon Telegraph and Telephone came with an
anticipated CDollars 200m five-year issue, lead-managed by Goldman Sachs.
The 8 1/2 per cent paper was re-offered to investors at the fixed price of
99.785, where the yield is 48 basis points more than Canadian government
bonds.
The deal was NTT's fourth in the Canadian dollar sector of the Eurobond
market, and it has built a strong following among continental European
retail investors. The proceeds of the issue were swapped back into yen.
Participants in the deal reported strong buying for bonds, which were viewed
as being sensibly priced. By the close of trading in London, the deal stood
at a yield spread of 46 basis points.
Municipality Finance, the local government financing vehicle of Finland,
launched its debut in the sterling sector of the market. It launched a
Pounds 100m five-year issue, jointly lead-managed by UBS Phillips &amp; Drew and
Credit Suisse First Boston.
The 9 1/2 per cent bonds were reoffered at a fixed price of 99.43, at which
level the yield spread over UK government bonds was 34 basis points. This
was seen as tight by participants for a little-known borrower. Municipality
Finance is best remembered by some investors for a debut Ecu issue launched
last September which has since performed poorly.
However, the joint lead managers underwrote around 90 per cent of the deal
and reported steady buying from continental European investors keen to buy
sterling bonds at a healthy yield pick-up over government paper. UBS quoted
the bonds at a yield spread of 34 basis points by the close.
Another debutante was KFW, the top-rated German government-backed financing
agency, which launched its first French franc issue. The FFr2bn 8 3/4 per
cent 10-year deal was lead-managed by Credit Lyonnais and offers a yield of
35 basis points more than French government paper.
International investors are keen buyers of French franc assets, and the deal
appealed to institutions keen for additional yield over government bonds but
wary of buying of lower credit quality. By the close of trading, the yield
spread had narrowed to 31 basis points.
Deutsche Bank launched a ADollars 100m six-year issue, hoping to capture
flows from maturing Australian dollar Eurobonds, which amount to ADollars
750m over the next month.
The paper carries a 9 per cent coupon, seen as necessary to attract retail
buyers into the deal, but was issued 102, an unusually high premium to face
value. Less full fees of 2 per cent, the level at which underwriters owned
the bonds, the paper yielded 23 basis points more than Australian government
paper.
Tintas, a Brazilian paint company, launched a Dollars 40m two-year Eurobond
issue yesterday, despite the turbulence of domestic financial markets
following accusations of corruption against President Ferdinand Collor. The
deal is lead-managed by ABN Amro.
The Turkish government is rescheduling almost half the commercial bank debts
of the loss-making Turkish Iron and Steel Works (TDCI) by securitisation,
Reuter reports from Istanbul.
State minister, Mr Tansu Ciller, said the six Turkish banks involved would
receive state bonds after rescheduling TL1,000bn of TDCI's TL2,200bn debt
bearing a compounded interest burden of 135 per cent. Turkish inflation
presently runs at 74 per cent.

FANUC, the Japanese maker of numerical control devices and other machine
tools equipment, yesterday reported its first profit fall in five years and
warned that earnings would slide further in the current year.
For the 1991 fiscal year group pre-tax earnings fell 25.4 per cent to Y52bn
(Dollars 401.8m).
The company predicted that earnings will decline by 29.3 per cent to Y36.9bn
in the current fiscal year.
The company blames the setback on Japanese companies' continuing reduction
in spending on industrial facilities.
Net profit decreased by 20.1 per cent to Y30.1bn, and it is predicted to
fall to Y20bn in fiscal 1992. Sales were down by 15.6 per cent to Y155.8bn,
reflecting a 20 per cent fall in orders.
Fanuc expects a further 9.4 per cent decrease in turnover in fiscal 1992
largely due to the sluggish Japanese economy.
Shiseido, the cosmetics company, posted a 7 per cent rise in consolidated
sales to Y553.3bn for the year to end-March, on strong demand of higher
value cosmetics and hair treatment products.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Equity Issues: Reliance offering a test case

<TEXT>
INVESTORS in the emerging markets will be keeping a close eye on the Dollars
100m international equity offering from Reliance, the Indian petrochemical
company, as a handful of other Indian companies prepare to raise funds in
the international markets.
The Reliance equity offering was due to be priced either late last night or
in the next couple of days. The shares are expected to be priced at about
Rs250, (the lower end of the pricing range) compared with the closing price
of Rs300 in Bombay yesterday.
The Reliance equity offering marks the first time that foreign investors
have been allowed to invest in a share offering by an Indian company.
However, there are three other Indian companies hoping to launch
international offerings within the next couple of months.
Grasim, a cement and fibre producer controlled by the Birla family, is
expected to launch its Dollars 100m offering around the middle of June, with
Citicorp and Merrill Lynch as the joint lead managers.
Also in the pipeline are share offerings of about Dollars 100m each from
Essar Gujarat, an iron company, and Tata Iron and Steel (TISCO), India's
largest private steel manufacturer. Merrill Lynch is lead manager for Essar
Gujarat, and Credit Suisse First Boston has been appointed lead manager for
the Tisco deal.
The Reliance issue has attracted strong interest, particularly from Asian
funds, despite the current stock market scandal in India.
'Fund managers don't want to miss out on this issue,' said one London
banker. 'People will be learning about the Indian market with Reliance.'
However, some investment bankers warn that India could suffer if it ends up
as the latest 'vogue' emerging market.
'Investors have been so country-of-the-week oriented,' complained one US
banker. 'The foreign investors just want to be first-in and first-out.'
While bankers expect the Reliance issue to be a success and comfortably
over-subscribed, most will be watching to see whether investors hold the
shares long-term in their portfolios or whether they simply take their
profits and run.

NORTHERN TELECOM, the Canadian telephone equipment maker, and Hong Kong's
Techtronic International are expanding their cellular business by separately
buying most of the assets of Novatel Communications, the troubled group
owned by the province of Alberta.
Novatel, which is one of North America's leading cellular equipment
suppliers, has been a heavy burden on Alberta taxpayers. The two buyers will
pay a total of CDollars 66.8m (Dollars 56m) but the provincial government
estimates its total investment in Novatel at CDollars 566m.
Northern Telecom will pay CDollars 38m for Novatel's cellular radio systems
division, including installations in North and South America, and the
Caribbean. The company has also promised to convert one of Novatel's two
factories into a wireless research centre in Calgary.

<TEXT>
SUMITOMO Heavy Industries, a leading Japanese shipbuilder and steelmaker,
posted a non-consolidated 5.6 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Y4.23bn (Dollars 32.8m) for the year to end-March.
Gains in financial items accounted for the rise at the pre-tax level.
However, the company suffered its first drop in operating profits in four
years as a result of higher costs, with a decline of 14.3 per cent to
Y11.8bn related to products sold.
The value of Sumitomo Heavy's short-term securities portfolio plunged
Y41.9bn to Y93.7bn.
Net profits were off 13.6 per cent at Y3.5bn because of an extraordinary
loss resulting from suspended printing machine manufacturing and sales
activities.
The company, which no longer counts shipbuilding as its main activity, has
diversified into construction, cargo handling and injection molding.
It delivered six mid-sized ships during the period.
Machinery sales declined 1.9 per cent to Y81.5bn, while orders were up 4.8
per cent at Y91.9bn. Shipbuilding, steel frame and defence equipment sales
were off 1.4 per cent at Y86.8bn, and orders fell 47.1 per cent to Y68bn.
Standardised and mass-production machinery turnover fell 2.8 per cent to
Y80bn and orders declined 10.3 per cent to Y72bn. Quantum and other
equipment sales jumped 87.6 per cent to Y38.8bn and orders by 76.3 per cent
to Y48.6bn.
This year, Sumitomo Heavy expects sales to rise 4.5 per cent to Y300bn,
while pre-tax profits are expected to slip 6 per cent to Y4bn and net
profits by 28 per cent to Y2.5bn.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Launch date for Sony's Mini Disc
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SONY, the Japanese consumer electronics group, said yesterday it planned to
introduce its Mini Disc portable player, a miniaturised version of the
compact disc, in Japan by November 1 and in main overseas markets by
Christmas.
The Mini Disc is competing against the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC) as the
next-generation recording system with the audio quality of the compact disc
(CD).
Sony, which is seeking a new popular product to reverse its fall in earnings
for fiscal 1991, hopes the Mini Disc will repeat the success of its Walkman
cassette player, with the Mini Disc replacing cassettes in the same way the
CD has succeeded the long-playing record.
The Mini Disc will be the first compact disc system able to record as well
as play. Sony said it would price the Mini Disc at Y80,000 (Dollars 617) for
a record/playback model and Y60,000 for a playback-only version.
Pre-recorded mini disc albums would cost about the same as CD albums, which
is Y2,500 in Japan, while blank discs would be about Y1,000.
Matsushita recently announced it would market its first Digital Compact
Cassette (DCC) player in Japan on September 21. The DCC table unit would be
priced at Y135,000. A portable DCC player is scheduled to be launched next
spring at a lower price. The DCC technology, which uses a cassette tape, was
developed by Philips of the Netherlands.
Analysts believe that the Mini Disc may have gained a competitive edge over
the DCC, at least in the Japanese market, because of its lower price and its
compact disc format.
'The failure of digital audio tape (Dat) indicates that consumer interest in
the use of cassette tape is waning, while the preference for compact discs
is growing,' says Mr Chuck Goto, an analyst at S. G. Warburg Securities. The
price of the Mini Disc must still fall further to penetrate the mass market,
he adds.
However, Mr Barry Dargan, deputy head of research at James Capel in Tokyo,
believes there is still consumer resistence to both the Mini Disc and DCC
systems, with the most popular alternative being a recordable standard-size
compact disc. 'The advantage with the Mini Disc is that it is at least a
step in that direction.'
Sony said it has signed licensing agreements with 22 hardware manufacturers
for Mini Disc technology. They include many of the main Japanese and Korean
consumer electronics companies. Eight companies have signed similar
agreements to produce recorded software and 10 to make blank discs.

aircraft demand falls

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EMBRAER, the state-owned Brazilian aeronautics company set for
privatisation, is to reduce its 8,200-strong work force by 30 per cent.
The company's factory will remain idle until June 4, and about 5,200
employees will join another 2,600 who have been on paid leave since March.
Depressed international demand for aircraft had led to the cuts, the company
said. Production of Embraer's leading product, the 30-seat turboprop
Brasilia, is still projected to reach 36 units this year but output dropped
from 48 units in 1990 to 31 last year.
The worldwide recession, especially in the US, has been taking its toll on
the company. In 1991, sales reached just Dollars 402m; exports accounted for
Dollars 271.5m of the total. In 1990, overall sales were Dollars 582m and
exports Dollars 365m.
Brasilia sales account for half of Embraer's receipts, and the depressed
market was evident in the results for 1991, when the company lost Dollars
235m.
In 1990, it suffered a loss of Dollars 265m. Analysts warned, however, that
comparisons between 1990 and 1991 results for Brazilian companies were
difficult due to changes in accounting regulations.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Japan's top shipping lines slip
but competitors show gains
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NIPPON Yusen (NYK) and Mitsui OSK Lines, Japan's two biggest shipping
companies, have reported lower pre-tax earnings for 1991-92, but expect
profits to increase this year.
In contrast, their three closest domestic competitors - Kawasaki Kisen
Kaisha, Navix Line and Showa Line - all posted sharp profits gains for the
year ended March 1992.
Reduced interest payments helped boost the profitability of Kawasaki, Navix
and Showa, although the latter two expect lower earnings this year.
Both NYK and Mitsui OSK blamed their earnings declines on foreign exchange
losses.
NYK's pre-tax profits dropped by 2.7 per cent to Y14.1bn (Dollars 109.3m),
although sales rose by 6.8 per cent to Y569bn due to a recovery in liner and
tramper operations. Net profits rose 26.8 per cent to Y6.5bn due to lower
taxes. The dividend was unchanged at Y4.
NYK predicts that pre-tax profits in the current year will rise 6.1 per cent
to Y15bn, while sales will increase 3.7 per cent to Y590bn due to its recent
takeover of Nippon Liner System. Net profits are expected to decrease by 8.1
per cent to Y6bn.
Mitsui's pre-tax profits fell by 31.7 per cent to Y7.4bn, although sales
rose by 5.5 per cent to Y480.9bn. It noted that liner operations to Europe
had returned to profitability, while losses on North American routes were
halved due to increased shipments of consumer products.
Net profit fell by 60.9 per cent to Y2.3bn, but the dividend was left
unchanged at Y4.
Mitsui expects sales in fiscal 1992 to rise to Y500bn as the liner
operations improve to the break-even point with growing shipments of raw
materials. Pre-tax profits will also increase to Y10bn, while net profit
will reach Y5bn.
Kawasaki was the only top Japanese shipping company to record an increase in
sales and pre-tax profits. It expects the upward trend to continue this
fiscal year.
Navix and Showa had lower sales, reflecting reduced rates for tankers and
iron-ore tramps. But their pre-tax profits rose. Navix attributed the 166
per cent increase in pre-tax earnings to Y3.4bn to the dividends received in
return for the sale of ships.
Navix and Showa expect the situation to be reversed this year, with higher
sales but lower pre-tax profits.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: Philips says price of DCC tapes
to match CDs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PHILIPS, the Dutch group, and Polygram, the music recording company in which
it owns a 79 per cent stake, yesterday announced the prices of digital
compact cassette (DCC) tapes would be similar to the prices of compact discs
currently being sold, writes Michiyo Nakamoto.
Polygram also announced a list of musicians - featuring Bryan Adams, U2 and
Fine Young Cannibals among the pop set, and Pavarotti and von Karajan from
the classical world - whose music would be available on DCC when the system
is launched in September.
The company plans to have about 500 music titles ready when DCC systems
become available.
The pricing of pre-recorded music on the new digital cassettes has been an
important issue in the industry and one which many observers believe will be
a key factor determining the success of or failure of the DCC.
If much of the pre-recorded music on DCC is priced at levels similar to the
price of compact discs, they will be substantially higher than the price of
analogue audio-cassettes, which they are intended to replace.
In the UK, the current price of a hit album on compact discs, at Pounds
14.99 (Dollars 27.13) at leading retailers, has already attracted consumer
criticism as being excessively high. It compares with a retail price of
Pounds 8.99 for a hit album on analogue tape.

years 1990-1991, despite the disruption of its operations by the Iraqi

The results came in accordance with directives to local banks to combine the
two years' results. The last full-year result of the bank was in 1989, when
it announced a 13 per cent rise in its net profit to 34.2m dinars.

<TEXT>
SEIKO, a leading maker of watches and clocks, suffered a sharp fall in
profits after being hurt by weak demand for its main line of watches and at
its jewellery operations
The company recorded a 26.4 per cent drop in pre-tax profits to Y3.6bn
(Dollars 27.9m) for the year ended March, its first retreat since the
1987-88 fiscal year.
Seiko noted that consumer demand for high-priced goods had dropped
precipitously during the current economic slowdown. Sales for the period
dipped 2.3 per cent to Y298.7bn, while net profits advanced 7.6 per cent to
Y1.5bn.
Domestic sales were off 2.5 per cent at Y187.1bn, while exports fell 1.9 per
cent to Y111.6bn.
By division, sales of watches slipped 2.6 per cent to Y178.5bn and clocks
2.1 per cent to Y44.5bn. Jewellery turnover was off 4.6 per cent at Y26.7bn,
although other items staged a 0.1 per cent gain to Y49bn.
For the current period, Seiko expects the positive effects of price
stability in Japan to be more than offset by continued weakness in corporate
earnings and the stock market.
Sales are expected to rise 0.4 per cent to Y300bn, while pre-tax profits are
forecast to slip 2.6 per cent to Y3.5bn and net profits 1 per cent to
Y1.5bn.
Kandenko, Japan's largest electrical engineering company, reported solid
gains in unconsolidated sales and profit for the year to end-March, Kyodo
reports from Toyko.
Net profit increased 14.1 per cent over the previous year to Y12.36bn, or
Y105.82 a share, up from Y102.50. Pre-tax profit also rose 14.5 per cent to
Y29.40bn on sales of Y520.23bn, up 8.2 per cent.

<TEXT>
TOBISHIMA, the Japanese general contractor which has appealed to banks for
interest rate cuts on its debts of Y1,000bn (Dollars 7.75bn), blamed an
after-tax loss of Y44.3bn on charges related to the company's restructuring.
Sales during the year rose 9.8 per cent to Y460.6bn. However, the company
said the general awareness of its financial problems may unnerve potential
clients and, as a result, orders for the current year were expected to fall
by 14.5 per cent to Y420bn.
Tobishima is shifting back to its core business of contracting and away from
hotel and resort development, which led the company into financial
difficulty during the late 1980s. Officials from Fuji Bank, its main bank,
are overseeing the restructuring plan.
For the current year, Tobishima's pre-tax profit is expected to double to
Y3bn, while the company is aiming for an after-tax profit of Y500m.
Kumagai Gumi, the general contractor, reported a 24.7 per cent fall in
pre-tax profit to Y38bn on a 4.7 per cent decline in sales to Y1,145bn which
followed a decision to cut its exposure in the international market.
The construction industry is hoping the government's plan to accelerate
budget spending, and perhaps to announce a supplementary budget later this
week, will bolster earnings.
Kumagai is expecting sales this year to remain at around Y1,150bn, while
pre-tax profits are forecast to fall a further 21 per cent to Y30bn.

FT  27 MAY 92 / International Company News: ABSA turns in earnings of R491m
in first full year
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP GAWITH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ABSA, South Africa's largest banking group, reported attributable earnings
of R491.4m (Dollars 174m) in the year to March, the first full year of the
group's existence.
ABSA was formed in early 1991 from the merger of the United Building
Society, Allied, Volkskas and part of the Sage group. A further merger,
early in 1992, with the Bankorp group, confirmed ABSA's status as South
Africa's largest banking group in terms of assets.
The effects of this second merger, which is still being carried out, are not
reflected in the current results. The timing of the first merger invalidates
comparison with earlier results.
The net interest margin was R2.3bn, but set against this was a very large
provision of R451m for bad and doubtful debts. Other operating income was
R974.5m, leaving total operating income of R2.85bn. Operating expenditure
was R2.2bn.
Total assets of ABSA rose by 8.5 per cent to R56.2m - in line with the
industry, but a 6 per cent drop in real terms.
Mortgage loans represent 33 per cent of total assets, reflecting United and
Allied's roots as building societies. Total advances in the group came to
R42bn.
Commenting on the rationalisation, Mr Herc Hefer, chairman, said the group
had exceeded expectations by achieving net cost savings of R98m. These arose
mainly from the integration of the support services of Allied, United and
Volkskas.
There were three main phases to the rationalisation which included
consolidating the group's insurance interests and related financial
services, and integrating support and technical services.
Mr Piet Badenhorst, chief executive, said the bad debt figure reflected the
fact that the level of provisions in the group had been upgraded to the
standard maintained at United. Slightly more than half of the provisions
relate to Volkskas.
He said the group's exposure to the agricultural sector - currently in the
grips of a severe drought - was in line with that of its competitors.
Earnings per share rose by 15.2 per cent to 107.6 cents and the dividend was
lifted to 39.5 cents from 36 cents.
The policy is that the dividend cover, now up to 2.7, should reach 3.
Mr Hefer said despite the poor operating climate, further rationalisation
savings should help lift profits in the coming year.

weak second quarter

   CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
DEERE &amp; Co, the US equipment maker, continued to struggle with a sluggish
worldwide market for agricultural and construction machinery.
For its second quarter, ended April 30, it reported net income of Dollars
44m, or 58 cents a share, sharply down from Dollars 73.1m, or 96 cents, in
the same period last year. Worldwide sales and revenues decreased 3 per cent
to Dollars 1.86bn from Dollars 1.93bn.
The operating results reflect lower production and sales volumes, partly
because of the poor market and partly because of the company's efforts to
reduce inventories.
Buyer incentives remained high, given competition in the industry, and these
promotions cut into margins.
While the second-quarter results were an improvement on the net loss of
Dollars 19.9m, or 26 cents a share, during the first quarter, Mr Hans
Becherer, chairman, warned that the company's outlook this year for the
equipment market was 'less positive'.
Deere will thus reduce its production tonnage by 7 per cent this year
compared with last year's levels.
While farm and industrial equipment accounted for about 70 per cent of the
company's second-quarter sales, lawn and grounds care equipment sales were
the only bright spot, picking up by 21 per cent to Dollars 261m from Dollars
216m last year.
Second-quarter results in Deere's other divisions fared better. Net income
of its credit operations rose to Dollars 25.8m from Dollars 22.1m last year
and net income from insurance and healthcare operations was Dollars 10.9m,
up marginally from Dollars 10.4m a year ago.
Worldwide net income in the first six months was Dollars 24.1m, or 32 cents
a share, compared with net income of Dollars 30m, or 39 cents, last year.
Net sales and revenues for the first six months were Dollars 3.31bn, down 2
per cent from Dollars 3.36bn.

KOMATSU, the Japanese construction equipment manufacturer, has reported a
50.6 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax earnings to Y41.9bn (Dollars
324.8m) for the fiscal year ending March 31.
The profit slide and a 7 per cent decline in sales to Y919.8bn were blamed
on weak demand for construction equipment in Japan, the US and Europe as
housing starts were hit hard by recession.
Komatsu predicted that pre-tax profits would level off at Y42bn in the
current fiscal year on higher sales of Y950bn, while net profit would
increase to Y15bn from Y10.9bn.
Sales of construction equipment, which account for almost two-thirds of
total sales, fell by 12.3 per cent to Y579bn.
However Komatsu recorded sales growth in other business areas that it has
been developing in an attempt to diversify.
Revenues from industrial machinery, including machine tools, rose by 1.5 per
cent to Y87.9bn.
Turnover in the electronics division climbed by 7.5 per cent to Y54.9bn,
while civil engineering and construction services increased by 11 per cent
to Y86.2bn due to the steady expansion of public sector projects.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BOUYGUES, one of the world's largest construction groups, is to raise
FFr1.04bn (Dollars 180m) of new equity capital, the first leading French
quoted company to launch a big rights issue in the present stock market
rally.
The group is to issue 1.712m new shares at FFr610 each, a 5.4 per cent
discount to yesterday's opening price, to help 'pursue the development of
its mainstream activities and its diversification in France and abroad,'
said Bouygues.
It was interested in buying parts - but not all - of Elbo, the east German
construction group being privatised, said Mr Martin Bouygues, chairman. He
predicted the group's profits would rise this year from last year's FFr635m
net on turnover of around FFr64bn, about the same as in 1991.
Stockmarket analysts had expected Bouygues to take advantage of the recent
strength of its share price, up by 20 per cent from mid-February, the start
of the stock market rally, to a peak of FFr675 in mid-May. However, the
share price fell FFr19 to FFr626 by yesterday afternoon, on fears that the
rights issue would dilute earnings per share.
Other leading French groups will soon follow Bouygues' example while share
prices continue their strength, said Mr David Harrington, research analyst
at James Capel in Paris.
Bouygues has not had a rights issue for six years and was thought
undercapitalised in relation to total assets. Its debts stood at an
estimated 46 per cent of shareholders' funds at the end of last year.
Nearly three quarters of the issue, FFr744.2m, will be reserved for French
shareholders, with the remainder for international investors. Subscriptions
will be open from May 28 to June 16.
Alcatel Cable has already said it is planning to raise up to FFr1.5bn next
month. Others thought likely to benefit from an injection of fresh equity
capital include Michelin, the indebted tyre maker, Moulinex, the household
appliance group, and Ciments Francais, the construction materials supplier.

NORWAY'S top 34 savings banks, which represent 80 per cent of the combined
assets of the savings banks, yesterday reported a sharp improvement in
first-quarter performance, helped by improved net interest earnings, lower
operating costs and cheaper funding by the central bank.
According to the Savings Banks' Association, the banks boosted first-quarter
net interest income to NKr2.64bn (Dollars 418m) from NKr2.55bn last year.
Other operating income rose by NKr50m to NKr450m while operating costs were
reduced to NKr1.87bn from NKr2.04bn.
Combined first-quarter credit losses were slightly up by NKr30m to NKr860m,
however, while the 34 banks' combined operating profit improved to NKr360m
from NKr80m in last year's first quarter.
The Savings Banks Association yesterday reiterated sharp criticism of the
amount of state support issued last year to prop up the country's top three
commercial banks, saying it was undermining competition.
The association singled out Christiania Bank, which was acquired last year
by the state after its equity capital was wiped out by massive losses.

ELECTROLUX, the Swedish household appliances multinational, announced a
sharp drop in profits (after financial items) for the first quarter of the
year to SKr253m (Dollars 43.41m) from SKr414m for the same period of 1991.
Income for the first quarter of last year included a SKr184m capital gain
for divestments in the company's commercial services business area. If that
is excluded the group made a 10 per cent improvement in its profits for
on-going operations for the first quarter.
A 2 per cent growth was recorded in sales to SKr19.46bn from SKr19.23bn in
the same period last year.
The earnings per share after full tax dropped to SKr0.20 from SKr3.60 in the
first quarter of last year. The shareholders yesterday approved Electrolux's
decision to maintain its dividend at SKr12.50 per share.
In his address to the shareholders Mr Leif Johansson, president, said the
restructuring programme of the past two years with the closure of 10 plants
and a cut of 15,000 in the workforce had 'radically improved the production
structure as well as productivity'. He added that inventory costs dropped by
more than SKr1bn last year with a 'significant improvement in the cash
flow'. He said Electrolux was moving into a phase when it would devote more
resources to selling in existing markets as well as intensifying the search
for new ones.
Electrolux said that the European market for its products had slackened
during the first quarter especially in the Nordic countries, but it added
that there were also signs of stagnation in Germany. By contrast demand in
the US market increased for household appliances but from a low base in the
first quarter of last year.
Overall profitability in the group's household appliances division rose.

NET profits at Thyssen, the German steel, engineering and trading group,
fell 11 per cent to DM203m (Dollars 123m) in the first half of the current
year. While group sales rose 1.7 per cent to DM18bn, turnover from the core
steel business continued downwards and the volume of incoming orders taken
by all divisions fell 0.5 per cent to DM19.1bn.
Sales of capital goods rose from DM5.14bn to DM5.81bn.
Net earnings of DM203m, compared with DM227m in the first six months of 1991
and DM363m in 1990, matched market expectations, and reflected the
continuing weakness of international and domestic markets.
Meanwhile, the group is rationalising its existing businesses and looking
for acquisitions or partnerships which will reduce its dependence on the
highly-cyclical steel and heavy engineering markets.
Mr Heinz Kriwet, chief executive, said recently it was interested in
telecommunications or consumer goods.
The group's two main steel businesses, Thyssen Stahl and Thyssen Edelstahl,
which yesterday reported substantial sales declines to DM5.09bn and DM1.53bn
respectively, are to be merged later this year in an attempt to prune costs.
Klockner-Humboldt-Deutz, the engines and agricultural machinery maker,
yesterday forecast a 'negative result' for the first half of 1992 but said
it expected to return to profit by the end of the year.
Sales in the first four months had fallen to DM960m from DM1.17bn in the
comparable period of 1991.
Meanwhile the company plans to increase its capital base before its current
authorisation runs out in mid-1995, according to Mr Werner Kirchgasser,
chairman. Timing of the issue of new shares would depend partly on the
condition of capital markets and partly on the group's ability to improve
its earnings significantly.
Krupp's takeover of Hoesch, and the creation of a new force in the European
steel industry, has been given the go-ahead by the European Commission.
Krupp has also announced the proposed terms for buying in the Hoesch shares
it does not own.
The merged group, with sales of about DM30bn and 100,000 employees, would
still be smaller than the community's four steel giants, the commission
said, and market domination was not an issue.
The two companies have agreed the final terms for the takeover, which
include Krupp's offering 13 of its shares plus DM6 in cash for every 10
Hoesch shares.
Although no details are available of how much Krupp paid for its 51 per cent
stake, the total value of the deal is estimated at over DM1bn. The final
formalities are expected at an extraordinary general meeting at Hoesch on
July 27.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BANK OF Nova Scotia has boosted its fiscal 1992 loan loss provisions by
CDollars 200m (USDollars 168m) or 45 per cent, to reflect its exposure to
Olympia &amp; York and other troubled borrowers.
The bank, Canada's fourth biggest, nonetheless reported a small increase in
second-quarter earnings, with the extra write down exactly offset by a
recovery in third world loans. As a result, the second-quarter provision of
CDollars 110m is unchanged from the previous three months. The provision in
the second quarter of 1991 was CDollars 85m.
Although they are among O&amp;Y's biggest lenders, the Canadian banks are
generally well-equipped to absorb substantial losses. BNS for instance,
reported that its risk-weighted capital-to-assets ratio improved in the
second quarter to 8.6 per cent from 8.3 per cent a year earlier.
Net earnings rose to CDollars 171m, or 75 cents a share, in the three months
to April 30, from CDollars 163.3m, or 73 cents, a year earlier. The
improvement was largely due to wider margins as both domestic and foreign
interest rates continued to decline. Return on equity slipped, however, to
16 per cent from 17.6 per cent.
BNS disclosed earlier that its total exposure to O&amp;Y is CDollars 600m. But
with the loans largely secured by prime office buildings and marketable
securities, the bank said that it expects 'substantial recoveries'.
Total non-performing loans, net of provisions, rose to CDollars 1.87bn on
April 30 from CDollars 1.74bn three months earlier.

<TEXT>
SG WARBURG SODITIC, the Geneva subsidiary of the British merchant bank, has
purchased the 35.8 per cent stake in the Swiss travel group Kuoni held by
Swissair, the Swiss national airline, and sold it to European institutional
clients.
Terms were not revealed, but following the announcement of the transaction
the price of Kuoni bearer shares rose SFr1,100 to SFr23,900, valuing the
Swissair stake at SFr119.9m (Dollars 81m).
The sale has been rumoured for some time as part of a Swissair programme to
sell off peripheral activities.
'By pulling out of Kuoni, Swissair is underlining its intention to
concentrate on its core businesses, the transport of people and goods, and
related services,' the airline said.
Mr Luigi De Carlo of Warburg Soditic said that one quarter of the shares
were placed with Swiss institutions. The remainder were placed with
institutional customers elsewhere in Europe.
Warburg's view was that the shares were undervalued and that the wide
distribution of the Swissair stake would raise liquidity and investor
interest. The Kuoni-Hugentobler Foundation still has absolute control of
Kuoni, with a 52.6 per cent voting stake.

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Radio Clyde tunes in to 57% increase after
Forth purchase
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RADIO CLYDE Holdings, which since its merger with Radio Forth last year
broadcasts to all the main cities in Scotland, increased pre-tax profit by
57 per cent, from Pounds 707,000 to Pounds 1.11m, in the six months to March
31.
Turnover at the USM-quoted group advanced to Pounds 6.62m, reflecting the
all-share acquisition completed in April last year. Because of the extra
equity, earnings per share rose only 1p to 8.3p. The interim dividend is
held at 3.25p.
Mr John Bowman, finance director, said the original Clyde group made
operating profits of Pounds 798,000. Forth added Pounds 261,000, while Buzz
FM, a Birmingham station aimed at a younger audience, lost Pounds 89,000.
Clyde had only recently taken effective control of Buzz after spending about
Pounds 750,000 over 18 months to buy 97 per cent of it.
Interest received amounted to Pounds 143,000 and the group had Pounds 2.5m
cash at the half-way stage, compared with Pounds 3m last year, with Buzz
accounting for the difference.
Mr James Gordon, chief executive, said local advertising revenue, which
accounted for 70 per cent of the total, rose by 8 per cent year-on-year and
had reached a record level. Growth in national advertising was 5 per cent
and there had been some encouraging signs in April and May.
The group, which has missed out in the bidding for the first two national
commercial radio stations, said it would not bid for the third speech-based
one. It was continuing to look for other areas in which to invest.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 270,000 rose from a change in accounting
treatment for Satellite Media Services, in which it now has a 28.6 per cent
stake. An anticipated sale had fallen through, leading to the accounting
change.
The business was close to breaking even and the sale of the stake was not
being actively pursued.

ICL, the UK-based computer manufacturer in which Fujitsu of Japan has a

It said yesterday that it had appointed Schroders as merchant bankers and
Cazenove as lead broker, assisted by Warburg. The search for financial
advisers has been under way since the beginning of the year.
Fujitsu paid Pounds 743m for an 80 per cent stake in ICL two years ago; at
the time it said it would float at least 25 per cent of the company in
London within five years at a minimum price of 225p a share, giving ICL a

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Mowlem serves Pounds 18.5m writ on Eagle
Star
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL, Business Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE long-running dispute between John Mowlem, the construction group, and
Eagle Star, one of Britain's biggest insurance companies, has escalated
further with Mowlem serving a writ for loss and damages exceeding Pounds
18.5m.
The action arose following claims by Mowlem that it was wrongfully dismissed
as management contractor on the Carlton Gate development of luxury flats in
Maida Vale, north London. The contractor was dismissed in 1989.
The developer, Carlton Gate Development, was half-owned by Eagle Star, a
subsidiary of BAT Industries. The balance was held by a banking consortium
led by Security Pacific EuroFinance. When it was put into receivership in
December 1991, Mowlem accused the company of behaving 'deplorably' and of
taking the action to avoid its financial obligations.
Shortly afterwards, an arbitrator found that Mowlem had been wrongfully
dismissed and awarded it Pounds 12.25m plus costs. The company said that
virtually none of the award had been paid.
Mowlem is pursuing separately a claim for Pounds 1.1m against Phippen
Randall &amp; Parkes, the project architects, which it claimed had wrongfully
deducted money from payments properly due to the contractor.
Mowlem alleged the architects had also unlawfully conspired with Eagle Star
to terminate the management contractor's Carlton Gate contract. Both
parties, according to Mowlem, had wrongfully interfered with, and procured a
breach of, its contract.
Phippen Randall &amp; Parkes said it had acted properly throughout the project
and was fully confident that any tribunal would reach the same conclusion.
Eagle Star said it refuted all the allegations made by Mowlem in its
'spurious and mischievous' writ and would vigorously defend its case.

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Price increases help East Surrey rise 42%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EAST SURREY Holdings, the small water supply company based in Redhill, has
announced a 42 per cent increase in pre-tax profits, helped by price
increases and a lower interest charge.
But the company has warned that a hosepipe and sprinkler ban in force since
March may have to be extended if rain levels are low in the autumn.
'Our bore holes are now at the levels we normally expect for the end rather
than beginning of summer,' said Mr Ian Foster, managing director.
East Surrey lifted profits from Pounds 3.91m to Pounds 5.54m in the year to
March 31.
It heralds the start of the month-long reporting season for the 25 water
supply companies and 10 privatised water services companies in England and
Wales.
Turnover increased 30 per cent to Pounds 21.9m (Pounds 16.9m).
Mr Foster said the steep increases in profits and sales reflected the last
year of East Surrey's high K allowance, the amount of increase allowed above
the rate of inflation.
K was set at 16 per cent last year, following 16.5 per cent in 1991.
This high allowance was designed to bring companies such as East Surrey in
line with the privatised water services companies and prepare for heavy
capital expenditure programmes.
East Surrey's K allowance has been reduced to 2 per cent for this year,
although the company has agreed with Ofwat, the water regulator, that price
rises will not be above inflation.
East Surrey warned that the rate of growth of its water business could now
slow.
Operating costs rose to Pounds 15.4m (Pounds 11.6m).
Most of the increase was due to extra spending on underground mains which
need upgrading. Capital expenditure rose to Pounds 6.8m (Pounds 6.5m).
Interest costs fell to Pounds 982,000 (Pounds 1.34m) following a debenture
repayment.
Earnings increased to 38.7p (26.6p). The company is recommending a final
dividend of 6p (5p) to give a total of 9.56p (8p), an increase of 19.5 per
cent.
East Surrey expanded its non-regulated business with two acquisitions,
including a small water treatment company. But non-regulated turnover
remained at under Pounds 1m, although Mr Foster said growth could be rapid.
The company said unbudgeted expenditure of Pounds 8m may be needed in
1994-95 to meet EC standards on water quality and pesticides. Tests are
under way to assess the final cost of compliance.

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The Battle For Midland - Chairman defends
Hongkong Bank's management record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR WILLIAM Purves, chairman of HSBC Holdings, yesterday defended Hongkong
Bank's record and ability to manage a global bank and told shareholders that
the planned merger with Midland Bank was in Hong Kong and China's best
interest as well as theirs.
Speaking at the bank's annual meeting Mr Purves said the merger with Midland
would create an international banking group that would be exceptionally well
capitalised. Shareholders would be able to participate in a growing
international group with considerable potential, he said.
Hongkong Bank's planned acquisition of Midland has not found favour among
Hong Kong investors. Many have criticised the plan to create a global bank,
saying the experience of the 1980s has underlined the difficulties of such a
strategy.
But Mr Purves responded to these criticisms yesterday and said Hongkong Bank
had long experience in managing operations that span the globe.
What it envisages with the merger with Midland 'is materially different from
other attempts to establish global banks.'
'Our approach is different because our organisation has always been built on
a series of separate franchises in a variety of countries.
'What links these franchises is our commitment to international banking  -
and our highly efficient technology through which we deliver competitive
products.'
Meanwhile, the bank said that Lloyds Bank's complaint to the US Federal
Reserve over Hongkong Bank's request for a 'fast track' approval of its
acquisition of Midland was 'yet another spoiling tactic'. It was the third
letter on this issue that Lloyds had sent the Fed, it said.
The bank would be writing to the Fed in due course pointing out that the
merger did not involve the acquisition of significant banking assets in the
US. It will also cite the Fed's quick approval of Deutsche Bank's purchase
of Morgan Grenfell as precedent for a timely determination.
In a separate announcement yesterday Hongkong Bank revealed its
long-foreshadowed board restructuring. It has moved to a two-tier structure
with HSBC Holdings overseeing the bank's global operations and the separate,
overlapping, board for Hongkong Bank focusing on the bank's interest
primarily in the colony.
Among new significant appointments is Baroness Lydia Dunne's elevation to
non-executive chairman of HSBC. Lady Dunne is an executive director of Swire
and also on the board of Volvo.
Mr Victor Li, the 27-year-old son of magnate Mr Li Ka-shing, has joined the
board of Hongkong Bank following his father's recent departure.

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Merry Hill interests the Richardsons -
Mountleigh shopping centre may revert to former majority owners
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DON AND Roy Richardson, the twins who developed the Merry Hill shopping
centre and sold a controlling interest in it to Mountleigh, could again
emerge as the majority owners.
'If we could get some arrangement on price we couldn't let a good deal pass
by,' Mr Don Richardson said yesterday, contemplating the implications of
Mountleigh's collapse and anticipating that the receiver, at some stage,
will sell off Mountleigh's interest.
The Richardsons do not expect the receiver to dispose of the centre, the
jewel in Mountleigh's somewhat tarnished UK property crown, at firesale
prices. 'If he did, we'd be the first there,' Mr Richardson observed.
The attraction - at a price - for the Richardsons is clear. Rents are higher
than when they sold it, the capital value undoubtedly less. About 25m
shoppers a year visit Merry Hill, near Dudley - indeed, it was packed
yesterday. After the MetroCentre in Gateshead, it is the second largest
shopping centre in Europe.
But the ownership of the Merry Hill shopping centre, itself part of a wider
development under construction in an enterprise zone since 1982 and
involving also offices and an industrial park, is complex. The adjacent
developments are largely owned by the Richardsons. The shopping centre
ownership, however, can be split at least five ways.
The first point is that the Richardsons still have a direct interest, the
exact extent of which they have not and will not disclose.
The second is that when the Richardsons, in December 1990, sold Mountleigh
an interest for a sum which, again, they would not disclose, but which
Mountleigh latterly valued at Pounds 160m, the payments were staged. Some
payments remain outstanding, but they are secured against part of the
property. Had Mountleigh managed to sell its interest to Hammerson, the UK
property group, and O'Connor Group of the US, earlier this year, at least
some of the takings would have found their way to the Richardsons.
The third facet of the ownership is the existence of the Richmount Laser
Trust, set up by Mountleigh and the Richardsons, to attract private
investors seeking tax shelters through the purchase of a property in an
enterprise zone. Part of the Merry Hill shopping centre is owned by the
Trust.
Fourth, during the years of the centre's development - over four years to
the completion of the last and biggest phase in 1990 - a series of
individual transactions were completed with the retailers. Some own their
freehold. Others are on leases of 99 and 999 years. Others again have
shorter leases: the terms of some of them are related to turnover.
The fifth slice of ownership is that of Mountleigh. It is estimated that of
the whole it is probably about 80 per cent. But that is not to say it owns
80 per cent of all the 260 shops on the 1.85m sq ft of retailing space at
the centre. While it might own the building, the retailer may have spent
twice the value of the building's shell on the interior.
Given the fragmentation of the ownership and the presence of the Richardsons
in the background, the sale of the Mountleigh interest in Merry Hill is
likely to be a lengthy affair. It is likely to be made more complicated by
fears that it might be on contaminated land, one of the reasons given for
the collapse of the Hammerson-O'Connor purchase.
The shopping centre is on the site of old railway sidings, next door to the
old Round Oak steelworks, which closed in 1984. The Richardsons are building
an office complex next door to the shopping centre on the Round Oak site.
But the land has not been designated by anybody as contaminated and the
Contaminated Land Register in which it was feared that it might appear does
not yet exist.

IRG, the Irish plastic packaging manufacturer, has advised its shareholders
to reject the IPounds 22m (Pounds 20m) bid by Barlo, an Irish radiator
manufacturer.
Mr Brendan O'Kelly, chairman, said the share-exchange bid - 55 Barlo for
every 20 IRG - 'offers IRG shareholders only 40 per cent of the combined
business'. He said that of the combined entity IRG would contribute 79 per
cent of turnover, 54 per cent of pre-tax profits and 51 per cent of net
assets.
'Your board believes this Barlo offer is inadequate and accordingly cannot
recommend that shareholders accept it', he stated.
IRG announced a 23 per cent fall in pre-tax profits from IPounds 2.9m to
IPounds 2.2m, on turnover marginally down to IPounds 55.9m (Pounds 56.4m)
for 1991. Earnings per share fell to 12.2p (16.8p). The dividend is held at
6.2p with a final of 4.45p.
The bid closes on June 4.

not be too concerned about their future.
They are the 300 staff at the large Galerias store on Madrid's prestigious
Calle Serrano who last Christmas won Pta12bn (Pounds 65.2m) in the country's
biggest lottery.
For the remaining 7,200 Galerias employees in each of its 29 stores around
Spain, the future is once again heavy with speculation and concern.
The administrative receivership of Mountleigh makes it 'inevitable' that
Galerias would have to be sold, Mr Tim Hayward, one of the Peat Marwick
receivers at Mountleigh, said in Madrid.
Mr Hayward, who is in Madrid to outline the receivership at Mountleigh to
senior Galerias management, also said one potential buyer had made an offer
for the chain.
It is believed this bid is being organised in New York and may involve Mr
Nelson Pelz and Mr Peter May, the US investors who bought control of
Mountleigh in late 1989 and subsequently sold half of their 22 per cent
stake.
Mr Michael Babcock, an American managing direc- tor appointed last year by
Mr Pelz and Mr May, has also suggested he might try to look for support to
buy the chain and it is highly likely that there will be other bidders.
One possibility is Marks and Spencer, which has recently opened two stores
in Spain and may be looking for more sites. But M and S is unlikely to want
all 29 Galerias stores.
Analysts say it will be difficult to put a price on the company. It is said
to have debts of close to Pounds 200m and last year, under new American
management, slipped back into losses after three profitable years.
Galerias' biggest creditor is probably Mountleigh itself, which has
guaranteed and raised some Dollars 150m (Pounds 85m) on Galerias' behalf in
the past two years, principally in London.
'It is not our intention to ask for the immediate repayment of that money,'
said Mr Hayward. 'It is our desire that Galerias continue to operate as a
going concern and we hope to be able to see it into safe hands.'
Galerias, which was yesterday trying to reassure suppliers and employees
that its operations would not be affected by the Mountleigh receivership,
has changed ownership four times already in the past 10 years. The chain was
owned by the Rumasa banking and trading group which the Spanish government
expropriated in 1983.
It was subsequently sold on by the government to the powerful Cisneros
family of Venezuela and, in 1987, to Mountleigh. Since its expropriation the
group has made money only in the three years it was under the control of a
management appointed by Mr Anthony Clegg, Mountleigh's founder.
In the 1990-91 year sales rose 34 per cent to Pta97.6bn compared with
1987-88, while income had increased 36 per cent to Pta33bn. The new
management under Mr Babcock has spent heavily on trying to take the chain
up-market, refurbishing stores and on advertising.
Although accounts for the last financial year, to April 30 this year, have
not been published, and Galerias was not available for comment yesterday,
sales growth is understood to have slowed to just 0.5 per cent while
expenses have risen sharply.
The group is thought to have ended last year with a loss of Pta3.8bn after
net profits of Pta1.2bn in 1990-91.
To combat its rising costs Galerias has been trying, with only partial
success, to sell and lease back some of its stores. It has had some
successes - although leasing has sent costs soaring - but as the Spanish
economy has slowed down, so have property prices. Galerias' problems in
selling its two sites in Barcelona are one measure of the problems it faces.

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: British Gas silent on hive off speculation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH GAS yesterday refused to confirm or deny speculation that the
company might hive off its regional businesses or float its exploration and
production business. The reports helped the shares gain 6 1/2 p yesterday to
257p.
The group announced in January that it was undertaking a fundamental review
of its operations, following continued pressure from Ofgas, the industry
regulator and the Office of Fair Trading to introduce more competition into
the gas market.
Analysts suggested that it might be more sensible to sell off its supply
businesses in advance of increased competition in the market, and allow
shareholders to benefit, than simply to wait for its market share to be
eroded. Another option would be to float the company's Pounds 4bn
exploration and production arm.
Speculation that British Gas might be considering such a move emerged again
this weekend following the publication of an interview with Mr Cedric Brown,
senior managing director at British Gas, despite Mr Brown's refusal to
comment. Mr Brown has been tipped to become chief executive, if that role is
relinquished by Mr Robert Evans, currently both chairman and chief
executive.
Mr Steve Turner, industry analyst at Smith New Court, and one of those who
has suggested that a break-up would be in British Gas's best interests, said
he believed such speculation was premature.
'British Gas faces the task of hiving off its pipeline business before the
end of the year. It would be irresponsible for the company to undertake
major restructuring before that has been achieved, and until the regulatory
debate about returns on the pipeline business has been settled.'

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Jupiter Tyndall's reconstruction plan for
CST
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jupiter Tyndall, the fund management group which is battling for control of
the Pacific Horizon Investment Trust, has announced proposals for the
reconstruction of CST Emerging Asia, another of the trusts in its stable.
The plan is to issue shareholders with zero coupon convertible unsecured
loan stock for nine-tenths of the nominal value of their existing shares.
CST would then tender for 60 per cent of the zero culs, allowing investors
to liquidate a substantial proportion of their holdings.
It is hoped that this plan would narrow the discount to net assets on which
CST shares trade. SG Warburg has estimated that a package of one share and 9
culs would have a value equivalent to 90 per cent of the trust's net asset
value.

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Management buy-out at Sharelink
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARELINK, one of the UK's three big private client stockbrokers, has been
bought out by its managers for an undisclosed sum.
The group, which regularly handles more than 10 per cent of the bargains on
the UK stock market, was launched in the late 1980s with backing from BT,
which owned 64.7 per cent of the company. Albert E Sharpe, the
Birmingham-based stockbroking group, had 31.3 per cent.
The sale reflects BT's aim of concentrating on its core telecommunications
business.
The buy-out, agreed at the weekend, is being backed by Foreign &amp; Colonial
Ventures and CINVen, which invests on behalf of the British Coal and British
Rail pension funds.
As part of the deal Mr David Jones, chairman, will increase his stake in the
company from 4 per cent to 20 per cent.
Sharelink, which conducts business over the telephone or through a postal
service, was launched as a low-cost rival to existing stockbrokers, and has
won a market share equal to the two other leaders, Barclays and NatWest
Stockbrokers.
Mr Jones was fresh to the stockbroking world when he approached BT with the
idea for Sharelink in 1986. His vision of a low-cost, automated dealing
service has helped to reshape the UK's retail stockbroking industry, forcing
other brokers to reduce their own cost bases to compete.
Sharelink made profits of Pounds 2.6m in the year to March 31 1991 and
slightly less in the year to this March, though profits have yet to be
disclosed.

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Lasmo offer likely to raise Dollars 30m
more than expected
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES IN Lasmo, the UK oil exploration and production company, gained 8p to
207p on news that it expects to receive Dollars 30m (Pounds 16.9m) more than
expected from the offering of its Canadian and US refining and marketing
business.
Including other factors, Lasmo could earn about Dollars 175m more from the
disposal than previously estimated.
Lasmo announced at the beginning of the month that it planned to float the
US downstream assets of Ultramar, the oil company it acquired in a Dollars
1.2bn takeover last year.
But a revised prospectus lodged with the US Securities and Exchange
Commission raises the price of the equity offering to between Dollars 590m
and Dollars 680m, an increase of some Dollars 30m over the previous price
range.
Proceeds from debt offerings remain unchanged at Dollars 400m, and together
with inter-company debt of Dollars 80m to be repaid, Lasmo will receive an
estimated Dollars 1.07bn to Dollars 1.16bn from the public offering.
This would put the estimated total net proceeds to Lasmo from the disposal
of the downstream businesses - including the refining and marketing
businesses, ships, and financial and property assets - at between Dollars
1.35bn and Dollars 1.44bn, compared with a previous net estimate of Dollars
1.17bn and Dollars 1.27bn. The proposed offering will go before an
extraordinary meeting of shareholders for approval on June 10.
Lasmo disappointed the stock market in March with a sharp drop in pre-tax
profits from Pounds 48.8m to Pounds 28.8m, with gearing up to 83 per cent.
The company hoped to reduce its Dollars 1.2bn debt burden by selling off
Ultramar's downstream assets, but has so far been unsuccessful, and opted
instead for a flotation. However, initial pricing details showing a
potential book loss again disappointed the City, sending the share price
tumbling 21p.
Lasmo made a small contribution to reducing its debts last week by selling
half its 57 per cent shareholding in Lasmo Canada for a profit of about
CDollars 38m (Pounds 17.5m).
The 10.1m shares were owned by its wholly-owned Lasmo International and
Lasmo Oil Development (Canada) subsidiaries. The deal, arranged by Gordon
Capital Corporation, priced the shares at CDollars 8.25, producing an
aggregate consideration of CDollars 83.2m before expenses.
A share purchase warrant attached to the shares entitles holders to buy
Lasmo's remaining shares in Lasmo Canada for CDollars 8.75 at any time up to
December 15 1993.
If the warrants were exercised in full, that would entail a further profit
to Lasmo of about CDollars 42m, and result in the disposal of its entire
interest in Lasmo Canada.

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Pounds 750m ticket tipped for MFI
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUILD-UP to the planned July flotation of MFI, the furniture group with
heavy debts going back to a 1987 management buy-out, has gathered momentum
with the issuing of new forecasts for profits and potential market value.
County NatWest, which is advising the company on the flotation, estimated
that trading profit for the 12 months to the end of April was Pounds 70m, up
from Pounds 48.6m, and forecast Pounds 100m for this year.
CNW said that if the group were given a rating in line with the stores
sector, its market value would be Pounds 750m.
An important assumption is that the flotation proceeds will reduce the
group's debts of about Pounds 500m to Pounds 100m, giving annualised
interest costs of little more than Pounds 10m. In 1990-91 interest payments
totalled nearly Pounds 80m, sending the group to a pre-tax loss of Pounds
24m.
It took on debt of Pounds 491m in 1987 during the buy-out from Asda which
valued the group at Pounds 718m. Asda retains a 25 per cent stake.
Mr Derek Hunt, chairman, said Pounds 20m was paid off before a refinancing
in August 1989.
Borrowings went back up to Pounds 503m, which is the figure expected in the
April 1992 accounts. Since then a further Pounds 15m has been paid off.
Mr Hunt and other directors, who own 3 per cent of the company, and 350
managers, could gain several million pounds from the flotation, depending on
the value.
MFI, with about 13 per cent of the UK furniture market, has benefited from
the collapse of such rivals as Lowndes Queensway and ELS, while Magnet,
another highly geared buy-out, has run into severe difficulties.
Mr Hunt said MFI had improved its operating margins without raising prices
by increasing efficiency and through turnover growth in the second half of
the year.
CNW estimates sales of Pounds 640m compared with Pounds 620.7m.
Mr Hunt hoped that after the flotation the number of banks involved in
lending money to the group could be reduced from 39 to three.
The pathfinder prospectus and full-year results are expected to be announced
on June 11.

FT  27 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Price war checks advance at Blacks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CUT-THROAT competition helped dampen the profits advance at Blacks Leisure,
the camping goods and sportswear company, which yesterday announced a Pounds
200,000 rise to Pounds 3.7m for the year to February 29, on sales 18 per
cent higher at Pounds 70.4m.
Mr Simon Bentley, chairman and chief executive, said one of the group's star
performers of 1991 - the distribution of LA Gear goods - had suffered from
US wholesalers dumping stock at much reduced prices in the UK. Retail
profits had also declined in the face of 'one of the severest recessions
this century' and price-cutting promotions from competitors.
Trading remained tough in the first half of the current year, Mr Bentley
said. 'There has been no sign of an improvement.'
However, some of the adverse conditions had been eliminated - such as the
dumping practice which had cost the company at least 30 per cent of LA Gear
sales.
The distribution operation improved overall profits before interest and tax
by 14 per cent to Pounds 4m, largely on the back of a record rise in the
sale of Fila brand goods. The figures included a marginal contribution from
Quaser, the sports goods company acquired for Pounds 1.9m in shares in
January.
The fashion and textiles division, now part of distribution, incurred a
'small loss' for the year. Mr Bentley said Blacks' longer-term plans
included selling this business which supplies retailers such as Burton and
Etam.
The retail operation, which sells camping and sporting goods, increased
outlets by nine to 69, and consumed Pounds 3m of the group's Pounds 3.7m
capital expenditure. Profits before interest and tax tumbled from Pounds 3m
to Pounds 1.93m as margins came under pressure from competitive
price-cutting.
The Pounds 4.7m rights issue in June, which helped cut debt from Pounds 10m
to Pounds 5.8m by the year-end, resulted in lower earnings per share of
9.82p (11.6p). The final dividend is maintained at 2.25p, resulting in a 10
per cent rise for the year to 3.35p.
COMMENT
Simon Bentley is determined to prove that Blacks' chequered past is dead and
gone. Organic growth and development of existing brands is the key, he says,
so Blacks does not expect to open retail stores this year. He also
emphasises that Blacks now has an in-house brand in Quaser, endorsed by Gary
Lineker. That endorsement could give a hefty boost this summer, if the
football hero scores just two more goals. That would make him England's
highest scoring player and kick into action a massive advertising campaign
for the brand. Such a windfall might offset gloomy noises about current
trading and fears that Blacks may lose its licence to distribute LA Gear
when it expires in 1994. Nevertheless, it might be better to wait for the
outcome of the important summer months before acting. House brokers are
forecasting flat profits of Pounds 3.75m, with a prospective p/e of 10.

Tottenham expects to get about Pounds 5m of the proceeds, which would wipe

FT  27 MAY 92 / SG Warburg reveals its hidden reserves
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FULL hidden reserves of SG Warburg were revealed for the first time
yesterday as the UK's leading merchant banking group reported full-year
profits in line with expectations at Pounds 166.3m.
Warburg said that a year ago its hidden reserves totalled Pounds 70.9m,
equivalent to nearly 10 per cent of its disclosed shareholders' funds of
Pounds 719m at the time.
European legislation would have forced disclosure two years from now, but
Lord Cairns, Warburg chief executive, said the group preferred to pick the
moment that suited it best to make the announcement.
Most of the larger UK merchant banks have now voluntarily disclosed their
secret reserves, a traditional tool used by banks to smooth out profits.
Warburg said it had never used secret reserves to bolster its profits,
though losses on Rolls-Royce in the mid-1970s and local authority swaps two
years ago had been set against these reserves. Had it maintained the
reserves this year, reported profits would have been Pounds 3m less.
The level of reserves, above most expectations, eased the mild
disappointment that the stock market felt at the group's performance in the
year to March 31. After reporting profits of Pounds 89m in the first half,
Warburg slipped to Pounds 77m in the second, due in particular to the lack
of corporate finance activity before the UK general election in April. It
had issued a profits warning in February.
Profits for the year as a whole were up by nearly a quarter from the
restated Pounds 135.2m of the previous year.
This was largely because of the spate of rights issues by UK companies in
the first half, followed by an international equity raising later in the
year, including the Pounds 5bn sell-off of BT shares by the government.
Mercury Asset Management, the majority-owned fund management group,
increased pre-tax profits from Pounds 56.4m to Pounds 65.1m.
Lord Cairns said: 'A large number of decisions were quite clearly being
deferred due to uncertainty about the election.'
The group managed a return on its enlarged disclosed reserves of 18.9 per
cent, up from a restated 16.4 per cent the year before and still well short
of the average 25 per cent it hopes to achieve in the long-term.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Frank words from French entrepreneur: Jean-Luc Lagardere of
Hachette and Matra talks to William Dawkins
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Jean-Luc Lagardere's image as one of France's top self-made men has recently
taken a knock, but he is as resilient as ever and swears his strategy
remains valid.
Mr Lagardere almost takes relish in countering the widespread criticism of
his latest scheme, which he argues has been poorly understood since being
unveiled earlier this month.
Unkind spirits have condemned the merger of the two companies he controls -
Matra, the transport, telecommunications and defence group, with Hachette,
France's leading international publisher - as panic.
Some see it as a way to use profitable Matra to pay for the FFr3.55bn
(Pounds 359.7m) losses clocked up by La Cinq, the now defunct television
station which Mr Lagardere bought for Hachette 18 months ago. The
64-year-old Mr Lagardere recognises this as the most serious setback in his
career.
Others see it as an eccentric attempt to find common interests between
unrelated businesses or a cynical attempt to fend off possible bids. Mr
Lagardere forcefully denies these claims.
'People take me for either an idiot or a hooligan. I believe I am neither
one nor the other,' he says. 'You don't tie someone with a broken leg to a
healthy person and expect them to go faster . . . I won't tell you that
there is a synergy between magazines and missiles . . . but that's not the
point.'
So what is the point? The big advantage of the merger is that it will allow
both sides to draw cashflow centrally for investments in each of the nine
activities in which they are jointly present, he says. There will be big
head office and administrative savings, but that is a secondary gain.
The project is in line with his mostly successful business strategy, Mr
Lagardere insists. He has always believed that any business that cannot
guarantee very high sales volumes must diversify to survive.
It must be ready to adapt, to take risks, close lossmakers when the risks
get too great, seek partners where it can no longer compete alone  - as
Matra is doing in telecommunications - and move into new areas. The merger
will help both groups by making them financially stronger and more flexible,
he argues.
'I have always been convinced that one cannot make a group live eternally on
a single product. You need an enormous effect of mass to do that . . . Look
at Dassault,' he says, referring to the aircraft group where he trained as a
designer of prototypes in the 1950s. 'Nobody could have succeeded better at
what they are doing, and yet they have not sold a single military aircraft
outside France for the past four years.'
Mr Lagardere's Dassault years marked him in all kinds of ways. His
engineering roots are evident in the way he sketches graphs to illustrate
his points. The experience also bought him into close contact with Matra,
then a single product company supplying missiles to Dassault, now much more
diversified with innovations including the Espace family and the VAL
automatic metro.
Matra's controlling shareholder invited him to take over as managing
director at the age of 34, which Mr Lagardere did on condition that he got
carte blanche. The same shareholder supported Mr Lagardere's takeover of
Hachette in 1980.
From the start, Mr Lagardere has been driven by two main impulses. First,
the urge to create a great company, which he attributes to a passion to
redress France's wartime humiliation; and second, the realisation that as an
entrepreneur he must take investment risks, but cut his losses if the
company's life is threatened. Clearly, he argues, multi-product companies
can spread risks more easily.
'When we took over La Cinq, it was losing money, but I reckoned that these
were not losses but investments. I have always said that once an investment
becomes a loss, it is time to cut. If I had continued with La Cinq in 1992,
the fatal risk for the group would have been real.' He points out that
Hachette will be easily recapitalised before the merger with Matra, so there
is no question of robbing the electronics group to bail out Hachette.
Neither was there any question of hoping that the French state would bail
out the television station. Mr Lagardere has always taken pride in belonging
to none of the political or financial power networks that bind corporate
France together. So he could expect no special favours. 'I have never
stepped into that world, never. I have always known how to work with the
establishment, but I keep my distance,' he says.
In other countries, a La Cinq-type disaster might have provoked the
resignation of the chairman. Yet Mr Lagardere has, if anything, strengthened
his position by putting the new merged group under the control of a societe
en commandite par actions, a share partnership in which the partners, headed
by Mr Lagardere, have unlimited personal liability for losses but are almost
unsackable. 'On the subject of resignation, even in England it's not so
simple . . . I used to have a motor racing team with Jackie Stewart as
driver. It happened that one day he lost a Grand Prix. But we didn't replace
him at the next race because he had won 10 previously.'
If chairmen were sacked every time they made a mistake, 'business would
become a game of massacre, in which those who succeeded would be the ones
who did nothing. My idea of business is that one must dare to take risks,'
he says. Mr Lagardere dislikes pressure for short-term performance,
something which he could produce by selling assets. 'Unlike some people who
I will not name, that is not my idea of entrepreneurship,' he says.
Suggestions that the commandite structure artificially protects management
overlook the fact that the partners' personal liabilities are very real, he
argues.
'For me, it is a profession of faith to make money and to stay independent .
. . Institutional shareholders should say to themselves that Lagardere is
obliged to make money, for all his personal fortune is in it. Unless he is
mad or a masochist, he must make money.'
Whether or not you believe his strategy of pooling his businesses to give
them the strength to diversify, Mr Lagardere is and will remain a driven
man.

SEDGWICK, the insurance broker, and Price Waterhouse, the accountants and
management consultants, are joining forces in a bid to help leading European
oil and gas companies form a new mutual insurance company.
The new mutual, which could have a capital base of more than Dollars 50m
(Pounds 28m) and a minimum of 15 members, would provide extra insurance
capacity in the specialist energy insurance market, where rates have
increased and capacity diminished following recent losses.
Since December, both Sedgwick and Price Waterhouse have conducted
feasibility studies and intend to hold more detailed discussions with their
clients within the next two weeks.
No company has yet agreed to join the proposed mutual, but both
organisations report a general feeling of support from their clients for the
concept.
'We believe the support is there. We are literally having clients say to us
'when can we have it?',' said Mr Chris Mundy, director of marketing at
Sedgwick Energy, the broker's specialist subsidiary.
'We would like to think we would be putting together a cast-iron proposal
within the next four to six weeks,' added Mr Mundy, who said that there was
an urgent need for action because of the contraction in available capacity.
Sedgwick's 200 clients include British Petroleum, Shell, Amerada Hess and
Mobil.
A number of oil majors which have North American interests are already part
of a mutual company, Oil Insurance Ltd (OIL), which was formed in the late
1960s.
Mr Richard Titley, chairman of Sedgwick Energy, said the new mutual would
'complement OIL by focusing on European assets.' Hit by losses such as the
explosion of the Piper Alpha rig in the North Sea in July 1988, specialist
energy insurers, including Lloyd's syndicates, have increased rates and
reduced the amount of cover available.
Oil companies, especially those in the North Sea, have massive insurance
exposures, sometimes in excess of Dollars 2bn.
Last year buyers faced rate increases of between 15 and 200 per cent, and
Sedgwick expects the tightness in the market to continue. 'Capacity is going
to be diminished,' added Mr Titley.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Major drops visa requirement for Polish tourists to Britain
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR announced the abolition of UK visa requirements for Polish
tourists yesterday and increased Britain's financial aid to Warsaw. The
gesture was designed to underline his commitment to Poland's eventual
membership of the European Community.
After talks with Polish government leaders in Warsaw, Mr Major said he would
use Britain's presidency of the EC in the second half of this year to commit
the 12 to allowing Poland, Czechoslovakia and Hungary to join the Community.
Mr Major said membership of the EC was not practical in the short term.
Poland is locked in twin political and economic crises, heightened last
night when President Lech Walesa declared that he had 'lost trust in the
present government'. All three countries are still suffering from the
painful transition to market-based economies.
Mr Major, however, emphasised his determination that the Community should
not remain a 'rich man's club', suggesting that the EC should set the turn
of the century as a firm target for their inclusion.
His announcement, after talks with Mr Walesa and Mr Jan Olszewski, the
Polish prime minister, that Britain will abolish visa requirements for
Polish visitors to the UK ended a long-running dispute between the two
governments. In the past, Britain has argued that, because of the large
Polish communities in the UK, many visitors have stayed on as illegal
workers.
Some 200,000 Poles are resident in the UK. Many have relatives in Poland who
want to visit. Complaints have centred on long delays in granting visas,
excessive bureaucracy, the number of people rejected and the charge for
visas, which at about Pounds 20 can be more than a week's wage in Poland.
Last year, 47,350 Poles applied for UK visas, and 5 per cent were turned
down.
The announcement was welcomed by Polish community organisations in the UK.
Mr Mieczyslaw Hampel, administrator of the Polish Social and Cultural
Association in London, said: 'In general we are very pleased'.
Mr Antoni Zniderycz, secretary of a branch of the Polish Ex-Combatants
Association, said: 'Our main argument was that we who stayed by the side of
England for many years during the war were the first to deserve that
kindness from the British government.'
Mr Hampel expressed some worries that young people might exploit the
relaxation to work illegally, but other leaders played this down. 'If
anything it would be a short-term problem, not a long-term problem.
Everybody knows there is unemployment in this country,' said Mr Alojzy
Gajdzik, chairman of the Polish Parish in south-east London.
Mr Major flew to Prague last night on the second leg of his four-day tour of
central Europe. At a joint press conference earlier with Mr Olszewski, he
indicated that he intended to press for a much stronger political dialogue
between Poland, Hungary and Czechslovakia and the EC.
Foreign ministers from the three countries will be invited to a meeting of
the EC council and the three heads of government will attend joint talks in
London during the British presidency.
Mr Major said the UK would increase financial aid for Poland by Dollars 14m.
The money will finance small business development.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community's position at next week's Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro looks set to fall well short of what environment commissioner Carlo
Ripa di Meana has proposed, and his own attendance at the summit was last
night in doubt.
Environment ministers of the 12 yesterday agreed to sign the Climate Change
convention due to be agreed in Rio.
But they did not agree to endorse politically the European Commission's plan
to tax energy as a means of curbing carbon dioxide emissions, even though no
EC state opposed the proposal.
Nor were they able to agree on a timetable for nearly doubling development
aid to a minimum of 0.7 per cent of gross domestic product to help
developing countries adopt more environmentally sound development
strategies.
Taken together, this is a limp posture when set against what Mr Ripa de
Meana had defined as the minimum 'dowry' the Community should take to Rio.
The Commission's plan is to stabilise CO emissions at 1990 levels by 2000,
through an energy tax equivalent to Dollars 10 a barrel of oil equivalent.
Mr Ripa di Meana says the EC can only deliver half that target without a
tax.
The plan won strong support yesterday from Germany, Denmark, the
Netherlands, Luxembourg and Italy. The first four attacked the Commission
for making introduction of the tax conditional on the US and Japan adopting
similar measures.
Spain, Portugal and Greece insisted that conditionality was vital to protect
EC industry.
France and the UK reserved their position behind procedure, since the
Commission overshot its deadline in producing the detailed draft directive,
which it will look at today.
'The UK position remains that when we see it, we will study it in detail,'
Mr Michael Howard, UK environment secretary, said of the tax plan.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Letter: Fund's financing too low fully to realise east
Europe objectives
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ROGER GARSIDE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, visits Czechoslovakia, Hungary
and Poland this week, he may see something of what Britain is doing, through
the Know-how Fund, to help build institutions at the heart of their
economies. Because the transformation of these countries entails massive
disruption, the strength of these fledgling institutions will be severely
tried in the years ahead. If they do not stand the strain, the consequences
will not be limited to central Europe.
In all three countries, the Know-how Fund has been so successful in
attracting good projects and so quick in approving them that its budget is
stretched to its limit and, in one case, beyond that limit. This is a
tribute to a good concept, well administered. But justified pride should not
mask the fact that the present level of financing is too low.
When Mr Major speaks to his hosts of political co-operation between their
governments and the EC, his words will ring hollow if he cannot assure them
that the Know-how Fund will be increased to a level commensurate with the
economic risks to their political stability and our responsibilities as a
nation that did so much to inspire the reforms they have undertaken.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ARCHIE KIDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Having commendably recommended diesel engined cars because of their
higher fuel efficiency ('Motoring: Diesels for sensible ecologists', May
23), Stuart Marshall's assertion that a car with automatic transmission 'is
ideal for the 1990s' is a complete contradiction of what a 'sensible
ecologist' should go for.
It has long been known that automatic transmission consumes 7 to 8 per cent
more power than a car with manual exchange. Unless there is some health or
medical reason for saving the driver the minute effort of using a gear
lever, surely the great majority of drivers at all interested in saving the
environment from unnecessary pollution and in minimising consumption of
irreplaceable fuel should avoid this expensive and unnecessary luxury.
Using, say, a pint of fuel per hour to obviate such a very slight personal
effort seems to me to be nothing short of an ecological crime.

<TEXT>
Sir, Philip Stephens's description of Labour MPs who voted against the
Maastricht Bill as '61 of the party's Euro-sceptics' is an unresearched
generalisation ('Tories shrug off backbench revolt on Maastricht', May 22).
I voted against and am by no means a Euro-sceptic - quite the reverse. I
voted against because the 'British version' of the treaty seeks to create a
Europe which pays no attention to the social needs and the employment rights
of ordinary workers employed or unemployed. In fact, it negates the clear
implications in the change of title from European Economic Community to
European Community. That is not the sort of Europe I want to see. The
interests of most of my constituents focus on the Social Chapter 'which in
our case we have not got'.
Our European colleagues have all got a much better deal - the deal that I
want for Britain. I voted against the Bill because I am a Euro-enthusiast,
not a Euro-sceptic and I believe more than a few of my new colleagues did
the same.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Foreign Affairs: Bosnia's tragic example - Security
arrangements in Europe underpin renewed international interest in
Yugoslavia's civil war
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD MORTIMER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
You might think, from public statements made in the past two days by
American and European statesmen, that their top priority was doing something
effective to halt the fighting in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Speaking in Lisbon on Sunday, Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, was
eloquent on the subject: 'There are 35,000 diabetics now who have no
insulin. There are 6,000 women and babies who have no medicine, baby formula
or milk . . . Anyone who is looking for a reason not to act, or arguing
somehow that action in the face of this kind of nightmare is not warranted
at this time . . . is on the wrong wavelength.' This from a man who
stalwartly refused to contemplate any kind of sanctions against Iraq before
August 2 1990, in spite of evidence that Saddam Hussein was guilty of
chemical warfare and other gross violations of human rights; a man famous
for staying all of seven minutes in south-eastern Turkey in April 1991, when
it was flooded with Kurdish refugees.
By Monday, Mr John Major had taken up the theme, calling on the EC to take
measures against Serbia well beyond a token protest. Meanwhile, the
Portuguese foreign minister had promised that the EC would 'not allow those
responsible for the bloodshed to go unpunished', and Mr Klaus Kinkel, the
new German foreign minister, dotted the i: 'It must be said clearly who is
responsible. The Serbians are responsible.'
No doubt that is true. Reporters on the spot are certain that Serbian
militias in Bosnia are working in tight collusion both with Serbia itself
and with the Yugoslav army, to achieve exclusive Serb control of about
two-thirds of the republic's territory and expel the other ethnic
communities.
'Ethnic cleansing' is the euphemism for this procedure, which has been
applied also in the Serb-controlled areas of Croatia, and to a smaller
extent by the Croats in areas that they control. But of course it was not
invented by either Serbs or Croats. The Armenians are doing the same in
Nagorno-Karabakh. The Turks did it in northern Cyprus. The Israelis did it
in parts of Palestine in 1948, and again on a smaller scale in 1967. The
Czechs did it in the Sudetenland, the Poles in Silesia, Pomerania and East
Prussia, after 1945. Greeks and Turks did it to each other in 1922-3. Ever
since ethnicity began to be invoked as a basis of statehood, people trying
to build or preserve states in disputed areas have been tempted, as a last
resort, to clear those areas by force of people whose ethnic identity
renders their loyalty suspect.
Mr Baker and his European 'allies' are right to be horrified, but it is
doubtful whether any of them really believe they can stop it. 'We are really
talking about the need - maybe - to do something next time,' says an unnamed
US official quoted in the international press. 'Everyone in the loop
concedes that Yugoslavia is a past case already.'
It is an unworthy thought, but difficult to resist once it has occurred to
you, that the argument is not really about what should be done in the former
Yugoslavia but about future security arrangements in Europe. It was perhaps
no coincidence that this heightened awareness of the horrors of war in
Yugoslavia hit the headlines on the very day that France and Germany agreed
to push ahead with their proposal for a 35,000-man joint army corps,
intended to be the nucleus of a future European army.
It was last Friday, remember, that President Francois Mitterrand and
Chancellor Helmut Kohl made their announcement in La Rochelle, and it was
that very night that Mr Baker, after conferring with Mr Major, suddenly
called on 'the civilised world' to start thinking about political,
diplomatic and economic action against Serbia, and then added: 'If measures
in those fields should fail, then and only then it would be my view to take
a look at questions involving military matters.'
The beauty of this formulation is that it raises the possibility of military
action only when other measures have been tried and failed. By then, of
course, the Serbs would have more or less completed their 'ethnic
cleansing', and might even value the arrival of a 'peacekeeping force' which
would make it more difficult for armed Croats or Moslems to infiltrate the
'cleansed' area. The Turks have found a UN force very useful for that
purpose in Cyprus, and it was clearly in that spirit that the Serbs agreed
to have one in Croatia - although they are now in trouble with the UN for
trying to finish off the 'cleansing' operation after the UN troops arrived.
To be really cynical, one could argue that the prevention of ethnic
cleansing is a task unachievable by any military intervention short of a
full-scale occupation and administration, but that ethnic cleansing itself
is a useful, perhaps even essential, precondition for a successful
'peacekeeping' operation, which classically involves the interposition of a
neutral force along a clear line of demarcation between two sides.
Now think back to last summer, when the fighting in Yugoslavia started.
Victory in the Gulf War had reasserted the US's military supremacy and
indispensability, but the Europeans, aided by US public opinion, had bounced
President Bush into intervening in Kurdistan, from which he was trying to
extricate his troops as fast as possible. Meanwhile the Europeans were
wrangling among themselves and with their Nato allies about the
institutional framework for closer European defence cooperation: should it
come under Nato or should it be an aspect of the new European Union? In
other words, should America have a say in it or not?
Yugoslavia was no longer a stake in the cold war, and the US concluded it
was an area of limited strategic interest, where involvement carried
significant risks but offered few worthwhile benefits. The Europeans were
proclaiming a new 'common foreign and security policy'. Let them try their
luck.
The Europeans tried, with the results we now see. Meanwhile a compromise was
reached, at the Nato summit in Rome last November and then at Maastricht in
December, on European defence: it would be done through the Western European
Union (WEU), which was to be both 'an integral part of the development of
the European Union', and 'a means to strengthen the European pillar of the
Atlantic Alliance' - the latter remaining 'the essential forum for
consultation among its members'.
Although the French and German governments insist that their joint corps,
which other WEU members are invited to join, will 'contribute to the
reinforcement of the Atlantic alliance,' it is clearly regarded by the US,
and by the British and Dutch, as a breach of the spirit of last year's
compromise.
That is why it is such a good moment for the US to rub Europe's nose in the
reality of its political incompetence and military irrelevance, by drawing
attention to a crisis it has conspicuously failed to solve, and by hinting
at a military intervention which, without Nato's help, it would be quite
unable to organize.
Yet I wonder if it is a wise thing to do. When Europeans have had time to
think about it, they may decide to take the task of building a force which
would be less dependent on the US more seriously.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Letter: Banking practice is not a 'sham'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr ABDULKADER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your rather gratuitous quotation ('Islamic bank opens in Jakarta', May
15) of a 'local banker' that profit payments by Indonesia's new Islamic bank
are 'a sham' is very much unappreciated.
A newspaper of your quality surely has many qualified staff who are aware
that the issue for Moslems is not what conventional bankers consider to be
interest, but what Allah considers to be 'riba'.
Interest as paid in the normal course of most bank loans and deposits is,
indeed, riba.
But, here in America, Moslems find that a number of transactions are riba
free, and yet still defined as interest by authorities. For instance, were I
to sell goods on consignment at a profit, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS)
would define the profit as interest. Or were I to lease equipment to a
manufacturer under an Islamically acceptable lease, my accountant would
define my income to the IRS as 'interest'. In neither case would there be an
iota of riba, a stain of sham. I could cite many more examples.
Let's see what services Bank Muamalat Indonesia offers, and then we will
have a basis for judging whether or not they are a sham. I suspect that they
will not be a sham. Please don't cast aspersions unnecessarily.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Letter: London as financial centre of EC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr EDWARD DE BONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, If London is to have any hope of becoming the EC financial centre there
is no more than a four-week window of opportunity to clear up the Lloyd's
mess. The Council of Lloyd's is caught in a cruel dilemma. If the LMX spiral
practices are legal and defended as such then the effect will be even more
disastrous than if they are declared illegal.
The sheer inequity of this practice will soon be obvious to all. It cannot
be kept hidden that the LMX 'pyramid' process is flagrantly to the benefit
of the brokers (and Lloyd's indirectly) at the expense of the Names.
Condoning this practice, even if legal, will mean that the traditions of the
City of London render it unacceptable as a financial centre because
exploitation is not sufficiently ruled out.
It is also very likely that the 1982 Lloyd's Act will be challenged in the
European Courts of Justice as being contrary to basic human rights. To
expect Lloyd's to regulate itself is like asking turkeys to regulate
Christmas. The case will be an acute embarrassment to the government, which
will be put in the impossible position of having to condone dubious
practices. At this point it will become obvious that London is not fit to be
the financial centre of Europe. Allowing turkeys to behave as ostriches will
not solve the dilemma. It may just not be too late for resolute action by
the government. Inquiries that are too late in reporting are not sufficient
resolute action.

FT  27 MAY 92 / The strain and pain in Spain: The path to convergence with
leading EC economies is tough
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If Spaniards thought that their transition to democracy in 1977, their entry
into the European Community in 1986 and the growth of the economy ahead of
the single market next year entitled them to enjoy the fruits of success,
they are now being disabused of the idea.
Tomorrow, a half-day general strike will probably shut the country down.
Another full-day stoppage is planned for October. The nation's political
pulse has suddenly quickened as the government, having dawdled through its
third term until now, has launched a raft of policies to lock the country
more tightly into Europe - policies that directly threaten the political
power of Spain's trade unions.
Their focus is convergence with the leading Community economies and the
government's determination that Spain becomes a founding member of European
economic and monetary union in 1997 or, at the latest, 1999. Spain wants to
be a founder member because it fears that otherwise it will be left behind
in the second tier of European development, along with Greece and Portugal.
To get there, Spaniards are being asked to make another huge social and
economic effort and, for the unions at least, the price is too high. For its
part the government is certain that it has the country on its side.
'Spain now has an historic opportunity to form part of a process of
political integration in the most developed, rich and, maybe, the most
socially advanced part of the world,' said Mr Carlos Solchaga, the finance
minister, to parliament recently.
Convergence with strictly defined macroeconomic criteria was the centrepiece
of the Maastricht Treaty in December. To join the founders of Emu, Spain has
to cut public-sector deficits from 4.4 per cent to 3 per cent of gross
domestic product; bring long-term interest rates to within two points of the
lowest in the EC; take the peseta into the narrow band of the European
Monetary System's exchange rate mechanism by 1994; hold public-sector debt
below 60 per cent of GDP; and cut inflation to within 1.5 points of the
three best performers in the EC.
Spain's public debt as a percentage of GDP is one of the lowest in the
Community, but it faces an uphill battle against inflation, which has risen
from an annual 5.5 per cent at the end of 1991 to 6.5 per cent now. Worse,
last year's public-sector deficit of Dollars 25bn is being fuelled by
spending on infrastructure and social provisions such as health and
education by both the central government and the country's 17 autonomous
regions. The government's need to borrow is, in turn, the chief cause of the
country's high real interest rates, now hovering at about 6 per cent.
For Mr Solchaga, the prime minister's commitment to Maastricht has been a
blessing. The finance minister has for years been keen to cut deficit growth
and to discipline the economy. More often than not, he has been prevented
from doing so by the left-wingers who dominate the Socialist party
administration.
Now Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the prime minister, has been told bluntly by his
finance minister that unless Spain radically cuts spending, it will not be
able to meet Maastricht's convergence targets. For a man who has dedicated
10 years in government to putting Spain at the EC's top table, not
converging is a shocking prospect. He appears to have given Mr Solchaga
carte blanche to achieve his goal.
By March, Mr Solchaga had his Convergence Plan ready. He had two main
targets: the country's employment agency, Inem, and the body that
administers the national health system, Insalud.
In the past three years Inem, which runs unemployment offices and pays
benefits, accumulated a deficit of Dollars 4bn, which was due to rise to
Dollars 6bn by the end of this year. As economic activity has slowed,
employers are not renewing the short-term job contracts introduced by the
government in 1985. The number of people eligible for benefits has increased
sharply. Less than a week after publishing his Convergence Plan, Mr Solchaga
decreed sharp cuts in the amount of unemployment benefits payable and
doubled the time required to qualify for benefits to a year.
The measures could save Dollars 4bn this year but the unions have responded
with a programme of strikes and increasingly vitriolic verbal assaults on
the government. In the words of one union leader: 'It is the biggest attack
ever on the workers by a democratic Spanish government.'
On the healthcare front, Mr Solchaga also plans to implement sweeping
reforms of a system that has overspent its budgets by a total of Dollars 6bn
since 1988. Notably, the civil servants who manage the budgets are to become
contracted executives who, for the first time, will face dismissal if they
do not meet financial targets.
Insalud, the central buying monopoly for the hospitals, is to be run as a
business and will be phased out as health planning is devolved to regional
governments. Unions see the moves to streamline health administration as a
first step to privatising it.
Together, the Inem and Insalud deficits account for more than 1 per cent of
GDP and the attack on them is fundamental to Mr Solchaga's Convergence Plan.
But he has also infuriated the left and the unions by establishing goals
that go beyond Maastricht's requirements. Where Emu says public deficits
should be lower than 3 per cent of GDP, Mr Solchaga has committed Spain to 1
per cent.
The finance minister's fervour stems from a fear of two things. First, the
possibility that Emu may not happen in the light of German worries over
giving up the D-Mark; second, his long experience of his party increasing
spending ahead of elections. By the end of 1994 Spaniards will have voted in
municipal, regional, general and European elections.
For Mr Solchaga, these two factors mean 'the government is doing no more
than any responsible government would do, even without Maastricht'.
It was inevitable that the unions would oppose the programme. As a result, a
united stance by the Socialist party is crucial. To achieve this, Mr
Gonzalez has been forced to breathe life back into the political fortunes of
the deputy party leader, Mr Alfonso Guerra. He resigned as deputy prime
minister last year in the wake of a scandal involving political favours to
his businessman brother in Seville.
Mr Guerra has always had a tight hold on party organisation, and his power
has rested in his ability to control the nominations of election candidates.
A general election must be held by October next year and Mr Gonzalez seems
to have made a simple trade. Mr Guerra will be allowed to manage the
election in return for ensuring party solidarity behind convergence.
Both Mr Gonzalez and Mr Solchaga have publicly hinted that they would rather
lose their parliamentary majority than forego the Convergence Plan. Against
this, union efforts to mobilise support against the Socialists seem doomed.
'There is a risk,' says Mr Nicolas Sartorius, a leader of the United Left
(IU) party, the biggest of the left-wing parties, 'that the strikes may
backfire'. Public transport strikes in Madrid and Barcelona in the spring
irritated the public, while the decree on unemployment benefits has excluded
a much abused scheme that pays benefits to unemployed farm workers in the
regions of Andalucia and Extremadura. This scheme virtually captures the
large rural vote in these regions for the government.
The problem the unions have in trying to generate sympathy is that the
context in which the benefit cuts have been made is convergence, and the
idea of becoming a leader in Europe is popular in Spain. The unions have
thus been forced to try to win support over two tangential threats. The
first is a strike law which will restrict union freedom to call and
implement strikes; the second has been a decision by the government to
freeze all subsidies to public sector companies at current levels.
The unions are not alone in the firing line of reform. Mr Solchaga also has
the professions and the trades in his sights. Prices in the service sector
are rising at roughly double the rate of inflation and he is looking for
ways to strip away protective traditions which fix fees and entry into many
occupations.
If Mr Solchaga's overall strategy sounds bold, the government is confident
that it has adequate public backing, particularly from the growing numbers
of Spaniards who count themselves as middle class. In 1985, for example, 39
per cent of polled Spaniards said they were middle class. By last summer,
that figure had risen to 51 per cent.
The government, then, is playing to the economic and European aspirations of
a majority of voters, and the only criticism it will listen to now comes
from economists sceptical of its ability to put the Convergence Plan into
practice.
Mr Jaime de Pinies, chief economist at the merchant bank Banco Santander de
Negocios, says he believes 1992 and 1993 will be 'low credibility years' for
the plan. An election is looming and Mr Solchaga will be under great
pressure not to cut spending too much. Also, the plan requires Spain to grow
faster than the Community average, while committing it to cutting inflation
and deficits in the absence of any real signs of an international economic
upturn.
Although wage settlements are averaging about 7.5 per cent this year - a
full point down on 1991 - several economists wonder whether Mr Solchaga may
have bitten off more than he can chew. 'The achievement of these objectives
(3 per cent inflation by 1996 and a public deficit of 1 per cent of GDP)
seem far from realistic, and carry an important sacrifice in terms of
employment and real economic growth,' said a recent report by the
Madrid-based Analistas Financieros Internacionales.
Mr Solchaga, though, has one and a half tricks up his sleeve to counter the
pessimism. Peseta entry into the narrow band of the ERM would require cuts
in interest rates, and could encourage exports and stimulate the economy.
The half trick is a Spanish invention called cohesion.
At Maastricht, Spain managed to persuade its partners to create a 'cohesion'
fund to channel extra Community funds to poor member countries seeking to
restructure their economies. It was agreed this would be established by
1994. Madrid is now battling to bring the date forward to the end of this
year.
However, Mr Gonzalez will need all his charm to get this money flowing
Spain's way in the face of German and British opposition. 'We need this
money,' says Mr Carlos Westendorp, the minister for Europe. Smooth
convergence depends on it coming through.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Mr Lamont's objective
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RE-ELECTION of the Conservatives did not resolve the dilemmas of British
economic policy. It merely changed the time horizon. The government is now
able to take a strategic perspective. Such a perspective would be
unnecessary if there were no choices left to make. But there are a few, even
if the unmentionables - leaving the ERM or a realignment of sterling - are
ignored. With sterling in the wide bands, the government can vary interest
rates a little and public spending and taxation rather more. The question is
what to do with its freedom.
The chancellor of the exchequer has given his answer. He told the annual
dinner of the Confederation of British Industry last week that Britain
should aim to match Japan's inflation performance, which is about 2 per
cent, if it wants to be 'a first-rank commercial power'. This sounds very
attractive. But one might ask whether a current account deficit of Pounds
3.2bn in the first four months of 1992, for much of which the economy was in
the seventh successive quarter of decline, is consistent with being a
'first-rank commercial power'.
The official view is that the external position of a country is of no
significance. Since the authorities also argued that the monetary expansion
between 1986 and 1988 was a private phenomenon of limited policy concern,
this view is not convincing. A 'first rate commercial power' in recession,
but with a current account deficit, probably needs a real exchange rate
depreciation. With realignments ruled out, low inflation is the sole route
to that goal. Mr Lamont's target for inflation is not mere hubris. It is a
goal that must be achieved, the sooner the better.
Necessary pain
This suggests that the high interest rates of today, not to mention efforts
to put public spending back under control, represent necessary pain. So
should Mr Lamont whisper sotto voce thanks for the monetary consequences of
German unification and watch as British inflation - now merely back to where
it was before the Lawson boom - is slowly dragged down to respectable
levels? After all, under today's 5 per cent underlying rate of inflation,
sterling would lose three quarters of its purchasing power in 30 years. This
is not respectable.
His choice is not so simple. What has made the disinflationary process
effective is also what makes it so dangerous: the consequences of high
interest rates on an economy whose banks, property companies and households
took a huge bet on inflation not so many years ago. Mountleigh is the
latest, but certainly not the last casualty from that period.
Debt deflation
There is only one answer to debt deflation: low short term interest rates,
the answer supplied by the Federal Reserve in the US. But the sluggish US
recovery suggests that a powerful debt deflation can only be overcome by a
far more aggressive central bank than anything on offer in the UK.
So what should the government choose: as much monetary restraint as
possible, to get inflation down, or as little as possible, to get the
economy moving again?
Lower interest rates do appear desirable. Disinflation is in train, whatever
happens to interest rates in the short to medium term. Maybe interest rates
can even fall a sliver below German levels, which are themselves unlikely to
fall for quite a while. High German interest rates do at least virtually
guarantee that the loosening in the UK will not be overdone.
Yet whatever the government now chooses, the legacy it inherits from its own
and its predecessor's errors ensures that the outcome will be unhappy:
underlying inflation will not fall as fast as the government hopes; recovery
will not be as strong as it might wish. More important still, even when
underlying inflation has at last been driven down to low levels, strong
growth may well not ensue.
Like the British public, the government has taken a gamble. The public bet
on inflation. The government has bet on the ERM. It has bet that the weak
balance of payments position will not constrain future growth; it has bet as
well that a heavily indebted economy will return to health despite high real
interest rates. Only time will tell whether the gamble will work. Even a
newly re-elected government can only do a little more than hope.

VENDETTA: American Express and the smearing of Edmond Safra By Bryan
Burrough HarperCollins Dollars 25 hardback, 477 pages
HOUSE OF CARDS: Inside the Troubled Empire of American Express By Jon
Friedman &amp; John Meehan GP Putnam &amp; Sons Dollars 24.95, 262 pages
During the 1980s few US companies enjoyed such rapid profits growth and
success as American Express. And few company chairmen were as lionised as
Jim Robinson, the soft-spoken and courtly Atlanta banker's son who moved
effortlessly between Wall Street and Washington.
After being named chairman in 1977 Mr Robinson appeared to be constructing a
financial services supermarket as he steered American Express from one
acquisition to another.
To the company's traditional charge card and travellers cheque products were
added an array of sister businesses that ranged from stockbroking and
investment banking (Shearson Loeb Rhoades, Lehman Brothers, E F Hutton) to
private and commercial banking (Mr Edmond Safra's Trade Development Bank) to
the cable television business (Warner Amex Cable).
The good times for American Express coincided with the rise of the
free-spending yuppies in the 1980s. Consumer spending kept rising - and with
it the number of holders of the Amex green card, the gold card, and even the
platinum card - until the company had some 36m cardholders worldwide.
But American Express began facing a far harsher environment at the end of
the decade. In retrospect, its once grand strategy now seemed more an ad hoc
series of opportunistic acquisitions that had produced an unwieldy
conglomerate. Its purchase of E F Hutton in late 1987, for example, came
shortly after the Wall Street crash and led to heavy 1990 losses at Shearson
Lehman Hutton.
The new Optima card, a downmarket venture in the credit card sector, was by
Amex's own admission poorly managed. By 1991 Optima was mired in credit
losses. By early 1992 - after a year in which Optima accounted for more than
50 per cent of the Dollars 697m rise in credit loss provisions in the card
division - Amex admitted its need to strengthen its capital base.
Worse still, the core business of cards had been affected not only by the
Optima losses but by rising numbers of retailers who were steering customers
away from the Amex card and protesting the company's high fee structure.
For Mr Robinson it must all seem like a bad dream.
Critics say his 1980s diversification strategy has begun to disintegrate:
the cable business was disposed of in 1985, just before it turned
profitable.
In 1984, a year after the purchase of Trade Development Bank, Mr Safra had
broken with Amex (TDB itself was sold in 1990). And in 1989 Mr Robinson had
to make a humbling public apology and a donation of Dollars 8m to Mr Safra's
favourite charities when it emerged that persons employed by Amex had
engaged in a smear campaign against Mr Safra.
Now, as Mr Robinson and American Express are coming in for criticism over
the company's business strategy in US media and financial circles, two new
books add to the controversy. Yet neither provides enough analysis to answer
the key question: what really went wrong?
The first to be published is a chronologically ordered narrative called
House of Cards. The book tries to present itself as an expose of Mr
Robinson, who is dismissed as a power-hungry lightweight. However, the book
is superficial and at times gratuitously salacious.
This is a shame because House of Cards might have been - had it contained a
bit more analysis - a more authoritative look at a fascinating company that
lately has seemed to be somewhat adrift.
Vendetta is another story. This is a well written and heavily detailed
account of the way in which some distinctly unsalubrious operatives were
deployed in the late 1980s by an aide to Mr Robinson to investigate Mr
Safra. Vendetta recounts how they ended up smearing the secretive
Swiss-based banker, thus costing Amex an enormous amount in terms of image
and reputation.
Vendetta has brought Bryan Burrough, author of the best-selling Barbarians
at the Gate, a Dollars 50m libel suit from the former aide to Mr Robinson
who eventually resigned because the Safra affair occurred 'on my watch'. The
libel suit, however, does not concern the book, but rather an article
published by Burrough in The Wall Street Journal.
The book's great strength is as a colourful yarn that chronicles some
questionable behaviour committed in the name of an otherwise reputable US
corporation. Its weakness is that it hints at Mr Robinson's direct
involvement in the Safra affair, but never quite manages to make the charge
stick.
The real value of both books is less in their revelations than in their
underscoring of the problems that have caused Mr Robinson and Amex to come
under such scrutiny. Mr Robinson may yet put things right, but for now the
company's image - perhaps its most precious asset - looks somewhat
tarnished.

A promising evening. BBC2 continues its series of five-minute Dance House

the Pet Shop Boys (7.55). Channel 4's consumer series Check Out 92 returns
with a programme which asks why, even after the recommendations following
the 1985 Manchester air disaster, safety measures which have been understood
for decades (rear facing seats for example) are still, apparently, being
ignored by the Civil Aviation Authority (8.30).
In the week before Czechoslovakia's general election, Dispatches reviews the
state of the country's economy and discovers that many of those now running
large businesses were communist bosses not long ago (9.00 C4).
BBC2's re-run of the drama about politics, Edge of Darkness reaches its
penultimate episode (9.25). Inside Story offers what sounds like a harrowing
documentary about Baragwanath Hospital in the South African black township
of Soweto where 100 victims of assault arrive every night (9.30) BBC1).

FT  27 MAY 92 / Business and the Environment: Regional issues get support
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
As world leaders prepare to discuss global environmental problems at the
Earth Summit in Rio, the UK government has been told by its Advisory
Committee on Science and Technology (Acost) to focus environmental research
more on local and regional issues.
An Acost review of UK environmental research programmes concludes that the
concentration of funds on global issues such as climate change 'could starve
initiatives in other areas'.
Acost recommends 'a move over time to greater focus on local and regional
issues, many of which are pressing problems (for instance, waste management
and land remediation)'.
It points out that huge sums will be spent tackling local pollution over the
next decade - for example Pounds 28bn by the UK water industry - and says
'research could produce cheaper or better ways of improving these local and
regional environmental problems'.
Total public spending on environmental research is Pounds 200m a year on a
narrow definition - and as much as Pounds 400m a year on a very wide
definition. The lower figure would represent 5 per cent of total government
R&amp;D, a similar level to other industrialised countries.
The biggest single area of spending is the physics of the global atmosphere,
which consumes about Pounds 55m a year. Total spending on water pollution,
including oceans and seas, lakes and rivers, amounts to Pounds 40m.
At present much environmental research focuses on the scientific processes
that determine the system being studied. As these become better understood,
Acost says, the emphasis should switch to investigating the specific impact
of changes on the environment and remedial measures that can be taken to
combat undesirable changes.
The report was written by an Acost committee chaired by Robert May,
professor of zoology at Oxford University.

FT  27 MAY 92 / The Week In Luxembourg: Milking the Community cow - European
Court
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Dairy farmers who were paid a premium by the European Community to take a
five-year holiday from milk production are entitled to damages for lost
income they would have received during the period under the EC additional
milk levy quota, the European Court of Justice (ECJ) ruled last week.
The Court said the Community must compensate the farmers because they had
accepted a temporary EC non-marketing premium for a period chosen by Dutch
and German authorities under 1984 EC milk rules which the ECJ had already
ruled invalid because they breach Community law on protection of legitimate
expectations.
The ECJ held that the Community had incurred liability because of its
failure to take account of the specific situation of the producers affected
without invoking any higher public interest.
The extent of damage to be compensated was the loss of income that would
otherwise have been earned. Income earned from alternative occupations had
to be deducted in mitigation. Interest was awarded at the rate claimed but
at a maximum of 8 per cent.
The farmers were not entitled to further damages under a 1989 amendment to
the milk rules which allowed producers a provisional quota. Although the
1989 amendment was equally invalid, the breach of EC law on protection of
legitimate expectations was not sufficiently serious to entitle them to
compensation because the Community legislature had considered all relevant
interests in making its legitimate economic policy choice.
All dairy farmers in the same situation as those in last week's test cases
will be entitled to claim damages caused by invalid EC rules on the
additional milk levy quota introduced in 1984, but not for any loss caused
by the failure of the 1989 rules to allocate sufficient quota.
However, those involved have as much as a year to agree the calculation of
the amount of damages, in accordance with principles laid down by the Court.
So while final adjudication in the event of disagreement is reserved to the
Court, further delay and complications are likely before any dairy farmers
are compensated.
Mulder and others v Council and Commission, Joined Cases C-104/89 and
C-37/90, FC, 19 May 1992.
Last Friday, ECJ president Ole Due refused the European Commission's
application for interim measures against the UK in a case concerning the
scope of the monopoly enjoyed under EC law by the five UK Milk Marketing
Boards (MMBs) over 'milk produced and marketed without processing'.
The UK says the monopoly covers all forms of liquid milk for direct human
consumption including skimmed and semi-skimmed milk. The Commission
disagrees, claiming that the MMBs' exclusive rights are limited to whole
milk.
The ECJ president, who customarily decides interim measures cases alone, did
not examine the merits of the dispute, rejecting the Commission's
application on the ground of lack of urgency.
In particular, he held that the milk producers concerned had sufficient
safeguards that the status quo would be maintained until judgment by the
full court without danger of serious and irreparable damage. He accepted
undertakings by the MMBs not to enforce any rights over skimmed or
semi-skimmed milk until the ECJ's final decision.
Commission v UK, Case C-40/92 R, Order of the President of the Court, 22 May
1992.
Permissible national controls - auditors
The ECJ has delivered another significant judgment for the professions, and
in particular auditors, building on earlier indications of the kind of
national controls which member states may impose on individuals or companies
established in one member state when they provide services or are engaged as
employees in a second member state.
In accordance with EC rules on establishment, an auditor authorised to
practise in Luxembourg under Luxembourg law, and employed by an authorised
Luxembourg company, may not have his authorisation removed simply on the
ground that he no longer satisfies the condition of Luxembourg law which
restricts authorisation to auditors established in Luxembourg, when he moves
his centre of operations to Germany, and is employed by a German company
related to his Luxembourg employer.
However, the Rome Treaty rules on free movement of workers and freedom to
provide services permit Luxembourg to require the auditor to comply with
certain rules which can be objectively justified in the public interest and
are equally applicable to Luxembourg auditors, if the requirements in the
member state where he is established are not equivalent.
In the current case, this meant that, within its own territory, Luxembourg
could require compliance with rules objectively necessary to ensure
professional rules applicable to auditors are observed, and require an
effective presence and a permanent infrastructure in Luxembourg as well as
the supervision of an auditor's compliance with professional ethics.
Ramrath v Minister of Justice, Case C-106/91, 6CH 20 May 1992.
Cheaper German roads
The ECJ had condemned a German law, previously suspended in 1990 by interim
order of the Court, increasing the tax imposed on heavy lorries using
Federal roads.
The tax was held to infringe the Rome Treaty's 'standstill' rule prohibiting
the introduction of new road transport measures with the direct or indirect
effect of discriminating against transport from other member states.
The discrimination resulted from the fact that, while German road hauliers
were subject to the same increase, they received a reduction in motor
vehicle tax which was not shared by those from other member states.
This judgment will save road hauliers of all member states the additional
costs when crossing Germany, in particular, to eastern Europe.
Commission v Germany, Case C-195/90, FC 19 May 1992.
Other cases
In four cases of less general significance, the ECJ rejected cases brought
by Greece challenging the clearance of its 1987 CAP accounts (Case C-385/89)
and by the Commission against Germany unsuccessfully claiming that German
rules infringed the Treaty rules on free movement of goods by applying
stricter rules to eye drops as a result of defining them as medicinal
products instead of as cosmetics (Case C-290/90).
The court upheld the Commission in finding that the Netherlands had failed
to implement correctly, within the time laid down, the 1982 directive on
risks of certain big industrial accidents (Case C-190/90) as well as
interpreting certain terms in the directive on the treatment of employees in
the case of the transfer of undertakings in the special context of certain
Dutch social work foundations (Case C-29/91).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A contract worth about Pounds 1m has been won by RACAL RADIO, Reading,
Berkshire, to supply and install the main HF radio system for use along the
full length of the Tazama oil pipeline in Africa.
Funded by the African Development Bank, the contract was awarded to Racal by
Tazama Pipeline following an international competitive tender.
The order calls for the supply and installation of eight 1kW HF radio
systems for voice and data transmission, including Group 3 fax, with the hub
station located at N'dola, Zambia. Refurbishment of antennas and training
support are also part of the package.
The systems to be supplied are Racal Adaptive Communications Equipment
(RACE), with an HF installation being located at the six pumping stations
along the pipeline and at the main control installations at each end. The
pipeline runs a total distance of 1,710 kilometres from the port of
Dar-es-Salaam, Tanzania, to the refinery at N'dola.
The Tazama eight-system HF network requirement forms the intial phase of
what is expected to grow into a larger order. A future phase is likely to
include the introduction of a Racal-designed automatic, remote dial-up
telemetry acquisition capability, enabling the pipeline control station in
N'dola to monitor the inlet and outlet pressures at each of six pumping
stations. In the current contract the monitoring requirement is met by voice
reporting or by manual data messaging. Delivery is due to be complete by the
second half of the year.

The two largest contracts are very different. One is for the joinery work
required in the restoration of the 17th century Uppark House, a National
Trust property near Petersfield, West Sussex.
The other major contract, a little more unusual, although not unique for
this P&amp;O company, is the fitting out of the 1929 luxury motor yacht Jezebel:
Work on the 248 ft yacht is being carried out for DML(Devonport Management
Ltd) to the designs of yacht designer Jon Bannenberg.
All the main items will be made at Ashby &amp; Horner Joinery's works at
Thurrock and then installed in the yacht at the Devonport Royal Dockyard in
Plymouth over the next 18 months.
The work includes all the interiors to the owner's and guests' main
accommodation. This includes the saloon, dining room, library and staterooms
with bathrooms.
The lift interiors and the common areas in the owner and guest accommodation
are also part of the contract.
Ceilings will have veneered perimeters and lacquereed cof fered centres.
Covered fabric panels with special features will adorn the walls.
High quality carpets, timber parquet and marble will be used for the
flooring, either separately or in a combination of all three.
Jezabel is currently in dry dock and has been stripped down to the bare hull
for survey and any repairs needed before the reconstruction starts. Although
she will be fully equipped with modern systems, the vessel's original style
and character will be carefully recreated.

FT  27 MAY 92 / People: Worldwide liaison from St Helens
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Pilkington's new group legal adviser, from the beginning of June, is a
keep-fit fanatic - who once ran hilly marathons in under three hours and
took part in an Everest expedition. He has now turned his energies to
windsurfing - and to managing the legal resources of Pilkington worldwide.
David Bricknell, 43, joined the UK glassmaker in 1974 from Slaughter &amp; May.
He was company secretary from 1981 to 1989; and is currently manager of the
group legal department and number two to Tony Hartley, 62, who retires at
the end of the month after a 33-year stint at Pilkington.
Bricknell explains that while he only wished to alter 'one paragraph of the
job description', the emphasis of his task has changed - away from
licensing, which once consumed a lot of time but is now under a separate
team within technology management. He will hence be freer to concentrate on
'worldwide liaison'.
'With only 20-25 per cent of our business based in the UK, we have to rely
on local (legal) advisers a lot,' says Bricknell who was closely involved in
the 1980 purchase of Flachglass in Germany. 'And the scale of both costs and
damages these days means this dimension of the business has to be managed in
as tight and disciplined a way as any other expenditure.'
While the headquarters for much of the European operation has moved to
Brussels - causing a furore in St Helens - Bricknell is part of the small
corporate headquarters concerned with global strategy that remains in
Lancashire.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Bill Hooley, who, in January last year signed a three-year, Pounds
71,500-a-year contract as managing director of Butte Mining, a London-listed
company, has resigned.
The announcement about his departure follows news last week that Butte,
which has not made a profit since it was floated five years ago and has a
present market value of about Pounds 5m, had started a legal action in the
US claiming Dollars 325m damages.
Butte has been advised to conserve its resources to ensure it has the cash
to fight the legal battle and has therefore decided to halt temporarily its
exploration and mine development operations. 'Bill is a mining engineer and
he prefers digging holes in the ground. He feels he is an overhead we don't
need,' says a spokesman. No replacement managing director will be recruited.
The cash conservation effort has also seen David Lloyd-
Jacob, the executive chairman, agree to take only half the Pounds 100,000 a
year guaranteed by his three-year contract.
Hooley will work for Butte four days a week as a consultant in Australia
where he went after it took over two small companies there. Previously he
had worked with Dallhold Resources.

MIKE OTTY was taking something of a leap into the unknown when he decided to
move from trying to set up an electronic rival to Glass's Guide, the UK
motor trade's used car price 'Bible', to taking a job with Al Habtoor, a
Dubai-headquartered conglomerate active throughout the Gulf.
That was nine years ago, and not long after he had parted company with car
maker Peugeot Talbot as its sales operations director in the UK.
Dubai had seemed a sunnier prospect in more ways than one, as the UK motor
trade and industry continued a long struggle to emerge from its early 1980s
recession.
Initially, Otty signed up to help Al Habtoor increase its network of motor
distribution businesses in the Emirates, and which now include such
illustrious names as Rolls-Royce.  But although making the leap, Otty was
destined to land firmly on his feet: this month he was appointed a group
managing director under chairman Khalaf Al Habtoor.
From now on, vehicles will form only a part of his remit.
The others include construction, hotels, trading - and even marble and
perfume.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Management: A coalition versus a dictator / Learning from
experience that shareholders have a hard fight ahead if they want to fire
the management
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISTAIR BLAIR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Bad managers have been eyeing their shareholders with anxiety recently. Over
the last 18 months the big institutional investors have shown themselves
willing to remove managements which are not performing well.
The trend has been greeted with general applause: onlookers argue that the
institutions have found a new spirit at last. However, this view is
mistaken. There is no new spirit. The apparent revolt by the institutions is
just another aspect of the recession.
The weak economy has exposed bad management and has also made it difficult
for institutions to sell shareholdings. The decline in takeover activity has
also put the spotlight on management, as companies which might otherwise
have been predators have been forced to turn their resources inwards.
Most cases of bad management unfold slowly. For instance, at Brown &amp;
Jackson, the discount retailer, and at Great Western Resources, the oil and
gas group, institutional pressure has led to a change of chairman. But the
circumstances leading up to the changes took a year or more to unfold,
during which time the share prices declined steadily.
Many people have argued that institutions should act more quickly. However,
the balance of power between managements and their shareholders is heavily
skewed in the former's favour, making quick action in most cases difficult,
if not impossible.
The typical fund manager runs a portfolio of between 50 and 150 stocks, and
looks at up to 100 new stocks a year for possible investment. Other calls on
his time include reports to investors, marketing presentations and internal
management meetings. He will not be able to spend more than a few days a
year on any one stock.
Suppose you are a fund manager who feels the management in one of your
stocks has taken the wrong track. You have a choice: change the management
or sell the stock. If you wanted to adopt the first route, what would be
involved?
Your first port of call would be the management itself to unearth
information and air your concerns. But the managers are unlikely to accept
your criticisms. They will plead deeper understanding of their business, a
plea that you cannot refute.
You are not convinced, so you contact fellow institutions. Many will not
share your concerns; after all, this is not a headline case. Some
shareholders are bound to agree with you, although most of them will be
intent on selling the stock, not on causing a revolution in the boardroom.
To go on, you need to speak for 10-15 per cent of the company (assuming
there are no big blocks supportive of management). If you get to this level,
you have done well: you have got the support of say three of the top five
institutional shareholders in the company.
Now the real task begins. You need time because there is now going to be a
serious fight. You are not just challenging management decisions, but the
very livelihoods of the managers. The stakes for them are much higher than
for you, and they will fight hard.
They also have money on their side: the board will activate the whole
corporate finance panoply - auditors, lawyers, merchant bankers,
stockbrokers, public relations consultants. Each will depict a good
management doing its best. Their presentations will be authoritative because
they are based on hard information from inside the company.
Some changes in policy may be announced, together perhaps with the sale of a
subsidiary. Are these sufficient for you? If not, check how the rest of your
ginger group views them. It is important to maintain cohesion.
The management's presentation is now being wheeled around the uncommitted
institutional shareholders. Meanwhile, you are having to make your case
without a battery of advisers. The company may be able to spend hundreds of
thousands of pounds on professional fees, but your budget is likely to be
close to zero.
It will be hard to convince the trustee of your fund to allocate fund money
for professional fees. Nor will your own company be an easy touch. Even if
you do raise some money for professional fees, the other fund managers you
have enlisted may be unable to do so. Your cohesiveness becomes more
fragile.
You lack experience of this type of exercise. Fund managers are listeners,
not persuaders. Even if you have a flair for presentation, it will be
difficult to match the management's arguments because you are working only
on the basis of the information they have given you.
Most debilitating of all, you are a coalition facing a dictator. The
management will react quickly and decisively to each turn of events, whereas
the fund managers, who work for different firms, may find decisions
difficult to arrive at, especially when the writs start flying.
Even if you have found the time, and can manage without the money, how about
the visibility? How does your marketing director feel about your efforts?
Corporate governance may be a good thing, but it tends to draw clients'
attention to your bad investments.
The next problem is the likely reaction from your other investments. In
future, their managements may prove less willing to be open with you.
Beware your own chief executive. Does it look wise, from where he sits, to
put your firm in the spotlight?
In reality, this sort of battle rarely happens, and for good reasons. At
every stage there is only one rational course of action for the fund
manager: sell the stock. If you cannot, you will have to wait for a takeover
bid. Failing that, wait for the bad management to become so acute that the
board itself sorts the problem out. Only if none of these solutions is
possible will the odds be sufficiently in the fund manager's favour to make
it worth exercising shareholder power.
The author was corporate finance director of Fidelity Investments until
earlier this year.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Management: Discretion is the better part of valeur / A look
into the mystery of French bosses' pay, and finds they are doing nicely
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Ask a senior French executive how much he or she is paid and you are likely
to be shown the door.
The French have a catholic distaste for talking about private money,
reflected in company disclosure laws which oblige employers to tell no one
but the taxman how much their top people are paid.
So some guesswork is needed to work out who gets what. Recent estimates by
Towers Perrin, the pay and personnel consultancy, suggest that directors of
companies with over FFr1bn (Pounds 100m) turnover pull in the second highest
gross salaries in the world - between FFr2m and FFr2.5m. This is well behind
their criticised US counterparts.
Yet in net terms, France's top people get a less impressive pay packet -
around FFr764,000 annually - behind the Germans, British and Japanese, after
the high tax and social security charges for which France is renowned.
Quoted companies are not, as in Anglo Saxon countries, obliged to publish
the boss's salary, though they do have to declare in the annual report the
sum of the top directors' pay.
So it is that the Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the water distribution to
construction giant, rumoured to be a generous rewarder of top people,
reveals in its 1990 annual report that it paid FFr28.8m to its top 20
directors, an average of FFr1.44m each. The average is misleading, since the
chairman, Guy Dejouany, is rumoured to earn above the odds.
However, the chairman's salary is unlikely to be the whole story. He will
typically receive top-ups from a number of foreign subsidiaries, usually
small amounts set just under the income tax-paying threshold in each of
those countries. This is an entirely legal tax avoidance technique, explain
consultants.
On top of this, French directors tend to hold more non-executive board seats
on other companies than their Anglo-Saxon counterparts, believes Heidrich
and Struggles, the leading headhunter. They pick up a fee every time,
sometimes amounting to an impressive total.
Some senior corporate figures sit on more than half a dozen company boards,
an essential part of the networks of influence and patronage that bind
together the higher echelons of French finance and industry.
Not surprisingly, the biggest groups are reputed to pay the best directors'
fees, or jetons de presence. Compagnie Generale des Eaux paid FFr1.45m to 12
non-executive directors, in 1990, an average of FFr120,000 each.
Then come benefits in kind. Here French companies use share options much
less than their British counterparts, and are less generous with company
cars, but tend to be more willing when it comes to other perks. These
include chauffeurs (pure status symbols, given that being driven to work in
traffic-jammed Paris usually takes much longer than going by metro).
Another popular perk is a company-owned flat rented out to the senior
executive at a cheap rate. This is a valuable perk in France because rental
allowances are taxed like normal income.
However, the tax authorities are prepared to countenance a reasonably cheap
rent on a company owned property, so allowing the executive to pocket the
difference between the subsidised and commercially realistic rent free of
tax.
Anecdotes abound on French companies' generosity in expenses for receptions,
seminars in the Bahamas and management meetings in Tuscan villas - although
it is hard to get companies to admit to such open-handedness.
In keeping with directors' coyness over the size of their salaries, secrecy
also surrounds the way in which pay is set. In the private sector, a small
committee of two or three of the most influential administrators decide the
chairman's salary in private. The figure is communicated to the boss alone,
and remains a mystery to other board members, including - crucially - the
staff representatives which every French company above a certain size must
include on its board.
In state-owned industry, which includes seven of France's 10 top companies,
the system is different. Here it will be up to the government minister
responsible - usually industry or finance - to settle the chairman's salary.
On the whole, public sector company chairmen are paid less than their
opposite numbers in the private sector because the benchmark ministers use
is the pay of civil servants. This tradition is coming under strain,
however, as state owned companies increasingly employ executives from the
private sector or acquire privately owned companies. Francis Lorentz,
chairman of the state-owned computer group Bull, is said to earn rather less
than some of his ex-private sector staff.
Consultants believe the French top salary system is under pressure to become
more open, as French industry becomes more international. Companies with
share quotations on Anglo-Saxon markets, for instance, may have to give as
much information as their overseas counterparts. Examples include Elf
Aquitaine, the oil and gas group, its rival, Total, and Pechiney, the
aluminium and packaging group, which have New York quotations.
However, all three say their chairmen's salaries are still confidential. Old
traditions take a while to die.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Jobs: Swiss slide below the Brits - How executive pay varies
across Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL DIXON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IT cannot be denied any longer
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the ski-lift has definitely gone into reverse. Over nigh on a decade of
comparing the buying-power enjoyed by European executives, I became so used
to seeing the Swiss soaring high above everybody as to doubt they would ever
be knocked off the peak.
Indeed, such was their supremacy that even when the Spanish and the
Luxembourgeois edged above them 12 months ago, I felt sure they would be
back at the top this year. How wrong I was may be seen from the table over
to the right: they have been overtaken by their counterparts in yet another
four nations, including the United Kingdom. But before commenting further,
I'll explain how the table works.
As in previous years, it is drawn from the annual survey made by the Wyatt
consultancy group's arm in Brussels. The latest version covers 1,470
companies of assorted sizes and activities in 17 European countries, and
gives supplementary data on the United States and Turkey. Of the 17
countries, Belgium supplies the biggest sample of companies with 230, the
smallest sample being Luxembourg's 36. The study also gives information on
pay and perks for nine kinds of specialist directors as well as chief
executives, divided into company-turnover bands.
All of which is of course far more than I have room for. Anyone wanting the
full report can obtain it, at a price, from either Jean-Pierre Becquet at
273 Avenue de Tervuren (Box 4), 1150 Brussels, Belgium; tel (02) 771 99 10,
fax (02) 762 37 43: or Don McClune at 21 Tothill St, London SW1H 9LL; tel
071-222-8033, fax 071-222 9182.
My extracts are confined to chief executives and just two sorts of other
directors, of finance and of personnel, across companies of all sizes in
each land. And I have included only the dozen best-paying countries,
converting the currencies into sterling at the London closing rates on May
20.
In each case, the table gives basic salaries, total money pay including
bonuses, and a rough measure of buying power. The three 'lower quartile'
columns refer to the executive who'd be a quarter of the way up from the
foot of a ranking of all in the same job and land, the 'median' trio to the
one mid-way, and the 'upper quartile' trio to the one a quarter way down
from the top. Then come the standard averages.
The buying-power is calculated by taking the total cash pay, deducting the
particular country's normal tax and social security charges for a person
with the specified income who is married with two dependent children, then
adjusting the resulting net pay in line with Wyatt's index of international
variances in executives' living costs.
Alas, it is a loosely approximate measure at best. The reason is that, since
survey companies evidently find it impossible to devise a gauge of housing
costs that is consistent across different countries, that central item of
spending is left out of account. Nevertheless the index is the best measure
available of what pay is worth, and the countries are ranked by the average
buying power of the three executives listed.
On that criterion, the Spanish hold the top place they gained last year,
with the Italians leapfrogging into second place over the Luxembourgeois who
rank above the French by dint of paying the two specialist directors better.
That is also why the Swiss are higher than the Austrians, although both are
now below the UK and in the lower half of the ranking. Among the rest, the
Belgians have regained the slight lead over the Dutch which they lost 12
months ago.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Hopes rise amid trade gloom
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE is a small crumb of comfort in yesterday's worse-than-expected UK
visible and current-account trade figures for April.
The respective Pounds 470m increases between March and April in the
seasonally adjusted visible trade deficit to Pounds 1.36bn and in the
provisionally estimated current-account deficit to Pounds 1.06bn suggest
that UK domestic demand is reviving at last. The first-quarter decline in
gross domestic product, disclosed last week, may mark the end of the
recession.
The bad news in yesterday's figures from the Central Statistical Office is
that the UK's trade figures have taken a sudden turn for the worse long
before recovery has become firmly established.
There were no such deficits at this stage of the business cycle after the
recessions of 1973-75 or 1979-81.
Nor could the CSO's statisticians find any extraordinary factors in
yesterday's figures to explain the worsening trend. On what is often
considered the most reliable indicator of underlying trends - trade volumes
minus oil and so-called erratic items such as aircraft, ships, oil rigs and
precious stones - UK exports continued to grow in the three months to April.
They were 2.3 per cent higher than in the three months from November to
January and 4.2 per cent higher than between February and April last year.
However, import volumes less oil and erratics were 4.3 per cent higher in
February to April than in the previous three months, and 7.4 per cent higher
than in the February to April period last year.
Import volumes in the latest three-month period have been growing at roughly
twice the rate of export volumes. Trade between Britain and its European
Community partners has been especially disappointing in recent months.
Exports were only 0.8 per cent higher in value terms in the three months to
April than in the November to January period. At the same time, imports from
other EC countries grew by 4.4 per cent.
Britain's exports to Germany, the UK's biggest trading partner, were
virtually unchanged in the latest three months, while imports from Germany
rose by 5 per cent compared with the preceding three months. Between March
and April, UK imports from Germany rose by 4.5 per cent while exports to
Germany fell by 9.5 per cent.
Another concern was the way the increase in imports last month was fairly
evenly spread across all product categories. According to Mr Kevin Gardiner,
UK economist at Warburg Securities in London, the import figures were
'pretty punchy and flagging a widening deficit to come'.
One month's figures can - as the Treasury always points out - be deceptive.
It may be that last month's 3.5 per cent jump in imports into the UK
reflected wholesalers' and retailers' expectations of an increase in UK
demand rather than an actual rise in demand. In that case, the April trade
figures may be a reflection of increased stocks.
If, on the other hand, the figures reflect genuine strong demand for
imported goods, they pose serious questions about how far the UK's recovery
from recession can be sustained before it runs into a balance-of-payments
constraint.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Five regional radio permits to be offered
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RADIO Authority announced yesterday that it is planning to advertise
five regional commercial radio licences covering up to 4.5m adults in the
autumn. They will be advertised in areas where FM frequencies are available.
The regional stations, in addition to Radio Authority plans for three
national commercial stations, will cover central Scotland, north-east
England, the west Midlands, north-west England - the largest - and the
Severn estuary, covering south Wales and Avon.
The Radio Authority said applicants would have to offer something different
from existing radio stations in the area. The way is clear for those wanting
to offer thematic stations offering a particular music format. Mr Peter
Baldwin, director of the Radio Authority, sees the new regional stations as
a way of offering other parts of the UK some of the commercial radio choice
available in London.
The formal announcement about the stations came as the Radio Authority
yesterday published a consultative document on the re-advertisement of 55
independent local radio licences that expire by February 1995. The authority
plans to begin the re-advertising process and complete it by the end of
1993.
The controversial element of the plan is to advertise AM and FM frequencies
separately. Many local stations have been running dual-frequency
transmissions served by a single news operation.
The Radio Authority may decide that an existing local station should keep
only one of its frequencies.
Mr Baldwin believes that there is likely to be a reasonable degree of
stability but that each case will be judged on its merits. If two
frequencies are awarded in a particular area to two different companies then
it will be up to them to decide what economies of scale are possible through
co-operation.
Senior executives of the Radio Authority are also due to meet Mr David
Mellor, National Heritage secretary, next month to discuss the future of
radio in the UK.
The Radio Authority would be horrified if, as some are suggesting, BBC Radio
1 and Radio 2 should take advertising at a time when national commercial
stations offering classical music, pop and speech are trying to establish
themselves.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Call to strengthen Commons groups
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE cross-party Commons committees that shadow government departments should
be given greater powers to call the prime minister to account, Mr Michael
Meacher, a member of Labour's shadow cabinet, said yesterday.
In a speech at a Labour rally as part of the party's leadership contest, Mr
Meacher said that the committees should have a new role in relation to the
prime minister.
The prime minister should be answerable to the relevant committee if he
intervened on a departmental matter, and the committees should be able to
ratify or stop important public appointments in their areas, he said.
Mr Meacher also called for the committees to be given stonger powers to
summon ministers to give evidence.
The departmental committees themselves have not yet been appointed since the
election. Although the government's business managers are trying to get them
established, there are some fears at Westminster that they might not be able
to start work until the autumn.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Trafford Park in line for Pounds 45m investment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of related agreements between Asda, Varity Holdings, Amec and
Trafford Park Development Corporation is expected to lead to Pounds 45m of
investment during the next five years, with up to 1,550 new jobs and more
than 1m sq ft of new factory space.
The developments will lead to Varity, the troubled international farm and
industrial machinery group, which owns Massey-Ferguson and Perkins, leaving
the Trafford Park industrial estate in Greater Manchester.
Worldwide distribution of Perkins replacement parts will be relocated to the
former steelworks town of Irlam, still within the corporation's area.
A new 17-acre warehouse and office complex in Irlam will be run by
Caterpillar Logistics Services, which will handle Massey-Ferguson and
Perkins warehousing.
The principal part of the agreement involves the redevelopment of 70 acres
of former Massey-Ferguson land in the main Trafford Park area.
Varity is selling 30 acres to Asda for a shopping development, with the
development corporation acquiring the rest. Varity and the corporation have
negotiated an agreement with Amec Properties for phased redevelopment of the
site, starting next year.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Security-aware design urged for buildings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POLICE yesterday launched a campaign to incorporate crime prevention into
the design of commercial buildings.
Secured by Design, an initiative that orginally applied only to new
residential properties, has been extended to new and renovated commercial
properties.
Last year there were 550,000 commercial and 600,000 domestic burglaries, but
police say that simple measures, such as good lighting for footpaths and car
parks, can deter burglars.
Developers are to be encouraged to consult police crime prevention experts
at an early stage and to incorporate security features in building
specifications. Properties that meet police guidelines can then be marketed
using the Secured by Design logo as a selling point.
Advice from police architectural liaison officers will be free, and the
publicity campaign is being sponsored by lock-makers and other providers of
security equipment.
Crime-prevention officers recommended that even the layout of an estate,
whether commercial or residential, should be planned with security in mind.
Barriers should create well defined 'defensible space' around estates and
individual properties.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Exchange grows heated over computers / A look at why market
makers are again becoming angry over plans for new technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN CANE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NOT since the Seaq quote-distribution system expired with a whimper during
Big Bang in 1986 has there been such a fuss over Stock Exchange technology.
The immediate cause is the exchange's decision, announced last month, to
pass responsibility for running its computer operations to Andersen
Consulting, one of the world's largest business consultancies.
The contract, worth between Pounds 10m and Pounds 15m a year to Andersen
over the next five years, is of a kind known in the computer business as
'outsourcing'. The exchange's 305-strong data-processing staff were
transferred overnight on to Andersen's payroll and the consultancy has
agreed to meet stiff terms on service delivery and performance.
It has also agreed to work in partnership with the exchange to 're-engineer'
the market support systems, implementing modernisation plans which the
exchange's top management has had in place for some time.
Outsourcing is increasingly popular with large companies anxious to
concentrate on their core businesses rather than run large and expensive
data-processing operations. Since the announcement, however, Mr Peter
Rawlins, the Stock Exchange's chief executive, has found himself under fire.
Some critics say he has given away the heart of the exchange's operation
with its technological capability.
Others say that Andersen was unfairly favoured when the contract was awarded
without competitive tendering. The latter point to the fact that until 1983
Mr Rawlins was an Andersen partner, admittedly on the accounting rather than
consultancy side.
Mr Rawlins gives such insinuations short shrift, arguing that Andersen was
selected on merit after four months of intense evaluation and that the
decision was taken by the full board of the Stock Exchange.
The conflict has tended to obscure the real issue. The exchange's sprawling
systems undoubtedly should be replaced urgently, but is what Mr Rawlins has
in mind the best way forward and has his vision of the future the support of
the members?
The exchange's computer systems for collecting and distributing price
information and settling bargains have grown piecemeal over the years. They
have been a victim of a continuing uncertainty within the membership over
the exchange designing and building its own technology.
Aconsequence has been erratic funding and a lack of management vision. Seaq,
for example, the centrepiece of the 1986 move to electronic marketmaking,
was a string-and-sealing-wax solution put together in too much of a hurry.
The central database, Epic, on which the rest of the operation depends, is
16 years old. There are eight different and incompatible kinds of hardware
in use: IBM, DEC, Tandem - even some old Modcomp machines kept going only by
cannibalising others for spare parts.
The exchange uses eight different programming languages with an emphasis on
Pascal - which is used elsewhere mostly for scientific and technical
computing. A simple business change such as earlier opening can take nine
months to implement.
There are nine different networks. Mr Rawlins complains: 'We are drowning in
wires; the people we are really enriching is BT.'
Maintaining and running the systems costs Pounds 52m a year exclusive of
property costs - more than a quarter of the entire exchange's operational
costs. In short, the present systems are too costly and inflexible to allow
the exchange to provide an economic service or remain competitive in global
terms.
Mr Rawlins' plan envisages an 'open systems' solution: standard hardware,
standard software and a single, common network. He estimates that such a
solution could cut costs by up to 40 per cent.
One drawback is that the existing system cannot simply be thrown away - it
is supporting the markets reliably, if inefficiently, and nothing can be
allowed to interfere with day-to-day trading.
Mr Rawlins says that all possible ways of re-engineering the critical
systems were investigated before Andersen was selected. An internal solution
was rejected because of a lack of resources.
Facilities management - using an outside firm to manage the existing systems
 -did not seem to offer cost savings. The exchange was determined to keep
control of the systems. Mr Rawlins says: 'These systems are the market. We
have to keep control.'
He does not, however, enjoy the total confidence of his membership. Many
suspect that the real thrust behind his plan is the development of an
order-driven electronic exchange - perhaps along the lines of the system
Andersen built for the Swiss Options and Futures Exchange.
Some critics fear that that would effectively spell the end of the existing
market-making system in London. Indeed, the exchange has just launched a
wide-ranging review of the marketmaking system which it introduced at the
time of Big Bang.
The abrupt way in which the Andersen contract was awarded has done nothing
to allay such fears.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Greenpeace criticises Earth Summit agenda
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
GREENPEACE, the environ-mental activist organisation, has accused organisers
of next week's Earth Summit of allowing it to be 'hijacked by industry' and
failing to include in the conference agenda any controls on industrial
activities.
At a press conference in Rio de Janeiro, Mr Kenny Bruno, co-ordinator of the
Greenpeace Hazardous Export/Import Project, said the Summit had 'adopted
industry's line that first world corporations have the capacity to spread
environmentally sound, sustainable technologies thoughout the world'. The
truth was that they remained 'the primary creators of dirty, dangerous and
unsustainable technologies and are at the root of all the world's main
environmental problems.'
Mr Bruno accused companies of 'greenwash', which he said meant 'hiding
environmentally destructive practices behind environmental images and
language stolen from the ecological movement'.
In a report Greenpeace examines the records of big companies which Mr Bruno
claims 'are proclaiming environmentalism' while continuing to cause damage.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US CONSUMER confidence registered its third consecutive monthly increase in
May, reinforcing other signs of a gradual economic recovery, Michael Prowse
writes from Washington.
The Conference Board, a New York business analysis group, said its index of
confidence rose to 71.6 this month, against 65.1 in April and a low of 47.3
in February. The increase was larger than expected, but left the index short
of the 100-plus level normal in a healthy recovery.
Mr Fabian Linden, for the Board, said the steady rise in confidence left
'little doubt that the economy is at long last recovering'.
The stronger figures follow the Federal Reserve's decision last week that
lower interest rates were not needed to sustain the recovery. For the first
time since August the Fed reportedly shifted to a neutral monetary stance,
abandoning its previous bias towards lower short-term rates.
More than a quarter of respondents to the Board's survey said they expected
the business outlook to improve over the next six month.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US biotechnology companies will not need special approval to market food
products they develop, as long as they do not drastically alter the genetic
make-up of the food, the White House said yesterday, Reuter reports from
Washington.
The policy proclamation decrees that genetically engineered foods - emerging
strains ranging from tomatoes to cucumbers and melons - are not inherently
more dangerous than other products and do not need extensive pre-marketing
tests. The Food and Drug Administration, which regulates most US foods, will
not require identifying labels on genetically altered products under the new
policy.
The policy decision was expected and fiercely opposed by some consumer
watchdogs, on health and safety grounds. But the White House rejected their
fears that fruits and vegetables genetically altered to produce tastier,
more nutritious or longer-lived produce might be dangerous.
'The US is already the world leader in biotechnology and we want to keep it
that way,' Mr Dan Quayle, vice-president, said when announcing the policy.
Under the policy the FDA will require pre-market testing only if products
are altered in such a way that safety issues are raised. One example might
be if a new product was unlike anything that had been safety-tested before.
The guidelines should be a boon for agricultural biotechnology companies,
which have fretted for years that pre-market approval of genetic goods might
be required.
There are about 2,000 biotechnology companies in the US, but only about 10
per cent are involved in the food sector.
New techniques like cell-cloning or gene-transfer have raised hopes of
hardier breeds, but also some fears.
The Foundation for Economic Trends, run by Mr Jeremy Rifkin, a consumer
activist, filed a petition with the FDA on May 18 asking for tight rules on
biotechnology.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Dual approach to electricity sell-offs
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   SINGAPORE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH-EAST Asian nations are moving towards a dual approach to privatisation
and restructuring of their electricity supply industries, the Financial
Times Asian Electricity Conference was told yesterday.
The pattern evolving among key members of the Association of South-east
Asian Nations (Asean) - Malaysia, Indonesia, Thailand and the Philippines -
was for independent, private power generators in competition for electricity
sales with the state utilities, and for the longer-term restructuring of the
state companies aimed at selling their shares on the region's stock
exchanges.
The pace is being set by Malaysia's state utility Tenaga Nasional Berhad, 23
per cent of whose shares were recently sold by subscription to institutions
and individual investors in the country's biggest state-sector share
flotation. Trading in the shares on the Kuala Lumpur stock exchange is
imminent.
Mr S. Samy Vellu, the Malaysian energy minister, said the flotation had been
substantially oversubscribed and more shares could go on the market soon if
a strong price was established.
Other Asean nations have their own privatisation programmes, but their
approach tends to be to invite independent power generators to set up
alongside national utilities. Restructuring of the state companies would
come later, and a cautious approach would be taken to any sell-off of state
assets, the conference was told.
Mr Artono Arismunandar, Indonesia's director-general of electricity, said
his country already had a lot of private-sector power operating alongside
the PLN, the state utility, but most was for own-use in industrial estates
and company towns. The country aimed to boost sale of surplus private power
to the national grid and to invite new private power generators to share in
new projects.
Mr Danilo Cantiller, economics department manager for the National Power
Corporation of the Philippines (NPC), said his country had an open-door
policy to private-sector power generating companies to supplement the output
of the NPC. Enabling legislation declaring that the PLN was no longer a
natural monopoly was passed in 1987.
A study of the possible break-up and privatisation of the NPC was being
undertaken.
Mr Piyasvasti Amranand of Thailand's National Energy Policy Office said the
abolition of trade unions at the Electricity Generating Authority of
Thailand several years ago had made it possible for the authority to
consider some form of privatisation.

AUSTRALIAN Prime Minister Paul Keating yesterday announced a cabinet
reshuffle forced on his government by the resignation last week of his most
powerful and influential strategist, Senator Graham Richardson, reports
Emilia Tagaza in Canberra.
The reshuffle, though minor, is another setback for Mr Keating. One of the
ministerial posts was filled by someone who is likely to unseat another of
his staunchest supporters in parliament, the Speaker of the House of
Representatives, Mr Leo McLeay.
The new minister for consumer affairs, Miss Jeanette McHugh, has represented
a seat which was recently abolished in a redistribution ahead of the next
election. Most voters in her constituency were moved to Mr McLeay's
electorate. It is understood Miss McHugh is determined to get the seat back
from Mr McLeay.
Senator Richardson resigned last week after reports that he might have
supported a relative's shady activity in the Marshall Islands.
He was instrumental in delivering votes to Mr Keating in his leadership
challenge to former Prime Minister Mr Bob Hawke last year. His resignation,
together with an increased budget deficit, threaten whatever political gains
Mr Keating made in the last four months.
Senator Richardson's former position as minister for transport and
communication has been filled by Mr Bob Collins.

THAILAND'S acting government yesterday lifted a state of emergency imposed
on Bangkok and four surrounding provinces during violent confrontations
between pro-democracy demonstrators and troops last week.
The authorities banned public gatherings under the state of emergency, but
protesters ignored the order. At least 48 people were killed by the armed
forces before the king of Thailand brokered a compromise and Gen Suchinda
Kraprayoon, the prime minister, was forced to resign.
The five-party coalition government which appointed Gen Suchinda bowed to
popular pressure on Monday and approved constitutional amendments demanded
by the opposition to reduce the power of the military.
Yesterday the pro-military coalition appeared to be on the brink of falling
apart as its members attempted to choose a new prime minister and faced
demands for the punishment of the senior military officers responsible for
the shootings.
Various solutions are being aired, including a new coalition which would
bring in some of the opposition parties, and the possibility of new
elections.
There is widespread concern the military will feel cornered by demands for
retribution and stage a coup d'etat. Opposition parties have asked the
constitutional tribunal to rescind an amnesty decree signed by Gen Suchinda
which pardons demonstrators and those who gave the troops the order to
shoot.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Fall of the tireless salaryman: Signs of a decline in
Japan's famed work ethic
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVING bickered with his daughter over the choice of daytime television
dramas, the holiday-stricken salaryman grabs his golf clubs and heads for
the driving range. In the cartoon's next frame, he slices the ball, smashing
a window in an adjacent house. In the end, not knowing where to turn, he
seeks refuge back at the office, behind his faithful desk.
Once the hero, portrayed in the glorious style of socialist realism, the
factory and office 'warrior' dedicated to building a strong Japan has become
a media-mocked buffoon, lacking in social skills, alienated from his family,
and comfortable only in the company of his desk. Young Japanese laugh at the
thought of emulating him, and company managers are aghast at the pointed
criticism that has skewered the salaryman.
The salaryman's fall from grace is part of a larger debate over the fate of
the country's famed work ethic, said to be under siege by modern comforts
and a creeping, corrupting individualism. This theory is partly inspired by
the recurring nightmare that Japan has 'peaked', that the economy is in
quickening decline and that directionless Japanese youth will lead the
country into mediocrity.
Mr Akio Morita, Sony chairman, regarded as Japan's Prince Charles for his
sometimes lofty though not irrelevant observations, relaunched the debate a
few weeks ago with an unexpected confession that employees are underpaid and
overworked. He said companies have failed to recognise that the era of
aggressive growth has passed and, essentially, should be more caring and
sharing.
The timing of Mr Morita's comments, just before the annual wage bargaining
season, drew gasps of disbelief from other executives who saw the Sony boss
as loading the heavy artillery for the unions. However, Japanese unions are
weaker than at any time in recent history and quickly agreed to small pay
rises after a half-day ceremonial strike by train drivers, who later offered
humble apologies for the inconvenience caused.
With wage negotiations out of the way, Japanese executives have felt free to
express their opinions on the work ethic, and not all disagree with Mr
Morita. Meanwhile, Mr Kiichi Miyazawa, the prime minister, has just received
two reports from special committees drafting a New Economic Plan to better
balance the priorities of GNP growth and lifestyle.
One report urged that Japan become a 'lifestyle superpower', as opposed to a
military or economic superpower. And, as one way of attaining this distant
goal, recommended that the country's commuter trains, famed for those
white-gloved guards who shove excess passengers into already crammed
carriages, be 10 per cent less crowded.
Another committee found, as committees have in the past, that the present
economic structure focuses too much on the company and too little on the
consumer, and that while statistically wealthy, Japanese do not feel
affluent. But this government committee went further, encouraging the
individualism that is widely seen as a threat to 'groupism', company
loyalty, and the work ethic.
'We must make Japan a society in which people can attain a better quality of
life, an equitable society where every citizen can both appreciate a
comfortable and leisurely lifestyle, and have equal opportunities to develop
an individual sense of values,' the report recommended.
A survey of 2,125 corporate executives by the Keidanren, the employers
federation, showed support for shorter working hours and recognition that
the salaryman did not have a leisurely lifestyle. This executive support was
tempered by the beliefs that Japan 'cannot afford' to reduce the working
week and that Japanese had an innate love of work.
But a majority of executives also said this 'love' was fading among younger
workers, the shinjinrui or new breed, who see no role model in the
middle-aged, desk-bound salaryman. By repute, the ethic-less younger
generation will take holidays, swap jobs, and refuse to compromise personal
interests for the company good.
The changes are more in attitude than action. A separate survey of 10,000
residents by the prime minister's office found, across all age groups and
both sexes, that only 24 per cent thought personal fulfilment more important
than the national interest, though among males aged between 25 and 29, the
figure was 39 per cent.
Yet graduates' choice of companies this year showed a clear bias towards the
neatly drawn career path and lifetime employment offered by the typical
large company and the bureaucracy. Meanwhile, the onset of recession has
encouraged the electronics makers, which pioneered the unorthodox practice
of mid-career hiring, to reduce this intake to a few specialist staff.
'I thought about working in a small company or starting my own business, but
it was safer to work for a big financial company,' said a graduate who
joined Yamaichi Securities a year ago. He did not particularly like the work
or the weight of the hierarchy bearing down on him, but 'I don't really have
a choice'.
Rather than young Japanese breaking the social contract, some troubled
industries are now tempted to lay off staff. Securities companies increased
their employees by 41.6 per cent over the four years to 1990, and the
mid-sized brokers, most bruised by the stock market collapse, are trying to
find a way to close branches without making staff redundant.
The government, meanwhile, will soon have to reschedule the official
timetable for the reduction of working hours. The aim was to get the
official average working year down from 2,050 hours to 1,800 hours by next
year. Unpaid overtime pushes the total as high as 3,000 hours in industries
such as banking. But, in the Keidanren survey, 44 per cent of companies were
not sure that the 1,800 target could be reached by the end of the century.
'One's life is made up of time, and this should be better understood,'
explained a sympathetic executive at Coal Resources Development, a coal
importer. But the case of another resources company is more illuminating -
Mitsubishi Oil became suddenly famous two years ago when news surfaced of a
scheme to fine employees who did not take their full complement of holidays.
The truth is that the scheme involved only seven employees in one small
section of the crude oil import division. Last year, four of the seven
workers failed to take a total of 14 days' holiday and the Y14,000 in fines
went to buy beer and sake for their end-of-year party.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Chiefs, Indians and Rabuka go to polls in Fiji: Bullets or
ballots, this time Fiji's military ruler wants to take power in an election
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAJOR General Sitiveni Rabuka has taken power in Fiji twice since 1987, each
time at the point of a gun. This week, he hopes to take power again, through
the more unpredictable mechanism of the ballot box.
Almost exactly five years after Mr Rabuka's first armed intervention,
Fijians are voting in a general election organised by an interim civilian
government.
The election will almost certainly return the ethnic Fijian Soqosoqo ni
Vakavulewa ni Taukei (SVT) party, led by Mr Rabuka, as the largest
parliamentary group. But it seems unlikely to resolve the underlying
tensions among Fiji's 345,000 ethnic Fijians, 340,000 Indians and 35,000
Europeans, Chinese, Polynesians and other races.
The army took power in May 1987 in the name of ethnic Fijian nationalism,
claiming that a coalition government dominated by Indians was making Fijians
second-class citizens in their own country. It was a message which made Mr
Rabuka a hero to many ethnic Fijians, especially when the army intervened a
second time to torpedo a compromise agreement which would have given the
coalition a continued role in government.
But by focusing on a single cause of tension, the nationalist rhetoric
obscured the underlying reasons for the coup, which had at least as much to
do with regional and class conflicts as with race.
The election of the coalition gave Indians a leading role in Fijian
government for the first time since their forebears arrived to work on sugar
plantations during British colonial rule. But the coalition also contained a
number of ethnic Fijians representing the trade-union based Fiji Labour
party, which wanted to reduce the influence of the chiefs, the traditional
leaders of ethnic Fijian society.
Furthermore, many of the Labour MPs came from the west of Viti Levu, Fiji's
main island, which has long resented the influence of the eastern-based
chiefly establishment. The constitution drawn up by the interim government
seeks to entrench ethnic Fijian political domination by reserving 37 of the
70 seats in the lower house of parliament. Indians have been allocated 27
seats, and other races five; one is reserved for the Polynesian island of
Rotuma.
In addition, the prime minister must be an ethnic Fijian, and veto power on
many issues has been given to a senate composed entirely of ethnic Fijians
selected by the Great Council of Chiefs, a traditional advisory body. The
constitution also seeks to entrench village values by over-representing
rural ethnic Fijians at the expense of urban voters who are more likely to
oppose chiefly influence.
In effect, the system is a compromise between Mr Rabuka and Fiji's elder
statesmen, Ratu Sir Penaia Ganilau, the former governor-general who is now
president, and Ratu Sir Kamisese Mara, the interim prime minister. Both
chiefs are believed to have argued for a less confrontational approach to
the Indian community, while supporting the objective of buttressing chiefly
influence.
However, the voting system means the SVT can only govern alone if it wins
almost all the ethnic Fijian seats. That is unlikely to happen, mainly
because of growing support for the more extreme Fijian Nationalist United
Front (FNUF), which has called for the expulsion of Indians. The SVT could
also lose some seats to the multiracial All National Congress, which would
probably line up with Indian opponents of the constitution.
The arithmetic is complicated by the Labour party's promise that its MPs
will boycott parliament, which would lower the threshold for a working
majority. But the most likely outcome is a hung parliament in which the FNUF
holds the balance of power.
If that happens, Ratu Sir Penaia will almost certainly have to appoint Mr
Rabuka head of an SVT/FNUF coalition government, which would be a
frightening prospect for many Indians. Indian business leaders say such an
outcome could lead to a further wave of emigration as better-off Indians
follow the example of the 23,000 largely professional workers who left after
the coups of 1987.
However, most Indians appear willing to stay provided there is no repetition
of the inter-racial violence which followed the first coup in 1987. Many
have extensive business interests which they would be reluctant to abandon.
In the longer term, both ethnic Fijians and Indians say the country has a
bright future if it can achieve stable government and maintain the strong
growth in tourism and manufacturing it has enjoyed under the interim
government.
On present trends, that is likely to happen in the early years of the next
century. Meanwhile, voters must wait until Sunday to learn the result of the
week-long election, which is taking place on more than 300 islands scattered
over more than 700,000 square kilometres of the South Pacific. This time, Mr
Rabuka must wait too.

Mr Stephanus Smith, head of ABSA's international banking services, said all
of the Bahrain-based banks he visited agreed to open foreign exchange lines
and most were also prepared to consider placing money market lines for
offshore finance at the South African bank's disposal.
He said this would bring the total of Middle East banks ready to do business

Gulf states have not formally lifted sanctions against South Africa but
deals which took place for years are gathering momentum as apartheid is

FT  27 MAY 92 / World Trade News: US set to spill beans on its EC oilseeds
'retaliation' - Dollars 1bn in sanctions being considered in Washington to
offset 'unfair' European subsidies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BUSH administration is debating a list of Dollars 1bn in sanctions it is
threatening to impose on European Community products in retaliation for the
EC's oilseeds regime which the US claims has cost it billions in soyabean
sales.
Foods, wines and beer are likely to head the list, but a number of US
officials believe it might provoke a greater outcry if industrial products
are included. The question has been forwarded to the Bush cabinet for
discussion, perhaps as early as this week, after an interagency group
committee was unable to agree.
For its part, the EC has yet to decide how to respond to the US threats. It
is said to be considering a compensation proposal. Complicating the issue is
the agreement reached last week by the EC farm ministers to reform the
Common Agricultural Policy, and the possibility that the changes ultimately
will at least partly address US complaints by reducing EC oilseeds
production.
The US made public its intention on April 30 to impose sanctions after the
EC blocked a report finding that EC oilseeds subsidies were illegal under
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. The EC indicated that it would
accept the report at a Gatt Council meeting in June and at the same time
propose a remedy.
Meanwhile, the Bush Administration, unasked, is getting industry's ideas.
The National Association of Wheat Growers, for example, has recommended new
tariffs on pasta and wheat gluten to level the 'uneven playing field'. US
imports of EC pasta, made from heavily subsidised wheat, have increased 70
per cent in the past decade.
Both the Uruguay Round and the oilseeds dispute are expected to be on the
agenda when Mr Frans Andriessen, the EC commissioner in charge of trade, and
other EC officials meet today with Mr James Baker, the US secretary of
state; Mrs Carla Hills, the US trade representative, and Mr Edward Madigan,
the US agriculture secretary.
Without a breakthrough Mrs Hills is likely to roll out a list containing
Dollars 2bn in sanctions for 30 days of public comment, after which the list
will be pared.
Mrs Hills talks of how she was promised 'with a handshake' that the
subsidies would be 'fixed' in time for the 1991 growing season. US patience
has been 'rather endless,' she said, but if the Gatt process is to have any
credibility, she must act.
The role of domestic politics cannot be dismissed. Mrs Hills says President
Bush has clung fast to his free-trade principles, though only 35-40 per cent
of US farmers support his position in the Uruguay Round.
There are no senators who do not have farmers in their districts, she said.
'There are some districts that are 100 per cent agricultural and could
indeed tip the election.'
The EC oilseeds programme, which set Community prices at about double the
prevailing world levels, was designed to draw Community farmers away from
surplus grain production. Between 1980-1990, EC producers more than tripled
the land area devoted to EC production of rapeseed, sunflower seed and
soyabeans, and boosted planting from 4m to 13m acres. At the same time US
exports of soyabeans fell 63 per cent.
In 1987 the American Soyabean Association gave up waiting for farm reform in
the Uruguay Round to solve the problem and filed a case against the EC
oilseeds regime, which the US trade representative took to the Gatt. After
many delays, a Gatt panel concluded in 1990 that the subsidies impaired the
advantage the EC had promised when in 1962 it agreed to 'bind' its oilseed
import tariffs at zero duty.
After more postponements, the EC revised its oilseeds regime. Instead of
making payments to oilseeds processors for using EC oilseeds, it would make
them directly to EC farmers. In the US view, this was an improvement because
the regime no longer discriminated against foreign oilseeds, but it still
subsidised production and thus devalued the advantage promised when zero
tariffs were negotiated.
The US returned to the Gatt, where a panel again found against the EC
oilseeds regime. The EC blocked adoption of the panel's report on April 30
but promised a 'concrete proposal' for settlement before the June 1992 Gatt
Council meeting. The US indicated that it would impose sanctions if the
proposal was not satisfactory.
EC officials, who complain that the US is impatient and impulsive, say the
Bush administration is acting 'totally without justification' and lacks
legal basis because the oilseeds report is still pending. American officials
see the EC as consistently delaying the inevitable; they believe that by
blocking the panel report the EC is violating the spirit of the Gatt and
they have the right to take action.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Caretaker government imposes further three-month freeze on
capital spending in Italy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S caretaker government yesterday imposed a further three-month freeze
on capital spending projects in a symbolic gesture to answer the EC's recent
harsh criticism of the country's public finances, writes Robert Graham.
In January, the government imposed for a six-month period a series of stiff
requirements for approval of capital spending projects to hold down the
public sector deficit, which was rising beyond 10.5 per cent of GDP. The
main effect of this measure was to permit the Treasury to scrutinise all
large investment requests and withhold approval unless ample justification
was provided. Yesterday's cabinet meeting extended this procedure until
September.
The saving will be little more than L1,000bn (Pounds 452.7m), against this
year's projected deficit of more than L165,000bn.  But the authorities were
anxious to signal to Brussels that public spending would be closely
monitored while a new government is being formed.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Italian 'Mr Clean' emerges from a dirty fight: Mr Oscar
Luigi Scalfaro, the new president, is the product of compromise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, who will be sworn in as Italy's ninth president on
Thursday, has a personality and style in sharp contrast to his predecessor,
Mr Francesco Cossiga.
Courteous, devoutly Catholic, and formal, the new president, 73, could not
be more different from the loquacious and unpredictable Mr Cossiga. Although
both have come to the presidency from the ruling Christian Democrat party,
Mr Scalfaro has always kept his distance from the inner cabals - unlike Mr
Cossiga.
Mr Cossiga rejoiced in his self-appointed populist role as 'the man with a
pick-axe', chipping away at a political system in urgent need of reform. Mr
Scalfaro projects the image of an impartial father figure, steering the ship
of state along the path of reform with the limited powers available to the
head of state. Mr Scalfaro was taken on as a 'Mr Clean'. Indeed, eyebrows
have been raised by his ultra-conservatism. When chosen as speaker of the
chamber of deputies after the April 5 general election, he had his office
sprinkled with holy water and in the past is credited with telling a woman
in a restaurant her decollete was too revealing.
Perhaps not surprisingly he and Mr Cossiga can scarcely speak to each other.
Mr Cossiga was deeply affronted when Mr Scalfaro became the new speaker
against his express wishes - a key element in the latter's resignation on
April 25, two months before his seven-year term was complete.
In his brief period as speaker, Mr Scalfaro impressed with his scrupulous
impartiality. When voting for the presidency began on May 13 he was
considered a potential compromise candidate, but it required 16 voting
sessions of the joint houses of parliament to endorse him in the final round
(there were 1,010 potential voters).
Although this may have seemed an unnecessarily long period to elect a new
head of state when the country was without a government, the election
process was treated by the parties as a dress rehearsal for the formation of
the next government. Thus the first three sessions tested whether the
outgoing four-party coalition of Christian Democrats, Socialists, Liberals
and Social Democrats could rely on their members to fall behind the
leadership choice.
This failed, as the Christian Democrats in particular were deeply divided.
The Christian Democrats then played their main card, proposing Mr Arnaldo
Forlani, the party secretary general, in the fifth and sixth vote. He
mustered no more than 479 votes, short of the 508 majority, and should have
won 60 votes more if all the coalition had backed him.
The failure of Mr Forlani was crucial. He received insufficient support
because he was too openly identified with a discredited system of Christian
Democrat-controlled power, out of touch with the reforming mood of the
country. The rebuff applied equally to another Christian Democrat
heavyweight, Mr Giulio Andreotti, the outgoing prime minister. Unable to
unite his party, Mr Forlani resigned last Friday.
The Forlani resignation symbolised the impotence of the ruling coalition and
allowed the search for a Christian Democrat compromise 'institutional'
candidate in the form of Mr Scalfaro.
Mr Scalfaro received 672 of the 1,002 votes present. This included the vote
of the former communist Party of the Democratic Left (PDS), the radicals and
the Greens, but not the republicans, who were upset that their strong
front-runner, Mr Giovanni Spadolini, the interim president, was passed over.
This voting alliance demonstrates that the politicians have taken on board
the public demand for electoral and institutional reform evident in the big
general election protest vote.
The politicians were also conditioned in their choice by the need to present
a 'clean' candidate in the light of growing public unease over the Milan
corruption scandal.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BELGRADE yesterday launched a diplomatic offensive to stave off
international sanctions by trying to distance itself from the war being
waged by Serbian forces in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Mr Branko Kostic, the acting president of the Serb-dominated Yugoslav
presidency, wrote to Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the United Nations secretary
general, appealing to all sides to allow the reopening of the airport in
Sarajevo and stop the bombardment of the Bosnian capital and Mostar (in
southern Bosnia). His move followed similar conciliatory statements
overnight from the federal presidency and government.
The airport has been under blockade since early April, first by the federal
army and now by Serbian irregulars.
Western diplomats said the statements represented attempts at improving
public relations rather than concrete steps to end the killing and
destruction in Bosnia.
'It is hot air,' said one diplomat. 'The presidency could take some real
steps. For example, it could order the Serbian army to hand over its
weapons.' Mr Kostic dismissed as 'psychological pressure' the possibility of
western military intervention.
'I think foreign countries will find it difficult to decide to send soldiers
to our country because of the possibility of them coming back in coffins,'
he said.
As Bosnian radio yesterday reported a lull in fighting around Sarajevo, the
Croatian President Franjo Tudjman has capitalised on the international
pressure which is mounting on Serbia by calling fresh parliamentary
elections.
The announcement by Mr Franjo Gregoric, the Croatian prime minister,
coincides with a revival in support for the ruling conservative Croatian
Democratic Union (HDZ), led by Mr Tudjman.
The HDZ won the republic's first free elections in April 1990.
Although Mr Tudjman has publicly supported the territorial integrity of
independent Bosnia, he has consistently backed plans by Bosnia's nationalist
Croats, led by Mr Mate Boban, and Bosnia's Serbs, led by Mr Radovan
Karadzic, to divide the republic between Serbia and Croatia. This would
leave the Moslems without a homeland.
Members of Croatia's opposition parties say international attention on the
war in Bosnia, and criticism of Serbia, has also allowed Mr Tudjman to crack
down on the media.
Mr Vladimir Seks, a parliamentary deputy, who was recently appointed state
prosecutor, has pressed charges against prominent members of the opposition
and journalists. They include Mr Ivan Zvonimir Cicak, head of the Croatian
Peasants Party, Mr Milorad Pupovac, head of the liberal Serbian Democratic
Forum, and Ms Jelena Lovric, a journalist at Danas, the Croatian weekly.
Under the criminal code, anyone found guilty of disseminating false
information, or causing disturbances of the public peace, can be imprisoned
for up to five years.

GERMANY has failed to overcome US objections to setting up a Franco-German
army corps despite providing assurances that obligations to Nato will not be
affected.
Mr Dick Cheney, US defence secretary, discussed the European Corps' role
with Mr Volker Ruhe, German defence minister, before a Nato planning meeting
here yesterday.
US officials said questions remained unanswered about the 'ultimate
allegiance' of the corps, launched officially at last week's Franco-German
summit. However, Mr Ruhe said later that the meeting of Nato defence
ministers produced 'no revolt' against the plan.
Germany was one of several allies expressing broad support for proposals to
enable the nine-nation Western European Union (WEU) to make use of military
formations which also had a Nato role.
The Netherlands and Italy backed UK proposals to make a range of both
multi-national and national forces available to the WEU. Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
UK defence secretary, said in a recent policy statement that the
Franco-German corps could play a part as one of the formations available,
alongside forces already existing in the Nato structure.
WEU foreign and defence ministers are expected to agree an outline forces
plan at a meeting in Bonn on June 19.
Belgium and Spain, which are both considering joining the Franco-German
corps, are discussing with other allies how else they might contribute to
the WEU initiative.
Britain has said that the use of forces by the WEU should be subject to
prior Nato consultation. However, it is understood to view this as a
precautionary measure to ensure that forces can be spared for operations
outside the Nato area, and not as a US right of veto over WEU operations.
The US is anxious to ensure that forces continue to be trained for their
Nato role. However, WEU members, who are in the process of setting up a
planning cell for military contingencies, foresee holding some exercises of
their own.
The Nato ministers also held preliminary talks on providing peacekeeping
forces for the 52-nation Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe
(CSCE).
Nato is agreed on the principle of making its resources and organisation
available for such operations if the CSCE takes on a regional UN
peacekeeping mission.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Soviet communist party to go on trial: Old regime likened to

THE communist party of the Soviet Union (CPSU) was yesterday sent for trial
for violations of the constitution of the Soviet Union, the state which it
created.
The trial, timed for July 7, will be a public judgment on the darkest
chapters of the history of the USSR since the 1917 revolution. Mr Andrei
Makarov, the legal counsel of Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian President, set
the tone when he likened the CPSU to the German Nazi Party - many of whose
leaders were put on trial at Nuremberg after the last war. Mr Gennady
Burbulis, Mr Yeltsin's top aide, said after the decision of the
Constitutional Court that further action might be taken against specific
leaders of the CPSU.
The decision of the court to, in effect, put the Party's history on trial
came ironically as a result of a suit brought to the court by communist
deputies, alleging that President Yeltsin's decrees banning the CPSU and the
Russian Communist Party after the August coup were unconstitutional.
This was countered by a cross suit brought by Mr Oleg Rumyantsev, leader of
the Social Democratic Party, that the CPSU had violated the Soviet
constitution.
The collegium of judges on the bench decided to unite both suits in one  -
to the vociferous protests of the many once senior communists in the court -
including Mr Yegor Ligachev, formerly number two in the politburo to Mr
Mikhail Gorbachev, and Mr Vladimir Ivashko, Mr Gorbachev's deputy at the
time of the coup.
The judgment, described by Mr Burbulis as 'brilliant', means that even if Mr
Yeltsin's decrees are ultimately judged unconstitutional, the country will
be convulsed by promised revelations on the party's murderous past. Mr
Gorbachev, the party's last general secretary and, in his role as president,
the man who presided over its dissolution, was not himself in court. Mr
Burbulis hinted that the court's decision would damage the former
president's efforts to rehabilitate himself when he said: 'I doubt he will
now engage in further political activity.'
Mr Valery Zorkin, the court's chairman, ruled that former party leaders,
including Mr Gorbachev, could represent the party if they wished. Mr
Yeltsin's side had argued that the party had no legal standing in the court
because of the ban on its activities. Mr Sergei Shakhrai, legal aide to Mr
Yeltsin, has already given a hint of the evidence to be brought against the
party when he produced a document on Monday which showed that the CPSU had
authorised shipments of weapons in 1975 to the Popular Front for the
Liberation of Palestine, the most militantly terrorist of the groups within
the Palestinian Liberation Organisation.
Mr Yeltsin said yesterday he would not resign from office during his current
term but did not plan to stand for a second spell in 1996, according to
Itar-Tass news agency.

THE Commonwealth of Independent States took a step closer to dissolution
yesterday when defence ministers of most of its member states agreed to
limit their joint military command to strategic nuclear weapons.
This means that the navy and air force, including the Black Sea fleet whose
possession is disputed between Russia and Ukraine, will now be divided among
the member states, with the bulk of it falling to Russia. Mr Ivan Bizhan,
Ukrainian defence minister, said all nuclear weapons had been removed from
the Black Sea fleet three weeks ago. Talks have begun between Ukraine and
Russia on the division of the fleet but there is no resolution in sight.
Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, the head of the CIS command, said the CIS
would continue to maintain and control the nuclear forces until they were
all returned to Russia. The other states with nuclear weapons - Belarus,
Kazakhstan and Ukraine - have agreed to do this by mid-1994.
There still appears to be disagreement between Russia and Ukraine on the
precise control of the nuclear warheads. General Leonty Kuznetsov, head of
the Russian general staff, said Russia had been delegated responsibility for
putting the nuclear forces on alert - and said that acts adopted by Ukraine
on administrative control of the nuclear warheads 'put their safety in
doubt'.
Marshal Shaposhnikov said the forces remaining under CIS control were the
strategic missiles; the strategic nuclear bombers; nuclear missile-carrying
warships; the anti-missile systems and the technical back-up to the nuclear
force.
Mr Boris Yeltsin, Russia's president, called last night for urgent talks on
the worsening conflict between national guards and forces of the Russian
minority in Moldova. Mr Mircea Snegur, the Moldovan president, warned on
Monday that his republic might have to declare a state of war with Russia
because of alleged involvement of the Russian 14th army on the side of
Russian forces in the self-proclaimed TransDnestr republic in the east of
Moldova.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (10): Sharper edge needed - Industry seeks a
wider technology base
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S rapid rise to a position in the world's top league of
semiconductor producers is testimony to its ability to acquire, develop and
manage high technology. Yet having scaled such technical heights in one of
the most demanding industrial fields, it is in danger of lagging behind its
competitors in the deployment of technology in the more mundane industries
that make up the bulk of its export sector.
'Increasing the level of technology in every field of industry is our top
priority,' says Mr Choi Gak Kyu, deputy prime minister and head of the
Economic Planning Board. 'Every industry needs to upgrade its technology. We
must deepen our industrial structure by substituting domestic output for
imports of components and materials.'
That industry is intent on applying more technology to offset higher labour
costs is evident from a surge in factory automation equipment imports, much
of it from Japan. These have been rising at annual rates of 20 per cent or
more in recent years, according to government statistics, and could amount
to more than Dollars 1bn in 1992.
Nor is there any doubt that technology transfer forms a part of virtually
every industrial deal with foreign companies, though some observers doubt
whether that such technology is always fully absorbed and efficiently
employed.
The growing network of government research laboratories boasts 'many people
who are as good as any in the world', according to western diplomats. And
industry spending on research and development has risen sharply in recent
years.
But there are question-marks over the corporate sector's R&amp;D efforts. Some
observers point to the behaviour of many of the big companies in 1986 and
1987, when they were flush with cash. The profits then went mainly into
speculative property and stock market dealings rather than into R&amp;D.
Some Korean companies, such as Samsung Electronics, have earned
international reputations for being at the cutting edge of semiconductor
technology. But the evidence is less clear that companies across the board
are investing the very large amounts in pure research and product
development which would be needed to lessen their ties to foreign, and
especially Japanese suppliers of components and high value equipment.
Mr Duck Soo Han, director general of the industrial policy bureau at the
Ministry of Trade and Industry, accepts that the 'technology gap won't be
solved easily'. But he contends that a combination of tax incentives, a
government policy to encourage collaboration and the importation of key
foreign technologies will help.
In addition, the government has identified strategic industries which it
believes will be the basis for South Korea's future competitiveness. These
include the following:
new generations of semi-conductors, including the development of a 64
Megabit Dram by 1993 and a 256 Megabit Dram by 1996;
development of a variety of high definition television equipment, including
HDTV monitors by 1993, transmission technology by 1994 and flat panel
displays by 1997;
the commercialisation of a multi-media computer by 1994.
Some critics, however, contend that the government plan is over-ambitious.
One European engineer familiar with the HDTV programme, for example,
believes that 'only a half a dozen Korean engineers really understand the
technology.'
Mr Choi denies that the high technology effort is spread too thinly, noting
that Korea's priorities fall well short of those in more developed
countries, where the emphasis is on 'fine chemicals, aerospace,
biotechnology and new materials'. He adds that 'decisions on R&amp;D projects
should equally consider economic viability as well as technological
feasibility.'
The relatively thin layer of engineering talent in the country has caused
some companies to search widely for new recruits. One of the most
technologically advanced companies, Samsung Electronics, is seeking to lure
Korean-Americans back to their former homeland. It is also trying to hire
Russian scientists and engineers, either individually or as a team, though
it has so far failed to reach any agreement.
'We don't care what nationality a person is,' says Mr Hun Kim, a senior
Samsung executive. But such sentiments may not be heard in the corridors of
other Korean conglomerates, which have a reputation for being highly
nationalistic.
They also have a reputation - among many western business executives atr
least - of being less than respectful of intellectual property rights and
for being reluctant to pay for foreign technology.
This is particularly the case when they are buying the innovative
engineering services which will be needed in ever-larger amounts, according
to Mr John Lyle, Seoul branch manager of HW Structures, part of the UK's
Hawtal Whiting Group.
He believes that the 'complexity of design and development is rarely
understood at government or senior management level', in large part because
Korean industry has had a manufacturing bias.
'There is still an emphasis on importing licensed technology and
manufacturing ready-made designs,' he says. 'Purchasing innovative
engineering services costs money and sometimes the effort needed to develop
these skills is not understood by Korean companies.' But Mr Lyle believes
Korean companies are beginning to understand that 'if you pay yesterday's
prices, then you get yesterday's technology'.
The sheer size and dominance of Korea's big companies can also deter
technology transfer. Dr Berthold Leibinger, president of the German
Machinery and Plant Manufacturers Association, the VDMA, said recently in
Seoul that German medium-sized companies found it hard to find suitable
Korean partners. 'It's very difficult for a German company with 500 or even
2,000 employees to deal with a Korean one employing 50,000,' he notes.
Government policy is to encourage the start-up of small, innovative
technology-based companies. But there may still be more than a grain of
truth in the joke which asks: 'What is the first thing a Korean entrepreneur
does?' The answer is: 'He goes to the States.'
Mr Choi at the EPA accepts that the shortage of small specialist suppliers
is a weakness which must be overcome, in part through a recently announced
loan programme. But government officials believe long-term technological
competitiveness can only come through the reform of the chaebols into more
focused entities.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (11): The All-Korean car is still some way
off - The motor industry is striving to reduce dependence on foreign
suppliers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH KOREA'S car manufacturers offer a case study of the challenges which
face the country's industry as a whole. All need to upgrade technology,
lessen dependence on foreign suppliers, diversify markets and establish new
relationships with their labour unions. And they need to overcome a period
of economic uncertainty, both at home and in their main export markets.
The myriad alliances, technical co-operation agreements and joint ventures
that bind Korea's carmakers to the world's leading manufacturers will remain
a hallmark of the industry for years to come. The advent of an 'all-Korean'
car created from a 'clean sheet of paper will have to await the next
century', says one western expert.
But the need to reduce dependence on foreign, and particularly Japanese
partners or suppliers for everything from basic designs to key components is
a priority for all manufacturers. So, too, is the need to move away from a
manufacturing bias, towards greater emphasis on higher value activities such
as design and product development.
Such a task will be neither easy nor cheap. 'Unlike Japan, Korea has only
pockets of automotive expertise', says Mr John Lyle of the UK's Hawtal
Whiting Group of consulting engineers. 'When we started (in Korea) we
noticed our clients' engineers did not gain much by studying the design
process because priority was given to developing products quickly.'
However, companies such as Hyundai, the industry leader, have invested
heavily in research and development facilities, where 'massive teams are
using state-of-the-art technology to develop new vehicles,' according to Mr
Lyle.
He predicts that the effort will result in 'a new range of Korean products
in the next five years', including light commercial vehicles and heavy
trucks. 'They will all be new designs or vehicles based on better platforms
than exist now,' he says.
The emphasis on independent projects stems in part from Korean
dissatisfaction with the high cost of royalties paid to foreign suppliers
and the limitations of technology transfer through the main international
alliances in the industry - Hyundai with Japan's Mitsubishi, Kia with Ford
and Mazda and Daewoo's now-defunct link-up with GM. But few observers expect
that Korean companies will be able to catch up in all areas.
'Great advancements have been made,' says Mr Dong Wha Lee, director of the
Korea Autombile Manufacturers Association, who cites the introduction last
year of a Hyundai-developed engine, and similar programmes in place at Kia
and Daewoo. But he concedes that the industry 'still lags behind' its
international competitors in many areas. These include systems such as air
bags, anti-lock braking systems and four-wheel drive.
Perhaps more worrying for Korea's technology effort, however, is the
international trend towards less environmentally damaging cars, the
development of which is beyond Korea's technical capabilities.
The quantum leap in the technical quality of Korean cars in recent years has
been matched by moves to upgrade their image in key export markets, though
that effort suffered badly when labour disputes affected the build quality
of Hyundai cars sold in the US.
Mr NM Kim, Hyundai's managing director for export marketing, acknowledges
that 'we have a perception problem in the US', where export sales dropped
from 260,000 units in 1986 to a current rate of just over 120,000 a year.
But he argues that the launch of the Elantra, which some experts describe as
'Korea's first good car', will improve Hyundai's US image.
Mr Kim also believes that Korean manufacturers must move away from the
'price-value market strategy', which has focused on undercutting the price
of rival products.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (9): Obstacles to growth / A look at efforts
to unblock the infrastructure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIT behind a crawling container truck choked by diesel fumes and dust on the
400km from Seoul and Pusan, and one becomes aware of the large sums of money
South Korea needs to spend on improving its inadequate infrastructure.
The journey along the congested highway between the country's two biggest
cities can be tedious.
In Seoul, the capital, congestion is even worse. The exhaust fumes of 1m
cars hangs like a pall over the city for much of the year. Traffic jams cost
hundreds of millions of dollars in lost production time adding to the
discontent of a people that wants its standard of living to rise in line
with economic growth.
The metropolitan area of Seoul houses 18m people, 43 per cent of the
country's population, and accounts for 59 per cent of South Korean
manufacturing output. Pusan in the south east is the country's biggest
seaport. Traffic between the two cities, therefore, is large.
Central government has estimated that road congestion in 1990 cost the
country Won1,200bn (Dollars 1.7bn) in wasted energy and lost time. The main
Seoul-Pusan rail link has already reached maximum capacity increasing the
potential for road congestion as distributors are forced to use container
lorries.
South Korean infrastructure in many areas is struggling to cope with the
rapid growth in the economy. Delays in cargo handling at the ports of Pusan
and Inchon are estimated to have cost the country a further Won700bn
(Dollars 1bn) in 1990. Kimpo airport, South Korea's leading airport handling
85 per cent of international passengers and 95 per cent of air freight, is
forecast to reach its maximum capacity in 1996.
The need for increased infrastructure spending is undeniable. Without higher
investment production bottlenecks will intensify and inhibit future growth.
Social unrest also is likely to increase as living standards come under
increasing pressure from inadequate services.
The government, in a bid to co-ordinate spending plans, has established a
special task force under the president, the Planning Agency for Social
Infrastructure Development (Pasid), to identify priority projects.
One of its major aims is to encourage greater investment away from
over-crowded cities to less economically successful areas, particularly the
south west of the country. Improvements in transport are regarded as
essential.
The task force has proposed that Won40 trillion (Dollars 52bn) be spent by
central government on infrastructure between now and 1996. More than half of
this is planned to be invested in roads and railways.
About Won19 trillion (Dollars 24.6bn) is expected to be spent on
constructing 450km of new roads and upgrading a similar length of existing
roads. The programme includes beginning work on three new motorways. The
most important is a 353km expressway, costing Won3 trillion, between Seoul
and Mokpo in the south west, the region which has been identified by the
government for expansion.
In the past, heavy emphasis has been placed on connecting Seoul with other
cities. The latest crop of motorways will instead connect regional cities
with each other including a 289km highway between Ch'unch'on and Taegu
costing Won2 trillion and a 160km motorway between Taejun and Chinju.
Investment in the south west will be further aided by the expansion of
Kwangyang which is intended to become a major seaport. There are also plans
for increased spending water services, power generation and land
development. The government hopes that this will encourage the private
sector to invest in new factories, offices and homes in the south west as
well as other less developed areas.
A further Won8 trillion (SDollars 10.3bn) is expected to be invested between
now and 1996 on upgrading and electrifying South Korea's railway network
including starting work on a high speed rail link between Seoul and Pusan
which is expected to cost Won5.8 trillion (Dollars 7.5bn) when it is
completed towards the end of the century.
Other high speed rail routes are planned including a link between Seoul and
Mokpo but these programmes have still to be allocated a budget.
There is also substantial investment planned in improved water and sewerage
facilities, a trebling in the size of the Seoul subway system and a large
power station building programme. As a result central government spending on
infrastructure as a proportion of GNP is forecast to almost double from 1.7
to 3 per cent between 1991 and 1996.
About Won7 trillion is planned to be spent on improving drinking water and
installing new water services. The government intends to extend sewage
treatment from about 35 per cent of the population to about 70 per cent by
the mid-1990s.
The Ministry of Energy and Resources, which has a separate budget funded out
of a special petroleum revenue tax, plans to invest Won70 trillion by the
year 2000 on new power stations and transmission equipment.
The country currently runs nine nuclear power stations. Last year, these
provided nearly half the country's electricity. By the year 2000, South
Korea expects to have another 11 nuclear stations either built or under
construction, making it one of the world's biggest users of nuclear power.
Funding such a vast programme will not be easy. Rising inflation caused by
over-heating in the economy means that the Korean government is seeking to
slow down the overall rise in construction output while leaving
infrastructure spending plans intact.
Restrictions on the issue of building permits for private residential and
commercial development have been introduced in a bid to reduce activity.
The controls which had been expected to be lifted in the Spring have been
extended. They are expected to remain in force at least until the end of the
year - such is the difficulty of restricting rises in construction output
which has been blamed for the doubling of the country's annual inflation
since 1985.
The aim is to restrict real increases in construction output, after allowing
for inflation, to between 3 per cent to 4 per cent a year between now and
1996. Current forecasts are that total construction output will rise by 7
per cent in real terms this year.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (6): Unnatural silence - Why the stock
exchange is still subdued
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KOREA'S reputation as the land of the morning calm may strike visitors
caught up in one of Seoul's rush hour traffic jams as singularly undeserved.
But it sums up the mood on the Korean stock exchange (KSE). Its performance
this year has been subdued despite the infusion of funds from abroad after
the limited opening of the market to foreign investors in January.
The composite index has hovered around the 600 level for much of the year,
compared with an all-time high of 1,008 in April 1989. Interest rates at
around 16 per cent, a relatively low GDP growth rate of about 7.5 per cent
and political uncertainty surrounding December's presidential election
explain the poor performance, according to local brokers.
Their foreign counterparts say the same factors have put off many
international investors, who have also been deterred by the remaining
government restrictions on their activities. These include a 10 per cent
limit on foreign ownership of individual shares and a three per cent ceiling
on holdings in a Korean company by any single foreign investor.
Other barriers to greater foreign participation include a requirement to
secure an investor identification number and a capital gains tax which has
proved to be a big deterrent to investors from Germany, Japan and Hong Kong,
countries which do not have double taxation treaties with South Korea.
Some foreign investors have also been annoyed at having to trade under their
real names, rather than through the usual nominees, though it appears that
this requirement is being eased, according to Mr Peter Thorn, the chief
representative in Seoul of brokers WI Carr.
Another factor which has dampened the interest of those investors who missed
the first wave of buying is the fact that foreign holdings in the most
liquid stocks quickly reached their ceiling, forcing latecomers to pay a
premium in the over-the-counter market. Ministry of Finance officials note,
however, that only 18 companies out of the 688 listed have reached their
foreign quotas.
Ministry figures show that foreigners invested Dollars 917m as of May 6,
while withdrawing only Dollars 125m. The net foreign position at the end of
April represented just 0.73 per cent of the market's capitalisation,
suggesting that government fears that a 'wall of Japanese money' would be
used to pick off the choicest bits of Korean industry were overstated.
The lacklustre performance of the composite index so far this year conceals
sharp price rises in the shares of some smaller companies, a sector in which
foreign buyers have been particularly active. Mr Thorn notes that the shares
of some smaller companies are trading on 'multiples of only six, seven or
eight and are extraordinarily cheap'.
The low price/earnings ratios are largely the result of the sector having
been ignored by domestic investors, who have traditionally focused instead
on the absolute price of the more liquid shares of large companies.
Foreign infatuation with the smaller companies has struck a welcome chord
with the government, which is keen to encourage greater capital flows to
small and medium-sized businesses as part of its policy to reduce the
economic dominance of big conglomerates.
The initial pattern and volume of investment from abroad has also done much
to calm government fears over the impact of market liberalisation, and has
strengthened the hand of those officials who would like to see the stock
exchange opened more widely to overseas funds.
Mr Philip Smiley, branch manager of Jardine Fleming Securities in Seoul,
says: 'The commitment shown by most foreign investors to stay in the market'
has largely dispelled government worries that 'hot money' from abroad would
wreak havoc in the domestic economy.
But few brokers, whether foreign or domestic, expect radical reforms to
replace the government's cautious approach. 'The officials have learned much
over the past three or four months', says Mr Thorn. 'The Ministry of Finance
is now saying to brokers 'how can we make things better?' But there is still
a reluctance to give up control.'
The government is under pressure from foreign brokers to raise the 10 per
cent limit on overseas ownership to 25 per cent, according to Mr Duncan
Ross, manager of Baring Securities in Korea. But a senior finance ministry
official countered that 'it is a little hasty to talk about expansion after
only five months', and said investors 'should not expect such a decision
this year'.
The lack of movement on the issue is unlikely to stop the steady inflow of
foreign funds, but it leaves the KSE standing out among other Asian markets,
such as Hong Kong, where large international investors can move in and out
of big blocks of highly liquid stocks with ease.
US-based investors, in particular, have been put off by the lack of
opportunities to invest Dollars 5-10m in one stock, according to Mr Smiley.
The fact that Erisa-regulated US pension funds have been unable to comply
with Korea's standing proxy rule, which conflicts with accepted American
practice, has also been a barrier to US investment. But Ministry of Finance
officials say a change in the rules this month should solve the problem.
Nonetheless, US investors represented 20.2 per cent of total foreign
investment at the end of April, while their British-based counterparts
accounted for 42.3 per cent. New Zealand, through which some Hong Kong money
is reportedly funnelled to avoid the Korean capital gains tax, represented
14.2 per cent of the total. But Japanese investors had come forth with
little more than Dollars 1m, according to the ministry.
The simplification or removal of the remaining regulatory restrictions will
continue to be a top priority of the government, according to Mr Kim
Tae-hyun, the director of the Ministry's Securities Policy Division. But he
concedes that there has been 'no progress' on the avoidance of double
taxation for Japanese, German and Hong Kong investors.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (8): The advantages of North-South links -
How to restore industrial competitiveness
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF South Korea's industrialists had their way, the hesitant diplomatic
dalliance between North and South would give way to an early economic
bearhug.
The most optimistic of the southern visionaries see close economic links
with the North as the basis for a resurgence of international
competitiveness. Such co-operation, say its proponents, would give South
Korea the best of two seemingly contradictory economic worlds.
First, it could restore Korea's declining competitiveness in traditional
export items such as footwear and clothes by shifting production to the
North, instead of to low wage countries in Southeast Asia. The application
of even modest South Korean technology to the North's abundant supply of
cheap and disciplined labour would lead to big productivity gains, say many
Seoul economists.
They believe that once such low-end but still lucrative export markets were
secured, South Korean industry would be more confident about undertaking
risky investments in high-technology areas.
A by-product of the process would be the economic upliftment of 20m North
Koreans, who would constitute a virtually captive consumer market for the
south's industry. In addition, southern access to the North's mineral and
other natural resources would lessen its dependence on imports, while
defence spending, which constitutes a quarter of government expenditure,
could be reduced substantially.
Such a rosy scenario, however, assumes an orderly development of links with
the the North, rather than any sudden lurch towards unification and the
attendant risks of massive economic dislocation. And it may underestimate
the difficulty of working within the North's troubled economy.
Figures from the Economic Planning Board (EPB) in Seoul suggest that North
Korea's gross national product shrank by 3.7 per cent in 1990, when it was
hit by raw material and oil shortages caused by a change from barter to hard
currency trade with the former Soviet Union. Mr Byung-Bae Kim, director of
the EPB unit monitoring the North's economy, guesses that growth last year
was 'at best at a standstill'.
The government-funded Korea Development Institute estimates that the North's
GNP was Dollars 27.3bn in 1990, about a tenth of the South's, while GNP per
head was Dollars 1,273, a fifth of the Dollars 5,569 official figure for
South Korea.
Trade between the two economies has been minimal, and has generally been
carried out through third countries such as China, Japan and Singapore. EPB
figures for intra-Korean trade last year indicate that the South received
Dollars 166m worth of goods - mostly non-ferrous minerals, gold, silver and
coal - while sending Dollars 26m worth of mainly chemicals, textiles and
home appliances to the North. Mr Kim says the growth of direct trade will
depend on the pace of North-South talks this year, though a tentative
agreement has been reached to set up a clearing account to facilitate
greater exchanges. However, agreements on the avoidance of double taxation,
commercial arbitration and the protection of investments will be required
before Seoul approves the first joint ventures, he says.
The need for additional negotiations has not put off southern
industrialists, especially those who believe they can create on their own
doorstep a Korean version of southern China's fast-growing Guangdong
province.
Mr Kim Woo-Chung, founder and chief executive of Daewoo Group, made a
much-publicised trip to the North last January, during which he tentatively
agreed to set up joint ventures in a number of light industries at the
special economic zone which North Korea has proposed building at the port of
Nampo. He also discussed mining projects and a scheme in which 10,000 North
Korean workers would be used on a Daewoo contract to build a highway in
Pakistan.
The other big conglomerates, including Hyundai, whose founder was born in
the North, are said to be equally keen despite a lack of hard information
about the state of North Korean industry. Daewoo's Mr Kim Woo-Chung reported
that productivity at the factories he visited seemed to be about half that
of equivalent plants in the South, though he predicted that North Koreans
would have little difficulty in adapting to more modern technology.
Rivalry among the Korean conglomerates (and possibly foreign companies) to
secure North Korean partners is likely to be heightened by the fact that
most industrial sectors have only a few main companies, thus encouraging
early link-ups.
The Seoul government says it will gauge the success of small-scale joint
ventures before approving any big industrial projects or partnerships with
the North. And it will need to know much more about the soundness of
individual North Korean companies, says Mr Kim at the EPB.
But Pyongyang has made it clear that it has an ambitious development agenda
of its own. Mr Kim Dal-hyon, the North Korean deputy prime minister
responsible for the economy, said recently that Pyongyang would welcome
broader foreign investment. He said the invitation included investment from
the US although that would have to await a resolution of the nuclear issue
and the lifting of a US ban on most commercial contacts with the North.
Such statements, however, indicate just how far the North Korean government
is prepared to go to attract foreign investment, which it believes can be
confined to the SEZs or other specific areas, such as proposed tourist
developments in mountainous areas revered by both North and South Koreans.
South Korean companies accept that that will be the pattern for the first
projects. But many economists in Seoul doubt whether Pyongyang can keep the
bulk of its population isolated from foreign influences for long, especially
as industrial logic will dictate the location of any large-scale projects.
In the longer term, the focus for South Korean and foreign investment in
North Korea could switch to the Tumen River basin along the border with
China and Russia. A plan put forward by the United Nations Development
Programme calls for the phased construction of a cross-border free trade
zone near the mouth of the river. The zone would then serve as the base for
developing the vast natural resources of the sparsely-populated hinterland
of the region.
Regular talks, which include South Korean and Mongolian representatives, are
being held on ways of developing such a zone, which the UNDP estimates could
cost Dollars 30bn over 15-20 years.
That kind of talk clearly excites South Korean companies. It also pleases
their government, which views any development that promises the orderly
opening up of the North as positive. 'Recent events in Germany show us that
unification can take any form and can proceed at any speed,' says Mr Kim at
the EPB. 'There will always be a painful transition, but the costs can be
much lower if the process is orderly.'

FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (7): World's fifth city - The population
boom has put strains on Seoul
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN Seoul marks its 600th anniversary as the Korean national capital in
1994, it will also be celebrating its position as the fifth biggest city in
the world with a population approaching 11m.
The city's role as an important Asian urban centre is expected to grow
during the next decade, especially if the two Koreas are reunited. By 2001,
its inhabitants are expected to number 14m.
But Seoul's phenomenal and rapid expansion since the end of the Korean war
in 1953 has brought a host of urban ills in its wake. 'Our biggest problems
are transportation, housing, pollution and refuse collection,' says Seoul
Mayor Rhee Hai-won. Those problems stem from the population explosion the
city has experienced in the past 35 years.
While the city's population stood at 1.5m in 1955, it swelled rapidly
thereafter as the country embarked on a massive industrialisation programme,
with factories concentrated in the main cities. As early as 1963, the
population had already doubled to 3m and the city's boundaries were also
doubled to accommodate the inflow of people moving from rural areas. The
result was the transformation of Seoul from a compact city of traditional
one-storey wooden houses into an urban sprawl dominated by high-rise
buildings and the brownish haze of air pollution.
In the process, Seoul has lived up to its name, which means capital in
Korean, by becoming the focal point for all aspects of Korean society. The
greater Seoul region, which also includes the port city of Inchon and other
towns in the surrounding province of Kyonggi, has more than 18m people,
accounting for almost 45 per cent of the South Korean population.
The region is responsible for more than half of the national economic
output, with 60 per cent of the country's industrial facilities located
there. Besides being the political, corporate, financial and media capital
of South Korea, the Seoul region has almost three-fifths of the nation's
universities and close to half its theatres.
The speed of the city's growth has defeated earlier attempts to control its
development. Urban planning 'was difficult because conditions were changing
so quickly,' explains Mayor Rhee. The city adopted in 1990 a master plan
that establishes guidelines until the turn of the century. But the
possibility of unification could also render these proposals obsolete since
it could lead to changes in population growth and a shift in expansion to
areas north of the city.
The fastest growing area of Seoul since the 1970s has been the Kangnam
region south of the Han river, which bisects the city as the Thames does
London.
While 80 per cent of Seoulites lived in the Kangbuk district north of the
Han in 1966, the city's population is now evenly divided between both sides
of the river. The construction of the stadia and other facilities south of
the Han for 1988 Olympic Games helped accelerate the population move across
the river, while transforming Kangnam into the preferred residential area
for the city's middle class.
The development of Kangnam has been accompanied by efforts to create
specialised districts within the area that would form the core for several
satellite communities. For example, most national government offices have
been moved to Kwachon, just south of the city boundary.
The city has built 400,000 housing units, most of them south of the Han, in
the last three years, raising the total number of housing units in the city
to 1.68m. Another 900,000 housing units are planned to be built by 2001 as
demand increases due to the disappearance of the extended family living
under one roof.
Officials, however, hope that the city's population may reach only 12m,
instead of the projected 14m, by the turn of the century if more people are
encouraged to live outside the city's boundaries.
One means of further dispersing the population would be the construction of
a high-speed rail link between Seoul and Pusan. This would bring the cities
of Chonan and Taejon within 40 minutes' commuting distance of Seoul and make
them more attractive places to live for those working in the capital.
But Seoul must still solve its transport problems, which now make commuting
a nightmare. Its roads are inadequate to handle the vehicles that carry 75
per cent of the passenger traffic within the city. Congestion is becoming
worse as the number of cars reaches 1.4m, although half of the 18m daily
commuting trips in Seoul are still made on buses.
'Our most important project in the 1990s is to expand the subway system and
make it the main means of travelling in the city,' says Mr Chang Seok Hyo,
director of the city planning division of the Seoul Metropolitan Authority.
The four lines of the Seoul subway, with 168.5km of track, now carry 25 per
cent of the city's passenger traffic. Another four lines will be added by
1996 at a cost of Won6.6 trillion, increasing the size of the system to
332.6km. This should handle about half of the passenger traffic.
The addition of a further 120km of track by 2001, which will make the Seoul
system as extensive as Tokyo's and one of the largest in the world, will
raise its share of passenger traffic to 75 per cent, the same as that now
handled by the Tokyo network.
But the system is already overwhelmed during rush hours, with passengers
squeezed into carriages. Officials hope to add more carriages to trains and
introduce more frequent services. Improved maintenance of carriages and the
subway's power system will reduce delays.
But the importance of the subway system goes beyond reducing road traffic.
The future growth of Seoul will be planned around it, with stations serving
as the nuclei for new residential neighbourhoods. The subway will be
connected to commuter rail lines, which also need to be expanded to reach
outlying districts.
The city hopes to confine more road traffic to the suburbs and plans to
build several circular roads to keep vehicles outside the centre. Another
proposal to reduce surface traffic is the construction of four long road
tunnels underneath central Seoul that would allow drivers to go quickly from
one end of the city to the other.
The Won2.4 trillion project, however, has been criticised as wasteful.
'There is opposition to it on both safety and environmental grounds,'
concedes Mayor Rhee, 'but I believe that the critics are wrong.' The city
plans to start construction of the first tunnel in the second half of 1993.
The reduction of road traffic is seen as one means to lower air pollution
levels. The Seoul master plan also calls for moving industrial plants away
from the city. Other anti-pollution measures include replacing coal and oil
as an energy source with liquid natural gas. Water quality will be improved
with the construction of new reservoirs and sewage treatment plants. This
follows the cleaning up of the Han River.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (5): The target is a triple seven - Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OPTIMISM is increasing that South Korea's overheated economy is gradually
cooling down. Although the country had an enviable growth rate of 8.4 per
cent last year, the brisk economic activity fueled a high inflation rate of
9.7 per cent, steep market interest rates of 17.8 per cent and a widening
current account deficit of Dollars 8.8bn as import growth outpaced exports.
These are worrying statistics for a country whose livelihood is heavily
dependent on exports in spite of the growing importance of the domestic
market. South Korea's international competitiveness has been eroded in the
last five years by a jump in wages as workers sought to keep up with higher
consumer prices and climbing housing costs. The inflationary pressure was
fuelled by an expansion of the money supply.
However, the government claims that 1992 will mark the turning point in
regaining control. 'The Korean economy is in a process of readjustment. We
are not pessimistic about its prospects,' says Mr Kim Chong In, a legislator
who recently served as the senior presidential secretary for economic
affairs.
The Economic Planning Board (EPB), the main economic policy agency, speaks
of achieving a triple seven economy this year, meaning a 7 per cent growth
rate, 7 per cent inflation, and a Dollars 7bn current account deficit. That
assessment can probably be dismissed as election talk and even the
government is hesitating to adopt these targets as its official goal.
There are encouraging signs that South Korea is approaching the EPB
guidelines, although still falling short of them. The economy grew by 7.6
per cent during the first quarter. The inflation rate of 2.6 per cent during
the period was almost half that of the 4.9 per cent rate a year ago. The
current account deficit shrank by 14 per cent to Dollars 3.2bn as the growth
in exports surpassed that for imports, narrowing the trade deficit by 23 per
cent to Dollars 2.6bn.
The Korean Development Institute (KDI), the government-affiliated research
organisation, recently revised its forecast for the year based on the
favourable first-quarter results. It predicts a gross national product
growth rate of 7.5 per cent, an inflation rate of 8.7 per cent and a current
account deficit of Dollars 8.4bn. But some of the reasons for the
improvement should still make government officials pause.
The slowdown in economic growth is mainly due to cut backs in fixed
investment rather than personal consumption. The government has clamped down
on the construction spree, which was a main source of economic expansion in
the last few years. The state is curtailing residential investments
following the completion of its three-year programme to construct 2m housing
units, while commercial and infrastructure projects are less affected by
investment restrictions.
The growth rate in construction is expected by the KDI to be halved to 5.4
per cent this year. The growth in industrial investments is declining from a
rate of 12.8 per cent in 1991 to an estimated 9.7 per cent in 1992,
reflecting the economic slowdown and high interest rates. This follows
several years of healthy industrial investments as Korean companies sought
more automation in their factories.
The growth in personal consumption remains stubbornly high, with the KDI
predicting an increase of 8.8 per cent against a 9.2 per cent rise in 1991.
The government has vainly sought to curb consumer spending, which has been
bolstered by wage rises and money earned in the speculative property market
over the last few years.
The state has sponsored an austerity campaign that has focused on
conspicuous consumption, including the purchase of imported luxury goods.
But this has had only a marginal impact. The slight fall in private
consumption expected this year is mainly the result of slower growth in
disposable income caused by high inflation and lower wage increases.
The economic slowdown is expected to narrow the trade deficit and the
current account deficit. Exports grew by 11 per cent to Dollars 16.8bn in
the first quarter of 1992 due to increased shipments of cars, ship and
petrochemical products, outpacing the 6.6 per cent rise in imports to
Dollars 19.5bn.
South Korea will have difficulty sustaining this performance. Lower oil
prices were largely responsible for the decreased import growth in the first
quarter. A year ago, South Korea was stockpiling oil in response to the Gulf
crisis as oil prices were hitting their peak. KDI expects imports to rise by
9.7 per cent to Dollars 85.6 per cent this year, against a 16.7 per cent
increase in 1991, due to falling purchases of capital goods from abroad.
Exports will rise by 10.4 per cent to Dollars 77.5bn, reflecting a gradual
recovery in the global economy and a depreciation of the won.
Exports could grow faster if South Korea managed to tame inflation, which is
the government's number one economic priority, according to Mr Choi Gak Kyu,
the vice-minister and head of the EPB. The battle against inflation rests on
tighter fiscal and monetary policies on the demand side and containment of
wage increases on the cost side. That may be a tough task to achieve in an
election year and with the government's authority weakened by its
disappointing result in the National Assembly elections two months ago.
The government is seeking to cap wage growth at 5 per cent during this
year's pay negotiations. Most independent economists believe the actual rise
will be closer to 10 per cent, although this is still down from the 20 per
cent annual pay growth that workers received in the late 1980s.
The government is arguing that wage demands should be lower since housing
prices are starting to fall. It claims this is the result of its plan to
build 2m housing units in 1988-91, although critics contend the project
helped fuel inflation and drove up wages as workers fled industry for more
lucrative construction jobs.
The government must resist the temptation to increase the money supply in an
election year. It has committed itself to limit this year's growth in the M2
measure of money to 18.5 per cent against 18.6 per cent in 1991. This
follows an average growth rate of 19 per cent in the second half of the
1980s.
Mr Cho Soon, the Bank of Korea governor, is dedicated to a tight monetary
policy and is willing to see companies go bankrupt to maintain it. That view
could prove unpopular with his political masters at the Ministry of Finance.
Pressure on the ministry from senior government officials to ease lending,
at least to small and medium businesses, could increase as the wave of
expected bankruptcies mounts in the approach to the presidential election in
December. Some members of the ruling Democratic Liberal Party argue that
monetary policy should remain flexible.
They argue that an excessively tight money supply could slow growth below
the 6.8 per cent to 7.2 per cent range that is considered optimal by the EPB
to absorb the country's young labour force.
Another obstacle to keeping the money supply under control is the seepage of
money from the country's sizeable underground economy.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (4): Hard lesson from Germany - Seoul avoids
haste over reunification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE two Koreas are agreed on one subject: they both want to avoid North
Korea being rapidly absorbed by the South.
It is ironic that officials in Seoul, who once hoped for a quick downfall of
the Pyongyang government, now have an interest in preserving it for at least
another decade while the two Koreas gradually integrate.
'We may once have wished for the North Korean government's instability, but
then we saw what happened between East and West Germany. We have learned our
lesson,' said Mr Yu In Teak, who is a director of analysis at the National
Unification Board, the cabinet-level agency responsible for relations
between the two Koreas.
The South Korean government sent dozens of study teams to Germany in the
wake of its reunification. It convinced Seoul that a rapid takeover by South
Korea of the north, if it suddenly collapses as its economic problems mount,
would be disastrous.
'Our economy couldn't cope with a quick unification. We would face
bankruptcy,' said Mr Tae Hwan Ok, the director of research at the Research
Institute for National Unification, the government advisory agency on the
unification issue.
Mr Ok estimates the cost to South Korea of supporting the North at between
Dollars 30bn-Dollars 50bn annually during the first decade if unification
occured soon. He said that unification should take not place until at least
2020 if Seoul wanted to avoid adverse economic consequences.
Although Mr Ok's analysis is more pessimistic than most, other studies have
concluded that South Korea would pay a heavy price for early unification.
The Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU) conservatively estimates that South
Korea would have to spend between Dollars 15bn-Dollars 26bn annually in the
1990s to improve North Korea's industrial base and infrastructure and
provide social services.
A report by the Korean Development Institute (KDI), the
government-affiliated think tank, concluded that even if unification were
postponed until 2001, the Seoul government would need to spend Dollars 240bn
during the following decade to support an unreformed North Korea.
'Unification presents us with more difficult problems than it did to
Germany,' said Mr Ok. South Korea's population is only twice the size of the
North's, while West Germans outnumbered East Germans by 4:1. North Korea's
industrial structure is much worse than East Germany's, while the rebuilding
of its road and rail network will take longer because of North Korea's
mountainous terrain.
The most important difference between Korean and German unification is that
South Korea is poorer than West Germany. While Bonn spends about 10 per cent
of its budget on unification, the costs involved in a rapid absorption of
North Korea would consume more than half Seoul's budget of Dollars 44.5bn.
Consequently, taxes would have to be raised, while the country's debt would
increase as Seoul sought foreign loans to finance the restructuring of the
north. The overseas expansion of the South Korean business groups, or
chaebol, would be blunted as they concentrated on developing industries in
the north.
There is concern about the psychological gap between the two Koreas. The
isolation of North Koreans, who have almost no access to information from
abroad, means that 'the difference in attitudes between North and South
Koreans has become immense,' said Mr Yu.
The daunting task that awaits South Korea has persuaded officials that
gradual unification is the only course. They claim that the public feels the
same way. 'Reunification is a sensitive and volatile issue because there is
a strong emotional urge to see our country become one again,' argued Mr Kim
Hakjoon, the chief press secretary for President Roh Tae Woo. 'But the
German example has given the people a more realistic attitude toward
reunification.'
The government believes the pace of economic integration will accelerate
once the issue of North Korea's nuclear programme is resolved. 'North Korea
will not be able to withstand the diplomatic pressure being exerted from all
sides to open its nuclear facilities to full inspection. We expect the
nuclear issue will no longer be an obstacle by the end of the summer,' said
Mr Kim.
Economic co-operation would consist of growing inter-Korean trade,
participation in infrastructure projects such as development of the Tumen
River basin, and the establishment of South Korean light manufacturing
factories in North Korea.
This should improve North Korea's industrial base and lead to higher living
standards, which are one-fifth of those of South Korea on a per capita of
gross national product basis. The KDI predicts that if sufficient economic
progress is made in North Korea, then unification in 2001 would cost the
Seoul government about Dollars 90bn by 2010.
The opening of the North Korean economy would be accompanied by moves toward
a confederal linking of the two Koreas. Controls would be maintained on
labour movements between the two halves of the peninsula during this
transition phase, while the two currencies would remain separate but traded
at a fixed rate. Political co-operation would eventually lead to de jure
unification after the turn of the century.
The success of this plan outlined by Seoul depends on the North Korean
government reforming itself in step with the economy, while the population
remains patient with the slow improvement in their living standards.
Economic reform would not unleash the popular uprisings that characterised
the eastern European bloc in 1989-91 because the North Korean internal
controls are comprehensive and the population docile, said Mr Yu.
Some independent analysts believe that Seoul's plan of gradual rapprochement
is unlikely to succeed. Mr Aidan Foster-Carter, director of the Leeds
University Korea Project and author of the EIU report, Korea's Coming
Reunification, said that North Korea would probably collapse economically
and politically by 1995 much as East Germany did in 1989.
He predicted that Kim Jung Il would not last long as North Korea's leader
after the death of his father, Kim Il Sung. Although his successors would be
more reform minded, the changes needed to revive the North Korean economy
and keep the population satisfied would be too great to undertake on a
gradual basis. The inability of the North Korean system to respond to the
economic crisis would leave no alternative but for Seoul to absorb the
country at once.
Mr Foster-Carter said that South Korea had several advantages over Germany.
The strong role of the state would make it easy to co-ordinate government
and corporate investments in North Korea, while the potent appeal of Korean
nationalism and Confucian values would encourage Koreans to share the burden
of unification without much protest. Against all the odds, Seoul would be
able to handle an early unification due to these sociological factors, he
concluded.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (3): Threatened by China - Trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT CORZINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
KOREANS have long been used to living between a geo-political hard place and
a rock, squeezed as they are between China and Japan. They are now finding
to their dismay that the trade position with these two big neighbours is
equally uncomfortable.
Japan alone accounted for 90 per cent of South Korea's Dollars 9.6bn trade
deficit last year, confirming that industry remains dependent on Japanese
equipment and components in spite of efforts to diversify suppliers. A 2.1
per cent drop in the value of exports suggests that South Korean companies
are finding it hard to compete in Japan against Japanese branded goods made
in south-east Asia.
The Chinese threat is a new one, with low-cost goods making inroads into
Korea's domestic market as well as undermining its exports to Japan and
elsewhere.
A loss of market share in some sectors in the US has added to Korea's
discomfort, and there is little prospect of early relief from Washington's
allegations of dumping and complaints about market access.
A partial solution to these problems, according to Mr Deuk-Hwan Yu, the
assistant minister for trade policy, is export market diversification, a
trend which is beginning to be discernible.
Ministry of Trade and Industry (MTI) figures show that the trade deficit for
the first quarter of 1992 narrowed to Dollars 3.84bn from Dollars 4.33bn in
the same period last year. This, officials say, was largely due to increased
exports to markets such as south-east Asia, which in March overtook the US
as Korea's largest export area.
There have been sharp increases in trade with the European Community and
central and eastern Europe. Other areas which are seen as priorities for
further development are the Middle East, South America and Africa. However,
South Korean officials concede that none of these regions offers the
potential of the US and Japan.
In addition, areas such as the EC, with a variety of cultures and languages,
pose problems for individual Korean companies, most of whom are accustomed
to the homogenous markets of the US and Japan. Mr Gilles Anouil, the EC
representative in Seoul, notes that Europe 'wasn't even on the map' for most
Korean companies until 1989, when the Economic Planning Board produced its
first report on the single market.
Bilateral trade has increased by 35 per cent over the past two years as
electronics and car manufacturers began to see western Europe as an antidote
to a sluggish US market. But the rise has not been without rancour. Korean
officials say they are still concerned that 'EC integration could result in
a fortress mentality'. And a senior MTI official contends that there are
'too many EC anti-dumping cases against Korean companies and the penalties
are too high'.
The need to avoid such actions is one factor behind increased Korean
interest in direct investment in Europe, according to Dr Moon-Soo Kang of
the Korea Development Institute. He believes businesses 'are beginning to
understand that they need a presence in the EC' to complement trade links.
Mr Anouil has detected a change in attitude, and says 'most of the big
companies accept that trade and investment now go hand in hand'.
The number and size of Korean investments in Europe are relatively low.
Official figures show that Europe accounted for only 112 of the 1,463 direct
foreign investments made by Korean companies up to June 1991.
The high cost of western European labour, even relative to the US, accounts
for some of the reluctance on the part of Korean companies to invest in the
EC. The opening up of eastern Europe, on the other hand, has generated a
good deal of interest.
This is explained in part by the fact that the Seoul government has been
keen to make inroads in countries which had formerly maintained close
relations with North Korea. Added to this has been the prospect of using
eastern Europe as a low-cost assembly and production centre, primarily for
exporting into the EC.
Some deals have materialised, such as Samsung's decision to build
refrigerators in Czechoslovakia. But Mr Anouil says many Korean companies
are having second thoughts about rapid expansion in eastern Europe.
Financial constraints, including high domestic interest rates and
restrictions on overseas borrowing, are considerable. In addition, the Seoul
government has rejected business requests for support to enable them to
participate more extensively in eastern European privatisations.
The parlous state of some eastern European industries is a deterrent.
Samsung Electronics, for example, continues to study prospects in the
region, but it has determined not to 'set up production facilities in a
country without a basic electronics industry, no matter how low the wages
are'.
The lure of the US is proving hard to break. Mr Joon-Suk Jung, director of
MTI's Europe division, says Korean companies still find the 'US much easier
compared with the EC, let alone eastern Europe'.
An early economic recovery in the US could slow the diversification drive,
although it is unlikely to reverse it. The persistence of potentially
disastrous trade disputes with the US, such as the latest allegation that
Korean semiconductor manufacturers are dumping memory devices in the US
market, is an incentive to maintain the policy.
So is the possible message behind the recent loss of market share in the US
and Japan. As a Western diplomat said: 'A country's performance in the free
business environment of the US measures its current competitiveness, while
the performance in Japan tells you how it will do in future.'

FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (2): A tale of two Kims - The presidential
battle is warming up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS fairly easy to predict who will be South Korea's next leader. He will
be called President Kim, a former dissident leader and a perennial aspirant
for the post. He stood in the 1987 election and lost, but saw his
determination rewarded in the 1992 polls.
The only question that prediction fails to address is which President Kim it
will be: Mr Kim Young Sam, the presidential candidate of the ruling
Democratic Liberal Party (DLP), or Mr Kim Dae Jung, the nominee of the main
opposition Democratic Party.
The answer is likely to be determined by the performance of a third
candidate in the presidential race at the end of the year. He is Mr Chung Ju
Yung, the billionaire founder of the Hyundai business group who recently
established the Unification National Party (UNP).
Conventional wisdom suggests that Mr Kim Young Sam still has the best chance
to gain entry into the presidential Blue House. One factor favouring him is
the 38.5 per cent vote share the DLP received in the National Assembly
election in March, the largest of any political party.
The parliamentary results indicated that support for the government may be
even wider. Most of the elected independents, who received 11.5 per cent of
the vote, were pro-government conservatives who had lost the DLP nomination
in their constituencies.
Mr Kim could receive half of the votes if the parliamentary voting patterns
are repeated in the presidential election. A plurality of votes is needed to
be elected president. President Roh Tae Woo, who is constitutionally barred
from standing again, won with 36 per cent in 1987 against the two Kims.
The irony with this analysis is that the DLP suffered a humiliating setback
in the National Assembly ballot, as their dominant parliamentary position
was reduced to a bare majority in the 299-seat legislature. This reflected
public dissatisfaction with the faltering economy.
The loss could have cost Mr Kim, who managed the parliamentary campaign, the
DLP presidential nomination. But he threatened to defect with his 25-member
legislative faction from the DLP, which would have deprived the government
of its parliamentary control, if he was denied the nomination.
His only challenger, Mr Lee Jong Chan withdrew from the race after alleging
that pressure was being exerted on delegates by the party's leadership to
support Mr Kim. Mr Lee, a popular MP from Seoul, is considering an
independent bid that could erode Mr Kim's support and could split the DLP.
Mr Kim's great strength is that he represents stability and continuity,
which still appeals strongly to Korean voters in spite of their growing
disenchantment with the political establishment. His political base is the
port city of Pusan in the south-eastern Kyongsang region, the area that has
produced all of South Korea's political leaders.
Regionalism is highly influential in Korean politics. It appears certain
that a President Kim, due to his political weakness within the DLP, would
keep in power the senior bureaucrats recruited by President Roh from his
native Kyongsang city of Taegu.
Mr Kim's handicap is that he has become unpopular due to his political
machinations in the last few years. The one-time opposition leader merged
his Reunification Democratic Party with President Roh's party to form the
DLP in 1990. This helped give the government a parliamentary majority, a
position it had lost two years previously.
The apparent incentive for Mr Kim's action was a promise that he would be
the DLP presidential nominee in 1992. But the public viewed Mr Kim's support
of the government as a negation of their democratic will expressed in the
1988 National Assembly elections, a factor that contributed to the DLP's
setback in March.
Mr Kim could become a victim of rising public cynicism about the country's
political leadership. One recent poll revealed that more than half the
public was dissatisfied with the two established political parties. It is
the main reason why Mr Chung's UNP has attracted considerable support in the
few months since its creation. DLP officials fear that Mr Chung's candidacy
will split the conservative vote, delivering the election to Mr Kim Dae
Jung.
Mr Chung is an unlikely candidate to attract protest votes. He is the
76-year-old autocratic founder of Hyundai, South Korea's second largest
conglomerate or chaebol. The chaebol are regarded by the public with
suspicion because of their close links with the country's earlier
authoritarian governments. For example, Mr Chung asked the government to use
the police to suppress strikes at Hyundai plants in the 1980s.
Mr Chung has still proved adept in tapping the public discontentment about
the political establishment.
He has adopted an unashamedly populist approach in his well-financed
parliamentary and presidential campaigns. He promises to reduce housing
rents and reverse South Korea's trade deficit with Japan, the country's
former disliked colonial master. He pledges to reform the financial system
that has benefited his family.
Although government efforts to curb the chaebol are one reason for Mr
Chung's new political role, he has recently spoken in favour of limiting
their economic power. That sentiment sits uneasily with the UNP's avowed
goal of reducing the state's economic controls.
'It isn't business that should be regulated, but government,' said Mr Chung
Mong Joon, a son of Mr Chung senior and one of the 32 UNP members in the
National Assembly.
Mr Chung's appeal reflects national pride. His rags to riches story
personifies South Korea's phenomenal growth in the post-war period. He has
successfully contrasted the rapid rise of Hyundai into the country's biggest
exporter with the government's patchy record on inflation and the trade
deficit. 'Many Koreans want to elect a strong leader who will give the
country a sense of purpose like President Park Chung Hee did with his
industrialisation programme 30 years ago. They see that figure in Chung Ju
Yung, who had good relation with Park,' said one Western diplomat.
The government's recent attempts to punish the Hyundai companies and the
Chung family for alleged financial violations has increased Mr Chung's
popularity since it casts him in the role of underdog vis-a-vis the
political establishment.
The purpose of the government's harassment campaign was to prevent Mr Chung
from using Hyundai's considerable financial and personnel resources in his
campaign. Some DLP members concede that action was a strategic error. 'We
should have tried to accommodate him instead of alienating him,' said one
party official.
That mistake may come back to haunt the DLP if Mr Chung siphons off enough
votes from the ruling party to deprive it of another term in the Blue House.
The UNP's voting strength in the National Assembly should make the DLP
worry. The UNP transcended political regionalism by doing well in all
sections of the country except for the south-western Cholla region, the
stronghold of the Democrats.
Mr Chung's fortunes could still dim if Koreans decide that they don't want
to see big business replace the military as their rulers. It is likely that
the other chaebol, fearful of the political influence that Hyundai could
have, will persuade their large workforces that it is not in their best
interests to vote for the UNP.
However, there is little doubt that Mr Kim Dae Jung would be pleased to see
Mr Chung continue to chip away at the DLP's strength. The Democrats also
benefited from discontent with the government in the National Assembly
elections. The party gained 29.2 per cent of the vote, with a strong showing
in Seoul in addition to its Cholla base, and increased its parliamentary
representation to 97 seats.
Mr Kim is doing his best to correct the erroneous impression, the result of
the former military government's propaganda, that he is a leftist. His
position papers are moderate in tone and he is unlikely to introduce radical
reforms if elected president.
The prospect of sitting in the Blue House is even encouraging him to mend
relations with the military, who kidnapped and nearly executed him in the
1970s. Although the prospect of a military coup if Mr Kim is elected has
probably diminished for good in the new democratic South Korea, he is taking
no chances by recruiting former generals into the Democratic Party.
Mr Kim Dae Jung faces the same problem as the other Mr Kim of being an old
face on the political stage. His wisest course would be sit back and hope
that the DLP and the UNP tear each other apart, leaving him to pick up the
spoils on election day.
Mr Kim should not rest too easily given the notorious fluidity of Korean
politics. Some analysts expect that Mr Chung, concerned about the possible
election of Mr Kim, may eventually withdraw from the race and give his
support to Mr Kim Young Sam in return for political favours.

FT  27 MAY 92 / Survey of Korea (1): Democracy takes root - Korea has much
to feel proud of but it also has ample cause for concern as the country's
success has bred new problems. Whoever succeeds President Roh next February
will have to face many stiff challenges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENSE of malaise pervades South Korea in the fifth and final year of
President Roh Tae Woo's Sixth Republic. That is surprising given the
considerable achievements of his administration.
Democracy has taken root and is flourishing. The influence of the military,
which dominated post-war politics, is declining and none of the presidential
candidates has a military background. Labour and student unrest is subsiding
as Koreans exercise their democratic powers  - most recently by almost
denying the government a parliamentary majority in the National Assembly
elections in March.
The economy is still one of the world's fastest expanding, with an expected
growth rate of at least 7 per cent this year following a 8.4 per cent gain
in 1991. Gross national product and per capita income nearly doubled in the
past five years.
South Korea is winning its own cold war with North Korea, which is suffering
growing economic problems as it becomes isolated in a non-communist world.
Tensions are gradually easing on the peninsula as the two sides take the
first steps toward eventual unification.
They signed treaties last December banning nuclear weapons and promoting
economic exchanges. Difficulties remain in implementing these pacts,
particularly procedures for nuclear inspections in North Korea which the US
government believes may soon have its own bomb. But there is optimism in
Seoul that closer co-operation between the two Koreas is not far off.
The reason why Koreans are worried, in spite of these favourable
developments, is that the country is breeding a new set of problems.
Rapid economic growth is fuelling inflation and raising wages, which is
eroding South Korea's international competitiveness. Policy decisions are
taking longer to reach as the strength of the democratic opposition
increases. The unification process threatens to place a heavy financial
burden on Seoul.
Whoever succeeds President Roh next February and inaugurates the Seventh
Republic will have to tackle these challenges as South Korea reaches a
historical turning point. This is the completion of the country's
transformation from a developing nation into a mature economy. But the
transition is provoking new questions and doubts about Korea's future.
The next stage in the country's development is less easy to predict with
confidence. Talk about Korea becoming the next Japan has become muted.
Instead, attention is focused on whether South Korea can maintain the
momentum that has made it the world's 15th largest economy. The answer will
largely depend on whether South Korea succeeds in restructuring its
industry.
The development of competitive advanced technologies and the establishment
of profitable businesses in areas where the country can enjoy a strong
competitive advantage are necessary to support its export-dependent economy.
The country must reduce its dependence on light manufacturing and heavy
industries, which prospered on cheap labour.
South Korean wages are no longer low and are the second highest in Asia
after Japan. This reflects the growth of organised labour following the
introduction of full democracy in 1987 and the strong negotiating power
workers have in an economy marked by labour shortages.
Korean companies have the breathing space to make the necessary adjustments
to their industrial structure. They are establishing factories in other
low-wage Asian countries, including China and Vietnam, to keep production
costs under control. Korea is targeting Asia to balance the loss of market
share by some sectors in the US and Europe. South-east Asia may soon surpass
the US as Korea's biggest export market.
South Korea's family-owned business groups, or chaebol, must be careful not
to allow their successful expansion in Asia to dissuade them from
undertaking the difficult task of reforming themselves.
The chaebol, which dominate the Korean economy, have been the main engines
behind the country's industrialisation since the 1960s and their growth was
fuelled by cheap government loans. But the government believes that they
have become too large and unwieldly, with their activities spread across a
wide range of industrial sectors. Credit restrictions have been imposed to
force the chaebol to specialise and improve their efficiency, but to little
avail. Although the chaebol complain about increased financing costs as a
result of the credit controls, they still borrow and invest too much in
unproductive areas, the government claims.
A change might be effected if family ownership of the chaebol is reduced.
Only about 30 per cent of the main chaebol subsidiaries are publicly listed
and the government wants more of them open to outside investment,
particularly from financial institutions such as banks. The government
argues that institutional ownership will lead to improved management as
family owners vacate top positions.
A more effective reform of the chaebol would be to reduce the barriers and
controls that still protect them from some competitive pressures. This would
include eliminating the remaining import barriers and, more importantly,
introducing full financial deregulation. An expected rise in interest rates
that would follow liberalisation would probably force the chaebol to dispose
of unproductive assets.
Allowing the chaebol unlimited access to foreign loans could also encourage
divestments. Foreign investors are cautious about lending to the chaebol
because they have high gearing ratios, a legacy from their days of easy
credit. Selling assets would lower the chaebol's debt burden and attract
international lenders.
However, the government is reluctant to give up its control over the economy
and, in particular, command of the financial system. The strong role of the
state in economic management has characterised South Korea's development.
Although government intervention proved effective in building up Korean
industry, it is producing harmful side effects as the economy matures. For
example, the government's powerful influence on the financial system has led
to distortions in credit allocation, hampering the development of
entrepreneurial small and medium businesses.
The government is committed in principle to financial liberalisation by
1997, but scepticism remains whether that deadline will be met. Deregulation
and liberalisation would mean the acceptance of greater foreign involvement
in the Korean economy. That is a large psychological hurdle for Koreans, who
distrust outside interference, to overcome.
The pace of economic liberalisation will be determined by the unification
process, which could produce contradictions in government policy. If South
Korea is forced to absorb North Korea in the next few years as a result of a
political upheaval similar to that which occurred in Germany in 1989, Seoul
will have to rely on foreign capital and industrial investments to help it
revive the north.
This is one factor that could accelerate liberalisation. But Korea will
become a more self-absorbed country as it tackles the immense task of
unification. The government may argue that economic controls are still
needed to co-ordinate state and corporate efforts in rebuilding North Korea.
South Korea's next president could confront perhaps the most tumultuous
period in the country's history since the Korean War if unification occurs
soon. Korea's great strength is the strong sense of national purpose that
emerges in times of crisis, but that sentiment could rest uneasily with
Korea's need to finish internationalising its economy even as it becomes
reunited.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Ian Davidson on Europe: The battles are not over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
In the immediate aftermath of the Maastricht summit last December, there was
a palpable sense of anti-climax. A great battle had been won, the new Treaty
of European Union was decided, and all excitement had evaporated.
Half a year on, this sense of anti-climax looks decidedly premature. Yes,
the Maastricht treaty sets out an extraordinarily ambitious programme for
the future development of European integration; but no, the battles are not
over, the last word has not been spoken, the European Community has not
reached a consensual resting place. The next phase in the never-ending
struggle is just about to begin.
This never-ending struggle is about the nature of the Community. This is not
mainly a battle between federalists and anti-federalists, but over the
competences of the Community. Is it an arrangement between free states for
the purpose of organising their market economy, with occasional political
forays as an optional after-thought? Or is it essentially a political
association, which just happened to start out with an economic agenda for
reasons of caution and commodity?
The Maastricht phase of this struggle pronounced a contradictory compromise.
Through Economic and Monetary Union (Emu), the Community will become
increasingly federal, and thus essentially political; but its overt
political agenda, of foreign and security policy, though rhetorically
ambitious, is imprisoned in inter-governmental procedures which will make
common action inherently difficult and infrequent.
This contradiction is too lame to last. If Emu reaches its term, the
participating states will have abandoned all pretension to the independent
macro-management of their economies. If a single European currency is
created, on a basis of monetary stability and budgetary restraint, it can
hardly fail to displace the dollar as the world's pivotal currency. Is there
anyone who seriously supposes that such a Community should remain hobbled
and impotent in the field of foreign and security policy?
Well, yes, there is such a person, and his name is Mr Malcolm Rifkind,
Britain's new defence minister. In a recent speech on Europe's security
policy, Mr Rifkind made clear that he does not hold with the idea. European
security is Nato, the whole of Nato, and nothing but Nato; the Europeans may
activate their long-dormant Western European Union (WEU) defence grouping if
they like, but only as an adjunct to Nato. In all circumstances, the
Europeans must first ask Nato; what Mr Rifkind means, of course, is that the
Europeans must first ask the Americans.
You think I exaggerate? Try this. 'The approach which the UK advocates is to
sustain the clear assignment of allies' forces to Nato, while at the same
time providing an ability to employ them for WEU purposes when that seems
necessary. A decision to do so would require prior consultation within Nato,
of course.' I just love 'of course'.
The problem for the nostalgics is that Nato's treaty tasks are increasingly
irrelevant to the security threats of the new world, and relevance is not
improved by dreaming up new peace-keeping tasks not provided for in the
treaty. Mr Rifkind implies that Nato (ie the US) should have a veto on
European military action outside the Nato area and outside the
responsibility of the Atlantic treaty. Yet he does not claim that Europe
should have a veto next time America wants to bomb Libya or land troops in
Lebanon. It is most curious.
The question whether Europe should have its own foreign and security policy
will not be decided by Nato, however, let alone by Mr Rifkind. But it may be
critically influenced by the Community's forthcoming debate over the
admission of new members. And the question will be answered by the relative
balance between those countries which want a foreign and security policy,
and those which do not.
Not surprisingly, it is those countries which used to have a national
foreign and security policy, which now want a foreign and security policy
for Europe; they tend to be the large countries. The small countries long
ago gave up any such thing for themselves, and are less interested in
creating it for Europe.
The present Community has five large countries, and seven small. Last week
President Francoise Mitterrand and Chancellor Helmut Kohl strongly endorsed
the membership applications of Austria, Sweden and Finland; presumably they
will also endorse that of Switzerland when it is formalised.
All these countries are small, and they are also, in different ways,
neutral. If they are admitted, the Community will still have only five large
member states; but out of 16 members, 11 will be small and five will be
neutral.
If this should be the future membership of the Community, there are only two
possibilities. The first is that it will never acquire a European foreign
and security policy, whatever the words in the Maastricht treaty. The second
is that those big countries which want a foreign and security policy will
have to form an inner political core or directory. In the end, even Britain
will prefer the second option.

FT  26 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Brazil slumps as South Africa peaks
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Performances by one of Latin America's leading emerging markets and a
resurgent South Africa were in stark contrast.
In SAO PAULO, Brazilian shares fell 7.4 per cent by midday, reacting to
growing scandal over a feud between President Fernando Collor de Mello and
his younger brother Pedro.
The key Bovespa index dropped 1,890 to 23,631 after President Collor
announced that he would sue on account of allegations made against him in a
magazine over the weekend.
Trading was moderate, though, with a total volume of only 164.4 bn
cruzeiros.
In South Africa, JOHANNESBURG's industrial index rose 31 to a new high of
4,635 on keen demand for blue chip stocks. Lifted by the gains in leading
shares, mainly industrials and mining financial Anglos, the overall index
rose 26 to 3,709 and the gold index was up 8 at 1,121.
Anglos led the mining financial sector with a gain of R2.50 to R121.50. De
Beers closed up 60 cents at R91.85.
TORONTO remained flat due to market holidays in the US and the UK. The TSE
300 index closed down 1.84 points at 3,370.31, according to preliminary
figures. Declines led advances 243 to 234 with a volume of 18.8 shares
valued at CDollars 142.4m.
Nine out of 14 stock groups closed lower.

BOMBARDIER, the Canadian aerospace and transit equipment group, posted a 28
per cent gain in net profit in the first quarter ended April 13 on a 43 per
cent jump in sales, writes Robert Gibbons in Montreal.
Earnings were CDollars 32.7m, or 21 cents a share, against CDollars 25.6m,
or 18 cents, a year earlier on sales of Dollars 938m against Dollars 658m.
The big sales gain stemmed from higher sales of business jets and inclusion
for most of the latest period of the De Havilland Canada and UTDC, an
equipment maker.

ASKO Deutsche Kaufhaus, the German retailer which expanded dramatically in
the 1980s, said it would concentrate on key business areas and cut debts
following the departure of Mr Helmut Wagner, supervisory board chief,
Reuters reports.
Mr Klaus Wiegandt, management board chairman, confirmed that Mr Wagner had
left Asko last Friday after more than 30 years with the company. A former
chief executive, Mr Wagner had been instrumental in building up Asko from a
regional stores group.
Mr Wiegandt made clear differences of opinion had emerged between Mr Wagner

Mr Bernard Arnault, chairman of LVMH, told shareholders yesterday a rise in
net profit in 1992 'should be possible'. He said the French luxury goods
group was facing challenging economic conditions in key markets, notably the
US, the UK and Japan.
*****
Mannesmann, the German engineering group, said group net profit dropped in
the first four months of this year from the same period in 1991, Reuters
reports from Dusseldorf. Mr Werner Dieter, management board chairman, said
orders in the period rose 34 per cent to DM10.9bn (Dollars 6.6bn).
*****
Klokner-Werke, the German machinery group, recorded a pre-tax operating
profit of DM50m (Dollars 31m) in the first half of the fiscal year ending

FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Montedison tumbles 70% to L168bn but
maintains payout

<TEXT>
MONTEDISON, the Italian chemical and agribusiness concern controlled by the
Ferruzzi family, reported consolidated net profits of L168bn in 1991, a drop
of 70 per cent drop on the previous year's L556bn, but proposed leaving its
annual dividend unchanged at L50, AP-DJ reports from Milan.
The group blamed the sharp drop in profits on the fact that 1990 earnings
had been boosted by the sale of its stake in Enimont, the former joint
venture with state energy group Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi.
Montedison said gross operating earnings rose 12 per cent to L1,828bn last
year from L1,631 in 1990.
The improvement in the group's operating results was entirely due to its
agroindustrial unit Eridania, which reported a gross operating margin of
L1,025bn, up 15 per cent from L891bn in 1990.
Operating results at Montecatini, the chemical division, slipped 2 per cent
to L875bn from L891bn. Better results at its pharmaceuticals, specialty
chemicals, specialty polymers and energy divisions were eroded by the
tighter margins in the polymers market, which suffered from sluggish demand
in the car, construction and electronics industry, Montedison said.
IFIL. the Italian holding company which specialises in the food and hotels
sectors and is controlled by the Agnelli family, raised net group profits by
42 per cent to L162.5bn last year, Haig Simonian reports from Milan.
Net earnings at parent company level climbed 10.8 per cent to L105.5bn,
prompting a L10 a share increase in the dividend to L130 for ordinary shares
and L150 for savings stock.
In an expansion of its hotel activities, IFIL said it now owned 2 per cent
of Accor, the French hotels chain, with which it already operates two joint
ventures in Italy. The holding had been bought for around L70bn through the
Paris bourse and with Accor management's approval.

FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ascom loses Swiss status under ownership
rules

   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASCOM, the Swiss telecommunications equipment group, has become one of the
first leading Swiss companies to lose its national status under the
country's law limiting property purchases by foreigners.
The problem is likely to become more widespread as Swiss companies actively
court foreign investors and remove restrictions on share ownership.
The so-called Lex Friedrich requires that companies be able to prove that
more than half of their capital is held by Swiss nationals. If they are not
able to do so, they must submit each attempted property purchase to review.
Ascom confronted this challenge several months ago when it tried to buy a
few square metres of land for a telecoms installation.
The government demanded proof that more than half of Ascom's capital was in
Swiss ownership, but the company was unable to provide it. In fact, the
directors suspect that a majority is held by foreigners.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Pentagon reshapes its strategy with greater emphasis on UN
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN, US Editor
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
COLLECTIVE security rather than the preservation of sole military superpower
status should be the principal goal of US defence policy for the remaining
years of this century, according to the Pentagon.
A revised draft of a controversial internal policy paper leaked in February
no longer states that the overriding US national security goal should be to
prevent the emergence of a rival to American military hegemony.
Instead, according to leaks to the New York Times and other publications of
the 1994-99 Defence Planning Guidance, a prime goal should be to 'strengthen
and extend the system of defence arrangements that binds democratic and like
minded nations together'.
While it does not preclude the formation of ad hoc coalitions, as in the
Gulf war last year, it places great emphasis on the value of United Nations
peacekeeping operations and regional security agreements such as Nato. The
first draft had warned against 'the emergence of European-only security
arrangements' among US allies.
The careful leaking of the revised document appears to mark the end of a
curious passage in the US defence policy debate this year and a victory of
sorts for the internationalist wing of the defence establishment over its
more unilateralist counterpart. It now awaits formal approval by President
Bush.
The original draft had drawn intense criticism at home and abroad. It had
been attacked domestically as an attempt by the Pentagon to justify
sustaining high levels of defence spending at a time when a a post-Cold War
diversion of resources to home use was widely considered politically and
socially necessary.
Overseas, the first draft was interpreted as a warning to allies such as
Japan and Germany not to challenge US military supremacy and to nations as
different as Russia and India to hold back on any plans to develop regional
military hegemony. Given the absence of any recent elaboration of Mr Bush's
concept of a 'new world order', its muscular tone appeared to imply little
fundamental change in US thinking in the wake of the collapse of the Soviet
threat.
The changes in the document were freely ascribed to the recent inputs of
Dick Cheney, the defence secretary, and General Colin Powell, chairman of
the joint chiefs of staff. Both drafts were written by Paul Wolfowitz, who
is close to both Mr Cheney and General Powell.
The shift in geopolitical emphasis and the adoption of more moderate
language in the second draft did not bring about any change in what the
Pentagon considers its minimum needs.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Italy's MPs elect compromise candidate as new president
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY'S two houses of parliament last night voted by a substantial majority
to elect Mr Oscar Luigi Scalfaro, Speaker of the Chamber of Deputies, as the
country's ninth president.
His election, ending lengthy political squabbling, took place against the
sombre background of the funeral in Palermo of Mr Giovanni Falcone, the
anti-Mafia magistrate assassinated at the weekend.
The 73-year-old Mr Scalfaro, a magistrate and veteran member of the
Christian Democrat Party, emerged as a compromise candidate after 15
abortive attempts to elect a new head of state.
His election was made possible by the backing of the former communists, the
Party of the Democratic Left (PDS). The PDS agreed to him after he was
proposed by the Christian Democrats as an 'institutional' candidate to
underline the need for thoroughgoing reform in Italy.
His first task will be to name a new government to replace the caretaker
cabinet of Mr Giulio Andreotti, who resigned on April 24 after inconclusive
general elections earlier in the month.
The broad party agreement behind Mr Scalfaro should enable the choice of a
new government well beyond the outgoing four-party coalition of Christian
Democrats, Socialists, Liberals and Social Democrats.
The new government is expected to have as its platform a reform of Italy's
proportional representational system, a review of the seven-year term and
role of the president, and introduction of tough austerity measures to
ensure Italy complies with the conditions of economic convergence laid down
in the Maastricht treaty on European union.
Mr Scalfaro polled 672 votes of the 1,002 votes cast in a joint session of
the Italian parliament - far more than the 508 votes he needed to get
elected. He replaces Mr Francesco Cossiga, who resigned on April 28.
The tortuous voting process began on May 13, when it was marred by a scuffle
between rival parliamentarians.
It would have been difficult for the 16 parties in parliament to continue
horse-trading much longer over the presidency in view of the public mood
since the Palermo magistrate's assassination.
The public outcry at the murder has been directed as much against
politicians as against the Mafia.
Mr Falcone was blown up on Saturday evening along with his wife and three
bodyguards when about a tonne of explosives was detonated under their
three-car convoy near Palermo airport.
At his funeral, government members were jeered and jostled as Sicilians
vented their anger at the vacuum of authority and the inability to protect
Mr Falcone, who was known to be at the top of the Mafia's hit list.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Northern city of steel shows signs of rust: Sheffield's
financial difficulties mean the council must make hefty budget savings, axe
jobs and cut services
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir Robert Scholey hails from Sheffield, along with the steel industry to
which he has dedicated his working life. He recently returned to the city of
his birth and was saddened by what he saw.
Outside the Victorian gothic town hall in Pinstone Street, the chairman of
British Steel frowned at the neglected flower beds and the dribbling,
dilapidated fountain.
Sir Robert returned to London and wrote a letter to the Sheffield Star,
reprimanding the city fathers for an evident loss of civic pride.
The front page of the edition in which it appeared carried a banner headline
demanding that the city's ruling Labour group 'come clean' about the
financial crisis which it said the council had created.
'Empty flower beds are a tiny hint of what is to come. For years, we've
accused the council of hiding from reality and now they've come horribly
unstuck,' according to Mr David Heslop, leader of the council's Tory group.
Outnumbered six-to-one on the Labour benches, Mr Heslop's team may have all
the impact of a gnat's bite on an elephant's backside. But it is no longer
alone.
The city treasurer, Mr Malcolm Newman, has warned the council about living
beyond its means. Councillors have also received a letter from Mr Gordon
Sutton, the district auditor, referring to the threat of serious fiscal
problems ahead.
Mr John Hambidge, chief executive of Sheffield's chamber of commerce, says
the council has chosen to ignore the warning signs for years but that the
'day of reckoning has arrived'. Mr Irvine Patnick, the only Conservative MP
in Sheffield, says the authority 'is on the edge of a precipice, hanging on
by one finger'.
Despite an increase in the poll tax from Pounds 217 last year to Pounds 281
in 1992-93, the people of Sheffield now face a summer and autumn of
announcements which will gradually expose the extent of the city's
difficulties. In the short-term, the council has to find savings of about
Pounds 10m in the current year's Pounds 400m budget. The city treasurer has
talked of cuts reaching Pounds 50m next year.
There are rumours of possible large-scale redundancies from the workforce -
numbering 26,000 - of the council which is the largest local employer. The
city has in the past put job protection on an equal footing with the
provision of services but now Mr Mike Bower, the newly elected Labour
leader, acknowledges: 'Perhaps the balance was wrong. We can no longer
afford to employ people in all the jobs we need them to do.' Other possible
action includes rises in council rents, cuts in education budgets and
closure of old peoples' homes.
The city was once the proud model of Labour local government when Mr David
Blunkett, now the party's local government spokesman, was its leader. Now it
stands accused of indulging in a costly binge, running down reserves and of
turning creative accounting into an art form while wilfully defying the
constraining influence of central government. Most recently, it was charged
with gambling on a Labour central government riding to its rescue after the
general election with desperately needed extra cash.
Ironically, the city played host to Labour's now notorious election campaign
rally which is said to have sown the seeds of Labour's defeat.
Despite warnings from the party's national leadership that the city could
not expect a blank cheque, the council counted on better times under a more
generous regime. There were high hopes of an immediate release for use of
Pounds 23m of capital receipts from council house sales and an end to any
threat of capped budgets.
The council's elected leaders vehemently deny the allegations against it,
although they accept they face a series of painful decisions in the
short-term as well as a fundamental rethink about the future. One likely
result is a redefining of the council's role and a shrinkage of its
traditional civic responsibilities.
The significance of Sheffield's dilemma, beyond the immediate impact on its
own state of health, is that many other authorities may be forced to follow
as the Conservatives continue to erode local government powers.
The city's problems go back at least to 1985, when the council was
rate-capped and it sought to sustain its spending programmes by turning to
Banque Paribas to syndicate a Pounds 90m loan that will have to be repaid
into the next century.
Its difficulties were compounded by the decision to seek to boost its
international status by staging last summer's world student games - an event
no city outside the UK wanted. The games entailed capital expenditure of
nearly Pounds 150m and left in their wake, alongside some spectacular
sporting facilities, an operating loss of Pounds 10.5m. The city now faces
an inquiry into the losses by the district auditor.
Mr Bower denies the city is on its knees but accepts that morale is low
after Labour's national defeat: 'The perception is that we are barmy and
waste money. The truth is that we have been fighting against unfair
treatment by central government for years to provide badly needed services.'
'We cannot see any prospect of outside help and we will have to take apart,
penny by penny, Pounds 700m of gross expenditure and start again.'
He argues a case repeatedly made by aggrieved councils: that Sheffield's
problems stem primarily from years of underfunding by a hostile Whitehall.
In the past four years, he says, reductions in government grant to the city
have cost it more than Pounds 120m, while comparable cities facing similar
problems have done better.
Mr Bower wins support for his accusation of underfunding from Mrs Pamela
Gordon, the city's chief executive. She says big budget cuts look inevitable
and points out that government grant per adult is 11 per cent below the
national average for metropolitan districts. Sheffield, she adds, is 28th in
the league of 36 districts when it comes to the allocation of government
funds.
The council, meanwhile, has to get on with the cost-savings. Mr Bower says
he expects a significant part of council services to be maintained, while
some will be scaled down and others abandoned completely. He hopes
compulsory redundancies can be avoided. In spelling out possible solutions,
he cites an Italian council which contracts out social services to local
co-operatives and German authorities which hand over day care for children
to the churches.
Mr Bower says he has a stand-by plan in his back-pocket: 'If we cut the
working week from 37 hours to 35, but pay people for working 36, the
workforce gets two more leisure hours but only loses one hour's pay. We save
Pounds 10.5m and although everyone suffers a little, nobody suffers a lot.'
The idea of paying people for one hour's work which they are not expected to
do does not give the Tory group many grounds for believing that Labour in
Sheffield is about to change. According to Mr Heslop: 'It's typical of the
crisis management in which this council has excelled. If Councillor Bower
has any sense, he will keep the silly idea deep in his back pocket.'

FT  26 MAY 92 / Cauldron in the Caucasus: The wider ramifications of the
Armenian-Azerbaijani conflict
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN LLOYD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Last Saturday, a couple of young Armenian soldiers stood outside a mosque in
Shusha, a town in Nagorno Karabakh just captured from Azerbaijani forces.
One of the soldiers raised his Kalashnikov, and began firing at the crescent
on top of a minaret. He missed. His comrade tried and missed too. Laughing,
they gave up.
The Armenian church above the mosque, part restored, is now a shrine.
Outside, boxes containing rockets were piled up high; the church had been an
Azeri arsenal, and had just been cleared by the victorious Armenians.
The conflict in the Transcaucasus, in particular that between the republics
of Armenia and Azerbaijan, is not explicitly religious. It is about
territory. But the conflict is now increasingly legitimised by being set, by
the combatants, in a religious and racial setting. The Christians
(Armenians) against the Moslems (Azerbaijanis). The dishonouring of each
other's religious shrines is a matter of pride.
Thus the conflict, inevitably, draws into its vortex the surrounding states
 -Russia, Iran, Turkey and Georgia on the borders; the Moslem Central Asian
states of the former Soviet Union; even states further off, such as Ukraine
to the west and Pakistan to the south. Plus, of course, those countries with
large communities of the Armenian diaspora, such as France, the US, Syria
and Lebanon.
Of these Turkey has emerged as the leading player. Turkey shares a border
with Armenia and - for only 12km on its south-east wing - the Nakhichevan
region of Azerbaijan. Istanbul has accused Armenia of aggression against
Nakhichevan and Mr Turgut Ozal, Turkey's president, even threatened - from
his hospital bed in Houston, Texas - to send in the Turkish army.
This threat brought a sharp reaction from Russia, which sent a delegation
headed by Mr Genady Burbulis, President Boris Yeltsin's chief aide, to the
Armenian capital of Yerevan last Thursday to pointedly begin talks on the
continued stationing in Armenia of the Seventh Army, now under Russian
control. A week previously Armenia had signed a mutual security pact with
Russia and four other former Soviet republics. Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov,
head of the armed forces of the Commonwealth of Independent States (CIS),
warned of war between Turkey - a Nato member - and the CIS. Suddenly, the
obscure little Armenian-Azeri war had become very important.
Following the Soviet collapse, the countries around the ex-superpower's
borders have sought to increase their influence on its former republics.
None more so than Turkey. Its diplomats and traders have been especially
active in Azerbaijan (the Azeris and the Turks are ethnic kin), and in the
Moslem Central Asian states, which have been offered Turkish aid.
Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkey's foreign minister, currently in Mosocw with his
premier Mr Suleyman Demirel for talks with Russian leaders, proposed last
week the convention of a regional initiative to solve the Armenian-Azeri
dispute - an apparent bid for regional hegemony.
Ukraine, increasingly of the opinion that anyone who challenges Russia
should be treated as a friend, sees Turkey as an ally in its struggle with
Russia over possession of the Crimea (till the mid-19th century part of the
Ottoman empire). Ukraine is willing to resettle the (Moslem) Tatars back in
their Crimean homeland; Turkey, with an influential Tatar minority, is
supportive.
Throughout what were the Moslem areas of the former Soviet Union, parties
speaking in the name of Islam are growing in strength. Last month, Moslem
militants making common cause with a democratic movement forced the
Tajikistan government to form an uneasy coalition with their
representatives. Two of the autonomous republics within Russia itself -
Tatarstan and Chechen Ingushetia - have Moslem-oriented governments.
The more Armenian militants present their conflict with Azeris as one
between Christian and Moslem civilisations - as they increasingly do - the
more this provokes a hardening response from Moslem nationalist-religious
forces. The Caucasian conflict has the power to send shock waves through the
crumbling fabric of the former Soviet Union, and far beyond.
At the epicentre is Nagorno Karabakh, the beautiful little mountain enclave
which contains no more than 150,000 people, the bulk of whom are Armenian.
In the Soviet period, Karabakh's status was that of an autonomous region
within Azerbaijan, a fact which has always been deeply resented by
Armenians. In 1988, a group called the 'Karabakh Committee' started
agitating in Yerevan for the return of Karabakh to Armenian control. Today,
the Karabakh Committee forms the leadership in the Armenian state.
Since 1988, as Moscow's control weakened, the Armenian-Azeri issue has
slipped beyond compromise. In 1988-89, there were massacres of Armenians in
the Azeri cities of Sumgait and Baku; Armenians living in Azerbaijan
streamed into Armenia (and into Karabakh) from Azerbaijan, while Azeris fled
revenge in Armenia. The Soviet army occupied Karabakh in 1990 and tried to
impose calm. When it began a pull-out early this year, hostilities became
open.
In March, the government of Mr Ayaz Mutalibov, the communist president of
Azerbaijan, fell. The Armenians immediately went on the offensive. They
expelled most of the remaining Azeris from eastern Karabakh - leaving Azeri
forces controlling only one centre, Shusha, a few kilometres from the
enclave's present capital, Stepanakaert. From Shusha, the Azeri garrison
kept up a bombardment against Stepanakaert.
Many of the buildings in the central area of Stepanakaert have been either
destroyed or damaged. The town's inhabitants have lived in cellars for
months; their ration of food is down to a kilogramme of flour a month -
supplemented with what they can get from the barely functioning markets.
There is no electricity, no gas, no running water. In the central hospital,
Dr Mesrop Makaryan said medical care could only deal with the wounded. Other
illnesses are unattended.
Faced with such an onslaught, the Karabakh Praesidium decided on May 7 that
the only defence was attack, according to Mr Levon Melik-Shakhnazarian, the
head of the committee on foreign affairs in the Karabakh Supreme Soviet and
a member of the 11-strong Praesidium.
After making a feint at the Azeri-held position of Janhassan behind
Stepanakaert (which succeeded in diverting Azeri forces), the Armenians
launched their main - and successful - assault on Shusha. Today, Shusha, now
even more destroyed than Stepanakaert, is held by Armenian soldiers - and
Armenians are returning to the Armenian quarter in the town.
The capture of Shusha has made possible the realisation of a long-held
Armenian aim - the opening of a corridor from Armenia to Karabakh across the
narrowest part of Azerbaijan, separating the two by only a few kilometres.
Shusha, while under Azeri control, had once commanded this road; now it is
in Armenian hands. On May 17, Armenian forces from Karabakh and Armenia
launched attacks on the town of Lachin on the western Azerbaijan-Karabakh
border. The town, in a valley, was an easy target.
At the weekend, a few days after the battle for Shusa, the town was again
being looted and burned by the Armenians. Lorries, vans, private cards and
oil tankers roared up the narrow mountain road, hauling back the spoils of
war to Armenia. In the town centre, Karabakhers piled provisions from the
shops onto carts to take back to Stepanakaert. A body so burned as to be
recognisable only by a hand lay pounded into the garbage on the road. Dead
farm animals lay decomposed at the entrances to flaming (Azeri) homes, the
unlooted possessions strewn about.
None of the Armenians spoken to believe the corridor is secure. Mr Oleg
Yesoyan, the Karabakh prime minister, said: 'I hope other nations will
understand our need for the corridor - without it we lose our land.'
After the corridor was established, a new front was opened up on the borders
of Nakhichevan. This strip of land, nestling against the Iranian and Turkish
borders, is part of Azerbaijan - though separated from it by Armenian
territory. It is a matter of dispute who began hostilities on the borders of
Nakhichevan; but it is probably academic now, for last week the Armenians
were shelling the town of Sadarak just inside the Nakhichevan border and the
Azeris were returning fire, hitting Armenian villages.
In Sadarak, Mr Halil Gajiev said his two grandchildren had been killed by a
rocket. On the Armenian side, in the village of Sevakavan, the family of
Knyazyan live in the dirty basement of their house, itself holed by a shell.
This theatre seems to have won a respite. Mr Gaidar Aliev, the Nakhichevan
president, has agreed with Armenia's President Levon Ter-Petrosian to the
creation of a security zone along the border. Indeed, at the end of last
week, Mr Aliev was on the phone to Mr Ter-Petrosian begging for a ceasefire.
For this Mr Aliev has been criticised by the new government in Baku. And in
this criticism is a clue to the depth of the dispute. For in Baku, the
Popular Front which now governs is an exact counterpart to the Karabakh
Committee ruling in Armenia. In short, it is the militants who now command
in Baku and Yerevan.
Real peace is unlikely. Overtures from the Conference for Security and
Co-operation in Europe, and from the UN, to mediate between the mutually
contradictory responses from Karabakh (backed by Armenia) that it be
accorded the independent statehood it seeks, and from Azerbaijan that
Karabakh be treated as an integral part of the republic of Azerbaijan, seem
unlikely to yield fruit.
Mr Demirel, the Turkish premier, will today report on his two days of talks
with the Russian leaders, which last night culminated in the signing of a
new treaty of co-operation between the two states. It is a safe bet that he
will seek to blur the recent outbreak of enmity which sprang up like a
flame. But his sphere of influence is expanding. His interlocutors in Moscow
are struggling to contain the shrinking of their own formerly undisputed
suzerainty of the region. The collapse of the Russian empire has so far had
 -in the historical scale - few casualties. But its consequences are only
just beginning, and the ethnic and religious cauldron of the Caucasus is an
early and frightening test.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Personal View: Why Rio must deliver
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CARLO RIPA DI MEANA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
World leaders meeting next week in Rio to discuss the environment and
development must come up with concrete solutions to the problems which beset
the planet. If Rio is simply a breast-beating session or a stage on which
politicians may strut, it is doomed to failure and our planet with it.
The context in which the conference takes place is not promising. The
developing countries are suspicious of the motives of the developed world.
They claim, rightly in my view, that the richer countries will have to put
their money where their mouthes are if the poorer countries are to sacrifice
their short-term vision of development in favour of more sustainable
solutions. Add to that the appalling problems faced by eastern and central
Europe and you have a potentially explosive mixture.
What are the prospects for success? At the last preparatory meeting in New
York, agreement was reached on the 27 principles of the proposed Rio
Declaration on Environment and Development. More than three-quarters of the
Action Programme called Agenda 21 was also decided upon, including the
crucial chapter on the institutional follow-up to the conference. On the
negative side, however, the preparatory conference was unable to resolve the
finance, technology co-operation, forestry, atmosphere, bio-diversity and
bio-technology chapters of Agenda 21.
The forestry principles, which the European Community believes should serve
as the basis for the negotiation of a legally binding forestry convention
after Rio, are still a long way from completion. And omens for the
bio-diversity convention are not encouraging while talks on the climate
change convention also give cause for concern.
The EC supported and will continue to support the establishment at a global
level of clear targets for stabilising carbon dioxide emissions, along the
lines of the year 2000 target as agreed by the Council in October 1990. We
cannot afford to compromise on this. The intransigent position adopted by
some countries has resulted in a vague draft convention with many exceptions
which verges on the void.
It is hard to avoid the conclusion that, in some cases, the welfare and
perhaps the survival of the planet is being sacrificed to short-term
electoral or economic gain. The present weak draft was precipitately
accepted by the eco-diplomats of the participating states, perhaps in the
hope of a trade-off in another forum, such as the Gatt. In any case, the Rio
conference should sound the death-knell for eco-diplomacy as it has been
practised up until now. The European Commission will continue to press for a
more ambitious and binding convention. The run-up to Rio must be used to
strengthen the text.
A last effort by the 12 EC member states and by the European institutions
should be launched, notably in two key areas of finance and climate change.
In finance, the world is looking to the EC to break the deadlock on
increased funding to promote the transition to sustainable development in
the Third World. Member states now need to put their money on the table, in
particular by setting a date for reaching the 1970 UN target of 0.7 per cent
of gross national product for official development assistance. The
Commission has been urging member states to agree a EC-wide commitment to
attain the 0.7 per cent target by 2000, but some governments refuse to set a
clear date. Without this, the EC's commitment to partnership with developing
countries will look hollow.
So far, the Community's strong negotiating stance in the climate convention
negotiations has been intimately linked to its high-profile interest in the
use of economic mechanisms, such as a carbon tax, to achieve the necessary
changes in production and consumption patterns. There is a firm decision on
the Commission's part to introduce a Community carbon/energy tax. The
proposal represents a revolutionary departure for our environmental policy
since, for the first time on such a supranational scale, a system of prices
and market mechanism is to be used for the defence of the environment.
Criticism has been voiced, by the European Parliament in particular, of the
conditionality of the tax. The conditionality proposed by the Commission
represents, at this stage, an efficient way, on the eve of Rio, of drawing
the attention of all other states to their responsibilities.
Rio is not the end of the race but a timid passage of a new process. Its
content, with its reticence and silence, notably on population growth, is
not commensurate with the size and the gravity of the problems. The EC has
to a large extent already gone beyond the solutions of Rio. We must now open
new talks to arrive at additional protocols which will put flesh onto the
bare bones of the climate convention. These protocols will thus result in
concrete decisions with binding obligations to achieve precise targets. The
Commission will not spare its efforts to achieve that.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Leading Article: A cry of foul
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S independent terrestrial television companies are due in the High
Court today to challenge a Pounds 304m deal struck last week between
football's new Premier League and ITV's rivals, BSkyB and the BBC.
This fact alone hardly merits comment; if ITV can demonstrate a breach of
contractual procedure in the football deal, it is within its rights to seek
to re-open the negotiations. But the roar of hyperbole from the ITV crowd
which has accompanied the legal manoeuvre suggests a wider purpose.
ITV executives have made three main points: that football as a sport and a
business will be harmed by live coverage passing to a minority satellite
broadcaster; that the BBC is unwisely collaborating with its long term
enemy; and that consumers will lose by having to pay a satellite company
next year for what they have had 'free' on ITV this year.
The partisan illogic of these arguments would make a football commentator
blush. ITV may be a good judge of its own interest, but is unlikely to be so
for the BBC or for football. Nor can anything on a TV network funded by
advertising be considered free to consumers.
The doublethink in the ITV position is further exposed by the fact that some
of those involved now want ITV to collaborate in a partially pay-per-view
approach, possibly with a custom-made satellite football channel, in order
to raise the ITV bid.
These are all matters appropriately settled by raw commercial bargaining.
Britain's broadcasting act requires that a few big national events be
screened only on mass access channels; no one can reasonably argue that such
a public interest applies to every kick of the ball in the Premier League.
The new football deal is a good thing. It shows that Britain's more
deregulated broadcasting environment can generate enterprising if risky new
alliances and potentially more choice - football on a general channel free
at the point of watching represents choice denied to those who have paid but
do not wish to watch. Broadcasting is now a more competitive game; when you
lose, it's no good blaming the other team.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Time for a Gatt deal
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN IGNAZ Kiechle, Bonn's combative farm minister, describes leading farm
lobbyists as 'day dreamers who have no idea of agricultural political
necessities', revolutionary times have come. The reform of the Common
Agricultural Policy agreed last week may be a small revolution but it is a
revolution none the less. The CAP will never be the same again. Can the Gatt
be far behind?
The political necessity of which Mr Kiechle talks is not just the need to
cut the cost of farm subsidies, but to prevent a failure to settle the
Uruguay Round of multilateral trade negotiations. Another, more specifically
German, necessity is to ensure that continued failure will not poison the
summit of the G7 leading industrial countries in July, which is to be hosted
in Munich by Chancellor Helmut Kohl.
It cannot be assumed that last week's agreement over farm price reform in
the EC will lead to settlement of the Uruguay Round. But big obstacles have
at least been cleared. The decision to cut cereal prices by 29 per cent over
three years, for example, means a much larger proportionate cut in EC
domestic support for production. The demand in the draft Uruguay Round
agreement for a 20 per cent cut can be met with ease.
Lower cereal prices should lead to reduced production and higher
consumption. Once stocks have been used up, this ought to result in a
significantly lower quantity of subsidised exports and, with lower domestic
intervention prices, a still greater decline in the value of subsidies to
exports. Again the Uruguay Round requirement for a 36 per cent cut in the
value of subsidised exports, and a 24 per cent cut in volume, ought to be
achieved with some comfort.
Differences remain
This does not mean that all reasons for dispute have disappeared.
Differences remain over whether the EC's proposed compensation payments to
farmers distort production. But this need not prove a great difficulty. Any
output due to the compensation is likely to be negligible, certainly by
comparison with the US government's deficiency payments, which clearly
encourage production. If the result of the negotiation were to leave these
compensation payments unchallenged for several years, that should be
acceptable to all sides: to the EC, because it should not wish to pay
compensation forever for lowering what were outrageously high prices; to
lower cost producers, because it would allow EC reform to be banked now and
reconsidered subsequently.
Intractable issue
That leaves one hitherto intractable issue: the EC's demand for
'rebalancing', effectively a demand that US exports of cereal substitutes to
the EC be limited. The US has on principle refused to bow to this EC demand
to alter already agreed terms of market access. There is no principled
reason why its negotiators should change their stand. Nor should they, since
lower EC cereal prices will themselves limit imports of US cereal
substitutes.
What is needed now is swift agreement between the EC and US, with the former
abandoning the demand for 'rebalancing' and the latter accepting the EC's
compensation payments for a predetermined period of years. The presence of
EC negotiators in Washington this week gives both sides the needed
opportunity. The participation of Mr James Baker, US Secretary of State,
will add the necessary clout.
However imperfect the agreement that can now be reached, it would at least
provide more agricultural liberalisation than many could have reasonably
hoped back in 1986, when the Uruguay Round started. Having reached the
needed deal, the US and EC should turn their attention elsewhere: to other
countries that must make significant offers on agriculture, Japan, first and
foremost; and to the other outstanding obstacles, particularly market access
and services.
EC reform of the CAP has provided the basis for a final agreement in the
Uruguay Round. The US should settle on that basis, recognising that the EC
now has almost no room for manoeuvre. Although imperfect, the resulting
outcome can deliver what the world most needs: a major trade liberalisation;
a strengthened Gatt; and, not least, internationally agreed limits on the
world's agricultural policy fiasco.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Arts: Development of the City office block - Architecture
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By COLIN AMERY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The City of London is really an office block that covers one square mile.
This fact is rather skilfully, if unintentionally, brought out in an
exhibition at the Royal Exchange at the heart of the City called City
Changes. The sub-title of the show is Architecture in the City of London
1985 - 1995. The show is organised by the City Corporation and the
Architecture Foundation and should be compulsory viewing for anyone
interested in the future of London architecture and planning.
There is a certain agreeable irony in the fact that this show is being
housed in some of the freely available empty office space in the City -
especially as the hidden agenda of the show seems to be a promotion of the
City as a financial centre for a unified European Community. As Michael
Cassidy, the chairman of the Policy and Resources Committee of the City of
London, writes in his contribution to the catalogue about the over supply of
offices in the City: 'optimistically this now leaves the City with some of
the highest quality office buildings in the world available at a price that
would tempt new occupiers.' It is a very necessary sales pitch because, if
you take the period from 1986 and extend it to the end of 1993, 'the
equivalent of one half of the entire stock of office buildings in and around
the City will have been rebuilt or created.' I quote from the exhibition's
press release.
There are currently some 12.6 million square feet of vacant offices in the
City alone, not to mention the vacant 40 per cent of Canary Wharf that is
available to anyone willing to risk the journey downstream. In Docklands
since 1983, of the 9.7 million square feet of offices that has been
constructed, some 5.2 million square feet is vacant. There are some 68
proposed office developments in the pipeline amounting to a further 16
million square feet - although whether Docklands can take any more
development must seem very unlikely. The whole question of the planning
relationship between the City and Docklands is not even glanced at by this
exhibition.
It seems to me that the exhibition has two purposes, clearly expressed by
its design and layout. One is to hype the City as a an ever changing and
expanding place and to advance its cause as the potential home for the
European Central Bank. The other is to show some of the better architecture
that has been built, or is on the drawing board.
The first purpose is served by a large illuminated model of the whole City
that has subtly toned buildings to show what has been built in three
periods; pre-1945, 1945-1980, and since 1980. The model is shown so that you
have to look down on it like a bird - it has a rather old fashioned air; now
that computer models and videos are available I wondered about the real
value of this huge wooden object. It does show clearly where the most recent
growth has been and at a glance where high buildings have been permitted; it
would have been more interesting if it had been shown in relation to the
rest of London, particularly Docklands.
As an architectural exhibition it is really about the development of the
office block. As a building type that has changed radically since the late
1950's it is well worth examination. It is a difficult building type to
examine in purely architectural terms, because what we are really looking at
is a built equation that has to balance technological efficiency with
commercial and development values. How do you measure architectural success
in the light of the balancing act that both the architect and the developer
are performing? How do you measure the success of a city without taking into
account place making, the mixture of uses and the qualities of the public
realm ?
It is a fact that the great property boom of the 1980's did not produce much
good architecture. The 20 schemes shown in this exhibition, with good models
and drawings, are all of some interest, but they are only the tip of the
development iceberg. The best total development in the City has undoubtedly
been Broadgate - and I think that is not just because of the good standard
of its architecture, but also because the developers had the opportunity and
seized it to make a place with some life and quality. It may die at night
because no one lives there but, seen in combination with the highly
successful Liverpool Street Station redevelopment, it has genuinely enhanced
the life of the City. It has created new squares and added some good
sculpture to the scene - and it is traffic free.
The proposals for individual new buildings by famous architects like Sir
Norman Foster, Sir Richard Rogers and Peter Foggo in the redeveloping London
Wall area may not add as much because they are not part of any serious
master plan for a complete area.
There is some good and a lot of bad new architecture in the City. It seems
to me that the City's weakness is planning. Why is there no comprehensive
plan for the area around St. Paul's cathedral? How did the dog's dinner
around the Tower of London ever happen? Who is responsible for the traffic
madness that is Lower Thames Street? How did that dreadful new building at
the bottom of Ludgate Hill on the south side happen to have been just placed
to ruin the famous view of St. Paul's? How was the new Alban Gate building
on London Wall allowed to rise so high that it damages the view of St Paul's
from Blackfriars Bridge? You will not find the answers provided by the
architects selected by the Architecture Foundation for this exhibition.
Nice new offices do not make a city: with no sensible strategic planning for
London as a whole, even the value of the good things in the City will be
lost.
The exhibition at the Royal Exchange and can only be reached by lift via the
back entrance. It runs until August 21, and is free. Open 10 - 5.30 Mondays
to Saturdays.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Universities seek big state funds rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNIVERSITY CHIEFS have told the government that direct state funding for
universities needs to rise by more than a fifth - Pounds 400m - next year if
the quality of teaching and research is to be maintained as student numbers
rise.
In a submission to Mr John Patten, education secretary, for the 1993-94
public expenditure round, the committee of vice-chancellors and principals
points to the 9 per cent increase in university student numbers this year
and projections of a similar increase next year. The committee is seeking an
extra Pounds 450m in funding and believes universities can raise only Pounds
56m of it themselves.
The largest item - Pounds 165m - is to fund a salary increase in real terms
for existing academic staff 'to provide incentives for the radical and rapid
changes in teaching methods and course design now needed'.
The submission also includes Pounds 39m for new staff, Pounds 73m to improve
the pay of non-academic staff and Pounds 150m - almost double the existing
capital allocation to the Universities Funding Council - for 'essential'
improvements to plant and facilities.
The committee says: 'The key issue for universities in the 1990s is how to
achieve further expansion in line with their own and government's plans
without jeopardising the quality of their teaching and research.'
It expresses particular concern about academic pay levels, which have fallen
far behind the non-manual average in the past decade. The vice-chancellors
urge the establishment of a pay review body for higher education similar to
that accorded to school teachers, whose salary increases have far
outstripped those for academics in the past two years.
'As the government brings other comparable groups into the scope of pay
review bodies, it becomes progressively more difficult to explain to
university staff why they should be excluded,' the vice-chancellors say.
However, universities are unlikely to fare well in a tight public spending
round because schools are the government's priority for education spending.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Howard to consult widely on water
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONSERVATIONISTS and industry are to be consulted in a review by Mr Michael
Howard, environment secretary, of water resources and their use, writes
Alison Smith.
The review's origins lie in longer-term concerns expressed by - among others
 -the National Rivers Authority, the statutory body which has a duty to
monitor water resources. The authority and the water companies say
consumption has gone up because of a rise in the population and the
increased use of appliances such as dishwashers.
The review will cover conservation, distribution and charging methods. A new
form of charging must be devised before water rates are abolished at the end
of the decade.
Metering, which is favoured by industry watchdog Ofwat, would encourage
conservation but ministers are conscious that it could penalise large
families.
Mrs Ann Taylor, Labour's environment spokesman, said the review was welcome,
though belated, but warned that metering was not a straightforward solution.

FT  26 MAY 92 / MPs press Bank chief over Maxwell pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE all-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners
is likely to seek a meeting with Mr Robin Leigh-Pemberton, governor of the
Bank of England, when it meets next week.
The prospect of further pressure on the Bank comes as the government faces
renewed calls to compensate thousands of elderly pensioners who belong to
collapsed pension schemes of the late Mr Robert Maxwell's companies.
The 100-plus MPs are unhappy about the Bank's apparently relaxed view of its
supervisory role and believe that recent comments by Mr Leigh-Pemberton have
been unhelpful. These complaints were raised last week by Mr Richard Page
and Mr Frank Field, representing the group, with Mr Peter Lilley, social
security secretary, who 'willingly' undertook to pass them on to the Bank.
The group has no powers to compel attendance, as cross-party select
committees do, but the large number of MPs, including at least one minister,
who are taking an active interest in the issue mean that Mr Leigh-Pemberton
would come under considerable pressure to explain the Bank's approach to the
group.
Ministers are said to be pressing the pension-fund industry to devise a
scheme which could compensate the Maxwell pensioners.
Some of the MPs campaigning on behalf of the pensioners also believe that an
industry scheme offers the best way forward.
The government is unwilling to bear the cost of replacing the Pounds 400m
said to be missing from the Maxwell schemes, fearing that it could set a
precedent. Ministers have repeatedly ruled out the idea of a government
compensation scheme.
However, campaigners have been encouraged by what they believe is a more
positive approach from the government, which may be more sympathetic because
of a report from the Securities and Investments Board to be published soon.
The report may point to failings by Imro, the regulatory body for the
fund-management industry, in supervising and authorising Bishopsgate
Investment Management, which managed assets of all the Maxwell companies'
pension schemes. The pensioners believe that they are entitled to government
compensation because, they say, government departments mishandled the
supervision of Bishopsgate.
The National Association of Pension Funds is considering an industry-funded
scheme but opinion is divided. Mr Brian McMahon, association chairman, said
that letters to him show little support for a compensation scheme.

FT  26 MAY 92 / MoD denies being forced to remove Ulster brigadier
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE MINISTRY of Defence insisted yesterday that the removal of a senior Army
commander in Northern Ireland was 'an unfortunate coincidence' unconnected
with the recent controversy over the actions of paratroopers in County
Tyrone.
The decision to relieve Brigadier Tom Longland of his duties as commander of
the Armagh-based 3 Brigade was taken before the incidents earlier this month
in Coalisland, the MoD said. The brigadier, who had completed only five
months of his two-year posting, was replaced last Wednesday.
Mr Malcolm Rifkind, defence secretary, told BBC Radio's Today programme: 'I
am quite clear in my own mind that the incidents which took place in
Coalisland were not relevant to that particular decision.'
In spite of Mr Rifkind's words, Northern Ireland politicians were united in
seeing a connection between the brigadier's departure and the incidents. It
is likely to be raised in today's plenary session of the talks that resumed
earlier this month between Northern Ireland party leaders on the political
future of the province.
Mr Seamus Mallon, deputy leader of the nationalist Social Democratic and
Labour party, said he suspected the brigadier had come into conflict with
the police over their primary role in maintaining security. Mr David
Trimble, Ulster Unionist MP for Upper Bann, said it was unfortunate that the
brigadier's removal would be seen as a result of pressure from the Irish
government.
The Army is awaiting the outcome of police investigations into the two
Coalisland incidents, in which members of the 3rd Battalion, the Parachute
Regiment, allegedly rampaged through bars and, in a subsequent clash, fired
shots into a crowd, injuring three people. A junior officer in the battalion
was suspended from duty after the first incident.
The battalion is due to leave Northern Ireland shortly. It was sent in April
on a temporary basis to replace one of the reinforcement units deployed in
the province after an outbreak of violence late last year.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Managers set to back British Coal bid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SMITH, Labour Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REPRESENTATIVES of 6,000 managers at British Coal's pits are expected this
week to back moves which may lead to them joining a bid for the organisation
when it is privatised.
This would increase the likelihood of British Coal employees taking a large
stake even though the National Union of Mineworkers, the largest coalfield
union, strongly opposes privatisation.
Mr John Meads, general secretary of the British Association of Colliery
Managers, is likely on Thursday to receive the support of his union's
conference for investigating participation in a bid consortium.
The Union of Democratic Mineworkers has already declared its interest in an
employee buy-out. Whether the association joined with the UDM or formed a
separate group, its interest would increase the credibility of a buy-out.
The association would not regard any venture it entered as a management
buy-out, Mr Meads said. 'We want everybody - all employees - in this
together.' The likely sale of British Coal next year has already attracted
the interest of companies. The government indicated in its election
manifesto that at least some shares should go to employees.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Co-op merger may lead to new regional group
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NEGOTIATIONS between the Enfield and St Albans Co-operative Society, which
has a turnover of Pounds 43.6m, and the Co-operative Wholesale Society are
likely to lead to a new regional grouping with sales of more than Pounds
143m.
The proposed merger means a single region can be created with neighbouring
South Midlands (Pounds 72m turnover) and Milton Keynes (Pounds 28m).
CWS's retail turnover will rise to around Pounds 2bn, increasing its Co-op
retail share by one percentage point to 28.13 per cent. It overtook
Co-operative Retail Services as the largest retail society when it merged
with the Greater Nottingham society in March. Mergers last year between
Co-op retailers reduced the number of societies from 69 to 65.
The co-operative movement's congress in Scarborough yesterday announced
sales of Pounds 7.3bn last year. It maintained its 7.8 per cent share of the
food market and 4.6 per cent of the total retail market. The trading surplus
fell to Pounds 173m from Pounds 175m in 1990.

FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Council Services: Setting up shop in the council
marketplace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPULSORY competitive tendering is still in its infancy. Although a few
adventurous Tory councils contracted out services in the mid 1980s,
compulsory tendering officially began less than four years ago. Before then,
most councillors of all parties - not just Labour - resisted the idea, and
addressed it seriously only after the 1988 Local Government Act forced them
to.
The learning curve has been steeper still for companies, faced not only by
the formidable legal complexities of bidding, but by the variety of type of
work and size of contracts. Councils range from tiny rural districts to
large metropolitan authorities.
The act specifies services to be put out to tender and the authorities
obliged to tender them - all district and county councils, as well as
police, fire and waste authorities and urban development corporations. It
also sets out a framework, the most notable features of which are the length
of contracts - mostly between five and seven years; a detailed procedure for
inviting tenders - at least three companies expressing an interest must be
invited to tender; an exemption from tendering for services with an annual
contract value of less than Pounds 100,000; a requirement on local-authority
in-house teams to make a 5 per cent annual rate of return on capital
employed, and provisions to prevent anti-competitive behaviour.
Such behaviour has been exceptional, even among Labour authorities. In most
councils the tendering process is in the hands of officers, with members
involved only in setting specifications and formally allocating contracts.
The Department of the Environment has issued only 44 orders requiring
authorities to explain their action over a contract. More frequent are
complaints from companies about the packaging of contracts in a way to suit
the in-house team.
As the first round of tendering draws to a close, the study highlights
significant trends:
Refuse collection and street cleaning: with more than a quarter of contracts
now held by the private sector, this has proved the most fruitful area.
Councils traditionally used a single department to run both services, and a
large proportion of contracts are for both services. The average value of
contracts is accordingly high, at around Pounds 1.2m.
The early stages of tendering saw a number of management buy-outs, notably
at Westminster City Council where MRS Environmental Services won a Pounds
12m contract and has gone on to secure three others totalling Pounds 4m.
Since then subsidiaries of French and Spanish multinationals have moved to
the fore. Onyx UK, the largest player with 20 contracts worth Pounds 25m a
year, was formed by two French water companies in 1990 and its subsequent
growth has largely been through acquisitions of British concerns - notably
UK Waste - which specialise in local-authority work.
The private sector has fared increasingly well in the past two years. Its
share of contracts has risen from 14 per cent of the August 1990 tranche to
half of those awarded this January. Its success has not been limited to
smaller packages: private contractors have done better in London than any
other region, taking 43 per cent of the capital's market.
Building cleaning: by proportion of contracts, this is the most successful
field for the private sector, which won a majority of contracts awarded at
the start of this year. Since the work is labour-intensive, with low
start-up costs, its success is perhaps unsurprising. Local authorities have
tended to split the work in two, contracting school cleaning separately.
Civic cleaning, the smaller of the two operations, has proved most
attractive to private operators. Initial Contract Services, owned by BET,
the UK's largest contract services company, is the lead player, with 47
contracts worth Pounds 17m a year.
Catering: in spite of the private sector's experience in catering, it has
made little impact, winning fewer than a tenth of contracts. School and
welfare catering has proved particularly unattractive to private operators,
given the number of outlets, and term and pricing constraints. Smaller
contracts in other areas have proved more enticing, but catering remains the
untrodden field of tendering. Grounds maintenance: councils were obliged to
tender for this sector over a five-year period, and a large tranche of
first-round contracts has still to be awarded this year and next. Contract
specifications have proved difficult. The main private player - Brophy, with
53 contracts worth Pounds 14m a year - was tiny prior to tendering.
Grounds maintenance has attracted a large number of successful cross-border
bids by council teams, with one in 10 contracts awarded to another council's
direct-labour service. The legality of the practice is hotly disputed but
has yet to be tested directly in the courts.
Leisure services: everything from swimming pools to golf courses, with
facilities and practices varying enormously between authorities. The sector
is proving susceptible to management buy-outs. But councils retain control
over admissions prices and opening hours.
There are two useful tips for potential bidders say those in the know. Meet
council officers at an early stage - particularly to ascertain the quality
of service expected, which is often ill-defined in the specification. And do
not underestimate the cost of bidding - most of all the first time round.
Vehicle maintenance: private companies have taken almost a fifth of the
market. Local-authority practice in transferring vehicle stock with
responsibility for maintenance varies widely, as do arrangements for depot
facilities. Half of all contracts fall between Pounds 100,000 and Pounds
500,000, and more authorities have declared their contracts de minimis in
this sector than in any other.
More than half of all tendered contracts have gone to four leading
companies. Transfleet Services, a joint venture between Lex Services and
Lombard North Central, which merged with Chart Services UK in 1989, has been
most successful, holding nine contracts worth Pounds 4.7m a year.

FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Council Services: Town halls fall to the commercial
revolution - Contracts awarded to date total Pounds 1.9bn a year / From
refuse collection to leisure management the provision of services is big
business
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
MR NICHOLAS RIDLEY'S vision of local authorities meeting once a year to hand
out contracts may not be shared by the post-Thatcher regime. But the phrase
'enabling councils' is on all politicians' lips - and compulsory competitive
tendering (CCT) is seen by the government as one way of creating them.
The survey below summarises a comprehensive study of the effect of tendering
on local authorities across Great Britain, published today by the Institute
of Public Finance, a research arm of the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy. It will be followed by regular FT updates, based on
CCT bulletins to be published by the institute, on the position sector by
sector.
Tendering is worth big money. Contracts awarded to date total Pounds 1.9bn a
year, with the typical refuse collection contract alone worth Pounds 1.2m a
year.
The private sector is advancing steadily. Its share of the local authority
market is now appreciable: of the seven main sectors currently subject to
tendering - refuse collection, street cleaning, building cleaning, vehicle
maintenance, grounds maintenance, sports and leisure management and catering
 -in all but one (catering) private operators have won more than 18 per cent
of contracts put out to tender. Most councils now have a private contractor
providing at least one of their main services.
Like privatisation, compulsory competitive tendering is a Tory policy which
came late, started slowly amid political controversy, but is coming to be
taken for granted by unions and opposition parties alike.
Labour fought the general election committed to end tendering - 'but by the
next election it will be a way of life', said one of the party's prominent
council leaders.
The result? A revolution in local authority culture - not least in the 41
per cent of councils in which the in-house labour force has so far won all
the main contracts.
For the first time in most authorities, the 'client' and 'contractor'
functions have been separated - divorcing the setting of standards and
monitoring of performance from the management of service delivery. One
leader of a large authority confessed that before compulsory competitive
tendering he did not even know how many staff the council employed.
Research by Mr Simon Domberger, an associate of the Institute for Fiscal
Studies, indicates that cost savings of about 20 per cent have been made by
putting refuse collection out to tender. The precise figure is disputed, but
none deny that real reductions have been achieved.
Mr Tom McGuirk, manager of the IPF's competitive tendering information
service, said: 'The definition of service standards as set out in contract
specifications largely did not exist prior to the introduction of compulsory
competitive tendering.'
With citizens' charters as profuse locally as nationally, standards look set
to be the refrain of the 1990s.

<TEXT>
LUTON is a political weather-vane. Labour wrested control of its district
council from the Tories in last year's local elections, but narrowly failed
to unseat Luton South's Tory MP in the general election.
Yet political gyrations have had virtually no impact on Luton council's
approach to compulsory competitive tendering. The town's former Tory leaders
were keen to use the tendering process to improve efficiency, but equally
keen to see contracts remain in-house if possible. Mr Roy Davies, the
council's Labour leader, insists that 'on its own, CCT has done nothing to
improve services' - but the new Labour council's policy is a carbon copy of
the former Tory administration's approach.
With the first round of tendering almost complete, all the principal service
contracts have been won by the council's direct labour force. But the refuse
collection and street cleaning contract stayed in-house only after a
conflict which casts a spotlight on one sensitive area of tendering - the
right of councils to demand hefty performance bonds.
UK Waste, now a subsidiary of Onyx UK, the French-owned group, bid Pounds
1.8m a year for the refuse and street-cleaning contract against a bid of
Pounds 2.2m by the in-house team. The council included a performance bond of
Pounds 1.1m as part of the contract terms. UK Waste, the only serious
private bidder, made its offer on that condition, but argued afterwards that
the bond was an unfair burden and failed to provide it, whereupon Luton
withdrew the contract from it. The council then put the contract out to
tender again and gave the services back to the direct labour force - the
lowest bidder - subject to the same bond.
Private-sector competition for contracts is growing tougher. The
grounds-maintenance contract is split into three packages: the first,
awarded in 1989, went to the direct-labour force with no serious challenge.
The second, out in 1990, had one strong private contender, and the third,
now out to tender, has attracted considerable private-sector interest.

<TEXT>
THE contracting-out culture is spreading far beyond services such as refuse
collection and street cleaning. Competitive tendering will extend across the
public services over the next few years into housing, care of the elderly,
health and education. It will also reach the Civil Service.
Services will be provided increasingly by independent organisations under
contract to councils, government departments, health authorities and other
public bodies. There will be opportunities for the private and voluntary
sectors to take over provision of services previously performed by public
monopolies.
Compulsory competitive tendering in local government is already due to be
extended beyond direct services to the public such as cleaning, catering and
vehicle maintenance. Core town-hall functions such as architecture, planning
and the collection of local taxes are being considered for contracting out
under legislation passed in the last parliament.
Contracting out such white-collar services presents an extra challenge
because defining and enforcing the quality of service is more complicated
than with emptying dustbins or mowing grass. Officials at the environment
department are considering more than 500 responses to a consultative paper.
The extension of contracting out may have to wait until councils have
introduced internal trading accounts which will make the costs of different
functions more transparent. Bidding is likely to involve the sort of
two-stage process developed for auctioning ITV contracts in which bidders
must first prove that they can reach a quality threshold before their bids
are considered.
The government is also keen for councils to contract out management of their
housing stock to housing associations and other private-sector
organisations. The introduction of community-care reforms next year will
make councils responsible for purchasing care for the elderly and
handicapped from a wide range of providers. Those will include the voluntary
and private sectors as well as the councils' social services departments.
Critics of compulsory competitive tendering claim that it has had only a
limited impact because most contracts are won by council workforces. This is
certainly the case, as figures from the Chartered Institute of Public
Finance and Accountancy show.
But even when the work stays in-house, the process of tendering shakes up
the service. The council workforce must defeat the opposition with a bid
which makes a 5 per cent rate of return on capital. This in effect turns it
into a semi-independent organisation in which managers must introduce new
working practices to reduce costs and improve the quality of service.
A similar revolution in contracting out is under way in the National Health
Service and central government. The government's reforms are turning health
authorities into commissioning bodies which buy in health care from NHS
hospitals, trust hospitals and even the private sector.
Even in Whitehall, radical moves are under way to contract out much of the
work of delivering central-government services. A white paper published in
November suggested that putting Civil Service functions out to tender could
save as much as 25 per cent of the cost of Pounds 20bn a year.
Some government support services such as security, photocopying and cleaning
have already been contracted out.
But the Treasury is now considering departmental plans for contracting out a
much wider range of clerical, administrative and professional functions. For
example, more than one in four of the 65,000 jobs in the Inland Revenue are
to be opened to 'market testing' this summer.
The role of government at national and central level will change as
contracting out spreads. Rather than being involved in the day-to-day
management of public services, it will assume a regulatory role, guarding
the public interest on matters such as service quality, prices (where there
are charges) and competition.
Altogether it amounts to the biggest shake-up in public services since the
post-war Labour government created the modern welfare state. Whether it will
succeed in delivering the improved services to which the government is
committed remains to be seen.

THE European Community's prospects of taking a robust programme on global
warming to next week's Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro dimmed yesterday,
because of delays in finalising the details of the energy tax the European
Commission approved two weeks ago.
EC environment ministers meeting in Brussels today had been expected to give
provisional endorsement to the tax. But it became clear yesterday that the
draft directive on combatting carbon dioxide emissions is not yet ready.
This largely technical hold-up puts Mr Carlo Ripa di Meana, EC environment
commissioner, in a delicate position. The commissioner has repeatedly said
he will go to Rio only if he has a firm EC position to defend.
Such a position would have to include, Mr Ripa di Meana has said, support
from the Twelve for the Commission's energy tax; EC commitment to a near
doubling of development aid within the Climate Change convention due to be
signed in Rio; and resolution of the EC's two-year wrangle on where to
locate the European Environment Agency. It is not clear ministers can
resolve any of these issues today.
Member states such as the UK, while prepared to examine the case for a tax
to cut emissions, are unwilling to make a commitment until they see the
detailed implications. Spain, however, is concerned that an energy tax could
slow its industrial development.
But some northern states, led by Germany, support the tax and are angry the
Commission has made its proposal dependent on US and Japanese willingness to
adopt a similar anti-emissions strategy.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Saudi oil move boosts Opec hawks: Why hardliners will be
pleased with last week's meeting in Vienna
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries' meeting last week
provided unexpectedly good news for the cartel's traditional price hawks -
countries such as Iran, Algeria, Nigeria and Libya, which prefer Opec output
agreements to keep supply tight to squeeze the oil price higher.
This should be the effect of Opec's decision in Vienna last Friday to 'roll
over' its second-quarter output ceiling of 22.98m barrels a day into the
third quarter, allowing only Kuwait to boost output as it catches up lost
ground. Indeed oil traders yesterday said the deal could create what one
called a 'serious bull market' for crude.
For the first time since before the Gulf war Opec may be within reach of its
'reference price' of Dollars 21 a barrel for the cartel's basket of crudes -
a figure Mr Ginanjar Kartasasmita, Indonesia's oil minister, said yesterday
could be attained by September. (Last week the basket price hovered above
Dollars 18.50 a barrel.)
This is unexpected because since the Gulf crisis, when Saudi Arabia boosted
production from 5m barrels a day to above 8m b/d to replace lost Iraqi and
Kuwaiti output, the kingdom has clung jealously to its increased share of
Opec output, now over 30 per cent, and, as the price hawks see it, used its
unmatchable oil market weight to depress prices.
Last week's meeting therefore looked set to be another Saudi tussle with the
hawks - the kingdom suggested before the meeting that it wanted Opec's
ceiling raised by 1m b/d to 24m b/d, but with Iran, leading the hawks,
calling for a cut.
Then something odd happened. Instead of insisting on its pre-talks position,
Saudi Arabia quickly agreed that a roll-over, allowing for Kuwait, would be
fine.
Odder still, the Saudis arrived without Mr Hisham Nazer, the oil minister,
who was said to be 'exhausted' from international trips.
Oil analysts professed bafflement. A market rumour that King Fahd, the Saudi
ruler, was ill went around the oil market - a rumour Saudi delegates angrily
denied. But what were the Saudis up to?
Officially, the kingdom, led in the talks by Mr Fayez Badr, a junior
minister, decided early that no agreement could be reached to raise the
ceiling to 24m b/d, that even a lower ceiling of 23.7m b/d would prove
divisive, and, therefore, that a roll-over plus extra Kuwaiti production was
the best compromise.
The deal will, Opec estimates, see the cartel pumping 23.5m b/d in the third
quarter, 'with some leakages', in the words of one official.
In fact, since most industry sources suggest Opec is already pumping
23.5m-23.6m b/d, the cartel's output by September could be near the 24m b/d
Saudi Arabia chose as its starting figure, which represents its estimate of
the call on Opec crude for the quarter. So to that extent the kingdom got
what it wanted.
Furthermore, Saudi Arabia, in common with the price hawks - which these days
include heavily strapped Kuwait - will be glad of the extra revenues an
additional Dollars 2-Dollars 3 per barrel will bring to help defray its
hefty budget deficit. Its soft-pedalling was also good for Opec harmony.
But these factors may not account entirely for the kingdom's shift towards a
higher-price oil policy.
Another which might, however, is the European Community's decision to back a
carbon tax worth Dollars 10 on a barrel-of-oil-equivalent by the year 2000,
designed to restrain oil consumption and curb carbon dioxide emissions.
No Saudi delegates explicity linked their shift towards allowing oil prices
to rise to their opposition to the proposed tax. But none lost any
opportunity to make clear the kingdom's distaste for the proposal -
something Mr Nazer expressed strongly in talks before the Opec meeting
between EC and Gulf ministers in Kuwait.
'Excessive petroleum taxation' in the EC has, he said, already risen from
Dollars 7 a barrel in 1973 to Dollars 56 in 1991, while taxes on coal, which
produces more carbon dioxide than oil, were lower.
Mr Nazer also pointed out overall EC taxes on oil raked in Dollars 210bn in
1991, while the oil exporters in the period earned just Dollars 64bn for
their oil exports.
Should the tax go through, Mr Nazer said, 'Producers will find themselves in
a dilemma of overspending to raise their productive capacities to ensure
security of supplies while taxation policies aim at curtailing demand in
consumer countries.'
This, Mr Nazer concluded, 'would ultimately affect. . . our relations with
our trading partners.'
Saudi Arabia - the world's largest oil exporter and a single commodity
economy - the minister was suggesting, will not sit idle while the EC
proposes a tax which will hurt its revenues while adding to EC governments'
coffers. 'It is a question of who earns the economic rent from oil,' said
one Gulf Arab oil official in Vienna.
By backing higher Opec oil prices, therefore, the kingdom has issued a
gentle reminder that its previous price-levelling policies should not be
taken for granted.
Moreover, the rest of Opec will fall swiftly behind Saudi moves to resist
the carbon tax.
As Mr Nordine Ait Laossine, Algeria's oil minister, said in Vienna, if the
EC wants to raise oil prices for the consumer, 'we can very well do that for
them'.

   THE KARI-OCA INDIAN VILLAGE, RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE grounds of a mental asylum were the bizarre setting yesterday for the
first official event of the UN Conference on Environment and Development,
better known as the Earth Summit.
Aborigines, inuit (eskimos), North American Indians, tribal Africans and
Amazonian Indians in full paint and feathers gathered together in a mock
Indian village in the grounds of Curicica Mental Hospital on the hills
outside Rio de Janeiro for the first ever World Conference of Indigenous
People, much to the amusement of the inmates.
Most had come by aircraft and car, rejecting the grass huts of the Kari-oca
village built by Indians with authentic materials from the Xingu National
Park, in favour of air-conditioned hotels in the city.
Some 500 Indians from five continents will meet all week to discuss topics
such as biodiversity, intellectual property and sustainable development, to
prepare a document to be presented to Mr Maurice Strong, secretary general
of the Earth Summit.
According to Mr Marcos Terena, a Brazilian Indian chief co-ordinating the
conference, the aim is 'to ensure that indigenous people have a voice' in
the official summit which starts next Wednesday, and are not 'just
considered in folkloric terms'.
Specific concerns include recognition of intellectual property rights for
use of medicinal plants from Indian areas, sovereignty rights and deciding
on a position for the 500th anniversary of the European discovery of the
Americas.
Mr Donald Rocas, an Indian from Costa Rica, says: 'This conference is
fundamental because it deals with all our lives - not just those of
indigenous people but also non-indigenous who need to learn from us how to
look after land and resources crucial for the planet's survival.'
Ms Helen Corbett, who is leading an Aborigine delegation from Australia,
says: 'The main issue for us is sovereignty for aborigines to prevent
destruction of our land and death of our people.'
However, there is doubt over how representative the conference delegates
are. Brazilian Indians spoken to in Para and Amazonas over the last month
were completely unaware of the event and expressed interest in visiting Rio.
The Earth Summit will be the first big post-cold-war conference, with around
18 new European countries in attendance. Mr Marcos Azambuja, Brazil's chief
negotiator, describes it as 'the most important non-confrontational
conference since San Francisco in 1945'.
Over the weekend the 10m residents of Rio had their first taste of what is
to come with the testing of security operations, which brought traffic to a
complete standstill and caused some panicked residents to think a military
coup had been launched. Some 6,000 army officers patrolled the streets in
tanks with heavy arms, practising for the summit, at which about 125 heads
of state are expected.
One of the leaders of the Brazilian delegation complained after being tailed
by three riflemen: 'The military seem to be taking things to extremes - are
we really going to open tank fire if any problems emerge ?'
For those concerned about pickpockets, Rio's most famous escaped British
train robber, Ronald Biggs, is giving security hints on a daily radio
programme throughout the conference.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LEGAL challenges were planned yesterday to the latest US order requiring its
Coast Guard forcibly to return fleeing Haitian boat people.
President George Bush issued the directive on Sunday, saying that US
facilities at its Guantanamo naval base in Cuba were being swamped by the
flow of Haitian refugees - now estimated to exceed 12,000, and raising fears
that southern Florida would also be overwhelmed. He thus reversed an earlier
decision last Thursday ordering that Haitian boats not be intercepted.
Human rights and legal groups representing Haitian refugees objected that
forcibly returning the Haitians without first ascertaining their right to
asylum in the US was a violation of international law. Congressman Stephen
Solarz, the New York Democrat, yesterday called the US decision a cruel move
that 'betrays our most fundamental values'.
The White House cast its action in humanitarian terms, saying many of the
boats were patently unseaworthy and it was continuing to screen asylum
petitions, mostly in Guantanamo but also in Haiti itself. It said that since
last September's coup, about 9,000 out of 34,000 applications for asylum had
been processed and 6,000 US residency permits granted.
However, US policy has been to deter Haitians from fleeing their island.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Alan Bond, the bankrupt former Australian entrepreneur, yesterday pleaded
not guilty in a Western Australian court to a charge of dishonestly inducing
a businessman to take part in a ADollars 370m (Pounds 158m) corporate
rescue.
The charges relate to a 1987 attempt by the Western Australian state
government and business community to rescue the Perth-based Rothwells
merchant bank, run by Mr Laurie Connell.
Mr Bond, former chairman of Bond Corporation Holdings, is alleged to have
persuaded Mr Brian Coppin, a Perth businessman, to subscribe for shares in
Rothwells without disclosing that Bond Corp would earn an ADollars 16m fee
for helping to arrange the rescue.
Mr Coppin said he was approached by Mr Bond to subscribe ADollars 20m to the
Rothwells rescue, subsequently reduced to ADollars 8m.
He said his commitment was finalised at 7am on Monday October 26 1987. But
he was not told of Bond Corp's fee until November 14.
Mr Connell said he had resisted requests for fees totalling ADollars 30m
from Mr Bond and another businessman who helped arrange the rescue. He later
agreed a personal liability for ADollars 16m to Bond Corp.
The Rothwells crisis followed the worldwide stock market collapse in October
1987, when the bank's deposits came under pressure. Bond Corp helped put
together a refinancing deal in which Mr Connell contributed ADollars 70m in
subordinated debt, backed by a ADollars 150m share issue and a state
government indemnity for ADollars 150m against a loan facility provided by
National Australia Bank.
Rothwells collapsed in November 1988, and is the focus of a royal commission
inquiry into relationships between politicians and businessmen in Western
Australia.
The trial, which is expected to last all week, follows a declaration of
bankruptcy against Mr Bond last month.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID DODWELL, World Trade Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TRADE NEGOTIATORS from the US and the EC will meet in Washington tomorrow in
a test of whether last week's EC farm reforms can provide a basis for
breaking a long-standing deadlock in the Uruguay Round of talks on world
trade liberalisation.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, will for the first time join
negotiations, which will tackle differences on farm trade, trade in
services, and on market access. The EC yesterday described his entry into
the talks as 'significant', suggesting the US gives high priority to finding
a settlement.
EC agreement on reform of its common agricultural policy, finalised after
four days of negotiation last week, has raised hopes of a breakthrough on
farm trade, over which the US and the EC have been at loggerheads for five
months. US officials have persistently complained that they could not
negotiate with an EC which was constantly changing its position on farm
trade.
However, EC negotiators have also made it clear that the CAP reform package
is a 'take it or leave it' deal in which further EC concessions cannot be
expected.
The main EC concession is to cut wheat prices by 29 per cent over three
years. This far exceeds US demands that EC domestic price supports for wheat
should be cut by 20 per cent. It is also expected to lead to deep cuts in
subsidised farm exports. The US has been demanding a 24 per cent cut in the
volume of subsidised exports, and a 36 per cent cut in value terms.
The EC wants the US to accept that the compensation payments to farmers,
agreed under the CAP reform, do not distort production. It also wants the US
to restrain exports of cereal substitutes.

ISRAELI aircraft bombed Lebanese territory yesterday for the fifth time in

pro-Iranian Hizbollah militia.
Prime Minister Yitzhak Shamir vowed Israel would continue to hit Hizbollah
targets until guerrillas halted attacks on Israel's self-declared border
security zone in Lebanon.
The latest violence has raised speculation that Israel might launch a
'limited war' against Syria, which has 35,000 troops in Lebanon and is
accused by Israel of arming and supporting Hizbollah. Syria accused Israel
of trying to kill the Mideast peace talks.
About 14,000 people have abandoned homes in southern Lebanon and the Bekaa

AFGHANISTAN'S two warring guerrilla leaders emerged from talks yesterday
saying they had agreed on a lasting peace, Reuter reports from Pul-e-Charki,
Afghanistan.
New defence minister Ahmad Shah Masood and fundamentalist guerrilla chief
Gulbuddin Hekmatyar promised no return to the open warfare which erupted in
Kabul after the overthrow of former Soviet-backed President Najibullah last
month.
The two men spent seven hours in a tent in a dusty gully 10km from Kabul,
accompanied by mediators from Saudi Arabia and Pakistan, before emerging to
declare agreement. They then joined together in Moslem prayers.
Guerrillas from both men's forces stationed nearby lit up the sky over Kabul
with celebratory gunfire as news of the peace agreement spread.
Mediators announced they had reached a pact between the two men last week,
but that document was vaguely-worded and attempts to bring them together
were repeatedly cancelled by officials citing security worries.
Yesterday's talks were held on territory held by Mr Hekmatyar's
Hezb-i-Islami forces, in a spot ringed by heavily-armed and nervous
guerrillas. His guerrillas were forced out of Kabul to its southern fringes
in the battles of late April and early May.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Leaders to meet over cost of unification: Top-level attempt
to reach an accord follows poor support from voters in Berlin
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Helmut Kohl, the German chancellor, and Mr Bjorn Engholm, leader of the
opposition Social Democrats (SPD), will attempt at top-level talks tomorrow
to cobble together a basic understanding on financing the rising costs of
German unification.
Both sought yesterday to present themselves as open-minded and ready to
compromise after their respective parties - Mr Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU) and the SPD, its main national rival - suffered a humiliating
drain of support in Sunday's local council elections in Berlin.
At the same time both men firmly ruled out any talk of a 'grand coalition'
to deal with the country's financial squeeze.
The Berlin results showed widespread dissatisfaction with the two big
national parties, large-scale abstention (the total turnout was at a
post-war low of 61.2 per cent), and a drift to more extreme parties on the
left and right. Opponents of a grand coalition in Bonn point to the fact
that the Berlin backlash is aimed precisely at such a ruling coalition in
the city senate.
The biggest beneficiary of the Berlin result was the Party of Democratic
Socialism (PDS), the renamed former Socialist Unity party, alias the
Communist party of East Germany, which won 11.3 per cent of the total vote,
and 29.7 per cent in the districts of former East Berlin.
Mr Gregor Gysi, leader of the PDS, said he was satisfied with his party's
recovery, which proved that it could no longer be ignored at local and
national level.
All the established parties voiced relief that the extreme right-wing
Republicans only managed to achieve 8.3 per cent of the overall vote, short
of the 10 per cent which had been forecast in opinion polls. They won only
5.4 per cent of the vote in east Berlin, but in the west of the city managed
9.9 per cent.
Mr Kohl's CDU slumped in east Berlin to 14.3 per cent of support, although
it managed to top the poll in the west with 35 per cent: overall it lay
second to the SPD, which won a constant 31.8 per cent on both sides of the
former Berlin Wall. Indeed, the SPD was the only party whose support
suggested that east and west Berlin were both parts of a single political
system.
The Berlin results confirmed a growing disenchantment with the main
political parties in Bonn, refocusing attention on tomorrow's talks.
In an interview with the German press agency (DPA), Mr Kohl said yesterday
that he was prepared to discuss 'quite openly all the different proposals'.
While he rejected the latest call, by federal President Richard von
Weizsacker, for a wealth tax to finance the cost of unification, he no
longer sought to limit the forthcoming debate.
'We must find a medium-term and long-term solution, a solution based on
reason, to the financing problems of the union, the federal states and the
local authorities,' he said.

FT  26 MAY 92 / West German industry in sombre mood
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN, FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE MOOD in west Germany's manufacturing industry has grown more pessimistic
about the country's immediate economic prospects in spite of
better-than-expected gross domestic product figures for the first quarter.
The results of the latest survey of business opinion by the Munich-based
economics institute, Ifo, showed no expectation of an early recovery in
exports. This view contrasts with a rather bullish economic assessment by Mr
Jurgen Mollemann, the economics minister.
On the other hand, Ifo reported an appreciable improvement in the business
mood in east Germany, where production is said to have stabilised. The most
optimistic sector of all, predictably, is the east German construction
industry, helped by big transfers of public and private funds from the west
to revive the economy.
The details were published yesterday as the main German public sector union,
the oTV, formally agreed to call off strike action in spite of a union
ballot rejecting a 5.4 per cent pay award.
That piece of news, along with Mr Mollemann's estimate of a 2.5-3.0 per cent
GDP growth in the first quarter, boosted German financial markets, although
the longer-term scenario still looks gloomy.
Last week's 5.8 per cent pay deal by IG Metall, the engineering workers'
union, has lifted the storm clouds of industrial conflict from the economy,
but that has yet to show through in business confidence. Indeed, the
business community is clearly concerned at the level of the award -
immediately adopted in both construction and printing industries - even
though relieved there will be no widespread strike action.
In his monthly commentary, Mr Mollemann said although the wage deals 'went
far beyond the improvement in productivity,' they should at least remove
uncertainty from enterprise planning.
Mr Helmut Schlesinger, the Bundesbank president, said he saw no chance of a
cut in German interest rates incurrent economic conditions, Reuter adds from
Frankfurt.
Mr Schlesinger said inflation was still running too high and wage increases,
although lower than in 1991, were still steep and could not be compensated
by increases in productivity. 'Under these circumstances, there is no chance
to reduce interest rates at this moment,' he said.
He expressed optimism that west German inflation could fall under 4 per cent
by the end of the year. West German inflation was running at a rate of 4.6
per cent in April.
He noted that west German wage increases also had an impact on east German
wage levels.
'The rise in wages is clearly lower than last year. . . but wage rises of
between 5.5 per cent and 6 per cent. . . are still comparatively high,' Mr
Schlesinger said, adding that wage increases of this size could not be
compensated for by productivity gains either in the west or in the east.

MERCEDES-BENZ yesterday launched its response to encroaching Japanese
quality car makers, unveiling its third - and possibly its last - car
factory on German soil. It did so with an unashamed display of self-esteem
and claims that those who charge that Germany is losing its ability to
compete should think again.
The Rastatt works, situated close to the border with Alsace, is 'surely and
simply the most up-to-date automotive factory in the world,' said Mr Werner
Niefer, chief executive of the Daimler-Benz vehicles subsidiary.
Its hallmarks were lean production and lean management. Not copied from the
Japanese or the Scandinavians, Mr Niefer said, but entirely 'made in
Germany'.
Flexible team working is the key element in the new manufacturing process.
Groups of 10 to 15 people plan their working schedules, mend their tools and
equipment, swap jobs when they choose and take collective responsibility for
the end product.
Rastatt has no conventional assembly line. Nor does it have a car park by
the loading bay, common in German car plants, where quality defects are
corrected. 'Quality is not brought about by subsequent inspection,' Mr
Niefer said. 'Quality is produced.'
The aim is to reduce production costs by up to 25 per cent, and to introduce
the lessons learnt, techniques tested and savings made at Rastatt into the
group's other factories in nearby Sindelfingen and Bremen in the north.
However, according to Mr Niefer, the company's cars are unlikely to become
cheaper. 'We will try to make sure they do not become more expensive,' was
the most he could offer.
In the long term, he believed the company could outstrip the performance of
its Japanese competitors. He added, however, they had access to cheaper
capital and benefited from longer working hours. These factors accounted for
an estimated 10 per cent of their cost advantage, and German companies could
do nothing to counter them.
The Rastatt plant, opening after eight years' planning and battles with
environmentalists, will be steadily extended over the next two years. Output
will rise from this year's target of 80 mid-range Mercedes a day to 360 by
the end of 1996.
Investment will climb from the DM500m (Pounds 170m) spent so far to more
than DM2bn.

FT  26 MAY 92 / EC set to decide on sanctions against Serbia
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
THE European Community will today decide whether to impose a comprehensive
package of economic sanctions against Serbia in an effort to stop the
fighting in the former Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
But western diplomats continue to caution against military intervention, and
Russia still opposes mandatory sanctions by the United Nations.
The mounting international pressure on Serbia coincides with negotiations in
Sarajevo, the Bosnian capital, on withdrawing Yugoslav federal army units
from city's barracks.
Over the past three weeks the army and Serb irregulars have blocked food,
water and medical supplies into the besieged city. Aid workers based in
Zagreb, the Croatian capital, said inhabitants of Sarajevo were near
starvation.
Yesterday army units started withdrawing from one of the barracks, but
Moslem forces prevented units from leaving two other barracks because the
Serb-dominated army had apparently refused to surrender their weapons.
In Mostar, south-eastern Bosnia, Croat and Serb forces continued to fight
for control of the city. The Moslem community, which makes up the majority
of the population, has fled to neighbouring Croatia and other parts of
Bosnia.
Today's EC meeting follows a move by the US and Canada to block landing
rights for JAT, the Yugoslav airline, which is based in Belgrade, the
Serbian capital. Both countries have recalled their ambassadors. EC
countries recalled their ambassadors from Serbia last week.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, is calling for tough sanctions
against Serbia. Speaking in Lisbon at the end of an EC-sponsored conference
on aid to former Soviet republics, Mr Baker told other countries to 'stop
looking for reasons not to take action.
'There are 35,000 diabetics now who have no insulin. There are 6,000 women
and babies who have no medicine, baby formula or milk (in Sarajevo),' he
told jounalists. 'Anyone who is looking for a reason not to act, or arguing
somehow that action in the face of this kind of nightmare is not warranted
at this time. . . is on the wrong wavelength.'
Mr John Major, British prime minister, last night gave full backing to Mr
Baker's call, Philip Stephens writes. Speaking as he arrived in Warsaw for a
four-day visit to central Europe, Mr Major made it plain he wants today's
meeting of EC governments in Brussels to agree measures well beyond the
token protest advocated by some EC governments.

<TEXT>
AZERBAIJAN and Armenia are to meet on Thursday, a month earlier than
proposed by the Conference on Security and Co-operation in Europe (CSCE), in
an attempt to find a solution to continuing hostilities in the region.
Mr Suleyman Demirel, the Turkish prime minister, who is on a two-day visit
to Moscow, said yesterday that a meeting had been arranged by the CSCE ahead
of the proposed Minsk conference, tentatively set for June 29.
Mr Hikmet Cetin, Turkey's foreign minister, warned that if a meeting was
left any later it would allow Armenia to consolidate its recent military
gains, particularly in the Lachin corridor from Armenia to the enclave of
Nagorno-Karabakh, where more than 1,500 people have been killed.
This week's meeting could have a vital bearing on Mr Demirel's standing at
home, where he is criticised by opposition parties and the press for his
cautious approach to the conflict.
Continuing hostilities also pose a challenge to Turkey's regional ambitions
just three weeks after Mr Demirel's successful week-long tour through
central Asia, where he sought to reaffirm Turkey's cultural, linguistic and
religious links with ethnic Turks.
Mr Demirel will have found President Turgut Ozal's recent call for Turkish
troop intervention unhelpful. But the leader is under growing pressure amid
Azeri claims that Armenian forces have stepped up attacks on Nakhichevan,
the autonomous Azeri territory bordering Turkey and Iran.
'The status quo of Nakhichevan cannot be changed without the consent of
Turkey. I hope no one should dare it,' Mr Demirel said in Moscow yesterday,
in a clear warning to Armenian nationalists .
Thursday's meeting is due to be attended by officials from the US, France,
UK and Russia, A venue has still to be decided.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Mountleigh receivership deals blow to lenders: Barclays
among banks owed Pounds 400m by property group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON and VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
RECEIVERS were called in yesterday at Mountleigh, one of the UK's biggest
property groups and owner of Spain's second biggest store chain, Galerias
Preciados.
Mountleigh, one of the UK's most ambitious companies in the 1980s, owes
Pounds 147m to bondholders and about Pounds 400m to banks, led by Barclays
of the UK and Citicorp of the US. Receivers and bankers could not quantify
yesterday the losses likely to be suffered by the company's creditors.
However, its receivership has dealt another severe blow to banks operating
in the UK, which expect to lose billions of pounds this year on their
exposure to the UK property market.
Mountleigh's receivership comes after months of attempts by the company and
its banks to prop it up. The receivership was triggered by the collapse of
attempts to raise funds by selling Merry Hill shopping centre in Dudley, in
the West Midlands, in order to make substantial payment to holders of Swiss
bonds.
It was due to repay SFr150m (Pounds 56m) tomorrow. Interest payments on
another bond issue were missed last week.
Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Stephen James of KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy
firm, were appointed yesterday to the main UK holding company. The decision
to appoint them followed the breakdown of talks with bank creditors on a
planned financial restructuring for the group.
A meeting of directors on Saturday decided the company could no longer
fulfil its debt obligations and the main bank creditors, led by Barclays and
Citicorp, were invited to appoint receivers. Other principal bankers are
thought to include Bankers Trust of the US, Credit Lyonnais of France,
Switzerland's Credit Suisse, Unibank from Denmark and three UK banks,
Lloyds, National Westminster and Royal Bank of Scotland.
All the bank debt is secured on the assets. The receivers said Mountleigh's
property portfolio was worth at least Pounds 400m.
Mr James said he expected Mountleigh's UK subsidiaries to follow the parent
into receivership. But receivers will probably not be appointed to Galerias
Preciados. Bankers flew to Spain at the weekend to reassure the subsidiary
it would continue to receive their financial support. Mr Hayward, in Madrid,
said the chain would have to be sold. A potential buyer has already made an
offer for the group, which last year had sales of Dollars 980m (Pounds
554m).
In the UK, the company is best known for the Merry Hill shopping
development, a shopping centre in Camberley, Surrey, and its half share in
the Criterion centre in London's Piccadilly. It also owns properties across
continental Europe, which are unaffected by the UK receivership.
Notices appeared yesterday in Swiss financial newspapers calling a meeting
of bondholders on June 10. Mountleigh was planning to ask investors to defer
all interest and principle repayments until July 31, when it had hoped to be
able to present a full debt restructuring plan.
However, the failure to reach agreement with secured bank creditors, which
rank above bondholders in the event of winding up, meant that a full
restructuring could not be achieved.
Mr James said the receivers would examine the assets of the company and
would 'consider an orderly disposal programme' so that creditors can be
repaid.
In the past three months, Olympia &amp; York, developer of Canary Wharf; Heron
International, a property and trading group; Speyhawk, a UK developer; and
Randsworth, a property investor, have run into serious financial trouble.
Citicorp and Barclays have big exposures to several of these companies.
In the 1980s, Mountleigh was transformed from a small wool maker into a
property company with a market value so high it felt able to bid Pounds 2bn
for Storehouse in 1987.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Moslems flee Serb vision of ethnic purity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ZAGREB
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AS THE federal army and Serb irregulars continue to starve into submission
the people of Sarajevo, the capital of Bosnia-Hercegovina, inhabitants of
the small town of Rudo are only now beginning to feel the impact of ethnic
war.
Located south-east of Sarajevo, Rudo's population of 12,000, three-quarters
Serb and the rest Moslem, peacefully co-existed until May 21. That was when
the White Eagles arrived.
The White Eagles is a fanatical armed Serb organisation, which appears
determined to establish ethnically pure Serb areas in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
When they arrived in Rudo, Dr Jasmir Brajnanac, a 28-year-old doctor, and
Moslem, decided it was time to leave. 'I had no choice,' she explained as
she waited for help and accommodation from the Moslem Crisis Centre in
Zagreb, the capital of Croatia.
'On May 21, the White Eagles demanded I take an oath of loyalty to Serbia
and the new Yugoslavia. This was no simple oath. It involved agreeing to
military conscription, a curfew, permission to leave the town, and using the
health centre to treat Serb military personnel. I did not want to sign this
piece of paper. I fled.'
After two days and nights of travelling through forests and along
side-roads, Ms Brajnanac reached Croatia, where she joined 238,480 refugees
and displaced people from Bosnia-Hercegovina, and another quarter of a
million made homeless or displaced by the war in Croatia.
Ms Vesjna Camka, a Moslem born in Banja Luka, northern Bosnia, and who has
also sought refuge in Zagreb, said those Moslems who remained behind in
Bosnia were either the old or the young, determined to fight for Bosnia's
independence.
'The old are afraid to leave because they believe they will lose their
pensions and apartments. Already, in Banja Luka, the Serbs are going through
all the apartments in order to find out who is not a Serb,' Ms Camka said.
She added that many young Moslems had taken to the forests to fight.
Even in Croatia, attempts continue to carve out ethnically pure regions in
eastern Slavonia, east of the republic, despite the deployment there 10 days
ago of United Nations peacekeeping troops.
On Sunday night, 22 Croats from the village of Tovarnik, eastern Slavonia,
were ordered out of their homes and on to a bus by Serb irregulars.
'This is a policy of ethnic cleansing,' said Mr Mik Magnusson, the UN's
chief spokesman in Croatia. 'These Croats were pressurised by the Serbs to
leave their villages. We brought them back to their homes. We will have to
guard them. But as soon as we turn our backs, a bomb will be thrown at
them.'
'Those Serbs who were forced by Croats to flee their homes from western
Slavonia, central Croatia, are now being resettled (by Serbs) in houses in
eastern Slavonia which were once inhabited by Croats,' said Mr Magnusson.
Although UN officials yesterday said one of their main tasks in eastern
Slavonia was to create conditions for those people who wanted to return to
their homes, a group of poor, elderly Croats who are from the region, but
who have taken refuge in Zagreb, said they had little hope in the future.
'My pig is dead. My house is burnt. My Serb neighbours and friends have
fled. Everybody fears revenge. What would I be returning to?' asked Mrs
Marija Culic, 81.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Brazilian markets hit by Collor allegations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   RIO DE JANEIRO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BRAZIL'S financial markets took fright yesterday as pressure grew on
President Fernando Collor to resign after allegations of corruption,
extortion and cocaine.
The allegations were made by the president's younger brother, Pedro, in an
extensive videotaped interview with the leading news magazine Veja.
Amid calls for a congressional inquiry and his impeachment, the president
began legal action against his brother to 'defend his honour'.
The country's stock markets fell sharply as investors' fears mounted, the
main share index dropping 7.4 per cent. A broker in Sao Paulo described
trading as 'awful', adding: 'The impact of the news published by Veja over
the weekend was terrible.' Brazil's central bank stepped in to contain falls
in the cruizeiro.
The situation is especially embarrassing just a week before Mr Collor is due
to open the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro.
The crisis in Brazil's First Family began with a series of attacks by Mr
Pedro Collor on Mr Paulo Cesar Farias, the president's campaign treasurer
and friend. Pedro's revelation that he had compiled a video elaborating
alleged frauds by Mr Farias, which he intended to hand to the police, caused
stock markets to fall almost 10 per cent in real terms last week.
The row has split the Collor clan and after failing to silence her youngest
son, Dona Leda, the family matriarch, last week dismissed him from running
the Collor media empire, claiming that he was mentally unstable. A furious
Pedro is undergoing psychiatric tests to prove his sanity and has stepped up
his attacks.
Pedro's latest allegations are directed at his presidential brother, whom he
accuses of a range of alleged frauds, trying to seduce his wife, and
inducing him to snort cocaine. 'Fernando was a heavy consumer of cocaine,'
he alleges.
A police investigation was opened into Mr Farias yesterday on the
president's orders. A statement issued by the presidency said Mr Collor was
prepared to testify in court to the inquiry.
Although Pedro has yet to present any evidence to back his allegations,
there is no doubt of the damage they are causing to the government. Mr Luis
Inacio da Silva, leader of the Workers party and Mr Collor's rival for the
presidency in the 1989 polls, said: 'If even half the allegations are true,
the president should apologise to the Brazilian people and resign.'

FT  26 MAY 92 / Companies urged to audit interim financial statements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPANIES will be urged to obtain audits of their interim financial
statements instead of relying on a single annual audit in a wide-ranging
report on corporate governance due out tomorrow.
The recommendation is to be included in the final draft report from the
Committee on the Financial Aspects of Corporate Governance, the chairman of
which is Sir Adrian Cadbury.
The recommendation, like many others in the report, is likely to spark
controversy both from those who feel it goes too far and from those who
believe it does not go far enough.
While many of its recommendations deal with the presentation of accounts, it
will urge a number of reforms to board structures, including a larger role
for non-executive directors with specific obligations towards shareholders.
It will also press for greater disclosure of certain kinds of information
beyond the corporate accounts.
While no company need comply with its recommendations, the report will urge
the Stock Exchange to adopt a new listing requirement to force companies at
least to disclose the extent to which they comply with the Cadbury
Committee's recommendations.
Since Sir Andrew Hugh Smith, the Stock Exchange chairman, is a member of the
committee and was instrumental in its establishment, the rule is expected to
be adopted.
The evolution of the committee, launched last spring, has its roots in the
accountancy profession. Mr Michael Lickiss, former chairman of the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales, Sir Ron Dearing, chairman of
the Financial Reporting Council, and Sir Andrew Hugh Smith organised its
creation, galvanised partly by several well-publicised corporate collapses
which were nowhere reflected in their financial statements. The committee's
founders, therefore, felt the greatest reforms were needed in accountancy
and auditing procedures.
For instance, the committee's suggestion that interim statements be audited
comes as institutional investors are increasingly questioning the
reliability of corporate accounts between the audited periods. Earlier this
year, a call for the auditing of preliminary statements was issued by the
auditing committee of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and
Wales.
But Sir Ron said that, while the Cadbury Committee was being drawn up, its
founders realised that the structure of boards of directors and their
relationship with shareholders needed review as well.
The report is expected to include these recommendations:
Each board shall have separate audit and remuneration committees composed
entirely of non-executive directors - a move that could force all boards to
include at least two non-executives.
Performance-related pay elements of each director's remuneration shall be
disclosed.
Directors' terms of office should run for no more than three years.
Companies shall be required to make funds available to non-executive
directors wishing to get independent professional advice on certain
corporate matters.
Ways to make the annual general meeting a forum for small shareholders to
obtain information and voice their concerns.
Several of the recommendations are likely to disturb a large number of
directors. The investment company 3i, in a survey of finance directors at
some of the UK's largest companies, found that 82 per cent opposed giving
shareholders representation on remuneration committees, while 78 per cent
opposed their representation on audit committees. A number of the Cadbury
report's suggestions have been opposed by the Confederation of British
Industry.
However, the report is likely to fall short of what had been sought by the
more hawkish institutional investors, some of which have urged that
directors' remuneration packages and terms of office be disclosed annually
and that US-style accounting reports be introduced to help shareholders
learn more about the profitability of corporate subsidiaries. It is also
likely to fall short of what some Labour MPs had hoped for.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (7): Anxiety over power
project - Rokkasho / A village divided by nuclear strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL WEINBERG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
JAPANESE CHILDREN are taught from an early age that theirs is a country
without natural resources, which must make painful sacrifices to compensate.
This is also the thinking behind a drive by the nation's electric power
companies to build some of the world's most ambitious and controversial
nuclear power facilities in a corner of Aomori prefecture.
The Y1,260bn (Pounds 5.3bn) programme is located next to the village of
Rokkasho, near the north-east tip of Japan's main island of Honshu.
Given Tohoku's sparse population, the Rokkasho project is having a profound
economic impact, creating jobs, luring industry and stimulating demand for
services.
But environmental dangers have also caused severe anxiety among residents,
and spawned the region's largest political controversy of the decade. The
ruling Liberal Democrats came out in force to secure victory in last year's
Aomori prefecture gubernatorial race, after a series of embarrassing
election defeats by Rokkasho opponents.
On the positive side, construction alone will offer work to between 7,700
and 8,700 people, and the nuclear facilities will employ 2,500 people when
fully operative, according to the Federation of Electric Power Companies
(FEPC). It says the project has also attracted five companies to the region,
and that others will follow, including such big names as Sumitomo Electric
Industries, Mitsubishi Cable Industries and Hitachi Cable. About 1,000 jobs
already have been created, and another 3,000 will follow, the FEPC
estimates.
Mr Masaya Kitamura, governor of Aomori, terms the fuel cycle the
prefecture's most important undertaking. Over the 10 years required to build
the facility, Y730bn will flow from public works to prefectural companies,
he believes, while the creation of jobs will help relieve the constituency's
main problem.
The project has proceeded at what is lightning speed for the nuclear power
industry, since an 1984 agreement between the FEPC, Aomori prefecture and
Rokkasho village to go ahead with a uranium-enrichment factory, an
underground storage site for low-level radioactive waste and a plutonium
reprocessing facility.
Japan Nuclear Fuel Industries (JNFI), which was set up by the power industry
to help operate the site, reached a landmark in April with the official
start-up of the Y250bn uranium-reprocessing operation. Eventually it is
expected to supply about 30 per cent of Japan's nuclear fuel. The Y160bn
low-level radioactive waste site is scheduled to begin receiving deliveries
by the end of the year from the nation's grid of 42 nuclear reactors.
Ground-breaking for the Y850bn plutonium reprocessing plant, the greatest
focus of controversy, has been delayed for further safety studies. It is
likely to go ahead late this year or early next, with completion around the
turn of the century, says Mr Ryuji Mitsui, of JNFI.
The electric power industry aims to turn Rokkasho into the Mecca of Japan's
so-called nuclear fuel cycle, to achieve long-sought national energy
independence. Fast-breeder reactors, which theoretically are net producers
of plutonium, are the final critical link in the fuel-cycle, although other
leading nuclear nations have largely abandoned them as too expensive and
dangerous.
'We want people to understand the (electric power) industry's opinion that a
domestic source of nuclear fuel is necessary,' says Mr Terou Tokuine, of the
FEPC's nuclear fuel cycle site development department.
What most worries Aomori people, apart from the presence of plutonium, the
most toxic substance on earth, are plans to begin accepting high-level
nuclear waste, about 1997, from Japanese fuel reprocessed in the UK and
France. Critics say the risks of turning Rokkasho into a nuclear laboratory
and dump for the nation's radioactive garbage outweigh the economic
advantages, while most of the benefits are going to interests outside
Tohoku, such as large companies involved in the project.
Seven years into development of the nuclear site, Rokkasho village remains a
sleepy scattering of houses, stores and a town hall for the 11,000 people
who mostly make their living from farming and fishing.
The mayor, Mr Hiroshi Tsuchida, who says he always supported the nuclear
facility, concedes that the economic gains have been patchy. Families of
those involved in construction will continue to fare well for the next
decade, although the lives of other residents has have changed little.
'The biggest worry now are the plans to introduce high- level radioactive
material,' Mr Tsuchida adds.
The nuclear project is causing concern well beyond Rokkasho in a nation
where a nuclear allergy, resulting from wartime experience, and a pacifist
constitution are inconsistent with plans that could leave Japan with the
world's largest plutonium stockpile by early next century.
Mr Koji Asaishi, an Aomori lawyer, says he became an active opponent of the
Rokkasho project because of plans to introduce plutonium. 'I don't say don't
use nuclear energy, but they must first solve the downstream problem of
disposal,' he says.
According to Mr Asaishi, internal power industry documents leaked to
Rokkasho opponents also suggest that a major earthquake could result in
disaster. He adds that plans to store high-level radioactive material at
Rokkasho violate the original agreement, which gave short shrift to the
issue and said that any such storage would be 'temporary.'
Mr Asaishi says opposition is proceeding on three fronts: efforts to suspend
construction until further safety studies are completed; organisation of
citizens' groups against the facility; and opposition among political
leaders.
'If we don't continue, they will go on with even more dangerous
developments,' he says. 'The real problem is that Aomori citizens and the
people of Rokkasho can't check whether the operation is really safe or if
the facilities are necessary.'
Ironically, opposition within the nuclear power industry itself may prove
the anti-Rokkasho group's most potent ally. Doubts have arisen about the
expensive and complex fuel cycle initiative, given that the industry must
complete two 1,000MW light-water reactors annually over the next two decades
just to achieve existing goals.
Mr Takao Ishiwatari, director general of the Power Reactor and Nuclear Fuel
Development Corporation, suggested recently that safety and practicality may
require rethinking of fuel cycle plans.
For the Rokkasho area and greater Tohoku, failure to go ahead with the
multi-billion dollar plutonium facility could have far-reaching economic
implications. But if it is built, and then rendered useless by political or
other considerations, it could contaminate Rokkasho with an image as one of
history's white elephants.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (5): Academia's opportunity
 -Sendai is the region's hub and an aspiring centre of technology
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROFESSOR Jun-ichi Nishizawa, president of Tohoku University, is a famous
man in Sendai and is also something of a symbol of the aspirations of this
northern city, which serves as the administrative and economic centre of the
Tohoku region.
Prof Nishizawa founded the Semiconductor Research Institute in Sendai, and
conducted pioneering work on the growth of gallium arsenide crystals, which
are used by the electronics industry to make advanced semiconductor devices.
While the use of innovative technology developed on the campus in private
industry may be an ordinary affair in the UK or the US, it is decidedly
unusual in Japan, where academic research is vastly underfunded, where
genuinely creative scientific discoveries are rare, and where Ministry of
Education rules forbid professors to enter into private contracts with
industry.
It is one of the missions of Prof Nishizawa, a Sendai native whose father
also was on the Tohoku University faculty, to break down the barriers
between the academy and industry, to encourage Sendai's development into a
regional information centre, and to foster the development of new
industries.
It is a tall order, especially given the arcane government rules that seem
designed to make academic work as detached from the real world and
irrelevant as possible. But if any city in Japan has a chance to make this
dream come true, it is probably Sendai. It has some of the basic ingredients
that have led to the growth of technology centres in the west: an excellent
university and a pleasant environment, including nearby mountains and the
sea.
Sendai is an ancient city that was bombed flat during the war. But the city
that emerged from the ashes is surprisingly attractive by comparison with
the monsters that have grown up in central and western Japan. It could well
serve as a model for urban planning in Japan, were it not already too late
for most cities.
Sendai has wide boulevards lined with tall shady trees. It has covered
shopping arcades closed to traffic. If it is not architecturally inspiring,
at least it is not as screamingly ugly as much of the urban sprawl in Japan.
Indeed, much of the recent construction is pleasant in appearance. In spite
of its population of about 930,000, Sendai is one of the few cities in Japan
where it is possible to walk comfortably, without having to fight either
crowds or traffic.
It was fortunate, although perhaps only in retrospect, to have the luxury of
growing at a slower pace than the cities of the more heavily industrialised
centre. The mayor, Mr Toru Ishii, is still able to contemplate building a
series of concentric ring-roads around the city, to draw future development
away from the centre into satellites. Carrying out these plans was made
vastly easier when, in 1989, Sendai was merged with several smaller
neighbouring cities and designated as a major urban centre, giving the city
government greater administrative powers.
Sendai still has a long way to go before it attains a critical mass as a
leading technology centre; none the less, it is beginning to attract the
sort of industries that will help this to happen.
Motorola, the the US electronics group, for example, opened a semiconductor
assembly facility on the outskirts of the city last year, and is planning
eventually to install facilities to fabricate advanced semiconductor
devices. One attraction was obviously the Shinkansen express train umbilical
cord to Tokyo, less than a two-hour ride away. But Motorola's Sendai plant
is likely to grow increasingly independent of Tokyo.
Motorola was attracted to Sendai partly by the Ultra Clean Technology
Laboratory, connected to Tohoku University. The laboratory is developing
clean room devices that Motorola hopes eventually to use, and the company
has seconded one of its engineers to the laboratory full time to help in the
work.
Sendai airport has recently begun international flights to Seoul and
Singapore. Motorola is now re-routing some of its international shipments to
Asia away from congested Narita airport, which serves Tokyo, to Sendai. It
will increase these shipments after the airport has increased its customs
and freight handling capacity. The airport has been authorised to lengthen
its runway to 3,000 metres, which will open the possibility of direct
flights to Europe and the US.
In that case, Mr Takashi Kitagawa, director and general manager of
Motorola's semiconductor manufacturing, envisages US employees arriving in
Sendai and attending meetings on the same day, instead of making the
tiresome journey through Narita.
Perhaps the underlying ambition of Prof Nishizawa and mayor Ishii would be
to cut the umbilical cord to Tokyo altogether. This would plainly be
unrealistic, and in fact Mayor Ishii is hoping that Sendai may one day take
over selected government functions now located in Tokyo. Still, the goal of
making Sendai's development less dependent on Tokyo, and establishing itself
as a regional centre with strong direct ties to the outside world, looks
achievable.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (6): A home for research
institutes - Interview, Toru Ishii, mayor of Sendai
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TORU Ishii, Mayor of Sendai, came to office eight years ago, just after
the high-speed Shinkansen train was built, connecting Sendai to Tokyo.
The line opened the way for rapid growth of the city. Mr Ishii, a native of
Hokkaido, came to Sendai after a career in the ministry of home affairs. As
a graduate of Tokyo University law school, he is part of an elite that has
played a crucial role in the reconstruction of Japan. The following are
excepts from Steven Butler's interview with Mr Ishii.
Q: Sendai has made big efforts to attract high-technology investments to the
region. How successful do you think it is?
A: The industrial complex focusing on high-technology industry is located in
the very north of Sendai city, Izumi-ku. There, such companies as Tohoku
Semiconductor and another five or six companies are operating. However, as
the land price within the Sendai city is comparatively high, the surrounding
area of the city has become a focus for industry. In future, this kind of
investment is expected in the suburbs of Sendai City, rather than in the
centre of the city. Related to this is a Tohoku Intelligent Cosmos idea,
which is backed by the national universities of Tohoku region, together with
private companies and local government bodies. We are trying to establish
research institutes for development of new industrial technology.
In Sendai, we already have five institutes. We are making efforts to
establish new institutes or to invite national institutes from other region
to Sendai. And in future we would like to invite institutes and personnel
from overseas also. Through the promotion of activities by such institutes,
we can expect the relocation to Tohoku of various industries from new
fields.
Q: How long do you think you may have to wait for commercial results?
A: Perhaps we will have to wait 10 or 20 years.
Q: What do you think are Sendai's main attractions for investors?
A: Primarily, there is comparatively abundant technological know-how at
Tohoku University and elsewhere. We have a number of educational facilities
and universities here. As a result, we have technical specialists and human
resources.
In addition, transportation is becoming more convenient. We are expanding
Sendai port and airport. The runway of Sendai airport will be extended to
2,500 metres within this year, and to 3,000m within the next five years.
As for the Sendai port, we have started the operations to construct an
offshore pier at the existing port, so that we can accept overseas ships.
Now, both the Shinkansen (express train) and Tohoku Expressway extend to the
region. We are constructing another expressway along the seashore. Thus, the
transportation infrastructure is being developed gradually. So I think the
possibility of advanced technology industry moving into the region is very
high.
We do not necessarily expect new industries to establish factories in
Sendai, but in the whole Tohoku region. Then, for sure, Sendai wil come to
play a central role.
Q: What accounts for the recent industrial growth in Sendai?
A: Development of the existing industrial area of Japan, located in Tokyo
and to the west, has almost come to an end, and the region is excessively
crowded. So the conditions for the establishment of new factories are not
very good. Compared with this, Tohoku region is more advantageous from the
viewpoint of land availability, land price and labour supply. Until recent
years, transportation was a key constraint on the development. However, with
the gradual development of the basic infrastructure, such as the Shinkansen,
expressway networks, airport and ports, there appears more possibility for
companies to establish factories in the region.
(But) we do not want what happened in Tokyo and Osaka to happen in Sendai or
the Tohoku region. What we aim is to have more space and comfort. In a local
city like Sendai, we do not expect new factories within the city except
where we established an industrial complex many years ago. We want the new
industries to be located in the whole Tohoku region in a well-balanced way.
In Sendai, we want to develop the infrastructure in order to attract
research institutes or universities rather than to attract factories. Of
course, we are not placing restrictions on factories, but factories can be
established in places where conditions are far better.
Q: Is Sendai likely to become a second capital in Japan?
A: I think the sole concentration of capital functions in Tokyo must be
changed. If we could disperse various functions of Tokyo to local places it
would be welcomed. Sendai is a candidate as a second capital, or rather as a
city to receive part of Tokyo's capital function. However, I don't want
Sendai to be a city like Tokyo.
It is quite unrealistic and difficult to discuss (moving) the diet or the
government to other local cities. But ideas to move schools out of Tokyo or
to transfer research institutes and factories are much more realistic.
Q: What are the biggest issues facing Sendai?
A: One is the establishment of a comprehensive transportation system. That
is the primary thing. Three years ago, Sendai completed its subway network,
which goes from north to south of the city, and now we are planning to have
a subway network from east to west.
The second thing is the (plan) to construct five orbital roads. In most of
the cities of Japan, roads usually radiate from the centre of the city. As a
result, it leads to the concentration of people and functions in the centre
of the city. In connection with the orbital roads, we are planning
sub-cities in four different directions, where orbital roads and radiated
roads meet. One of the examples is the new business centre in Izumi-ku,
north of Sendai, from where the subway will start operation very soon.
As the population of Sendai is growing rapidly, we are putting emphasis on
the establishment of cultural facilities. We are discussing whether to
construct an art museum, and are researching whether to establish a large
concert hall. There is a general museum and a new science museum for
children, and cultural centres for youth already. I think the numbers of
libraries are not enough, so we are planning to have one library for each
ward. We are also making efforts to establish sports facilities and are
promoting a plan to construct a domed stadium so people can enjoy sports in
rain or snow.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (2): New routes to
investment - Manufacturing industries have made the economy more resilient
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR MANY years, Tohoku's greatest contribution to the Japanese economic
miracle was its people, who left the region in thousands to find work in the
industrial heartland of Japan, which stretches from Tokyo to Osaka.
Otherwise Tohoku was a scenic spot, rather difficult to get to, and filled
with farmers, fishermen and loggers.
Completion of the Shinkansen rail express to Sendai in 1982, and later to
Morioka, and the gradual expansion of the highway network, however, made
parts of Tohoku an attractive area for investment, particularly as the cost
of land rose sharply in the Kanto region while the supply of labour became
more constrained.
As a result, in the late 1980s, Tohoku enjoyed a surge of investment,
particularly in the semiconductor and electronics industries, which spread
south from Tokyo into Fukushima and Miyaga prefectures. Tohoku Electric
Power, the region's electric utility, claims that over 30 per cent of
Japan's high-technology production facilities are now located in Tohoku. The
trend is clear, and a wide range of well-known technology companies have
recently set up shop in the region, including NEC, Fujitsu, Nikon, Pioneer,
Sony, Hitachi, and Motorola.
These facilities, however, are still linked to the Tokyo region, and depend
on the fast train service to maintain their viability. The rest of the
region - Yamagata, Akita, Iwate, and Aomori - is relatively remote and less
industrialised.
The growth of manufacturing industries has nethertheless changed the
character of the regional economy, and made it more resilient.
Bimonthly surveys by the Economic Planning Agency show that Tohoku was one
of the last regions in Japan to succumb to the economic slowdown. It was not
until December that the EPA reported the first change in sentiment, six
months after the Kanto economy surrounding Tokyo began to slow. By February,
however, the slowdown in industrial output was comparable to the rest of the
nation, with a 5.1 per cent decline on the previous year, compared with a
4.6 per cent decline nationwide.
The late slowdown in manufacturing is believed to have resulted from the
relative newness and higher efficiency of Tokoku industrial plant. Companies
pulled the plug first on older plant elsewhere in the country. In other
respects, Tohoku looks relatively robust. It was the only region in the
country to report an increase in automobile sales last year, and the 5 per
cent decline in March sales, compared with a year ago, was much better than
the national average decline of 7.5 per cent.
The increase in bankruptcies is also well below the national average.
Companies elsewhere have been driven to the brink by the collapse in land
prices. Tohoku never suffered from rampant land speculation, and prices
remain firm.
Total investment in Tohoku has been brisk, having grown by 13 per cent in
the fiscal year to the end of March, compared with a nationwide expansion of
9.1 per cent. In the current fiscal year, the Japan Development Bank expects
investment to grow by 11.2 per cent, compared with a nationwide decline of
0.8 per cent. After stripping out special factors, however, the underlying
trends are not very different.
Much of the increase in Tohoku is accounted for by large and growing
investment in electricity generation, particularly the construction of
several nuclear reactors. In 1991, at Y799bn (Pounds 3.3bn), this accounted
for 44 per cent of all investment, and at Y959bn this year it is expected to
account for 47.5 per cent.
A 6.8 per cent decline in manufacturing investment last year was caused
mainly by a surge in investment in 1990 by Mitsubishi Paper Mills, which cut
back sharply in 1991, and is slashing investment again this year. This
year's projected decline in manufacturing investment of 0.2 per cent is much
better than an expected nationwide decline of 6.6 per cent, but the
relatively better performance in Tohoku again stems from the nuclear power
industry. Investment in the non-ferrous metals industries will grow by 60
per cent this year to Y167bn in an effort to prepare to meet orders from the
nuclear industry.
Investment in the electronics industry - the biggest area of manufacturing
investment for several years running - fell by 17.3 per cent last year and
is set to fall by 24 per cent this year to Y133bn, in line with declining
investment throughout the industry.
None the less, when the industry does pull out of its slump, Tohoku is
likely to be first in line to see a resurgence of spending. With land and
labour supply more favourable than in the rest of Japan, and with transport
improving steadily, it is fundamentally a more attractive place to invest.
This generalisation, however, does not apply to the entire region. The
economy in Aomori, for example, has slowed down sharply, from 4.4 per cent
growth in 1990 to 2.9 per cent last year - though this stems mainly from the
typhoon which last autumn blew up to half the apple crop to the ground.
'There is a very small connection to the rest of the Japanese economy,' says
Mr Kiyoei Kobayashi, deputy director general of planning at the Aomori
Prefectural Government. 'We have felt no impact of the collapse of the
bubble economy in Japan.'
Aomori and Akita, in particular, will have to wait for further improvements
in transport before they become better integrated with the rest of the
Japanese economy and fundamentally more attractive to industrial investors.
In the meantime, they can expect to benefit from increased infrastructural
investment and the growth of tourism.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (4): Residents rise to the
eagle - Development of tourism is meeting resistance on ecological grounds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALMOST EXACTLY two years ago, the residents of Tazawako, a town in the
mountains of Akita prefecture, were called to a meeting by the town mayor.
A plan was presented by the prefectural authorities and by JR East railway.
JR East was to purchase land from the town's people and build a resort with
hotels and lodges, ski slopes, an 18-hole golf course and a horse-riding
course. The project would help invigorate the local economy, they were told.
Mr Takeo Chiba, a resident of the town who runs a small catering business,
attended the meeting and, with his neighbours, asked a lot of questions: how
would the development affect the town's drinking water supply, or irrigation
water for its rice farmers? What would happen to the run-off of fertilisers
and poisonous weed-killers applied to the golf course? What would happen to
the animals, especially the nesting grounds for the golden eagle, an
endangered species?
'JR came to explain, but they couldn't answer our questions,' says Mr Chiba.
Today the project, part of a grand scheme to develop the area, is on ice,
pending completion of a three-year study of the habitat of the golden eagle.
Mr Chiba has formed an organisation, which 81 of the town's 120 families
have joined, and he is confident they can defeat the project.
The experience of Tazawako is in many ways a microcosm of the difficulties
surrounding the implementation of Japan's resort development promotion law,
which was enacted in 1987. Under the terms of the law, each prefecture has
selected one geographic area for development, with multiple resorts projects
totaling at least Y100bn (Pounds 419m) in value. Then the government helps
to foot the bill with subsidised financing.
The aims of the law are laudable enough: to promote local economic
development, and to provide much-needed leisure facilities for Japan's
overworked people. Yet, according to a recent survey by the Yomiuri Shimbun,
projects in over half of Japan's prefectures are in trouble because of
serious local opposition, sometimes on ecological grounds, or economic
difficulties, or both.
According to Mr Zeizo Kokubo, a consultant at the Japan Travel Bureau, the
large amount of money involved encouraged many prefectures to propose
unrealistic, grandiose projects, without conducting needed preliminary
studies.
JTB, for example, was called in after a plan had been proposed in Yamagata
Prefecture, and was asked to produce a study favourable for a project in the
areas of the ski resort at Zao mountain. Part of the plan, however, has been
halted by Yamagata City, because cutting more trees in the mountains would
threaten the city's water supply.
Mr Kokubo says the transport infrastructure is also insufficient to support
the project, and the financing ability of the companies involved too weak.
Indeed, he suspects that some local companies join the projects to speculate
in land, and have no real intent to develop and manage a resort.
Mr Kokubo blames, in part, the arbitrary manner in which resort areas are
selected - one per prefecture, although plans proposed by some local
governments do have a great deal of merit. He says, for example, that
projects proposed by Miyagi prefecture, in the Kurikoma-Funagata area, which
involve the usual combination of golf course and ski area, are more
realistic in part because Miyagi has a more highly developed transport
infrastructure.
Indeed, for the less developed, more remote areas of Tohoku, including
Akita, Aomori and Iwate, ease of transport from the Tokyo area can be what
makes or breaks a big project. One of Japan's largest and most elaborate ski
resorts, Appi, in Iwate prefecture, has been a great commercial success
because it lies a short distance from the last stop on the fast Shinkansen
'Bullet' train at Morioka. Appi was able to attract spring weekend skiers as
late as early May, long after resorts in central Japan had closed down.
Mr Kiyoei Kobayashi, deputy director general of planning at Aomori
prefecture, is for this reason longing for the completion of the Shinkansen
to Aomori. Although construction has started, the line may not be finished
until the turn of the century. Mr Kobayashi says that, after the line to
Morioka in Iwate was finished in 1983, resort and hotel investment in Iwate
blossomed and tourist arrivals doubled. During the same period, tourist
arrivals in Aomori rose by only 50 per cent.
Apart from the more grandiose golf-ski-hot springs trios under planning,
many more modest projects are under development that may be more appropriate
to local area needs, providing facilities for lower-cost, longer stay
holidays.
Mr Masao Hashimoto, head of Akita prefecture's resort promotion bureau,
boasts that next year Akita will open one of Japan's highest quality car
camp facilities. Given the enormous increase in sales of recreational
vehicles in Japan, the project looks almost guaranteed to be a success.
Likewise, Iwate, Akita and Aomori are all building villages of cottages in
scenic areas, with the aim of attracting families.
What Tohoku has in abundance still is relatively undeveloped mountains and
lakes of great natural beauty that, if exploited sensibly, could be a boon
the local economy. People such as Mr Chiba, of Tazawako, are not opposed to
development per se, but are against developments that will change the
character of their homes, and possibly threaten the environmental balance.
He says: 'The fact that the golden eagles live here means that this area is
environmentally very healthy. We want to preserve this.'

FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (3): The young leave the
land - Farm income has not kept up with the rest of the economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SENIOR official at the Akita prefecture federation of agricultural
co-operatives (JA) has no doubt about the greatest problem facing Akita
farmers:
'Ageing farmers cannot find successors to take over the business. If they
can't find successors agriculture will be destroyed,' he says.
Mr Susumu Inaba's logic is flawless. Although it is unlikely that large
stretches of Tohoku farmland will lie fallow for lack of farmers, the social
and economic structure surrounding agriculture in the north of Japan is
probably doomed.
The unwillingness of the children of farmers to stay and work the land is,
of course, merely a symptom of the deep economic difficulties facing
Japanese agriculture. Farm income has failed to keep up with the rest of the
economy, even though farm prices are often many times world levels.
Mr Hajime Sasaki, an organic vegetable farmer near Omagari, in Akita, says:
'The way farming has been going, I don't want my children to take over the
business.'
This is a startling admission in a farm society where emotional ties to the
land are sometimes nearly as deep as ties between family members. Mr Sasaki
simply worries that his children would be unable to earn a reasonable income
on the farm.
The problems facing agriculture in Tohoku are similar in character to those
found elsewhere in Japan, but Tohoku is also in some ways a special case,
because of the larger share of agriculture in the regional economy.
Agriculture, for example, accounts for about 16 per cent employment in
Tohoku, compared with 8 per cent nationwide. Primary industries in Tohoku
account for 5.5 per cent of the gross regional product, compared with 2.3
per cent for the nation.
Tohoku farms are larger than average - 1.61 hectares, compared with 1.37ha.
And farm families in Tohoku are more highly dependent on agricultural income
than their compatriots. Average income from agriculture in Tohoku was Y1.4m
(Pounds 5,864) per family in 1990, 23 per cent above the national average
for a farm family; but total income, including non-farm sources, came to
just Y6.08m, compared with a national average for farm families of Y6.6m.
This greater dependence on agriculture can hurt, as it did last year when
cold weather inflicted Y104bn of losses on the rice crop, and a severe
typhoon in Aomori prefecture blew ripened apples off trees, causing losses
of Y58.4bn.
And these are not young, resilient families able easily to absorb blows.
Tohoku's farmers are ageing rapidly, with 39 per cent of the workforce over
60, compared with 15 per cent over 60 in 1975.
Tohoku farmers are also far less commercialised than farmers elsewhere. The
dependence on rice for income declined from 55 per cent in 1975 to 45 per
cent in 1990 - but nationwide the average is 27.4 per cent of the value of
farm output.
In some senses, Tohoku is simply behind the rest of the nation. Farmers in
the west of Japan were quicker to reduce dependence on farm income, because
factory work was available practically on their doorstep.
Yet because of the slowness to change, Tohoku farmers are that much more
vulnerable to the vagaries of not just the weather, but of government farm
policy, particularly should the government give in to international pressure
and open Japan to rice imports, which are currently banned.
JA is waving the banner to keep trade barriers high, and the farmers
strongly support this. Yet beneath an uncompromising exterior, many farmers
have grown increasingly cynical about government policy, and are quietly
resigned to seeing the market opened.
Mr Takeshi Kuroda, a 46-year-old rice farmer in Akita, expects his business
to decline sharply when the market is opened. Yet this, he believes, will
eventually open opportunities for him to expand the size of his farmland
from the current 6.5ha, to increase the efficiency of his operation and
compete with imports on the basis of quality.
'I can lower my production costs, and Japanese people like Japanese rice
best,' he reasons.
Mr Koichi Yamazaki, director of the Tohoku Agriculture Bureau (the local
branch of the agriculture ministry), doubts whether Tohoku farmers could
every match US farmers in efficiency. But he does foresee a day eventually
when farm holdings would be consolidated to 30ha, allowing Japanese farmers
to match European efficiency.
But, he warns: 'It will be 10 to 20 years before the age structure is
stabilised.'
The process of social change in the countryside in the meantime promises to
be painful, as old people work the land long after they should retire, and
resist to the bitter end selling their family heritage.
Mr Yamazaki worries that liberalising the rice market prematurely would
accelerate the process of change, and cause even greater pain.
Mr Yamazaki is none the less optimistic that a younger generation of more
commercially-minded farmers will eventually go into the business. The
completion of the Tohoku Expressway in the last decade has cut by about
two-thirds, to eight hours, the time needed to truck vegetables from Aomori
to Tokyo. They can now be shipped overnight to Tokyo's wholesale markets,
thus vastly broadening the market for perishable cash crops.
Mr Yamazaki's office is helping about 300 young people a year to enter
farming, by finding available land.
Tohoku agriculture is facing a painful and unavoidable restructuring, but it
also plainly has a future.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Survey of Tohoku Region of Japan (1): Jobs needed to halt
exodus - The impact of industrial transformation in the south, which is
linked to Toyko by high-speed rail, is awaited in the more remote
prefectures
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1990, the population of Tohoku, Japan's north-east region, began to
increase again. This may sound like a mean accomplishment, but it symbolises
the fact that, after decades of sitting on the sidelines of the Japanese
economic miracle, Tohoku has finally joined in.
Two of the region's southern prefectures - Miyagi and Fukushima - have in
recent years received sufficient industrial investment, particularly in the
electronics industry, to offer high-quality jobs that encourage young people
to stay at home and attract others to return.
Gradually the impact of the industrial transformation of southern Tohoku,
which is linked to Toyko by the high-speed Shinkansen railway line, is
certain to spread to other prefectures in the region which are more remote
and isolated. It will not come too soon, because outside of Miyagi and
Fukushima, young people continue to leave by the thousands to seek a better
life elsewhere.
Tohoku is a vast mountainous region that contains some of Japan's most
beautiful and unspoilt scenery, and some of its richest farmland. It
accounts for nearly 18 per cent of the land area of Japan, but contains just
8 per cent of the population. In the winter cold, wet winds streak across
the sea of Japan from the Asian continent and dump piles of snow on the
mountains, which has allowed development of some of Japan's best ski
resorts. In the summer, Tohoku is spared the worst of the sultry weather
that can make life in the capital almost unbearable.
Sendai, the seat of Miyagi prefecture, is the region's administrative and
economic centre, and is rapidly developing direct air and telecommunications
links with the outside world. Government and academic leaders in Sendai are
trying to forge the six prefectures of the region (which for some purposes
also includes a seventh, Niigata) into an alliance for the co-ordinated
development of a network of high-technology research institutes. From
Sendai, also the site of Tohoku University, this looks a practical, if
long-term, way forward towards establishing the economic independence of
Tohoku from the rest of Japan.
Yet, for much of the region, this idea looks merely a distant dream. While
14.5 per cent of the working population of Miyagi is employed in primary
industry, mainly agriculture, nearly 25 per cent remain on the farm in
Aomori to the far north, where there is almost no manufacturing to speak of.
The key difference between the various prefectures is the relative
development of their transport infrastructure. The mountains that cover most
of the region have increased sharply the cost of building roads and
railways. Although the region is well served by a network of local trains,
high-speed train service is confined to a corridor linking Tokyo, Fukushima,
Sendai, and Morioka in Iwate prefecture, which was completed in 1982.
Yamagata was this month finally connected to the high-speed railway line by
means of a mini-Shinkansen, a high-speed train which runs on wide-gauge
tracks but with a narrower car that can pass through older tunnels.
Construction of a similar line to link Akita to the network has just begun
and should be finished by 1995. Construction of a full trunk line to Aomori
is also under way, although this may not be completed until the end of the
decade.
In the mean time, Akita and Aomori have been desperate to stem the outward
flow of young people.
'We want the young people to stay, but three to four thousand are leaving
every year,' says Mr Ken-ichi Sunouchi, deputy director-general of planning
at the Akita prefectural government. Akita's population peaked in 1960 at
1.35m, and has fallen to 1.23m today. Just over 16 per cent of the
population is now over 65 years old, and this is continuing to rise, causing
serious concern about the future viability of parts of the economy,
particularly agriculture.
Akita recently opened an office in Tokyo, and has compiled a list of many
thousands of Akita natives living in the capital region. After contacting
them, 1,600 have expressed a desire to return to Akita. The prefecture is
trying to help them, but the difficulty is finding a job in Akita
appropriate to the skill of an educated, experienced employee.
Aomori, similarly, is watching 12,000 of its young people leave each year,
fully half of the annual school leavers. Prefectural officials cite the lack
of appropriate jobs, poor salaries and a dearth of entertainment facilities.
Aomori, however, is likely to have to wait a long time before things improve
 -until the fast train can cut travel time to Tokyo from 5 1/2 hours to
four.
In some ways, it is surprising that companies have managed to find so few
opportunities to invest in the area, in spite of its relatively poor
transporation links. An outstanding exception to this pattern is TDK, the
world's largest manufacturer of magnetic tape and ferrite, which maintains
its principal manufacturing base in Nikaho, in the southern part of Akita
prefecture along the Japan Sea.
TDK was founded in 1935 by Mr Kenzo Saito, a local member of parliament, and
the company has based its growth principally on the Japanese discovery of
ferrite, a magnetic compound produced by a sintering process that is now
used in nearly all electronic appliances. TDK has remained in the area ever
since, even as it has gradually expanded to be a global manufacturer.
Its decision to stay, however, was not a act of charity. Mr Tokujiro Kudo,
general manager for the Akita district, admits that the business is somewhat
hampered by the distance from its principal customers in central Japan, the
higher cost of transport, and slightly higher electricity charges. He says,
however: 'The advantages of Akita far outweigh these higher costs.'
Akita offers cheap land and lower wage costs. TDK, as the biggest and most
sophisticated company in the area, also has its pick of the graduating
class. It has never had to cope with the severe shortage of labour that has
begun to afflict the central areas of Japan.
'All of Japan is suffering from a labour shortage,' says Mr Kudo. 'But TDK
has so many people who want to work here.' However, he also admits that
TDK's position in the region carries a big responsibility. The company, its
subsidiaries and suppliers employ about 14,500 people, over 10 per cent of
the area's population base, and TDK pays for 70 per cent of the Nikaho town
budget. Southern Akita probably has no room for another employer like TDK,
though it seems amazing that other sophisticated, international companies
have not found opportunities in the region.
Perhaps, over time, the relatively late development of the Tohoku region
will be seen as a blessing. Although Japan has coped remarkably well with
the intense overcrowding and concentrated industrial development in the
central Kanto and Kansai regions, these are becoming less and less
attractive places to live and work. Severe road congestion is chronic
everywhere, and ordinary salaried employees can no longer afford to buy a
home.
Tohoku, by comparison, faces the certain prospect of industrial growth at a
time when it is relatively unspoilt and prosperous. It can afford to think
about how to preserve an attractive living environment, rather than relegate
this to a secondary question after pushing for economic growth at the
highest possible speed.
This is not to suggest that achieving a balance between development and
environmental preservation will prove easy. Conflict between developers and
local residents concerned about damage to the environment will certainly
persist.
The greatest problem facing the region will be the human cost of the
transformation of agriculture, where the current farm system of small,
inefficient plots looks less and less viable as farmers age and cannot find
any successors to till the soil. This problem, faced everywhere in Japan,
will be all the more painful in Tohoku, because of the larger relative size
of the farm economy.
Nevertheless, the pain promises to be eased considerably if, as expected,
industrial investment continues at a fast pace, contributing to the further
prosperity of the region. Statistics from the ministry of international
trade and industry show that over a third of new high-technology factories
in Japan between 1978 and 1990 were built in Tohoku. As Japan's
manufacturing economy climbs out of its current recession, and as Tohoku's
transport infrastructure continues to improve, there is no reason why this
trend should not continue.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Michael Prowse on America: Lord, deliver us from deficits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL PROWSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It promises to be one of the strangest chapters in fiscal history. Next
month, a Democrat-dominated Congress is expected to back an amendment to the
constitution requiring a balanced federal budget. The White House has
already signalled its support. Ratification by the required three quarters
of state legislatures is not seen as problematic; most will probably be
eager to impose on Washington a restraint they have long endured. Believe it
or not, most experts predict that a balanced federal budget will be part of
the nation's highest law within five years.
This prospect is prompting a torrent of critical comment. The bipartisan
Congressional Budget Office has denounced the plans as a 'cruel hoax'. The
Washington Post says they are 'sloppy, dangerous . . . the ultimate
expression of the weakness and dithering . . . they purport to correct'. The
alarm has even spread to influential conservative organs. The Economist
opposes the amendment, arguing that it is merely a ruse to distract
attention from the failure to cut today's record deficit.
I find myself sympathising with members of Congress. It may be easier to
vote for a balanced budget in 1997 than to cut spending or raise taxes
today. Yet the sheer breadth of support for an amendment surely indicates a
remarkable shift in opinion. A reform once supported only by a fringe of
diehard conservatives is being championed by Senator Paul Simon, a prominent
left-leaning liberal Democrat, and many others on the left of centre. What
is going on?
The answer is that years of criticism of deficits has had an effect. The
intellectual battle is won. Most members of Congress are now convinced that
persistent deficits do harm: the long-term impact on national savings and
hence on investment, productivity and growth is better understood than in
the 1980s. At the same time, big deficits are widely denounced as an immoral
charge on future generations and, increasingly, as a source of inequality
today: the federal government pays more in interest to wealthy bondholders
than it spends on programmes for the disadvantaged. But politicians also
know - better than their critics - that the peculiar character of American
politics makes responsible action desperately hard to achieve, especially
when the parties share control of Congress and the White House.
Many of the arguments against a constitutional amendment are spurious.
People say that the states regularly flout their balanced budget
requirements. They may cheat a little, but their fiscal performance is
impressive by federal standards. Most do take tough action when necessary.
This has not been true for decades in Washington. The federal government has
achieved a surplus in only one year since Dwight Eisenhower's presidency. In
the past 12 years, the national debt has mushroomed from Dollars 1,000bn to
Dollars 4,000bn.
A more serious objection is that the federal government needs fiscal
flexibility because its job is to balance the national economy, rather than
its own books. Economists offer two ripostes. The new-classical school says
fiscal fine-tuning is impossible because movements in private saving offset
the effect of government actions. The experience of the 1980s, when both
public and private saving fell sharply, has largely refuted this piece of
wishful thinking. But a second objection to fiscal demand management stands:
by the time politicians have agreed how to respond to a recession, and
passed the necessary legislation, the economy is usually on the mend. The
practical significance of reduced fiscal flexibility may thus be limited.
It would depend, in any case, on the exact phrasing of a balanced budget
amendment. There is no reason in principle to seek balance over a single
year: a requirement for balance over a three or five year period would be
perfectly feasible. This would allow the 'automatic stabilisers' - falling
taxes and rising benefit payments - to cushion demand during recessions.
Under current proposals, a three-fifths majority of both houses could
override the balanced budget rule; such majorities would be forthcoming if
the US faced a 1930s-style depression. The much-vaunted freedom under
existing rules has anyway proved illusory: the federal government borrowed
so much during the 1980s that it was unable to take action to mitigate the
recession.
The long-run drain on savings from persistent deficits is a far more serious
threat than any temporary loss of fiscal flexibility. Yet the fragmentation
of political accountability under the US system focuses attention on the
short run. This provides a prima facie case for a constitutional amendment -
for rules that force Washington to adopt longer fiscal time horizons. After
the disappointments of the Gramm-Rudman legislation in the 1980s, the tough
question is whether it would work.
Don't be too cynical. The passing of a constitutional amendment is not the
same as ordinary legislation. At the very least, it would demonstrate broad
national support for fiscal restraint and increase the pressure on Congress
and White House to make painful decisions in coming years. At best, it might
radically alter the conduct of fiscal policy. An appeal to constitutional
authority is the modern equivalent of primitive tribe's prayer for
deliverance. Prayers are sometimes answered.

FT  26 MAY 92 / The FT Interview: Profit is music to his ears - Alain Levy,
chief executive of PolyGram, speaks to Michael Skapinker
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL SKAPINKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For a journalist reared on Janis Joplin and Simon and Garfunkel, contact
with the music industry can be dispiriting. If the head of a chemical or
electronics company mentions an utterly unfamiliar product, you can ask what
it is or look it up.
But when Alain Levy, French-born chief executive of the music giant
PolyGram, announces that his most promising acts are such mysterious names
as PM Dawn, Black Sheep, Ce Ce Peniston and Ugly Kid Joe, you have to accept
that you are getting old.
Some of Levy's sober-suited music industry colleagues look as if they could
be running chemical or electronics companies, which makes their
pronouncements on the latest US rap act seem all the more incongruous. Levy
at least looks as if he belongs in a creative business. Although his
expansive office in London's Berkeley Square befits his status as one of the
most powerful figures in the music industry, his tousled hair and anarchic
grin give him a passing resemblance to Harpo Marx.
But even Levy, who is 45, says some of his company's new albums are lost on
him. 'It's a bit distressing. More and more I'm saying, 'I don't understand
it'. Some of it I really don't. I don't get the magic of the album, which is
a bit sad.'
Levy does spend time with the company's artists. 'You have to make sure they
know they're important to you. The pitfall is that once they have access to
the president, they don't want to talk to anybody else in the company.'
Record industry executives, he says, should not get too wrapped up in the
music. 'The position I'm in can be pretty tempting. Artists call you up, say
'come to the studio', and soon you think you're an expert in mixing records,
when you're an expert at nothing.'
Levy's job is to make profits for PolyGram, one of the few thriving
subsidiaries of Philips, the Dutch electronics group. In March, in the midst
of recession in important markets such as the US and Britain, PolyGram's net
profits were up 24.8 per cent to Fl446m (Pounds 135m).
Levy also announced that PolyGram was the biggest music company in the
world, along with Time Warner of the US. The two companies have since been
joined at the top by Thorn EMI of the UK which recently bought Richard
Branson's Virgin Music, the last of the large independent labels. The three
companies have a worldwide market share of about 18 per cent each.
PolyGram itself expanded its market share by buying Island Records in 1989
and A&amp;M Records in 1990. The reason the large groups have snapped up the
smaller labels, Levy says, is that music is now a worldwide business. In the
old days, record companies could make most of their money in the US. Today,
the US typically accounts for no more than 30-35 per cent of sales of an
album. Modern music companies need their large size to ensure international
distribution of their releases.
Does this mean people the world over now have the same musical tastes? No,
says Levy. The stars with a global following account for about 60 per cent
of the international music market. But companies cannot afford to ignore the
rest of the market, which is made up of indigenous musical acts.
'Basically the Japanese market is very Japanese. The international
repertoire there is the luxury of college kids. In Europe, I strongly
believe that the more you talk about European integration, the more,
culturally, people need to go back to their roots. Everybody was saying
German repertoire was dead; now German repertoire is taking an increasing
share in Germany.
'There are some key words which don't sound the same in English as they do
in local languages and that won't change - 'love' is one. Plus, don't forget
a lot of people don't understand English.'
The absorption of small record labels by big music companies is only one
example of consolidation in the industry. The other is the acquisition of
the music companies themselves by large consumer electronics groups. Sony of
Japan bought CBS, the US record company, in 1988. Matsushita of Japan bought
MCA of the US in 1990.
PolyGram, whose connection with Philips goes back decades, is the oldest
example of this link between manufacturers of consumer electronic 'hardware'
and the producers of music or 'software'. There are strong management ties
between the two companies. Levy sits on the Philips executive board. Jan
Timmer, Philips' president, is a former head of PolyGram. It was Timmer who
in 1984 recruited Levy, then with CBS, to run PolyGram's French operation.
Philips and PolyGram have the advantage of both being European companies.
Co-operation between Japanese electronics companies and US music groups is
proving more difficult. Apart from the differences in corporate culture
between electronics and music businesses, there are national differences.
'It's a double cultural whammy,' Levy says. 'For the Japanese, the
individual is not important, it's the team. In a creative business, it's
exactly the opposite. Megalomania is almost elevated to a virtue in our
business.'
Although the Japanese electronics groups have had difficulty realising the
supposed 'synergies' between electronic hardware and software, Levy insists
the benefits exist.
For the hardware companies, the margins available in the software business
are a considerable attraction, Levy says. It is difficult for the
manufacturers of compact disc players and cassette recorders to realise
large profits. The expense of developing a new technology, such as the
compact disc, is huge, and the selling price of CD players has plummeted
since their launch in the mid-1980s. By contrast, the price of discs has
remained high.
'For the software companies, the benefit is an intangible but very important
one, which is to think about your business in strategic terms, about how our
music is going to be distributed in the next five to 10 years,' Levy says.
From this autumn, some of PolyGram's music will be played on a new type of
machine called the Digital Compact Cassette (DCC). The DCC player, invented
by Philips, plays conventional cassette tapes. It also plays digitally
recorded tapes which have a sound similar to that of compact discs. Philips
and PolyGram collaborated on the development of DCC, although Philips was
careful to line up other music companies behind the technology as well. But,
Levy says, if PolyGram had advised against the launch of DCC, Philips would
probably have abandoned the project. The music company serves as a market
research organisation for the hardware manufacturer, telling it what will
and will not be acceptable to the record industry.
Had Sony owned CBS at the time, Levy believes, it would have known that the
music companies were not prepared to co-operate in the introduction of
Digital Audio Tape (Dat), an earlier CD-quality cassette player which failed
to take off as a consumer product.
Sony is about to launch a new product - a miniaturised CD which is capable
of recording as well. The appearance of full-sized blank, recordable CDs is
likely within the next few years.
The progress of digital recording worries many in the music industry. They
are not simply concerned about people making home copies of friends' CDs.
They fear that consumers will have no need for pre-recorded CDs at all. With
the parallel progress of digital broadcasting technology, they worry that
people will record their music directly on to blank CDs from subscription
satellite and cable channels  - an 'international juke box'.
Levy is not concerned about younger music fans who will still, he says, want
to browse through record shops. The international juke box might, however,
be more attractive to members of the rock 'n' roll generation who are now in
their 40s.
'We're starting to see, especially in the US, people going to concerts who
do not buy the record - which is a fairly new phenomenon. The concert hall
will be packed but it doesn't affect new record sales. Obviously, we don't
know how to offer the records to these people; if they could spend Dollars
25 on the ticket they could spend Dollars 12 on the record. They don't do
it.'
Levy says the music industry has nothing to fear from this group recording
their music from subscription services. 'It might be a plus for us. It might
reduce private copying and make it less cumbersome if, for Dollars 2 or
Dollars 3, you can get a perfect copy at home, legally.'

FT  26 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges and Money Markets: A resistible rise
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ALTHOUGH the US dollar's slide against the D-Mark appeared to be bottoming
out at the end of last week, traders are still looking for positive signs of
a US economic recovery before they invest further in the currency, writes
James Blitz.
The Federal Reserve's decision not to signal a cut in interest rates last
Wednesday gave the dollar a new surge of strength on the foreign exchange
markets, up to around DM1.6135 in light trading yesterday.
The dollar could rise further if the conference board's consumer confidence
index, which is due out today, proves as good as the market expects. The
April figure was sharply up to 64.8, and the market is predicting another
increase for May, up to 66.0. Tomorrow's figure for April's durable goods
orders will also affect the currency, with the market expecting a 0.5 per
cent rise. The revision of first quarter GDP is due out on Friday.
Germany's economic numbers will be scrutinised no less carefully, as the
markets seek confirmation that another rise in the emergency Lombard rate is
out of the question.
Last Friday's better-than-expected figure for April money supply, which came
in at 8.8 per cent, dashed expectations of another rate rise. The
provisional cost of living figures for May, which should be out tomorrow,
will give some indication of whether inflation is fully under control. The
market expects to see a 0.3 per cent monthly rise.
Sterling investors will focus carefully on today's figure for the UK trade
balance in April, which analysts expect to be in the red to the tune of
Pounds 0.9bn. UK analysts fear that the trade balance may widen as Britain's
economy grows, and that this may hinder the pound's strength in the long
term.

FT  26 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Manila soars on renewal of confidence -
The market has hit record levels following the peaceful elections
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOSE GALANG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The Philippines has been struck by a renewal of economic optimism following
the recent, largely peaceful presidential election campaign.
Hopes of economic recovery have boosted sentiment among investors and led to
the stock market recording consecutive record levels over the past few days.
Yesterday the composite index closed up 3.8 per cent at an all-time high of
1,432.
Investor optimism was encouraged by the fact the election took place without
scenes of violence or widespread electoral fraud which had characterised
previous polls, some analysts said.
Now, after several years of constant coup threats, the prospect of a
peaceful transfer of power has encouraged the business community to dust off
investment plans which had been shelved.
The new president will be known in two or three weeks after an official
counting of the votes by Congress. However, an unofficial tabulation shows
Mr Fidel Ramos, the administration-backed candidate, leading by a margin of
more than 1m votes.
The general sentiment in the business community is that Mr Ramos, a former
defence secretary, is capable to providing the firm leadership that will
inject much-needed stability into government. He is expected to follow
mainly pro-business policy directions.
Independent economists are projecting that the economy could grow by up to 3
per cent this year, after zero growth last year. Interest rates, already
down from early-1991 highs, are seen declining further, a result mainly of
tight control on government spending during the election campaign period.
Yields on Treasury bills now hover around 15 per cent, compared to 20 per
cent in January. The exchange rate continues to be stable, in spite of calls
from exporters for the monetary authorities to allow a slight drop.
These factors have lured new money into the stock market. In the week
following the election, turnover on the Manila and Makati exchanges averaged
310m pesos a day compared with an average daily turnover of 155m pesos a day
throughout 1991. Brokers say that the bulk of the trading is accounted for
by local investors. This is still in step with trends in previous years when
foreign funds were only attracted after seeing turnover expand with local
interest.
Anscor Hagedorn Securities told its clients last week that the election
could lead to 'some funds being shifted from the region and into the
Philippines'. The brokerage house said that this was due to the recent
political turmoil in Thailand and the 'political transition' in Indonesia
where elections are due next month.
The best performer among the most active issues since election day has been
Philippine Long Distance Telephone, which has shown considerable strength in
New York where it is also listed. PLDT is currently trading at an all-time
high of 1,120 pesos, for a ratio of 10.2 times its projected 1992 earnings.
Its prevailing price also represents an increase of 33 per cent from its
level at the start of the year. Analysts forecast PLDT profits to rise by
only about 5-6 per cent in the current year, compared to 48 per cent in
1991.
The big capital requirements of its expansion programme could lead to the
entry of foreign equity from American Telephone and Telegraph, which has
been rumoured since last year.
Some of the traditional market favourites, such as Ayala Corporation and its
property subsidiary Ayala Land, San Miguel Corp, and Philippine National
Bank, have posted 'modest' increases so far. This has prompted analysts to
tick them off as top candidates for a new market takeoff.
Meanwhile, the proposed merger of the Manila and Makati stock exchanges
continues. The Securities and Exchange Commission has been trying to forge a
merger of the two exchanges since 1990 but little progress has been made
owing to differences in culture between the institutions.
A merger, nonetheless, is widely viewed as a major step in promoting further
development of the local capital market. Foreign financial assistance,
particularly from the Asian Development Bank, is being made available for
the unification if it goes ahead.

FT  26 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Hong Kong and Bangkok
outpace Nikkei rise
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices were supported by index-linked and small-lot buying on the back
of a stronger yen and firm bond prices, and the Nikkei average gained 1.8
per cent, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed up 334.00 at the day's high of 18,555.00, remaining in
positive territory after opening at the day's low of 18,221.70, and surging
in the late afternoon on arbitrage-related buying.
Volume fell to 180m shares from 242m. Most large-lot investors remained
sidelined due to corporate earnings announcements, and dealers, who have
been active recently, refrained from trading in the final week of May
trading.
Advances led declines by 566 to 389, with 178 unchanged. The Topix index of
all first section stocks rose 12 to 1,383.70.
The absence of foreign investors due to the long weekend contributed to the
low volume.
Mr Masami Okuma, at UBS Phillips &amp; Drew, said the current spate of personnel
changes at Japanese financial institutions and companies was another factor
in the low turnover equation.
Speculative favourites dominated activity. Tsugami, a medium sized machine
tool maker, was the most active issue of the day, advancing Y15 to Y755.
Morinaga Milk Industry, rose Y17 to Y852.
Bank shares were sought on short covering. Industrial Bank of Japan gained
Y10 to Y1,800 and Dai-Ichi Kangyo Bank advanced Y10 to Y1,410.
Transport companies were sought on brisk earnings results. Kawaski Kisen,
the shipping company, rose Y14 to Y395 and Nippon Express, the parcel
delivery company, gained Y24 to Y665.
Nippon Formula Feed, the farm feed maker, gained Y14 to Y575 as it advanced
for the third straight day. Investors have been encouraged by the company's
plans to start cultivating the endangered blue-fin tuna. Forecasts that the
company's pre-tax profits for the current year to March 1993 will rise by 70
per cent also buoyed interest.
Chiyoda, the plant engineering company, rose Y80 to Y1,700 on the company's
forecast of a 30 per cent rise in pre-tax profits to Y10bn for the current
year to next March. The company is also promoted as a environmental-related
stock.
In Osaka, the OSE average gained 65.07 to 20,956.48 in volume of 9m shares.
Speculative issues gained amid low volume. Ono Pharmaceutical advanced Y70
to Y6,120.
Roundup
A MONETARY initiative in Hong Kong and political change in Bangkok took
these markets, with Manila, ahead faster and more enthusiastically than
Tokyo yesterday.
HONG KONG shot up to register its second all-time high in three sessions,
boosted by Friday's unexpectedly large interest rate cut and a huge influx
of overseas funds.
The Hang Seng index closed 133.43, or 2.2 per cent higher at 5,993.11,
breaking the 6,000 barrier in the morning to hit an intraday high of
6,032.10 soon after the opening, but easing back on profit-taking
thereafter.
Turnover was also a record, at HKDollars 6.4bn against HKDollars 4.6bn last
Friday.
BANGKOK responded enthusiastically to the resignation of Prime Minister
Suchinda Kraprayoon, the SET index climbing 23.91, or 3.3 per cent to 742.42
in active turnover of Bt5.98bn.
After the close, an amendment reducing the military's power in Thailand's
parliament won initial approval yesterday as legislators began a democratic
overhaul of the constitution.
AUSTRALIA traded in a narrow band and in thin turnover, subdued by the UK
and US holidays later yesterday. The All Ordinaries index fell 0.4 to
1,684.1 in turnover down from ADollars 214m to ADollars 143m.
NEW ZEALAND, similarly, saw the NZSE-40 index up 2.27 to 1,554.04 in
turnover down from NZDollars 25.7m to NZDollars 20.9m.
Bank of New Zealand was one of only three stocks to exceed volume of 1m
shares as it rose 2 cents to 78 cents in 1.1m. units. BNZ is expected to
produce improved results after the close today.
SEOUL's composite index fell 4.37 to 571.40 in lacklustre trading, weakened
by doubts about any government initiative to bail out financially troubled
investment trust houses.

FT  26 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Allianz lifts Germany in dull
European trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ABSENCE of UK and US investors was expected to quieten bourses
yesterday, and in most cases this happened. However, an outstanding UK order
for Allianz, the German insurer, was credited with bringing the Frankfurt
market round from an early loss to close at a new 21-month high, writes Our
Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT slid early in session, but selling pressure fell away as the
Allianz order took the insurer's shares up DM30.50, dragging other blue
chips and the 30-share DAX index up along with it.
After a 2.98 rise to 725.01 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX closed
8.61 better at 1,811.57. Mr Hans-Peter Wodniok of James Capel in Frankfurt
reckoned that without the foreign holidays, the German market would have
maintained a faster climb.
As it was, a number of internationals were held back, Deutsche Bank rising
by only DM1.40 to DM715 - going ex-dividend last Friday did not help -
Daimler by just DM1 to DM813 and the big three chemicals stocks all posting
small declines.
On the credit side, Commerzbank added DM4.60 to DM273.30 on favourable
comment in a German Sunday newspaper, Volkswagen came back from
profit-taking to rise DM4.60 to DM408.60 and Continental, the tyremaker, put
on DM4.80 to DM277.50 on a magazine report that the state of Lower Saxony
had put together a friendly buying team to take over the interests of
Pirelli SpA, Conti's former suitor, and its friends.
MILAN was politically motivated all day, nervous in the morning after the
murder at the weekend of the Mafia-fighting judge, Mr Giovanni Falcone, but
lifted by a late rally on signs of a breakthrough in Italy's political
impasse over the choice of a new president.
The MIB index closed 0.3 per cent higher at 978. Holding companies took the
share price limelight, Cir rising L34 to L1,789, Ferruzzi Finanziaria by L49
to L1,821 and Ifi by L415 to L13,425.
PARIS finished barely changed in dull trade. The CAC-40 index gained 1.13 to
2,046.25 in turnover of some FFr1.3bn. Oil stocks were one of the day's
features following the Opec agreement on Friday. Elf rose FFr2.90 to
FFr396.90 while Total added FFr2.50 to FFr262.50.
LVMH rose FFr7 to FFr4,195 after noting that although recovery had been
tardy in coming to Europe the slowdown in Japan, an important market for the
luxury goods group, was likely to be of limited duration.
ZURICH ended a touch firmer, with the all-share SPI index rising 4.5 to
1,203.0. Certificates in the pharmaceutical group, Roche, topped the active
list as they rose SFr50 to SFr3,410.
AMSTERDAM saw limited interest as the CBS Tendency index rose 0.6 to 131.0.
There was scattered buying of some blue chip stocks including Royal Dutch,
which rose Fl 1.90 to Fl 154.40 following the Opec outcome last week.
Elsevier's recent strong rally continued, up Fl 1.40 at Fl 115.20. Buehrmann
Tetterode was also active on buy notes, closing up Fl 1.00 at Fl 53.50.
BRUSSELS ended slightly lower in thin trading. The Bel-20 Index shed 0.41 to
1,215.27 in turnover of BFr644m. Electrabel eased BFr25 to BFr4,600 in
volume of 42,850 shares while Delhaize lost BFr50 to BFr9,000. Elsewhere,
Petrofina fell BFr25 to BFr10,850.
COPENHAGEN was dominated by Hafnia which announced a three-for-two rights
issue at DKr105 a share. The insurer's B shares lost DKr9 to DKr160 in low
volume. The all share index closed up 0.45 to 336.80.
ISTANBUL closed at a six-month low on renewed concern about a fresh round of
interest rate rises. The index shed 176.44 or more than 5 per cent to
3,310.29 in turnover of TL115bn from TL128bn.
VIENNA closed firmer in light volume. The ATX index gained 6.47 to 984.79.
OMV rose Sch6 to Sch898 after reporting better-than-expected first quarter
results.
MADRID's general index ended down 1.06 at 258.70.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Economics: Markets seek inspiration from UK trade figures
and new US activity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN A week shortened by public holidays in much of the industrialised world,
markets will be seeking inspiration from the April UK trade figures today
and later from new US activity and confidence data and preliminary cost of
living figures for May from Germany and some of its western Lander.
The Pounds 575m UK current account deficit in March was the best so far this
year and markets will be waiting to see if this performance was maintained
in April. Interest has mainly focused on the implications of the figures for
the domestic UK economy. Imports performed better than exports in the first
quarter and this trend, if continued, could reinforce signs of economic
recovery in the UK.
Given the uncertainties about the US recovery, today's Conference Board
consumer confidence index and Friday's Chicago purchasing managers' index
are likely to command more attention than the preliminary first quarter GDP
figures, also due on Friday. The German preliminary cost of living figures
are likely to show no fall in headline inflation and therefore offer no
encouragement to hopes of lower German interest rates.
Highlights of the week ahead, with the median of forecasts in brackets from
MMS International, the financial information company, include:
Today: UK, Current account balance of payments (Pounds 600m deficit) and
trade figures for April (Pounds 900m deficit). US, Conference Board consumer
confidence index for May (67 per cent), domestic car sales to May 11-20
(6m), Presidential primaries in Arkansas, Idaho and Kentucky. France, first
quarter GDP (up 0.4 per cent on year). Japan, March personal income,
consumption expenditure, April retail sales (up 0.9 per cent on year).
Australia, April vehicle registrations (down seasonally adjusted 2.5 per
cent), manufacturing production statistics. Canada, March department store
sales (down 3.5 per cent on month), employment earnings (up 4 per cent on
year).
Tomorrow: Germany, cross party talks on the economy. UK, April building
society net new commitments (Pounds 3.5bn), provisional new construction
orders for March. US, April durable goods orders (up 0.7 per cent),
shipments. Japan, April industrial production (down seasonally adjusted 1
per cent). Canada, April industrial product price index (up 0.2 per cent).
France, April trade balance (FFr300m deficit).
Thursday: Ascension Day: markets closed in Austria, Belgium, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Netherlands, Sweden and Switzerland. Spain, 24
hour general strike expected in most regions. US, April import, export price
indices, Money supply for week ended May 18. UK, April new vehicle
registrations. Australia, first quarter average weekly earnings (up 1 per
cent on quarter).
Friday: US, first quarter preliminary GDP (up 2.6 per cent), Q1 GDP deflator
(3.1 per cent), Q1 after-tax corporate profits, May Chicago purchasing
managers index, agriculture prices, April bank credit, commercial and
industrial loans. Japan, Tokyo May consumer price index (up 2.6 per cent on
year), Japan April CPI (up 2.5 per cent on year), housing starts (up 0.3 per
cent on year). construction orders, construction starts, unemployment rate.
During the week: Germany, May preliminary cost of living (up 0.3 per cent on
month, 4.5 per cent on year), April import prices (up 0.1 per cent on month,
down 2.4 per cent on year). Italy, April trade (L1.8 trillion deficit), May
CPI in major cities (up 5.6 per cent on year).

Results due
A FIRST profit contribution from the US should help Body Shop International,
the eco-friendly retailer of beauty products, to a 25 per cent-plus increase
in pre-tax profits. A figure of Pounds 25m to Pounds 26m is expected when
the full-year results are announced tomorrow. With UK growth limited by
recession, the turnround in the relatively new US chain will be a critical
factor alongside continued progress on the continent.
Carlton Communications, the television and television services group, is
expected to announce a modest increase in interim pre-tax profits tomorrow.
Analysts are predicting around Pounds 48m, which suggests Carlton has still
been suffering from recession. The Pounds 46.3m figure last year was nearly
30 per cent down on 1990.
When MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, reports its interim
results on Thursday, attention will focus on its development programme,
which is the largest in the sector. Analysts will be keen to hear of any
progress in letting Alban Gate, the largely-empty office block straddling
London Wall in the City.
The pre-tax profits for the half year to March 1992 are expected to be
around Pounds 63m, down from Pounds 67.4m a year ago. Although the rental
income is likely to rise, this will be offset by an increase in financing
costs as the company reduces the proportion of capitalised interest
associated with development properties.
On the same day, Thorn EMI is expected to report annual pre-tax profits
slightly down from last time's Pounds 258.6m to about Pounds 255m, although
they could fall as low as Pounds 240m.
Recent acquisitions - the half of Chrysalis Records which Thorn did not
already own, Remco America, and Virgin Music Group - will probably have
boosted the pre-tax line, though earnings are likely to be down around 10
per cent.

FT  26 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: When gentlemen prefer bonds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY HARRIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
No, this isn't another expression of support for Norwich Union. It is an
examination of the Cobbold project to merge the pound and the French franc.
It is not very likely to happen, but it does raise some interesting
questions (one of them which concerns gentlemen and bonds).
The Cobbold of the project is not the former Governor of the Bank of
England, who would surely have hated it; in 1955, when another European
monetary venture was being floated, he warned R. A. Butler against getting
'tied up to something very like Gold Standard practice'. It comes from his
son David, the present Lord Cobbold, who runs his own currency specialist
firm. The idea is ostensibly to start monetary union somewhere, now, and no
doubt to dish the Bundesbank too.
There is a suspicious numerical neatness to the thing: with a minimal
effort, as Cobbold likes to point out, we could merge at Fr10 to the pound;
we could call our florin a franc, and they could call Fr10 un livre. Well,
yes; and the number of my house is a perfect square, as it happens. But the
idea does have some serious merits.
It's politically neat: both our prime ministers are strong currency men, and
impatient with German constraints on recovery. It would involve an
independent central bank which would have appealed strongly to the first
Lord Cobbold, and would be good for credibility. Above all, our pooled
currencies and pooled reserves would be impressively large, and might free
us from the need to follow monetary policies devised in Frankfurt.
In short, we could cut interest rates (if we could persuade our newly
liberated central bankers to agree). It may be a sidetrack on the road to a
European money, if you happen to believe that we will ever arrive there; but
it could still be, as Senator Warren Rudman claimed for his US
budget-balancing bill, 'a bad idea whose time has come'.
But would it work? Not if you accept the fashionable theory that short-term
interest rates are simply a function of exchange rate expectations; but this
theory, again, seems to me a good deal too neat for its own good. It
overlooks a couple of significant facts.
First, there wasn't a sterling crisis in the weeks before the British
general election. This must effect expectations; according to the theory,
interest rates should have moved sharply. They didn't. And this is not just
a special case. European money rates, having converged strongly, are now
becoming de-coupled, as some alert brokers have remarked. This could, of
course, reflect nothing but growing doubts about the EMU project; but in my
experience, dealers give little thought to such distant matters. In any
case, the drift can be explained purely from market facts.
Consider the dollar: US short rates, thanks to the Fed, are absurdly out of
line, but bond rates are quite comparable with ours. Then note the recent
behaviour of the currency markets. They used to defy the central banks to
resist market forces; now they respond tamely to any official hint. Dealers
behave differently because their orders have changed. The banks used to
employ them to play the markets; now they are risk-averse, and insist that
exposures must be cleared by closing time. This reduces liquidity, and so
enables short-term rates to decouple.
The gentlemen who run pension funds, investment trusts and the like are by
contrast immune to this epidemic of fright. On the contrary, they buy
foreign securities in the name of safety, to spread their risks; and what
they like, when equities look a bit too demanding, as on Wall Street, or
accident-prone, as in Tokyo, is bonds, which have a predictable return and
huge liquidity. So though hot money has cooled, investment funds continue to
flow. Bond rates are likely to stay in step - to the distress of the Fed,
which cannot get investment going despite ever lower money rates.
So Cobbold's Franc Sterling might well float quite securely to lower short
rates. We might even be able to go it alone. Pity it won't happen.

FT  26 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Lower-rated borrowers turn to Yankee
sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE YANKEE bond market
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
the US bond market for foreign issuers - is proving an important source of
funds for lower-rated borrowers unable to raise funds at an acceptable cost
in other markets.
A growing number of sovereign borrowers which do not command top credit
ratings are discovering the market. Thailand, which carries a single-A
credit rating, tapped the market earlier this year. Mexico and Turkey are
expected to follow in the next few weeks, with east European borrowers such
as Hungary also considering issues.
Mexico is expected to launch a Dollars 250m 10-year deal via Goldman Sachs,
Merrill Lynch and J. P. Morgan, while Turkey is planning a Dollars 200m
deal, probably maturing in seven years, via J. P. Morgan and Salomon
Brothers.
Another group of issuers are European banks, which have caught on to the
fact that the Yankee bond market provides a rare opportunity to raise
subordinated debt, which counts as capital under the Basle guidelines on
international bank capital adequacy.
Finland's Kansallis-Osake-Pankki and Germany's Landeskreditbank both raised
subordinated debt last month. A string of others, including more
Scandinavian banks, are expected to follow. Banque Paribas, the French bank,
and Bayerische Landesbank, the German bank, are among the names circulated
among bond market participants.
Lower-rated European companies are also finding that they can raise debt
finance more cheaply in the Yankee market than in the Eurobond market. This
is a sharp reversal from the 1980s, when only top-quality European borrowers
could gain access to the US market.
Since the start of 1991, however, only 12 per cent of borrowers in the
Yankee bond market have carried a top triple-A credit rating. Single-A and
triple-B issuers have accounted for 60 per cent of the market, according to
Merrill Lynch.
One reason for the turnround is that many investment institutions have hired
credit analysts specialising in foreign debt in the past few years.
'US institutions have got up to speed on the credit composition of offshore
debt,' said Mr James Quigley, a managing director on Merrill Lynch's global
debt financing desk.
Improved access for overseas borrowers has not come in the areas where it
was expected. For example, the 144a market - a hybrid of public and private
placement markets widely expected to attract foreign borrowers because of
less stringent disclosure requirements - has failed to take off. However,
the introduction of Securities and Exchange Commission rule 144a in April
1990 focused the attention of US investors on foreign debt.
The recent growth of the Yankee bond market has been fuelled by demand from
US mutual funds, which have been experiencing a heavy inflow of funds.
Since the collapse of the junk bond market, fund managers have found it hard
to satisfy their appetite for higher-yielding securities, which has been
sharpened by the current low interest rate environment. Lower-rated overseas
issuers are providing a ready source of high-yielding bonds.
Although the US junk bond market has found its form again, the heavy pace of
junk bond issuance has been almost matched by early redemption of
outstanding junk debt, often due to refinancing.
Last month, for example, Dollars 3.4bn of outstanding debt was retired,
compared with Dollars 3.5bn in new issues, according to Mr Edward Mally,
director of high yield research at Salomon Brothers.
Even with Dollars 5bn junk bond issuance pending, there is still likely to
be pent-up demand for high yielding securities.
In addition, changes in the regulations governing insurance companies have
increased the amount of capital they must hold against junk bonds, so that
better rated but still high-yielding securities may prove an attractive
alternative.
While US institutions have become more interested in higher yielding
securities issued by foreign borrowers, European investors have become
increasingly credit sensitive.
As a result of their relative credit assessments, triple-A rated government
agencies, for example, can normally raise funds about 5-10 basis points more
cheaply in the Eurobond market, while single-A credits and lower can save
varying but often substantial amounts by tapping the Yankee market.

FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Gilts: Investors view PSBR projections with composure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN forecasts of a 1992-1993 public sector borrowing requirement of about
Pounds 30bn began circulating shortly before the general election, investors
in gilt-edged stock reacted with alarm.
Their fears were hardly surprising. Faced with slow growth, how would a new
 -possibly Labour - government cope with such a big public sector deficit?
Fears of rising long-term interest rates were compounded by forecasts of
sharply growing borrowing requirements in future years.
Worries over the size of the deficit appear, however, to have been allayed,
or at least postponed. The election result, the ease with which the Bank of
England is meeting its funding requirements and recent anti-inflationary
policy statements from Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, and the Bank
suggest that gilt-edged investors can look upon current public sector
borrowing requirement projections with equanimity.
The Treasury is sticking - so far - to its Budget forecast of a PSBR of
Pounds 28bn in 1992-1993. This is slightly less than many City forecasts
which predict a figure of about Pounds 30bn. Last week's figure of Pounds
3.6bn in April was the biggest for that month since 1987, suggesting the
deficit is on course to fulfil the gloomier prophecies.
But it now appears that the Bank has met more than a third of its funding
requirements for the entire 1992-1993 fiscal year since the election.
The City has gained a better insight into the matter since publication of
the latest Bank of England quarterly bulletin last week.
Two tranches of stock were issued in the early hours of April 10 as the
country awoke to the Conservative election victory. These amounted to Pounds
1.6bn. But the bulletin says that 'including sales made on April 10, gross
official sales of some Pounds 4bn were made in the first 10 days of April'.
This suggests the Bank sold a further Pounds 2.4bn of 'unofficial' stock
that was on its books from the period of buying-in in the late 1980s, by
April 10.
Since then, a further Pounds 5.7bn of issues and a call of about Pounds 600m
took the total of known funding to Pounds 10.25bn, says Mr Nigel Richardson,
an economist at S. G. Warburg. He estimates a further Pounds 1bn of
unofficial sales, taking gross sales since the start of the financial year
to about Pounds 11.25bn, or over a third of the Bank's funding requirements.
Recent policy statements have also helped foster a more relaxed view of a
PSBR which, if forecasts prove correct, will amount to 4.5 per cent of gross
domestic product in 1992-1993.
Neither the chancellor nor the Bank are satisfied that the battle against
inflation is over. A new anti-inflation drive appears to be in the offing.
Last week Mr Lamont said Britain should aim to match the inflation
performance of the Japanese, which is around 2 per cent, if it wants to be a
'first rank commercial power'.
Even so, there are precious few signs that the recovery has begun; and the
combination of high real interest rates and high levels of consumer and
commercial debt suggest it may be sluggish. The longer it takes to arrive
and the slower it is when it does, the bigger the future fiscal headache.
The Bank of England issued Pounds 800m of partly-paid 9 per cent conversion
stock due 2000 at a price of 100.75 per cent on Friday.

NATIONAL Bank of New Zealand, the fourth largest bank in New Zealand,
unveiled a 22 per cent increase in net profit from NZDollars 67m to
NZDollars 82m (USDollars 44m) for 1991, writes Terry Hall in Wellington.
The bank said it expected to see its strong presence in the corporate and

Total assets rose 3.7 per cent to NZDollars 7.56bn. Restructuring in the

FT  26 MAY 92 / European Bonds: German bunds rally as return of positive
sentiment continues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RETURN of positive sentiment to European government bond markets
continued last week, but this time the German market led the way.
The first reason for the rally in bund prices was the decision of IG Metall,
the engineering union, to accept a compromise settlement with employers over
pay.
The second spur to a rally came on Friday, with money supply statistics for
April proving far less awful than feared. M3 grew by 8.8 per cent during the
month, down from 9.4 per cent in March.
This is outside the central bank's 3.5 to 5.5 per cent target range, but
well below the 11 per cent growth forecast by some analysts early in the
week.
Any further rise in interest rates is now seen as unlikely and by Friday
attention was again turning to when the Bundesbank will ease monetary
conditions. Opinion is split on the timing of the next cut, but there is
widespread agreement bund yields are heading lower. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is
forecasting 10-year bund yields at around 7.30 per cent by the year end,
from 7.92 per cent on Friday.
Lower bund yields should pass through into other European markets, since
investors judge the relative value of markets on the basis of the yield
spread to the bund market.
For example, by the end of last week French government 10-year bonds were
yielding 8.5 per cent, or 58 basis points more than their German
counterparts. If this is maintained, French bonds should yield 7.88 per cent
by December.
However, there are additional gains to be made where the yield spread over
German bonds narrows. French bonds are so popular with international
investors at present that a narrowing of yield spread is quite possible. The
French government auctioned FFr12.8bn two-year and five-year paper last week
 -but received bids for FFr53bn stock.

FT  26 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Hafnia turns in DKr1.65bn
loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY BARNES
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   COPENHAGEN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAFNIA HOLDING, the Danish insurance-based financial services group,
suffered a first quarter loss of about DKr1.65bn (Dollars 264m) and its
equity capital was cut from DKr3.12bn at the end of 1991 to DKr1.45bn, the
company said yesterday.
The main reason for the deficit were adjustments for the value of its
shareholdings in domestic rival Baltica and Sweden's Skandia.
Before the adjustments, the loss came out at about DKr70m compared with a
profit of DKr30m in the corresponding period last year.
Following a board decision at the end of April to reject a takeover offer by
Skandia, Hafnia shareholders will be asked at the annual meeting on June 2
to approve a new share issue raising about DKr1.5bn.
The issue will be made in the second half of June with preferential rights
for existing shareholders, who will be asked to subscribe to three new
shares for every two held at a price of DKr105 per share with a par value of
DKr100.
The statement from the embattled group said the final results for 1992 will
be crucially dependent on the price at which its Baltica and Skandia
shareholdings can be sold.
Hafnia has a 13.5 per cent stake in Skandia, 33.5 per cent in Baltica
Holding and about 11 per cent in Baltica Insurance.
These holdings could, in a favourable market, be sold at a price exceeding
the quoted price, said the statement.
It also said that in addition to the book value of its equity capital, there
is additional goodwill value in the Danish and UK life assurance businesses
and in the Danish and Swedish general insurance businesses of DKr2bn-DKr3bn.

FT  26 MAY 92 / US Money and Credit: Economy-watchers turn their attention
to a week of data
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER last week, when hopes for an interest rate cut were apparently dashed
on the rocks of the Federal Reserve's Open Market Committee, trading in the
US Treasury markets should settle down to a less stressful pattern over the
next four days.
Nevertheless, the economic calendar this week provides plenty for investors
and economy-watchers to chew on.
On Tuesday, April existing home sales data are released. Salomon Brothers in
New York is forecasting a modest decline because of the cold weather during
the month and the effect of the back-up in mortgage rates since mid-January.
On the same day, the Conference Board publishes its closely followed
Consumer Confidence Index for May, and the consensus on Wall Street is that
the index will rise to its highest level since late last year.
Wednesday kicks off with durable goods orders for April, and a fourth
consecutive monthly increase in orders is expected. While Thursday is full
of secondary data, the most important news of the week arrives on Friday in
the shape of the revised (real) first quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP)
figures. Economists now expect first quarter GDP to show an increase of 3
per cent.
The solid output growth in the first quarter which should be confirmed by
Friday's data probably played an important part in persuading the Fed last
week not to cut interest rates.
At the FOMC meeting on Tuesday and Wednesday, the Fed's policy-makers were
reported by inside sources to have voted to keep monetary policy unchanged
and to drop their bias toward easing until the next scheduled meeting in
late June.
The immediate reaction of the markets to the news was to sell Treasuries,
which had been bid up over a period of several days in anticipation of an
interest rate cut by a Fed supposedly worried about the sluggishness of the
economic recovery, and by weakness in money supply and labour market
conditions in particular.
The market, however, may have overdone its reaction to the FOMC's reported
move from a bias toward easing to what is known as a 'symmetric' policy
guideline (neither biased toward easing or tightening).
As Mr Richard Trainer, chief economist at the Bank of Tokyo in New York
points out in his most recent circular on Fedspeak, the Fed has a reputation
for often doing exactly what it says it is not likely to do. He backs up
this view with an examination of Fed actions between the end of March 1991
and the following August.
During that time, policy was also symmetric. Yet over the five-month period
the Fed reacted to evidence of economic weakness by cutting the discount
rate by 50 basis points to 5.5 per cent and the Fed funds rate target by 50
basis points to 5.5 per cent. Mr Trainer's conclusion is simple: 'policy
symmetry does not preclude the Fed from easing policy'. In other words, do
not rule out the possibility of another interest rate cut just yet. The
market may have to wait for an easing until June 5, when the Employment
Report for May is published.

intensifies

<TEXT>
NTT, the Japanese telecommunications group, yesterday reported a 14.8 per
cent drop in unconsolidated pre-tax earnings to Y352.8bn (Dollars 2.7bn) for
fiscal 1991.
It predicted that profits will decline by 24.3 per cent to Y267bn in fiscal
1992 on unchanged sales as competition increases in the deregulated Japanese
market. Net profit will drop by 28.5 per cent to Y134bn.
The profits slide in fiscal 1991 was due to a 8.8 per cent fall in operating
profit to Y528.7bn and a growing financial income deficit, which increased
by 6.5 per cent to Y175.3bn. Net income fell by 16.5 per cent to Y187.3bn.
Sales increased by a modest 1.6 per cent to Y6bn, reflecting telephone rate
cuts and sluggish growth in new subscribers. NTT has been losing market
share, particularly in the areas of long-distance calls and mobile telephone
services, to specialised carriers.
It was forced to cut long-distance rates in March 1991 to match lower rates
offered by competitors. This contributed to a 3.7 per cent decline in call
rate revenues, which account for about half of total sales.
The growth in operating costs outpaced income with a 2.8 per cent rise
because of expanded digitisation and efforts to improve customer services.
NTT's growing net financial deficit reflected a 6 per cent fall in financial
income to Y71.4bn, while financial expenses grew by 2.6 per cent to Y246.8bn
due to a devaluation of NTT's securities portfolio.
It will retain its dividend at Y5,000 per share. NTT is being opened to
foreign investment, which will be limited to holding 20 per cent.

FT  26 MAY 92 / International Company News: Earnings at shipbuilders
squeezed as sales improve
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MITSUBISHI Heavy Industries and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries,
Japan's leading shipbuilders, posted firm sales due to brisk demand in their
shipping divisions. However profits were squeezed by a slump in industrial
machinery demand due to the economic slowdown, and an increase in
non-operating costs.
MHI posted a 1.8 per cent rise in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to a
record Y155.5bn (Dollars 1.2bn) on a 6.8 per cent increase in sales to a
record Y2,484.2bn. Operating profits grew 12.1 per cent to Y176.6bn, and
after-tax profits rose 9.1 per cent to Y105.7bn.
Its financial balance fell from a profit of Y14.3bn to Y4bn due to lower
interest received on deposits, and an increase of interest payments.
For the current year to March 1993, MHI forecasts a decline in demand, and
sees a 3.7 per cent fall in non-consolidated pre-tax profits to Y150bn on a
0.6 per cent rise in sales to Y2,500bn.
Sales at IHI rose 11 per cent, thanks to strong sales in its shipbuilding
sector. However, pre-tax profits plunged 21 per cent to Y21.4bn due to
losses from an affiliate's deposits at BCCI.
After-tax profits increased 26.5 per cent to Y19.2bn as a result of
extraordinary profits from the sale of a stake in a Singapore shipping
company.
IHI posted Y5.8bn in loan-loss reserves to cover half of the Y12.7bn
deposits of its affiliate at BCCI.

sharply

   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S seven trust banks suffered sharp falls in earnings for the year to
March, due to thinner profit margins and falls in commission revenue after
the plunge in the stock and real estate markets.
Combined non-consolidated pre-tax profits fell 33.8 per cent to Y248.1bn
(Dollars 1.9bn), while combined net business profits, or profits from core
banking business declined 12.6 per cent to Y217.5bn. Sumitomo and Mitsubishi
saw double digit increases in net business profits thanks to firm earnings
at their international divisions.
Profit margins fell sharply due to the time-lag between the fall in money
market rates and the review of dividends on their loan trusts, which account
for half the trust banks' business. Trust fees shrank 12.8 per cent to a
combined Y510.7bn.
Service income fell 38.2 per cent to Y155bn, due to the sluggish real estate
market. Profits on securities transactions, including appraisal losses, fell
5.6 per cent to Y24bn.
Fund transactions improved 20 times to Y85.8bn, thanks to widening market
interest rate spreads. Profits from international business increased by 37.7
per cent to Y326.6bn, buoyed by lower interest rates overseas.
The trust banks also saw sharp declines in commission revenue from
investment trust management. The sharp falls in share prices and last year's
increasing number of companies to cancel their stock fund trusts.
Mitsubishi had Y2,000bn in outstanding fund trusts, down from Y2,400bn,
while the balance fell from Y1,900bn to Y1,400bn at Sumitomo. Mitsui
reported a sharp drop in its fund trust balance at Y670bn from Y1,470bn.
The poor results have forced Yasuda and Toyo to cut dividends for fiscal
1991 by Y0.75 per share.
For the current year to March 1993, the trust banks expect profits growth to
remain flat due to continued sluggishness in the stock and real estate
markets.

FT  26 MAY 92 / International Company News: Japanese camera makers turn in
gloomy results
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN's camera makers have been forced to readjust their focus amid a gloomy
earnings season in which Minolta, once the industry leader, reported an
after-tax loss of Y25.8bn (Dollars 199m) and most other producers predicted
a bleak year ahead.
Restructuring programmes in the industry, begun when the domestic economy
was expanding rapidly, have run into the troubles of recession, complicating
the companies' entry into new markets.
Earnings at Minolta were also dragged down by the settlement of a US patent
dispute in March, forcing the company to write-off Y16.9bn. This came on top
of a pre-tax loss of Y8.5bn, a turnround from a profit of Y4.9bn the
previous year and the company's first loss for 26 years.
Minolta was also weakened by stock market turmoil, as its unrealised gains
on long-term holdings of shares fell from Y57bn to Y27.7bn, and cash
deposits, seen as a mark of strength in Japan, were halved to Y14.5bn.
Traditionally strong in foreign markets, Minolta's long-term strategy
included the aims of increasing the share of domestic camera sales and
expanding the office equipment business.
But the company has had difficulty penetrating the crowded domestic office
equipment market, where its sales last year fell 5.6 per cent, while exports
of office machinery rose 7.3 per cent - camera exports fell 12.8 per cent
and domestic camera sales were down 7.9 per cent.
Minolta's total sales for the year were 2.9 per cent lower at Y215.6bn, and
while the company confidently predicted sales would rise to Y228bn in the
current period, it forecast another pre-tax loss of Y4bn.
Nikon, the camera and semiconductor equipment maker, reported a 62.4 per
cent plunge to Y7.2bn in its pre-tax profit, following weak demand from
Japanese semiconductor producers, which are facing large losses on their
investments in the present generation of memory chips.
Sales for the year fell 9.4 per cent to Y230.6bn, and Nikon forecast a
difficult year ahead, with sales expected at Y228bn and pre-tax profits
declining to Y4bn. By product line, camera sales fell 6 per cent and
semiconductor equipment by 21.2 per cent.
Ricoh, now reliant on copiers and information equipment for most of its
sales, reported a 70.7 per cent fall in pre-tax profit to Y7.4bn, and a 0.7
per cent sales decline at Y672.7bn. The company said the weakness of the US
market hurt original equipment manufacturer orders for its copiers and fax
machines.
It also blamed 'currency fluctuations' for the downturn, that is, the
appreciation of the yen.

write-offs

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
CENTRAL CAPITAL, once one of Canada's fastest growing financial services
groups, suffered a final loss of CDollars 1.5bn (USDollars 1.25bn) for 1991
after writing off Dollars 760m covering its investment in 80 per cent-owned
Central Guaranty Trustco. In 1990, Central Capital reported a loss of
CDollars 44m.
Central Capital, controlled by financier Mr Leonard Ellen, quadrupled its
assets to CDollars 17bn in a buying spree in the last half of the 1980s.
Guaranty Trustco operates the country's fourth largest trust company, which
has been hit by the long recession and drastic decline in property values in
eastern Canada.
Central Capital's total loss also included write-downs of investments in
subsidiaries and a CDollars 200m write-off of goodwill. It is negotiating
with its vendors to restructure its debt.
About 63 per cent of the trust company's business, including assets of
CDollars 7bn, is being sold to Canada Trustco and National Bank of Canada,
and the rest will be consolidated mainly in southern Ontario, if regulators
approve.

FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Singer &amp; Friedlander interested in
Ansbacher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SINGER &amp; Friedlander, the merchant banking and property group, is in talks
which could lead to a takeover of Henry Ansbacher, the small City merchant
bank.
Singer has been in discussions with Ansbacher and its majority shareholder,
Pargesa, which is controlled by Mr Paul Desmarais, the Montreal financier,
and the Frere Group of Belgium.
Mr Anthony Solomons, chairman of Singer, confirmed there had been 'very
preliminary conversations about a potential merger.'
Ansbacher is likely to make a statement this morning confirming the
discussions, although few other details are expected. It is understood the
Bank of England has been informed about the talks.
Pargesa first tried to sell its 61.6 per cent stake in Ansbacher in 1990,
but failed to find a buyer at an acceptable price. It bought a 30 per cent
interest in Ansbacher in 1984 and was later forced to inject a further
Pounds 100m when the London bank ran into trouble.
Since then it has seen the value of its investment fall considerably.
Ansbacher's share price was 78p in 1990, valuing the stake at close to
Pounds 90m. But the shares have since fallen, following losses last year of
Pounds 8.23m, and closed last week at 29p, suggesting Pargesa's stake is now
worth only Pounds 33m.
If Singer bought Pargesa's stake, it would be forced under the takeover code
to make a full offer to other Ansbacher holders. These include
administrators of the late Mr Robert Maxwell with 10 per cent, the Kuwait
Investment Office (10 per cent) and ADT, the security systems company (3.5
per cent).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mosaic Investments, which licenses cartoon characters such as Tom &amp; Jerry
and the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, said it was in talks which could lead
to a bid for the company.
The announcement was prompted by the rise in the share price from a low of
92p last Tuesday to 122p on Friday. The shares were 206p in March until a
profits warning wiped 40 per cent off in a single day.
Mr Leon Angrave, managing director, said the discussions with the other
party were 'amicable' for the moment. If there was to be an offer, he said,
it was likely to be at a small premium to the 110p price at which the
announcement had been triggered.
The potential bidder is believed to be in a similar business to Mosaic.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Shares in Willaire Group, which last October put its electronics arm into
liquidation, were suspended at 1 1/4 p on Friday pending clarification of
the group's financial state.
In December it announced a Pounds 2.04m loss for the year to April 30 and
said it was unable to pay a dividend on either the ordinary or the
preference shares because of a lack of distributable reserves.
The company had launched a Pounds 4.5m rights issue in May with the aim of
using part of the funds for the electronics business. In September, however,
it put that division into liquidation just a few days after changing the
divisional name from Willaire Electronics to Airmead.
Before the rights issue, the group's debts amounted to about Pounds 12m.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In the six months ended November 30 1991, Millwall Holdings turned in a loss
of Pounds 1.1m, against Pounds 1.53m previously.
The period included the three months close football season, when the
football club received no income.
Continuing activities accounted for Pounds 898,000 of the loss, from
turnover of Pounds 872,000. In September the company disposed of Tavern
Leisure for Pounds 2.4m cash.
The sale gave rise to a profit of Pounds 877,000 in the holding company's
accounts and to Pounds 441,000 in the group accounts. However, the group
needs to reflect goodwill previously written off in the loss of disposal;
therefore, an extraordinary loss of Pounds 1.98m will arise in the group
accounts for the year.
Losses per share for the half year were 0.98p (1.35p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BLYSTAD, the UK oil services and drilling group, is considering steps to
recover Dollars 3.6m lent to a company owned by trusts in which three of its
directors, including the chairman, are beneficially interested.
The announcement was made as the group revealed sharply higher pre-tax
losses for 1991 of Pounds 4.1m (Pounds 290,000).
Mr Wilhelm Blystad, chairman, said the loan - which related to the option
held by Sokana Industries on a Mexican shipyard - had been reduced by
Dollars 1m, but still not repaid by the due date of March 31. Blystad's
independent directors were 'considering what action is appropriate to
recover the loan and are currently discussing the position with Sokana,' he
said.
During the year Blystad increased turnover by 10 per cent to Pounds 25.5m.
Exceptional charges, including write-downs on the development of its
floating oil production project and the value of the semi-submersible
drilling rig, came to Pounds 3.9m.
Losses per share deepened from 0.55p to 3.06p. There was no dividend.

FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: WPP warns shareholders not to reject
refinancing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WPP, The troubled inter-national marketing services group which is seeking a
second refinancing from its 28-bank syndicate for its Dollars 1bn (Pounds
551.3m) debt, has prepared moves to bypass shareholder resistance to a
recapitalisation proposal announced on May 13 and approved by the four lead
banks.
According to an internal WPP document, if shareholders refuse to accept an
equity-debt exchange whereby the banks subscribe a rights issue worth some
Pounds 150m in exchange for reducing WPP's debt by about 25 per cent, then
there are three alternatives:
 -continuing with the 'status quo', which it warns will mean the 'group's
operational difficulties from perceived debt problems would continue; no
prospect of dividends on ordinary or preference shares in foreseeable
future' and, in the event of a group collapse, 'no value for shareholders'.
 -the issue of 'high yielding subordinated loan stock' with the
'possibility' of a clawback offer for existing shareholders to subscribe.
However, WPP warns this would mean 'high interest payment' preventing
'prospects of any eventual recovery in present shareholder value'.
 -or a new subsidiary would be established and listed on the stock exchange.
This would issue Pounds 150m of preferred ordinary shares to banks and the
issue would rapidly swamp any interest in the shares of the current WPP
group.

FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ascom loses Swiss status under foreign
ownership rules
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   ZURICH
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASCOM, the Swiss telecommunications equipment group, has become one of the
first leading Swiss companies to lose its Swiss status under the country's
law limiting property purchases by foreigners.
The problem is likely to become more widespread because many Swiss companies
are actively courting foreign investors and removing restrictions on share
ownership.
The so-called Lex Friedrich requires that companies be able to prove that
more than half of their capital is held by Swiss nationals. Otherwise, they
must submit each attempted property purchase to review.
Ascom confronted this challenge several months ago when it tried to buy a
few square metres of land for a telecoms installation.
The government demanded proof that more than half of Ascom's capital was in
Swiss ownership, but the company was unable to provide it. In fact, the
directors suspect that a majority is held by foreigners.
'We have evidence of considerable foreign investment in our company,' Mr
Heinz Frey, chairman, said yesterday.
About 80 per cent of Ascom's issued capital is in bearer form, so it is
impossible to know where it is owned. However, even if a majority of the
capital is held abroad, the voting control is clearly in the hands of Swiss
nationals.
Ascom reported a 12 per cent gain in sales in the first four months of 1992
to SFr1.01bn.
Oerlikon-Buhrle, the long troubled Swiss armaments and engineering group,
made a small net profit in the first quarter, its first in more than six
years.
Sales were up 8.7 per cent to SFr788m (Dollars 518.4m) and the operating
profit was SFr100m better than in the comparative period.

FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Company News: GPG issues writ against Morgan Grenfell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORGAN GRENFELL has been served with a writ by one of its former fund
management clients, GPG, charging that the securities firm placed its own
interests above those of its client and failed to meet its fiduciary duties.
The writ was served late on Friday by GPG, a UK-based investment company.
GPG alleges that Morgan called in loans to Egerton Trust, because of fears
about Egerton's financial stability, but did not consider the interests of
GPG, whose funds Morgan had invested in Egerton.
The writ says GPG lost Pounds 4m invested by Morgan in commercial paper or
short term securities of Egerton Trust, a housebuilding and construction
company now in receivership.
GPG notes in its writ that Morgan Grenfell, which was allowed to select
investments for GPG without consulting the client, was at the same time a
lender to Egerton and a dealer in the commercial paper which it purchased on
GPG's behalf.
The writ says that just weeks after Morgan Grenfell's treasury management
division increased GPG's investment in Egerton's commercial paper, Morgan
Grenfell's corporate finance division declared the company in default of an
earlier loan, demanding - and receiving - repayment in full.
Morgan did so despite a warning from Egerton that such a move would force it
to default on commercial paper falling due shortly.
The case raises questions about whether the so-called Chinese Walls intended
to insulate the corporate finance and fund management arms of securities
houses from each other actually undermine the interests of investors. Morgan
Grenfell did not return phone calls on Friday about the matter.
On December 15 1988, Morgan Grenfell agreed to be a lender to Egerton Trust.
It was party to a multi-currency loan facility under which it would lend
Egerton up to Pounds 4m.
Seven months later, in July 1989, Morgan Grenfell acted as arranger and
joint dealer for a Pounds 50m commercial paper programme on behalf of
Egerton.
The securities did not carry a credit rating - a characteristic of riskier
debt - and the investing circular warned buyers that the dealers had not
verified the accuracy of information. Each purchaser was warned that it
would have to evaluate the credit of Egerton on its own.
In January 1990, Morgan Grenfell became the discretionary fund manager for
GPG, a role which gave it full authority to invest funds on GPG's behalf
without prior approval. The funds under management ranged from Pounds 18m to
Pounds 32m over time, and among the initial investments chosen by Morgan
Grenfell for GPG was Pounds 3m in Egerton's commercial paper.
When that paper matured on June 1, Morgan Grenfell rolled it over on GPG's
behalf and purchased an additional Pounds 1m worth. But just three weeks
later, Morgan Grenfell told Egerton's management that it was in default on
its loan agreement, that it wanted immediate full repayment of Pounds 4m and
that no more funds would be extended.
On July 6, Egerton told Morgan Grenfell that if no further funds were
extended, it would be unable to repay commercial paper maturing shortly.
In its writ, GPG charged that Morgan Grenfell, by insisting on repayment of
its own loan, allowed its interests to conflict with those of GPG. GPG said
it knew nothing of Egerton's financial difficulties until August 1, when it
was told that the company was unable to repay commercial paper maturing that
day.
Mr Blake Nixon, managing director of GPG, said on Friday that because of the
'health warning' in the circular, even if Chinese walls were in place,
Morgan Grenfell's investment arm had a duty to investigate the
creditworthiness of Egerton. This duty should have involved more than usual
scrutiny because of Morgan Grenfell's own involvement with the company.
GPG was only one of several investors who recorded losses on Egerton's
commercial paper. Mr Russell Wells, finance director at Coats Viyella, said
that Pounds 10m of the company's treasury funds had been invested in the
securities.
While Morgan Grenfell did not advise the company to make the purchase, Mr
Wells said it was 'a disappointment' that his company had not been advised
of Egerton's deteriorating financial position. He also said that he did not
realise that Morgan Grenfell had been a lender to Egerton at the same time
as it had been arranger and joint dealer on its commercial paper programme.
On June 8 1991 receivers were called in at Egerton.

collapse
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
Profits of Fitzwilton, the Dublin-based holding company, dived from IPounds
10.4m to IPounds 200,000 (Pounds 182,000) pre-tax for 1991. Turnover
improved by 13 per cent to IPounds 453m.
Main interests are in cash and carry and car distribution in the UK. It also
has a 9 per cent holding in the troubled Waterford Wedgewood crystal and
ceramics group.
Mr Ken McGoran, chief executive, said: 'It has been a very tough year, both
because of the recession and the reorganisation of the cash and carry
business, but we are positioned to come back strongly once the economy picks
up.'
Market analysts described the results as 'extremely disappointing,' and
expressed surprise at the extent of the collapse in profits.
Mr McGoran said the company had no immediate plans for geographic
diversification to reduce its heavy dependence on the UK market. The
immediate target was to get back to a strong level of profitability.
New car sales in the UK fell by 15 per cent although turnover was only
marginally down at Pounds 187m (Pounds 189m).
Cash and carry turnover rose to Pounds 201m (Pounds 154m), but the recession
affected sales of non-food discretionary items, a feature of that business.
There was an exceptional charge of IPounds 1.5m for integrating four
cash-and-carry operations into one, and an extraordinary IPounds 2.7m for
writing down the holding in Atlantic Resources.
Losses per share emerged at 0.63p (earnings 7.11p). A final dividend of 2p
makes a same-again 3.5p total.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Lloyds Bank turns to US to stall rival bid for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS Bank is making a last ditch attempt to delay Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation's bid for Midland Bank by lodging a formal objection
with the Federal Reserve, the US central bank, to Hongkong Bank's proposal
to have the Fed's review of the bid put on a 'fast track'.
Meanwhile, it also emerged yesterday that Midland's legal advisers will
consider today whether Midland's board would fail in its duty to its
shareholders if the board formally recommends the Hongkong bid. This follows
Friday's decision by Mr Michael Heseltine, president of the board of trade,
to refer Lloyds' proposed offer for Midland to the Monopolies and Mergers
Commission.
Mr Brian Pearse, Midland chief executive, said the board would like to make
such a recommendation. If it were to do so, Hongkong Bank could probably
count on receiving acceptances to its bid from at least 25 per cent of
Midland's shareholders which would improve its chances of winning the bid
contest.
Although Lloyds is proposing to offer considerably more than Hongkong Bank
to buy Midland, many Midland shareholders may accept Hongkong Bank's terms
because of uncertainty over whether the MMC will permit a formal offer from
Lloyds.
Lloyds is therefore keen to prevent Hongkong Bank buying Midland shares
until the MMC makes a decision on Lloyds's bid proposal in three months. It
believes the Federal Reserve may be able to delay the Hongkong takeover
attempt for this period.
Fed approval is necessary for Hongkong Bank to acquire Midland's US assets.
Hongkong Bank had hoped the Fed would give preliminary approval immediately,
subject to the small risk that Hongkong Bank would later be forced to
dispose of Midland's US assets after a detailed Fed review had been
completed.
However, Lloyds, in a document lodged with the Fed last week, is asking the
Fed not to give such 'fast track' approval but to carry out a detailed
investigation. If the Fed agrees, that could prevent Hongkong Bank buying
Midland shares until the review is completed.
In the document, Lloyds is understood to question Hongkong Bank's record in
managing its main US business, Marine Midland.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Tapie statement casts doubt over empire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR BERNARD Tapie, who on Saturday resigned from the French cabinet and
tomorrow will appear in a Paris court to give evidence in a fraud case, is
considering selling his controlling stake in Adidas, the German sportswear
company which is one of the world's best known brand names.
Mr Tapie said he may cede control of Adidas, the lynchpin of his business.
Coupled with his resignation on Saturday night as France's minister of urban
affairs after only seven weeks in the post, the statement marks a watershed
in the career of one of the most controversial figures in French industry
and politics.
Mr Tapie, 49 has rarely been far from the headlines since shooting to
prominence as one of France's most aggressive entrepreneurs in the
mid-1980s. He had made his fortune by buying up bankrupt businesses.
By the late 1980s he had set his sights on politics. In 1989 he became a
member of parliament for Marseilles and the following year he bought Adidas,
reportedly for FFr2bn (Pounds 202.6m), announcing the deal - in true Tapie
style - on the eve of the World Cup final.
However, the French business establishment doubted the feasibility of buying
Adidas, which was worth much more than his existing interests. There was
also controversy over his chairmanship of the Olympique Marseille football
club and a French stock market investigation into his share dealings.
His political career was viewed with the same suspicion. President Francois
Mitterrand and Mr Pierre Beregovoy, prime minister, were criticised for
championing his appointment as minister.
Last week's news that Mr Tapie was to appear in court after accusations from
his former business partner that he embezzled FFr13m from the sale of a
company in 1985 to Toshiba, the Japanese electronics group, was the final
straw. His resignation has been interpreted by the French press as an
embarrassing blow for Mr Beregovoy.
Now, the future of Adidas, which made pre-tax profits of DM44m (Pounds
14.9m) on sales of DM3.53bn last year, is in the balance. If Mr Tapie does
sell his 54 per cent holding, the likeliest buyer is Pentland, the cash-rich
UK consumer products company which last year paid DM134.5m for 20 per cent
of the company.

FT  26 MAY 92 / A prosaic end to property prodigy: Why the receivers have
moved into Mountleigh
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mountleigh, the property company which went into receivership yesterday, was
perhaps the most audacious, unpredictable and controversial of all the
property traders to emerge in the 1980s property boom.
In just a few years, it was transformed from a small wool manufacturer into
a go-go property company, so highly rated by the stock market that it felt
able to make a Pounds 2bn bid for Storehouse, the retailing group, in 1987.
It continued in the same vein under new management, with extravagant but
unrealised promises of a Pounds 1bn acquisition. Its taste for controversy
eventually won it a public reprimand from the stock exchange.
Its ambitions were reflected in the illustrious cast of businessmen and
institutions that it attracted: Mr Tony Clegg, a blunt Lancastrian with a
sharp eye for a deal, Mr Nelson Peltz and Mr Peter May, two US entrepreneurs
who made a fortune from junk bonds and leveraged buy-outs, the Gordon Getty
Trust, the Pritzker family and Sir Ian MacGregor, the trouble-shooter
brought in by Mrs Thatcher to confront the mining industry.
But for all Mountleigh's aspirations, it was finally brought down by the
most prosaic of problems: it was overgeared and could not find buyers for
the property it needed to sell.
In particular, it can blame its demise on its inability to sell the Merry
Hill shopping centre in the Black Country. Earlier this year, Mountleigh
thought that it might be able to ride the storm. It agreed the sale of the
Merry Hill Centre to Hammerson, the UK property company, and the O'Connor
Group, a US pension fund adviser. The deal would have brought in Pounds
125m, which although less than the property's Pounds 160m book value, would
have allowed the company meet its coming obligations.
But the deal fell through at the end of last month. In part it was because
of the likelihood that the shopping centre was built on contaminated land, a
risk that had been heightened by the possibility that the government would
bring in a register of contaminated land.
That left Mountleigh without the funds it needed to meet vital payments due
in May and June. Last week, it failed to meet the interest payment due on
Pounds 47m of Swiss franc bonds; tomorrow it was due to redeem Pounds 40m of
Swiss bonds; and in June, it was required to redeem another Pounds 35m
tranche.
Compared with its bank and bond debts of some Pounds 550m, the company had
property assets of Pounds 775m at the time of its last balance sheet, in
April 1991. Apart from Pounds 34m written off at its interim results, the
receivers - Mr Tim Hayward and Mr Stephen James of accountants KPMG Peat
Marwick - do not expect further sizeable write-downs. Much though depends on
how long they have to make the disposals. If they are forced to make fire
sales in a depressed market, they could have difficulty covering the
company's debts.
Mountleigh's assets are a mixture of properties in the UK, including the
Camberley shopping centre, and a 50 per cent share of the Criterion in
London's Piccadilly as well as Galerias, the second largest retailer in
Spain. Although the company has pumped money into Galerias, in the last
interim results the store group made a Pounds 1.9m loss.
With hindsight, it is clear by the late 1980s that a company trying to
manage a struggling business in Spain as well as an assortment of projects
in the UK, was heading for trouble.
But the company set off in search of even greater ambitions, in the hands of
some entrepreneurs who had little experience of the property market. In late
1989, Mr Nelson Peltz and Mr Peter May, two US investors, had alighted on
Mountleigh as a suitable vehicle for a huge - but totally unspecified -
acquisition in Europe.
Shareholders felt dismayed when Mr Clegg delivered control of the company to
Mr Peltz and Mr May, without insisting that they mount a full-scale bid. Mr
Clegg sold his 22.5 per cent stake in the company for Pounds 70m, at 200p
per share, a 40 per cent premium to the market.
The institutions had a sense of deja vu 18 months later when Mr Peltz and Mr
May sold half their 22 per cent stake to the Gordon
Getty Family Trust. At 100p per share, the price was half the original cost
of the shares, but substantially more than the company's share price of 81p.
Shareholders' anger that only the directors had been able to sell above the
market price heightened six weeks later when Mountleigh announced a Pounds
96m rights issue as a condition for refinancing the company.
The stock exchange was provoked into issuing a public censure saying the
directors had breached its model code of conduct by dealing within the
two-month closed period while in possession of price-sensitive information.
The concerns of investors were also whipped up by the unusual rights issue
underwriting structure.
The publication of Mountleigh's annual report shortly afterwards, which
showed that the management had nearly doubled their salaries, did nothing to
placate investors.
The institutions' faith in Mountleigh's ability to recover was dwindling by
the month. When in October, the chairman and three joint managing directors
of Mountleigh resigned, just before its annual meeting, its share price at
around 15p barely stirred.
But even though the company was clearly down, it was not yet out. Sir Ian
MacGregor moved from deputy chairman to chairman. In April this year, the
company strengthened its management by bringing in Mr Steven Gerard, a
senior executive of Citibank, as chief executive to thrash out a
restructuring plan.
But the hope of keeping the company afloat died on Saturday when
Mountleigh's banks turned down the company's proposals to ask its
bondholders for a breathing space while it put together restructuring
proposals.
They felt able to pull the rug because they did not believe that confidence
in the property market would be severely damaged - in a market inured to
appalling news, confidence could get no worse.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Wellcome announces share issue timetable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME GROUP, the British pharmaceutical company, will publish on June 4
the prospectus for its planned share issue. The issue, expected to be the
largest by any privately-owned British company, will be launched in
mid-July.
The timetable was agreed late last week by the board of Wellcome Group.
There had been suggestions the issue would be delayed until September, but
managers are anxious that preparations for the launch should not distract
them from running the business.
Wellcome Trust, the charitable body which owns 73.6 per cent of Wellcome
Group, was given permission last month by the Charity Commission to sell up
to 417m shares, reducing its holding in the company to as little as 25 per
cent. The issue could raise more than Pounds 4bn.
The prospectus is likely to highlight the strength of Wellcome's research
and the encouraging prospects for its two top-selling anti-virus drugs,
Zovirax, which is used to treat herpes, and Retrovir, the Aids treatment.
Wellcome executives are in the final stages of negotiation with two or
possibly three groups to set up co-marketing agreements for over-the-counter
(OTC) non-prescription products.
In particular, Wellcome is anxious to develop the OTC market for Zovirax
when its patents begin to expire in the mid-1990s.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Economics Notebook: Not the time to gloat over Japan's
shocks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE little-remarked casualty of Japan's stock market collapse has been the
excuse many western firms offered for their inability to compete with
Japanese rivals: that Japanese businesses faced an unfairly low cost of
capital.
The slide in the stock market, and the rise in interest rates which helped
cause it, have between them brought about a sharp rise in the cost of
capital in Japan.
Throughout the 1980s, the low price that Japanese businesses paid to raise
capital was cited as an important advantage that had helped them to become
ever more fearsome international competitors.
Since complaints about Japan's cost of capital surfaced in the early 1980s,
the issue has followed a switchback: at first, as the equity boom lowered
Japan's cost of capital to absurdly low levels, the debate assumed
ever-greater public prominence.
A survey article published by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York in 1991
lists 24 learned articles on the topic, which had by now moved out of the
realm of academic debate and into the arena of public controversy.
Just as that article was published, the problem was solving itself: as the
stock market plunged, Japan's cost of capital rose sharply.
It has taken economists a while to catch up with this development - a study
just published by JP Morgan's Mr Richard Mattione* appears to be the first
thorough analysis of the effect of the stock market slide on Japan's cost of
capital - but Japanese companies have reacted much faster. A debate has
erupted in Japan about exactly how best to respond in the medium term to the
new era of costly capital; but in the short term investment plans have been
sharply cut back and businesses in which companies had no major advantage
apart from a low cost of capital are coming under scrutiny.
A company's cost of capital - how much it pays in interest to its banks and
bond-holders, and by way of dividends to the holders of its equity - lies at
the heart of its decision-making.
As the Federal Reserve points out, a company faced with a 4 per cent cost of
capital might rationally be prepared to wait 46 years for a project to break
even; one paying 12 per cent only six years. A higher cost of capital
drastically shortens a company's (and a shareholder's) time horizon.
The traditional explanation of the cost of capital advantage for Japanese
companies, as summed up by Morgan's Mr Mattione, had three parts: 'Japanese
firms have an advantage over their competitors because they use more debt
(the lower-cost funding vehicle), because they pay less for debt, and
because they also pay less for equity.'
Though Japanese companies were undoubtedly much more highly indebted than
their rivals for much of the post-war period, it is not clear whether they
were paying less for this debt during the economy's high-growth period, the
1950s and 1960s.
Japanese economists say interest rates were consistently very high during
this period: critics of Japan's trading practices argue that priority
industries received preferential treatment, and that the whole savings
market was distorted to provide cheap funds for industrial investment.
The issue only became a heated one in the 1980s, just as Japan's cost of
debt was rising towards international levels: its cost of equity was about
to plunge; and the capital structure of its corporations became much closer
to that of competitors.
The remarkable rise of the Tokyo stock market offered a wide range of
opportunities to raise cheap capital - and Japanese companies filled their
boots. Of the 2,000 listed Japanese companies, more than 1,100 raised funds
through share offerings or equity-linked bonds during the three years ending
in 1989. In 1989 alone, Japanese companies raised Y27,000bn (Pounds 115bn)
of equity-related finance, more than four times the amount issued in 1986,
and more than all that issued in the years 1980-1986 added together.
This capital was raised very cheaply, as the price-earnings ratio of the 225
issues in the Nikkei index was consistently above 60 during the latter part
of the 1980s. At the time, big US companies were trading at p/e ratios of
under 20. Even if you adjust the Japanese p/e ratio to reflect the higher
growth prospects of Japanese companies, the large number of
cross-shareholdings in the Japanese market, and so on, Japanese p/e ratios
were double those of the US.
Allowing for those factors, that gap 'should have made Japanese firms
willing to accept operating returns on capital as much as 8 percenage points
below those acceptable to US firms', according to Mr Mattione. They grasped
that opportunity with both hands, as the Japanese capital spending boom of
the late 1980s reflects.
Now, with the Nikkei at half its end-1990 level, adjusted price/earnings
ratios for Japanese companies are below those of their US rivals. US
companies can now raise equity capital 1 percentage point more cheaply than
their Japanese rivals, according to Mattione.
The issue will be brought all the more forcibly home to Japanese companies
over the next few years because they must redeem many of the equity-linked
bonds which once looked so cheap. Because the stock market has performed so
poorly, these bonds will not now be converted into equity as their issuers
once confidently expected, but must be paid back. To do that, many Japanese
companies will have to raise capital at the new, higher rates.
It is not surprising that Japanese companies are placing a new emphasis on
profitability. Western competitors should restrain themselves from rejoicing
too loudly at their rivals' misfortune, however. Japanese companies have
shown an extraordinary ability to cope with unexpected shocks in the past.

FT  26 MAY 92 / More councils contract out services to private sector
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ADONIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN half of all local authorities have contracted out provision of at
least one of their main services to the private sector, and nearly a fifth
have three or more services contracted out, according to the Institute of
Public Finance.
Nearly one in five contracts awarded under the government's compulsory
competitive tendering policy has gone to the private sector. However, except
for refuse collection, its share is markedly lower in terms of value, with
private sector companies performing best in competition for smaller
contracts.
These findings come in a comprehensive report on the impact of competition
for local authority contracts published today by the IPF, a research arm of
the Chartered Institute of Public Finance and Accountancy. The report is
summarised in a special survey on compulsory competitive tendering in
today's Financial Times.
Contracts worth Pounds 1.9bn a year have been awarded since the government
obliged local authorities to start putting their main services out to tender
in 1988.
The first round of tendering for refuse collection, catering, street and
building cleaning, and grounds and vehicle maintenance, is almost complete.
Contracts start coming up for renewal in 1994.
The IPF study of 513 local authorities across Britain reveals that 214 have
contracted out none of their main services. But 143 have awarded one, or
part of one, service to the private sector, while 68 have contracted out two
and 91 - 18 per cent of the total - have contracted out three or more.
Private sector competition appears to be intensifying. In refuse collection
the proportion of contracts awarded to the private sector has risen from 14
per cent to 50 per cent since August 1990, in street cleaning from 10 per
cent to 50 per cent and in non-school and welfare catering from 10 per cent
to 50 per cent.

FT  26 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Lasmo
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's 10 per cent fall in Lasmo shares raises fresh questions about
the outlook for the group. Granted, the shares are still comfortably above
their recent low. It is conceivable that a sustained rise in the oil price
following the mildly optimistic Opec meeting will partially relieve the
pressure on Lasmo's finances. Small disposals such as last Friday's sale of
half of Lasmo Canada will bring in much-needed cash. Arguably, it will take
something rather more dramatic to reassure investors worried that the
dividend is likely to be cut this year.
The obvious solution would be the quick sale of the US and Canadian
downstream assets acquired with Ultramar. But a lack of trade buyers who can
afford such properties has forced Lasmo to prepare the more expensive route
of a flotation. The ability of that mechanism to deliver value for
shareholders has been widely questioned. Perhaps Lasmo should consider a
late change of tack.
The thrust of its attack on Ultramar was the strategic weakness of
integrated downstream and upstream oil companies. Ironically, it is the
Ultramar downstream assets which have recovered fastest. The issue of its
credibility aside, Lasmo could reasonably argue that it makes commercial
sense to sell the assets at a later point in the cycle. If it could retain
existing management, so much the better. Shareholders might not like it. But
they would scarcely object if the alternative is a further loss of value.

FT  26 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: UK utilities
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
However controversial the principles, the privatisation and regulation of
the UK's public utilities has been admired and even copied abroad.
Specifically, the notion that regulators should encourage competition and
efficiency, principally by controlling the prices charged by monopolies, is
seen as a welcome advance on the US system. The latter involves regulators
setting rates of return and then ensuring the utilities do not deviate. By
contrast, the UK model gives customers and competitors a clear idea of what
to expect, while allowing managers and shareholders alike to benefit from
genuine efficiency gains.
It is thus disturbing to perceive that UK regulators are in unwitting danger
of becoming more like their US counterparts. As Robert Fleming says, there
is a natural link between price-based and rate of return regulation. After
all, when a UK regulator sets a price cap, it assumes a judgment about the
underlying profitability of the company in question. That need not involve
an acceptance that the main basis of setting prices should be the rate of
return. But that is exactly what appears to have been happening.
Sir Bryan Carsberg's departure from Oftel could well be accompanied by an
agreement with BT on its inflation-linked price formula. The heart of the
debate, however, has not been the long-term effects of lower inflation on
the formula but BT's cost of capital, a benchmark for its rate of return. A
similar debate has begun in the water industry.
The main objection is not that rates of return are subject to arbitrary
judgments, although there is plenty to suggest that is the case. Rather, it
is that the implied approach is opposite to the original regulatory
intention of encouraging both competition and efficient management of
monopolies. Hapless investors might reasonably ask whether they should risk
a creeping change of such magnitude.

FT  26 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Private hopes in Paris
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Last week's surprise announcement that the French government plans to sell
most of its remaining stake in Total puts privatisation firmly back on the
financial markets' agenda. With FF2bn already in the kitty from Elf
Aquitaine, the FF8bn-FF10bn which might flow from lightening the state's
holding in a second oil company and the FF2bn-FF3bn expected from the sale
of a 24 per cent stake in the CNP life insurance company will take aggregate
privatisation proceeds this year well beyond the government's revised FF10bn
target (set just one month ago). The questions now are who will be next, and
what impact will the new paper have on equities and bonds?
The legendary vicar of Bray might well have been proud of the numerous
changes in French Socialist industrial policy over the past decade, which
have owed much to the triumph of pragmatism over principle. Mr Mitterrand's
famous ni-ni pledge, for example - neither nationalisation, nor
privatisation - has now clearly been modified through the government's
willingness to reduce its stake in some public companies to 51 per cent. The
speed with which this will be pursued in the short term will depend on the
success of the Total operation, and the extent to which asset sales rather
than a widening budget deficit are used to finance prime minister
Beregovoy's assault on unemployment in the run up to next year's poll.
Longer term, the prospect is for an ambitious privatisation programme of up
to FF300bn over the life of a government if the conservative parties are
elected, or a more modest one of perhaps FF50bn if the Socialists get back.
Total always looked a plausible choice given its healthy share price, its
appeal to international investors, and its status in the market as a
commercial rather than a state entity. Betting on the next candidates is
more tricky. The big insurers - UAP, GAN and AGF - are the favourites in
some quarters and enabling legislation permitting the government's stakes to
be reduced below 75 per cent will soon be in place.
A possible complication - as with some of the industrial companies which
expanded outside France in the second half of the 1980s - is that they may
want to keep too much of the new capital for themselves. Shearson Lehman
believes Rhone-Poulenc and Pechiney (with government stakes of 57 and 56 per
cent respectively) meet most of the criteria, although the former does not
have listed ordinary shares and the latter's restructuring is not yet
complete.
Since longer-run privatisation proceeds will be used mainly to repay debt,
the impact on French fixed-income markets hardly be negative. The shares of
those companies in line for partial privatisation should benefit as the
perception grows that state involvement will be cut, although the shares of
the insurers have already outperformed for this reason. As for the market as
a whole, much may depend on whether French investors can be persuaded to
load up with equities, given a reduced supply of bonds.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Letter: Economic liberals not believers in market
infallibility
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From PHILLIP OPPENHEIM MP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Joe Cryans is incorrect in his assertion that free marketeers believe
that markets are infallible (Letters, May 16). Rather, most economic
liberals consider that the aggregate of thousands, or millions, of free
choices of those most closely involved in economic decisions - consumers,
investors, businessmen etc - are rather less fallible than the edicts of
politicians and bureaucrats imposed from above.
Perhaps it would be helpful to remind Mr Cryans that during the 1970s the
development of London's Docklands, which he proposes as an example of market
failure, was largely in the hands of a committee of borough councils and the
Greater London Council, during which period precisely nothing was done.
Maybe, moreover, Mr Cryans should ponder the probability that most of the
unfortunate victims of the formerly centrally planned eastern bloc countries
would deem themselves more than fortunate if they enjoyed the housing, food
and income of the Los Angeles 'underclass' whose recent rioting he blames on
market economics.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Letter: Government unaware of dire state of manufacturing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LEON DI MARCO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, I should not have been surprised that in his speech to the
Confederation of British Industry ('Lamont vows to defeat inflation', May
20), the chancellor of the exchequer devoted less than one quarter of his
closely argued diatribe to address the problems of British industry.
It seems that the government has yet to learn that the state of
manufacturing industry is dire. Transparent misleading manipulation of
growth figures, using 1983 as a base, will not disguise the awful state
endemic in British industry.
A one and a half club industry policy will not help Britain in its
competitive struggle with the rest of the world. No amount of 'Pattenised'
Thatcherism will substitute for a progressive strategy to galvanise the
efforts of industry.
The Treasury may not yet have worked out the opportunity cost of the
property boom and bust to Britain. What is needed at the Treasury now is a
fourth secretary, together with the chief economic financial and economic
secretaries, in charge of day to day industry/Treasury co-ordination with
the DTI and the country.
It may be necessary to have a Plowden mark two with a wider remit, to
examine the whole recent performance of the Treasury with respect to the
British economy. Changes to farm out the disastrous forecasting job will not
be enough.
Macroeconomic policy is simply not a subtle enough tool to deal with the
complexities of modern industrial policy, when countries are active in
forwarding their own strategic industrial goals.
Any one deeply involved in manufacturing will recognise that the future is
outside Britain, and will continue to move their effort abroad under the
present regime.
There is no time to lose.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Letter: Clearing up tax question
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Ms STEPHANIE BRADLEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, May I help to clear up any uncertainty there may be about the tax
treatment of language lessons provided by an employer to an employee
(Letters, May 14 and May 18).
There is an Inland Revenue extra-statutory concession which can exempt
employees and directors from tax on the expenses incurred by employers in
providing external training courses. But the training must lead to the
acquisition of knowledge of skills which are either necessary for the duties
of the employee's current job or directly related to increasing
effectiveness in the performance of his or her present or prospective
duties.
This concession would apply to the majority of training undertaken by
employees who are learning languages for business purposes.
The full terms of the concession are set out in a free Inland Revenue
booklet, IRI, 'Extra-statutory concessions', available from any tax office.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Letter: Training as apprentice invaluable
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr RICHARD M TRIM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As one who is fortunate enough to have had a student apprenticeship in
electronic engineering, I found the article by Malcolm Craig (Personal View,
May 20) most interesting.
I agree entirely with his views concerning the adverse effects on British
industry of the decline in the availability of craft apprenticeships, but
suggest that the position is even more serious in relation to the reduction
in student and graduate apprenticeship opportunities.
My own student apprenticeship, which was with Cossor Electronics, was most
carefully planned and was overseen by a senior member of the research and
development laboratories, in which I was employed as an electronics
development engineer after my training.
As an apprentice, I spent periods in all of the manufacturing departments
and in the drawing office, the last year being spent in the marine radar
development laboratory. I eventually became technical director and,
latterly, joint deputy managing director.
Many of those now in senior positions in industry had the benefit of a
student or graduate apprenticeship - the excellent training which I received
during my student apprenticeship has been of the greatest benefit to me at
all stages in my career.
Perhaps this is a matter in which the Engineering Council should take an
interest.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Observer: Last ditch?
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Peripatetic Canadian-born currency economist Paul Chertkow, has surprised
even friends by his decision to ditch Citibank to join UBS in London as head
of global currency research, a newly created post.
True, he is well known not only for jumping off, but for landing on his
feet. In just over five years, his currency forecasts have dropped on
clients' desks from addresses as diverse as Hongkong Bank, Security Pacific
Hoare Govett, Drexels as well as, until a few days ago, Citi.
Even so, since that last move gave him a perch with the pre-eminent force in
global foreign exchange, the 44-year-old currency specialist had been
sounding as if he had at last found a home. Not so.
Now, with yet another new challenge accepted, he says he intends 'to retire
at UBS'. (Observer undertakes to remind him of that forecast if necessary).
'I've been paid well for quite a while,' he adds, explaining that the
breadth of the job, not money, was the decisive issue.
The arrival of Chertkow, no shrinking violet, may well put noses out of
joint. Already Malcolm Roberts, head of bond research, and chief UK
economist Bill Martin are not known for the harmony of their views. So
despite Chertkow's claims that they're all old and very good chums,
territory could be an issue.
While the new boy will no doubt rise above such things, it's a fair bet some
delicate egos will be jostling for attention soon. Perhaps it is fortunate
that the recent UBS edict, meant to stop equity analysts wasting time
talking to the press, doesn't extend to the economics department.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Observer: On the ball
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Is there method in the madness of Michael Knighton's switch from the board
of lofty football club Manchester United to ownership of lowly Carlisle
United?
The move might seem senseless given that besides being a tail-ender in the
Football League's division IV, or division III as it will be known next
season, Carlisle loses over Pounds 3,000 a week. But it is to become the
model for another Knighton venture, a sports consultancy called Centre
Forward.
He will be joint managing director of the consultancy with Simon Pitt, who
has produced two very gloomy reports about the financial state of football.
Indeed the latest survey - entitled The Bankrupting of English Football, and
putting the 92 clubs' combined debt at Pounds 150m - will be Centre
Forward's 'headline' publication.
Knighton, who made his money in property in the 1980s, paid Pounds 1m for
Carlisle United. It evidently has an interesting location.
There's also some evidence that he has a nose for a football bargain. He
came close to buying Manchester United for Pounds 20m three years ago. Its
flotation price last year valued it at nearly Pounds 47m and reaped about
Pounds 6m for Martin Edwards, the biggest shareholder, whom Knighton nearly
bought out.
Even at United's more recent market value of Pounds 34m, the increase is a
tidy one.

The bureaucratic bent for seeing problems in everything is apparently highly
developed in the Belgian civil service. When it introduced flexi-time
working, the worry arose about how to prevent jams in its entrance corridors
as late arrivals and early leavers tried to get past one another.
Eventually, the tidy official minds decided to have a white line painted
along the middle of each corridor, so dividing it into two lanes with
in-comers using one side and out-goers the other.
The project was dropped, however, before the paint had even been ordered. An
ad hoc survey showed that the late arrivals and the early leavers were the
selfsame people.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Observer: Shin-jinrui get itchy feet
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The urgent call put through to Yoshi Noguchi as head of a smallish US
company's branch in Japan, came from the young Japanese he'd just recruited
as sales manager from one of the country's best known groups. Regretfully,
the caller announced he wouldn't be taking up the job, adding by way of
explanation: 'I'm not married, you see.'
'That probably strikes you as meaningless,' says Noguchi five years later.
'But to a Japanese, it makes perfect sense. If you're ambitious, then as
well as the right credentials - approved kindergarten, schools, university
and so on - convention requires you to have the right sort of wife. You
simply won't be able to attract one unless you work for an organisation with
a famous name.'
It was impatience with such conventions that finally led Noguchi to divorce
himself from his native land and set up in Los Angeles as a headhunter with
the Paul Ray International executive-search firm. And he reckons that, while
most Japanese still prefer the established customs, a growing number of
managerial high-fliers are minded to follow suit.
'They're the new generation, the shin-jinrui who put making their own
fortune above serving their company even though it may employ them for life.
That traditionally means rising slowly to a senior job in the mainstream,
then being put out to grass in a subsidiary until you retire. The
conventional term for it is amakudari or 'descending from heaven', but the
young set call it iki-goroshi: 'being buried alive'.
'Besides,' Noguchi adds, 'with the recession, they've seen lots of their
elders being given, not amakudari but kata-tataki - the pat on the shoulder
that means 'Thanks for doing a good job, now clear your desk and go'.'

FT  26 MAY 92 / Letter: Rail should pay as well
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr THOMAS E WHITTLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your objective leader ('Privatisation plus for BR', May 19) is flawed
by your suggestion that road users should be charged 'social costs', or make
the use of railway tracks free.
It is difficult to obtain the true facts, but Malcolm Rifkind, former
transport secretary, said on TV that road users pay in taxes twice the
expenditure on roads. Presumably this does not include Vat, at least on
cars, servicing and spares. Other authorities have put road taxes at over
four times spending on roads.
The view seems to be that road taxes are a form of general taxation (third
after income tax and VAT) and do not relate to road expenditure. But all
vehicles, not least freight, pay very heavily for use of the roads. Rail
pays little or no tax and if the use of the track is to be free (a charge on
the taxpayer) then rail should pay comparable taxes to road. Thomas E

FT  26 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Contracting-out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
ONE light shines amid the wreckage of the Thatcher administration's local
government policy: the obligation placed on local authorities to put their
main services out to competitive tender.
The arguments for compulsory competitive tendering, strong to start with,
are virtually unassailable on any objective analysis of the impact of the
first round of tendering, now almost complete. It is not so much the success
of the private sector in competing for contracts, detailed in today's FT
survey of progress to date; nor only the evidence of large cost savings in
the provision of some services. Most valuable of all has been the effect of
contracting out in obliging local authorities to construct 'Chinese walls'
between their 'client' and 'contractor' functions. A premium has been placed
on performance and quality even where contracts have remained with in-house
labour forces.
Few friends of local government would wish to return to the status quo ante.
At the last general election the Labour party, which professes itself a boon
companion, proposed virtually to abolish compulsory tendering. Its readiness
to reverse that policy will be an early test of its ability to distance
itself from the immediate interests of the public-sector unions in the cause
of fair competition and the concerns of the consumer. Labour was to the fore
in promoting local citizen's charters and should never have allowed itself
to be left behind in the struggle to make public services efficient and
accountable. It will deserve to lose its position as the largest party in
local government if it cannot meet this particular challenge and make this
important change.
But if the government is serious in wishing to build bridges with local
government it will also need to shift focus in three ways. It will refrain
from interfering in the detail of how contracts are packaged; it will
clarify the law explicitly to allow local authority direct labour forces to
compete for out-of-area contracts where it is financially prudent for them
to do so; and it will ensure that a workable scheme is devised to spread
competition to local authority white-collar services.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Arts: Salome - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID MURRAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For this opera, there was a time when censors like the Lord Chamberlain
insisted that the head of John the Baptist be kept under decent wraps on its
salver, so that the squeamish might pretend that Salome was only making love
to the Sunday joint. Not any more: the prophet's severed head was my third
last week, after The Bacchae and Richard III. In Peter Hall's production,
revived at the Royal Opera by himself and Jeannette Aster, it is almost a
portrait-bust with gore.
Natural enough, for Michael Devlin's 'Jokanaan' is a visual apparition above
all: young, lithe and near-naked, gaunt and wild-eyed, precisely as
required. Just any old head later would never do. His lean baritone sounds
properly forceful on stage; it is not a very resonant voice, and the
electronic relay from his cistern doesn't flatter it. (A bit of re-miking
might make all the difference.) Also new to the production is Kenneth
Riegel's first-rate Herod, unerringly pointed and telling, with no campy
excess.
Some threadbare timbre near the end, as he pleads desperately with Salome to
choose some alternative prize, is no matter. One rarely gets a Herod of such
finesse. His Herodias is Gillian Knight, who booms sonorously but is made to
look too much a blatant cartoon to carry much baleful weight. Robin Leggate
repeats his sterling Narraboth, Fiona Kimm is a good Page (why not more
boyish, though?) and all the lesser roles are cannily filled.
About Maria Ewing's Salome there can be little argument. This is a hugely
fascinating portrayal, distinguished no less by its meaningful stillnesses
than by its largesse of psychological detail. Famously, when Strauss told
his prim first Salome that he wanted 'a 16-year-old princess with the voice
of an Isolde', she retorted that that was an 'either/or'. If the Ewing
soprano is not exactly an Isolde instrument, it soars confidently over the
orchestral waves in the final monologue.
The controversial vocal tricks that she likes to exploit are used here to
colour passages that aptly make one's skin creep. The physical embodiment is
superb (and her scorched-earth policy with her Seven Veils just as
sensational as it was in 1988), but at a level of intensity far above mere
sex-kitten stuff. In fact, the Ewing reading is severly consistent: her
teenage Salome is in the grip of an idealised fantasy of erotic love, so
private and self-contained that Jokanaan merely supplies an abstract target
for it.
The Seven Veils dance spells out obsessive yearning - sensibly not too
strenuous, in view of the monologue yet to come, but vividly apropos: even
her unashamed final pose looks like the climax of a secret dream, not a
public seduction. After that, I missed only a note of rising exacerbation in
her repeated 'The head of Jokaa-naa-an]' (Strauss has written it viciously
into the notes). Both earlier and later, there were places where I wished
that she could boast a thrilling pianissimo to match her more forward
effects. Yet she found a teasing lightness in places where Isolde-voices
never do.
Edward Downes conducts the score solidly, and paces it well. More thrilling
pianissimos from the pit would have been welcome too (especially at the
start), and the brass were inclined to bark rather than bite - Downes rarely
made Strauss's dynamic 'hair-pins' as sharp or as tense as they can be. Even
without the operatic screw tightened to the hilt, however, this Salome is a
remarkably potent affair.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Arts: American Buffalo - Theatre
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
David Mamet's 1975 American Buffalo is a hard gem of a play with a honed
edge. This production by the Film and Theatre Foundation at the Hen &amp;
Chickens Theatre, Islington, offers Mamet at his best: meticulously acted in
a small studio theatre.
Mamet is the Elmore Leonard of the stage: sharp and tough, with an exact ear
for urban dialogue. He knows contemporary urban America and writes in the
idiom of those at odds with their own lives and environment. His subjects
are the relations between people forced by circumstance to deal with
each other. His film, House of Games dealt with trust, and his 1981 rewrite
of The Postman Always Rings Twice with betrayal. American Buffalo prefigures
both.
Mamet starts by placing the action elsewhere and allowing its impact to
shape the situation on stage. Here, Don's Resale Shop is a clearing house
for fenced goods. Amongst its urban detritus a numismatist finds and buys a
rare Buffalo head nickel; Don has him followed, planning to steal his
collection. Bob, a junkie trading up to larceny, and Teach, a hardened
con-man and hustler, are in on the action.
As the robbery is plotted, the three men become mutually suspicious, and the
play erupts into extraordinary violence. So sit well back to avoid flying
shards of set, and be prepared for much swearing.
Mamet's text mixes subtlety and profanity. It demands and receives high
quality performances from Steve James, Richard Brake and Jack Panter,
showing how betrayals and compromises are made in the name of business,
'people taking care of themselves.' The characters are too stupid to reshape
their own lives, but too smart not to be discontented. They resort to
profundities which look like ironies: 'One thing makes all the difference in
the world it's knowin' what the fuck you're talkin' 'bout. It's rare.'
The insights are in the dialogue, like a Randy Newman song spoken out: 'You
OK on the meter?' - 'The broad came by already, she came by.' Even for the
con-men and hustlers, street life can be tough: 'Every day I go out there.
There is nothing out there.'
Jonathan Robinson directs. Recommended.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Arts: Aida - Opera
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Imagine a state banquet in colonial Egypt. The tables are lit by candelabra
and potted palms cast their shadow. The guests assemble dressed in full
ceremonial regalia and then the pre-dinner entertainment begins: a
slide-show featuring moments of glory from the recent war.
This is the triumph scene in Scottish Opera's production of Aida at the
Theatre Royal, Glasgow. One might have thought that such a wholesale
updating of the opera would have provoked an outcry when Gilbert Deflo's
production was first seen in 1987, but that was not the case. Instead the
public has been calling for its return and after five years the request has
been granted with this vivid and thoroughly lively revival, which opened on
Thursday.
As will have become clear by now, the raison d'etre of Deflo's setting is to
update the opera to Verdi's own time. This usefully does away with the need
for elephants, triumphal marches and the like, while still providing scenes
which are visually striking. But the production's success in finding late
19th-century equivalents for the ancient Egyptian settings has to be weighed
against the difficulty of creating afresh the social and political pressures
which Aida is all about.
It works best in and around the court. The princess Amneris is here the
daughter of a colonial governor. In the heat of the Egyptian afternoon she
takes tea with the other European women in a palatial white-and-gold
drawing-room. The snobbishness of this superior young society lady is there
to be seen and Sally Burgess plays her with devastating insight, catching
the cruelty and contempt as she amuses herself, callously playing with the
feelings of her black servant, Aida.
This is the individual performance that makes the whole evening work.
Although Sally Burgess is a long way from being the contralto that Verdi
wanted in the role, she prowls the stage memorably, a feline Amneris whose
every line spits with jealousy. Her prey this time is the warm and affecting
Aida of Priscilla Baskerville, not a consistent singer at this performance,
although at her best she gives some promise of becoming a Verdian in the
Arroyo mould.
Unfortunately the evening's Radames was ill. Stefano Algieri was reduced to
acting the role, while Geoffrey Shovelton sang from a stage box, an
arrangement that worked rather better than usual, as our singing Radames
came across strong and clear. Donnie Ray Albert was an Amonasro with just
enough voice and Frangiskos Voutsinos a not quite imposing Ramfis. John
Mauceri led a generally convincing musical performance, based on Verdi's
working score for the opera's first Paris production.
Where the show falls down is in the crucial relationship between church and
state, for Aida no less than Don Carlos has this theme at its heart and
Deflo has been unable to find any equivalent for the fearsome priests of
Isis, whose intransigence leads to the opera's tragic conclusion. Those
ranks of khaki-clad British officers, each man holding a candle and looking
a right lemon, are just not convincing as worshippers of the mighty Phtha.
The production is on tour until July 4

FT  26 MAY 92 / People: Ex-MP Maude to join Salomon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
After the disappointment of losing his Warwickshire North seat at the UK
general election last month, things have been looking up for Francis Maude,
38, former financial secretary to the Treasury.
First, he agreed to advise Hongkong and Shanghai Bank on its bid for Midland
Bank. Now he is to join Salomon Brothers, the American investment bank, as a
director of Corporate Finance at its London offices. He will continue as
consultant to HKSC until the bid for Midland is over.
At Salomon, Maude will be responsible for the bank's European privatisation
business. This will involve advising Salomon's clients in east and west
Europe on the financial and structural aspects of selling off state-owned
assets.
Salomon announced on Friday that Malev Hungarian Airlines is retaining its
services to advise it on the sale of a minority interest if a suitable
partner is found. Maude oversaw privatisation and competition policy in his
two years at the Treasury, including the launch of the share shop scheme
during the privatisation of British Telecom.
In fact, Maude would have been closely involved with the Treasury's decision
last September to drop Salomon in favour of Goldman Sachs as its US adviser
on the Pounds 5bn BT flotation because of allegations that Salomon traders
rigged US government securities auctions.
Announcing the appointment, William Strong, head of European Investment
Banking at Salomon, praised Maude for his 'broad international perspective'.
Before joining the Treasury where he also represented the UK at the European
Community, Maude was a minister of state at the Foreign Office with special
responsibility for Hong Kong and was involved in granting British passports
to 50,000 Hong Kong Chinese.

department. Eland, who is currently in charge of the Customs Anti-Smuggling
Division, will head a new central directorate bringing together the present
Single Market and Budget and Central Units, a new Economics and Statistics
Division, and the Tariff and Statistical Office.
After reading jurisprudence at Trinity College, Oxford, Eland joined Customs
and Excise in 1975 as a fast-stream trainee and has held various posts
within the department. Identified early as a man going to the top, he spent
seven years during the 1980s in the Cabinet Office, including a spell in the
Cabinet Secretariat.
He was private secretary to Lord Whitelaw when he was Lord President of the
Council 1987-88.
Smart money is on Valerie Strachan, one of the two deputy chairmen, to
succeed the present chairman Sir Brian Unwin who could well return to the
Treasury at some time in the next year. Eland would then be hotly fancied to
follow Strachan into the top seat.

</HEADLINE>

During the industrial revolution in Britain, families in Lancashire boosted
their income by producing cotton in their cellars. Now a small start-up firm
in Whalley, Lancashire is hoping to repeat the success of home working by
substituting desktop computers and sophisticated telecommunications
facilities for the hand-loom of the last century.
Based on the Scandinavian 'telecottage' concept, Anthony Capstick has set up
Ribble Tel-Business Trust with the backing of the East Lancashire Training
and Enterprise Council and the Rural Development Commission.
RTT hopes to create employment in the area by tendering for data entry work
from large international companies which will then be carried out by a
network of self-employed home workers.
However, its bread-and-butter business is providing basic office and
computer services like photocopying, printing, fax, personal telephone
answering, typing and computer hire by the hour for local businesses. If
required RTT will also provide one-to-one computer training at home - a
service tailor-made for shy businessmen.
From RTT's communications centre in Whalley, Capstick will also be offering
an online, high-speed search service through a company he has set up called
Instant Search, which he describes as 'a retail outlet for business
information held on computers'.
Using computer, telecommunications and fax facilities Instant Search can
provide corporate and business information from computer databases in the UK
and most overseas countries including the US within 10 minutes. Capstick
points out, somewhat surprisingly, that it is possible to dial more overseas
countries directly from Whalley than it is from Manhattan. Instant Search
operators capture information on their desktop terminals from computer
databases and convert it into a fax for delivery to clients. Capstick claims
customers can receive the information they require within minutes rather
than the hours or days taken by most conventional search agents.

silver - In A Nutshell
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Family businesses are not giving up the fight for further improvements on
inheritance tax. The Stoy Centre for Family Business has been lobbying
Norman Lamont, Chancellor of the Exchequer, to go beyond the changes made in
his 1992 Budget.
These allowed 100 per cent inheritance tax relief but only on shareholdings
of over 25 per cent of the equity share capital.
The SCFB has told Lamont that while this may help newly-established family
businesses, it will not help older firms, where individual shareholdings are
likely to fall below the threshold.
These shareholders will be entitled to only 50 per cent rather than 100 per
cent relief. SCFB reckons this discriminates against the businesses that the
Chancellor was trying to help.
The SCFB has suggested that if an individual owns shares in a family company
in which his or her family owns more than 50 per cent, then the full relief
should be applied.

Small businesses might not think themselves natural winners of the Booker

should think again. The same group of companies that has been rewarding
fiction writers is now doing the same for small businesses.
The Booker Prize for Excellence in Retailing and Catering is open to
businesses from restaurants to pubs, grocers and newsagents, all of which
face sharp competition from the multiples or big brewers.
The award, whose sponsors include Golden Wonder, Nestle and Bass, is worth
Pounds 27,000 in prize money, although the organisers stress that
consultancy advice is also offered to non-winning finalists.
All shortlisted candidates can expect to be visited unannounced by shoppers
and diners to make sure that customer service is as good as it is made out
to be on the entrance form.

This was the warning given by Sir Peter Walters, chairman of Midland Bank,

'Long-term prosperity demands that as many of the business's costs as

FT  26 MAY 92 / Management (The Growing Business): Paying more than a pony -
Jane Fuller interrogates the banks about their high charges, and advises
small firms to shop around
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Lloyds Bank's attempt to woo small companies as part of its proposed bid for
Midland focused on start-up businesses and on access to funds at favourable
rates.
But for the bulk of existing small firms, the promises must have sounded a
little hollow. One of their main concerns was not addressed: what about the
cost of everyday transactions?
A quarterly bill from a bank can add up to a considerable amount, much of it
charged for paying money in rather than taking it out.
Take the case of a riding school on the outskirts of London, turning over
more than Pounds 100,000 a year. Customers are charged Pounds 13.50 for an
hour's riding and often pay by cheque.
For the first three months of the year, the charges made by a local branch
of Barclays Bank amounted to Pounds 401.79. As this would be for a
comparatively quiet winter quarter, the annual banking fee would be well
over Pounds 1,200 - more than 1 per cent of turnover. This is before
charging any interest on an overdraft.
The bill was itemised following a query from the customer and a list of
imminent tariff increases was also sent to her. The main points that raised
her eyebrows were the amounts charged for paying in cheques and cash, fees
for letters and other pieces of administration, and several price rises at
rather more than the inflation rate.
A breakdown of the charges shows that by far the largest item was Pounds
210.34 for paying in 809 cheques, at 26p per cheque. From next month the
charge goes up to 29p, an increase of 11.5 per cent compared with the latest
UK inflation figure of 4.3 per cent. The second largest item on the bill was
Pounds 89 for 'management and overdraft administration fees', which were not
explained.
Two other key points in the tariff information were an increase from 65p to
70p for every Pounds 100 cash paid in and from 57p to 61p for debits,
increases of 7 to 8 per cent.
The business is responding to the main problem of cheque charges in three
ways:
Passing on a 30p charge to the customer writing a cheque for less than
Pounds 50. A copy of the bank charges will be pinned to the notice board to
show the reason.
Offering blocks of lessons at a discount to reduce the number of cheques.
By-passing the bank altogether. The 30p cheque charge will encourage more
customers to pay cash, which will then be used to pay suppliers directly.
The last line of action sounds like regressive behaviour. It raises issues
of security and loss of business for the bank.
To try to find out whether the charges were typical, the FT asked the four
other high street banks for comparative figures.
The answers showed some variations in the amounts charged, but to a small
business all might seem expensive. However, each bank also said that fees
were negotiable. 'If the customer is not happy, they should go to see their
bank manager,' was a common response, although they would need to ask
whether, and how much, they might be charged for the appointment.
Taking cheques paid in, cash paid in and debits, the cheapest was Midland
Bank, echoing the findings of Rochester Research's recent survey of bank
branches in Kent, which ranked Barclays as the next cheapest followed by
NatWest, with LLoyds as the most expensive.
Midland's charges per cheque were 23p and 60p for a single credit comprising
a number of cheques. Had the riding school qualified for Barclays small
business tariffs, for which the cut-off is Pounds 100,000 turnover, a bundle
of cheques could have been banked for 66p.
At NatWest, which has a similar Pounds 100,000 limit for its small business
service, the charge is 64p for every payment into or out of the account.
Over this threshold, it said 'all charges are individually negotiated',
taking into account the level of activity. One option was to negotiate
charges as a percentage of turnover.
The TSB Bank was close to Midland at 25p per cheque and 67p per multi-cheque
credit, and only 1p behind Midland's 52p for debits. Lloyds was the most
expensive at 75p per credit or debit entry. However, its 'small business'
tariffs applied to companies with up to Pounds 1m turnover, and the 75p was
a flat rate for any amount of cash, rather than per Pounds 100. Both these
factors would help in the riding school's case.
Midland also fared best in terms of modest increases. It raised its charges
in March last year and has decided not to put them up again until March
1993. All the other banks either have raised charges by more than the
inflation rate or plan to do so.
The explanation Barclays offered for this was that it was 'a known fact'
that service inflation was higher than 'normal' inflation. Asked why, the
response was: 'Without being an economist, I don't want to give a detailed
explanation.'
If the main reason is staff costs, then Lloyds' aim to save Pounds 700m over
four years partly through cutting up to 20,000 jobs lends some credence to
its claim that small businesses would benefit. However, with the exception
of specific offers to new businesses and for certain types of borrowing, it
talks of 'better products and services' rather than cuts in charges.
Stuart White, enterprise director at Midland, explained why a bank might
switch from charging a flat rate for a bundle of cheques to charging for
each one. 'Where there is a high volume, you may look at how much it costs
to process the paper.'
He also expressed some dismay at the prospect of a business switching back
to cash. 'Through the 1980s we moved towards the cashless society but now
there is a danger we could end up as a cash-only society. I would like to
see that avoided.'
His advice for a business like the riding school was to reduce the level of
banking activity - 'don't collect as many cheques'. And it was worth asking
the bank 'to ensure that charges came out at a minimum', he said.
Midland offered to provide its customers with costings to show that it was
trying 'to get the costs back plus a bit of profit for ourselves'.
The banks were also asked about the help they offered to the small business
customer. Some of the answers focused either on free banking for new
businesses in their first year (Lloyds is proposing two years if the merger
comes off). Others concentrated on support for businesses that were running
into difficulties - obviously a preoccupation when the high street banks
have had to make heavy provisions for bad debts.
This perhaps explains why that 'bit of profit' earned from businesses that
are neither new nor ailing is so important, and why charges are tending to
outstrip inflation.

FT  26 MAY 92 / UK Council Services: Independents push for innovation
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN WILLMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE forefront of the contracting-out revolution in local government is
East Cambridgeshire, a small district council whose councillors claim a
proud record of innovation.
The council, which is controlled by independents, was the first to contract
out the preparation of its district plan to consultants - including
responsibility for the extensive public consultation process and responding
to objections at the inquiry.
It was also the first council to contract out tax collectionand the payment
of benefits under a five-year arrangement that offers incentives for prompt
collection of poll tax.
The council has restructured itself around a core organisation dedicated to
purchasing services and ensuring that they come up to standard. The services
themselves will be provided under contract by a variety of organisations -
including, in some cases, the council's own staff.
Serving just 62,000 people from the cathedral city of Ely, East
Cambridgeshire contracts out services such as housing maintenance and pest
control. The council's housing stock is about to be transferred to a housing
association following a vote by the tenants.
But the council has decided to go much further in contracting out so that
almost any part of its operations could be put out to tender.
A 'client core' of senior officers has been created to handle the
contracting-out process. The most important roles of the core are to draw up
the specifications for the contracts and monitor performance.
The rest of the council's staff have been reorganised into budget centres
which will contract with the core to provide specific services. An
increasing share of those services will be bought in from the private
sector, so that the council itself will become less involved in direct
service provision.
Mr Trevor Hardy, East Cambridgeshire chief executive, is evangelical about
the council's approach. 'The only criterion is whether change produces
benefits for the people of East Cambridgeshire,' he says.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Kurdish vote leads to show of unity: Political leaders
bargained over post-election deals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   DAHUK

<TEXT>
IRAQI KURDISTAN'S first free elections reached almost farcical levels even
before the ballot papers were counted.
It was never going to be perfect. There was no electoral register - hence
the importance of marking-ink to prevent people voting more than once -
because of the dislocation of Iraqi society.
The Iran-Iraq war of 1980-88 was fought partly on Kurdish soil and
culminated in the Iraqi government's use of chemical weapons against
Peshmerga guerrillas and civilians. Thousands of villages were razed and
perhaps as many as 180,000 civilians 'disappeared' in the late 1980s during
a pogrom by Iraqi President Saddam Hussein.
Then in 1991 thousands of Kurds fled to the mountains as Saddam regained
strength after being driven out of Kuwait by the western allies.
Against this backdrop, widows, orphans, refugee families and
Kalashnikov-bearing guerrillas queued on May 19 to place their mark on
ballot papers bearing the coloured flags of the Kurdish parties.
Between the close of polling at midnight and the broadcast outcome on
Friday, politicians bargained over post-election deals in return for
accepting the propriety of the poll.
Occasionally they called in judge Amier Hawesy, a stern-faced relic from the
days of rule from Baghdad and now the 'neutral' head of the electoral
commission. When he gave reporters the figures for seats in the new
assembly, he was genuinely surprised to be asked for numbers of votes.
The Kurds voted against Saddam and for peace. It was less important that Mr
Massoud Barzani's Kurdistan Democatic party (KDP) was eventually put at 45.4
per cent and Mr Jalal Talabani's Patriotic Union of Kurdistan (PUK) at 43.9
per cent in the assembly elections - or that Mr Barzani was ahead by a
slightly larger margin in an election for president, which failed to achieve
a definite outcome as no-one reached 50 per cent.
The KDP forfeited a two-seat lead over the PUK, giving away one seat to its
rival to make them level. The need for unity was greater than the desire for
victory.
Even the small parties, none of which reached the 7 per cent threshold for
representation, would be included in the assembly's executive.
Emerging arm-in-arm from the crucial summit at Shaklawa on Friday, Mr
Barzani and Mr Talabani verged on the theatrical. But the ostensible
political differences between the KDP's 'autonomy' and the PUK's
'self-determination with Iraq' were exaggerated for election purposes.
There is a shared appreciation of the considerable problems facing the new
administration created to fill the vacuum left by Mr Saddam's withdrawal
from the region.
Inflation has been rampant. A day's work in the fields is needed to buy a
kilo of rice or a can of Turkish beer; two weeks' work will buy a pair of
good shoes. While basic requirements filter through the UN embargo on Iraq
and the Iraqi embargo on Kurdistan, there are widespread shortages.
Saddam has a 100,000-strong army just south of Kurdish-held territory. The
debris of burnt-out Iraqi heavy armour littering the road north of
Salahuddin is evidence of guerrilla prowess with anti-tank weapons, but
defence against helicopter gunships would rely on the allied air cover
operating north of the 36th parallel from the Incerlik Nato base in
south-east Turkey.
An autonomous Iraqi Kurdistan is land-locked and without regional allies.
The Kurdish leadership eagerly seizes on any hint that the US, Turkey or
Iran are becoming more supportive.
As the election fuels Kurdish aspirations in Turkey and Iran, KDP and PUK
leaders are expected to attend next month's Vienna conference of the various
Iraqi opposition groupings: this, they hope, will please the US.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Plans to curb Thai military: Parliament votes to amend
constitution as Suchinda is forced out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE THAI parliament moved hurriedly yesterday to amend the country's
constitution, reducing the influence of the armed forces, after the weekend
resignation of the prime minister, General Suchinda Kraprayoon. He was
forced to quit over the killing of at least 46 pro-democracy demonstrators
by troops last week.
The amendments meet the demands of the opposition by requiring the prime
minister to be an elected member of parliament, reducing the powers of the
military-appointed senate, making the speaker of the elected house of
representatives the parliament's president, and providing for two full
sessions of the parliament each year instead of one.
Gen Suchinda, the former supreme military commander, overthrew the elected
government last year. He was chosen by the five pro-military parties which
formed a government after elections in March. His whereabouts were unknown
last night.
Parliament yesterday passed the first reading of the amendment bill by 533
votes to nil, with nine absentions, and the second reading by a show of
hands. The third and final reading is due on June 10.
Although the vote was a victory for the pro-democracy movement, several
issues arising from last week's violence have yet to be resolved.
Opponents of the government are seeking to overturn an amnesty decreed by
Gen Suchinda shortly before he resigned, because it covers not only the
arrested demonstrators but also those responsible for the shooting of
unarmed protesters.
Pro-democracy activists are insisting that Gen Suchinda and his colleagues
and relatives in the armed forces be tried for the action they took to
suppress the demonstrations. Hundreds of protesters gathered outside the
parliament during yesterday's debate, chanting 'Where are the killers?'
Air Chief Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the supreme military commander, and Gen
Issarapong Noonpakdee, the army chief and Gen Suchinda's brother-in-law,
were among those who failed to appear for the parliamentary session in their
capacity as senators.
Another unresolved issue is the identity of the new prime minister.
Pro-democracy demonstrators are angry not merely with the military
establishment but also with the government politicians who allowed the
generals to do as they pleased last week.
It is possible that the five-party governing coalition will collapse, paving
the way for a prime ministerial candidate from one of the parties now in
opposition.

TAIWAN'S parliament has passed revisions to its copyright law, strengthening
protection of foreign patents and copyrights in a bid to avert US trade
sanctions, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The new law, passed last week, gives explicit legal protection to a wide
range of products, including Chinese translations of English-language
publications, computer software, and films and music recorded on laser
discs.
It imposes heavier penalties for copyright piracy. Violators now face
seven-year prison terms and fines of up to Dollars 18,000 (Pounds 10,000),
and victims of infringements can seek up to Dollars 40,000 in damages.
Intellectual property talks between Taipei and Washington broke down last
month and the US trade representative placed Taiwan on a 'priority watch
list' of countries failing to prevent piracy of US copyrights.
It could face trade retaliation, including tariffs of up to 100 per cent on
some of its shipments, unless it satisfies Washington within six months that
it has made progress towards stopping piracy.
A US industry group has estimated intellectual property theft costs American
companies Dollars 370m a year in Taiwan.
The revisions will also help Taiwan's application to join the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, legislators said.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Misleading messages from monetary aggregates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDWARD BALLS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A POPULAR myth peddled by so-called 'post-Keynesian' economists argues that
the trade-off between unemployment and inflation - if it ever existed - has
disappeared. But for monetary policy-makers, this trade-off is very much
alive. Too great an easing of monetary policy by the US Federal Reserve may
yet turn a sluggish recovery into rapid growth and accelerating inflation.
The Bank of Japan has faced the opposite risk: too little, too late may have
already transformed a gentle slowdown into a western-style deflation.
The job of these monetary policy-makers is tricky because of the very long
and unpredictable lags between changes in interest rates and their effect on
economic activity. But policy is doubly difficult to judge at present
because of the erratic behaviour of the central bankers' favoured leading
indicators of future inflation: the growth of broad monetary aggregates.
In the US, the narrow monetary aggregate labelled M1 - mainly notes, coins
and non-interest bearing current accounts - has accelerated rapidly over the
past six months. Yet broad money (M2), which also includes a variety of
interest-bearing time deposits, is still growing very slowly, and is barely
above the lower limit of the Fed's 2.5-6.5 per cent growth target. Whatever
his misgivings, Mr Alan Greenspan, the Fed chairman, will find it hard to
resist administration pressure to cut rates before this autumn's
presidential election.
Yet broad money growth may be misleadingly depressed. The federal
government, via the Resolution Trust Company, has been issuing Treasury
bills which do not appear in M2 and simultaneously writing off thrift
deposits which were included. Meanwhile, loose monetary policy may
perversely be depressing monetary growth. Low short-term interest rates may
have persuaded small investors to withdraw savings from time deposits and
invest them at longer maturities, where the yields are higher. Stripping out
small time deposits and money market mutual funds from M2 raises its growth
rate to M1 proportions, as the left-hand charts shows.
The Bank of Japan faces similar difficulties. While M1 growth remains at
historically high levels, the growth of its favoured money supply average -
M2 plus certificates of deposit - has collapsed. The BOJ, anxious to resist
another interest rate cut, argues that this slowdown results from shift of
savings into Postal Saving deposits which are excluded from broad money. But
growth of both bank lending and broad liquidity, which includes the postal
savings, is also sluggish.
In Germany, broad money growth rates suggest that inflation, not recession,
remains the main threat. The year-on-year growth rates have risen sharply in
recent months. But the peculiar measure of broad money growth rates stressed
by the Bundesbank paints a more alarming picture. Its target range for M3
growth of 3 1/2 -5 1/2 per cent in 1992 refers to growth relative to the
average level of M3 in the fourth quarter of 1991. Rapid money growth in
December and January meant that the annualised monthly rate was already 8.9
per cent in January. It has since remained outside the target range.
There are a number of reasons why German broad money growth might be
artificially inflated. The growing use of the D-Mark as a reserve currency
in eastern Europe is one possibility; another is the large negative
differential between short and long interest rates - the opposite from the
US where this yield ratio is positive - which may be encouraging investors
to shift into short-term assets.
Yet the main force propelling M3 growth, according to the Bundesbank, is the
volume of bank lending to companies and individuals. The April money supply
figures show a strong rise in short term lending which may, according to Mr
Paul Brunker of Robert Fleming Securities, reflect 'distress' financing by
companies facing a slowing economy. But M3 growth is not expected to fall
within the Bundesbank's target range in 1992. Until it does, a significant
cut in German interest rates is unlikely, while the risk of a German
recession will remain.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Mexico growth forecast cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAMIAN FRASER

<DATELINE>
   MEXICO CITY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT Carlos Salinas de Gortari has said Mexico's economic growth is
likely to be just 3 per cent this year, compared to the official government
forecast of 4 per cent.
The remark confirms what many private sector analysts and the recent
lacklustre performance of the stock market had already indicated: economic
growth, sluggish in the second half of last year, has continued to slow this
year. The president blamed the slowdown on the 'international situation'
(the weakness of the US economy), although the government's tight budget and
steady real appreciation of the peso-dollar exchange rate will have played
their part.
The slower growth has yet to have an appreciable impact on the trade
deficit, which reached a record Dollars 1.435bn (Pounds 810m), excluding
revenues from the maquiladora or in-bond plants, in March, against Dollars
1.38bn in February. The cumulative deficit for the first three months of the
year is now Dollars 4bn, much too high for the government to meet its
forecast of a current account deficit of Dollars 12.99bn for 1992.
The deficit including revenues from the maquiladoras reached Dollars 1.05bn.
To complete an uncomfortable picture the government has had much less
success in reducing inflation than it hoped. Inflation in the first four
months was 5 per cent.

<TEXT>
THE European Commission intends to release about Ecu1bn (Pounds 700m) of
soft loans to encourage small and medium-sized companies to get involved in
EC research projects over the next five years.
Mr Filippo Maria Pandolfi, EC research commissioner, yesterday fleshed out
plans to provide venture capital for smaller businesses as part of the EC's
fourth framework programme for research and development.
The Commission would like approval for an increase in total research funding
from Ecu2.4bn to Ecu4.2bn in 1997, concentrated on certain key technologies.
Mr Pandolfi said funding for 1993-97 should also include Ecu100m of funds to
underpin low-interest loans from financial institutions.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Austria prepares for political fall-out after poll: The
presidential election which started with a whimper and ended with a bang
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Austrian presidential elections started with a whimper and ended with a
bang.
A campaign devoid of controversy resulted in a political earthquake at the
weekend when Mr Thomas Klestil of the conservative People's party defeated
his Social Democratic opponent, Mr Rudolf Streicher, with the largest margin
ever.
Mr Klestil, a career diplomat, scored 56.85 per cent in the run-off against
43.15 per cent for Mr Streicher. Mr Klestil swept all nine federal states,
including the city of Vienna, a traditional socialist stronghold.
The outcome of the vote is a big setback for Chancellor Franz Vranitzky's
Social Democratic party, which had counted on an easy victory when it
nominated a hesitant Mr Streicher, the popular minister of transportation,
as its candidate for the largely ceremonial post.
Mr Streicher was still ahead of Mr Klestil by a narrow margin in the first
round of voting on April 26, but in the following weeks his campaign petered
out. In contrast to the Social Democrat's lacklustre performance, a spirited
Mr Klestil flourished on the campaign trail and managed to present himself
as the candidate who was above party ties.
The failure of Mr Streicher to mobilise the Social Democratic party base
points to structural problems in the leftist camp - the vote was largely a
triumph of image over traditional party loyalties. According to surveys,
voters believed that Mr Klestil, a former ambassador to the United Nations
and US, would be best suited to repair Austria's relations with many western
countries following the damage of Mr Kurt Waldheim's six-year term in
office.
Mr Waldheim had been shunned by the US and many EC countries following
allegations that he lied about his activities as a German officer during the
Second World War. Mr Klestil is planning a sweep through all leading western
capitals to improve Austria's image and boost its chances for EC membership.
The election result is not likely to have an immediate effect on the grand
coalition between the Social Democrats and the People's party, but the
long-term fall-out could be substantial. Mr Klestil's victory has given a
much-needed boost to the People's party, which had suffered a string of
embarrassing losses at the hands of the right-wing Freedom party and its
populist leader, Mr Jorg Haider.
Mr Haider gave a qualified endorsement to Mr Klestil after his own candidate
was placed a distant third in the first round, fuelling speculation after
the poll that the election could lay the ground for a coalition between the
two conservative parties.
Erhard Busek, chairman of the People's party, remains a stalwart supporter
of a grand coalition. His hand has been strengthened by the performance of
his candidate.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Western donors cement links with CIS states: Lisbon
conference moves beyond emergency aid
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, PATRICK BLUM and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LISBON, KUALA LUMPUR
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE first formal meeting between the Commonwealth of Independent States
(CIS) and a broad coalition of western donors has laid the foundations for a
new, long-term economic partnership.
For the first time foreign ministers of the 12 post-Soviet independent
states put forward their hopes and needs directly to officials from more
than 60 donor states and a dozen international institutions during a
European Community-sponsored conference in Lisbon.
The presence in town of representatives from the three warring factions of
Bosnian Serbs, Croats and Moslems further underlined the scope for violent
regional disintegration, evident in the dispute between Armenia and
Azerbaijan over Nagorno-Karabakh. Russia, which in Czarist times saw itself
as protector of the Serbs, is now working closely with the US and the EC to
try to end the Bosnian fighting.
Mr Andrei Kozyrev, Russian foreign minister, left for Belgrade and Sarajevo
after an intensive series of bilateral meetings and the signing on Saturday
night of a strategic arms reduction (Start) protocol with the US and the
three other nuclear CIS states - Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.
The EC, US, Japan and Russia also initialled an agreement to set up an
international science and technology centre. This is expected to provide
employment for former Soviet nuclear weapons specialists and concentrate on
ways to reduce nuclear pollution.
Until now, aid to the former Soviet states has been extended on an emergency
basis under plans agreed in Washington last January to avert the perceived
risk of famine and chaos. At that time the emphasis was on emergency food
and medical assistance in the form of demonstrative support for the new
governments.
With maximum publicity the EC and the US sent aircraft laden largely with EC
surplus foodstuffs and supplies left over from the Gulf war to selected
cities.
Psychologically the aid effort appears to have been a success, although in
practical terms the aid delivered was small and most of the Dollars 86bn
(Pounds 48.5bn) pledged by governments and institutions remains on paper.
The Lisbon conference sought to move beyond emergency aid to discuss
channelling funds and expertise in a co-ordinated fashion, designed to help
recipients increase their capacity to absorb aid effectively. A third
meeting will take place in Tokyo in the autumn to refine further the
bilateral and multilateral aid programmes.
The potential for building a mutually beneficial partnership was underlined
by Mr Michel Camdessus, managing director of the International Monetary
Fund. He calculated that if growth in eastern Europe and the former Soviet
Union reached 4 per cent in the medium term, 1.8 percentage points would be
added to world economic growth.
But Mr Camdessus emphasised steady growth would not be achieved without
'bold and comprehensive' action by recipient countries to build a new legal
framework for private enterprise and privatisation.
Much of the credit for the more confident tone of the Lisbon meeting is
attributable to the speed with which the former Soviet states have been
accepted into the IMF, the World Bank and other international financial
institutions.
The IMF alone expects to provide Dollars 25bn-Dollars 30bn to the 15 states
over the next four to five years. But its main contribution will be in
provision of expertise in areas like central banking and monetary policy,
tax and budget reforms, financial statistics and macro-economic guidance.
The way in which the Bretton Woods institutions and the newly created
European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD) have assumed the
main burden of both technical and financial assistance since the original
Washington conference has reduced a potential conflict between the European
Community and the US over who should provide 'leadership' during the
traumatic period of transition.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, emphasised the global nature of the
coalition now being formed to help the former Soviet states. He praised
Venezuela and spoke of the way the US was developing a close partnership
with Turkey 'to promote free markets and democracy in the Caucasus and
central Asia'.
Japan also underlined its special interest in the development of the central
Asian republics. Whether Tokyo uses the tentatively scheduled October
follow-up conference to raise its relatively modest Dollars 2.5bn aid
contribution, however, largely depends on whether Russia and Japan can
resolve their long-standing dispute over sovereignty of the Kuril islands.
THE World Bank will lend Dollars 1.5bn (Pounds 840m) to the Commonwealth of
Independent States (CIS) this year for industrial development, a senior bank
official said yesterday, Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
Mr Peter Nore, head of the gas and oil group in the management assistance
programme of the World Bank's energy sector, said conditions would be
attached to the funds but he declined to elaborate.  The CIS joined the
World Bank last month.
Mr Nore, who is attending a conference on liquefied natural gas in Malaysia,
said part of the money would be used to develop the CIS oil and gas sectors.
He said the 15 former Soviet republics were desperate for capital to replace
equipment in the oil and gas sectors, although gas production had not fallen
after the break-up of the Soviet Union.

FT  26 MAY 92 / Kosovo elections raise risk of conflict
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ETHNIC Albanian leaders of the southern Serbian province of Kosovo were
forming a breakaway parliament yesterday following weekend elections,
branded illegal by Belgrade.
Mr Ibrahim Rugova, the newly-elected president, who was also the only
candidate, said the polls were a 'chance to create democratic institutions
which have legitimacy in Kosovo and on an international level'.
The elections have raised the spectre of war in the province. Any violence
there is likely to spill over into Moslem areas of southern Serbia,
independence-seeking Macedonia, inhabited by some 700,000 Albanians, and
into neighbouring Albania.
Kosovo's 1.9m Albanians fear sharing the fate of Croatia and Bosnia, where
armed struggles with the Serb-led army have left thousands dead and 1m
people displaced. They appear to be heeding the call of Mr Rugova to seek
independence through non-violent means.
Serbia flatly rejects any discussion of independence for Kosovo. Serbs see
the province, which is the seat of the Orthodox church, as the cradle of
their civilisation.
Mr Slobodan Milosevic, president of Serbia, stripped Kosovo of its autonomy
in 1989 and used the 'plight' of the province's Serbs, outnumbered 10 to
one, to ride to power on a nationalist wave.
Scores of Albanians were killed three years ago when Serbian police crushed
rallies protesting against direct rule by Belgrade.
Since 1990 Serbia has dissolved the province's parliament and sacked more
than 85,000 doctors, teachers and workers for refusing to sign a loyalty
oath. Serbs now control Kosovo's police, media, hospitals and hotels.
Schools have been segregated.
Human rights officials say some 250,000 Albanian pupils did not attend
school this year.
