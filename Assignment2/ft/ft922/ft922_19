<TEXT>
The Italian lira had a bad week in the Exchange Rate Mechanism, slipping
back two places and ending second from bottom. Italy's political
uncertainties have drained confidence in the lira, and there is speculation
about an Italian devaluation. The French franc remained the star performer,
nudging its central rate against the D-Mark to FFr3.3539. Sterling dropped
to third from bottom of the grid on the back of mixed UK economic indicators
 -but dealers believe the pound's steady uptrend against the D-Mark is
intact, and that it could breach DM2.94 again this week.

FT  23 MAY 92 / BBC to move up-market as Birt strategy wins approval
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN BIRT, deputy director general of the BBC, has won agreement for his
strategy to redefine the programme output of the corporation and take it
up-market.
The aim is to ensure the BBC provides something unique for its audience and
does not compete head on with ITV and the growing number of satellite
channels.
The decision was taken at this week's conference of the BBC's governors and
top management at Lucknam Park hotel near Bath which ended yesterday.
The approval for the general overall strategy will have potentially radical
implications for many parts of the corporation from light entertainment
television to Radios 1 and 2.
The governors have not decided to turn the BBC into an elitist broadcasting
ghetto producing only worthy and serious programmes. All present programme
types including comedy, popular drama and soap operas will continue. In
comedy there will be greater emphasis on Victoria Wood, say, than Les
Dawson.
The future strategy of the BBC will be to justify the continuation of the
licence fee by offering something to all sections of society while
emphasising the corporation's distinctive public service role. The
conference set the strategy but did not take specific decisions on whether
Radio 5 is to survive. Detailed policy proposals will be drawn up between
now and the autumn.
At a dinner on Thursday evening, Mr David Mellor, national heritage
secretary, said he planned to publish a green paper in September. The BBC
intends to wait until it has been published and its contents absorbed before
coming up with a detailed blueprint for its own future.
The BBC's Royal Charter runs out at the end of 1996.

FT  23 MAY 92 / US and EC prepare Serbian sanctions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL LITTLEJOHNS and LAURA SILBER
</BYLINE>

   NEW YORK, BELGRADE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US and the European Community were yesterday preparing to adopt
diplomatic and economic sanctions to force Serbia to end ethnic fighting in
the breakaway Yugoslav republic of Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The Serb-led federal Yugoslav army, meanwhile, was reported to have agreed
to withdraw from its barracks in the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo. The federal
troops, who have been pinned down at their bases by Moslem gunfire, are to
begin the pull-out today, according to the official Belgrade-based
newsagency, Tanjug.
In a memorandum sent to EC governments, the US said it was 'appalled by the
actions of the Yugoslav national army and the Serbian leadership in
Belgrade'. It would therefore shortly expel Yugoslav military attaches from
Washington and close two Yugoslav consulates, a measure matched by the
withdrawal of Washington's own military attaches and the closure of two US
consulates in Yugoslavia.
These moves follow the recall of all EC ambassadors from the Serbian capital
and US termination this week of landing rights for JAT, the Yugoslav state
airline now run by Serbia and its ally Montenegro.
Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, discussed the Yugoslav crisis with Mr
John Major, Britain's prime minister, in London last night. The US hoped for
co-ordinated action by countries 'unwilling to sit back and watch what
really is a humanitarian nightmare taking place', Mr Baker said.
Mr Gianni de Michelis, Italy's foreign minister, said the EC would approve
further economic sanctions against Serbia 'in a matter of hours or days' and
diplomatic pressures could eventually lead to Belgrade's exclusion from the
UN.
In a report to be discussed by EC foreign ministers in Lisbon at the
weekend, the European Commission recommended an embargo on Serbian and
Montenegrin exports and freezing of the extinct Yugoslav federation's IMF
assets.
Emphasising that more than half of Serbian and Montenegrin exports in 1991
went to the EC, the report said an EC embargo would have a big impact even
if not backed by Serbia's other trading partners.
The report was much more pessimistic, however, about the likely impact of an
oil embargo. Such an embargo would have to be supported by the two
republics' leading suppliers - Russia, China, Iran and Romania.
The extent of Belgrade's isolation was underlined by admission to the UN
yesterday of the three former Yugoslav republics of Croatia, Slovenia and
Bosnia-Hercegovina.
The UN agency for refugees said yesterday it was suspending operations in
Bosnia, until it got Serb assurances that it could conduct its work without
hindrance and in safety. This follows the seizure by Serb irregulars of 12
UN relief trucks.
Meanwhile, Germany opened its frontiers to children and sick and wounded
from Bosnia-Hercegovina, and urged other western European countries to
accept more refugees.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Ticket discounts take centre stage: London's West End
theatre managers seek to woo a wider audience

<DATELINE>
   THE QUESTION every full-fare airline passenger dreads
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
how much did you pay for your ticket? - could soon echo in London's
theatres. Ticket discounting has moved centre stage as West End theatre
managers try to woo a wider audience.
More than one in five theatregoers already pays less than the face value of
tickets, according to a recent survey by the Society of West End Theatres
(Swet).
The trend is likely to accelerate. American Airlines has offered to develop
software for Swet based on its own booking system. It would include a
variety of discounts on tickets to encourage the non-theatregoer. Theatre
box offices and ticket agencies have already installed computerised booking
systems, promotional packages are targeting reluctant spectators and a
bigger variety of ticket discounts is being offered.
While the most popular shows, such as Phantom of the Opera and Miss Saigon,
continue to attract the attention of touts, most theatres find it difficult
to fill performances.
'Discounting has definitely become more prominent,' says Ms Susan
Whiddington, development officer at Swet. 'But rather than a sign that
audiences are falling, they show that theatre producers are getting more
aggressive in their marketing.'
Swet is planning a campaign aimed at London rail commuters which will
include discount inducements. While these types of promotions are not new,
the scope is.
The half-price ticket booth in Leicester Square - where discounted tickets
for are sold on the day of the performance - has recently moved from a
pre-fab hut opened 11 years ago to a permanent building. The Leicester
Square operation has attracted competition from agencies and individual
theatres.
Many theatres offer standby tickets, often to groups such as students and
pensioners, which are sold at half price on the day of performance. Some are
offering special-price days, while others have elected to break a golden
rule and open on Sundays.
In some London restaurants, customers find vouchers offering two tickets for
the price of one. Ms Gillian Guy, the promoter responsible, says: 'Old
theatregoers will always be theatregoers. What we are trying to do is tap
those who think it is too expensive.'
Swet says attendances were 12 per cent higher in the first quarter of 1992
than in the same period last year, when theatres were badly hit by the
effects of the Gulf war. Mr Mark Watty, Swet's marketing manager, says:
'Last year showed we can't rely on the US or long-haul market any more.
That's why we have to concentrate on developing and cultivating the home
market.'

FT  23 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Equities wind down ahead of
holiday
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
Wall Street
AIDED BY technical trading in stock futures, US equities posted modest gains
yesterday as the markets wound down ahead of the long holiday weekend,
writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
At the close the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up just 8.06 at 3,386.77.
The more broadly based Standard &amp; Poor's 500 rose 1.42 to 414.02, while the
Amex composite finished 0.82 higher at 392.46 and the Nasdaq composite 1.20
higher at 580.30. Turnover on the NYSE was very light at 147m shares.
With the Treasury market shutting at 1 pm so that traders could leave for
home early, trading in equities was listless for most of the day. Stocks
were initially led higher by the futures markets, and held on to those gains
in the wake of gains in bond prices.
The overall mood, however, remained subdued amid disappointment that the
Federal Reserve chose not to cut interest rates this week. Share prices have
been bid up recently in anticipation of an easing in policy and, now that it
has not materialised, the chances of the market advancing much above 3,400
on the Dow have deteriorated, said analysts.
Among individual stocks, General Motors firmed Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 39
1/4 in turnover of 2m shares after Mr Robert Stempel, the chairman, said
that GM was accelerating a restructuring of its unprofitable North American
operations. Mr Stempel said that he expected productivity to improve by 7
per cent to 8 per cent per year as the restructuring takes effect.
McDonalds fell Dollars  5/8 to Dollars 45 7/8 in spite of encouraging
comments at the annual meeting by the food chain's chairman saying the
company was experiencing positive sales momentum in most of the world.
Raytheon rose in early trading on the news that the aviation electronics and
weapons group will be making staff cuts in the wake of the reductions in US
defence budgets, but gave up all of its gains by the close to end down
Dollars  1/8 at Dollars 44 3/8 .
Rohr Industries slumped Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 12 in active trading after
reporting a fiscal third quarter loss of Dollars 1.42 a share, compared to
the profit of 15 cents a share earned at the same stage a year ago.
Oklahoma Gas &amp; Electric fell another Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 36 1/2 as
investors reacted negatively to a company statement that its earnings were
not sufficient to maintain the annual dividend.
Gottschalks fell Dollars  1/4 to Dollars 11 after the broking house Smith
Barney downgraded the California-based retail department store chain stock
from 'buy' to 'avoid' because of uncertainty generated by a criminal
investigation into the company by the Internal Revenue Service.
In the same sector, Federated Department Stores firmed Dollars  5/8 to
Dollars 12 1/2 after Salomon Brothers initiated coverage of the stock with
an 'outperform' rating.
Canada
TORONTO ended slightly higher in moderate trading. According to preliminary
data, the composite index rose 14.10 points, or 0.42 per cent, to close at
3,372.15, for a loss on the week of about 19 points. Advances led declines
by 310 to 263. Volume was 27,797,000 shares valued at CDollars 233m.

FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: Smooth power change at the top
for Renault - The group's new chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is a sign of how times have changed at Renault that the French
state-owned car maker is expected in the next few days to put into effect
the smoothest power change in its history.
Mr Raymond Levy, chairman for the past six years, retired at midnight with
the automatic expiry of his second three-year mandate.
On Tuesday, the Renault board will nominate Mr Louis Schweitzer, 49, current
managing director, who Mr Levy has been grooming as his successor for the
past three years in the knowledge that he must retire by 65, which he
reaches next month.
The French cabinet has the final choice on public sector chairmanships and
is expected to give approval on Wednesday. It cannot easily choose anybody
else. Mr Schweitzer, one of the chief architects of Renault's alliance with
Volvo, has the support of Mr Pehr Gyllenhammar, the Swedish group's
president, who speaks for 20 per cent of the shares, the first time an
outside investor has had an influence on a change of leadership at Renault.
The principle of handing over power to someone inside the company has been
rare in French state-owned industry, where appointments are set by central
fiat, sometimes sensitive to political as much as business factors.
However, Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the new prime minister, has set the tone by
declaring that he does not want to impose unnecessary management changes at
the 45 or so other state companies whose chairmen come up for re-selection
in the next few months.
Trained in the oil and steel businesses, Mr Levy was parachuted into Renault
from the top job at Cockerill-Sambre, the Belgian steel group, after the
previous car group chairman, Mr Georges Besse, was killed by terrorists in
1986.
Mr Levy had little background in the car industry and so sensibly made it
his mission to pursue the strategies initiated by Mr Besse of injecting more
professionalism into management, cutting costs, modernising the organisation
of work, improving quality and quickly renewing the model line.
In 1987, Renault made its first profits for six years and earnings more than
doubled last year to FFr3.08bn (Dollars 567m) net, helped by a sharp rise in
sales to Germany, where Renault is the biggest selling foreign marque. The
alliance with Volvo, pushed hard by Mr Levy, has proved more successful than
either side expected and they both hint that it could develop into a full
merger. Mr Levy says his only regret is that he could not have moved faster.
Renault's old and new chairmen are very different people. Mr Levy is
outgoing, with a reputation for either charming or upsetting his colleagues.
On arriving at Renault, he made no bones about complaining that his
Belgian-bought Renault 25 needed repairing every month and refused to accept
sloppily written memos.
As an economic liberal, he gets on badly with Mr Jacques Calvet, the
chairman of Peugeot. Relations between the companies have sunk to an
unprecedented low in recent years.
Mr Schweitzer, a distinguished member of the left-wing establishment, is an
unflappable intellectual. He comes from a family of intellectuals, as son of
a former head of the International Monetary Fund and a great-nephew of Dr
Albert Schweitzer, the Nobel prize winning missionary.
He has a reputation for avoiding surface confrontation at all costs, but is
at the same time stubborn - a mix of qualities that might appeal to his
Swedish partners, and which might also permit better relations with Peugeot.
Just how he managed to get on so well with Mr Levy is a mystery, especially
since Mr Schweitzer once had the unenviable task of telling Mr Levy that his
services were no longer needed as the head of Usinor, the state-owned steel
group. At the time, Mr Schweitzer was senior adviser to Mr Laurent Fabius,
when the current Socialist party leader was prime minister.
Mr Schweitzer was appointed to the general management of Renault, his first
industrial job, just after the Socialists lost the 1986 election and just
before the death of Mr Besse. Mr Levy forgot old grudges fast after his
unexpected arrival at Renault and soon appointed Mr Schweitzer to deputy
managing director and then managing director in 1990.
The two men do have one thing in common in that they are both products of
the prestigious civil service colleges which prepare the French elite for
power.
Mr Schweitzer went to the Ecole Nationale d'Administration, founded after
the war to regenerate the civil service, and including among its alumni
several public sector chairmen and three prime ministers. He graduated to
become an Inspecteur des Finances, the qualification to join the fast track
at the treasury, awarded only to the top couple of dozen people of each
generation. As Mr Schweitzer's career shows, Inspecteurs des Finances are
also astonishingly adaptable.

FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: Canadian banks face claim over
O&amp;Y loan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON and ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AN international banking syndicate led by Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking
Corporation and Credit Lyonnais has accused four Canadian banks of garnering
an extraordinarily large chunk of Olympia &amp; York's assets as collateral for
a relatively small CDollars 126m (USDollars 105m) loan.
A Credit Lyonnais official alleged in an affidavit lodged with the Ontario
Court of Justice that the Canadian banks may have obtained a 'fraudulent
preference' as creditors of the property developer.
The international banks, which provided a USDollars 2.5bn 'jumbo' loan to
O&amp;Y in 1989, obtained a court ruling on Thursday evening which permits them
to challenge the collateral should O&amp;Y eventually be placed in bankruptcy
and its assets liquidated.
The four Canadian banks cited in the affidavit - Royal Bank of Canada,
Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Bank of Nova Scotia and National Bank of
Canada - advanced the CDollars 126m loan at the height of O&amp;Y's liquidity
crisis in March to help fund the Canary Wharf project. The banks had
originally agreed to provide CDollars 240m, but one of them raised
objections as rumours circulated about O&amp;Y's financial condition. Security
for the full loan had already been registered.
According to the affidavit, security for the loan includes two debentures,
each for USDollars 275m, against O&amp;Y's two biggest towers in Toronto, plus
pledges of shares in two other Toronto buildings.
Meanwhile, in New York, Mayor David Dinkins yesterday announced a plan that
will allow O&amp;Y to pay over 12 months a Dollars 126m property tax bill, half
of which would have become due on June 30. Failure to make the could have
forced O&amp;Y into a formal US bankruptcy filing on its New York properties.
The city has agreed to accept 12 monthly payments of Dollars 10.5m each,
plus two payments of Dollars 2.4m in interest penalties.
Moody's, the US credit rating agency, last night downgraded to Caa from B1
some Dollars 548m worth of securities issued by O&amp;Y's Water Street Finance
Company.
On Tuesday O&amp;Y told a meeting of Water Street noteholders that cash flow
from the Manhattan building would be insufficient to service the property's
debt next year.

FT  23 MAY 92 / A harvest of sorrows: The impact of Europe's farm reforms
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID RICHARDSON, FT Agricultural Columnist
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For some of the UK's larger farmers, Thursday's agreement on the reform of
the Common Agricultural Policy will seem like a stay of execution. With
luck, and assuming the details of the agreement, when they are released next
week, live up to the claims of EC agriculture ministers, the most efficient
and least heavily borrowed will survive for a few more years. But the
Brussels deal is not a reprieve; rather, farmers are still under sentence on
Death Row.
The first MacSharry plan 18 months ago prepared them for extinction. It
threatened to force them to take large chunks of land out of production
without offering compensation for the resulting losses. Only smallholders in
the UK and peasant farmers in other parts of the Community would have been
anything like as well off as they are now - and that is not well off at all.
It looked like a misguided exercise designed to destroy the potential to
produce cheap, wholesome food; to preserve the drudgery of running small
farms which non-participants perceive as the rustic charm of the countryside
; and to discriminate against the UK because of its superior farm structure
and larger average size. It also seemed ready to institutionalise
inefficiency.
The British farming industry has already suffered severe cuts in income over
the past few years and is not in good shape to tolerate further pressure. As
Mr John Nix, the agricultural economist, says in the introduction to the
last edition of his farm management pocketbook - the bible by which many
farmers plan their businesses - 'farm incomes per hectare (in the UK) are
now well below half the mid 1960s figure in real terms, while national
average earnings (of the rest of the population) have risen by about a
third'.
Against that background, the fact that even big acreage farmers will, under
this week's package, be compensated for land taken out of the production of
commodities in surplus, or set-aside, seems like a breakthrough. Similarly,
the agreement to raise the upper limit on sheep flock and beef herd sizes to
more realistic levels and still allow at least half the rate of headage
compensation paid to smaller farmers is a worthwhile concession although
probably not sufficient to save significant numbers of hill farmers.
Mr Nix says the future for many farmers looks bleak: 'They can only farm as
well as they can, spend less (if that is possible) both on and off the farm,
and wait for the eventual upturn - whenever that might be.' And that
judgment was based on commodity prices before the cuts that have just been
announced.
In other words, the reform package will make farmers' situation worse. The
NFU, for instance, estimates that arable farmers will have their net incomes
cut, after area compensation, by Pounds 30 per hectare (Pounds 12 per acre)
next year. With profit margins as slim as they are, that is serious.
The obvious way to save that much money is to cut manpower. Indeed several
of my farming neighbours have already said they intend to do just that. With
15 per cent of the land out of production, and only needing to be mown a few
times a year, there will be less work to be done. A tractor driver's pay,
national insurance and other costs to his employer come to about Pounds
12,000, so the decision is easily made. Or is it?
On my own Norfolk farm, the labour force has been reduced for many years in
response to income pressure. I now have only three men working on the arable
side of the farm, and many of the jobs they do require a gang of at least
that size in order to achieve maximum efficiency. Bring the number down to
two, and the balance and speed of work such as sowing and harvesting would
be disrupted. This would lead to less efficient work and make it more
vulnerable to wet weather.
The probability that other EC legislation seems set to limit the number of
hours farm and other workers will be allowed to work will restrict
flexibility further and can only make matters worse. More workers will have
to leave the land because their employers cannot afford to keep them.
The reform package, with its set-aside provisions, makes it inevitable that
rural unemployment will increase. For there will also be fewer jobs in
agriculture's ancillary trades. With 15 per cent of Britain's farm land set
aside, there will be less grain, oil seed, sugar beet and other crops to
haul from farm to processing plant. With less land being cultivated, fewer
tractors and farm implements will be needed and the farm machinery trade
will decline even further from its already depressed level. A Norfolk
machinery dealer told me that Macsharry was the last straw. He has already
decided to give up the struggle to make a profit and he will sell up as soon
as possible. Sales of inputs such as seeds, fertilisers and crop protection
chemicals will also decline.
Moreover, fertiliser and chemical sales may fall further than the obvious 15
per cent based on the set-aside acreage. Farmers will be looking at the new
pricing structures, and calculating whether the optimum levels of such
products may have changed.
Last year, for instance, it quickly became clear that area payment for oil
seeds combined with a lower sale price meant that the optimum yield for the
best return had declined from the biggest tonnage it was possible to grow
(probably in excess of 1.5 tonnes per acre) to around 1 tonne per acre.
From that viewpoint, the new measures may achieve reduced production, as
ministers require, and bring about perceived improvements in the
environment. What it will not do is cut the cost of the CAP to EC taxpayers.
Indeed, it is accepted that for the first few years, expenditure will
increase.
On the positive side, the lower cereal prices the reform package will bring
about should reduce the cost of livestock feed.
And consumers? Will they benefit by being able to buy cheaper food? I
suggest that this is a pipe dream. The proportion of the retail price the
farmer gets is tiny and any advantage brought about by lower raw material
prices may be absorbed by the food trade.
Meanwhile, I must face the unpalatable prospect of more than 150 acres of my
farm growing weeds instead of crops. One Lincolnshire farmer on top-quality
land said that he would have to be dragged into set-aside. He would far
rather sell his grain for whatever he can get and forego any area
compensation. It is not clear whether such a course of action will be legal.
Set aside will also be unpopular among farmers because much of the pleasure
of farming lies in trying to grow better crops every year. Passing motorists
are unlikely to welcome the policy either, especially when they realise that
a portion of their taxes is paying me to grow nothing on that land.
That alone will lead to intense pressure to cut the payments. And then there
remains the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, which is still
unresolved. Will an agreement in Geneva cut farm incomes still further? Will
farmers find it even more difficult to survive in business?
The hope for farmers is that the governments of the world will take so many
measures, on the lines of CAP reform, in order to cut food production that
they will overdo it and cause shortages. When you look closely at the
rundown in world stocks of some basic commodities over recent years and
discount some of the very localised rhetoric on European surpluses, that
possibility does not seem out of the question. If that happened farmers
would be only too pleased to sell produce at world market prices.

ungainly example of multi-media, a 1960 pocket radio with an old-style Seiko
watch wedged in at the top.
In spite of the mixed success on display at Sony, the spectacular growth of
Japanese electronics companies over the past decade has given them a sense
of certainty that the 2004 US presidential election campaign will be
followed by a Chinese farmer using Japanese television technology, and that
the world will listen to the next wave of popular music on portable,
compatible, indefatigable Japanese equipment.
It is this sense of certainty, and the profits from having mastered mass
manufacturing techniques, that has fuelled the product development
departments of Japan's large consumer electronics groups and spurred their
drive into next-generation television technology a decade before their
competitors had committed themselves to high definition television (HDTV).
But now this sense of confidence is under assault. For the past few years,
the consumer electronics industry as a whole has suffered from a dearth of
new product ideas, and the Japanese companies have in general simply been
adding knobs and apertures to existing equipment. Sales of televisions and
video-cassette recorders in Japan have been falling since the final quarter
of 1988, well before the economy began slowing.
Financially, the companies are facing higher capital costs at home, and the
two market leaders, Sony and Matsushita Electric Industrial, reported steep
falls in profit this week. Sony reported a 44 per cent drop in pre-tax
profits to Y166bn; Matsushita, its main rival, saw profits fall 39 per cent
to Y363bn. More important than the financial difficulties, the companies'
confidence in their ability to judge consumer trends has also been seriously
shaken.
The future of HDTV remains unclear. Japanese television makers had started
to market the machines even though programmes could only be received for a
few hours a day. They have also been adversely affected by the decision of
the European and US electronics industries to adopt different standards. For
Sony, this has not been the only recent setback. The company, renowned for
its nifty product ideas and marketing skills, has suffered the defeat of
Betamax, its VCR format, in the face of a competing format, the VHS system,
and more recently its Digital Audio Tape flopped for lack of music business
support throughout the world.
Such experiences have tarnished Sony's previously high reputation for
predicting and even for creating new consumer demands. The company is
looking dangerously vulnerable to a further marketing reversal. The group
has promised to deliver its next international 'hit' later this year - a
small, portable mini CD player which it hopes will be to the CD player what
the Walkman was to the cassette tape recorder. But the Mini Disc has so far
failed to capture the imagination of consumers, partly because it has been
preceded by Philips's competing system of digital cassette tape recorders
and partly because listeners who tossed out their old tapes for CDs are
unwilling to change again.
Like much of the Japanese industry, Sony is pinning its hopes on the
embryonic multi-media technology, which combines video, photography, data,
animation and sound. But, to the disappointment of Japanese executives, it
is in the US, specifically in the computer industry, that the most
attractive multi-media ideas are surfacing.
Multi-media offers the prospect of bringing the vast information-storing and
processing capabilities of computers to consumer entertainment products. The
computer's intelligence that drives that capability - the software - is
increasingly seen as the crucial spark that can rekindle consumer demand.
Films on video can be made more exciting by providing people with a vast
library to choose from, not at the video shop, but on screen. Or how about
interactive films that can be edited and rearranged to satisfy the viewer's
creative instinct? With technological developments and the right software
the television can become as intelligent as the computer.
And the electronic personal organisers now on the market may tempt otherwise
reluctant consumers to buy, if they could call up video snippets of the
latest Madonna concert or pictures of the family, or provide a fax and
mobile phone system that could link them to a data bank providing details of
just how many times Arsenal has beaten Liverpool at home.
A CD player doesn't have to be just for music. A CD itself can store vast
amounts of information - the last 10 issues of GQ, together with Moby Dick
and other novels in their entirety, films and video games. A multi-media
book could play all these different discs with all the information
accessible at the touch of a key.
Experimenting with multi-media has kept a growing number of American
computer manufacturers busy, while Japanese companies have poured money into
ultimately futile attempts to convince consumers that they want extra knobs
on their VCRs.
Apple, the computer group, has been working on what it calls a personal
digital assistant that will act like a personal computer, mobile phone and
fax combined. Microsoft, the computer software group headed by Bill Gates,
has sponsored several multi-media conferences over the years and is trying
to establish itself as the software supplier for multi-media products. Many
small West Coast companies are experimenting with multi-media technology and
churning out software that will drive the technology.
The realisation that software will be the driving force behind the next
generation of consumer products has led to moves by consumer electronics
manufacturers into the world of American entertainment. Matsushita has
bought MCA, the entertainment group, while Sony has bought Columbia
Pictures. Philips, the Dutch group, has set up a multi-media software
company in the US and has bought Whittle, a producer of educational
programmes.
These movie studio and recording label purchases have created extra
uncertainty for the two main Japanese electronics companies, which are
beginning to realise just how unpredictable the entertainment industry can
be. The end-year results this week released by Sony, a company accustomed to
steady if rapid growth, showed a 65.2 per cent fourth-quarter increase in
revenue from films and a 15.8 per cent fall in music sales.
But while Japanese manufacturers may not be able to define the immediate
benefits of their entertainment purchases, they are increasingly confident
that the software that runs computers offers just the extra bit of added
value to consumer products needed to stimulate a sluggish market.
And for that software as well, they need to go to the US. The trend is
evident in the tie-up of Sony, Apple Computer and Motorola to develop
multi-media products expected to find their way into the living-room later
this decade. In part, these partnerships are about matching different
technological skills, for example, Sony's expertise in audio visual
products, Apple's software and computing skills, and Motorola's
communications expertise, but they are also an attempt to pool resources in
the search for a space in people's lifestyles that can be filled with
electronic goods.
The belief that every pocket should have a personal digital assistant has
prompted alliances between AT&amp;T and Matsushita, NCR and Poqet, a subsidiary
of Fujitsu, and Apple Computer and Sharp, which is now the leading producer
of electronic personal organisers that can store and retrieve information.
There are useful business applications for these products - for example, for
pizza delivery companies and salesmen - but the manufacturers are
particularly keen to succeed in the consumer market. They have yet to
convince the average family that it really needs the present generation of
pocket organisers.
Sales of some products have, however, been somewhat disappointing in Japan,
where Sony was confident that its pen-based palmtop system would be a hit
after its release in 1990. The market is still flat even though the pen
better suits the Japanese language, for which a keyboard is awkward.
The partnerships also raise the possibility that makers in different
countries will be able to agree on common specifications for their systems.
It would be frustrating if you were able to use a personal organiser to call
up the UK soccer results or the latest movements in the Nikkei stock market
index while on a business trip to Bahrain, but you found that the local
retrieval network was incompatible with your equipment.
It is still too early to predict whether the US or Japan will take the lead
in the partnerships, and in which areas the industry will develop. The
tie-ups may herald a comeback for the US in the world of consumer
electronics as Japanese groups becoming increasingly aware that they need to
co-operate with international rivals especially in the software arena.
Making the leap from the world of computers to the world of consumer
entertainment will not be an easy one for American electronics groups
either. They recognise the value of the manufacturing and mass-marketing
skills of the Japanese consumer product manufacturers and the difficulty of
entering a market in which they have little experience. Apple probably needs
Sony just as much as Sony needs Apple.
The real question for the international electronics industry may be not
whether the Americans or Japanese or Europeans dominate the next-generation
markets, but whether consumers want the electronics-based lifestyle that the
industry would like them to have.
One reason that urban Japanese tend not to carry electronic gadgets around
with them is that there is a strong sense that life is high-tech enough at
the moment. And it is not only Japanese consumers who decided that they
preferred a watch on their wrist and not in their radio.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Death report exaggerated
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
REPORTS OF the death of the German economic consensus turn out to have been
exaggerated. Pronouncements that the anchor role of the D-Mark can be shared
with, or even assumed by, other European currencies are probably equally
premature.
The wage deal agreed this week in the German engineering industry - 5.8 per
cent this year, followed by 3.4 per cent in 1993, along with an hour's cut
in the working week - shows first, that the German consensual approach to
economic policy-making is still working; second, that tough monetary policy
is bringing inflationary pressures back under control; but, finally, that
the road back to traditional German monetary performance will be long and
hard.
The consensus may have worked, but at a high price. Monetary growth ran at
an annualised rate of 8.8 per cent between the fourth quarter of 1991 and
April 1992 (well above the Bundesbank's target range of 3 1/2 to 5 1/2 per
cent). Many question the government's ability to restore control over public
finances and the German economy remains robust. All this suggests a much
looser monetary policy remains a distant dream.
The difficulties into which unification has dragged Germany have led others
to claim that they can share in the role of providing the monetary anchor
for Europe. Mr Jacques de Larosiere, governor of the Bank of France, said
only this week that the French franc is just as important as the D-Mark
within the European Monetary System.
He is being somewhat hasty. The anchor role has been won by the Bundesbank
through competition in the market place. The only way to convince the
markets that one's currency is as good as the D-Mark is to show that one's
central bank is at least as good as the Bundesbank.
Price stability
Even the Bank of France has some distance to go. Inflation of around 3 per
cent looks excellent. But since it has been achieved during a period of
below trend economic growth and rising unemployment, it falls well short of
long-term price stability. Even with 3 per cent inflation, a currency loses
95 per cent of its value over a century. This is not price stability on any
reasonable definition.
The difficulties into which unification has dragged Germany have imposed a
monetary policy that, however painful, is appropriate, not merely for
countries like Italy, Spain and the UK, but for France as well. True, it is
appropriate only if price stability is the overriding goal. That can be
disputed. But it cannot be disputed by those who hope to displace a central
bank which is certain that the price is not too high. Nor can it be disputed
by those who intend to ratify the Maastricht treaty. For that treaty commits
the EC to establishing an independent central bank 'whose primary aim shall
be to maintain price stability'.
Slow growth
It would be possible to postpone that achievement, perhaps until the new
central bank has been established. But it is precisely during a period of
slow growth that the EC has the best chance of attaining its goal. More
important, it is only by the performance of others that the Germans will be
persuaded to take the risk of economic and monetary union.
Doubts about the desirability of price stability are, in any case, somewhat
beside the point. German unification is forcing it on Europe, willy nilly.
The chancellor of the exchequer, for example, suggested this week that 2 per
cent inflation should be the target for the UK. The UK is far from any such
figure at the moment. The high interest rates imposed by Germany give the UK
its best chance of achieving it.
The price is unquestionably high. The UK's gross domestic product fell by
another 0.6 per cent between the last quarter of 1991 and the first of 1992.
Over seven successive quarters of decline, GDP has fallen by 4.2 per cent.
Yet underlying inflation in the economy as a whole is still around 5 1/2 per
cent.
Opinion can reasonably differ, over whether this price is worth paying. But
only those who convince the markets they believe it is can hope to enjoy
interest rates below German levels for a sustained period. Equally, only
those who share this faith have any business ratifying the treaty agreed at
Maastricht.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Output falls 0.6% in first quarter: Recession continues into
seventh quarter - Order books at best level since 1990
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A FURTHER fall in UK output during the first three months of this year has
dragged the longest post-war recession into its seventh successive quarter.
Overall gross domestic product fell 0.6 per cent in the first quarter and
1.5 per cent compared with the corresponding period last year.
The fall in output for the whole economy, excluding oil and gas extraction,
was 0.4 per cent compared with the previous quarter. This brought the annual
rate of decline to minus 1.6 per cent.
The figures from the Central Statistical Office show that this recession has
been longer but not as steep as the recession of 1979-81.
Non-oil GDP has fallen 4.3 per cent over seven quarters from a peak in the
second quarter of 1990. This is only two thirds as deep as the 1979-81
recession, when non-oil output dropped 6.2 per cent.
Overall GDP has fallen 4.2 per cent against the 5.5 per cent decline of
1979-81.
The decline in manufacturing output has been only half as severe this time
round. Since the second quarter of 1990 manufacturing output has fallen 7.7
per cent. This compares with a 16.4 per cent fall in output from the second
quarter of 1979 to the first quarter of 1981.
So far, output of the services industry has fallen by 2.4 per cent, the same
drop as in 1979-81. In the first quarter of this year the services
industries' output was 0.3 per cent lower than in the previous quarter.
Manufacturing output, however, grew by 0.3 per cent, the first quarterly
rise since the recession began.
Oil and gas extraction output fell 4.3 per cent on the previous quarter
because of maintenance works, while the mild winter was responsible for a
4.2 per cent drop in other energy and water supply.
Manufacturers, wholesalers and retailers in the UK reduced their stocks in
the first quarter of this year by Pounds 173m after a fall of Pounds 1.41bn
in the fourth quarter of last year, according to provisional figures from
the CSO.
Within this, retailers increased their stocks by Pounds 228m following a
decrease of Pounds 148m in the fourth quarter.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Economy 'on the turn' says CBI: Company liquidations fall
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN, Economics Correspondent and PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE UK economy is 'on the turn', the Confederation of British Industry said
yesterday. Although official figures showed the recession continuing into
the first quarter of this year, the CBI's industrial trends survey for May
and its latest economic forecast pointed to better times.
The CBI found that many manufacturers had experienced a marked improvement
in home and export orders in recent weeks, raising expectations of higher
output over the next four months.
However, the CBI's own economists expect only modest economic expansion of
0.9 per cent this year after last year's 2.4 per cent decline in output. The
CBI forecasters, who have revised down their expectations of 1992 growth
from 1.7 per cent last November, expect the economy to gather momentum over
the year and grow by 2.9 per cent next year.
The CBI found in this month's survey that total order books, although still
well below normal, were at their best levels since August 1990, when Iraq
invaded Kuwait. It found that export order books were at levels last seen in
October 1990.
Over the next four months, 31 per cent of companies expect to increase their
output volume and only 18 per cent predict a decline. The balance, which
indicates the trend, was plus 13 per cent this month. It was the highest
figure since July 1989 and compared with plus 5 per cent in April this year
and a negative balance of 18 per cent in May last year.
The CBI surveyed 1,277 companies in 50 industries between April 28 and May
13. The companies are responsible for about half of British manufacturing
employment and exports.
It found that stocks were run down in May, with a balance of only 13 per
cent of companies - the lowest balance since September 1990 - saying stocks
were more than adequate to meet expected demand.
Mr Sudhir Junakar and Professor Douglas McWilliams, CBI economists, believe
that an end to destocking should play a leading part in bringing about an
economic upturn this year. They expect that a Pounds 3bn turnround in the
stock cycle will contribute some 0.7 percentage points of the 1.6 per cent
increase in domestic demand now expected for this year.
Other factors stimulating growth, they say, will be rises in exports and in
consumer spending, and higher spending by the government. They add that
improved domestic and foreign demand will help manufacturers. The CBI
expects manufacturing output to start rising on a year-on-year basis around
the middle of this year and to expand at an annual 3.4 per cent rate in the
fourth quarter of this year and in 1993.
The number of jobs in manufacturing industry is expected to fall by nearly
220,000 between the end of March this year and the end of next year. The CBI
expects seasonally adjusted unemployment excluding school leavers to
increase to 2.9m next year from 2.8m this year with the unemployment rate
rising to 10.3 per cent from 9.7 per cent.
The CBI warns that the path of the recovery could be bumpy. Growth is likely
to be pick up in the current quarter following the general election. But it
could slow a little in the third quarter before rising to around the UK's
underlying trend rate of 2.5 per cent in the fourth quarter and in 1993.
CBI economists also warn that the strength of the recovery is 'by no means
assured'. The state of the housing market - with activity low and prices
falling - could weaken confidence.
The US recovery is uneven while the present low value of the dollar makes
exporting to the US and some other countries difficult for UK companies.
Inflationary pressures in Germany may force the Bundesbank to raise interest
rates and so restrict growth in Europe, thereby hurting UK exports.
However, the CBI expects UK bank base rates to fall to 9.5 per cent by the
end of this year and 8 per cent by the end of next year as German monetary
conditions ease.
It also predicts a recovery in UK non-oil company profits of 7.5 per cent in
real terms this year and 12.5 per cent next year. It says such an
improvement would reflect lower unit labour costs, improved profit margins,
better cost control and lower inflation.
The CBI nevertheless expects manufacturing industry to cut investment until
the fourth quarter of this year. Next year, however, it expects a rise of
4.5 per cent in manufacturing investment and an increase of 4.7 per cent in
total capital spending.

Trends Dept, Centre Point, New Oxford Street, London WC1A 1DU.
THE NUMBER of company liquidations fell slightly during the first quarter,
supporting hopes that the recession may have bottomed out, Paul Taylor
writes.
Compulsory and voluntary liquidations totalled 6,035 in the first three
months of the year compared with 6,017 in the previous quarter, according to
KPMG Peat Marwick, the accountancy firm. That compares with a 30.7 per cent
rise between the third and final quarters last year. Company liquidations in
the early months of this year were still 10.2 per cent higher than in the
first quarter of last year.
Mr Tim Hayward, head of corporate recovery at KPMG, said: 'There are signs
that the economy may be starting to come off the bottom, although we shall
need to wait and see whether the recovery can be sustained.'
The number of individual bankruptcies in the first quarter was 8,389, a 20.9
per cent rise on the previous quarter and a 73.5 per cent rise on the same
quarter last year. Mr Hayward said debtors petitioning for their own
bankruptcy may have caused the rise. Changes in procedure had made
petitioning less painful.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Government to sell off part of property agency
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR, Construction Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE government yesterday announced plans to sell off the Property Services
Agency's projects division, one of Britain's biggest construction
organisations.
The environment department said the division, which designs and constructs
buildings for government bodies, had attracted interest from 60 companies
including some international groups. The sale terms will be advertised next
week in the UK and on the Continent in the Financial Times.
Several large quoted British construction and engineering groups have
previously expressed an interest in buying all or part of the division,
which has 2,000 employees. They are thought to include Tarmac, Trafalgar
House, Taylor Woodrow and BICC.
The sale comes when the UK construction industry is at a low ebb and many
companies in the sector are strapped for cash. The agency builds offices,
courts, prisons, laboratories, civil and military airports and other
installations. Last year it had a turnover of Pounds 190m.
Most government construction contracts for the past two years have been
subject to competitive tender. The agency, with its experience of
public-sector building requirements and its strong links to government
departments, has remained in a strong position and has continued to win a
large share of the work.
Companies buying the business will be expected to give commercial guarantees
for work completed or being undertaken by the PSA. This could restrict what
bidders are willing to pay. The winner may also have to fund substantial
redundancy payments as it merges the division with its own contracting
businesses. As a result, the government is unlikely to raise much money from
the sale.
One large publicly quoted contractor said yesterday that it regarded the
risks as too great and it would not bid.
Mr John Redwood, environment minister, said: 'While I would prefer to sell
the projects division as a single entity, it is open to prospective
purchasers to indicate their interest in part purchases.
He called for preliminary bids by June 26 and final offers about four weeks
later. The environment department has appointed Coopers &amp; Lybrand Deloitte,
the accountancy firm, to advise on the sale.

FT  23 MAY 92 / ITV will ask court to bar soccer deal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND SNODDY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ITV ASSOCIATION said last night it planned to seek an injunction to
block completion by the Premier League of a football deal with British Sky
Broadcasting and the BBC worth Pounds 304m over five years.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of the association that represents all ITV companies,
said after consulting Mr Christopher Carr QC that the injunction would be
sought on Tuesday.
The aim will be to prevent Premier League clubs from completing a contract
without giving ITV the chance to respond to BSkyB's last-minute improved
offer to a meeting of league chairman last Monday.
ITV is seeking the injunction on the grounds of breach of confidence. It
alleges that details of its final offer were disclosed to BSkyB, enabling
the satellite consortium to make an improved offer.
Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has a stake in BSkyB in which Mr
Rupert Murdoch's News International has the biggest holding.
The final ITV offer was worth Pounds 262m including overseas rights and
sponsorship over five years. Mr Dyke declined to say at a press conference
whether individuals would be named in the application for an injunction.
Mr Alan Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur and of Amstrad, the consumer
electronics company, said yesterday he had called BSkyB with details of the
ITV deal. He added: 'They had already been informed of ITV's final offer.'
Mr Dyke said yesterday that Mr Rick Parry, chief executive of the Premier
League, had been named in newspaper reports as a person who had called
BSkyB. Mr Dyke called on Mr Parry to confirm or deny this. He also said he
had asked to meet Sir Gordon Borrie, director-general of fair trading, about
the deal.
He said that on May 15 Mr Parry had said that Mr Murdoch, chief executive of
News Corporation, had promised the full support of his five national
newspapers for the league. That promise had been repeated to the league
chairmen and may have influenced the way some voted, Mr Dyke alleged. 'We
would like the whole matter to be opened up to informed debate,' he added.
Mr Andrew Knight, News International chairman, said last night that normal
editorial judgment would prevail in coverage of the league.
Sir John Quinton, chairman of the Premier League and of Barclays Bank,
yesterday rejected ITV complaints of unfair treatment. The league had
'formally accepted' the offer from BSkyB and the BBC, and he hoped there
would no further debate.
Mr Marmaduke Hussey, BBC chairman, was asked at a press conference yesterday
whether he had discussed the football deal with Mr Murdoch. He said that was
not the sort of question he answered. When the question was put again the
press conference was brought to an end.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
NAMES on the troubled Outhwaite syndicate 317/661 at the Lloyd's insurance
market may need to pay new cash calls to meet higher-than-expected losses on
the 1982 year.
In February, nearly two thirds of the syndicate's 1,614 Names won a Pounds
116m out-of-court settlement compensating them for losses. The deal included
a Pounds 34m provision to compensate for claims still arising from US
liability reinsurance business. There are now fears that this amount could
be inadequate. It is understood that claims of about Pounds 24m were
notified last year, bringing the syndicate's losses for 1982 to about Pounds
224m.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Smith takes leadership campaign to regions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN SMITH will begin to take his Labour leadership bid around the
country next week as almost all observers now concede that, barring
unforeseen mishaps, he is assured of victory in July over Mr Bryan Gould.
Mr Robin Cook, his campaign manager, yesterday ducked the charge of
premature triumphalism as he released details of regional visits and
speaking engagements. Yet when questioned on the state of the campaign, Mr
Cook expressed easy confidence that his candidate would win comfortably in
all three sections of the electoral college.
He said that Mr Smith could expect at least 88 per cent of the trade-union
vote, which represents 40 per cent of the college. He could also expect up
to 180 of the 269 parliamentary votes - 30 per cent of the college - and
soundings in the constituencies suggested that support was 'very healthy'.
In Mr Gould's camp, there are clear indications that attention is firmly
focused on the much closer deputy leadership race, which Mr Gould is also
contesting.
Suggestions that Mr John Prescott, shadow transport secretary, is making
ground among the unions are provoking highly varied interpretations of
voters' intentions.
While supporters of the favourite in the deputy race, Mrs Margaret Beckett,
insist that all scenarios favour her chances, others claim resistance is
mounting among unions and constituencies to the so-called 'dream ticket' of
Smith and Beckett.
A Gould supporter said that if Mr Gould was knocked out in the first round,
Mr Prescott would defeat Mrs Beckett in the run-off. However, if Mr Gould
came first or second his appeal as an imaginative, southern England MP would
ensure victory over either of his rivals in the run-off.
Mr Prescott's team said Mr Gould's candidature for the leadership would
undermine his ability to gather sufficient votes for deputy as few would
wish to vote for him for both posts.
A debate over Labour's controversial Clause Four - which commits the party
to a policy of nationalisation - would be a distraction that would divert
the party from addressing the causes of its election defeat, Mr David
Blunkett, Mr Gould's campaign manager, said.

FT  23 MAY 92 / CAP reform benefits may not reach consumers
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NEIL BUCKLEY and BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EFFECTS of the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy are more likely
to be seen in the rural landscape of the UK than on its supermarket shelves.
The Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food said yesterday it estimated
that the reform would reduce food prices by 2 per cent over the next three
years, as long as savings were passed on. The 2 per cent figure refers to
the food retail prices index, which includes many foods such as fruit which
are not affected.
Some food and farming organisations expressed doubts over whether the full
effect of the cuts would be passed on to the consumer, however.
Mr Martin Palmer, head of economic services at the Meat and Livestock
Commission, said that the CAP cuts would not necessarily translate into
lower end-prices. 'If you take those measures alone, without any other
factors, yes, you should see a reduction in price. But there are lots of
other factors,' he said.
Mr Palmer said that farmers were already under pressure from consumers to
produce increasingly high-quality meat at lower prices, while at the same
time complying with concerns over animal welfare and the environment. The
effect of the CAP changes might be to satisfy consumers' demands in those
areas without raising prices in real terms.
Some analysts suggested that big retailers would use the opportunity to
increase their profit margins. Safeway, the supermarket chain, said it was
too early to estimate price changes because EC intervention stocks would not
be affected until the mid 1990s, but added: 'Whenever they do become
available, all CAP-related price reductions in the food we buy will be
passed on to customers.'
The National Farmers' Union said: 'Farmers have no control over the retail
price. It is very difficult, really impossible, to say how these cuts are
going to be worked through - a whole chain has to be taken into
consideration.'
The Milk Marketing Board said that a small price cut was possible but this
depended on various factors, and ultimately on what shops decide to charge.
Mr Stephen Thornhill, head of marketing and economics at the Home Grown
Cereals Authority, said that the basic cereal price would drop significantly
but the effect might not be noticeable to consumers. 'The retail margin on
pricing accounts for much more of the finished product price than the basic
commodity, particularly in cereals,' he said.
One food industry analyst said he thought that savings would be passed on
because of consumer pressure. 'There is no way the processing industry will
be allowed to keep them,' he said. 'I think it will go down the chain, right
to the consumer.'
A more vivid illustration of the effects of the CAP may be the appearance of
the countryside.
Britain's rural landscape could be transformed - particularly the vast
swathes of agricultural land in areas such as East Anglia, Lincolnshire and
Northumberland. Fifteen per cent of arable will stand idle as a result of
the agreement on set-aside - more than 1.5m acres, or an area bigger than
Devon.
Friends of the Earth, the environment pressure group, warned that the
set-aside agreement was a 'blunt tool', and should have been targeted to
protect the environment, with conditions on the way farms were managed
imposed on set-aside compensation payments to ensure they resulted in
environmental gains.
Set-aside land might be left fallow. This might provide wildlife
sanctuaries, but only temporarily as much of the land would be rotated so
there would be little long-term environmental benefit. Where the soil or
weather is poor, the use of the land may change if farming ceases to be
profitable altogether.
Another transformation of the landscape could be the growth of US-style
superfarms, as small farmers find it impossible to remain profitable and
sell out to bigger farmers who can achieve economies of scale.
This could have a double-edged effect on the economy. Mr Jim Ward, head of
the agricultural research department at Savills, the agricultural and
residential property consultant, said the CAP agreement removed the
uncertainty that had blighted the agricultural land market for the last
three years.
He predicted an upturn in activity, perhaps returning to 1988 levels by next
year. This could be followed by a slow increase in values. 'In the
longer-term I'm very bullish about land prices,' Mr Ward said.
But as farmers are forced to cut costs and boost productivity, there could
be other significant socio-economic consequences.
The Rural Development Commission had predicted a loss of up to 100,000 jobs
in agriculture over the decade if the CAP were reformed. Mr Geoff
Lutterloch, head of rural economy at the RDC, stood by the figures.
'Agriculture faces a painful period of readjustment,' he said. 'More than
14,000 agricultural jobs were lost in the year to June 1991 anyway, and we
are predicting that farming will continue to lose labour throughout the
decade.'
The RDC launched its the Countryside Employment Programme earlier this year
with pilot programmes in Lincolnshire, the Welsh Marches and the Cotswolds,
selected as areas typical of those likely to be affected by CAP reform.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Agrochemicals industry warns of 20% cut in sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW TAYLOR and PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
REFORM of the common agricultural policy could cut sales of agrochemical
products in Europe by as much as 20 per cent, the industry said yesterday.
Manufacturers of agricultural equipment, however, were relieved that the
uncertainty over the extent of the CAP reforms had been removed. Some
equipment suppliers said that farmers who had post-poned making investment
decisions while ministers were deliberating might now make long-awaited
purchases.
As a result tractors and other equipment could be boosted in the short term.
Imperial Chemical Industries, the UK's biggest manufacturer of
agrochemicals, warned that the reforms would lead to a significant upheaval
and shake-out in the industry. According to ICI the worst affected markets
would be France, Germany and the UK. It said western Europe accounted for
about 30 per cent of the industry's worldwide sales.
Rhone-Poulenc, France's biggest agrochemicals supplier, said that with less
land being cultivated the number of competitors in the industry could
decline from 14 to six over the next decade.
ICI said that the sales decline in western Europe was likely to be offset by
increases in other markets, in particular Latin America. The overall world
market for agrochemicals was expected to remain static in spite of the
decline in the west Europe market.
Sales of agricultural equipment, particularly tractors, have plummeted in
the past 18 months as farmers have held back from making new investment.
According to the Agricultural Equipment Association, the number of tractors
sold in Britain last year fell by almost 16 per cent to 15,280. This
compares with 28,000 in 1983.
UK tractor manufacturers export about 90 per cent of their production, of
which about a third goes to EC countries. In addition, about 60 per cent of
exports of other kinds of agricultural equipment also goes to the EC.
Manufacturers were concerned about the effect CAP reform would have on other
EC countries which, according to the association, were likely to be more
vulnerable than the UK.
Mr John Young, chief executive of the agricultural equipment division of
Wolseley, the UK engineering group, said: 'It is too early to say what the
ultimate effect of the reforms will be. But there could be a slight recovery
in sales initially.'
Manufacturers were concerned that farmers faced with lower product prices
and with less land being cultivated would need to reduce their cost base.
This, however, might be achieved through increased mechanisation, said Mr
Young.

<TEXT>
GENERAL Suchinda Kraprayoon, whose resignation as Thai prime minister was
demanded in demonstrations which left 46 dead this week, was last night
reported to be quitting.
A senior army officer said he had been to King Bhumibol Adulyadej and may
have submitted his resignation. In any case Gen Suchinda would resign before
parliament met on Monday to discuss a constitutional amendment that would
force him out of office.
The parliamentary move follows agreement among the five parties in the
coalition government to back the reforms.
Their decision represents a significant victory for pro-democracy activists
inside and outside parliament - so much so that rumours yesterday swept
Bangkok of an imminent coup d'etat by military hardliners.
The decision followed weeks of hesitation over the amendments, culminating
in the deaths of at least 46 Thais in confrontations this week between
troops and pro-democracy demonstrators.
Proposed amendments would reduce the power of the military-appointed senate
and limit the premiership to elected members of parliament. Gen Suchinda,
the former armed forces chief, was not elected but appointed by the five
pro-military parties after they won a general election in March.
Yesterday Mr Pongpol Adireksan, the foreign minister, met foreign
ambassadors and later said with tears in his eyes that Gen Suchinda should
take the blame for the deaths of demonstrators. 'The image of the country
can only improve after we change the prime minister,' he said.
The softened stance of the ruling political parties is in marked contrast to
the unrepentant attitude of senior military figures such as Air Chief
Marshal Kaset Rojananil, the supreme commander; the military men now look
increasingly isolated in the face of demands that those responsible for the
shootings should resign or be punished.
The Confederation for Democracy, a 10-day-old umbrella organisation of
activists, yesterday insisted that the prime minister, the supreme commander
and the army commander resign; that those who ordered the killing be
punished according to the law; that the constitutional amendments be passed
within a month; that the government prevent future violence against
demonstrators; and that it compensate innocent victims.
Leaders of the group threatened strikes and demonstrations if the amendments
were not passed or Gen Suchinda refused to step down.
'If he does not resign then the people will show their strength again all
over the whole country,' Dr Sant Hathirat said. 'We are fighting for full
democracy and we will continue to fight whether it takes one day or one
month or one year.'
Mr Somsak Kosaisook, one of the leaders of a state enterprise labour
organisation dissolved following a coup by Gen Suchinda last year, said he
had met other union officials to discuss a strike. 'If the government
stumbles and does not follow up its promises, it is possible that both
public sector and private sector workers will go on strike,' he said.
According to The Nation newspaper, a group of oilfield employees of Thai
Shell Exploration and Production attempted to strike in protest against Gen
Suchinda this week. The company said yesterday that crude oil production had
been briefly disrupted because of an unspecified 'operational cause'.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR DAVID CLARK, Labour agriculture spokesman, yesterday dismissed the
'euphoria' shown by Mr John Gummer, agriculture minister, over the CAP deal.
'All the evidence we get is that the consumer will not benefit,' Mr Clark
said in the Commons.
He also said that the deal would not benefit small farmers. There were
protests from Tory MPs when Mr Clark referred to a 'suspicion' that Mr
Gummer had sold out small upland farmers to the 'barley barons in East
Anglia'.
In a statement to MPs, Mr Gummer was adamant that his negotiating stance had
safeguarded the position of the British farmer and ensured that those in the
hills and upland areas would be 'more directly supported'.
Mr Gummer was praised by government supporters for the substantial British
contribution to the reform package agreed in Brussels on Thursday. They
enthusiastically endorsed his claim that it represented 'a major step
forward for Europe, for Britain, for British consumers and taxpayers and for
British farmers'.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Pisa's lean times may be over: After 800 years, tower's tilt
must be stopped
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE WORLD'S toughest corset is being fitted on a very special customer, the
Leaning Tower of Pisa.
This week, workmen began to place 18 thin steel bands round the base of the
white marble tower as an emergency measure, to contain the stress on the
14,530 tonne structure. In its 800-year history as a leaning tower, this is
the first time such direct assistance has been necessary.
The emergency measures do not stop here. The group of 14 international
experts overseeing the fate of the tower this week agreed to a scheme to
stabilise the monument's famous incline. 'We are going ahead with the
placement of 600 tons of lead slabs at the base of the tower,' says Prof
Michele Jamiolkowski of Turin Polytechnic, head of the experts' commission.
The lead will be placed on the north side, opposite the tilt, will cover
about a quarter of the tower's circumference and will be about three metres
high.
'This is an experiment in controlled subsidence,' says Prof Carlo Viggiani
of the University of Naples. 'Imagine the tower is resting atop a mattress:
if you press down on one side of the mattress, the tower will move.'
By putting pressure in this way and eventually using perhaps 1,000 tons of
lead, the experts believe the 58.3 metre-high tower can be not only
stabilised, but pushed back to lessen its tilt.
The tower has been closed since January 1990, when the rate of tilt was
inexplicably found to have increased from 1.2mm to over 1.3mm a year.
Although infinitesimal, the 750 tonne belfry at the top has moved nearly a
quarter of a metre from the vertical in the last 100 years. The accumulated
deviation is now close to 5.5 metres and there were fears the building would
either topple over or break up under the stress of the increased tilt.
After all the past false alarms and eccentric proposals, one of which
suggested propping up the tower with a Coca-Cola bottle, the government was
sufficiently concerned to appoint an international body of experts and set
aside funding for a rescue operation.
'We may have been slow to go ahead with these emergency measures, but our
commission has no proper secretariat and we have had to cope with Italian
bureaucracy,' says Prof John Burland of London's Imperial College.
Prof Burland says it is the first time co-ordinated multi-disciplinary
scientific research has been carried out on the tower. His computer
simulations on the movement of soil have been instrumental in the decision
to employ lead weights. 'These emergency measures now give us time to think
of longer-term solutions,' he says.
The experts, the 17th commission since 1298, are working on the premise that
the tower must continue to be seen as leaning and free-standing. Indeed,
this is one of the rare instances in conservation where a monument's defects
are being consciously preserved.
Thus, the experts have ruled out dismantling the tower and rebuilding it or
following the suggestion of a Chinese engineer who claimed great success in
righting pagodas. They want to strengthen the tower and reduce the tilt
slightly.
The main difficulties concern the ground on which the tower stands, in the
magnificent Campo dei Miracoli alongside the cathedral. The water table,
traditionally close to the surface, has fallen in recent years, and this is
believed to have affected the tower's incline.
The experts are now talking either of preventing further access to the water
table around the tower by city users or of creating an underground barrier
which would maintain a constant water level around the tower.
A final solution is likely to take at least three years, and Mr Sergio
Cortopassi, Pisa's Socialist mayor, is anxious to keep pressure on the
politicians in Rome who control the purse-strings and the bureaucratic
short-cuts.
'Pisa without the Leaning Tower would not be Pisa,' he says.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Opec to roll over accord on oil output
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARK NICHOLSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec) yesterday agreed to
'roll over' its second-quarter oil output ceiling of 22.98m barrels a day
for the third quarter, but allowing an increase of at least 300,000 b/d in
Kuwaiti production.
Only 10 of the 13 members fully endorsed the roll-over, with Iran and Saudi
Arabia maintaining reservations they expressed to the previous ceiling in
February.
Iraq rejected the agreement, saying it should refer to the need to prepare
for Baghdad's re-entry into the oil market.
However, Mr Osama al-Hitti, Iraq's oil minister, gave no indication that
Baghdad was any nearer breaking a deadlock in talks with the United Nations
over the sale of a limited amount of crude in exception to the UN embargo.
Iran's reservations derive from its view that the February ceiling is too
high to attain Opec's reference price - its notional target price - of
Dollars 21 a barrel, while the Saudis insist they will produce no less than
8m b/d, rather than 7.88m b/d allocated for the second quarter and officials
said the kingdom would 'keep its options open' about a possible rise in
production during the third quarter.
Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister, nevertheless said he was happy
with yesterday's accord.
Accelerating Kuwaiti output, now over 900,000 b/d, and Saudi production at
8.06m b/d has helped push actual Opec output to nearer 23.5m b/d, despite
the February agreement. Oil analysts estimate that yesterday's deal could
see Opec pumping near 24m b/d by the end of the third quarter - a figure
corresponding to lower estimates of demand for Opec oil over the period.
Kuwait is expected to pump an average 1.2m b/d in the third quarter, but Dr
Subroto, Opec secretary general, said its output could rise to 1.5m b/d by
the quarter's end.

FT  23 MAY 92 / German printers win 5.8% rise

WEST German publishers yesterday approved an arbitrator's 5.8 per cent pay
award for 225,000 print workers. The increase went beyond what was
economically justified, the employers said.
They agreed only because they wanted to avoid increasing the damage already
caused by a week of warning strikes which had disrupted production of many
newspapers.
Together with a simultaneous deal on the same terms for 2.7m retailing
staff, the settlement in effect wound up this year's wages round, and spelt
an end to industrial unrest - at least for 1992.
Meanwhile, IG Chemie, the chemical industry union, agreed to ask in its
impending negotiations for an increase above the current inflation rate of
4.6 per cent.
The printing and retailing agreements further demonstrated the influence of
the metal working industry over the whole of Germany's private sector. Three
big industries have now settled since the IG Metall union accepted 5.8 per
cent on behalf of almost 4m engineers this week.
The IG Chemie claim suggests a more open-minded approach to negotiations
than was apparent in the earlier rounds. Most other unions went into talks
demanding increases of around 10 per cent. Settlements have been around 6
per cent.
The only big strike, which paralysed many public services for 11 days
earlier this month, ended with an average 5.4 per cent award for rubbish
collection workers, public transport and postal staff. The oTV union
leadership, which had demanded a package worth up to 11 per cent, has since
come under heavy fire from members, who rejected the award in a subsequent
ballot.
The union council, which meets on Monday, is expected to override the ballot
result and call off all action.
Germany's money supply growth continued to exceed the Bundesbank's target
range by a wide margin in April, but the rate of expansion showed a slight
slowdown from the high March level, writes Andrew Fisher in Frankfurt.
The German central bank said yesterday M3, the broad monetary aggregate,
grew at an annualised rate of 8.8 per cent last month compared with 9.4 per
cent in March (revised downwards from a preliminary 9.7 per cent) and 8.7
per cent in February.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Summer sun shines on Perot: Bush struggles with economy,
Clinton struggles to be heard

THE Memorial Day holiday on Monday marks the official start of America's
summer. But this one only brings warmth to the most unlikely presidential
aspirant of this or any other year, the billionaire from Texas, Mr H Ross
Perot.
A poll out yesterday said he had a good chance of winning in November. The
CNN-USA Today survey gave him and President George Bush 35 per cent each and
Governor Bill Clinton of Arkansas 25 per cent. Perversely, it also found
that only one in five surveyed thought Mr Perot would actually become the
next president.
Recent opinion polls have settled down to a pattern with either Mr Perot or
Mr Bush in the lead and the likely Democratic nominee third, with the gap
usually in single figures.
But a pattern is emerging in the polls, with Mr Bush seen as the strongest
only on conservative social policy issues such as law and order and either
Mr Clinton or Mr Perot ahead in the perception of their abilities to handle
every other domestic and economic problem.
This gives the lie - at least temporarily - to the widely held belief that
an improving economy will come to the president's rescue in the end. In fact
the recovery remains generally weak and regionally spotty, explaining, for
example, Mr Bush's weakness in the west, where the economy lags.
The Arkansas governor's current problem is that although he is on the verge
of securing his party's nomination he has virtually disappeared from the
media.
Given the critical scrutiny accorded Mr Clinton earlier, he might have
welcomed this relief. But the inability to make the public aware of policies
he would implement to stop inner cities erupting again has left him
marginalised.
Yesterday he did secure a national television interview. He castigated
administration social policies, and described Mr Perot as 'a brilliant sound
bite politician', adding 'people don't know what he would do, but they think
they know what he stands for and it sounds good to them.'
Mr Clinton insisted that he and Mr Perot agreed on many issues, perhaps
because they were born only 35 miles apart. But, having campaigned as the
candidate of 'change', he senses Mr Perot is stealing his clothes. 'It's
harder for me to make that case because I've been a governor and an elected
official,' he said. 'I've got to show I've got a record of actually doing
some of the things Mr Perot is talking about.'
This explicitly recognises the reason for Mr Perot's current strength - a
great lack of public confidence in the ability of the conventional political
system to deliver the economic and social goods.
If Mr Perot is vulnerable, it will probably be on his record as a ruthless
tycoon intolerant of dissent and always willing to cut corners to achieve an
end. Meanwhile Mr Clinton struggles to be heard and Mr Bush lets Mr Quayle
preach the older doctrines of conservatism. It promises to be a long, hot
summer of political discontent.

FT  23 MAY 92 / British PM seeking to draw E European countries to EC

AN initiative to establish a framework of political co-operation between the
European Community and the three Visegrad countries - Poland, Hungary and
Czechoslovakia - will be signalled next week by Mr John Major during a visit
to central Europe.
To underscore his commitment to their eventual membership of the EC, Mr
Major plans to invite the three to a joint meeting with Community leaders
after Britain assumes the presidency in July.
The aim is to reassure them that the association and trade liberalisation
agreements they have already signed with Brussels will be quickly followed
by a much broader framework of co-operation.
Mr Major will meet leaders of the three countries during visits next week to
Warsaw, Prague and Bratislava, and Budapest. The trip, his first abroad
since his general election victory last month, is intended to demonstrate a
personal commitment to intensified political links between the EC and
central Europe.
It also fits neatly with one of Mr Major's domestic political priorities -
to show Britain will lead in promoting a wider, more liberal Community.
One idea under discussion in Whitehall is that the heads of state of the
three countries should attend the EC summit in Edinburgh in December. Mr
Major is expected to raise the possibility during his talks next week with
Presidents Vaclav Havel of Czechoslovakia, Lech Walesa of Poland, and Jozsef
Antall of Hungary.
Mr Major wants to assure the Visegrad countries that the time-scale of up to
10 years envisaged for EC membership does not preclude a closer relationship
in the short term.
France and Germany yesterday supported the early enlargement of the EC to
include members of the European Free Trade Association, and urged that
membership negotiations should start as soon as possible, Ian Davidson
writes from La Rochelle.
At the end of a two-day summit in La Rochelle, President Francois Mitterrand
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said their two governments welcomed the
candidacies of those Efta countries - Austria, Sweden and Finland - which
have applied to join the Community.
The two leaders also formalised their decision to set up a Franco-German
corps of some 35,000 men, to be operational in 1995. They said the new unit
would contribute to giving the European Union its own military capacity, and
called on the other members of the nine-nation Western European Union
defence grouping to join.
They rejected US criticisms that the unit would undermine the Atlantic
Alliance.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Bonn to lift barriers against Bosnia refugees

GERMANY agreed yesterday to ease its border rules for refugees from
Bosnia-Hercegovina and urged other west European countries to do likewise.
The move came as the international community prepared to step up sanctions
against Serbia as a means of halting the bloodshed and stemming the refugee
crisis in the disintegrating Yugoslav federation.
Germany's gesture came at a meeting of Mr Rudolf Seiters, Bonn's interior
minister, and his ministerial counterparts from the 16 German states.
They agreed that Germany should open its frontiers to children and to the
sick and wounded from Bosnia-Hercegovina.
Others would be allowed into Germany if friends, relatives, churches or
humanitarian organisations undertook to house and feed them, said Mr Friedel
Lapple, the Saarland interior minister.
Still more would be allowed in if an agreement on quotas was reached with
other European countries, he said.
Mr Seiters said that 300,000 of the estimated 1.3m displaced people in the
former Yugoslavia were trapped in Bosnia-Hercegovina.
He stressed that Germany had already done more than most to help Yugoslav
refugees. Germany had allowed in about 48,000 Yugoslav asylum-seekers in the
first three months of this year, and Germany's cash contribution of DM25m
(Pounds 8.5m) formed the lion's share of EC aid promised so far to Croatia
and Slovenia.
The ministers agreed that Croatians and Bosnians already in Germany should
be allowed to stay until at least the end of September. But they insisted
that visa requirements should not be lifted and urged that all refugees be
sent back as soon as feasible when the conflict was over.
Allowing people in without visas would 'send the wrong signal' and lead to
uncontrollable immigration, Mr Seiters said.
In Vienna, officials from 10 European countries and several international
aid organisations failed to agree on more than token measures to help
Yugoslav refugees, reflecting growing helplessness in the face of Europe's
worst refugee crisis in 45 years.
They decided to send camps and supplies for 100,000 refugees to Croatia and
provide special aid for children and the injured.
Mr Alois Mock, Austria's foreign minister, termed the wave of refugees 'the
greatest political and human tragedy since the end of the Second World War'
and called for 'a massive increase in humanitarian aid'.
The United Nations agency for refugees hopes to resume sending convoys into
Bosnia soon, after deciding to suspend its operations in the republic
yesterday because of harassment by Serbs. Officials said convoys would be
suspended until talks could be held on safe passage.
UN officials were locked in negotiations with Serb leaders from Bosnia about
the return of 12 relief lorries carrying supplies of food and medicine. Serb
irregulars on Thursday seized the convoy at a checkpoint in Teslic, 90 miles
northwest of the Bosnian capital Sarajevo.
Earlier this week Serbs attacked a Red Cross convoy, leaving a Swiss relief
worker dead and two wounded.

   ROME
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Arnaldo Forlani resigned last night as secretary-general of the Christian
Democrat party after repeated failures to impose his choice of a candidate
to be selected as Italy's next president on an increasingly divided party.
His surprise resignation followed the 14th attempt by the two houses of
parliament to elect a new president. He himself had offered to resign in the
wake of the April 5 general elections when the Christian Democrats saw their
share of the vote fall below 30 per cent for the first time since the war.
However, he withdrew his resignation at the request of the party leadership
and in the early rounds of the presidential election he was twice selected
to be the Christian Democrat party candidate. But he failed to gain the
required 508-vote majority.
The field is now open for a new series of alliances to gain majority support
for a presidential candidate.
The resignation emphasised that the mood of parliament favoured a candidate
who was clearly committed to carry out and symbolise the need for
fundamental institutional reforms.

FT  23 MAY 92 / French, German farmers denounce EC reforms

FRENCH AND GERMAN farmers yesterday greeted the European Community farm
policy reforms with outrage.
Demonstrations, which broke out in France after Thursday night's agreement,
continued as farmers set fire to bundles of straw and tyres at crossroads
and protested in front of public buildings in several provincial towns.
In Rouen, a demonstrator and a policeman were slightly injured after about
100 farmers set fire to a police post at the entrance to a government
office.
Demonstrators pelted the US consulate in Bordeaux with eggs but none of the
outbursts caused serious damage. The farm unions, which had hoped for more
vigorous protests, forecast further action in coming days.
German farmers called an emergency meeting of their executive council to
decide on further action, and warned that the reforms could mean 'the
structural collapse of whole regions'.
The reform package includes a 29 per cent fall in cereal prices over three
years, a 15 per cent decline in beef price supports, with compensations on
offer. Larger farms will have to take 15 per cent of their land out of
production to get such payments
The deal was denounced as a 'folly, an economic and political mistake' and
meant 'agricultural Europe would become an American colony,' according to Mr
Raymond Lacombe, president of the Federation Nationale des Syndicats
d'Exploitants Agricoles, the main farm union. He said the price reductions
and compensations would encourage 'industrial' farming for some and leave
everyone else 'poverty stricken and marginalised'.
The German farmers' union, the DBV, declared that 'such a total
transformation' of the system was 'both wrong and disastrous.'
Mr Ignaz Kiechle, Germany's agriculture minister, in an attempt to mollify
the farm lobby, insisted that compensation payments for European farmers
must continue 'indefinitely' to make up for the drastic cuts in cereal
prices agreed in Brussels.
The EC reform package must be accepted in the Uruguay Round of trade
liberalisation talks as the bottom line, he insisted. The compensation
payments were quite simply non-negotiable.
Mr Kiechle was given explicit public support by Chancellor Helmut Kohl, who
issued a personal statement declaring that the EC agricultural reform 'was
not possible without substantial price cuts, especially for cereals'.
Mr Kohl said the deal created the preconditions for a successful end to the
Gatt talks, and asked the other Gatt partners to show a 'readiness to
compromise.'
Mr Louis Mermaz, the French farm minister, echoed this, insisting that the
package was not for renegotiation. He tried to console farmers by arguing
that incomes would 'not only be maintained but will even be improved because
the fall in prices will be fully compensated for by aids, whatever the size
of farm'.
Meanwhile, Mr John Gummer, UK minister of agriculture, warned that consumers
faced a continuing rise in food bills, in spite of the EC agreement.
However, he estimated that over a three-year period prices would be 2 per
cent lower than they otherwise would have been.
Mr Gummer was praised in the House of Commons by government supporters for
the substantial British contribution to the reform package.

FT  23 MAY 92 / CBI sees signs of recovery but output still falls
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER NORMAN and EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S economy continued to shrink in the first quarter of this year, but
a new industrial trends survey from the Confederation of British Industry
suggested last night that recovery may now be under way after the longest
recession since the 1940s.
The government announced yesterday that UK gross domestic product fell by
0.6 per cent in the first quarter and was 1.5 per cent lower than a year
before.
According to Central Statistical Office estimates, UK output, excluding oil
and natural gas production, fell 0.4 per cent in the three months - the
seventh successive quarter of decline since this measure of activity reached
a peak after the boom of the late 1980s.
However, the CBI, in its May survey of 1,277 industrial companies, reported
that many UK manufacturers 'have seen a marked improvement in home and
export orders from low levels in the past few weeks' and expect to increase
output over the next four months.
Mr David Wigglesworth, chairman of the CBI's economic situation committee,
said there were 'several welcome signs in the survey to indicate that the
economic downturn may be coming to an end'. But he warned that industry's
order books remained well below normal and recovery was likely to be slow.
This view was endorsed by CBI economists. They revised down their forecast
of UK growth to 0.9 per cent this year from 1.7 per cent previously and
warned that the recovery would be 'bumpy'.
Yesterday's GDP figures mean that UK economic output has contracted by 4.2
per cent since its peak in the second quarter of 1990 but the decline -
although long - has been less steep than the 5.5 per cent fall recorded in
the 1979-81 recession.
Although the CBI predicted that growth would quicken to 2.9 per cent next
year, it stressed that its forecast was subject to downside risks.
Underlining the muted nature of the anticipated recovery, it said the
pre-recession level of economic activity would only be attained by the third
quarter of next year.
Yesterday's worse-than-expected GDP figures and tentatively upbeat outlook
from the CBI came at the end of a week of similarly mixed economic
statistics. News early in the week of the first quarterly increase in
manufacturing output since the start of the recession was followed by mildly
disappointing retail sales figures for April.
On Thursday, a Bank of England report that bank and building society lending
rose a seasonally adjusted Pounds 5.1bn last month raised hopes.
Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's trade spokesman, said yesterday's figures were
'grim'.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Lloyds vows to fight on for Midland: Hongkong Bank given
clear run after Heseltine decision to refer rival bid to MMC
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY, RALPH ATKINS and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LLOYDS BANK said last night it would continue its fight to buy Midland Bank,
its UK rival, in spite of the decision yesterday by Mr Michael Heseltine,
trade and industry secretary, to refer the proposed bid to the Monopolies
and Mergers Commission.
Mr Heseltine also said there was no reason for UK authorities to review
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's agreed Pounds 3.4bn takeover of
Midland. This leaves Hongkong Bank with a clear field to pursue its bid.
Lloyds said it was confident it could persuade the MMC that its bid was not
against the public interest and that it would consider sympathetically
making any undertakings to ensure this was the case.
'It's disappointing but not exactly surprising,' said Mr Brian Pitman,
Lloyds chief executive. He would be writing to Midland shareholders telling
them that they lost nothing by ignoring Hongkong Bank's offer.
'I am advised that should the Hongkong Bank offer fail they (Hongkong Bank)
have the ability to make a new offer after the MMC inquiry even if Lloyds is
not cleared to bid (by the MMC),' Mr Pitman said.
As widely predicted, Mr Heseltine said Lloyds' proposed bid raised
competition issues in the UK market which deserved referral to the MMC.
The MMC has been asked to produce its ruling by August 25. Only if the bid
is cleared could Lloyds make a formal offer.
Midland's shareholders therefore have to accept or reject Hongkong Bank's
merger proposal before the MMC has ruled whether to allow Lloyds'
considerably higher proposed bid.
Some institutional investors yesterday expressed disappointment, saying they
would have preferred to see either both bids referred or neither.
One Scottish fund manager said: 'I'm going to be a holdout.' He said he
believed Hongkong Bank would be forced to improve its bid before the offer
expired on June 9.
Mr Heseltine's decision was widely welcomed at Westminster where many
Conservative MPs are afraid a successful Lloyds bid would cost jobs and
reduce competition in retail banking.
A Lloyds takeover could result in the loss of some 1,100 bank branches and
more than 30,000 staff according to the Banking, Insurance and Finance
Union. Under the Hongkong proposal, Midland would retain its management and
identity and its network would stay intact.
Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank chairman, said Mr Heseltine's ruling meant
his was the only firm offer for Midland.
'It is one which the Midland board has supported from the outset, which
fully recognises the value of Midland and its strong UK franchises,' he
said.
The decision was also welcomed by Bifu, which interpreted Mr Heseltine's
decision as support for its opposition to the Lloyds bid. Mr Heseltine said
his reference did not pre-judge the issue of whether the merger was against
the public interest.
His decision is the latest blow to Lloyds' proposed Pounds 3.7bn bid. On
Thursday. Sir Leon Brittan, the European Community competition commissioner,
said there was no need for a lengthy investigation into Hongkong Bank's
merger proposal as the two banks competed in different sectors.
In spite of the apparent setback, some institutional shareholders said that
Lloyds, though bloodied by Mr Heseltine's decision, was not out of the
fight. Shareholders are also aware that the Lloyds bid, if allowed by the
MMC, would represent a rare opportunity to rationalise an industry where
there is overcapacity. Such a move could raise the financial returns from
the sector in the long term.
Some Tory MPs remained worried that the Hongkong bid had been given an
unfair advantage and that the two bidders were not on a level playing field.
Lloyds's shares fell 3p to 427p, while Midland's share price rose 6p to
405p.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Dispatches: Orphans of the Afghan storm
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILLIAN TETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE day that Dr Najibullah, the former Afghan president, was deposed from
power in Kabul, Bagher Odrat, headmaster of an Afghan 'orphanage' in former
Soviet Tajikistan, was faced with a dilemma.
Should he take down the portraits of Najibullah that plastered the walls of
this remote institution several hundred kilometres from Afghanistan? Or
should he leave them as a memento to the regime that had now collapsed?
'Normally, of course, we would take them down,' he says, sitting in his
shabby office, nervously sipping green tea from a bowl. Outside the window a
gaggle of rainsoaked Afghan children go back and forth across the yard.
'After all, everything has changed,' he adds melodramatically.
But the problem, he explains, is the children. When the black and white
Najibullah photos disappeared from their classrooms, they staged a
rebellion: one by one they had picked up the photos and pinned them back on
the walls.
'These children have grown up loving Najibullah and 'grandpa' Lenin . . .It
is difficult to explain to them.' admits Odrat with a wry shrug.
In the coming months Odrat will have a lot more explaining to do. For the
ramshackle orphanage he presides over, in the depths of the Tajik
countryside, is no ordinary one. Set up for Afghan children back in the
early days of Soviet power in Afghanistan, for more than ten years it has
been training - or indoctrinating - a generation of Sovietised Afghan
children.
The Soviets claimed that this has been done for humanitarian reasons. Every
year scores of illiterate 'orphans' have been brought from war ridden
corners of Afghanistan to orphanages such asOdrat's.
Once behind the blue and white orphanage walls, they have been receiving an
intensive communist education - an education that was designed, Odrat says,
to transform them into doctors, engineers and teachers, ready to serve
Soviet Afghanistan.
According to anti-Soviet Afghan Mujahideen, the real role of these
orphanages has been rather more sinister. They believe these orphanages have
been training the children - most of whom were not orphans anyway  - as
spies and soldiers.
Either way, the collapse of the regime in Afghanistan has left the 'orphans'
looking like yet another sad casualty of the Afghan war. For, after ten
years of exile from their native Afghanistan, these Najibullah-loving
children are now under pressure to return to 'home', as the money to support
the orphanages fast runs out.
'When I think about it, I feel a little scared,' admits Farhod, a
12-year-old from Badakhshan, the mountainous province in the east of
Afghanistan. Like many children there, he is not a real orphan, but was sent
eight years ago by his father, a colonel in the Soviet-backed army. He is
not sure if his father is still alive. But he recently received a letter
from a cousin, asking him to return to Badakhshan.
'I'd rather stay here and become a doctor,' he says slowly, chewing
incessantly on a grimy piece of bubblegum. With his tattered tracksuit and
gap-toothed smile, he seems an unlikely candidate for a surgeon - or spy.
His friend, seven-year-old Rasul, is rather more forthcoming: 'When I grow
up I want to drive a tank, with a big gun that goes 'boom]' he says with a
lisp.
Across the muddy courtyard, dotted with placards proclaiming 'Peace to the
World]', Sadiqa has more practical matters on her mind. Her father, a bank
clerk, has also suddenly resurfaced - and asked her to go 'home.' However,
she fears that back in Kabul she will have to wear a veil. Up until now she
has always dressed in so called 'Russian clothes' - cheap, acrylic blouses
and skirts.
'We are trying to prepare them to return home, to tell them about their
culture,' explains Elena, a Russian teacher.
As the school's official 'history' teacher, she used to drill the pupils in
the principles of Marxism. Now, along with some Tajik teachers, she has been
co-opted into the incongruous task of teaching the Koran.
'Afghanistan is now a Moslem regime - the children have to prepare for that.
They cannot live in Russia,' she adds, standing in a classroom that was
recently converted into a tiny mosque.
Along the corridor, Russian language signs are being replaced by the Persian
script. A mural titled 'Communist heroes of the Afghan army' has been
discretely covered by pastel coloured posters describing the wildlife of
Asia. And plans are afoot, she says, to take down the ten foot high painting
of 'grandpa' Lenin frolicking with lambs and children in a flower-strewn
meadow.
But what about Najibullah? I asked cautiously, looking at a dour poster of
the man who Mujahideen groups are vying to kill.
She smiled uncertainly. Maybe he would be removed next month, she mumbled -
or, at least, when the children weren't looking.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Hawks &amp; Handsaws: Have a prawn, mate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HAVE YOU ever met Rupert Murdoch? If you haven't, you can take it from me
that what they say about him is true - that to your face he can be charming
and bashful, almost boyish, even though his skin is now cracked by age and
his voice has turned raspy. It is only after he has left that it dawns on
you that what he really wanted to do was reach for you like a Cape York croc
and rip your head off.
I met him again this week, for he summoned me to the Savoy and fed me prawn
sandwiches. The purpose of the interview was to establish whether I was
suitable to fill the new Rupert Murdoch chair of language and communications
at Oxford University.
News International has contributed Pounds 3m to create the chair, and the
name of the first professor is expected soon.
'Now then, mate,' said the aged proprietor. 'Let's start with a vocabulary
test. Nothing snooty-nosed. Plain and simple language, that's what I like to
hear. What is rocking-horse manure?'
'Rocking-horse manure,' I said, 'is a term for any non-existent commodity.
It's what they found in Robert Maxwell's pension funds after he was gone.'
'Jolly good,' beamed the famed proprietor. 'Ratbag?'
'A foolish person.'
'Pie-eater?'
'Person of no importance.'
'Possie?'
'Position or place, as in 'Not a bad possie, eh mate?''
'Bull's wool?'
'A tall tale.'
'Whacko,' said the dreaded proprietor. 'Now give me a few examples of
similes in general use. Nothing elitist, mind.'
I smiled winsomely. 'Dressed like a pox doctor's clerk,' I said. 'Awkward as
a Chow on a bike. Lousy as a bandicoot. Mad as a meat-axe. As game as Ned
Kelly.'
'Ripper,' said the awesome proprietor. 'Now tell me this: who is Clive
Soley, and why do I loathe him?'
'Clive Soley,' I replied, 'is a Labour party housing spokesman. He is
absolutely troppo (one who acts as if mentally disturbed). He is introducing
a private member's bill in the House of Commons which seeks to compel
newspaper editors to balance news stories by giving at least two sides of an
argument.
'More proof of his madness is that he wants to limit how many newspapers a
proprietor can control, as well as how much satellite and terrestrial
television he can own.
'According to this dingbat: 'It is not good enough, in a monopolistic
situation, to run opinions as news stories without balancing them with other
opinions.' Clive Soley is sinister and dangerous. The full might of the
media must be directed at hounding him from public life.'
Rupert Murdoch roared with laughter and clapped his hands. His chin was
stained with prawn juice. 'And who,' he asked playfully, 'is David R Jones?'
I was now suffused with confidence. Good old Rupe, I thought, he's bowling
me easy balls.
I frowned with appropriate gravitas. 'David R Jones,' I said, 'is another
sinister and dangerous man. He is deputy managing editor of The New York
Times.
'Recently, discussing trends in the US press, he said that too many US
newspapers 'have refused to take less return on their investment. They are
not prepared to invest in their future.'
'A year ago, said Jones, The New York Times had spent Dollars 5m expanding
its sports coverage in the midst of a recession. 'I cannot point,' he said,
'to one extra reader or advertiser that we got out of it, but we knew we had
to do it to keep improving the newspaper. Unless you spend more, and accept
that you'll take less profit, you give the opposition a chance to do you
down . . .''
We sat there, Rupe and I, as stunned as mullets; ashen were our faces.
Finally, the feared proprietor cleared his throat. 'Just two more
questions,' he said weakly. 'What do you think of the Queen?'
'Ripper,' I said.
'The police?'
'Ripper.'
'Whacko,' said Rupert Murdoch. 'You are a most impressive young man. My
people will be in touch.'
And then he swirled away, just like a Queensland croc, leaving me
immobilised by a black, implacable terror.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Private View: Palestine's front-line philosopher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE Scud missiles dropped on Tel Aviv, Sari Nusseibeh sat in Ramla jail
reviewing a book on medieval logic.
Locked in a small cell for 23 hours a day, he also studied the Koran and
other texts borrowed from Shi'ite Moslems detained on the same block. He
corrected the proofs of his own book, No Trumpets, No Drums, a manifesto for
a two-state Palestine written with Mark Heller, an Israeli defence expert,
who was at the same moment sheltering at home with his gas mask on.
Nusseibeh is a Palestinian from an old Jerusalem family, a philosophy
professor educated at Oxford and Harvard, and - these days - leading adviser
to the Palestinian negotiators at the Middle East peace talks.
His arrest 12 days after the Gulf War began was due, apparently, to the
interception of a phone call he received from the Iraqi ambassador in Tunis.
The Israeli Press (though not the detention order itself) accused him of
spying.
'The first night they came and took me to a reception centre,' he said.
'They put me in a cell with a lot of criminals, both Arabs and Jews, drug
addicts and so on, who were very excited that I was there.
'Then the radio started saying I was in because I was an Iraqi spy who was
directing the Scud missiles. Of course, I was afraid of them. But the
fantastic thing was their reaction was totally the opposite. It was: 'Look
at all this bullshit they're saying about you.' They didn't believe it. But
of course other, more educated, people in Israel and elsewhere might have
been ready to believe it.'
It was not the first time the mild-mannered logician had been in trouble.
After undergraduate days at Christ Church, Oxford, he had given up politics
to bury his nose in Frege's symbolic logic, which he studied with Quine in
the US, and in the metaphysics of Ibn Sina (Avicenna), the 11th century
interpreter of Aristotle, for a Harvard PhD on Islamic philosophy.
But politics was waiting for him when he came home to teach at Bir Zeit,
best known of the Arab universities set up in the Israeli-occupied West
Bank. (The Israelis closed the university in 1988, reopening it only last
month.) Meanwhile he had married Lucy Austin, daughter of the celebrated
Oxford philosopher JL Austin.
'Having lived in a world of pure ideas, I was suddenly dropped into the
middle of the real world in which, looking around me, I found the problems a
total mystery. I had to go through a new process of learning,' he said.
He fought for academic freedom at Bir Zeit in defiance of Israeli
restrictions on texts, courses and students, and set up a lecturers' union.
For several years he was forbidden to cross into Jordan. The English
language weekly report he started on the intifada, the Arab uprising, was
banned. His East Jerusalem office was closed for three years.
'There was a lot of harassment,' he told me. 'I was brought in for
interrogation on several occasions. Then there was a lot of press talk of my
having been involved with directing the intifada. Some said I had given them
money for various activities.'
Nusseibeh has denied being a member of the Palestine Liberation
Organisation. He is certainly an activist, though regarded as a moderate
both by western diplomats and by PLO militants (who in 1986 beat him up for
it.)
I met him in his mother's house in the Nablus Road, one of the handsome
stone villas built outside the walls of Old Jerusalem, right on the former
partition line. Its reception rooms resembled a Parisian salon. On the wall
was a portrait of Sari's late father, Anwar, a minister in the Jordanian
cabinet, ambassador to London and governor of Jerusalem.
I found the son friendly, donnishly courteous and with an impish air. He has
an ironical way of speaking, and a flinty eye which suggests a gift for
sarcasm.
I asked him whether his philosophical training carried weight with his
comrades. Do they rely on you for a wisdom you don't possess?
'No. In real life everyone is a wise man. In order to make your advice heard
you have to do more than be a wise man. It's not enough to think you know
what should be done, but necessary to be involved enough to make it happen.'
How much are these negotiations for you an exercise in comprehension and
logic, I asked, and how much a matter of emotion? How do you regard the
state of Israel?
'Well, frankly I would have preferred it if there were no Israel and no
Israelis to contend with. Obviously, an all-Arab Palestinian state in all of
Palestine would be for me a preferable option.
'On the other hand you have to contend with reality; therefore you have to
make compromises. You have to learn how to make those compromises in a way
that best protects your interests.'
We discussed the different motivations of Israeli and Palestinian
peace-seekers. Nusseibeh said:' I don't ask myself whether the Jews have the
moral right to be here or not. I don't think it's a necessary question. Nor
do I ask who did what to whom first.'
You don't seek to apportion blame?
'I find this a total waste of time. I think one should begin from here and
see what one can do.'
But in going forward, I said, you have to take some account of where you've
been. Do you think the Palestinian leadership played its hand badly in the
past, that its response to the fact of Israel and subsequent encroachments
was so hostile as to make it incapable - until now - of finding a
compromise?
'I know what you mean. But I think you have to be very careful here. You
could look at it mathematically or logically and say had the Palestinians or
Arabs done this or that in 1947 or whenever then things might have been
different; therefore they were wrong to do what they did. However this is a
very cold, unsympathetic way of looking at things. In a sense it's true, but
in a sense also not realistic.
'Take my parents' generation for instance, who start from the point of view
that this is all theirs, that the Jews have no right here. As far as they
are concerned the Jews came from outer space.'
(Nusseibeh's family believes it came from the Saudi desert at the time of
Caliph Umar who conquered Persia, Syria and Palestine in the seventh century
AD. In the 13th century the family became keyholders of the Church of the
Holy Sepulchre, an office it still performs.)
There were two kinds of equitable settlement, Nusseibeh continued. One was
government of the land equally shared in a single, bi-national, state. The
other was a land divided in two states.
'Both sides seem to find this option preferable, the Israelis because they
want a predominantly Jewish state, the Palestinians because they want to
assert their national self-determination - which you have to address if you
want to be free of nationalism.'
I asked him about Palestinian opposition to the talks and tensions within
the PLO. Is the tension between people in Palestine and those outside?
'This is a general misconception. The distinctions don't break down into
inside and outside. They can be between brother and brother. The
insider-outsider differences are other. Outsiders are wealthier, for
example.'
Or they're at Harvard University?
'Or they're at Harvard, exactly. People are for or against negotiations
regardless of where they happen to be.'
Are you just waiting for a change of government in this country on June 23?
'Well, I believe it is impossible for us to move forward until then. I do
not expect Likud (the right-wing governing party) to change its ideology,
and I do not expect the Americans to put sufficient pressure on it to make
it give up. So the only alternative is a change of government.
'It's now very much up to the Israeli man in the street, the voter, who is
being presented with two kinds of option.' Nusseibeh described the choice as
the chance of a peaceful life, with economic progress and integration, or
perpetual isolation and hardship. It was one of the more crucial decisions
in Israel's history, he added.
So is it for you a matter of negotiating from Israeli weakness rather than
from Arab strength?
'Yes, absolutely. I mean Shimon Peres in the Labour Party has been saying:
'we have won the battle of the past, we have been able to create a state,
but we still have the battle for the future. And to guarantee ourselves a
place in the future we have to give something back. We have to make
compromises with the Palestinians.''
But maybe they are prepared to live indefinitely in a half-world, I said,
neither formally annexing the west bank and Gaza, nor handing them over,
while continuing to build settlements.
'I think they have come to realise, some of them, that if they continue
along this path, very soon it's going to be irreversible. Very soon they
will have to decide: do they want to be an undemocratic state in 'Greater
Israel' or a democratic state in the Land of Israel. That's why this is a
critical juncture.'

FT  23 MAY 92 / Not in polite circles but . . .: Dominic Lawson thinks
bankers visit the real world only occasionally
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE ARE certain topics which I believe it is boorish to talk about in
polite company - in which category I include the readers of this column.
These include, in no particular order of preference or distaste: property
prices, the environment, and Association Football. But, on occasion, needs
must.
I was amused to read the conclusions of the experts in last Weekend FT's
residential property supplement. Lloyds Bank was quoted as forecasting a
'3.25 per cent nominal increase' in house prices over the coming year.
UBS Phillips &amp; Drew shaded its forecast down to a picky 2 per cent. The
Woolwich Building Society per contra, stuck its collective neck out, and
plumped for '4.3 per cent.'
How do all these people arrive at such incredibly precise figures? And why
is it that all these worthies year after year never forecast that prices
will actually fall in nominal terms?
They surely do not need reminding that almost exactly 12 months ago they
were all standing up to proclaim that the revival in the residential
property market had arrived.
I can only assume that they are as keen now as they were then to continue to
expand their lending in the housing market, and do not want to scare away
the punters.
I do not know any sane man who is ever sure of the current value of his own
property, let alone is willing to hazard what the price of some unknown
property will be in 12 months' time. But there seems to be a deep
psychological need to value property as though bricks and mortar were
comprised of nothing more than a pile of bank notes, and that it is simply a
matter of counting these lumped-together bank-notes to arrive at a precise
value.
A fortnight ago, a leading Sunday newspaper published its eagerly awaited
annual supplement, listing the wealth of the richest people in Britain: poor
old Lord Cadogan, owner of 100 acres of Chelsea, is now worth only Pounds
250m.
Last year, apparently, he was worth Pounds 400m. What would actually happen
if the crusty old war hero were to attempt to sell all his property, to find
out if the Sunday papers were right? He could not. The market would collapse
utterly, beyond even the forecasting ability of Lloyds Bank.
The late Texan billionaire, Lamar Hunt, used to say that, if you knew how
much you were worth, then you were not really rich.
Very droll, but in fact the remark applies to almost all of us with any
assets worth the name. I, for example, am probably richer than the Reichmann
brothers, but I do not know that I am. Late last year Fortune magazine said
that the Reichmanns were the fourth richest people in the world, worth
Pounds 7.8bn. Then I thought the Reichmanns were richer than I, and they
would probably have agreed, in their modest way. Now I read that their
assets are worth CDollars 15bn, and that their net debts are also CDollars
15bn.
By my reckoning, that gives me a greater net worth than the Reichmanns.
Perhaps, for they are, as I say, modest men, they might agree with that,
too.
I am also richer than Donald Trump, far richer. But Trump would probably not
agree. He, like his unfortunate bankers, seems to believe in what my Oxford
philosophy tutor would describe as the phenomenological concept of richness.
This states that there is no such thing as rich, but only perceptions of
richness. So to be 'rich' is merely to be believed by people to be rich. In
spite of their great tumble, the Reichmann brothers are perceived as being
richer than Dominic Lawson, so, therefore, they are richer. This means that
they still have far more chance of squeezing Dollars 100m out of a friendly
banker than I do, and, although by that act they would become Dollars 100m
poorer (still more debts), the world would think of them as Dollars 100m
richer.
Perhaps this is what lies behind the meretricious property price forecasts
of the banks and building societies. They have lent so much money on the
security of property that they must tell themselves over and over again
that, in spite of all the evidence of their eyes, their collateral is
appreciating. Mankind - even bankers - can stand only so much reality.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Arts: Captital concert hall for Athens - A triumph of space,
planning and acoustics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOVABLE, chaotic, incomparable in its relics and in the ugliness of its
modern buildings, Athens is not a city of which exciting innovations can
generally be expected. Images familiar to the international eye tend to
focus upon streets locked in traffic jams and skies coated with
life-threatening pollution haze - not the Acropolis. It is also a city whose
cultural institutions have long been characterised by their stagnation,
brackish pools of special-interest domination, intrigue and hand-to-mouth
mediocrity.
Of European capitals it is, therefore, not the first to spring to mind as
the likely home of a magnificent new concert hall. But that, as I found out
last weekend, is exactly what the new Megaron Mousikis Athenon must be
judged: a triumph of intelligent space-planning, fine architectural
execution and - most important of all, of course - inviting acoustics.
The only concert hall in Greece, it is the achievement of two groups of
music-lovers, the Society of the Friends of Music and OMMA, who together
bulldozed their way through numerous obstacles, attracting state and private
money in the process. It was inaugurated last year, 25 years after the
foundation was laid, having taken four years and Dollars 1 billion
(one-sixth, I was proudly informed, of the Paris Bastille) to build. It was
designed by a team of European architects who came on board - crucial point
 -only after the consultative acousticians had compiled their list of
requirements.
Though minor finishing touches have still to be applied, its obvious success
is already causing an exhilarating new vitality to ripple through the
artistic life of the whole country. The Megaron is two halls - the
2,000-seater Friends' Hall and the 500-seater Dimitri Mitropoulos -
connected and surrounded by what seems airy acres of foyer, apt for
exhibitions, lunchtime and early-evening recitals, or simple relaxation and
refreshment. Different, wonderful kinds of marble make up the substructure
and surfaces; fastidious care has been taken over decorative details such as
the foyer seating, lights and 'signature' emblems embedded in the marble
flooring.
The ambitions of the hall management do not end with simply providing a
decent house for music-making. The provision for conferences and recording
facilities, a new home-based chamber orchestra and a thematic slant to
programme-building are just some of the signs of determination to make the
place a real artistic force. (Significantly the Greek National Opera is not
being allowed any important role in the activities of the Megaron.)
The first 'theme' is that of Electra, in all her various dramatic
manifestations (next year's will be Helen of Troy). An Electra Cycle began
on May 2 with Xenakis's completed Oresteia and continued last weekend with
three performances of Strauss's Elektra with the Dresden Philharmonic
Orchestra. Other items on the way to the closing date (June 20) will include
a Moscow Taganka staging (in the small hall) by Yury Lyubimov of Sophocles's
Electra, a new chamber opera, Pylades, by the Greek composer George
Kouropos, and the Bolshoy Ballet in Grigorovich's Electra.
As all this suggests, the halls are intended to be multi-purpose. The
quick-change possibilities of the handsomely wood-surfaced Friends' Hall
seemed to me quite astonishing: when it is scheduled for fully-staged opera,
such as this Elektra, the removal of whole side-boxes of audience seats can
be accomplished with remarkable ease. There is no covered pit; for the
Strauss the Dresden Philharmonic was laid out, open and in all its vastness,
at a level below the stage.
This may have provided a slight visual distraction, in this of all operas;
but the unclotted fullness and beauty of the orchestral sound in all its
panoply of Straussian combinations, and the way all the voices were allowed
to soar above it, certainly testified to the excellence of the acoustics.
The purposeful warmth of the bass line - how clean and ample the Dresden
cellos, double basses and low brass sounded] - reinforced my admiration for
the 'neurasthenic' brilliance of Strauss's Elektra orchestration. But every
facet of this extraordinary score sounded new-polished - and this was in
spite of the ungripping conducting, honest, able but workaday, of Ralf
Weikert.
The production by Claus Helmut Drese, the ex-Vienna State Opera boss, was
likewise no more than middling, with 'ideas' about costume notable only for
their thudding ineffectiveness. The pleasure lay in the singing; the cast
was on the top level of current Elektra standards. Indeed, after worrying
reports of her recent New York encounter with the title role, it was a
relief to hear Hildegard Behrens returned to vocal health: in any case, her
ability to rise radiantly above natural vocal limitations is always a source
of wonder.
At the second of the two performances I attended, the heroine was Evanghelia
Antoninia, a highly promising young Greek currently active in Germany - but
the voice, more Chrysothemis than Electra, is in danger of being
overstretched by this most ferociously demanding of dramatic-soprano roles.
Eva Randova (Clytemnestra, in terrific form), Nadine Secunde (Chrysothemis)
and Horst Hiestermann (Aegisthus) were common to all three evenings, and
well routined. Elektra was a splendid test of the acoustics. I cannot wait
to get back to Athens, and get to know the Megaron in all its other
manifestations.

<TEXT>
IT IS delightful to see an old-fashioned West End problem-play again. The
genre is thought to be dead; to find a close parallel to Roy Kendall's
semi-new piece (originally staged in Watford a decade ago, now 'reworked'
with the director Val May), you'd have to search old volumes of Plays of the
Year. Yet Body and Soul revives the formula with some zest, and May has
staged it with exemplary sympathy at the Albery Theatre. A formula it
remains; but it doesn't insult your intelligence, and it goes down quite
pleasantly.
The problem is (God help us) the ordination of women priests in the C. of E,
and in the time-honoured way the stage is peopled with defenders of
irreconcilable views. As usual, the playwright is at undisguisable pains to
flesh out characters who are really there to illustrate the debate. Kendall
does that with the hand of a practised TV scriptwriter. Good enough; on this
wonderfully archaic question, there is no room for anything like rational
argument, and he is savvy enough to disdain cheap laugh-lines.
For the saving twist is that his heroine is not a militant religieuse, but a
gentle transsexual: a properly ordained, conscientious vicar when s/he was
still Christopher, and keen now to continue her vocation as Christine.
Naturally her Bishop is the man who must face up to the dilemma, and
naturally he is a chap of cautiously liberal views who must consult experts
in canon law. Naturally too he has a wife who is passionately committed to
the feminine cause, and ready to hint at divorce if Christine is sacked; for
theatrical purposes, that enlivens their domestic life considerably.
Thus Kendall can get away with staging plain debates between the Bishop (who
naturally utters the F-word just once, prompting a gasp from the stalls) and
his ecclesiastical chums. The chums are cast prudently from strength: Hugh
Sullivan as the decent legal go-between, Peter Cellier representing smug
pedantic authority, Moray Watson a ripely quirky Archbishop of York.
If the homely details of the Bishop's hitherto becalmed life are a bit
routine - he is a drinking man and a hockey fanatic, his wife frustrated and
a touch stroppy - Robert Hardy and Angela Thorne transfuse them, like the
good professionals they are. Hardy could play the Bishop in his sleep, but
in fact he is alert and disarmingly energetic beyond the call of duty; Miss
Thorne is not afraid to sound strident from time to time, which lends useful
grit to her character amid the comfy West End naturalism.
Christine might have been a problem: naturally an actress must play her  -
an actor in drag would queer the pitch of the debate - and naturally she
must be the soul of sweetness and unpretentious piety, neither a mere
obsessive nor a rude troublemaker. (A discreet veil is left over just how
s/he was driven to the surgeon's knife.) Nicola Redmond, conveniently tall
in flat heels and wielding a husky contralto, rescues her triumphantly.
Glowing with intelligent, down-to-earth sincerity, she also radiates hints
of private stress with which she will not burden anybody else - nor test the
frail dramatic construct too hard: perfect. Embattled C. of E-ers will find
it all rivetting, and even disinterested parties, or deeply uninterested
ones like me, may find themselves drawn in.
As Marlene Dietrich sped to her final rest in a 1950s Cadillac last week,
the Royal Shakespeare Company fine-tuned its stage version of the film that
made her famous. The Blue Angel has transferred from The Other Place,
Stratford, to The Globe. The show still entertains, but lacks its original
edge. Trevor Nunn's production of Pam Gems' play-of-the-film-of-the-book has
coarsened and dwindled in the transfer from Stratford.
While The Other Place studio felt like the eponymous nightclub, with
audience on three sides of the stage, the large stage at the Globe
dissipates the intimate intensity which made the studio version work. The
story is tried and tested. A middle-aged school Professor becomes besotted
with a Hamburg nightclub chanteuse, Lola; they marry, he is ostracised, and
so starts to blackmail his way onto the social register.
Heinrich Mann's 1905 original, Professor Unraat Oder Das Ende Eines Tyrannen
and Josef von Sternberg's 1930 film, Der Blaue Engel, allowed the European
middle-class to frown at the Professor's foolishness, and the New World to
smile knowingly at his rediscovered sexuality. This new staging exposes the
play's weaknesses. The Blue Angel feeds off the popularity of Der Blaue
Engel, but has strayed too far from its originals to deliver the degree of
social and psychological comment available in them. Now the love story is
less engaging, the play's politics, concerned with class hypocrisy and
nationalism in 1920s Germany, are too slight to bear scrutiny.
The play has evolved into a vaudeville act lead by a surefooted director.
The edgy songs of Friedrich Hollander and Mischa Spoliansky are here less
germane and more incidental to a plot which was, like Lola's attire,
shamelessly flimsy. The performance, like Maria Bjornson's set, has become
shallower. The principals appear against a flatter background. But the
considerable talents of Kelly Hunter as Lola, Philip Madoc as Professor
Raat, and Sidney Livingstone as the Angel's MC keep the show buoyant.
Hunter's singing, especially of Hollander's 'Nimm' Dich in Acht vor Blonden
Frauen' ('Beware Blondes') and 'Jonny' has become fuller. But overall, a
fine studio production now risks becoming forgettable main-house kitsch.

TOMORROW, Radio 4 begins Who believes in Britain?, a series not political
but religious, presented in fact by the BBC's Religious Affairs
Correspondent, Mike Wooldridge. It is to examine the condition of six
religions current in Britain - Christianity, Buddhism, Hinduism, Islam,
Judaism and Sikhism.
It rightly begins with Christism, as we should call it consistently, but
hardly takes a general view by setting off in Belfast. Here churchgoing is
commoner than on the mainland of Britain, but even so, the numbers are going
down. One citizen interviewed on mixed marriage said 'I don't see any
difference.' A student complained that the church lacked spontaneity and
fun. In the Bristol area (where one adult in ten goes to church, and one
child in seven) we dealt largely with charity - 'consumer Christianity' as
someone called it. It covered a broad ground, from the Jesus Bus that
distributes coffee; the Bristol Group, who sing and speak in tongues; the
black Bethel United, 'people like anybody else'.
There was little talk about doctrine, even in Belfast. It will be
interesting to learn if such differentiations exist within the other five
religions to be dealt with.
The use of belief to serve ones ends was shown last Saturday in A Matter of
Conscience, about conscientious objection to involvement in war. Most
wartime COs were content to accept their alternative employment (though some
farmers complained that they were idle). One who disapproved of war on
principle said he would gladly struggle for something he did believe in, but
most objectors pleaded the 'categorical imperative', thou shalt not kill.
They should go back to their Exodus: this imperative is at Chapter 20, verse
13, yet at Chapter 33, verse 27, the Lord ordered 'Go in and out from gate
to gate throughout the camp, and slay every man his brother, his companion,
his neighbour.' Three thousand were slain. One hopes that worshipping a
golden idol was something they did believe in.
Unsophisticated minds can believe in anything. The first of John McKay's
talks on Radio 4 on Sunday evenings, Aesthete's Foot, dealt with the Kirk as
misunderstood after a childhood reading of 'The Reverend's Manual' where
principles were given to help the Reverend to become as boring as expected
('always visit widows'; 'always patronise children'; 'always have heating
problems in the church hall'). McKay, who also reckons the coloured pictures
in his Bible were not for preaching but for interior decoration, is not
unsophisticated at all, but apt at detecting the state. Tomorrow he deals
with sex, the following week with Satanism.
Playwright Bill Naughton, who died in January, began as a radio writer, so
Radio 3's commemoration this week used his radio plays. Probably few people
who think of Alfie as a film know that it began in 1962 as an hour-long
radio piece, Alfie Elkins and His Little Life, and this is what we had on
Sunday. Bill Owen in the lead was fine, but it isn't much of a play. A
series of incidents in the life of a randy, dishonest working man moves
easily from seduction to seduction, with an interval for TB, ending with a
prospect of poverty that hardly adds any new quality to the generally
one-dimensional character.
On Tuesday we had a Naughton from 10 years later, The Mystery, also a radio
piece. Indeed Edward, the hero (Norman Rodway), keeps advising us to stop
listening and go out into the fresh air. Edward has been told by his wife to
take the cat and the dog to the vet to be neutered. En route, he has a brief
cuddle with his daily, and the vet and he agree that they wouldn't like to
be neutered. So both pets return home whole. The mystery is the true nature
of love.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Arts: Caro triumphs in Rome - William Packer admires the
girders adorning the Markets of Trajan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR ANTHONY Caro now occupies a unique position in British art. Conspicuous
in a generation of sculptors itself conspicuously talented - it includes
such luminaries as Paolozzi, Dalwood, Turnbull, Butler, Armitage, Meadows,
Chadwick, Kneale - that emerged in the immediate post-war years, he stands
alone, secure in a critical reputation that has continued virtually without
question these past 30 years.
Abroad, the powerful critical voices Michael Fried and Clement Greenberg
were loud in his praise, accepting him as the peer of David Smith and
setting him into the wider context of current American art, most especially
the colour-field and post-painterly minimalism of such as Kenneth Noland and
Frank Stella. At home, he turned the sculpture school of the old St Martin's
School of Art into a forcing house of younger talent, from King and Tucker
to Flanagan and Long.
In short, since the late 1960s and the retrospective that was the Hayward
Gallery's inaugural show, his has been a truly international reputation and
more general influence of a kind that his sometime mentor, Henry Moore, came
to command only in later middle age. Henry Moore was 74 when, almost 20
years ago, the city of Florence honoured him with a magnificent
retrospective exhibition, set out in the open air in the Belvedere, high
above the city. And now, at 68, it is Caro's turn, and in no less
spectacular a setting, though this time in Rome.
The Markets of Trajan, built by Apollodorus for the Emperor a little after
100 AD, survive as an extraordinary sequence of galleries, streets and
terraces set into the Quirinal Hill high above Trajan's own forum and
looking out across the heart of the ancient city to the Forum and the
Palatine beyond. The entrance is from the back, by way of the Via IV
Novembre, into a large hall beneath a massive vaulted canopy, with the
ancient shops and stalls at two levels on either side. A broader stair goes
down to the Via Biberatica, corruption of pipera, the street of pepper and
no doubt sundry spices, of which the wonderfully worn flagstones lead up
past yet more shops onto what is now more or less an open terrace.
And it is into this heavily atmospheric and imaginatively potent place, full
of ghosts, that the Italian critic, Giovanni Carandente - who was the
curator of that Moore exhibition at the Belvedere - was invited by the
British Council and the Comune di Roma to put his selection of the work of
Anthony Caro, to cover the years from 1960 to the present day.
It is evident at once that this must have been the trickiest of
undertakings, for any show in this setting must be quite as much a
celebration of the place itself as of the work as such. There is little in
the way of collective display, and even where a group of works way be seen
together, as on the terrace outside, the surviving rectilinear plan imposes
its own conceptual isolation. A glimpse here, caught through a door or
window, of another piece, and that is all there is of ensemble. The tops or
brightly painted flanks of the works from the 1960s, set out on that
terrace, may be seen from the road to the Colosseum far below, but there is
no question of looking in upon any whole battalion, set out in groups or
rows for judicious and comparative review.
These works come very much as single spies which, since Caro's shift, around
1960, away from modelling to the formal disposition of given elements,
welded or bolted, have been their essential character. We look in upon the
work, and into the very space that its component bars and girders, or
latterly the bent and folded sheets of metal or slabs of clay, articulate.
The experience of the work is thus so focussed that to come upon each piece,
set up alone in its little shop, is a positive advantage.
The huge and recent 'After Olympia', a free variation upon the temple
frieze, that was shown last year at the Tate, now commands the great
entrance hall. It is neither dominating nor dominated, yet oddly quiet, for
the light is flat and low, drained of colour, and the warm, dark masonry is
close to the sombre brown patination of the metal. High above, perched on
the upper balcony in the sunlight, sits 'Early One Morning' of 1962, bright
scarlet, light, open and emblematic, one of the first pieces by which Caro
remade his name.
All around to be discovered are the works of these past 30 years, the one
imaginatively connected to the other. Here are the variations, the
developments, the contradictions, the return to a kind of modelling, albeit
in sheet metal, the figurative references both within the imagery and by
association in the titles, and then again the denials of such associations.
Such are the inevitable complications of the creative life. But here, at the
heart of Trajan's Markets in the proximity of the very early and the most
recent, the creative thread is implicitly laid out with a touching clarity.

<TEXT>
IN DAYS gone by if you wandered into Sotheby's in Bond Street wanting to pop
an antique worth less than Pounds 1,000 you were politely directed towards
more mundane auction houses. That has all changed. Next Wednesday bids of
Pounds 500 or less might well capture a Chinese vase or a Persian rug in
Sotheby's first 'Arcade' sale of oriental art. The saleroom has gone
suddenly and dramatically down market.
The traditional view at Sotheby's was that if it had to handle
run-of-the-mill antiques it should be done decently away from central
London. Eighteen months ago it announced plans to build a vast new auction
house within dealer distance of Heathrow. At the same time it was to close
down its provincial outposts at Chester and Billingshurst. This seemed a
sensible compromise. In its ideal world Sotheby's would concentrate on
bringing in over Pounds 100m an hour selling Van Goghs and Renoirs to the
Japanese.
But now there have been second thoughts. Sotheby's profits have disappeared
as rapidly as the Japanese collectors and there is no relish for a big
property investment. Billingshurst has been reprieved and specialist sales
are to reappear at Bond Street aimed at the modestly rich who might
contemplate collecting Islamic pots, or silver, or watercolours in the
Pounds 250-Pounds 2,500 price range.
We have been here before. A few years ago Sotheby's tempted Yuppies with
evening sales of decorative antiques to furnish a Fulham terrace house or a
Kent cottage. They never caught on. But a research survey of 10,000 of its
customers has convinced Sotheby's that it must shake off its elitist image
and try and nurture the younger, less affluent, buyers, some of whom in time
might become rich collectors.
The 'Arcade' auctions mean that Sotheby's will process another 10,000 lots a
year which might eventually contribute Pounds 20m to turnover. Not only will
the new auctions be attractive to dealers, currently keen to sell off
surplus stock at auction to pay off their bank loans, but the promise of
payment within six weeks of offering antiques for sale makes Sotheby's an
attractive alternative to the pawnbroker.
The new approach is the work of Roger Faxon who came from New York last
October to run Sotheby's Europe. Another of his initiatives surfaced last
week when anyone watching Super Channel on May 15 would have seen a
Sotheby's auction of the Applied Arts televised live, with an off the
rostrum commentary by David Battie.
This was not just cheap television, or a PR boost for Sotheby's, but a
glimpse into the future. Within ten years, only a few diehards will actually
attend an auction. Potential buyers will follow the action on television and
bid from home. Indeed last week a German viewer was so taken by a 19th
century bronze that he phoned through a successful bid. Of course he was not
a total stranger to Sotheby's. You have to have an approved credit rating
before you can join in this new game show.
The British Museum has a pleasant problem - what to do with the space to be
vacated by the British Library as it starts its slow move to its new Pounds
400m home on the Euston Road? The Library actually absorbs 40 per cent of
the Museum, including its most architecturally famed hub, the Reading Room.
The Reading Room's eventual re-incarnation is still the subject of dispute,
but on Thursday a deal was signed which allows the Museum to start
re-developing some BL offices. The Korean Foundation has come up with Pounds
1.2m which will finance the British Museum's first Korean gallery in the
vacated space. The Foundation is funded by the Korean Government to spread
the nation's culture and this is its first donation.
The deal is the latest in a succession of coups which has enabled the BM to
completely refurbish its holdings of Asian art. The first was for a Japanese
gallery, paid for with Pounds 5m mainly contributed by Japanese companies
and institutions. In the autumn the new oriental gallery will re-open.
Stretching 110 metres it will be the longest single gallery in the UK. It
has cost Pounds 3.2m to refurbish, of which Pounds 2m came from the Hong
Kong businessman, Joseph Hotung. The gallery embraces both Chinese and
Indian art and culminates in a specially constructed air conditioned section
to house the Amaravati marbles from a Buddhist temple near Madras, in their
way as striking as the Elgin marbles.
The British Museum has been able to tap the growing prosperity of Asia. It
will be less easy to find the money to renovate its galleries of Western
art. Its immediate task is to find Pounds 3m to transform the other great
space soon to return to its control, the magnificent King's Library.
Mary Allen is to be the new deputy director of the Arts Council, replacing
Margaret Hyde who stuck the job for only a year. Mary Allen, who comes from
running the Waterman's Arts Centre, should have a longer stay - David Mellor
willing. The attitude of the new Minister of the National Heritage to the
Arts Council is unpredictable. On one hand he is opposed to a Quango which
takes some of the funding decisions that he likes to exercise: this suggests
the Council's role will be down graded. On the other hand Mellor is a
centralist and needs the Council to fund those arts companies that are now
less likely to be devolved to the care of Regional Arts Boards.
Everything might turn on the London Philharmonic Orchestra. Mellor used to
be on its board and has always nurtured it. The LPO does not want to be
delegated to the London Arts Board. If Mellor backs its intransigence, other
large arts organisations will also be reprieved, and the Arts Council, and
Mary Allen, will continue to have a job.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Arts: Guggenheim megalomania - As the museum reopens its
doors, Susan Moore reports on the controversial plans of its new director,
Thomas Krens
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SUSAN MOORE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NEXT month the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum in New York reopens to the
public. Its two-year closure has seen not only the restoration of Frank
Lloyd Wright's idiosyncratic masterpiece to its 'pre-original condition',
but the construction of a 10-storey annexe to provide additional gallery
space on Fifth Avenue and the creation of a new Guggenheim Museum in SoHo,
contributing a further 30,916sq ft for the display of works of art.
Under its new director, 45 year old Thomas Krens, a deal has been signed
with the Basque government to build a Dollars 98m sand-blasted steel and
concrete Guggenheim in Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, and a project mooted
for another Guggenheim to be hewn out of the rock of the Monchsberg in
Salzburg.
The museum's holdings have increased too. In 1990, the Solomon R. Guggenheim
Foundation controversially deaccessioned three paintings to finance the
Dollars 30m acquisition of 210 Minimalist paintings and sculpture from the
collection of the Italian Count Giuseppe Panza di Biumo. The foundation may
also accept the gift of his villa at Varese. If that were not enough, it has
also offered to administer an earlier Krens brainchild, a projected Dollars
87m modern art museum in economically depressed North Adams in
Massachusetts.
Shrouded by builders' hoardings and stripped of its collection, the
Guggenheim has generated more column inches in the press than any other
flourishing cultural institution. The reason is that Krens is redefining the
concept of the public museum for the late 20th century, and finding new ways
both of financing and filling it. Moreover, in terms of scale, expense and
funding, his Guggenheim resembles more a multinational business conglomerate
than a 20th century art museum. Is Krens an inspired visionary, an
irresponsible megalomaniac, or a Barnum purveying a new kind of travelling
circus?
Krens was appointed in 1988. He inherited a museum with an endowment of
Dollars 25m and an operating deficit of nearly Dollars 2m, a monument by
probably America's greatest architect in a sorry state of disrepair, and
space to exhibit only three per cent of the museum's outstanding holdings.
Now new office, storage and conservation space allows the public to see all
of the Wright building for the first time, and for it to be used exclusively
for the display of art.
The cost of the New York projects - the annexe, the restoration, the SoHo
museum on Broadway and Prince designed by Arata Isozaki, plus the new
conservation workshops and store on the Westside - is Dollars 76m. (The 27
members of the board, all of whom are expected 'to take a financial
responsibility', insist that the Guggenheim bears none of the costs of its
overseas projects. Indeed, the Basques are paying for their museum,
guaranteeing operations, paying Dollars 50m for acquisitions that complement
the Guggenheim collections, plus a Dollars 20m fee for its expertise.)
Some Dollars 54.9m has been raised by the Guggenheim Foundation issuing
tax-exempt bonds in a deal that took 12 members of staff 18 months to
negotiate and produce, in association with the Trust for Cultural Resources,
the Swiss Bank Corporation and JP Morgan. 'It is almost free money,' says
Krens. That may be so, but it has to be repaid within some 20 years. Unlike
comparable bonds issued by other cultural institutions, this one is not
secured by collateral. If the museum cannot raise the money, the
responsibility will fall on the board. If the board fails to deliver, the
museum's assets may be at risk.
'Museums often have to change in order to survive', says Krens. 'Either
their mandate, or their collection or their audience must change. There is
no such thing as a given Guggenheim, so part of what I have to do is to
anticipate the way culture is evolving as defined by museums, to articulate
a clear set of standards and objectives for the museum and translate those
into policies and programs that can be paid for.'
Krens is sticking to the museum's mandate - the 20th century. It is the
collection that is changing.
The purchase of the Panza di Biumo collection (which, ironically, can never
be deaccessioned) is consistent with Krens's stated desire to build on the
museum's qualities and strengths. The Guggenheim began life as a Museum of
Non-Objective Painting. This collection offers non-objective art of the
post-war period, with some 20 works apiece by American Minimalists such as
Robert Ryman, Richard Serra, Donald Judd, Dan Flavin, Robert Morris, Bryce
Marden and Robert Mangold.
'I believe this will be historically justified as a brilliant acquisition
for the institution. We are now the strongest museum in the world for a
particular field, 1963-1975. We own the voice', says Krens. Moreover, the
strong association of the museum with particular artists may well inspire
artists and collectors to donate works.
Work of such radical scale demands vast spaces, hence Guggenheim SoHo and
Bilbao. Krens has been accused of cultural imperialism. A far greater danger
is of his opportunism becoming predatory, or undirected. As Krens put it,
'the museum's stance and aesthetic outlook is hard to articulate.'
Undoubtedly, the Guggenheim will be 'a more efficient organisation accessing
different audiences essentially with the same product'. The implication is
that the the Guggenheim collections in New York, Venice, Bilbao and perhaps
Salzburg, will be constantly on the move. Soon we will see whether, on the
one hand, Krens and his impressive international curatorial team will
justify the museum's costly expansionist programme. On the other, will they
honour their fundamental curatorial obligations of preserving and
interpreting its rich existing holdings?

YOU HAVE to admire art dealers, especially those who trade in 20th century
British art. Sales in the past two years have been as rare as pandas yet
most have survived. Among the more unfortunate casualties has been the
Odette Gilbert gallery of Cork Street and some of her stock is being
liquidated at Christie's next month.
If you want an atmospheric Carel Weight for around Pounds 7,500 (less than
its price at the 1990 Royal Academy Summer Show); or a strident John
Bellany; or a lesser Freud, Auerbach, or Bomberg, try the sales on June 5
and 12. You could pick up a bargain.
It is ironic that a major gallery should go under just as there are signs
that the market in 20th century British art is picking up. Two sales in
London this month - a second division auction at Christie's and a sale of
important pictures at Sotheby's - have been encouraging. Very few dealers
can afford to buy more stock, but that makes the pickings better for private
collectors.
Sotheby's was lucky it had five top rank pictures from the collection of the
late Lord Walston. So confident was it of the quality, and so keen to secure
the group from the competition of Christie's, that it was tempted to offer
the executors a guaranteed sum. In the end it trusted the market and secured
auction records of Pounds 198,000 for a work by Edward Burra and Pounds
170,500 for a LS Lowry. The two Lowrys, and two Stanley Spencers, might have
made more in 1989 but compared with a decade ago these are extraordinary
prices.
Of course some modern British pictures were over-inflated and now fetch up
to 50 per cent less than their 1989 prices. But at least they are selling.
Harold Harvey is one of the sufferers, but ' A Summer Morning' went for
Pounds 16,000 last week: three years ago it might have edged Pounds 30,000;
but a year ago, unsaleable.
An excellent example of the state of the market was provided by an early
Munnings, 'In the shade'. A year ago Sotheby's offered it with an estimate
of Pounds 60,000-Pounds 80,000 and it was unsold. This time its estimate was
Pounds 40,000-Pounds 60,000 and it went for Pounds 57,500. Another Munnings,
sent for sale by a distressed Lloyds 'Name', a group of potential sellers
that Sotheby's is successfully pinpointing, made Pounds 36,300, above its
estimate.
But Munnings has always been popular. Philip Connard, bought by collectors
who could not quite afford a Laura Knight, offers an example of the fate of
middling quality early 20th century British art. His 'Windswept' was unsold
last year at Pounds 14,000 and found a buyer last week at Pounds 7,700.
By keeping the estimates low - down 20 per cent on average on 1990 -
Sotheby's managed a total of approaching Pounds 2.5m with less than 10 per
cent unsold, encouraging the market. At Christie's the task was harder -
finding buyers for less exceptional works. In the event its sale made around
Pounds 250,000 and was roughly three quarters sold.
Certain artists, Mary Fedden, Carel Weight, Dorothea Sharp, are out of
favour, but others, Augustus John, Edward Seago, Ken Howard, and
Russell-Flint, have ridden the recession well. Christie's confidently
expects a record for a painting by Robert Bevan, 'Horse dealers at the
Barbican' which it is offering, with a Pounds 70,000-Pounds 90,000 estimate,
on June 5.
Its auction of post war and contemporary art six days later may have more
difficulties. This tougher, more challenging, art has restricted appeal. The
UK is acknowledged to have produced some of the finest sculptors of the past
50 years and there are good examples of the work of Elisabeth Frink, Michael
Ayrton, Barbara Hepworth, Henry Moore, Lynn Chadwick, and more, carrying
reasonable estimates.
With the fall in the market apparently over, frustrated sellers may well be
offering more, and better, things on to the market in the autumn. But anyone
who has regained their confidence about the financial future could find this
summer an excellent time to buy art.
What more potent symbol of capitalism than an art auction? In Germany,
reunification and new east German interest in sales is making ripples in the
market which could soon become a splash. Sotheby's, on Unter den Linden
since 1990, is bullish about its modern German art sale next weekend. Villa
Grisebach, the big Berlin house, drew crowds previewing its major spring
sale (May 29 and 30) in Dresden last week.
'Nowadays, people go crazy if the Brandenburg Gate is in a picture,' says
Grisebach's Michaela Kapitzky; good news for the Expressionist renderings of
Berlin by Lesser Ury, the Jewish recluse from Silesia, in her sale at around
DM160,000. The kernel of the German market, the expressionists, Nolde,
Beckmann, Kokoshka, Kirchner, have always been bought by collectors, not
speculators, and so escaped the recent rise and crash of, say, French
Impressionists. Prices increase steadily at 8 to 10 per cent a year; the
powerhouse is German - 70 per cent of Grisebach's buyers, 90 per cent of
Sotheby's, in this sector.
Emigre art traditionally went to private Swiss or American collections,
whence come most of next week's plums. Otto Dix's portrait of Dresden
businessman Max Roesberg (Sotheby's, estimate DM350,000 to DM400,000), and
Beckmann's Neuhaus (Grisebach, estimate DM1.9m to DM2.4m - the price may
beat Germany's DM2.6m expressionist record) are both emigre American
pictures, almost certain to be bought back into Germany. Nolde's exotic
'Girl and Lilies' (Grisebach, estimate DM700,000 to DM900,000) and
Beckmann's Sea View (Grisebach, estimate DM500,000 to DM700,000),
confiscated from Cologne's risque Wallraf-Richartz Museum in 1937 to join
the Nazi Degenerate Art exhibition, both come from Switzerland.
But the latest trickle onto the market comes from the east, where art
dealing was streng verboten. Now they are the freshest pieces around -
Moedersohn's Spring on the Moor (Grisebach, estimate DM30,000 to DM40,000),
from a private Leipzig collection and previously unknown, is causing a stir.
But museums like Leipzig, given grants by Bonn to fill gaps in their
collections, are also among the new buyers.
The German market is localised - mountain scenes, which flop in Berlin, soar
in Munich - but strong, safe, immune from international recession and
speculative Anglo-Saxon habits. Recent exhibitions have spawned wider
interest. After a Berlin show, Corinth now finds favour in the US; but
artists, like Ury and Liebermann, much admired by Van Gogh, are Berlin men.
Says Reuter: 'I'd never sell a good Liebermann in New York. If it's a
Wannsee garden, you can smell it here.'

MAGRITTE by David Sylvester Thames &amp; Hudson Pounds 45, 352 pages,
illustrated
TO BECOME a fully paid-up member of the Surrealist Movement in Paris before
the Second World War and enjoy the notoriety and demand the group's
exhibitions aroused you had to get the okay from Andre Breton. And he was as
fussy about who he let in as the most rulebook-conscious trades union boss.
More than 60 years later, Magritte seems to have been the surrealist painter
par excellence; but he did not seem like that at the time to Breton.
For one thing he was Belgian and not French. That, as David Sylvester
explains, might not have mattered if Magritte had migrated permanently to
Paris to plunge whole-heartedly into the activities of the group; but as a
young painter eking out a living by commercial artwork in Brussels, Magritte
worked among a small circle of Belgian artists, writers and journalists who
had their own notions of surrealism. These derived in part from Italian
futurism and from de Chirico.
Then in September 1927 Magritte and his wife Georgette moved to Paris and
the painter's involvement in the politics of the Movement began. Magritte
started to appear in the journal, La Revolution Surrealiste, and Breton
began to acquire Magrittes. But the honeymoon was soon over. When the Second
Surrealist Manifesto was published in 1930, Magritte was not among the
signatories, and by then he and his wife had returned to Belgium for good.
Magritte's chief point of difference with the Paris-based surrealists turned
on the degree of conscious control exercised by the painter over the imagery
in the painting. Pure surrealism insists on the artist totally letting go,
on a great gush of subversive imagery welling up from the unconscious and
spilling frighteningly onto the canvas. Even in Dali's paintings, where the
the flow seems to be totally associative and uninhibited, there is too much
control for the surreal purist, and far too much for him in those of
Magritte.
When after the Second World War, a new international surrealist exhibition
opened in Paris in 1947, the official list of surrealist painters did not
include the name of Magritte; but by then he had become too important to be
wholly excluded and they compromised by hanging some of his work in the
category 'Surrealists in spite of themselves'.
At that time Magritte had, as it happened, temporarily turned away from
surrealism to experiment with a painterly parody of impressionism - a
rainbow palette applied to females a la Renoir. Some of these curiously
atypical Magritte works are included in this book, and Sylvester explores
the economic as well as the psychological motivation behind this phase of
Magritte's career. He thinks the quasi-impressionist paintings have been
under-valued and he has an even stronger admiration for the work of the
brief, violent fauve period that followed.
Magritte's dialogue with Breton was to continue for many years. Magritte
defended his combination of 'charm and menace' by reference to the Alice
books. Like Carroll, Magritte achieves his effects of witty disturbance
through a misuse of logic. Writing to his little girl friends Carroll would
pick on an expression of ordinary speech such as 'it is raining cats and
dogs' and interpret it literally; in Magritte's late, great painting
'Golconda' it is raining little men in bowler hats. Carroll's trick of
subjecting Alice's body to magnification or diminution is pure Magritte.
Sylvester distinguishes several more types of distortion employed regularly
by Magritte - displacement, defiance of gravity, transparency, and in some
beautiful late grisaille paintings, petrification; in these paintings the
human beings and their environment have turned to stone.
The book subordinates the biography of Magritte to the task of tracing his
inner development as an artist. In one illuminating chapter Sylvester
discusses the significance of the titles of the paintings which usually have
an abstruse or oblique relation to the content, and in another he deals with
the series of paintings in which objects are labelled with words that apply
to something else. Magritte came here as an absolute godsend to Derrida and
the deconstructionists with their mistrust of language. Foucault has a
60-page essay on the famous painting by Magritte, 'The treachery of images';
the oil painting of a pipe under which is writ large - 'This is not a pipe'.
Whether or not the object depicted there is in reality a pipe, what is
beyond doubt is that Sylvester has given us a fine book about Magritte,
calmly authoritative and lucidly perceptive. His publishers have done him
deservedly proud in both lay-out of the text and the copious illustrations.

PETER PEARS: A BIOGRAPHY by Christopher Headington Faber &amp; Faber Pounds 20,
351 pages
THE BIOGRAPHIES of famous singers form, by and large, a marginal part of
music-book publishing. Few, in truth, are the tales that really needed
telling; few are the singers who in some way renewed or creatively altered
their chosen medium, who proved themselves forces for change or sources of
inspiration. And though the preservation of names, dates and places
connected with a significant vocal career will always benefit the opera or
concert historian, this only tends to confirm the minority-interest rating
of the final product.
In the ranks of shining exceptions to that rule, a first biography of Peter
Pears ought to stand proud. His 40-year relationship with a composer of
genius changed both men, crucially and with resounding consequences for the
history of 20th-century music. In a sense, Benjamin Britten invented Pears
as an artist. Without encountering the composer, as Christopher Headington's
book makes clear, the tenor might well have remained no more than a minor
concert singer, sensitive, attractive but unforceful, and technically
unfocussed in the use of his instrument; the first flush of emotional and
physical involvement between the two men marked the real onset of Pears's
startling artistic development. And though it is fruitless to speculate what
Britten's own compositional progress might have been without Pears, the
arrival of a work as explosively significant as Peter Grimes does seem hard
to imagine.
In another sense, the biography of the singer becomes a notable addition to
the growing quantity of biographical material published about the composer.
That, too, should make a Pears biography 'important': he was not only the
defining voice in all the music written for him, but an increasingly
powerful influence over all of Britten's compositional ideas and ambitions.
The relationship was, in Pears's own words, 'passionately devoted and
close', and it therefore reverberated in innumerable fascinating ways
through every one of Britten's achievements.
All the sadder, then, that Headington's Pears should prove to be, on the
whole, such a dogged disappointment. It is not without documentary value.
The material has been marshalled with sober care and punctilious concern for
detail. To excess, indeed, in the passages concerned with the minutiae of
Pears's tastes and domestic life - we learn, for instance, that 'he enjoyed
a cup of tea, and his and Britten's standard choice was Earl Grey mixed with
Darjeeling, though they did not think the Aldeburgh water was good enough to
enjoy it at its best', a not untypical example of the parish-mag tone and
style.
The facts are there, in plain abundance: Pears's ancestry (generations of
military preceded him, which lent a specific thrust to his early pacifist
convictions), the first twists and turns of his career, the early awareness
of homosexuality, the early relationships and phases of friendship with
Britten (they knew each other for a couple of years before falling in love),
the exact stages of his development into a singer of international fame, the
travels and diary entries. Headington has had access to some previously
unpublished Pears material, and uses it judiciously.
Much of all this carries its own inherent interest. What I badly miss,
though, is the genuine biographer's instinct for not only tracing patterns
but illuminating them. But perhaps one ought not to be surprised at this
central weakness. The book is, we learn from the preface, the 'official
biography' - a soubriquet that always sends a shudder of horror down this
particular reader's spine. In some ways, that instant response is unjust.
The author, a composer of some distinction who knew Britten and Pears from
his student days, published a Britten biography in 1981; his feelings of
friendship for both are honestly admitted at the outset.
Nevertheless, the 'official biography' air - and, above all, the Aldeburgh
Establishment seal of approval which the book proudly flourishes - is
apparent inthe pall of biographically limiting parti pris loyalty hanging
over it. Controversy is avoided.
There are hints of the autocratic influence over performers that Britten and
Pears increasingly exercised asthe Aldeburgh Festival took root; but these
are left largely unexplored. Cases of those regulars who after some offence
or misdemeanour suddenly became Aldeburgh non-persons - Charles Mackerras
and Robert Tear, to name just two - are generally avoided. Headington quotes
Pears on an unspecified 'two-faced Welshman', an in-group reference to Tear
that ought to have been opened out and more fully examined, with
investigative impartiality, as a way of coming to grips with the
complexities of the singer's character.
Most disappointing of all, however, is the failure to illuminate Pears's
voice, his singing, his influence for good and, indeed, bad over subsequent
generations of English tenors. After all, this was a voice that sharply
divided opinion, a voice passionately admired and no less passionately
disliked (and this through the medium of the gramophone it remains). Four
pages on Pears in John Steane's The Grand Tradition say more about that
voice - its unsteadiness, its lack of body, its unique ability to shade and
colour, its profound feeling for the inner meaning of words and notes - than
all of Headington's 351.

<TEXT>
WHAT IS FAITH? by Anthony Kenny Oxford University Press Pounds 5.99, 125
pages
IF SOMEONE says, 'I believe in God' he means one of at least three things.
He believes that God exists; or he believes that God is a reliable source of
information, as conveyed by revelation; or he trusts in God's interest and
protection and acts in response to them. Someone who believes in this third
way must also believe in the two preceding ways. Someone who believes in
God's revelation does not have to respond to it, but he must believe that
God exists. But someone who believes that God exists need neither believe
his revelation nor place trust in him. One may, of course, not be sure about
God's existence, and therefore be an agnostic; or disbelieve it outright,
and therefore be an atheist.
Faith is a narrower concept than belief. It is one of the theological
virtues, along with hope and charity. Aristotle believed that there is a
divine and self-moving Prime Mover, God. Marlowe's Faustus, teetering on the
brink of damnation, sees 'the blood of Christ streaming in the firmament';
so he still has faith, even though he has lost hope and charity.
In this book Anthony Kenny investigates whether religious faith is
reasonable. It is a problem which invites many approaches, so we find him
asking whether we can know God only through revelation, and whether we can
resolve the conflict between, on the one hand, the idea that the universe
manifests benevolent design, and on the other, the 'Problem of Evil' (how
the existence of moral and physical evils in the world can be consistent
with its creation by an allegedly good deity). These and related discussions
occupy the book's second part. In the first part Kenny tackles the central
issue: whether belief in God, in the first two ways described, makes sense.
His chief question is not, does God exist? but instead, is it rational to
believe that God exists?
Few can be better qualified to seek the answer. Kenny is a highly
distinguished philosopher who was once a Roman Catholic priest. Until lately
Master of Balliol College, Oxford, and now Warden of Rhodes House and
President of the British Academy, Kenny has written much and widely: his
books include philosophical treatises, an examination of the nuclear arms
question, lucid studies of Descartes, Aquinas and other thinkers, and an
autobiographical account of his path from the priesthood. It must be
tempting for anyone so freighted with distinctions to express himself in ex
cathedra vein, but Kenny never does so; he writes with clarity and grace.
To determine whether religious belief is rational one first has to clarify
the nature of rational belief. On the standard view, a belief is rational if
it is suitably proportioned to the evidence for it. Along with other
philosophers Kenny thinks this definition inadequate, arguing that there are
many rationally acceptable beliefs for which there is, strictly speaking, no
evidence, among them those 'basic beliefs' which underlie our world-view and
without which we could not have coherent thought. Examples include the
belief that physical objects continue to exist when we do not perceive them.
On Kenny's view a basic belief is one of three things: it is self-evident,
or it is evident to the senses or memory, or it is defensible by argument.
Belief in God's existence is neither of the first two, so if it is to count
as reasonable it has to be the third. And this means that an enquiry called
'natural theology' has to be possible. Natural theology is investigation
into questions about the existence and character of a deity which relies not
on scripture, prophecy, or some other means, but only on the careful use of
our cognitive powers.
This means that neither revelation nor mysticism will suffice to support
religious belief; such belief is rational only if good arguments can be
given for God's existence. The traditional arguments are familiar enough;
they assert that there must be a God because the universe gives the
appearance of design; something must have created it; or because the very
definition of God involves the concept of his existence. Kenny finds these
arguments unsatisfactory, and so declares himself agnostic about natural
theology - and therefore unconvinced about the reasonableness of theistic
belief.
Kenny may leave these fundamental questions tantalisingly open, but in doing
so he illuminates our understanding of what they involve, a valuable
contribution at a time when interest in them has been sharply revived by new
scientific advances.

FATHERLAND by Robert Harris Hutchinson Pounds 14.99, 372 pages
THIS WELL-crafted thriller is based on an intriguing set of
counter-factuals. What if Hitler had won the war in the east and realised
that the Allies had cracked his signals code? What if the West could only
guess at the fate of the Jews?
Robert Harris, better known as a political journalist and biographer, has
imagined the history of greater Germany, an undefeated Nazi state in which
the fevered imaginations of its founders have been given free expression.
Thus we find ourselves in 1964 Berlin as grandiosely re-built by Albert
Speer, a capital resplendent with grotesquely impressive monumental
architecture. The Fuhrer is alive and well, his Reich is in a state of
perpetual war, and his people are paranoid worshippers of a refined and
thoroughly brutal creed. Harris's grim picture is convincingly painted.
The story tells the unravelling of the Reich's secret history. When a body
is washed up on the shore of an exclusive lakeside retreat, the Kripo, or
criminal police, are called in. Enter the standard outsider of the thriller
genre. In this case, he is Xavier March, war hero, divorced, suspicious,
disillusioned and an SS officer, but above all a detective, unable to
suppress his instincts for loose ends even when he knows his career will
suffer.
March discovers that what looked like a routine accidental drowning is a
murder in which the Gestapo is implicated. A massive art fraud is uncovered
and that appears to be that. But then March connects the murdered man with a
series of other apparent accidents in which senior and retired civil
servants have died. All were involved in the mass transportation of Jews
during the war. But who is bumping them off, and why?
There are plenty of familiar twists to the plot, but Harris has done his
research and the details freshen the narrative. It is his evocation of a
totalitarian system struggling to hold itself together by protecting the
crimes and lies on which it was built that makes the book a satisfying and
slightly disturbing read.

WILLIAM FAULKNER'S LETTERS TO HIS MOTHER AND FATHER, 1918-25 Norton Pounds
16.50, 253 pages
WHAT CAN be added to the biography of William Faulkner at this point in his
posthumous career? It is 30 years since his death. The authorised biography
appeared 20 years ago, and, before and since then, there have been many
other works of exegesis - biographies more or less ephemeral, critical
assessments, monographs. We know him as one of the masters of American
modernism, amongst the trickiest and most intricate in his plays of verbal
artistry - too tricky for popular consumption, some would even argue;
positively notorious for his own homespun brand of inaccessibility.
What we know less about - and what the book under review provides - is where
all this writing came from; how he expressed himself between the ages of 12
and 27; where exactly all that raw material, the stuff of such earlier
fiction as Soldiers' Pay, and even the later masterpiece, As I Lay Dying,
was experienced as life, to be thematically enriched later on when it was
transferred to the written page. This collection of youthful letters home to
his parents helps us to understand some of that.
William Faulkner (his name was actually Falkner; he added the 'u' himself)
was born in the small, sleepy Southern town of Oxford, Mississippi, and his
first foray north happened in 1918 - he took a job, organised by a friend
who was studying at Yale, in an armaments factory in New Haven, becoming,
for the first time in his life, 'a full fledged working man' toiling
alongside 18,000 others. Why did he leave in the first place? One theory has
it that he needed to escape from the pain he felt at the marriage of his
childhood sweetheart, Estelle Oldham. As a Southerner he was a subject of
popular interest to the Yale types up there: 'These people are always saying
things to me to hear me talk,' he tells his mother in an early letter.
Everything is new to him about the people, the place. He has his first sight
of the sea. He marvels at the fact that the people speak in minutes, not
miles, when referring to distances, and where are all those movie theatres
he's so used to?
What intrigues us about these letters home is the degree of his artlessness.
There is no trace of literary ambition, no literary references, no literary
theorising, and no evidence of the kind of self-conscious stylistic
flourishes that one might have expected from a writer who was to become one
of the greatest American novelists of the 20th century. The relationship
with his mother is cosy, even babyish - he addresses her as 'momsey,'
repeatedly saying 'I love you, darling.' He sounds over-protected, even
over-indulged. In the letters to his father (an ex-railroad man), on the
other hand - he often wrote to them separately - he is bursting with
practical information about everything under the sun: the state of these
new-fangled locomotives; the tickertape machines that he glimpses for the
first time in his life.
He even asks his parents to pass on messages to each other: 'Give dad my
love and tell him that I have seen one of the largest hardware houses in
America.' Momsey sends lots of food parcels to her wide-eyed, innocent boy.
His acquaintances are amazed by the amount of correspondence he receives
from home.
And yet, as time goes on, and he moves from place to place - after New Haven
and having been stirred by the sight of British and Canadian war veterans on
the streets, he enlists in the Royal Air Force, travelling first to New York
and then on to Toronto, for a period of formal induction - he begins to
write with some burgeoning consciousness of the imaginative effect of his
writing upon others, and the phrases he starts to strike, still informally
expressed, have a distinctly Faulknerian ring to them: 'I can't realise that
big, selfish Ed Beanland is dead. It's like hearing that a lightning-rod has
been struck by lightning' is his breathless response to a piece of news from
home.
The lineaments of the man are already becoming visible in the face of the
babe.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Books: Visionary trip through English literature - Fiction /
Peter Ackroyd's latest novel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARY HOPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH MUSIC by Peter Ackroyd Hamish Hamilton Pounds 15.99, 400 pages
'SHAKESPEARE AND Dickens too hard, say teachers', reads a headline in the
Sunday Times this week. The report continues: 'teachers claim that set texts
central to the back-to-basics drive by ministers, are beyond the abilities
of too many pupils . . .' This deeply depressing item seems to emanate from
a different world from that inhabited by Peter Ackroyd, whose new novel,
steeped and saturated as it is in the English literary tradition, is both a
passionate argument for the recognition and acknowledgement of an
all-pervading Englishness of spirit and also a moving account of the
infinite delicacy and complexity of a father-son relationship.
There is a straightforward central narrative: Clement Harcombe is a
charismatic healer, who, accompanied by his son, Timothy, holds meetings for
the oppressed and depressed of the East End in the years after the First
World War. Timothy narrates, in alternative chapters, the story of his
father's 'cures' (which seem, mysteriously, to require his son's presence);
his own removal to Wiltshire to live with his mother's parents; his
schooldays; his attempts to rejoin his father, who moves further and further
into destitution until he is finally discovered in the circus from which he
originally emerged.
The growth of Timothy's consciousness, the way in which the silk of
knowledge and inheritance is spun from parental cocoon to filial spool, is
movingly achieved with an authorial voice which is more simple and intense
than anything Ackroyd has previously demonstrated in the ventriloquisms
which have become his trademark.
But sparkling ventriloquisms are also integral to Ackroyd's main purpose
here, which is an extended exegesis on the idea of Englishness, and an
implicit paean of praise, through the medium of inspired pastiche, for
English writing. Timothy's life is punctuated by visionary dreams, nourished
and triggered by the extensive reading encouraged by his father. Every other
chapter is an excursion into a visionary literary England, made up of images
which are part of the inalienable heritage of those of us lucky enough to
pre-date the benighted subjects of the Sunday Times report.
Falling asleep as his father reads to him, Timothy meets Alice and Christian
in a chapter written, if it can be imagined, by Bunyan and Lewis Carroll;
watching the film of Great Expectations, he too is grabbed by Magwitch and
enters the world of Miss Havisham, Pip and Estelle; as he searches for his
father he dreams of the detective Austin Smallwood; he dreams of Crusoe's
Island, of Williem Byrd, the father of English music, and he journeys
through London with Hogarth. In another chapter, triggered by his spell as a
picture gallery attendant, English landscape is celebrated.
We know already, from Hawksmoor, Chatterton and The Last Testament of Oscar
Wilde, that Ackroyd can throw off any impersonation he feels like: and here
he proves himself yet again to be the very Rory Bremner and John Sessions of
the current literary scene. He can dazzle effortlessly and at not
inconsiderable length.
To read Ackroyd, the playful pasticheur, is to be put through a series of
severe tests (an extensive knowledge of English literature is an advantage)
but, as all bird-watchers know, there is nothing like the pleasure of a
positive identification. More seriously, it is sometimes rather too much
like watching those games of charades which are more fun for the performers
than for the audience.
But the real problem is one of weight and balance. It is possible to feel
that Ackroy's idea of Englishness - order, harmony, good sense, 'lines of
light', line of landscape, faces and forms which occur in all generations -
is used as the passionate argument of this capacious book, not because it
makes sense in itself, but because it is what he know about and is good at.
There is an uneasy whiff of the obsessive autodidact in much of the pastiche
passages, and in the way in which everything is grist to his thematic mill:
the bones of the argument are just a little too prominent.
On the other hand, the story of Clement and Timothy is an almost
self-contained narrative of great depth and feeling: the delicacy with which
Ackroyd traces how a son only comes to know his father by degrees, how
misconceptions are gradually stripped away, how knowledge changes and
deepens love, is wholly successful.
It is in these sections of this sprawling work that the order and harmony
that Ackroyd sees as the hallmarks of Englishness truly reside. Indeed, in a
sense, the execution of this book, itself gives the lie to the author's
central thesis: there is an overwhelming, verbose cloudiness in the central
visionary passages which denies all the harmony. But, nevertheless, the book
is a splendid experience, an affirmation of the cultural spirit which has to
survive, in spite of the current difficulties with those set texts.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Peace work woven into UK history: Gerald Cadogan visits a
unique mill museum in Lancashire
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GERALD CADOGAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   THE GREAT steam engine
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
500 horsepower, almost a century old - chugs and clunks to life; its beat
steadily faster as the piston starts driving the huge flywheel.
The engine is called Peace, and it is spotless. Brass gleams. Every part
that needs oiling is oiled. Down below, in the weaving shed of the Queen
Street Mill in Burnley, 50 of the thousand looms the engine once drove are
hitched to the drive shaft, and begin to make cloth in an infernal clatter.
The mill, now Lancashire's museum of weaving, is as special as the Historic
Dockyard at Chatham in Kent, and as well worth a visit. It stopped working
commercially only in 1982. As at Chatham, 'everything is still there.'
Ersatz heritage is unnecessary. The mill is all real; it still produces
cloth. Its power comes from the last steam engine still working in
Lancashire - probably in Europe - in a mill.
Invited to see the engine start, childhood memories of steam trains crowd
back (but no driver had ever asked me on to the footplate). In the mill,
entering the engine room was such a privilege that even the boss had to have
the engineer's permission. If his clothes caught in the machinery, the
engine could run amok or explode - and put everybody out of work. The
engineer ruled by circumspection and cleanliness. (Carpet or polished wood
floor round his engine made that clear - and visitors had to take their
shoes off, the boss included.)
The Queen Street Mill stands in Harle Syke, an industrial village on a hill
on the edge of the countryside outside Burnley, once the cotton-weaving
capital of the world. The first mill was built here in about 1855. In the
1860s there were four more mills, joint stock companies and co-operatives.
The workers built their own houses; a proud, well-maintained village, then
and now.
The co-operative tradition, which began in 1844 in nearby Rochdale,
enshrined a sturdy independence; an early version of property-owning
democracy. Houses are in neat rows, their window surrounds all painted dark
blue or black. Harle Syke and Lancashire cotton were at their peak when the
Queen Street Manufacturing Company appealed to the villagers for Pounds
20,000 capital as a co-operative in 1894, offering 4000 shares at Pounds 5
each. Until it closed in 1982 it paid dividends to shareholders then
scattered across the world: to children and grandchildren, gone abroad to
seek work.
Between the world wars the mill was surprisingly successful. It had to lease
looms in the next-door mills, making large amounts of Lancashire 'grey
cloth,' and flannelette. After the second world war, foreign competition
made business hard: the narrow Lancashire looms wove cloth only up to 42
inches wide, thus ruling out, say, double sheets. And the only patterns the
mill could manage were stripes.
As a working museum the mill had a slow start. But its future is now
assured, with large capital grants from English Heritage (Pounds 600,000),
the National Heritage Memorial Fund (Pounds 200,000) and the European
Regional Development Fund (Pounds 96,000) - a recognition that this place is
unique. Lancashire County Council and Burnley Borough Council contribute to
running costs.
Retired millhands now work the machines powered by Peace, and produce cloth
to sell. You can buy old fashioned 'granddad's shirts' in warm union cloth
(68 per cent cotton, 32 per cent wool) at Pounds 29.50, and nightshirts in
fine long-staple Egyptian cotton, which the mill still imports from
Alexandria. Bread-and-butter business is making gauze for bookbindings and
plasterer's scrim, at 5p a metre. But the mill also makes shawls to send to
Jerusalem: top-quality, at Pounds 17.50 a metre. 'Something to do with
religion,' says Jack Wood, the weaving supervisor. Nobody knew if the shawls
were sold as 'Made in Lancashire.'
In its heyday the mill had been an efficient business and, as a
co-operative, free of labour troubles. There was only one fatal accident: to
a cloth salesman in 1942. The mill was rebuilt after a bad fire in 1918 -
and then, too, the engine's name was changed, from its original Prudence, to
Peace, to mark the end of 'the war to end wars.'
Pay was about Pounds 1 a week in the 1890s; by the outbreak of the first
world war, in 1914, this had risen to one pound six shillings. Working hours
were 6am to 6pm, with no shift work, and no working on Sunday. Arthur
Martin, who was engineer when the mill closed in 1982, told me his working
day was even longer: he started at 5am, 'to get up steam,' and stopped at
7.30pm. In 31 years he had had only one week's holiday.
At its peak Prudence/Peace ran 1090 looms. Now driving only 50 looms, 'it
does not have enough weight on it. It really needs 500-600 looms.' The
clatter of the weaving shed is overwhelming; deafness must have been
universal in Lancashire. The workers chatted by means of mouthing and
lip-reading ('mee-mawing,' as it was called). They were paid by the piece -
'piece work' - and fined if their cloth had a fault. All cloth was labelled
with the name of its weaver.
In the 'drawing in' or 'knotting' room, the threads are drawn in and knotted
to make the warp (the lengthwise part of the cloth). The shuttle then
crosses back and forth, carrying the (shorter) weft or woof; the result is
the woven cloth. Nowadays, mills move mobile knotting machines round the
shop floor from loom to loom.
The knotter points out: 'They have to stop the loom when knotting.' In the
old system, the new knotted warp could be quickly put on, and the loom
started again at once.
I ask about the decline of Lancashire cotton. In Harle Syke, the knotter
says, only one mill was in commercial operation; there used to be 12. 'We
were always at a disadvantage.' Yorkshire had wool on its doorstep, and
Northern Ireland had flax, but Lancashire had to import the cotton - unlike
North Carolina, which grew it on the spot.
The rain pours down - but cotton needs a damp climate to stop the threads
breaking on the looms. Visiting the mill, it is easy to see how the tough,
communal life of cotton working nurtured the co-operative movement. All
depended on one other, and the weavers all bought shares and trustingly
called the engine Prudence.
Prudence/Peace and the mill are a unique part of UK history - something to
be proud of. As she nears her centenary, the mighty machine is still going
strong. She deserves a telegram from the Queen.
The Queen Street Mill Museum is 10 minutes from Burnley centre: take a
number 50 bus from Burnley bus station. The engine runs, and cloth is woven,
on Wednesday-Friday from 10.30am-3.30pm. Tel: 0282-412555.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Bridge club bids for the big time
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JONATHAN DAVIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIXTY YEARS ago this year, in a recessionary climate just as bad as the
current one, Ely Culbertson opened a new bridge club in New York. He called
it Crockford's, after the famous London gaming club.
Culbertson was by far the most flamboyant, as well as the most commercially
minded, bridge player of his day. More than anyone else, he was responsible
for popularising a game which is now played by millions worldwide.
His dream was to start a new club where players could play high-stake rubber
bridge in surroundings as elegant as those of the gaming clubs. He hoped not
only to make some money, but to establish bridge as an accepted - even
prestigious - part of New York social life. These are qualities which the
game of bridge lacked then - and lacks still, some would argue.
Sixty years on from Culbertson's new business venture, something similar is
afoot in London. February saw the opening of a new bridge club, TGRs, in
Hyde Park Place, just off Marble Arch. Its owners share several of the same
objectives as Culbertson. Their aim, which they have backed with an
investment of Pounds 500,000, is to establish a commercially-run club where
bridge of a high standard can be played in comfortable surroundings.
For anyone accustomed to playing golf or tennis in a competitive way, this
may sound like a modest objective. But as those who have gone in search of
some bridge 'action' in London can testify, it is not easy to find the right
combination of high-calibre play and high-quality surroundings.
There are 20 or so bridge clubs dotted around the capital. All have their
own distinctive character and their own band of dedicated aficionados.
However, many are united by their somewhat shabby surroundings, smoky
basements and dingy rooms. Where food and drink are available, quality and
service are often rudimentary. And while those who belong to the clubs are
enthusiasts for the game, they are not, alas, always enthusiasts for their
fellow human beings - one of the paradoxes of a game which depends on
partnership rather than individual skill.
That is one reason why the best high-stake bridge games in London have
always tended to take place in the more sociable surroundings of Clubland
rather than in bridge clubs. The most famous bridge-playing club in town is
not a bridge club at all but a private club, the Portland, sometimes known
as the MCC of bridge. In the bridge world it is renowned for two things. By
tradition, it lays down the rules of the game, and it bans the use of any
bidding conventions. It is also rather difficult to get into.
The new club, named for its manager, Irving Ross, a well-known former
international player, therefore marks something of a breakthrough in the
development of the game in London. It may also be an early move towards the
further commercialisation of a game which, while it boasts some 2m players
in the UK, remains notably under-exploited compared with other popular
indoor pastimes, including chess.
Rose, who admits to having fallen for the lure of the green baize table at
an early age, has spent most of his life playing cards and running bridge
clubs. While a student at Glasgow University he entered tournaments under an
assumed name to avoid the displeasure of his accountant father (himself an
accomplished bridge player). For a while, he says, he led a Dostoievskian
existence as a full-time gambler. Now, at the age of 53, he has decided that
it is time to see if he cannot turn his long experience of bridge into a
successful business.
Like Culbertson before him, Rose has long harboured the idea of setting up
an upmarket bridge club on a proper commercial footing. His aim, he says, is
to combine the ambience and facilities of a good club with the best bridge
game in town. The initial membership target - already nearly met - is 400
members and may be expanded later. The capital and the premises have been
provided by two bridge-playing businessmen with property interests, Bernard
Teltscher and Howard Cohen.
Many of those who have already joined were previously members of the former
St James' Bridge Club, where Rose was the secretary. Unlike most other clubs
in London, TGRs plays rubber bridge and Chicago (an American version of
rubber bridge) only. No duplicate bridge is played. It is open seven days a
week. The annual membership fee is Pounds 150, with table money - the bridge
players' equivalent of a green fee - on top. The club occupies two floors of
a town house overlooking Hyde Park and boasts a bar, a dining room and three
card-rooms.
Among the things the new club has inherited is what Ross claims is the
highest-stake game in London. This takes place two or three nights a week
and is played for stakes of Pounds 100 a hundred - sufficient to ensure that
several thousand pounds can change hands of an evening - still less, in real
terms, Rose observes, than newspaper proprietors and others used to play for
in the uninhibited 1960s.
However, most games at TGRs are however played for more modest stakes of
between Pounds 1 and Pounds 10 a hundred. The membership covers a broad
cross-section of abilities, from international players to enthusiastic
amateurs.
A number of well-known international players take part in the Pounds 100
game. Among them, when I watched, was Zia Mahmood, a flamboyant and
brilliant Pakistani who some believe is the world's best player. In a recent
book, Mahmood describes how he learnt the game in London's bridge clubs
after tiring of his life as a qualified accountant, 'the only profession',
he declares, 'with a more boring image than bridge.'
The hope of Rose and his backers is that the presence of such charismatic
players will act as a magnet to visitors to London. 'What we are offering'
says Rose, 'is a high class and fair game played for fun. A lot of our
members love their bridge and are happy to pay to play with good players in
pleasant surroundings. What we are hoping to prove is that there is a market
for providing them with the kind of club that they want.' The shade of
Culbertson, at least, will be nodding in approval.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Two men (and four fish) on borrowed time in a boat: Why
North Sea salmon fishing may be a dying trade
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRIS TIGHE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FIVE am. Britain sleeps, on the brink of a heatwave.
In the Northumberland fishing village of Craster, skipper Eddie Grey and his
deckhand Eddie Williams lean over the harbour wall, studying the slaty North
Sea and the mist draping the ruins of medieval Dunstanburgh castle. 'Looks
hashy, mind,' says Eddie Grey.
The brisk southerly snaps at his woolly bobble hat. The southerly is a dirty
wind, he says. It chops the sea, scrambling the rolling 'lippers.'
So are they going back to their beds? No.
Eddie darts down the rungs fixed against the harbour wall and jumps, agile
in knee-high wellingtons, into his little wooden boat, the Supreme. Craft
like this - cobles, successors to the Viking longboats they resemble - have
been used for centuries, solely on England's north eastern coast.
Freshly painted in blue and white, the red canopy on the Supreme's sharp,
rising bow lends her a jaunty air. But her flat-bottomed, blunt-ended stern
is no-nonsense Northumbrian - designed so that fishermen without safe
harbours can haul their boats up the beach. (In bad tides, the Supreme is
winched up over ash logs in Craster harbour.)
A monofilament salmon net 600 yards long, 15 foot deep, topped with plastic
corks, lies folded in the coble. For the right to use this net from March 26
to August 31, between 4am and 8pm on weekdays only, starting at 6am Monday
and ending 6pm on Fridays, Eddie has to pay the National Rivers Authority
(NRA) Pounds 775 a year.
Salmon is vital to him; he supports a wife and four children. But he may be
living on borrowed time. The UK Ministry of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food
(MAFF) has been won over by lobbying, by Scottish and English riparian
owners and anglers, convinced that the north east drift net fishery is
depleting river salmon stocks.
While MAFF says it has no evidence of an 'immediate threat' to salmon stocks
from the fishery, it has 'invited' the NRA to phase out the 143 drift net
salmon licences between Holy Island and Whitby. The NRA's response is due
next month.
The Supreme's wireless, together with its longitude and latitude navigator,
are fixed under the canopy. Eddie-the-deckhand jumps into the boat; she
glides between the piers. Eddie-the-skipper gazes ahead, left hand on the
tiller at the stern.
Deckie Eddie turns up the diesel engine throttle. The Supreme rises up and
skates over the waves, dipping like a duck, surging over the tumbling ebb
tide. A wall of water looms; the little craft flies over the foam.
Eddie-the-skipper's left hand seems scarcely to move. The coble is so low in
the water that you can touch the sea - yet it barely splashes inboard.
(Later he explains how the coble, made of overlapping larch planks riveted
with copper nails, must be nudged and 'shouldered in' to each wave; steering
straight across could crack a plank.)
Two miles out, he stops; it is time to shoot the net across the tide. This
'net' is actually nine separate nets joined together by hand, in varying
colours, the better to fool the fish.
By 6am the net is played out. The Supreme glides away from it, its engine
off; the kettle goes on a camping stove for tea. The two Eddies munch
sandwiches as the 33 foot coble is buffeted about. They never feel 'shabby'
(seasick), but sometimes landlubbers have been so violently seasick that
they have had to be helped to the only place to lie down: the board over the
engine.
Breakfast over, everything is put away. 'I don't like slovenliness about a
boat,' says Eddie.
Care of the Supreme, bought new for Pounds 15,000 in 1979 (with the help of
some grant aid), is of great importance: cobles, craftsman-made by eye,
today cost more than Pounds 60,000 each. Eddie Grey, who is 42, must keep
his craft going if he is to have any chance of working all the way to his
retirement age.
The two Eddies steer the coble along the length of the net. Then they spot
it - a silver flash of salmon, caught by the gills. Skipper Eddie hooks the
net; deckie Eddie leans overboard, brandishing a circular net on a long
pole. They grab the fish, prise it out, throw it aboard; it gasps, quivers
and is still. A second salmon follows, a big one.
The net has also trapped two guillemots. Gently, the two Eddies snip them
out. Deckie Eddie, a pigeon fancier, cradles the birds, stroking them, then
lowers each one on to a wave. They squawk, and fly away.
The coble called the Supreme has no winch; 600 yards of net must be pulled
in by hand. The men haul, one each side. They move on, shoot the net again
and retreat. 'This job needs patience and perseverance,' says Eddie Grey.
'It's boring sometimes.'
More tea. Suddenly some corks disappear: it's a seal. 'You get a fish in the
net, then along comes Whiskers and eats it before you can get it on board,'
Eddie laments.
He tweaks the net. They pull in a salmon and a sea trout, haul the net and
move again.
The sun is high; the dawn chill has gone. Somebody eight miles further out
radios to say the crab fishing is dire. The Supreme, like most cobles,
fishes for crabs and lobster too; Eddie uses 240 pots, all handmade at home.
Crab prices are poor; lobster at Pounds 5 per pound, and salmon at about
Pounds 3, are better. But octopi prey on lobsters in the pots, sucking out
the flesh. And lobster and salmon stocks are declining.
The licenced north east driftnets catch comes to a total of about 40,000
salmon a year, and similar numbers of seatrout. Its critics call the nets
'curtains of death'.
'That's a lot of tommyrot,' says Eddie. Colin Warwick, a Northumberland
coble fisherman arguing the men's cause on national committees, thinks so
too. A North Sea drift net, he says, is 'like a pair of shoe laces in
Wembley stadium.'
'It's really a class battle,' says Warwick. Eddie agrees. 'They just want
the lords and ladies to catch salmon - and the people with money, who pay
thousands for a day's fishing.'
Coblemen blame salmon decline on pollution; overfishing in Greenland;
illegal netting by part-timers. Taking away their licences, they say, would
force them to put more pressure on other stocks of fish.
Back in harbour, the two Eddies carry their four fish to Robson and Sons,
the Craster kipper-curers. (The proprietor is retiring; the business is for
sale.) The three salmon together weigh 33 lb; they will go to Billingsgate.
A visitor buys the trout.
Back home, in the house he is buying on Craster's little council estate,
Eddie Grey must organise tomorrow's lobster pot bait. Even with salmon
fishing he will count himself very lucky if he earns Pounds 10,000 this year
 -after boat, licence and insurance overheads. Before the war, 30 cobles
fished out of Craster; now there is only the Supreme. Eddie-the-skipper,
last of a line of kipper curers and fishermen (he renounced his longing for
a son to take to sea after his fourth daughter was born) is desperate to
continue fishing.
'I suppose I'd be pretty useless on land; but if somebody off the land was
going to do my job, they couldn't. It would be bloody awful if I had to pack
it in. I just love the sea; I'm coble daft.'

FT  23 MAY 92 / Property: Builders who are still waiting for buyers -
Developers hope that post-election optimism and the cut in interest rates
will be translated into sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL HANSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY, THE first apartments go on show at Kensington Green, the Pounds 100m
redevelopment of St Mary Abbot's Hospital in Marloes Road, west London.
Since this 50-50 venture between Taylor Woodrow Capital Developments and
Mitsui Kensetu (UK) was launched a year ago, only five of the first 20
houses released have been sold, and another three are under offer, at prices
from Pounds 625,000 to Pounds 1.15m.
This slow rate of sales, coupled with the falling value of the five-acre
site (for which the North Thames Regional Health Authority was paid Pounds
47m), led Taylor Woodrow to write off Pounds 25m against the development in
its accounts for 1991 when it reported the first loss in its history last
month. Its Japanese partners have made similar financial provisions.
Yet it seems there is not much wrong with the development. Its architects,
Norman &amp; Dawbarn, have captured the character and quality of the best
traditional housing in Kensington, with 20th century amenities such as
adequate parking, a gated entrance with 24-hour security, and closed-circuit
TV surveillance. Nor is it particularly over-priced, with the first 33
apartments now for sale through Savills and Allsops at prices from Pounds
125,000 for a studio up to Pounds 880,000 for a three-bedroom penthouse with
spacious terraces and splendid views.
These prices equate to between Pounds 304 and Pounds 448 per square foot,
which is near the lower end of the scale for up-market new developments in
London.
Compare these prices at Kensington Green with those being sought for 3a
Palace Green, London's most expensive development, overlooking Kensington
Palace. Since this was launched a year ago, Regalian has yet to announce a
buyer for any of the 20 apartments, which range in price from Pounds 2m up
to Pounds 13.5m for the largest penthouse.
These prices equate to between Pounds 875 and an astonishing Pounds 2,000
per sq ft. Not all new developments are as expensive as these, of course,
nor are all developers having the same difficulty selling their new houses
and flats, although post-election optimism has yet to be translated into
sales, in spite of the cut in interest rates earlier this month.
Tony Kelley, managing director of CALA Homes South, says: 'Following the
election, everyone expected the property market to take off immediately, but
we thought it would take longer. In the first two weeks of May, however, we
have had our best sales this year, from first-time buyers at our Watford,
Hounslow and Pinner developments, to our family homes at Marlow, Horsham and
Poole.'
John Low, divisional managing director of Ideal Homes Holdings, says: 'We
are beginning to see a definite improvement in the housing market. We have
sold 13 starter homes on our Summerlands development in the Plymouth area in
the last four weeks.'
Other housebuilders confirm that more people are visiting their sites than
before the election, and this has led some big companies, such as Tarmac and
Wimpey, to stop discounting their prices. However, Wimpey, Countryside
Properties and Prowting Homes are still willing to do part exchanges, and
Barratt is promising to pay full market value for homes taken in part
exchange 'with no commission and no catches' - but the offer only applies to
buyers of selected new properties reserved before the end of this month and
legally completed by June 26.
Most major developers are offering three-year mortgage protection against
redundancy, and Lovell is coupling this with a guarantee that it will buy
back any of its properties in three years' time for the price paid for it.
Lovell's chief executive, Bob Sellier, explains: 'We are not prepared to sit
around and wait for the customers to come to us. Our offer applies to all
1,000 houses and flats on our 78 sites in England and Wales.'
Lovell wants to boost sales by at least 10 per cent. Last year, it sold 865
houses and flats at prices from Pounds 30,500 in Cleveland to Pounds 795,000
at Charlotte Park in Surrey, but the disposal of its Scottish housebuilding
division means that it is now unlikely to sell more than 700 homes this
year. It is only trading with the support of its banks, having made losses
of Pounds 56.4m in the year to September 30, 1991. The banks have agreed to
continue to make facilities available until the end of 1992. The market
leader, Tarmac, expects to sell 10,000 homes this year, only slightly more
than last year's 9,569, but it needs to improve profit margins.
In spite of writing down the value of its land bank of 17,000 plots by
Pounds 31m, it is still faced with an average plot value of Pounds 24,200,
which some analysts think is still far too high against an average selling
price of Pounds 77,000 for a new home.
By comparison, the Leeds-based housebuilder Tay Homes, which has increased
its land bank to 4,250 plots, or enough for more than four years at current
levels of sales, says the cost is only 15 per cent of average selling prices
of Pounds 67,000.
Wilson Connolly, one of the most profitable companies in the housebuilding
sector, sold 2,750 homes last year at an average price of Pounds 54,400 and
has built up a land bank of 14,400 plots at an average cost of Pounds
12,000. Last month, it raised Pounds 17m through a share placing to take
advantage of opportunities to buy even more land while prices are low.
Wimpey, Redrow Homes and Edmond are also among the builders who are actively
looking to buy more housing land. So too are Berkeley Homes and Charles
Church.
Octagon Developments, which has just opened its development of 14 houses in
Wimbledon Village, for sale through Hamptons at prices from Pounds 295,000
to Pounds 950,000, says that in the four weeks after the election it sold as
many houses as it would normally expect to sell in two months.
Bovis Homes is hoping that this post-election euphoria will extend to
Lydekker Park, its new development in the former grounds of Harpenden Lodge,
Hertfordshire, where new houses are available at prices from Pounds 175,000
to Pounds 365,000. There are also apartments at prices from Pounds 205,000
for a two-bedroom flat to Pounds 240,000 for a three-bedroom flat.
Five new apartments in the City of London have been opened, forming part of
a new square created off London Wall behind MEPC's flagship office
development, Alban Gate. The five apartments are for sale through Debenham
Tewson &amp; Chinnocks at prices from Pounds 165,000 for a one-bedroom
pied-a-terre to Pounds 275,000 for a two-bedroom penthouse.
Growing confidence in residential property is encouraging developers to
consider starting new schemes. One of the most ambitious in London is that
by Northacre Investments to develop the site of 14 derelict houses in
Observatory Gardens and Campden Hill Road, Kensington.
The site was sold last year by the Mountleigh Group with planning permission
for 70 flats, but Northacre made a revised application at the beginning of
May for up to 60 flats and an underground car park to be built behind the
restored facades of the houses in Observatory Gardens, and for the two
houses in Campden Hill Road to be refurbished as ten flats. The scheme has
been designed by Swedish architect Klas Nilsson and is funded by Dutch
investors.
The Grosvenor Estate is looking for a developer to buy a block of property
in Park Street and Rex Place, Mayfair, for refurbishment as 14 houses and
flats with garaging for 14 cars. The property has just been placed on the
market by Savills and Wetherell, who are seeking offers of Pounds 3.5m.
Finally, a mixed development known as Thomas Neal's in Covent Garden has
just been completed by Kleinwort Benson Property Fund and Langbourn Property
Investment Services. As well as offices and shops, this has 13 flats and a
house for sale through E A Shaw &amp; Partners at Pounds 100,000 to Pounds
335,000.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Gardening: Pick of the show, hostas with the mostest - Robin
Lane Fox plans a leafy treat for himself after an exhausting time at Chelsea
flower show
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL THIS Monday, I have always thought that in gardening circles, H T
stands for a Hybrid Tea rose. Near the exit to Chelsea flower show, I learnt
this week that it stands for something else: Horticultural Therapy, for
those who want to garden but are disabled.
By the Chelsea exit, all legs ache and the mind becomes hazy. The H T stand
was strategically placed and a positive woman in navy blue explained with
enthusiasm: No, H T could not help just now if my feet were about to fall
off, but she could help if the worst came to the worst and I went blind, for
example.
Perhaps the colour-planners of most of the outdoor gardens at Chelsea have
been needing H T all these years. They are still capable of some
extraordinarily awful colour schemes which are not much of an advertisement
for the great English garden: Wyevale gardens surprised all sensitive eyes
this year with its attempted echo of Scotland.
I thought the best was the Daily Mirror's design because it combined odd
angles and not too many plants, all of a civilised colour. For once, I could
imagine inhabiting a Chelsea exhibit for more than half an hour.
This year, many exhibitors favoured the long-eared Lavender Stoechas,
especially the pedunculata form, and the Mirror had majored on it, perhaps
implying that it would be hardy in most of the British Isles. Do not be
tempted, because it is not.
The Daily Telegraph tried a different image of temptation, a Vision of
Paradise with overtones sometimes said to be Persian, sometimes Islamic or
sometimes simply Eastern.
Much of the planting was pretty, although the Turkish sort of tent at the
back was a bit rich: Moslems might be surprised to find this rather eclectic
design claiming an historic semi-Islamic origin.
Further down the bank, the heroic exhibitor of the first garden ever to be
shown from Uzbekistan might have once known better what made a truly Eastern
paradise. Years of political slavery and the backwash of modernism had
reduced it to some hard and bright surfaces and beastly dots of red salvia.
Horticulturally, the main therapy is always found inside the main tent. Each
year, the smaller herbaceous nurseries consolidate their advance at the
expense of many of the older and bigger enterprises.
The grandeur of the 1950s has gradually faded. Most of the specialists in
these smaller concerns have brought a greater sensitivity to colour and
arrangement.
Glebe Cottage, Foxgrove, Four Seasons and Rushfields are some of the names
which show herbaceous plants with particular elegance. This year, Four
Seasons from Norfolk had hit the mark superbly with a harmony of white, pale
yellow and shades of pink.
Meanwhile, Blooms of Bressingham, Norfolk, is there as a reminder that big
can also be beautiful. Yet another fine exhibit from this large company
encouraged me to follow up Hucherella Charles Bloom because its darkish
leaves are not too sombre and its haze of peach-pink flowers looked
exquisite. It will also grow in shade.
At a lower height, the second Chelsea exhibit of the Hileys from south
London was full of temptations and half-hardy rarities. We swopped notes on
the winter deaths among penstemons, agreeing that the white had been hardest
hit; we admired the aromatic leaves of their Salvia discolor and its black
flowers; I was drawn to one of the old forms of mauve Cherry Pie which has
to be bought as plants from cuttings because they smell so much more sweetly
than any which grow nowadays from seed.
Gardens could hardly have been hotter or more dry this week. Perhaps as a
result, I was particularly drawn to a cool display of shade-loving plants
from Paradise Centre, Lamarsh, Bures, Suffolk.
The nursery is new to me, but one of its groupings seemed more like paradise
than those from the Tory press. We do not often see superb Haberleas in a
full display of pale lilac flower among Shooting Stars, or Dodecatheon, with
tall stems, evidently grown outdoors.
Indeed, the proprietress assured me that she had dug up some of the star
turns from her own garden a day or two before.
The accompanying publicity refers to 'harmonious birdsong, the gentle
scurrying of squirrels and nearby paddocks with unusual African pygmy
goats.' Nonetheless, these rare woodland plants seem to like it.
My personal high spots were threefold. One was the very knowing show-person
on an expert stand of alpine plants who pointed out the saxifrages growing
happily in bits of tufa rock.
High spot number two was the marvellous stand from Notcutts, once again the
best of the big exhibitors of trees, shrubs and climbers.
It arranges its lilacs so prettily and, in my mind's eye, I still see the
arch of climbing plants on which Notcutts designers excel themselves. This
year, it was clothed in wisteria, Yellow Rose Emily Gray and a wonderfully
variegated honeysuckle called Harlequin which I will rush out and buy.
Flowers, however, are not everything. For plain quality, my final high spot
was the stand from Goldbrook, at Hoxne, Eye, Suffolk. Since 1988, its hostas
have won gold medals and the owner, Sandra Bond, has emerged as the nursery
trade's queen of this family. Hostas and their huge leaves are wonderful
plants for exhibition when they revive and glisten at the touch of a hose.
So many new varieties have been bred in Britain, America and Japan that we
all need time to digest them and see them at maturity. Sandra Bond's display
refutes the critics who wonder if new means better. The best are not cheap,
but I could not resist the enormous leaves of one called Sum and Substance,
which is not over-priced at Pounds 9.
Somehow, my feet seemed to have survived Chelsea's crowds after all and my
vision is no more peculiar than usual: for me, this year, H T will stand not
for horticultural therapy but for an extravagant Hosta Treat.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Gardening: Historic views on a Cornish headland - A Garden
to Visit / One of Britain's finest landscape parks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AT THE extreme south-east corner of Cornwall, where the rugged coast turns
northwards into Plymouth Sound, there is a bluff headland which is nearly
filled by one of the finest landscape parks in Britain: Mount Edgcumbe, home
for centuries to the Edgcumbe family.
When Richard Edgcumbe built his turreted mansion there in 1547, he sited it
halfway up the northern end of the headland, exposed fully to the sea and
the sound, with a direct view of Plymouth across the water and Dartmoor in
the far background. To highlight this outlook, he planted a double avenue of
trees, with a wide grass ride between them, centred on the house.
There are other equally impressive views, particularly south-east and south
towards the Channel, and later generations were to take full advantage of
them. For the moment, however, the Edgcumbes contended themselves with their
800 acres which they used as a hunting park. Over the years, this began to
develop an increasingly composed quality, with many fine belts and coppices
of trees, plus occasional isolated stone pines to add an element of drama.
The only really level ground is by the sea, just to the south-east of the
double avenue. It was there, fairly early in the 18th century, that a
wilderness of trees and shrubs was planted. At that time, this was a very
fashionable idea for getting away from the formality of much garden-making.
The Edgcumbes showed a lively appreciation of what was going on by doing all
planning and planting themselves, right up to 1971 when the property was
sold to Plymouth City Council and Cornwall County Council.
In all that long period, the family sought the advice of only one
nationally-known gardener: William Mason, who provided help in turning a
wilderness into what is known now as the English garden. But thereby hangs a
story which was to affect the garden, and the fortunes of the Edgcumbes,
profoundly.
In 1779, there was a threat of invasion by the French and Spanish fleets,
and the War Office demanded that all Mount Edgcumbe's trees and shrubs near
the water be felled lest the enemy use them as cover. The order, which
included the complete destruction of the wilderness, was obeyed. A couple of
years later, the Edgcumbe who then owned the property was made a viscount -
an honour which soon became an earldom.
The following years saw a great burst of activity at Mount Edgcumbe, and
this took two forms. The landscape was improved further by the addition of a
circulating road known as the Earl's Drive, which incorporated various
architectural features, some already in place and others newly constructed.
In addition, a great natural amphitheatre facing Plymouth Sound was planted
with trees and shrubs which, as the years went by, became more and more
exotic. Eventually, this area became a very fine example of a 19th century
woodland garden, complete with rhododendrons, camellias, magnolias and other
fashionable species.
A quite separate development, concealed from the amphitheatre by trees and
hedges, included Mason's English garden and, at a later date, two other
specialised gardens, one Italian in style and the other French. These
allowed other architectural features to be used: an orangery and a
balustraded stairway with statues in the Italian garden; and a conservatory
in the French garden, where there is also a shell fountain, a trellis
arcade, and much colourful bedding-out with plants in season.
Since Mount Edgcumbe was sold, two more specialised gardens have been made.
One is devoted largely to American plants, both to commemorate the US
soldiers who were stationed there during the Second World War and to
acknowledge family connections with America; the other a New Zealand garden
with NZ plants and a spectacular geyser which spouts every 20 seconds or so.
Much of the mansion was destroyed by fire bombs during the war, although it
was rebuilt afterwards in much the same style. But another new garden, known
as the Earl's garden, has been made behind this building, in Victorian
style, with trees, shrubs, flower beds and well-kept lawns. Here, at the
back of one of the lawns against a steep primrose bank, the wild British
orchid known as lady's tresses has established itself and flowers freely. It
is preserved by adjusting the mowing regime to suit the orchid's period of
growth - proof that excellent conservation is not incompatible with
highly-disciplined gardening.
As if to acknowledge how firmly this historic garden has been linked with
our own times, it now contains the national collection of camellias, most of
themplanted in the amphitheatre, where conditions are ideal. There are
already 450 varieties and, no doubt, many more to come.
Park and gardens are open daily all year, free of charge. The house and the
Earl's garden are open April 1-October 11, Wednesdays to Sundays and bank
holidays, 11am-5.30pm, for an admission fee.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Sport: Luxury courses find themselves in the rough - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DO YOU remember when you could drive a VW Golf GTI without paying a
four-figure sum in insurance and you were considered improperly dressed
unless you carried a mobile phone? In those days, the late 1980s, it seemed
that lavish golf course projects were being announced or opened every week.
In England, Wisley, next to the Royal Horticultural Society's gardens, and
Mill Ride, near Ascot, were just two, both set inside the golden circle of
the M25 London orbital motorway. Each thought it was the acme of 21st
century golf clubs.
Another was East Sussex, near Gatwick airport. Nothing was too fanciful for
the Pounds 32.5m project. It was modelled on the Augusta National golf
course in Georgia, site of the US Masters. A special type of bent grass,
common in the US but little-known in Britain, was sown on the two courses
and more than 40 greenkeepers were employed to tend it.
The announcement about East Sussex was made by Brian Turner, a Canadian
entrepreneur, who was the driving force behind the lavish project that was
going to have a 200-bedroom hotel, a 35,000 sq ft clubhouse and a pro's shop
selling the best clothes and offering a hemming and tailoring service.
Soon, East Sussex was competing for attention with a Pounds 52m venture
comprising two championship courses and a luxury hotel to be built on the
shores of Loch Lomond. The courses were to be designed by Tom Weiskopf and
named the High Road and the Low Road. The clubhouse was to be the
200-year-old former family home of the Colquhoun family.
There were at least two similarities between Loch Lomond and East Sussex.
Both bid for the 1993 Ryder Cup on the principle that 'if you don't ask, you
don't get'; and both were created by ambitious golf enthusiasts.
Not to be left out, north-east England joined in with Slaley Hall, a Pounds
20m golf and country club 20 miles from Newcastle, in Northumberland.
In those days, money - and dreams - were plentiful. Wherever you looked,
golf courses were being planned or built. By the end of 1990, more than
1,000 applications to build courses had been made to local authorities in
England alone.
International Resort Holdings developed Collingtree Park in Northampton. In
Essex, near Maldon, plans for a Pounds 20m leisure complex were laid.
Quietwaters was to have the largest luxury hotel and leisure complex in
Europe. The PGA European Tour were shareholders in the project and the
renowned golfteacher, David Leadbetter, chose it as his UK teaching base.
Then Britain's economy began to falter. At clubs like Wisley and Mill Ride,
the supply of prospective members, who were being asked to buy debentures,
dried up. 'The Japanese stock market has gone to hell and there are very few
people of high net worth around these days,' says one developer with a sigh.
Wisley and Mill Ride survived but one that did not was Loch Lomond.
Receivers were called in late in 1990 and though one course has been
completed and is open, no buyers are in sight. Weiskopf is cooling his heels
in Arizona, anxious to get on with the second 18 holes. He has said that if
he is unable to conclude his work at Loch Lomond it would be the biggest
disappointment of his career.
Then the bad news started to arrive from all quarters. Slaley Hall,
described in its brochure as 'The Ultimate Dream,' went into receivership
last summer with debts of more than Pounds 20m. Two months ago Broome Park,
a club near Canterbury, Kent, went under and was quickly followed by
Quietwaters. Last month shares in International Resort Holdings were
suspended and the receivers were appointed eight days ago.
East Sussex looked as though it might suffer a similar fate. Instead,
Turner's extravagant dream has been given a new lease of life by new owners.
Work on a Pounds 5m clubhouse began last month and will be completed by the
end of May 1993. There are no longer 40 greenkeeping staff. A new chief
executive has been appointed, the Hon John Sinclair, formerly operations
director of the company operating Cliveden, the stately home hotel.
'Others may have failed but we have not,' says Ian Jones, chairman of
Granfel and Thornbrook Properties, the companies that own East Sussex. 'We
are continuing to invest and develop and in the Kuwaiti Investment Office we
have one of the strongest financial backers in the City behind us.'
I asked Jones why he thought so many projets had failed. 'Some were too
ambitious and clearly over-extended themselves,' he said. 'Then came the
report by the Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews calling for 700 new
courses to be built by the end of the century. That got people going. Then
there was some extra money around. I think people don't realise that golf
itself doesn't bring in much money. What it does is bring associated capital
developments on stream.'
East Sussex's brighter future was emphasised on May 21 when it was announced
it will host next year's European Open. The membership target has been
revised to 500. 'We won't reach it in the immediate future,' said Jones.
'Last summer we gave money back to anyone who wanted to leave the club.
There were about 10 per cent redemptions. But this was marked by a new
take-up of debentures and annual membership.
'I don't know how long it will take for the price of golf in the UK to
equate with other countries. At the moment some golfers pay more for one
day's pheasant shooting than they do for one year's golf subscription.'
On the other hand, he reckons that there seems to be demand for an 'extra
special sort of club.'
'Still?' I asked?
'Yes, still,' he said. 'East Sussex is situated in the heart of the Sussex
is the only major course in such a setting. It has natural rather than
artificial features. It is being kept in good condition. Our golf revenue is
up 50 per cent this year on last.'
Perhaps mobile phones will make a comeback.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Motoring: Diesels for sensible ecologists
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A HARDY annual among letters from readers goes something like this: 'I am
retiring soon and have to face life without a company car. As a private
motorist paying his own bills, I want to take advantage of a diesel car's
economy and reliability - but I hate the thought of going back to manual
transmission after years of driving automatics. Are there any two-pedal
diesels I could afford?
My answer is always yes - but with reservations.
There can be no argument that diesel cars save ever-more-expensive fuel and
are friendly to the environment. And that automatic transmission is far
better than a manual gearbox if most of your driving is in town or heavy
traffic. So, in many ways a two-pedal diesel is the ideal car for the 1990s.
The trouble is there are not many of them about.
Diesel cars are taking close to 12 per cent of the UK market and there are
nearly 150 saloons, hatchbacks and estate cars from which to choose. But
fewer than 20 of them are available as automatics.
Mercedes-Benz has always set a good example. Ten years ago, when only one
British buyer in 100 chose a diesel car, every one sold by Mercedes was
offered with an automatic transmission option. They still are. On the 190D
and 250D models, it costs just over Pounds 1,000 extra, but the 300D saloon
and 300TD estate have it as standard.
It is a pity so few two-pedal models are available because automatic
transmission is an ideal partner for a diesel engine of adequate capacity
and performance. Development over the years has made diesels with manual
gearboxes as easy to drive smoothly as petrol-engined cars. Virtually gone
are the rather wooden response to pressure on the accelerator, and the need
for care to avoid jerkiness during low-speed traffic driving. gone. But
interposing the hydraulic torque converter of an automatic transmission
between engine and drive wheels completes the cure.
So why are car-makers reluctant to offer two-pedal diesels? There are two
reasons: price, and reduced performance.
Normally, but not always, a diesel car has a higher list price than its
petrol-engined equivalent. Automatic transmissions cost more to make than
manual gearboxes. Barring Mercedes, most diesel car manufacturers seem to
feel that a combination of the two would price their vehicles out of the
market.
Fortunately for those who cannot afford a Mercedes, Citroen also thinks
otherwise. Buyers of its ZX Avantage and Aura can have the PSA Group's
renowned 1.9-litre XU diesel engine, combined with automatic transmission,
at strictly affordable prices.
The Avantage costs Pounds 11,072 against Pounds 11,909 for the power-steered
and better-equipped Aura. Both have remote-controlled central locking,
electric front windows and sun roof, and a stereo that should put off
thieves because the only car it will fit is another ZX.
I found the Aura diesel most likeable. The four-speed automatic changes up
ultra-smoothly when accelerating. On slowing down for 30-35 mph (48-56 kmh)
bends, the transmission's shift into third for a quick pick-up is only just
detectable.
Automatics do absorb some power. The two-pedal ZX diesel is not quite as
quick off the mark as its manual version. Its top speed is said to be
slightly lower and the fuel consumption perhaps 5-7 per cent higher,
although much depends on how you drive it.
For many motorists, though, the gains in convenience and driving relaxation
are well worth it. They certainly would be for me. As a two-pedal ZX diesel
will give a sensible driver 45 mpg (6.27 l/100km) in average use, it must be
rated economical as well as agreeable personal transport.
The Citroen BX19TGD, one size up, also is offered with the same engine and
transmission as the two-pedal diesel ZX at Pounds 12,563. The biggest
Citroen diesel, the XM td is a lovely car with a five-speed gearbox and can
be incredibly economical; mine gave me 44-45 mpg (6.42-6.27 1/100 km)
regularly on a journey. But the automatic version (from Pounds 18,810) is
better. Although a little thirstier, it is more refined at low speeds.
Having only two pedals makes the foot-operated parking brake acceptable. Not
being blessed with three feet, I never got used to its awkwardness in the XM
manual.
Peugeot's 605 has the same punchy, 2.1-litre, 12-valve turbo-diesel as the
XM and this, too, is twice the car with automatic transmission. It costs
from Pounds 20,259.
The Mercedes-Benz 190D 2.5 I am driving now is, for me, almost the perfect
car. It is exactly the right size, has an enormous boot, is air-conditioned
and built like a bank vault. No other diesels can match the urbanity of a
Mercedes. The 190D 2.5's five-cylinder engine, cocooned in sound-damping
material, fires up first thing with no more than a chuckle and is barely
audible at tick-over.
Having no turbo-charger, its acceleration is hardly kick-in-the-back, but it
cruises on the Autobahn at 100 mph (161 kph) with no more fuss than it does
at 70 mph (113 kmh) or thereabouts on a British motorway. Consumption is
around 32-38 mpg (8.82-7.43 l/100 km).
The main snag with a Mercedes diesel is high initial cost. An automatic 190D
2.5 is listed at Pounds 21,393 but, on the road with air-conditioning and a
few other goodies, it is nearer Pounds 25,000. The pleasant, if leisurely,
two-litre 190D automatic is Pounds 18,343, although the price is more likely
to be more than Pounds 19,000 key-in-hand.
Volvo's 940 turbo-diesel automatic - apart from the Mercedes 300D, the only
six-cylinder diesel car sold in Britain - costs Pounds 21,050. It is a
quiet, smooth drive.
If you have the money, the best diesel car of all is the Mercedes-Benz 300D
with standard automatic transmission. It is listed at Pounds 25,270 although
the bottom line will be more like Pounds 29,000 with air-conditioning and a
few extras, But when you sell it some years and 100,000 miles later, still
running like new, it will have lost a smaller proportion of its original
value than almost any other car.
A diesel Rover Metro (this column, last week) with CVT, a simple but most
effective form of automatic transmission, is a thought to conjure with. It
could be a lovely little car but the price would probably deter most
potential buyers. Further up-market, BMW will at last be bringing its
excellent six-cylinder turbo-diesels to Britain by the end of this year.
I have been saying it for years and now a lot of people seem to be agreeing
with me. Diesels really are the cars for sensible drivers who want to pay
more than lip service to protecting the environment.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Sport: Costa threatens to blight Courier's springtime in
Paris - Tennis  / The French Open draw offers some enthralling contests
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BARRETT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE next two weeks, Paris will be the focus of attention for tennis fans
everywhere. The defending champions, Jim Courier and Monica Seles, both
competing on the slow red clay at the Stade Roland Garros for the fourth
time, will be strongly fancied to retain their French Open crowns, even
though each was dealt a difficult hand at yesterday's draw.
The fact that Seles - also the champion in 1990 - lost in her last final in
Rome two weeks ago to Gabriela Sabatini is not important. The 18-year-old
Yugoslav had come back from an injury and saw the Italian Open as
preparation for the sterner tests ahead in Paris.
Courier, by contrast, won emphatically in Rome last week and saw it as a
good augury for the two testing weeks that lie ahead. He has had a quiet
week of practice and preparation with his travelling coach, Brad Stine, and
should be feeling relaxed and confident.
Certainly you cannot bet against this rugged, smiling American because there
is no finer match player on any surface at the moment. But fate was
certainly not smiling on Courier at the draw. In the champion's immediate
path lie Thomas Muster of Austria and Alberto Mancini of Argentina,
clay-court experts both.
Ahead will come stern tests either against Carlos Costa, Courier's victim in
the Italian Open final, or Goran Ivanisevic, the strong-serving Croatian
left-hander. Beyond lie Courier's pal Pete Sampras, Guy Forget, or last
year's finalist, Andre Agassi. It could hardly be more difficult for
Courier.
Here are the seeds in the top half, in draw order: Courier (No 1) v Jakob
Hlasek (16); Costa (9) v Ivanisevic (8); Sampras (3) v Alexander Volkov
(14); Agassi (11) v Forget (6). In the lower half the seeds seem less
threatened, though there are two intriguing first round clashes.
The Wimbledon champion, Michael Stich, faces 39-year-old Jimmy Connors who
last year earned a tremendous ovation when levelling at two sets all against
the 1989 champion, Michael Chang, before retiring exhausted. I fancy Connors
will want to go out in a blaze of glory again this time.
Ivan Lendl must play the fine young Spaniard, Sergi Bruguera, who last year
beat Boris Becker to win the Monte Carlo tournament but has not been as
effective this year. But then, nor has the ageing Lendl. Becker,
incidentally, is absent with a leg injury.
This is how the seeded players will meet in the bottom half if they all
reach their appointed places: Chang (5) v Richard Krajicek (12); Aaron
Krickstein (13) v Stich (4); Petr Korda (7) v Lendl (10); Brad Gilbert (15)
v Stefan Edberg (2).
If there are is to be a surprise winner among the men, Costa could be the
one. The 24-year-old right hander from Barcelona looked most impressive when
I watched him in Rome, and was clearly enjoying himself as he beat
Krickstein, Ferreira, Santoro, Yzaga and Korda before running out of steam
against Courier.
There is an admirable variety about his game not usually found in Europeans
bred on clay. They tend to be one-dimensional baseliners. Not Costa. He was
as happy following his serves to the net to deliver a sharp winning volley
as he was scurrying across the baseline mixing bullet-like backhand passes
with shrewd lobs.
He has great touch and imagination, too, which carried the mind back to
those other great Spaniards, Manuel Santana and Manolo Orantes. It was all
most entertaining - and done with a winning smile that had the excitable
Roman girls swooning in the sunshine.
It has been a wonderful year for this former Spanish junior champion. In
Estoril, Costa won his first Tour title with back-to-back wins over his
country's No's 1 and 2, Emilio Sanchez and Bruguera. That was a particularly
satisfying moment for one who has been consistently overshadowed at home by
less talented but more successful men.
This time last year, for instance, Bruguera was ranked at No 5 in the world
after that victory over Becker in Monte Carlo. To underline his improvement,
Costa promptly went on to Barcelona the following week and won the Spanish
championships. In the final, Costa beat Mancini, another man in good form
who had won the important tournament in Key Biscayne in March.
Then, after proceeding to the final in Madrid, Carlos beat Agassi on the way
to the semi-finals in Hamburg, another feather in an already well-decorated
bonnet. All this success has lifted Costa's world ranking to No 10 and his
season's earnings to almost Dollars 500,000 (Pounds 282,500). The only
question mark about his likely success in Paris is the effect this new-found
fame and fortune will have on him.
If he really believes himself worthy to stand alongside the likes of
Courier, Chang and Edberg, then Costa could do some serious damage these
next two weeks, though he is desperately unlucky to be so close in the draw
to Courier. Come to think of it, Courier is probably cursing his own bad
luck.
I shall be surprised if there are many surprises in the women's event. So
quickly does the form fall away after the top dozen that upsets usually
occur only as the result of injury or illness. Nevertheless, Seles will
hardly be overjoyed to find Jennifer Capriati and Gabriela Sabatini, the
only two women to have beaten her this year, both in her half.
First, though, she must beat the amazing young German, Anke Huber, 17, who
gave her two really testing matches in Australia. The seeding in the top
half has worked out like this: Seles (1) v Huber (9); Mary Pierce (13) v
Capriati (5); Sabatini (3) v Katerina Maleeva (11); Leila Meskhi (15) v
Conchita Martinez (7).
In the lower half the former champion, Steffi Graf, will have noted that
Arantxa Sanchez-Vicario, who thrashed her (there is no other word) 6-0 6-2
in last year's semi-finals, is cast to meet her there again this time: a
tantalising prospect for the fans, but not for Graf who, though successful
in Hamburg and Berlin, has shown most erratic form of late.
The draw has suggested the following line-up in the bottom half: Manuela
Maleeva-Fragniere (8) v Nathalie Tauziat (12); Kamiko Date (14) v
Sanchez-Vicario (4); Mary Joe Fernandez (6) v Sabine Appelmans (16); Jana
Novotna (10) v Graf (2).
As usual, this great championship will provide a feast of entertainment; I,
for one, cannot wait to get my feet under the dining table.

Because of a slip, last week's article on the Royal Viking Queen cruise-ship
stated that 'the average daily price paid by US clients for a two-week
cruise on the Queen is Dollars 9,500 per person.' As the article later made
clear, the Dollars 9,500 relates to 14 days' cruising - an average daily
price (per person) of Dollars 679.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Travel: Menorca: simple fare, astral experiences - The
influences which have shaped the most easterly of the Balearics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GILBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MAJORCA . . . Menorca . . . these Balearic islands always sound to me like a
pair of chirpy Spanish public schoolboys. The difference between them is
much more than 100 miles of Mediterranean.
Menorca is the quiet and modest one. If you felt energetic you could cycle
across it in a day along its central spine of a road. Menorca is remarkably
sane about tourism. For a start, its season lasts only from the end of April
to the end of October. I caught the final charter flight out of Mahon last
October, having been the last guest to check out of the Hotel Gala Galdana
which faces the superb horseshoe bay of Gala Galdana in the south.
Shutters were going up all over the island. No wonder that it only has 10
per cent of the visitors who stay in Majorca. There are also tight and
strictly-observed controls on hotel development and only eight petrol
stations on the whole island.
At the oddly-named Bar Alaska near the hotel, Antonio told me over a
farewell San Miguel that he was about to go back to his family on the
mainland in Andalucia. 'Six months you earn: six months you spend. But even
in the season it's quiet here. If you want discos and late nights go to
Ibiza or Majorca.'
I wanted neither of those, and I have been to Majorca enough times to know
that you can escape noise by choosing carefully even there. But Menorca's
legendary tranquility is a deceptive facade. Yes, English visitors do a
double-take when they see huge Friesian cows lolling in green fields, and
you can spot blackberry bushes in country lanes or sash windows in Mahon's
18th-century Georgian houses.
But the legacy of British occupation in the 18th century is matched by the
impact of the other invaders of this most easterly of the Balearic islands.
Phoenicians, Carthaginians, Romans, Arabs, Moors, Catalans and French - all
occupied the island.
The most interesting of the settlers were the oldest and most enigmatic  -
the prehistoric inhabitants who, 3,000 years ago, built the hundreds of
stone monuments that make Menorca a unique open-air museum. Imagine 100
miniature Stonehenges scattered across the Isle of Wight, lying in farmers'
fields, and you have some idea of the impact of Menorca's monuments.
I used the excellent Landscapes of Menorca by Rodney Ansell to find my way
to a dozen different sites where you can stroll around three types of
prehistoric monument. There are talayots, conical mounds of stone which were
originally watch-towers; navetas, burial chambers which look like upturned
stone boats, and taulas, mysterious pairs of massive rectangular stone slabs
carefully slotted and balanced together to give the appearance of a capital
T.
The best way to explore Menorca is to drive or, where possible, walk to a
selection of these sites which are accessible in superb countryside. Green
hills, artful dry-stone walls which separate every field like punctuation,
sharp ravines and rocky headlands form a dramatic backdrop to many of these
sites.
The best example of a naveta is at Es Tudons, 4 km outside Cuidadela. This
two-storey burial chamber has been well restored and is reckoned to be the
oldest roofed building in Spain, if not in western Europe. I walked along
paths of dry red earth studded with tiny wild autumn crocuses to reach the
naveta.
Not far from Es Tudons I found my first taula at a settlement called Torre
Llafuda. To navigate accurately to these sites, I recommend a second slim
book called Taulas and Talayots by Michael Hoskin and William Waldren, two
English academics. At Torre Llafuda, the taula precinct is set in an olive
grove and the book led me accurately over cattle grids, iron gates and past
a farmhouse to find the enigmatic T-shaped slabs of stone still standing in
their original grooves after 3,000 years.
The largest of these sites are in central Menorca. Torre d'en Gaumes and
Torralba d'en Salort are easy to find off the main Mahon-Cuidadela road near
the town of Alayor. Both settlements have been thoroughly excavated and you
can wander among taulas, talayots and the ingenious water irrigation sytems
that, with their hollows and contours, remind one of rough-hewn,
weather-beaten Giacometti sculptures.
My ideal day included taking one of the walks suggested in Landscapes of
Menorca, a visit to some prehistoric sites, lunch in a simple Menorcan
restaurant and relaxation in one of the island's 120 bays and coves.
Ferreries, the nearest town to Gala Galdana, has a modest restaurant
lumbered with the unfortunate name of Vimpi. It soon became our local
because of its outstanding tapas and fish dishes, although I decided to
decline Vimpi's speciality, 'Rabbit of the House'. Squid in garlic, octopus,
breaded mussels and stuffed aubergines were quite good enough.
And we could always climb the nearby hill of Santa Agueda. It is only 870
ft, but you climb up a path that used to be one of the oldest roads on the
island. The Romans had a fortress on the summit and much of the original
Roman paving is still there, set in the ochre earth. The 40-minute climb
takes you past pine trees, wild pomegranates, rosemary and fennel, crickets
and darting lizards, until you reach the remains of the Roman fort and a
Moorish castle, surrounded by fig trees and an outstanding view of western
Menorca.
Based at Gala Galdana, it is easy to walk to many other nearby horseshoe
bays or creeks which are often deserted, like Gala Mitjana and Macarella.
On the way to the airport at Mahon, I couldn't resist a final stop at the
newly-excavated settlement of Sonacasana. It was a lucky diversion because I
met two German researchers who were plotting the alignments of every taula
on the island.
Laying their complex charts on the yellow limestone, they showed me the
evidence to support the theory proposed by Michael Hoskin of Churchill
College, Cambridge, that the taulas are most probably sacred monuments
linked to ancient worship of the stars.
Every mysterious giant stone T on the island has a clear view of the horizon
and points directly towards specific bright stars, mainly the Southern Cross
and Alpha Centauri. The taulas are all oriented towards these stars'
trajectories across the southern Menorcan sky of 3,000 years ago. Evidence
for animal sacrifice and the discovery of religious artefacts at the taulas
(including a statue of the Egyptian god of medicine, Imhotep), support the
theory that the early Menorcan religion, like Egypt's, was astral.
Thomson Holidays has flights only to Menorca from Pounds 132 return, and
half-board holidays at Hotel Cala Galdana from Pounds 256 for seven days.
Both its Small and Friendly and Summer Sun brochures have a selection of
other packages to different resorts in Menorca.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Travel: Dodging the herd on Limnos
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST September I enjoyed a pleasant week's holiday at the Akti Myrina hotel
on Limnos, a low-lying island in the north-eastern Aegean. The visit was
organised by The Best of Greece, a small upmarket tour operator that claims
that 'long ago, we learned one essential thing about running a travel
business to and in Greece: we don't cut corners and we don't look after the
herd, the masses.'
Its current brochure even quotes Noel Coward: 'Why do all the wrong people
travel, travel, travel and all the right people stay at home.'
Fair enough. The brochure was written well before John Major's win in last
month's UK election, though perhaps next year's brochure will adopt a less
class-conscious tone.
But possibly it won't, for it cannot be doubted that The Best of Greece
attracts well-heeled customers who want hassle-free holidays in the sort of
hotels featured in its brochure.
The new driving force at The Best of Greece is David Barber, who took over
as general manager in March last year. Since then he has travelled
extensively through the islands, seeking out 'hidden gems' like the Villa
Andromeda, a former ambassadorial residence in Chania, Crete; the Tsitouras
Collection, five houses converted from a 19th century mansion on Santorini;
the Villa Daphne on Paros, and the private island (two houses) of
Argironisos, off the Pilion peninsular.
Also new this year is the Candia Park Village near Aghios Nikolaos, Crete,
due to open next month, and a new choice of sailing holidays.
Having spent a week at the Akti Myrina on Limnos eight months ago, it gave
me idle pleasure to compare the brochure's up-beat assessment of the hotel
and the island with my own recollections.
The brochure calls the Akti Myrina one of Greece's finest hotels,
emphasising its 'sublime accommodation on a peaceful island undisturbed by
tourism' and waxing lyrical about its friendliness, setting (125
stone-walled cottages dotted over 20 acres of parkland), sports facilities
(not just water sports - yawn - but tennis) and food.
My experience of Greek hotels is limited, but I am happy with the brochure's
claim that many guests return to the Akti Myrina year after year and almost
look on it as a second home.
As for Limnos, The Best of Greece correctly describes it as peaceful, with a
quaint little capital, and 'dry and hot in summer but blessed with many fine
sandy bays and beaches.'
Perfectly true. What the brochure does not mention is the wind on Limnos. It
is an extremely windy island. I hired an open jeep for a couple of days and
my executive assistant, Miss Lee, travelling with me, was almost blown up
into the sky, while my efforts at sunbathing on the hotel's beach were
constantly thwarted. No muscle-clad bully kicked sand in my face; the wind
did it for him.
Prices at the Akti Myrina for holidays booked through The Best of Greece are
on a half-board basis (dinner and breakfast) and include economy flights.
Drinks are expensive.
If you can avoid the peak period, prices at the Akti Myrina between June
1-July 12 and August 31-September 28 (from London) range from approximately
Pounds 885 per person for seven nights in a twin standard cottage (Pounds
1,400 for 14 nights) to approximately Pounds 1,160 pp in a duplex front row
(two-bathroom) cottage (Pounds 1,900 for 14 nights).
Single cottages are available. These prices do not include transport to UK
airports, watersports, excursions, drink or insurance.
The Best of Greece: 100 Week Street, Maidstone, Kent ME14 1RG, tele:

FT  23 MAY 92 / Travel: Boutique hotels hit town - A luxurious and intimate
experience
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   IN THE US they are called 'boutique hotels'
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
not a pretty name. In London, they do not seem to have any recognised name
at all. But if the recently-coined term 'town house hotel' has yet to catch
on in London, the establishments it describes have.
Hidden away, meticulously managed, and each with an intimate atmosphere
entirely its own, London's small luxury hotels can make their better-known
cousins seem not so much grand as over-sized.
More than 1,100 hotels cater to 17m visitors in London each year, and there
are plenty that are neither large nor cheap. Yet there are only 25 or so
that fall into the small, luxury 'town house' bracket - something like 300
rooms in all.
Generally, these hotels are to be found in converted private houses in quiet
residential streets. Invariably, they serve a full morning meal, though only
a few have a restaurant of their own. None are members of a hotel chain, and
are instead privately owned. What is it that makes these hotels something
other than glorified B &amp; Bs? Not long ago I went on a four-day bed-hopping
spree to find out.
A stones's throw from the Victoria and Albert Museum, the Egerton House
Hotel sits in a street off the Brompton Road in Knightsbridge. Like its
owner, David Naylor Leyland, it is discreet, under-stated and traditional.
Two years ago, after 50 wins as an amateur jumps jockey, Naylor Leyland
broke his neck while steeplechasing. Ever since, he has put his energy into
hotels rather than horses.
I met him in the drawing room, a place where he is often found chatting to
guests or sharing an evening drink. It has an elegant, residential
atmosphere; there are oil portraits on the walls, books and newspapers by
the fireplace - and, in the adjacent study, an 'honesty bar' where guests
serve themselves from a side table. His application of the town house
concept is simple.
Cut out areas that are costly and often loss-making - restaurants, public
bars, lobby facilities and the large staffs that go with them - and you can
still provide a wide range of luxury services and accommodation at prices
that undercut the large hotels. Single rooms at the Egerton begin at under
Pounds 100.
On opening my door at the Sloane Hotel, a tiny establishment of just 12
rooms in Chelsea, I first felt somewhat put out. The room beyond was full of
lovely antiques, but it seemed slightly small.
On one side of the room, though, there was a wooden banister. I moved over
to it, and was astonished to find myself gazing down onto a room of enormous
height and the grey silk canopy, draperies and tassels of a four-poster bed.
Like all the rooms in the Sloane, its Pounds 150 gallery suites offer lavish
and surprising design.
With its wall tapestries, walnut antiques, silver-backed brushes and
crochet-bordered sheets, spending a night there was rather like staying in a
grand, highly decorated private country house. But as in all of London's
small luxury hotels, the American vision of what an English country house
should be - Colefax and Fowler-inspired chintzes, frills and floral patterns
 -is conspicuously absent.
Like other town house hotel owners, the Sloane's Sue Rogers, an interior
decorator, puts the stamp of her individual taste and style on every room,
traditional, contemporary or neo-classical.
Hidden behind the reception desk at the recently opened Halkin Hotel near
Hyde Park Corner lies an office resembling Nasa's mission control. A
bewildering display of consols, monitors and computer screens, it is the
electronic heart of the most modern, high-tech hotel in London. What in
God's name, I wondered, as I peeked at this gadgetry, can the rooms be like?
Apart from a fax machine and two telephones on the desk, there was no sign
of any silicon-chip wizardry in my Pounds 300 room. The luxury of the large
marble bathroom was far more striking. The 41 rooms at the Halkin are of
Italian minimalist design: stark lines and empty space are as much
responsible for an air of opulence as stylish, Milan-imported furnishings
and art pieces.
But the high tech was there nonetheless, security-recording room entries,
automatically allocating private fax numbers, electronically prioritising
butler's room calls and duties. It is all as unobtrusive and professional as
the service in the Halkin's Italian-nouvelle Gualtiero Marchesi restaurant.
This is a hotel as much for the modern aesthete as the pressured
businessman.
My favourite little luxury hotel, though, is Blakes in South Kensington,
something of an institution among celebrities, fashion and media people in
London. Quite simply, it is self-indulgent fun. This is a place where a
little fantasising comes easily.
Behind the fantasy lies a meticulous attention to detail and decoration.
Owner Anouska Hempel blends fabrics, furniture and accessories, and carries
individual themes and colours across whole floors of the 50-room hotel.
My own Pounds 295 room, in black and gold, positively glowed. Light,
bleached floorboards stained with black diamond patterns; black silk walls
covered with 36 gilt-framed lithographs; polished Biedermeier furniture; a
four-poster bed festooned with masses of fabric - as the hours passed, all
conspired to carry me light years from the grey weather and the anonymous
city that lay outside my window.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Food: Elizabeth David - Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS hard to convey just what Elizabeth David, who died in her sleep at
home yesterday, came to mean to the post-war generation of Britons who were
starved of sunshine, warmth and alternatives to roast beef and cabbage.
Born in 1913, one of four daughters of Rupert Sackville Gwynne, MP, and
Stella Ridley, her interest in food was first awakened by a girlhood stay in
a greedy Parisian household. Later, she vividly evoked in her writing the
intense pleasure and excitement that sensitively produced food could convey.
Its contribution to the warmth and well being of a people, its proper roots
in the culture of a nation that she first observed in France came to be the
mainspring of her life's work.
When A Book of Mediterranean Food was published in 1950 it brought to a
still-rationed Britain not just some seductive recipes - cassoulets,
bouillabaisses, ratatouilles - but an evocation of a warmer, more sensual
way of life.
It was this instinctive feeling for authentic food, for its relationship to
the country, the seasons, the people, coupled with a scholarly approach and
a controlled romanticism in the prose, that made her books both
authoritative and readable even to those who never lifted a saucepan.
French Country Cooking (1951), Italian Food (1954) and Summer Cooking (1955)
followed, each as scholarly, each as evocative of time and place as
Mediterranean Food, and each still meriting permanent places on the
bookshelves of any serious cook.
The end of her life was marred by ill health and she became an increasingly
awesome figure, difficult to communicate with but scholarly to the end. My
last communication from her came a few months ago in the form of a crisp
little letter, ticking me off for referring, as I had jokily done, to
'rustic cooking pots from the Ardennes.' 'There are no rustic cooking pots
from the Ardennes - they are made in the Auvergne.'
Her authority, her feel for simplicity coupled with a dislike of pretension,
are the qualities that will make sure that her books will be with us long
after her beloved France is more renowned for Big Macs than bouillabaisse.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Food: Braised oxtails: the glory that was Rome . . . - Chef
Franco Taruschio explains some Italian regional food fads
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROMAN FOOD is less well known than that of some other regions of Italy,
notably Tuscany, Piedmont, Emilia Romagna and Milan. The region is hotter
and the countryside poorer; covered with the same ragged sheep which appear
in the landscapes of Guido Reni or Claude Lorraine. There are few star
winemakers to give encouragement to the chefs, but this does not mean that
Roman food lacks a distinctive flavour or that the Romans do not have strong
opinions about what they like.
This became clear in a simple Roman cafe one morning. The owner and his wife
were decrying the culinary innovations which threatened the 'good old' food
of the city. 'We were quite happy with our braised oxtails,' they said, 'and
sausages with polenta.' They lost me, however, when they began speaking of a
notable treat: the intestines of 30-day-old lambs, still filled with their
mothers' milk, and served on a bed of gnocchi.
Fortunately I had the best of interpreters in Franco Taruschio, of the
Walnut Tree in Abergavenny. Franco comes from the Marches on the Adriatic
coast, which is near enough to Rome to allow him some understanding of the
city's gastronomic predilections.
We had just come from the market in the Piazza Vittorio Emanuele II, where
we had examined piles of expensive ceps looking distinctly ropey at the end
of the season; stalls selling every conceivable variety of flour, from rice
and potato to chick pea; huge piles of pecorino cheese made from the milk of
Sardinian and Roman sheep (and rather larger stacks of Parmigiano Reggiano
from Emilia Romagna); live carp and eels, their gills quivering; swordfish
and one-eyed scampi from the Adriatic; dingy and aqueous lumps of meat
enlivened by half-shaved haunches of boar, thrushes and, of course, oxtail.
The day before, Franco had hunted down a couple of up and coming Roman
restaurants. Da Paris (Piazza S. Calisto, 7A. Tel: 585378) is in Trastevere.
The name celebrates a former owner, and has nothing to do with Paris,
France; in fact the cooking is a tribute to the Jewish Roman tradition - the
old ghetto is about a kilometre away.
An excellent bresaola made from beef topside formed a simple antipasto with
some fresh anchovies marinated in lemon juice. Chick peas replaced the usual
beans in the pasta soup; a shellfish risotto came with big pieces of fish. I
braved the tripe alla romana which came with grated pecorino cheese rather
than the usual parmesan. (The guts had been well cleaned, and the meat was
less pungent and more delicate than most.) The others ate a selection of
fried food which was billed as quintessentially Roman.
Deep fried food is one of the hallmarks of Roman cooking; as it was once
that of both Lyon and Paris. Da Paris did an interesting mixture of
different things cooked in a light batter: artichokes, delicious marrow
flowers and dried cod or bacala. The pudding, too, was deep fried: palle or
balls of ricotta. Originally these were called St Calisto's Balls, but in
deference to the dedicatee of the church opposite, this title has been
dropped. The deep fried ricotta was filled with chocolate and cinnamon, with
a little sambuca. Da Paris is highly recommended to anyone visiting Rome.
Per head with good wine: Pounds 40.
Our second choice, Il Cardinale near the Pantheon (Via delle Carcere 6. Tel:
686-93-36) was a bit of a busted flush. Adriana Montellanico's cooking
started out promisingly, but began to falter halfway through the meal.
Brioche was served with a little mousse of mascarpone cheese and anchovies;
this was followed by some artichokes stewed in olive oil (alla romana) and a
salad of pigs' trotters. Dried cod was again the principal ingredient of
ravioli alla bacala, which was excellent under its rich tomato sauce. Also
good was a roulade of pasta stuffed with ceps, parmigiano reggiano and cream
cheese.
The main courses proved disappointing: rabbit fillet in a sauce of rosemary,
garlic and wild fennel seemed to lack texture, while some dried cod in a
sauce with grapes proved, I thought, a mistake. The puddings were better,
especially my crostata, which looked somewhat like a Linzertorte of candied
orange peel, a typically Roman dish. A sort of soup of mille-feuilles was
not so exciting. The meal cost about Pounds 40 a head, including wine.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Food: Haute cuisine fights to survive - The dangers facing a
classic style of cooking
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS LANDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHEF David Wilson has been extolling the virtues of stews, casseroles and
braised oxtail - dishes not particularly associated with restaurant dining
rooms in Britain nowadays. Wilson, chef/proprietor of the Peat Inn, Fife,
applauded their return to popularity at a conference for Scottish chefs.
His speech came just two months after another exponent of such dishes,
Antony Worrall Thompson, proposed at the annual chefs' conference in
Birmingham that 'Haute cuisine is dead.' His audience of 104 chefs, schooled
in classical French cooking and trained predominantly in hotel kitchens,
defeated the motion 101-3.
The simple explanation for the size of this majority can only be that these
chefs were too preoccupied with their stocks, sauces and demi-glaces to see
what is happening front of house. For in the present economic climate, haute
cuisine may not be dead but it is fighting for life.
Around Britain, there are certain restaurateurs doing the kind of business
others only dream about. In spite of the recession, you have to book well in
advance for a table at Kensington Place, Clarke's or the Greenhouse in
London; the Ubiquitous Chip in Glasgow; or the Walnut Tree Inn at
Abergavenny. Their foods and wines are good and their prices reasonable.
But the size of the bill is only one factor. Restaurants are public places
where conspicuous consumption, the theme of the 1980s but the antithesis of
the 1990s, takes place. As a result, the most expensive restaurants
specialising in haute cuisine are not part of the same industry which most
restaurant-goers frequent. They are in the luxury market alongside
Rolls-Royces, hand-made suits or a costly cuvee from a top champagne house.
As managing directors, eyeing static company sales, forsake their expensive
cars and cut back on champagne - the UK champagne market was down 34 per
cent in 1991 - so they will be less likely to want to be seen on their way
to the nearest three-star restaurant.
Top French chefs and restaurateurs counter with two arguments. First, the
principles of haute cuisine must be pursued in order that the discipline of
cooking can progress. Second, haute cuisine has already seen off various
challenges ranging from nouvelle cuisine to the anti-butter lobby. But, as
well as running the risk of ignoring their customers, they ignore science,
economics and developing tastes, too.
The principles of haute cuisine were laid down by Auguste Escoffier early in
the 20th century; since then these principles have been developed but not
seriously challenged. Today, the impetus for challenging them comes not from
the kitchen but from the laboratory, as Harold McGee shows in his
fascinating new book The Curious Cook (HarperCollins Pounds 15.99).
The economic factors are even more compelling. There will simply be fewer
and fewer restaurateurs able to swallow the huge capital and running costs
involved in opening a new top French-style restaurant. Significantly,
London's two newest restaurants offering haute cuisine, the Mirabelle and
Les Saveurs (where, at a recent dinner, the customer/staff ratio was 1:3),
have been opened by wealthy Japanese businessmen obviously able to adopt
their characteristically long-term view to such an investment.
There will also be fewer chefs able to travel the world extolling the
virtues of this style of cooking. In the 1970s and '80s, the world was keen
to swallow everything the top French chefs could put before it. There was a
travelling circus which included, among others, Messieurs Bocuse, Verge and
Blanc, who could afford to leave their stoves to preach the gospel in
London, New York or Tokyo. But the latest generation of top French chefs
does not have this opportunity. If they travel, each has to be replaced in
his kitchen by someone equally skilled and salaried. It makes more sense to
stay home and cook.
History could, however, supply the final nail in the coffin of haute
cuisine. For generations, chefs from all over the world have learnt their
skills the French way, honed them with an occasional 'stage' in a top French
kitchen and aimed at copying the very best which only the French could do.
Now, a new generation of chefs around the world - in Britain, America,
Australia, Germany and Japan - has the confidence to experiment, and the
means (via television, cheap travel and a global market for the best
produce) to create new dishes which their customers enjoy and can afford.
Today, the cuisine which is the most adaptable, and considered to be the
most beneficial to our health, comes not from France but from Italy  - the
country from which France imported all the best cooks in Europe 450 years
ago.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Wine: A visit to the claret frontier - Castillon wines are
worth tasting
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EDMUND PENNING-ROWSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON THE eastern frontier of the Gironde, opposite the department of the
Dordogne, lies the small red wine district of the Cotes de Castillon. The
town it is based on is called Castillon-La-Bataille, commemorating a defeat,
in the year 1453, which led to the withdrawal of the English from south-west
France.
The Cotes (which include nine communes) are a continuation of St Emilion in
soil composition and grape varieties. In the last century, under that name,
they had a high reputation. But then came a succession of setbacks:
phylloxera; the banning - in 1921 - of St Emilion or St Emilionnais on their
labels; and the start of the Appellation Controlee system in 1935. This
reduced the Cotes to little more than generic red Bordeaux; vins de
medecine, used by the Bordeaux trade to give body and character to weaker
wines from elsewhere in the huge Gironde region.
The position improved in 1955, when the appellation Bordeaux Cotes de
Castillon was approved. And then, in 1989, the word Bordeaux did not have to
be shown on the label; it is now little used.
This is Merlot country, as in St Emilion. An average of 70 per cent of the
grapes are Merlot, as demonstrated by the single co-operative in Gardegan.
The balance of grapes is about 25 per cent Cabernet Franc, with a little
Cabernet Sauvignon, although there are exceptions. The wines are less tannic
than Bourg and Blaye. other Cotes wines.
As in St Emilion, the soil composition varies. Near the river it is more
sandy and alluvial. But on the slopes, and above all on the plateau, it is
clay-chalk, producing bigger, better-structured and longer-living wines. On
a recent visit to the two plateau estates of Castegens and Pitray, I drank
1962s which had plenty of colour, body and character.
Castillon wines generally have deep colour, well maintained with age, a
welcoming aroma which may recall blackcurrants, chocolate or tobacco, and a
powerful but not a coarse taste. Of recent vintages, I found the '90s,
shortly to be bottled, outstanding for their concentration. The '89s have,
perhaps, more elegance.
The '88s are big, firm, traditional clarets. They should keep very well,
though for current consumption I tasted more than one '87 which made very
agreeable drinking. The '86s still have that strike on the palate, but the
'85s are probably at their best: the vintage I would choose for drinking
now, and for several years ahead. The '83s are softer, and for opening
fairly soon.
To buy for laying down, I would acquire '90 and '89. I tasted a range of 16
of the latter (not including those of the two mentioned above) and they are
certainly not ready. For the record, those I preferred were Belcier, Grand
Tertre, Hauts de Poupille, Lavergne, Poupille, Peyrou and Roc de Joanne.
Among other properties I visited, whose wines appealed to me, were Grand
Tuillac, Blanzac, Brehat, Montpezat, Estaign and Flojague - but these were a
handful in a district carpeted with vines.
Estate names to be found on UK merchant lists will largely depend on those
favoured by the Bordeaux merchants. Belcier and Pitray may be commoner than
most: also Dom La Clariere, owned by Tony Laithwaite, head of Bordeaux
Direct, whose wines are sold in its shops in Reading and elsewhere in
southern England.
However, about 40 per cent of Castillon wines are still sold in bulk to the
Bordeaux trade, where they lose their identity in branded blends. A further
substantial percentage, depending on the individual estate, is sold direct
to private clients within France.
A growing problem is the use of oak barrels to mature the bottled wines,
which are nearly all developed in cement vats, (though some stainless steel
is used for this and for fermentation). Experiments with oak are being
applied in wealthy properties like Castegens, Belcier and Estaign, and in
other cellars a few barrels will be seen, but the problem is not only the
cost of the barrels - FFr3,000 for new ones, and half that for two-year-olds
 -but the fact that it puts up the ex-chateau price to the Bordeaux trade by
an unacceptable FFr6 to FFr10 a bottle.
Traditionally, Castillon has lived in the shadow of St Emilion and even its
immediate neighbour, the 'satellite' Puissegin-St Emilion, secures a per
tonneau (1,200 bottles) price of FFr12,000 compared with Castillon's
FFr8,000.
Prices of some Castillon wines on UK lists appear unnecessarily high in
relation to growers' receipts, for they should cost from Pounds 4.50 to
Pounds 6 a bottle. As with other lesser Bordeaux appellations, few foreign
buyers seem to have the time or opportunity for personal visits and direct
buying.
The Cote commune of St Philippe boasts the highest above-sea-level height in
the whole Gironde - more than 350 ft - and the district has surely the most
engaging countryside in the whole department, with steep valleys, tree-lined
hills, and old stone villages and hamlets. The vineyard estates include such
impressive 15th century castles as Castegens and Flojague, and the fantastic
mid-19th century Pitray, in Viollet le Duc renaissance-style
The cellars of these and other properties are open to visitors by
appointment. This can be obtained through the office of the Syndicat
Viticole des Cotes de Castillon in the Allees de la Republique in that town.

FT  23 MAY 92 / How to Spend It: Perfect for summer parties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SEASON of summer parties, of marquees in the garden, of picnics and of
weddings is upon us. For most of us that means catering on a scale that
tests the resources of even the most amply equipped houses.
Top Table is worth knowing about because it specialises in hiring out
anything and everything the party table might need - but in quantity.
Although many companies offer this service what is perhaps different about
Top Table is its range of exceptionally attractive tableware.
There is, for instance, a chic, striped collection and a smart black and
white group due in the autumn. There is plain white china, with a raised
fruit pattern on the sides, and colourful fruit patterned china which is
fresh and springlike, with a white background, or darkly decorative with a
black background.
There is a choice of handblown bubble glasses, tablecloths and napkins.
Large black candelabra can also be supplied and would suit a function in a
barn or marquee.
Based in Northamptonshire, the company will deliver all the hired pieces
free within a 15-mile radius, otherwise a charge, according to distance, has
to be made. For details contact: Top Table Hire, Moors Farm, West Farndon,
Daventry, Northants. Tel: 0327-60575.
REMEMBER the string bag? Once a hotter than hot little number in the 1960s
it was ousted by the plastic bag as a worthy receptacle for pop art. Then,
in the 1980s, came designer label shoppings bags. Shops such as Browns,
Hermes, Joseph and Chanel were as popular for the chic conveyed by their
bags as their labels.
In the eco-conscious 90s the string bag is making a comeback. Paper, we are
told,is bad - all those forests - and plastic is worse  - all those
chemicals that eat up ever-diminishing resources. The fad first resurfaced
in New York and has now reached the UK. Reusable and made of 100 per cent
cotton in natural, yellow, orange, red, blue, green, and black, the bags can
be crumpled up small inside a handbag and emerge later. String bags can now
be bought from retailers including The Conran Shop, Michelin House, 81
Fulham Road, London SW3 and Neal Street East, Neal Street, London WC2 as
well as by mail from The String Bag Company. It is offering three - one
beach bag, one shoulder bag and one shopping bag - for Pounds 11 plus Pounds
1 to cover postage and packing. Tel: 071-581-0196 or write to The String Bag
Company, 50 Lombard Road, London SW11 3RY.

FT  23 MAY 92 / How to Spend It: The art of being a crafty shopper - Lucia
van der Post picks some exceptionally fine presents from some of Britain's
best young craftsmen and women
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCIA VAN DER POST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOSE WITH a taste for fine craftsmanship are spoilt for choice. At Liberty
in Regent Street, London, there is a wonderful selection of furniture,
paintings and objects from the Arts and Crafts period; in Bath a
contemporary arts and crafts fair opens today and, at London's Goldsmiths'
Hall, a display of work by some of Britain's best goldsmiths and
silversmiths opens on Wednesday.
Do not be discouraged from going to any of these simply because your price
bracket is more Marks &amp; Spencer than Fortnums - much of the pleasure offered
by these exhibitions is the chance to wander around and look at exceptional
work. Even those in the mood to spend nothing should find much to delight
the eye.
At Liberty the arts and crafts exhibition is now an established annual event
 -the 19th in a row where furniture, metalwork, glass, ceramics and
jewellery from the period are not just on show but also for sale.
Although the Arts and Crafts Movement spanned roughly the years 1870 to 1890
for this year's exhibition Liberty has some particularly fine pieces from
the height of the movement, around the turn of the century, with pieces from
Arthur Liberty himself, JS Henry, Heals and the Cotswold school. There will
be desks and tables, fireplaces and a set of four Liberty chairs taken from
a CFA Voysey design, as well as a group of pre-Raphaelite paintings,
including an Edward Burne-Jones.
Arts and Crafts furniture, it has to be said, is not to everybody's taste
but for those who want to be know more about it - and perhaps gauge whether
it is or is not - this is a perfect opportunity.
What almost everybody can relate to instantly is the jewellery of the
period. Tania Hunter, of Cobra &amp; Bellamy, who used to deal in jewellery of
this period, has been putting a collection together for some years. The
result can be seen and bought at the Cobra &amp; Bellamy counter at Liberty as
well as the shop at 149 Sloane Street, London SW1.
As you can see from the photographs here, the pieces are almost without
exception exceedingly beautiful, finely made and highly desirable. Today
these pieces, sadly for would-be buyers, fetch high prices - at the time the
designers' use of relatively inexpensive materials such as horn and glass,
silver and Bakelite, and the deeply held belief that artistic merit was more
important than the inherent value of the materials used, was revolutionary
in the jewel world.
Most items are collectors' pieces so they are not cheap. Two of the finest,
the CR Ashbee silver and gold brooch, enamelled and set with pearls and an
amethyst, and the Archibald Knox platinum, diamond and moonstone pendant,
cost Pounds 5,950 each. There are a few smaller things for sale, such as a
small silver brooch at Pounds 200, a couple of pendants at Pounds 350 and a
carved jade pendant at Pounds 500.
At The Goldsmiths' Hall there is dazzling confirmation that when it comes to
jewellery, silver or gold, from earrings to goblets, ceremonial platters and
tiaras, domestic cutlery, or anything from clocks to rings, the current crop
of British designers are hard to beat. No wonder the Middle Eastern palaces,
the Japanese board-rooms and the world's posh private houses are filled with
the work of bright British jewellers and goldsmiths.
The work of between 50 and 60 designers will be there for all to see.
Although none of it carries price-tags most of the designers will be at the
exhibition and anyone longing for a particular piece will usually be able to
come to some arrangement. Even if the particular piece on show is not for
sale something very similar can always be commissioned.
Anyone who has a special anniversary coming up, a birthday, a retirement
party, a christening or a wedding, will find it a fruitful scouting ground.
It is encouraging to see that several of the independent retailers, having
noted and reacted against the growing influence of the multiples, now see
more exciting and better design as a useful tool in the battle for
customers. Even retailers that were once renowned for grandiose candelabra
and 'repro' candlesticks now have corners or counters devoted to more
exciting modern work.
Some of the stores worth noting are: Garrards of Regent Street, London W1;
Asprey of 165 New Bond Street, London W1; Boodle &amp; Dunthorne of 58 Brompton
Road, London SW3, 52 Eastgate Street, Chester, Lord Street, Liverpool and
King Street, Manchester; David Robinson of Church Alley, Liverpool, St
Michael's Row, Chester, St Anne's Square, Manchester, Lord Street, Stockport
and Makinson Arcade, Wigan; David Thomaas, of 65 Pimlico Rd, London SW1 and
Hancocks of Manchester.
In Bath there is yet more contemporary work - this time in the field of
ceramics, glass, wood, furniture, jewellery, knitwear, fashion accessories
and the like - to be looked at, admired and possibly bought.
Based very much on the format of the now well-established Chelsea craft
fair, the organisers have gathered some 100 different craftspeople and
anything from candles to bracelets, from handbags to pottery can be seen.
Prices vary enormously - most of the work is aimed at everyday usage and is
not as precious and fine as that at the Goldsmiths - from a few pounds to
several hundred. Again, it is a marvellous chance to do some present buying,
to replenish some of the things you might need for your own house and to
catch up on the work that more than 100 exhibitors are up to.
Bear in mind that it is not just jewellers and silversmiths that like to
make works to commission. Most of the craftspeople at Bath love nothing more
than the chance to produce a one-off design - whether it be to knit up a
sweater in a special colour or pattern, do a range of pottery to match an
existing set, paint some furniture to fit into a given room or produce a
piece of fine jewellery or silver. Anyone whose work you like can be
negotiated with.
The Arts and Crafts exhibition at Liberty, Regent Street, London W1. is on
until June 13.
The Contemporary Designer arts and crafts fair is on at the Bath Arts,
Crafts and Design Centre in St Andrews Terrace, Bath, from today until
Tuesday.
British Goldsmiths of Today at Goldsmiths' Hall, Foster Lane, London EC2V,
will run from Wednesday until June 26.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Floating a theatre company - How
Walk the Plank got their financial act together and took to the sea
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANNIE WILSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Fitzcarraldo is an iron-clad Norwegian island ferry formerly named the
Bjarkov. It bears little resemblance to the 350-ton steamship Werner Herzog
hauled through the jungle in his film about building an opera house in
Amazonia, from which the old ferry gets its new name, except in the
proportions of its voyage and the dreams which made it possible.
The ship sailed into the grey waters of Glasson Dock, just south of
Lancaster, early in the New Year. The storms had been tremendous, the wait
in the Caledonian Canal long and expensive, but at last she arrived to dwarf
every other vessel in the marina and capture the imagination of the small
fishing village. The adventure had begun.
The Fitzcarraldo is the achievement of a dream for John Wassell and Liz Pugh
and their company Walk the Plank, the 'world's first marine theatre
contractors.' Their vision: to tour a theatre ship around the beaches and
docks of Britain during the summer. There are two shows: one an extravagant
fairy tale with a 'green' environmental theme, written for them by Adrian
Mitchell, the poet and playwright; the other a pyrotechnic spectacular for
up to 2,000 people, combining music, magic, drama and dance with fireworks.
The project has attracted arts departments around the coast, and the ship is
booked from May to September. It started at the Brighton Festival last week
and arrives in Folkestone today.
'I think people like the spirit of adventure, the romance of it appeals,'
says Liz. 'And conventional arts departments know that people who wouldn't
necessarily buy tickets for the theatre or go to an art gallery might come
and see our show.'
Bringing the dream to life has been hard work. Their success in selling the
tour, raising a Pounds 40,000 Arts Council grant and an Pounds 82,000 bank
loan secured by the Small Firms Loan Guarantee scheme - no mean achievement
in the depths of recession - has been dulled somewhat by the extra costs of
the delays en route from Norway and of converting the ship to UK marine
specifications.
But enthusiasm has not dimmed. The bank manager was persuaded (with
difficulty) to extend the loan, the decks and sides of the ship were
transformed with riotous paintwork, the rear deck has been converted into a
seating area for an audience of 150 and the company of performers and
musicians is ready for anything the seas can throw at it.
'The project has a momentum that can't be stopped,' says Liz Pugh, a former
marketing and publicity officer for Manchester's Royal Exchange Theatre, the
arts company Welfare State International ('engineers of the imagination'),
and Barrow Borough Council.
Her experience of boats was limited to the Norfolk Broads until three years
ago, when she and John Wassell bought a wooden launch which proved the
starting point for the Fitzcarraldo project. They spent the summers of 1989
and 1990 touring the Scottish islands with the Boat Band, literally singing
for their supper. 'That was the springboard for this idea, to expand it into
a show on a ship, although it was a leap of the imagination from a 50ft boat
to a 120ft ship with a 28ft beam.'
For John, a builder of wooden narrow boats before a five-year stint as
project director for WSI, it was a lesser leap. Having organised large,
site-specific events for WSI, and experienced the immense cost of touring,
he realised that keeping everything on board ship would cut costs.
As Liz explains: 'Moving people and large props around is a costly process,
but on board it all comes in one little steel package: our total fuel bill
for the summer is Pounds 5,000 (for 12 venues) - a fraction of the cost of
bed and breakfast and transport.
'One of the disadvantages of touring Europe is the costs involved. The idea
should hold good for plans to take the show abroad in future years.'
Glasson Dock is a small village but it has taken Liz and John to its heart.
Over the last three years the couple have turned the traditional Bonfire
Night of November 5 into a community event for 1,500 people, with a
children's lantern procession and a 30-strong organising committee. Word
about the Fitzcarraldo project spread like wildfire.
'They all knew the ship was coming because we sold them sea miles to raise
funds,' Liz said, 'and then it took so long, two months instead of three
weeks, that when it arrived it was very exciting. We were inundated with
offers of anything from carpets to welding equipment, and all offers of help
(there was a constant stream of willing helpers) were accepted.'
Money may be tight indeed, but when the ship sailed at the beginning of May
there was a distinct feeling that, if nothing else, the goodwill of the
community alone would keep it afloat.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Minding Your Own Business: A baby boom in a barn - A growing
business hidden down a country lane
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HILARY DE BOERR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TUCKED away on Nizels Lane, a winding country lane in rural Kent, is a 16th
century tithe barn surrounded by cackling geese and two Vietnamese
pot-bellied pigs. Three days a week, a discreet signboard is carried down to
the entrance of the driveway, the only clue to the bustling business going
on behind closed doors.
The pastel pink and blue board tells you that the barn is home to Nippers, a
novel company selling nursery goods, equipment and toys. Julia Cassell, the
founder, began the business in Hildenborough nine years ago with a Pounds
500 investment, and now boasts an annual turnover of Pounds 250,000.
Cassell appears to have found the ideal growth industry. 'Baby boomers' are
having babies later in life, and have money to spend. Their own parents -
the grandparents - also have more disposable income. Research indicates that
the baby boomers' baby boom will continue for several years. And, as Cassell
says: 'The last thing people want to cut back on is their child.'
When Cassell started Nippers in 1983 - a way of working from home part-time
while her children were young - she offered only second-hand goods.
Pleasantly surprised by the demand, she decided to offer new products.
The area's high street retailers were not best pleased. 'I'll close you down
if it's the last thing I do,' was the message from one. The local residents
were not too thrilled at the idea of suppliers and shoppers trundling down
the country lane - and started a petition to stop the enterprise. A further
obstacle came from the nursery goods manufacturers, who were not initially
interested in Cassell's 'small time' venture.
Such challenges made Cassell even more determined. Spurred on by the need to
pay her children's school fees, and by a burning desire to prove herself in
business - having underachieved at school - she dug in her heels.
'I've chosen an interesting industry,' she says. 'It's a caring, nurturing
one - nurturing the mother - but then I've got to get the knife into
somebody the other side. It's a constant balance of being both a carer and a
business person.'
She has never borrowed money; with a high turnaround of stock, Nippers has
always been self-financing. She has few overheads: advertising costs,
employee wages and a small mortgage taken on when she bought out her
brother's share of the farm property they inherited. Her husband, Clive, who
runs his own business as a quantity surveyor, helps with Nippers'
administration, while brother Michael, an accountant, acts as finance
director. They appear to make a good team, combining Cassell's creative
flair and energy, her husband's common sense, her brother's expertise.
Cassell's marketing approach is simple. Why battle the high streets when you
can take a leisurely drive out to the country to the relaxed atmosphere of
the barn? The children can play in the playground, the parents can try out
the goods at their leisure, and the cost can be significantly lower. Cassell
passes on discounts obtained from the manufacturers - for example, buying
end-of-line products - and can sell prams Pounds 100 cheaper than high
street competitors. Most shoppers spend Pounds 50-Pounds 60 a visit.
Nippers is open on three days only, and even then with limited hours for
trade - because the premises are in a green belt area. The local authority
allows only 14 1/2 hours of business a week. Nevertheless, Cassell says that
on a Saturday morning alone the shop can take in as much as a small, local
high street shop makes in two to three weeks. She has had to hire two
full-time and six part-time employees. 'The recession doesn't seem to have
affected us at all,' she says.
Cassell is well aware of how a home-run business can take over one's life;
she used to work for Relate, as a marriage guidance counsellor. She has two
rules: she must have time for her three children and husband, and the
business must not affect the family finances. Until two years ago she took
no steady income from Nippers, ploughing all the profits back into it, while
the family lived off her husband's income.
Nippers Hildenborough has matured so successfully that it gave birth last
year to Nippers UK Franchising. Cassell, her husband and brother invested
Pounds 50,000 in the new venture, aiming to have 70 franchises around
Britain in five years' time. The first franchise opened last September, and
Cassell has had over 80 inquiries for others since last December. Old barns,
granny annexes, stables and even warehouses round the UK could get a new
lease of life.

FT  23 MAY 92 / As They Say in Europe: The Season in full bloom - An Italian
fascinated by English roses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COUNT Paolo Filo Della Torre has officially opened the Season, so, English
society can proceed to enjoy itself.
Count Paolo is the London correspondent of the Rome paper La Repubblica, and
has been in the UK since time immemorial. He must be the doyen of the
foreign press corps - and possibly the only real gentleman among the lot.
Filo Della Torre was in his element on Tuesday. 'Elizabeth of England,
dressed in mauve, opened the Chelsea flower show, the most beautiful
exhibition of flowers in the world. It has been held since 1913 in May in
the park of the Royal Hospital . . . The show, together with Royal Ascot,
the garden parties of Buckingham Palace, the picnics in the garden of the
opera house of Glyndebourne in Sussex, the summer exhibition of the Royal
Academy, glorious Goodwood and the speech from the throne in the House of
Lords, provides one of the dates of the Season.'
Purists may quibble with some of this, the Queen did not exactly open the
show, but that hardly matters in Count Paolo's latest celebration of
Englishness. It was he who published the only known Guide to Margaret
Thatcher's England; where Finchley is, how to get to Grantham, and so on.
The flower show is placed in the fullest, and most elegant, context. Having
described it as 'Proustian' in atmosphere, but with no need to go 'in the
search of times past,' he continues: 'For the English from age three to 103,
flowers are an irresistible attraction. Napoleon called the British a nation
of shopkeepers, but in reality they constitute a nation of gardeners, and
the most fascinating and delicate of the women are known as an 'English
rose,' a compliment which is often directed at Lady Diana.'
It may seem surprising that the paper should devote so much space to the
Chelsea flower show but there is a good reason. Count Paolo shrewdly
included a list of Italian notables who were present at this august
gathering. Among them were Simonetta Scalferi and Carlo Caracciolo. On
investigation they turn out to be, respectively, the wife of the editor of
La Repubblica and the chairman of the board.
The delights of start of the Season are a harbinger of those of summer and
the week's fine weather brought out a rash of stories on holiday themes:
drought, the problems of timesharing and motorway madness.
In reporting the findings of the French 'Court of Accounts,' in its
investigation into the finances of the autroutes, Liberation noted the
marvellous business opportunities offered by feasibility studies for new
motorways, opportunities which only rarely involve actual construction.
In Lisieux, a series of studies had been commissioned for competing routes
for the past 20 years but no decision has been reached.
The toll system is the bane of British drivers in France but, now, they will
be able to point to the latest report as evidence of its absurdity. Thus,
Liberation notes, having once granted a concession for a toll-motorway, the
local authorities are still compelled to maintain the route nationale which
runs parallel in order to meet the obligation to provide a free service. The
result is that the whole system seems to be bust - the paper says that the
eight companies which operate it have FFr112bn (Pounds 11.3bn) of debt,
FFr1.8bn of capital and receipts stand at a mere FFr15bn annually.
Such figures might scupper British plans for private toll roads. And
revelations in El Pais could help do the same to some Spanish time-share
operations.
You may have wondered what happens when Spaniards try to sell timeshares to
each other. Not much, it seems - only 2,000 have invested in such projects.
The account in El Pais opens thus, ''Hello, I'm Pilar.' And the charming
senorita from one of those firms accompanies them into what looks like a
bingo hall where Mariles and Manolo undergo two hours of sheer oppression.'
Consumer organisations are up in arms about the system, there are no checks
on the intimidatory techniques that the writer, Angeles Espinosa, alleges
she found. The promoters, under Spanish law, are entitled to call a
timeshare apartment the 'property' of the sharers, when in fact 'it is
nothing more than right to use someone else's property.'
I had not thought of it that way before.
'Switzerland, which one had imagined buried in cosy isolation in its Alpine
treasure chest, courts the EC having allowed itself to be seduced by the
IMF. The news is no more surprising than the twist taken by the debate at
Westminster on the Maastricht treaty.
Margaret Thatcher may well shriek in her corner, the prime minister John
Major applies with total serenity the signature of his country, up to now
the least 'European' of the Twelve, to the treaty which seals the political
and economic union . . . Exit the archetype of splendid isolation . . . .'
(Patrick Sabatier, under the headline 'The end of received ideas' in
Liberation.)

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Buy and sell on the Bulletin Board -
Diary of a Private Investor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN GOLDSTEIN-JACKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHAT DO the Chepstow Racecourse Company, Hartlepool's Water Company, Hidong
Estate, Inch Kenneth Kajang Rubber, Padang Senang Holdings and Stavert
Zigomala all have in common - apart from me not having shares in any of
them? The answer is that all are included in the stock exchange's new
Bulletin Board service.
Last September, I wrote about my difficulties in trying to buy and sell
shares in a number of companies where turnover was not high, and I suggested
setting up a service where private investors could advertise their
requirements. This, I felt, would help to improve turnover in the shares of
many companies where dealings were few and far between and/or happened only
in very small parcels.
Bulletin Board was introduced on April 27 and it goes a long way towards
meeting my proposal. Around 120 UK-listed and USM company securities are
included in the service, which aims to 'provide a centrally-focused market
creating a more efficient, flexible and low-cost environment in which to
trade. It will also provide for greater market visibility for those
securities for which no continuous two-way prices on SEAQ (stock exchange
automated quotation system) exist.'
The exchange's Topic information system, used by all UK brokers, now has a
special Bulletin Board section on which member firms can display their
purchase or sale requirements for shares in the companies involved. For
example, suppose a private investor, while reassessing his portfolio, finds
a share certificate for a company he had forgotten about, or one in which
shares had been traded in comparatively small numbers only. He can now ask
his broker to see if the company is featured on the Bulletin Board.
If it is, the Topic screen pages will list various details, such as its
approximate free-market capitalisation as a percentage of the shares issued;
the expected dates of announcements of final and interim results; the
after-tax profits; and the volume of shares traded in the previous 12
months. The screen pages will also display details of the past 10 trades
executed in that stock - including the date, price and quantity for each of
them - and it will identify the member firms that were a party to the
trades.
Armed with this information, the investor and his broker can make a decision
more easily about selling an existing holding or increasing it. Either way,
the broker can enter onto the screen either a firm or an indicative order,
or both.
To ensure the system works fairly and efficiently, the stock exchange has
appointed a controller to the Bulletin Board, and all trades using it must
be reported to the controller within three minutes of trading.
There are many other rules and regulations; to make sure brokers are aware
of them, the exchange has issued a 16-page guide for users.
As a private investor, I have for years included holdings in small companies
as a significant part of my share portfolio. The risks are greater but so,
too, can be the rewards. Small companies are, for example, much more likely
to double profits in a year than others the size of, say, GEC.
The Bulletin Board service is still in its infancy but trade is encouraging.
In its first week, 86 securities were advertised, with 78 firm orders and 29
indicative orders. These resulted in 35 actual trades taking place, with a
total value of Pounds 389,302. For the period May 11-15, there were again 86
securities advertised, but there were 45 trades with a total value of Pounds
654,397.
It is important to remember that caution is required: not all the companies
included on the Bulletin Board have shares worth buying. But the stock
exchange is to be congratulated on trying to open up the market and, as the
service becomes more widely known and used, there should be increased
benefits to investors.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Funds head into Europe
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE the House of Commons debated the Maastricht treaty this week, two fund
managers announced that they would plunge into Europe by launching
investment trusts.
Many thought that the time for investment trust launches had finished after
the spate of new issues to take advantage of the personal equity plan rules
at the end of the 1991-92 tax year. But Europe is now established firmly as
the most popular global sector for new investment, thanks to Japan's
difficulties and widespread sentiment that the US market is now overpriced.
Henderson is launching Henderson EuroTrust, which is aiming to raise at
least Pounds 20m. Its portfolio will hold mainly blue chip companies and it
will aim for both growth and income, filling what the company sees as a gap
in its investment trust range. To achieve this, it will have a minimum
holding in bonds of 15 per cent, and can invest up to 10 per cent of its
assets in derivatives. This will allow it cheap exposure to growth stocks.
It will have a split capital structure, with 75 per cent ordinary shares and
25 per cent in zero-dividend preference shares. Zeros are still popular and
this structure will, Henderson hopes, stop the shares from moving to a
discount to net asset value.
The company has a ten-year life until October 2002, when the zero shares
will be redeemed at 70p. This is equivalent to a gross redemption yield of
10.2 per cent. Projected initial gross yield on the ordinary shares is 5 per
cent.
During the launch, only packaged units, consisting of one ordinary share and
one zero at a price of Pounds 1, will be available. Total launch expenses
have been fixed at 4.5 per cent, with an annual management fee of 0.85 per
cent. Gerrard Vivian Gray is sponsoring the issue.
The prospectus will be available on June 8 and applications for personal
equity plans will close on June 22. The offer closes on June 30, with
dealings in the shares starting on July 6.
Thornton Investment Management is, even more ambitiously, seeking to raise
Pounds 100m via an international placing for its European Smaller Companies
trust. Fund management will be conducted jointly by Thornton in the UK,
Banque Nationale de Paris in France and Dresdner Bank in Germany, and
management will be devolved to the three countries. UBS Phillips &amp; Drew is
the sponsor. Thornton hopes that close contact with the markets involved
will help to deliver performance in an area where stock-picking is
particularly important.
It will qualify as a UK investment trust but will also be listed on the
Paris and Frankfurt stock exchanges. Stock will be distributed in Pounds 5
'units' consisting of five ordinary shares and one warrant, and investors
will also be allowed to subscribe in German or French currency at a
'comparable' price.
Peter Walker, the former cabinet minister and chairman of Thornton, said the
fund would aim to take advantage of the establishment of the EC single
market and the reconstruction of eastern Europe.
According to the provisional timetable, the offer for subscription will open
on June 15 and close on July 7, with dealings starting on July 14.

THE TABLE, right, shows capital gains tax allowances for assets sold in
April.
To use it, multiply the original cost of the asset by the figure shown for
the month in which you bought it.
If you subtract the result from the proceeds of your sale, the difference
will be your taxable gain or loss.
Suppose that you bought shares for Pounds 6,000 in February 1985 and sold
them in April 1992 for Pounds 14,000. Multiplying the original cost by the
February 1985 figure of 1.510 gives a total of Pounds 9,060.
Subtracting that from the proceeds of Pounds 14,000 gives a gain for tax
purposes of Pounds 4,940 - which is below the 1992-93 Pounds 5,800 capital
gains tax allowance. If you realised no other gains during the year, the
profit should be tax-free.
If you are selling shares bought before April 6 1982, you should use the
March 1982 figure.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): CGT on two houses
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1980 I bought a property to provide a home for my mother, taking out a
loan of Pounds 12,000. At that time I owned no other property, but in 1984 I
bought a home for myself with a separate mortgage of Pounds 25,000.
Tax legislation allows me a total Pounds 30,000 allowance on the combined
loans, but I am uncertain as to the position of capital gains when, in the
normal occurence of events, I shall have to dispose of my mother's property
on her death. When I took out the loans I understood that no capital gains
would be payable - is this still the case? If not, is there any action you
recommend I should take now?
Provided that your mother has lived in the 1980 property continuously since
March 30 1982, there should be no CGT to pay on a sale of the property
within two (or maybe three) years of the day she moves out, or dies in
residence.
Ask your tax office for the free pamphlet CGT4 (Capital gains tax:
owner-occupied houses); the title is a little misleading.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Root of the problem
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE YEARS ago I made a claim on my insurance for house subsidence. The
insurance experts traced the cause to a large oak tree on adjacent land
owned by a petrol company. This company was asked to cut the tree down but
countered that the cracks were due to faulty construction.
After repair to the house, the insurer paid for a 6ft deep concrete barrier.
The land on the outside of the barrier has subsided, leaving a huge gap.
Fortunately, no further movement has taken place at the wall of my property.
New oaks are growing closer to my fence, and I am worried that these may
overcome the barrier. The gap itself is unsightly, and even if it is filled,
new ones will develop.
I have tried to contact the company to ask it to cut the trees or let me cut
them, but the department managing the land is difficult to contact and, in
view of the original attitude, I expect no action.
Is there something I can do other than taking court action to protect my
property?
Your only recourse would be to seek an injunction to restrain the
continuance of the nuisance caused by the tree roots including, if
necessary, an injunction based on the reasonable apprehension that a
nuisance will arise in the future. The company can be contacted through its
registered office, but unless it proves willing to co-operate, a court order
is the only route to achieve what you require.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family (Briefcase): Wills and times
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MY WIFE and I are thinking of writing our wills. Should we both be involved
in an accident - an air crash - and were both found dead, would one be
presumed to have died before the other? If so, which one? What happens if we
are both involved in the same accident and one dies, and the other is
injured and dies later - would death be presumed to have happened at the
same time as the deceased partner? If not, and the will of the first dead
left all to the second, would this happen as per the will?
Under current legislation where deaths are simultaneous or the sequence is
unknown the younger is deemed to have survived the elder, save that on
intestacy the estate of each falls to be distributed as if the other had not
survived. If it is known that one survived the other, the normal rules of
distribution of estates would apply, ie. the survivor's estate takes any
gift which the will of the first to die (or his or her intestacy) gives to
the survivor.

I OWN THE freehold of the house and would like a friend of mine to have the

am reluctant to convert the house into two flats. Would it be possible to
assign to him tenants-in-common rights to the top floor? This would be for a
sum of money, to be agreed.
You cannot effect a tenancy in common which physically partitions the
property. The interest of each tenant in common has to be in the whole
property.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS MACDONALD, Directus Ltd
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THREE WEEKS ago, we believed it was too simplistic to say directors were
selling just because shares were over-valued. To some extent that still
holds good, but there is some evidence to suggest the recovery in certain
sectors has been more than discounted in present share prices.
One such area is building materials. Directors of Ibstock Johnson, the brick
manufacturer, have been heavy sellers since July last year. The chairman,
Paul Hyde-Thompson, made sales totalling 529,000 shares at prices ranging
from 81-94p.
The selling stopped in December when the share price fell to around 60p, but
recently Hyde-Thompson made another significant disposal. His residual
holding has been reduced to 128,000.
Isotron appears to be one of those companies where the share price is
virtually unaffected by directors' sales. Five directors sold shares
recently, but the previous co-ordinated sales have been shrugged off by the
market.
William Baird, the textile group, has enjoyed a tremendous run since the
announcement of results at the beginning of April. John Jackson has taken
advantage of that rise to sell 513,000 shares at 265p, leaving him with
1.6m.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Be wise about warrants
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOPHISTICATED private investors might be tempted by the world of warrants.
But they should understand the risks.
A warrant is rather like an option - it gives the right to buy shares at a
given price (called the exercise, or strike price) at some future date (or
dates). If the share price rises substantially above the exercise price,
then the warrant-holder can make a substantial profit, either by selling the
warrant in the market or by exercising it and buying the shares at a low
price.
However, if the share price fails to rise above the exercise price, the
warrant will expire worthless. In other words, warrants are highly geared
investments.
Most warrants are issued by companies as a 'sweetener' linked to some other
capital-raising issue. In Japan, for example, many companies issued bonds
with equity warrants attached in the late 1980s. By offering the sweetener,
the company was able to achieve a lower interest rate on the bond issue.
The UK warrant market is small by international standards. James Capel
calculated that, at the end of 1991, the market capitalisation of UK equity
warrants was under Pounds 700m; compared with Dollars 9bn (around Pounds
5bn) in Japan.
One group of companies which has issued warrants is investment trusts, which
use them to get round a new issue problem. Most investment trusts trade at a
discount to their net asset values; thus a new trust has a difficulty - why
should investors pay full value for shares which will quickly drop to a
discount?
By offering a warrant 'for free', trust promoters hope that the value of the
warrant will offset the potential discount and thus persuade investors to
buy shares.
Those who have acquired warrants via a new issue can treat them as a bonus.
But things are different for investors who want to buy them in their own
right.
In some ways, warrants are rather like the capital shares of split level
investment trusts. River &amp; Mercantile's guide to split capital investment
trusts issues a double warning. Warrants will rise faster than capital
shares in rising markets and fall farther in declining markets. In addition,
investment trust warrants can be difficult to buy or sell, and the spread
between buying and selling prices can be large, making dealing costly.
In the non-investment trust world, the most notable warrants are those
issued by four FT-SE 100 companies: BTR, Eurotunnel, Hanson and BP.
Valuing a warrant is a complex process. There are three key components:
Time. The longer it is before the warrant expires, the greater the chance
that exercise will become profitable. Thus the price of the warrant needs to
be higher.
The relationship of the exercise price to the current share price. If a
company's share price is 150p, then a warrant enabling the investor to buy
shares at 100p is obviously worth at least 50p. Such a warrant has
'intrinsic value' and is described as being in-the-money. If the share price
is 80p, then the warrant has no intrinsic value and will be a lot cheaper.
Volatility. The more erratic the company's share price movements, the
greater the chance of warrant exercise being profitable at some point. Hence
a warrant relating to a more volatile share will be more expensive.
The investor must also allow for other factors. Warrant-holders do not
receive the dividends payable to ordinary shareholders; conversely, since a
warrant is less expensive than the underlying share, the cash outlay for
buying a warrant is lower. As a consequence, James Capel says, when interest
rates rise, warrant values should rise; and when dividend yields increase,
warrant values should fall.
All these elements can be bewildering for the private investor, and the
advice of a stockbroker is essential.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Why the Germans fight shy of shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A STORY is circulating in German financial circles about Chancellor Helmut
Kohl's first visit to the Frankfurt Stock Exchange in January this year.
Shortly before he gave a stirring speech to the flower of Germany's business
community, the Chancellor was chatting with Rudiger von Rosen, the
exchange's managing director. The conversation turned to the German people's
reluctance to invest in shares. 'Why is it,' Kohl is reported to have
wondered, 'that we Germans are more than happy to invest in big cars, nice
houses and long holidays - but we never buy any shares?'
Kohl is not alone in being nonplussed at this eccentric aspect of the German
character. Normally patriotic and hard-headed, Germans have denied
themselves the opportunity to invest profitably in their own successful
economy. Germans avoid investing their copious surplus cash in shares and
much prefer buying government securities - 'even though they know they will
make much more money owning shares rather than bonds', as von Rosen puts it.
As a measure of this, the value of Germans' investments in bond funds was
DM102bn last year - a five-fold increase since the beginning of the 1980s.
The comparable figure for equity unit trusts was DM20bn, not much more than
double the DM8bn it was ten years ago.
This is in spite of the fact that the average gross annual return on bonds
was 8 per cent a year during the 1980s, compared with 14 per cent for
equities. DM10,000 (Pounds 3,400) invested in the DAX index of 30 leading
shares at the beginning of the 1980s would now be worth DM33,400 (Pounds
11,360). If the same amount of money were invested in Bunds, it would now be
worth DM21,600 (Pounds 7,347). The net return for equities was even higher,
as investors do not have to pay capital gains tax on equities if they hold
them for more than six months.
In total, there are only about 4.2m shareholders in Germany - just over 5
per cent of the population - compared with 12m shareholders in the UK and
51m in the US - 21 per cent of the population in both cases.
So why are Germans so shy of buying shares? Here are a few reasons for the
lack of an equity culture in Germany:
An aversion to the rough-and-tumble of the equity markets - and by extension
to speculation and financial excesses of any kind - is deeply ingrained in
the German psyche, probably due to folk memories of the great inflations of
the 1920s and the political consequences.
'Germans are not . . . at ease with the equity market,' says Christian
Strenger, until recently with the Deutsche Bank in New York and now head of
the Frankfurt-based Deutsche Gesellschaft fur Wertpapiersparen, Europe's
largest retail fund manager, with DM50bn under management. 'They like it
when it goes up but their tolerance level is low when it goes down.
'If someone in the US buys a share and it doesn't work out, he says to
himself, 'OK, too bad.' He sells the stock at a loss and makes a new
investment. Here people sit and suffer. They hate to lose and are not very
mobile when compared with US investors.'
The concept of 'shareholder value' - of managing a business for the benefit
of shareholders - is rare. German law requires that managers put the
interests of the 'company' - difficult to define - ahead of those of other
parties. It is against the law to put the shareholder first.
Hostile takeovers are virtually unheard of. Management performance is never
subjected to the judgment of the market - unlike in the UK or the US where
managers live in constant fear of being dislodged by a bidder if they do not
deliver. German managers have no great incentive to raise share prices, and
shareholders can never benefit from takeovers.
The German stock market plays a limited role in German corporate life. Only
about 660 companies have a listing and all but around 50 of these are
controlled by family shareholders or the big German banks and insurance
companies. Companies rarely turn to the stock market for funds, relying on
their commercial banking relationships instead.
Domestic institutional investment in equities - from pension funds and
insurance companies - is not well developed. For example, Germany's colossal
insurance companies have an average of between 5 and 15 per cent of their
reserves invested in shares, and the rest in government bonds. This is the
opposite of the situation in the UK and US and hinders the development of
liquid equity markets.
Germans have been put off buying equities as a result of a spate of insider
dealing cases and other murky goings-on in the Frankfurt stock market (the
biggest by far of Germany's six exchanges) last year.
Partly as a response to last year's scandals, the German financial
establishment has embarked on a big 'clean-up.' Insider dealing is to become
illegal (it is not at the moment) and a tough new regulatory regime is
planned for the end of the year.
These initiatives are targeted primarily at international institutional
investors and are designed to make Frankfurt more competitive with London as
a financial centre. However, they are also likely to attract private
individuals back to the market.
In the short term, Germans are likely to shun equities and continue
investing in holidays, big cars, bonds - and bank accounts. German interest
rates are at historically high levels and German investors prefer to take no
risks - they just leave their money in the bank.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Opportunity knocks across the Channel
 -Investing in . . . France
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT MAY just be British prejudice, but few people seem interested in the
investment opportunities available just across the Channel.
Germany has been regarded as the leader of European economies for years now,
while France seems merely to move in its slipstream. Also, the French market
has relatively few quoted stocks, and is far less liquid than London - to
the extent that the stock market generally receives a boost in January and
February, when the coupons on government bonds are paid.
Despite having its own Big Bang, the impression is that the Paris bourse is
dominated by a small number of firms, even though brokers say that trading
is generally cheaper in Paris than it is in London.
Add to this the traditional British friction with all things French, and the
limited range of opportunities for UK investors to gain exposure
specifically to France is scarcely surprising. Only two authorised UK unit
trusts invest exclusively in France, although there is a range of insurance
and pension funds and a few Luxembourg-based funds.
However, if you choose to invest in a European fund, you may find that you
are in fact investing very heavily in France. Most UK fund managers are now
heavily overweight in this market.
Henderson is launching a European investment trust next month with an
initial asset allocation including 23 per cent in France, compared with only
14 per cent in Germany. Its managers point to the current political optimism
and the intention of several big French pension funds to increase their
equity holdings.
There is also a belief that the economic balance of power between France and
Germany could change. The Continent is awash with speculation that the Franc
could replace the D-Mark as the anchor for the European monetary system.
This may be premature, but it speaks volumes for the shift in sentiment.
Germany's problems are well-documented and have much to do with the
resurgence of optimism about France. But few appreciate that France has
avoided the worst of Germany's difficulties. France's political
embarrassments over the last year, with the fall and rise of Edith Cresson
and the near-breakthrough of Jean-Marie Le Pen and the far right, have
obscured the enviable price stability over the same period.
Inflation - at 3 per cent and forecast by many to fall further - seems to be
'licked', as John Major might put it. The main banks' base rates, at 9.85
per cent, remain almost artificially high thanks to the neighbouring
influence of Germany.
The markets have also received the appointment of prime minister Pierre
Beregovoy, a former finance minister, with delight. He has instilled new
confidence in the markets, is trusted to be 'responsible', and any fiscal
stimulus he does administer, to help the Socialist re-election effort, is
likely to benefit the markets.
All this might lead you to think that the time to buy has passed. Certainly,
the performance of the French stock market over the last year has been
impressive - the benchmark CAC-40 index is up 10.78 per cent over a year.
Meanwhile, the performance figures of UK funds investing in the area look
very respectable. INVESCO French Growth, the longest established unit trust
investing exclusively in France, leads the European sector over a year with
growth of 13.88 per cent. Over three years it is 13th, with 24.89 per cent
growth. Le Fond Francais, now owned by Providence Capitol and managed by
Wargny, the long-established French broker, has grown 16 per cent this year.
It sounds as though a lot of good news is already in French prices. However,
optimism among fund managers remains high. Interest rates have much to do
with this. Real interest rates (compared with inflation) of more than 6 per
cent are rare, and suggest that there is scope for substantial fiscal
easing. This ought to be good news for equities, and also for strong capital
growth in bonds.
Not only will companies be more free to raise finance. At present about
FFr1,000bn is tied up in cash mutual funds, thanks to the attractive rates
offered. This is roughly half the total capitalisation of the stock market.
Once money market rates fall, analysts expect a significant flow of funds
into equities, which will act as a stimulus.
Yet more liquidity could come from a projected new tax relief for small
savers, the Plan D'Epargne Actions (PEA), which would offer hefty
concessions on equity investments provided they were held for at least six
years. Jean Legros, of Mercury, thinks this could have a big impact on the
market although other managers, such as Rory Powell of Invesco MIM, are more
cautious.
The US economy is another important factor. Many of the largest French
companies have heavy exposure to American markets. So their corporate
earnings should receive a significant boost when - and if - American
consumers start buying again.
Many forecasts for corporate earnings are bullish - Invesco is predicting
growth of 'at least 15 per cent, possible closer to 20 per cent, for the
next year. If this is right, then market valuations are attractive, in spite
of the market's relatively low yield and recent price rises. And given the
current lamentably high level of unemployment - more than 9 per cent - the
room for growth is evident.
So, in which sectors are managers investing? Legros has aimed for cyclicals
and companies with heavy exposure to the US. That includes Michelin, the
largest tyre manufacturer in the world, which is ideally placed for a
pick-up in the US, and Rhone-Poulenc, a consumer credit company, which would
leap on any base rate cut as an opportunity to increase margins.
Powell is adopting an almost identical strategy for Invesco, concentrating
on US-exposure stocks, cyclicals, and companies which can benefit from
rationalisation. Powell is also heavily invested in Michelin and
Rhone-Poulenc, but also in St. Gobain, which is well-placed to benefit from
a revival in the US construction industry. He has now started to move into
medium-sized and smaller companies.
So, it might be time for a does of extended entente cordiale. As the current
spate of investment trusts demonstrates, UK managers seem finally to be
aware of the opportunities available across the Channel.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Budget points enacted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Finance Bill (number 2), enacting many of the proposals put forward in
the Budget by Norman Lamont, was published this week.
Most Budget measures have already gone through, either as a result of
Treasury Orders or the pre-election Finance Act, which was given Royal
Assent on March 16. That enacted the new 20 per cent income tax rate on the
first Pounds 2,000 of taxable income. The new Bill deals with those measures
which the government did not have time to pass through the Commons before
the election.
These measures include:
Inheritance tax. Lamont raised the threshold to Pounds 147,000 from Pounds
140,000 on April 6, in line with inflation. However, he wanted to increase
the tax benefits over and above inflation to Pounds 150,000. The Pounds
147,000 threshold took effect from April 6; provision for the remaining
Pounds 3,000 increase is now included in the Bill.
Lamont also proposed the exclusion of certain business assets and farmland
from IHT. They include businesses owned by a sole trader, partnership shares
and large minority shareholdings in unquoted trading companies. The measure
will take retrospective effect from March 10 if the Bill passes through
parliament.
Married Couple's Allowance. This allowance, which has not been raised from
its pre-Budget level of Pounds 1,720, is paid to the husband in the vast
majority of circumstances. Lamont proposed that married couples should be
allowed a choice in the manner in which it should be allocated. Wives can
opt to have it paid in its entirety to them, or it can be split. If no
action is taken, it will go to the husband. This is an uncontroversial
clause and the Finance Bill sets out the arrangements with effect from April
6 1993.
Gift Aid. Those wanting to give to charity under the Gift Aid scheme qualify
for tax relief if a minimum of Pounds 600 is given. Lamont proposed reducing
the minimum limit to Pounds 400 - a measure now registered in the Finance
Bill and which should come into effect from July 1. Gifts would be treated
as net of basic rate tax. A top rate taxpayer giving Pounds 400 could
reclaim the 15 per cent difference (Pounds 79.99) between basic and top
rates. The charity could claim tax relief at 25 per cent (Pounds 133.33).
So, Gift Aid enables a top-rate taxpayer to give Pounds 533.33 to charity
for a net outlay of Pounds 320.01.
Business Expansion Scheme. The chancellor proposed ending tax relief under
the BES with effect from the end of 1993. Under the BES, you could invest a
maximum of Pounds 40,000 to receive a rebate of 40 per cent of the amount
invested as long as this was maintained for five years.

A FIRST profit contribution from the US should help Body Shop International,
the eco-friendly retailer of beauty products, to a 25 per cent-plus increase
in pre-tax profits. A figure of Pounds 25m to Pounds 26m is expected when
the full-year results are announced on Wednesday. With UK growth limited by
recession, the turnround in the relatively new US chain will be a critical
factor alongside continued progress on the continent.
Carlton Communications, the television and television services group, is
expected to announce a modest increase in interim pre-tax profits on
Wednesday. Analysts are predicting around Pounds 48m, which suggests that
Carlton has still been suffering from recession. The Pounds 46.3m figure
last year was nearly 30 per cent down on 1990.
When MEPC, the UK's second largest property company, reports its interim
results on Thursday, attention will be focused on its development programme,
which is the largest in the sector.
Analysts will be particularly keen to hear of any progress in letting Alban
Gate, the largely-empty office block straddling London Wall in the City. The
pre-tax profits for the half year to March 1992 are expected to be around
Pounds 63m, down from Pounds 67.4m a year ago. Although the rental income is
likely to rise, this will be offset by an increase in financing costs as the
company reduces the proportion of capitalised interest associated with
development properties.
On the same day, Thorn EMI is expected to report annual pre-tax profits
slightly down from last time's Pounds 258.6m to about Pounds 255m, although
they could fall as low as Pounds 240m. Recent acquisitions - the half of
Chrysalis Records which Thorn did not already own, Remco America, and Virgin
Music Group, this latter only acquired at the beginning of March - will
probably have boosted the pre-tax line, though earnings are likely to be
down around 10 per cent.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: How to find a fee-charging financial
adviser
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HOW DO you find a fee-charging financial adviser when you need one? Few
advertise their services too strenuously, for sound commercial reasons.
'Come to us for advice and we'll ask you for money, even if you don't buy
anything,' would not be a good sales pitch.
As yet, there are few advisers who operate solely on a fee basis, but the
number prepared to offer this option is growing fast. The names of 1,500
prepared to charge fees are available in a register - arguably the best
available - published by Money Management magazine and administered by
Professional Life, but many 'swing both ways' and do the bulk of their
business through commission.
Money Management takes no responsibility for the advisers on its list. But
if you consult one and find the standard offered is unacceptable, report
this and the adviser will be knocked off the register. The magazine will
send you details of six advisers near you, and it is worth investigating all
of them.
Send your enquiry to: Money Management Fee-Based Adviser Register, Financial
Times Business Information, Greystoke Place, Fetter Lane, London EC4A 1ND.
Remember to include your postcode, since this is used to locate the nearest
firms of advisers in your area.
The Institute of Financial Planning is attempting a slightly more ambitious
project. Its registry of financial planning practitioners will include all
those who have passed the IFP's examinations on financial planning, and who
will abide by its code of practice. This includes offering a financial
planning service separate from any investment business, if required.
The registry is still being compiled, and is likely to have a rather smaller
list of members than the Money Management list, but it will aim to include
all those satisfying the IFP criteria who charge fees. Details are available
on 0432-274-8991.
The IFP is, however, an embryonic professional body. If you specifically
need the services of an accountant, a longer-established organisation can
help.
The Institute of Chartered Accountants (head office: 071-606-7060) is
divided into 22 regional offices. Your local branch will be able to provide
the names of the firms nearest to you. Again, it is wise to check all of
them; most will give basic details of fees and services without charge.
The Law Society (head office: 071-242-1222) offers a similar service and
publishes the Solicitors' Regional Directory, available in all public
libraries and citizens' advice bureaux. This gives details of all qualified
solicitors in your region and their special fields and should guide you
quickly to those suited best to will-writing or estate-planning. The
complete register is available at the Law Society's shop in the Strand,
London.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Finance &amp; The Family: Financial advice: beware the hidden
strings - 'Independent' advisers may not be all they seem. Remuneration by
commission can cost an investor dear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LOOK through the contract note for an investment product and you will find a
revealing little phrase.
Typically, it goes like this: 'The adviser who sold you this product is an
employee of XYZ Services, and has been remunerated by us.'
Few people think of their advisers as being the employee of someone else -
particularly if that adviser is 'independent'. But if you are accepting
advice from someone who is paid by commission from the product provider,
rather than by a fee from you, then that adviser is not employed by you at
all. If there is any logic to remuneration, then he owes his loyalty to the
company.
Looked at this way, it seems startling that anyone accepts advice from a
commission-charging adviser. However, the British aversion to writing a
cheque to a mere 'intermediary', coupled with a reluctance to make financial
plans, has ensured that the bulk of investment products have been sold via
the commission system. British consumers have the intermediary system they
deserve.
Some products, such as National Savings and gilts, do not pay any commission
and are often overlooked. Unit trusts, appropriate for many, do pay
commission, but at 3 per cent they cannot match the commission on similar
life insurance company bonds.
A commission-charging IFA therefore needs to be most philanthropic before he
will steer a client towards one of these products. He has a strong incentive
not to do so.
Cost is also an issue. Fee-charging advice is not necessarily an expensive
luxury - it can work out much cheaper for the consumer than commissions
would be.
Commission is usually charged as a percentage of the total investment, which
gives the salesman an incentive to encourage you to invest a large sum.
Insurance companies prefer investors to pay small sums of money regularly,
so monthly premium contracts are particularly expensive.
For example, a survey earlier this year by Lautro found that the average
commission paid for a 25-year mortgage-linked endowment policy with a
premium of Pounds 50 per month was Pounds 498, if bought through an
independent financial adviser, and Pounds 570 if bought via a tied agent.
The highest commission was Pounds 641 - more than a year's premiums.
Compare this with fee-charging advisers. At Chamberlain De Broe, a
London-based broker, there is a flat fee of Pounds 14 for buying a
guaranteed income bond, Pounds 50 for buying a unit trust, and then from
Pounds 50 to Pounds 150 for buying a pension or an insurance product.
A survey by the Institute of Financial Planning, a small professional body
which covers the sector, found that the average fee per hour charged by
fee-charging members was Pounds 80, while more than a third charged less
than Pounds 75. Buying an endowment, a mainstream product which most offices
will be well-geared to sell, is unlikely to take more than two hours' work.
Commission thus begins to look like a wholesale scandal. But it is not fair
to heap opprobrium on the UK's financial advisers just for accepting
commission. Most of them are only reacting to the fact that consumers have
not been prepared to pay fees. However, a trend towards fee-charging advice
has now emerged, fuelled by new, low commission products and greater
disposable wealth. People today have a greater understanding of finance and
are happy to pay for advice.
But moves in this direction have encountered roadblocks which should be
dismantled.
Two life offices are wholly non-commission paying - Professional Life,
established in 1990, and Provident Life, which opted to restructure its
operation to aim at non-commission charging advisers after a survey by
McKinsey, the management consultants, had suggested that this was the way
forward for the industry.
The attitudes of other offices vary. It need not matter to them how
intermediaries are paid, but the difficulty of adapting computers to cut out
commissions can stop them.
Awkward facts can also be revealed by the practise some fee-charging
advisers have of rebating commission to consumers. By rebating commissions
on some with-profits bonds, advisers gave customers an instant 2 per cent
profit, which provided a strong stimulus to surrender early - the life
offices were not amused.
Tax is a problem when commission is paid and then rebated. Commission is
paid as an income to the intermediary, who then has to pay income tax on it.
If it is then passed to the consumer, the income tax liability goes with it.
VAT is payable on fees, which adds to the difficulties the tax authorities
put in the way of fee-charging.
Another problem is that non-commission products need not be the cheapest if
their costs incorporate heavy payments to their own sales force.
For example, fee-chargers direct much ire at Equitable Life, easily the most
successful office which does not pay commissions to intermediaries, because
charges are deducted even if the investor approaches the company direct.
According to Pensionline, a fee-charging pension service, Equitable has the
lowest charges, including commission, on 25-year unit-linked regular premium
personal pensions - these charges account for 16.97 per cent of the final
fund. However, with commission rebated, Scottish Life's charges are only
11.18 per cent, and 13 other offices also undercut Equitable. The issues are
complex.
There is no homogenous profession of 'fee-charging advisers'. People who
answer to this description include accountants, solicitors, stockbrokers,
benefits consultants, consulting actuaries, and a wide range of more
traditional independent advisers with hybrid methods of charging fees.
It is vital not to end up paying more than you would via a straight
commission, and to understand exactly what you are paying for.
Jim Roberts, general manager of Professional Life, outlines some of the
options: Hourly Rate. This would be most financial advisers' ideal. But
people still have an aversion to coming in off the street and paying money
to be told not to do something.
Thus, many advisers will offer you a free first hour of consultation and
provide an estimate of the work to be done, and its likely cost, at the end
of it.
Annual Fees. Clients effectively pay a 'membership' fee, and in return
receive sustained advice including an annual meeting and regular reports.
Further action, however, would cost extra money. This may be more the kind
of over-arching 'service' which those who are less financially
self-confident will need, but it can work out more expensively.
Investment or Portfolio Charges. This makes a step back to the world of
incentives offered by commission, but there is no conflict of interest
between adviser and client. The adviser wants to make the portfolio grow, as
this will increase the amount he is allowed to take in fees.
Most fee-chargers end up using a combination and in some cases admit that
they only become substantially cheaper than commission-based advisers for
high amounts. David Kauders, who changed his business from 99 per cent
commission to 98 per cent fees in four years, charges on three different
bases: a transaction tariff; an hourly time charge; and a portfolio
management charge.
Some commission-based advisers offer 'hybrid' products to make the
commission transparent. Hargreaves Lansdown offers the Savers' Association,
which in return for a fee keeps customers informed of best building society,
National Savings and bonds rates. The company has spiced the offer with
holiday discounts to overcome the dislike of fees.
Baronworth Investment Services always rebates at least 50 per cent of
commission to customers. For some products, or negotiated large deals, it
will often rebate more.
Baronworth is prepared to grit its teeth and buy non-commission products -
from companies such as Equitable Life or Acuma - without charging a fee. As
Colin Jackson, its managing director, says: 'We'll perform the service for
them, and hope they come back. We're casting our bread upon the waters.'

FT  23 MAY 92 / Markets: Summertime, and the market is easing - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SUMMER officially opens in the US this weekend with the Memorial Day
holiday, but stock watchers on Wall Street are not approaching the new
season with much enthusiasm.
The omens for the coming months are not encouraging. The Dow has been
flirting with 3,400 for more than a week, yet every time it passes that
particular milestone investors sell enough stocks to send the index back
where it came from.
The selling reflects the widespread view among investors that 3,400 is too
high for the Dow, and that the market is overvalued in terms of both
corporate earnings and the outlook for the economy.
The broader indices, meanwhile, continue to lag behind the Dow, confirming
that confidence in the market is thinly spread. Trading volume is also
falling off. Throughout April 200m-share days were common. Since the start
of May, however, the market has not breached the 200m-share mark, and daily
turnover has averaged nearer 160m to 170m shares.
At the same time, equity markets have been unnerved by rising long-term
interest rates. Yields on the 30-year bond refuse to come down much below 8
per cent, which is worrying stock investors who fear high interest rates
will stifle any recovery in the vitally important residential housing
market.
Mortgages in the US are priced off Treasury bond yields, and when they
remain high, potential homebuyers are discouraged from borrowing to purchase
new homes. There were signs this week that the recovery in the housing
market may already be in trouble. The government reported a 17 per cent drop
in housing starts for April, a decline that stunned analysts, who had
expected only a minor setback.
Although the tumble in housing starts sparked a brief bond market rally, the
dominant influence among Treasury investors this week has been monetary
policy, and the worrying absence of an easing by the Federal Reserve.
Hopes of another interest rate cut had been high, with analysts'
increasingly confident that the Fed would react to slow money growth and a
weak labour market with a final rate reduction.
Those hopes were dealt a serious blow on Thursday, however, when reports
from Washington DC suggested that the policy-making Fed's Open Market
Committee (FOMC) had voted at its get-together on Tuesday to keep monetary
policy unchanged and to drop its bias toward easing for at least one month.
Although the FOMC's decision does not rule out another rate cut entirely -
the Fed chairman can order a   1/4 point cut in the Fed funds rate whenever
he feels economic conditions require it - the vote against easing suggests
the monetary authorities are satisfied with the way the economic recovery is
advancing, and see no need for further stimulus.
The FOMC vote, therefore, may have kicked away the last prop holding the
stock market and the Dow up at 3,400. If investors cannot look forward to
another interest rate cut soon, and if economic growth and corporate
earnings continue to maintain steady but unspectacular progress for the next
three to six months, then there the chance of equities making much headway
over the summer is remote.
Supply pressures are also squeezing the stock market. Only this week a
whopping Dollars 2.6bn in new stock was sold to investors, eating into the
market's already dwindling stockpile of cash. The bulk of the new shares
came from General Motors, which, in the biggest public common stock issue in
US corporate history, sold 55m shares at Dollars 39 each on Tuesday in an
effort to bolster its sagging balance sheet. The remaining Dollars 450m or
so was poured into the coffers of Federated Department Stores, which sold
40m shares at Dollars 11.50 each.
The success of the GM issue, upped by 5m shares at the last minute because
of strong demand, was a boost to market sentiment. The company is not the
force it once was, but the old adage that what is good for GM is good for
America still has some relevance, and it was important that US investors
(and some from overseas) displayed their confidence in GM by putting up the
cash for the giant carmaker.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Markets: Argyll mixes it with the big boys - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR Alistair Grant, chairman of Argyll Group, which runs the Safeway, Presto
and Lo-Cost grocery chains, once likened his company's directors to a group
of small boys in shorts playing football at the far end of the schoolyard.
'Now we are up mixing it with the big boys,' he says proudly.
In the five years since it bought the Safeway chain of supermarkets, Argyll
has indeed grown to maturity and is widely recognised as being among the
'big three' of the grocery trade - some way short of, but at least in touch,
with J. Sainsbury and Tesco.
This week Argyll confirmed its strength by producing a 25 per cent
improvement in pre-tax profits to Pounds 364.5m in the middle of a recession
and in the face of intense competition.
Spending on food has been little affected by the economic downturn, but the
pace of Argyll's physical growth and profits expansion has nevertheless been
eye-catching.
Last year it opened 17 Safeway stores, accounting for most of its capital
expenditure budget of Pounds 442m. And Safeway is stepping up its
development programme by opening 25 stores both this year and next.
Still flush with funds from last June's Pounds 387m rights issue, Argyll
will invest a further Pounds 550m this year, which works out at almost
Pounds 1 1/2 m a day. Its new stores, costing about Pounds 15m, are
achieving a return on investment of 30 per cent.
The 322-store Safeway chain accounts for about three-quarters of the group's
turnover of Pounds 5.04bn. In the past five years its profits have grown
sixfold and sales threefold.
Safeway has been transformed since it was acquired. Five years ago, most of
its store portfolio consisted of 1970s American-style supermarkets which
were losing their edge against the out-of-town superstores being erected by
their rivals.
But Argyll has strongly developed the Safeway brand moving into edge-of-town
superstore sites, expanding the company's own-label range, investing heavily
in electronic point of sale (epos) systems, and creating a centralised
distribution network.
In 1987 the company scanned only 2 per cent of its goods through epos
systems. Now it scans 100 per cent, giving the company enormous marketing
and operational benefits.
Argyll is also a marketing company. This year it will launch 1,500 own-label
lines which will enable it to edge margins still higher. 'We now have more
in common with Unilever than with Jack Cohen's style of 'piling it high
selling it cheap' in the early days of Tesco,' says Grant.
David Webster, deputy chairman, points out that Safeway has broadened its
range of activities and runs 317 delicatessens, 275 bakeries, 31 petrol
stations, and 53 pharmacies.
Argyll also owns the Presto chain, which has 212 supermarkets, and Lo-Cost,
which runs 285 discount outlets.
In recent years, these two businesses have taken the back seat to Safeway's
development plans. But Argyll's directors hinted this week that they may
push these brands far more aggressively as the exceptional returns achieved
from the big edge-of-town Safeway superstores begin to tail off.
Argyll has kept a close eye on developments in the mainland European food
retailing market by linking up with Ahold of the Netherlands and Casino of
France to form the European Retail Alliance (Era). This group swaps
technology skills and distribution expertise and is beginning to pool buying
power.
The link is already being seen in some of Safeway's stores. Shoppers at the
recently-opened Hatch End store have been treated to a range of 50
Casino-sourced French products, such as cassoulet and creme dessert.
But in spite of its progress, Argyll will always remain one of the great
'what if?' stories of UK corporate history.
Would Argyll have performed still better had James Gulliver won the
controversial contested auction for the Distillers drinks group in 1986 and
been able to take advantage of the great profits uplift that Guinness has
enjoyed?
Nobody can know for sure. But Argyll seems quite happy spending the Pounds
100m proceeds it received from Guinness in settlement of its legal claim
building several more highly profitable superstores.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Markets: Ups and downs of inflation - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP COGGAN, Personal Finance Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EVERYONE would agree that inflation is a 'bad thing'. Unfortunately, it is
much less easy to agree on what the inflation rate actually is. This week,
Norman Lamont, the UK chancellor, asked for a review of the way that housing
costs are treated within the Retail Prices Index.
Now, the cynic would assume that any change in a government statistic must
be bad news for the public. And certainly, it was only in 1990 that
government ministers were arguing that we should concentrate on the
'underlying' rate of inflation, and not the headline RPI rate.
But there is a respectable intellectual case for changing the system. When
the government causes interest rates to increase, it normally does so to
control inflation. But the inclusion of mortgage payments within the RPI
means that an interest rate increase causes the index to rise.
Since many wage bargainers use the RPI as the basis for pay negotiations,
the result is that the government's chosen definition of 'headline'
inflation can cause underlying inflation to rise even faster.
Furthermore, most other countries do not include mortgage rates in their
inflation indices. So the present system makes our position look worse than
that of our competitors.
Hang on, you might reasonably interject. Any inflation index is supposed to
measure the cost of living. If I have a mortgage, and the interest rate
increases, my cost of living has risen. Taking the mortgage rate out of the
RPI defies common sense.
Nevertheless, the critics retort, not everyone has a mortgage. Some people
rent; others own their homes outright. A different measure of housing costs
(such as imputed rent - the rent an occupant would pay if he did not own the
property) might be a more realistic guide to 'true' inflation.
This might seem an arcane economic debate, but the rate of inflation is very
important to the modern economy. Many social security benefits, occupational
pensions and utility prices are tied to the RPI. And investors buy
RPI-linked gilts and National Savings, to protect themselves against the
effects of rising prices on their savings. There thus might be a lot of
winners and losers from a sudden change in the composition of the index.
At present, recent declines in interest rates mean that the measure of
inflation which excludes mortgage rates is higher than the RPI (the April
yearly rates were 5.7 per cent and 4.3 per cent respectively). So a change
in the calculation of the RPI might be good for those who rely on
index-linked benefits or investments for income.
By the time the review of the index is completed, things could have changed.
The UK could be at a different stage of the interest rate cycle.
Those who own index-linked gilts and National Savings might feel that they
ought to have some protection from the effects of statistical manipulation.
After all, how far could the process go? Could the government start
excluding the effect of, say, excise duties or VAT in an attempt to keep the
RPI at an artificially low level?
In the case of National Savings, the answer is: tough luck. The value of
certificates will rise in line with the RPI, however the government deems it
to be constituted.
Gilts are different. The issue prospectus refers to a change in the basic
calculation of the RPI which 'in the opinion of the Bank of England,
constitutes a fundamental change in the index which would be materially
detrimental to the interests of stockholders.' Such a change, the prospectus
continues, would result in investors being given the right to redeem their
gilts.
There was a jump in the price of index-linked gilts this week as investors
speculated that this clause might be triggered. Index-linked gilts trade
below their indexed value and thus redemption would be highly profitable for
investors.
But Simon Briscoe, gilts analyst at Greenwell Montagu, thinks this unlikely.
First, he argues that if mortgage rates are replaced in the index by some
other measure of housing costs - such as imputed rent - the change would not
be regarded as fundamental.
Second, he argues that the change would not be 'materially detrimental'.
'Over the long run, there would be negligible difference between inflation
judged by an index that includes mortgages and one that excluded them, as
interest rates tend to fluctuate around a certain level' says Briscoe.
In other words, periods when the headline rate of RPI is above the rate
excluding mortgages (as in 1990) are cancelled out by periods when the
reverse is the case (as now).
So those who have bought index-linked gilts cannot expect a sudden profit.
On the other hand, the logic of the Briscoe argument is that index-linked
investors need not worry too much about a change in the index.
Indeed, recent changes in National Savings rates may have made index-linked
more attractive. The 37th issue pays 8 per cent; since the 5th index-linked
issue pays 4.5 per cent over the rise in the RPI, inflation would only have
to average more than 3.5 per cent to beat this return. The days of 10 per
cent inflation may have gone for a while. But, given the UK's economic
record, it is surely not a wild gamble to assume that inflation might be
above 3.5 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Scottish Provident has launched a with-profits bond. It aims to avoid the
biggest drawback of these bonds, which is the freedom which offices allow
themselves to make downward 'market value adjustments' if market conditions
are bad when an investor encashes the bond.
Scottish Provident has guaranteed not to apply an MVA in any of the
following circumstances: on the death of the bondholder, or when drawing an
income of 7.5 per cent or less, or when withdrawing money on the fifth
anniversary of the bond. This also applies on each subsequent fifth
anniversary.
The rates being offered are slightly lower than those elsewhere. There is a
guaranteed bonus of 3 per cent annually, with a reversionary bonus on top,
currently 6.25 per cent, making a growth rate of 9.25 per cent. The
bid/offer spread is 5 per cent.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of growing press criticism, sales of life insurance products rose
substantially in the first quarter of this year, according to figures
published yesterday by the Association of British Insurers. Single premium
business - which often increases during a recession as consumers look to
invest redundancy payments - rose by 85 per cent compared with the same
period last year.
Much of this was due to the continued popularity with-profits bonds - sales
increased by 156 per cent. Doubts remain about the validity of the sales
techniques used in promoting these products and Lautro, the industry's
regulator, has launched an inquiry into them. Annuity business increased by
32 per cent and single premium pensions by 51 per cent. Total new annual
premium business rose by 4 per cent.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Markets: Looking beyond the gloom - London Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARTIN, Financial Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT SOMETIMES seems as though the stock market has been waiting for economic
recovery so long that it will not know what to do when it arrives. This
week, however, came the first signs of adjustment to life after recession.
Norman Lamont and the Bank of England both started to look past the question
of what economic policy would end the recession soonest, to the policy that
would best ensure stable medium term growth.
The chancellor focused, in a speech to the Confederation of British Industry
on Tuesday, on the need to halve British inflation to match Japan's 2 per
cent rate. Entry into the Exchange Rate Mechanism required a 'sea change in
attitudes to inflation in Britain,' he said.
Similar noises came from the Bank of England the same day, which was also
marked by government figures reporting a 0.3 per cent increase in
manufacturing output in the first quarter of the year, the first rise in 18
months.
Like the chancellor, the Bank wants to see further progress on inflation.
Its principal concern, however, is government spending, which, it says,
threatens Britain's ability to meet the Maastricht terms for entry to
European Monetary Union later in the decade.
All this official sternness had no immediate impact on gilts, the market
most sensitive to concerns about inflation and government borrowing. But on
Wednesday, the authorities' message about a slow, non-inflationary recovery
was reinforced by weak retail sales numbers. Gilts bounced upwards.
Longer-dated government bonds - which would benefit most from a permanently
lower level of inflation - did best, with yields dropping below 9 per cent.
By Friday, long-term interest rates were a quarter of a point lower than a
month ago, with much of the change traceable to the past week.
As a result, the gap between interest rates on gilts and on German bunds has
also narrowed: this Friday it was 1.18 percentage points, the slimmest it
has been in recent months and much less than the 2.30 point gap in the depth
of pre-election gloom. S G Warburg is predicting a further drop to between
0.75 and 1.00 per cent in a year's time.
A pointer to the gilt market's strong performance could perhaps have been
seen in Smith New Court's survey of institutional investors, carried out by
Gallup on May 11-12 and issued on Monday. Fund managers' buying plans for
gilts were the most positive since monthly surveys began two years ago.
Investors were adjusting to life after recession in other ways, the survey
suggested. The balance of fund managers planning to increase their holdings
of UK equities dropped back in May, in line with levels earlier in the year
but well below those seen in April's post-election euphoria. As the chart
shows, movements in buying intentions appear to translate into movements in
the FT-SE Index, with a lag of a month or so. If that pattern continues, the
weakening of buying intentions may mean that the FT-SE's retreat from its
post-election high has further to go. In spite of this, it managed to
recover some of last week's losses, closing on Friday at 2,715.0, up 32.4 on
the week.
One possible sustaining influence, noticeable in the survey, is that
underlying expectations for UK equities improved last month. Fund managers
are now expecting the FT-SE Index to reach 3,024 a year hence, the first
time the 12-month forecast has gone over 3,000.
At a more mundane level, the food retailing sector was also starting to look
ahead. The strong performance of the sector during the recession seemed no
longer enough for investors. Argyll reported a 25 per cent rise in pre-tax
profits on Wednesday, but its shares fell 10p on the day as shareholders
worried about current trading.
Another setback for the supermarket chains came on Thursday, as Morrison,
the Yorkshire group, announced it would begin depreciating the value of its
sites. Shares of all the leading groups suffered; Tesco did worst, losing
26p to finish at 267p.
On Thursday, Sir Leon Brittan announced that the EC Commission saw no
competition objections to the bid for Midland Bank by Hongkong and Shanghai
Banking Corporation. On Friday, Michael Heseltine announced that the
Department of Trade and Industry was referring the Lloyds bid for Midland to
the Monopolies and Mergers Commission.
There was nothing unexpected in either decision, but the market took them as
good auguries for the Hongkong bid. Midland shares closed the week at 405p,
up 11p, and Lloyds at 427p, down 2p.
That was not the only news affecting bank shares this week. As Hongkong Bank
came a step closer to one of the first big cross-border banking takeovers of
the 1990s, Barclays was escaping the unhappy consequences of a similar,
rather smaller, purchase of earlier decades.
It announced the sale - for what seemed a trifling sum - of its 65-branch
New York retail banking operations. Barclays closed the week at 392p, up
18p.
Overseas misfortune dogged another bank. In Bombay this week, the stock
exchange scandal there claimed Standard Chartered as a victim. The bank
announced a provision of Pounds 50m for what might turn out to be forged
bank promissory notes it is holding at its Bombay branch. The Pounds 50m
provision was pretty much a guess, the bank said, but its losses were
'unlikely' to be more than Pounds 100m.
Standard's long suffering shareholders took the news stoically and the
shares closed on Friday at 504p, up 1p on the week. Shareholders clearly
remembered that, even though the economy is getting back to normal, Standard
Chartered has its own definition of business as usual.

FT  23 MAY 92 / The Long View: Who gets what in pensions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARRY RILEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHICHEVER ACTUARY naively coined the tempting word 'surplus' to describe the
financial condition of occupational pension funds has no doubt suffered the
vengeance of his professional peers, should he ever have been identified.
The terminology is important here, because the so-called surplus is not a
pot of gold but a purely theoretical construct based upon hazy projections
of future salary-linked liabilities and future investment returns. Yet
although it may be intangible and even unreal, people are prepared to fight
for it, and with reason.
The pensions industry is now getting ready for an official inquiry - even,
perhaps, a Royal Commission - and eventual legislation. The investigations
may well focus not only on the obvious security issues arising from the
Maxwell scandals but also other hotly-contended topics, of which the
ownership of surpluses is one. There will be an important but opaque
subsidiary debate here over the future of final salary-linking (the pattern
for the vast majority of British schemes) as opposed to the simpler money
purchase alternative, which is more of a what-you-pay-is-what-you-get
arrangement - or WYPIWYG as a computer man might say.
Some of the dark secrets of all this are barely acknowledged by pensions
managers and consultants. Today's occupational pension schemes are hugely
profitable for the bosses and the top managers, who get far more out of them
than they ever contribute. But they are often a swindle for many people who
change jobs frequently and for long-serving employees who are declared
redundant some years before retirement. Indeed, one of the most sinister
features of the final salary scheme is that it makes it very expensive for
companies to continue to employ people through their fifties and early
sixties, and is an important explanation for the early retirement pressures
which have become so pervasive.
A survey just published by the consultants Noble Lowndes shows that the
average Briton suffers a much greater fall in income on retirement than
elsewhere in Europe: even if he pursues a full, uninterrupted career his
income after tax will fall by 24 per cent against the EC average of 15 per
cent. But it is different for high earners. They enjoy proportionately
higher pensions than elsewhere in Europe.
Final salary plans provide the key. They were originally invented by the
Civil Service, where lifetime employment and progressive salaries were the
rule. Those who made it to Permanent Secretary could enjoy the pay rewards
after retirement as well as before; and presumably it was these Sir
Humphreys who persuaded ministers to approve the design of the pension
schemes.
But final salary schemes are not at all suitable for, say, manual workers
whose earnings are likely to peak quite early in their working lifetimes.
They are much better off with schemes which focus on their best years and
then use indexation to protect the benefits against inflation. The state
earnings-related scheme SERPS is like this. Or they could do better in money
purchase schemes so long as the contributions are securely invested over
many years.
Private sector schemes used to be on a money purchase basis but when
inflation began to rise seriously in the 1960s they were switched to final
salary linking. This was much cheaper than indexation because so few
employee members stayed as long term contributors. Company bosses, like the
Whitehall Mandarins, also came to realise that a final salary scheme could
be milked for their own benefit. A big pay rise in the last year before
retirement could be the trigger for many years of correspondingly fatter
pension payments, with no nonsense about WYPIWYG. Compare the plight of the
ordinary employee declared redundant at, say, 55 with frozen pension rights
and liable to lose up to ten years of inflation protection.
Over the past few years the government has been forced to step in to control
several of these abuses. The most controversial measure came three years ago
with the 'cap' on qualifying salaries - now Pounds 75,000. Above this limit
incomes are non-pensionable in the ordinary way, on the very reasonable
grounds that the state should not offer generous tax reliefs to people
retiring on Pounds 50,000 a year or more.
The pensions industry reacted with astonishing fury to a measure which
affected only a tiny proportion of scheme membership. Few pensions managers
themselves earn anything like Pounds 75,000 a year. But they realise that
the popularity of final salary schemes has been very largely founded on the
self-interest of company bosses. The cap only applies to those top
executives who have changed jobs since 1989. But progressively it will bite
ever harder. Top executives may start to wonder whether the traditional
schemes are really such a good idea.
A common criticism of money purchase schemes is that they are riskier for
members and do not protect against future inflation. But it is, of course,
possible to invest in index-linked gilts. These were originally introduced
by the government because there was supposed to be a demand from pension
funds. In fact pension funds have only 3 per cent of their assets in
index-linked gilts, because they have preferred riskier but more lucrative
equities.
You have to ask whether the hostility to money purchase schemes is really
because of the investment challenges they represent, or because it is
impossible for top executives to scoop the pool. Money purchase schemes have
no surpluses to be fought over.
Meanwhile, let battle commence. But if the actuaries had had the sense to
describe surpluses as, say, implied negative contribution adjustments or
residual terminal accrued balances, they might have avoided a lot of
trouble.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Reaching for the glittering prize: How long will black South
Africans be prepared to wait for real improvements in living standards? asks
Richard Lambert. And can the economy stand the strain?
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAMBERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEN TIMES, Nelson Mandela put the question: 'Is there anybody in this room
who is opposed to this principle?' Ten times, no one budged.
In one corner of the large conference hall sat State President F W de Klerk,
surrounded by a huddle of earnest looking National Party ministers. Further
round were the Democrats, and then the communists: the grandfatherly figure
of Joe Slovo, who spent 27 years of his life in exile, next to the radical
Chris Hani, who as leader of the African National Congress military wing
would, a few years ago, have been shot on sight by the policemen now
gathered to protect him.
Over on the far side were members of the Inkatha Freedom Party, minus their
leader Chief Mangosuthu Buthelezi, the one notable absentee from last
weekend's grand Convention for a Democratic South Africa (Codesa). Scattered
around sat a score of other groupings, some with proud histories, some
forever scarred by their role in the apartheid process, some with real
political power, some with none.
Occasionally the atmosphere was electric, as in the silence which followed
Mandela's demands that people who disagreed with his definitions of
democracy should identify themselves. The mixed response to his speech -
some standing and cheering, others sitting firmly in place - gave an
impression of the answer to his rhetorical questions.
But for the most part, the public part of last weekend's Codesa conference
was numbingly dull, cliche piled upon cliche. Everyone wanted the playing
fields to be levelled, invariably to their own advantage.
It is no wonder that the process was laborious. Here were the nation's
leading politicians trying to achieve three difficult tasks simultaneously:
to establish a fair and lasting peace, to create a workable constitution,
and - not least - to position themselves for the elections which must come
sooner or later.
You would have to pinch yourself to remember what was at stake: nothing less
than the future direction of a country of 38.5m people, one which has
enormous problems and even bigger potential, and which stands on the brink
of a completely new political and economic environment.
How great will the changes be? How long will black Africans be prepared to
wait for real improvements in their often appalling standards of living? Can
the economy, which has followed a decade of slow growth with three years of
stagflation, stand the strain?
To judge by the stockbrokers at lunch in Johannesburg's stock exchange
tower, the prospects are glittering. In its new Minister of Finance, Derek
Keys, South Africa at last has a successful businessman rather than an
unreliable politician in the top economic job. A fair political settlement
is in view; the ANC has realised that radical economic change would be a
disaster; foreign capital is poised to return to South Africa in large
amounts; growing wealth in the black community should lead to a decade of
rapid economic growth.
Few other people talk this language, and certainly not Derek Keys, who says
there are no magic buttons to press. 'I don't think there is any alternative
to just hard pounding,' he adds.
Yet leaders in both the business community and the ANC give the impression
that although the future may not be a matter of business as usual, it is not
going to bring startling change.
Warren Clewlow, chairman of the Barlow Rand conglomerate, believes there is
general agreement about economic priorities among the main political
groupings. 'In all the discussions I have one to one, I don't hear jarring
suggestions,' he says.
Another commonly held view is that the country's economic management has
been so bad in the past, and its place in the international marketplace so
unfavourable, that conditions cannot get any worse. Meyer Kahn, chairman of
South African Breweries and a man rich in quotable quotes, claims that 'in a
court of law, we could not be accused of handling our economy soundly over
the last 40 years.'
He does not expect this to change much. 'But a fair political settlement
would bring peace and stability in the future. I'll settle for that.'
For their part, the closer ANC leaders have been getting to power the more
conciliatory they have been sounding about future policy. Nelson Mandela has
been backing well away from a broad nationalisation programme; asked about
the case for a minimum wage, an ANC economist gives a lecture about how much
damage this would cause to employment in a country with such marked regional
differences.
For foreign investors, the emphasis a year ago was on obligations and
investment codes. Today, they are to be welcomed with open arms. 'We've
mellowed,' the ANC man explains.
But it seems unthinkable that the move to democratic government will not
bring great pressures for economic change. It is true that over the past
decade there has been a marked increase in the share of government spending
directed to blacks. Their share of total social benefits rose from 28 per
cent in 1975 to 45 per cent by 1987 and a usefully higher figure today.
Yet the inequalities remain startling. Public spending on white school
children is still four times per head greater than on black, and large
numbers of black children do not go to school at all. On one estimate, over
a fifth of black adults have had no schooling, while another third received
some primary education only.
Gencor, the successful mining finance group, reckons that about half its
workforce is illiterate.
Columns of such statistics do not prepare you for a visit to the squatter
camps scattered around prosperous, first world Cape Town. Mile upon mile of
crudely built shacks and rutted roads, with no electricity, inadequate water
supplies and sewerage, and almost no social safety nets, they can look like
the end of the world.
It is true that conditions in neighbouring states like Mozambique, Zimbabwe
or Botswana are often at least as bleak when measured by such yardsticks as
health, diet and literacy. But that is not the point. As a recent World Bank
study observes: 'Black South Africa has done at best only moderately better
than its neighbours despite its proximity to Africa's most dynamic economy.'
This is the legacy of apartheid. The problem is that poverty and inequality
cannot be removed simply by moving away from this repressive system to a
non-racial democratic state. Whatever the shape of the next government, the
South African economy will impose severe restrictions on its room for
manouevre.
The explanation lies in the record of slow growth in production and rapid
increases in population. Gross domestic product rose by about 1.5 per cent a
year in the 1980s, and the present recession has lasted for around three
years. The budget in March projected a rise of about 1 per cent this year,
but a dreadful drought and the impact of growing political violence means
that a further decline now looks likely.
Meanwhile, the population has been rising at about 2.5 per cent a year. The
result is an enormous pool of unemployed and semi-employed labour. It's
reckoned that more than two fifths of the work force have no place in the
formal sector of the economy.
You can see them scratching a living on the street corners if they are
lucky, or just standing around if they are not.
There is not much room for raising government spending, with a budget
deficit this year likely to run well ahead of a March forecast which
represented some 4.5 per cent of gdp. South Africans are already quite
highly taxed, and with inflation still running at around 15 per cent, there
is no room for an easier credit policy.
The country desperately needs rapid economic growth if it is to iron out its
present inequalities in the forseeable future. For example, Sam de Beer,
Minister of Black Education, says that even if the economy rises by 3 per
cent a year and whites are prepared to accept a sharp rise in pupil/ teacher
ratios, it would still not be possible to finance equal compulsory education
by the year 2000 without a substantial increase in the share of public
spending devoted to education. Redistributing the existing cake will not be
enough: the cake must be made bigger.
The first and most crucial step will be to resolve the present political
uncertainties. That will encourage domestic investment, and open the door to
badly needed foreign capital. There should, too, be some dividend to come
from the abolition of apartheid. It is true that cuts in defence spending
are being partly absorbed by the rising cost of policing a violent society,
and that the scope for cutting a bloated bureaucracy is not as great as you
might think. After all, most people who work for the state are black.
But a new government should no longer be tempted to throw money at vastly
expensive strategic investments, such as the Mossgas oil refinery. There
will be a chance, too, to deal with the corruption spawned by apartheid. An
official report published this month on the Department of Development Aid,
which once controlled most aspects of the lives of millions of black South
Africans, concluded: 'I am satisfied that the management is not up to its
task; that controls and control systems are grossly neglected; that
personnel are inadequate in numbers and often quality; that planning is
inadequate; that dishonesty and abuse are rife.'
South Africa, in the words of finance minister Derek Keys, has for years
been in a condition of economic civil war. The question is whether political
peace will bring the kind of national consensus that will be necessary to
persuade citizens to hold back on consumption in order to apply more to
investment. Keys says that his first priority is to find areas of economic
consensus, and he is clearly inclined to support some kind of business or
economic forum in which government, business and labour could try to build a
set of common objectives.
South Africans are forever quoting models of the kind of society they would
like to build: it is as if they are trying to reassure themselves that their
problems are not unique. Senior government ministers talk about the Swiss
political model (yes, the Swiss]). Democrats talk about Sweden, right
wingers about Israel, the ANC about Malaysia, and business about Korea or
Taiwan.
The trouble with most of these examples is that they depend either on a high
degree of social and cultural homogeneity, or on varying degrees of
authoritarianism, or on both. South Africa is split by raw conflicts of
interest, and the bulk of its workforce is poorly educated.
Violence, political and criminal, is a national preoccupation. Suburban
bungalows are swathed in metal grilles and security devices. At a liberally
inclined dinner party in Johannesburg, a guest asks discreetly where he can
leave his gun.
So it is not surprising that even from the ANC you will here talk about the
limitations of democracy. A possible straw in the wind: liberal lawyers last
week expressed outrage that the ANC has agreed in principle to detention
without trial during the first phase of political reform.
The reality is that there are no precedents for what is happening in South
Africa, and few clear signposts to the future. The main political players
have an enormous vested interests in developing an agreed constitution:
having gone so far they know they will sink or swim together. But their
interests do not coincide so clearly when it comes to the pace and nature of
the economic reforms which must follow political change.
The problems are daunting, maybe even overwhelming. But just as last
weekend's political convention would have been unimaginable three years ago,
so it would not do to underestimate the country's capacity for change. The
last word comes from SA Breweries Meyer Kahn. With a touch of the Sam
Goldwyns, he observes: 'I'm not negative about the long-term future. But the
quicker it comes, the better.'

FT  23 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Thorntons
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It seems any excuse will do for Thorntons, which launched itself on the
stock market with such high hopes four years ago. First, worries about a
Labour election victory apparently stopped people buying chocolates for
Mother's Day. Then, a Tory win suddenly stopped them buying Easter eggs for
their children. Now, after a week or two of sunshine, the summer is too hot.
All this may explain a likely profits fall of some 10 per cent in the
current year. Another reason could be that the management was late in
recognising that the recession would eventually hit confectionery too.

FT  23 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Allianz/Dresdner
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Germany's number one insurer and number two bank may have perfectly good
grounds for refuting last month's Federal Cartel Office ruling that their
ties are in breach of local competition law. The implication of their joint
statement that Allianz's 22.3 per cent stake in Dresdner is merely a routine
equity investment, though, will doubtless be taken with a pinch of salt.
That said, the document is significant for the way it highlights the
relative long-term attraction of shares over bonds, a traditionally
non-Germanic view which has quietly been winning converts in Frankfurt this
year.
As for the links which have caused the fuss, Allianz's rivals are certainly
entitled to be worried about such a powerful presence on the national
market. There is another way for the authorities to deal with this, however,
and that is to devote less effort to keeping foreign companies out of their
home territory. In a genuinely liberal European market big combinations such
as Allianz/Dresdner, ING in the Netherlands and UAP/BNP in France should not
be a threat.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There was relief all round yesterday that German money supply grew at an
annualised rate of just 8.8 per cent in April. That may be well below market
expectations, and enough to lay to rest any lingering fears of a Bundesbank
rate increase. But it is still far too early to bring forward any
expectations for the timing of a cut.
The Bundesbank's action in draining funds from the market as call money
slipped yesterday morning was a reminder that money supply performance is
still bad. Granted, the figure is liable to distortion, but even the new
lower rate of growth is too far outside the target range for the central
bank to relax about the inflationary implications of credit growth. The
prospect thus remains that monetary policy will continue on its present
tight course for some time to come.
There is a double disappointment here for those who have been claiming the
UK could break free of the German interest rate tie. That argument was
predicated in part on the erroneous assumption that Germany had suddenly
become the sick man of Europe. In fact the wage round passed off more or
less all right, there are grounds for hope that the budget deficit will be
curbed, and money supply is at least heading downwards. Things are no longer
bad enough to threaten the anchor position of the D-Mark in the ERM. That
they are also not going well enough for any let-up in the adjustment effort
means the rest of Europe will have to continue to share the pain.

The stock market brushed aside yesterday's GDP figure, even though the UK
recovery will now be starting from a lower base than most analysts had
predicted. Provisional estimates that output fell 0.6 per cent in the first
quarter, moreover, suggest that anyone forecasting an increase of much more
than 1 per cent for 1992 as a whole may spend this weekend doing a touch of
downgrading.
More encouraging, though, were last night's findings of the Confederation of
British Industry's latest monthly trends survey, which may have contributed
to a generally firm tone in equities before the close. Total order books are
still below what respondents consider normal, but they are at their best
level since August 1990, and export orders are at their best since October
1990. The survey evidence is not definitive, but more such news will help
investors convert bullish instincts into substantial buying orders. For the
moment there remains a nagging feeling that there have been false starts
before.

FT  23 MAY 92 / The Lex Column: Competition for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
It would be easy to dismiss Lloyds' hope of acquiring Midland as forlorn.
Brussels has cleared the rival suit from the Hongkong Bank and Mr Michael
Heseltine yesterday referred the Lloyds proposal to the Monopolies and
Mergers Commission. Still, it is too early to write off the UK clearer's
chances. Lloyds must have always known that referral was probable. Its
determination to stay in the fight suggests it reckons to stand a good
chance of winning the MMC debate.
Indeed, the competition issues are not as clear as many in the Hongkong Bank
camp suppose. The bid is unlikely to be disallowed simply on the basis of a
concentration of branches in West Glamorgan, Gloucestershire and
Warwickshire. The MMC is not compelled to give a straight answer. Lloyds may
decide to accept any conditions it imposes. Other banks are already quietly
expressing interest in acquiring Midland branches. Lloyds acknowledges
possible problems in the small business sector, but here it is clearly
willing to meet the requirements of the competition authorities.
Midland investors must thus still allow for the possibility that an offer
from Lloyds will eventually become firm. That will make things difficult for
HSBC. The objections to its offer - that large banking conglomerates rarely
perform well and that part of the price will be paid in loan stock of
uncertain liquidity - still hold.
HSBC will almost certainly have to consider improving its offer by providing
an underwritten cash alternative to the loan stock. But it cannot easily
increase it. The dilution could hit its own share price, wiping out any
extra value it tried to create. Lloyds is not yet condemned to look
elsewhere, however much this might disappoint investors who have pushed up
the Royal Bank of Scotland by 8 per cent this month in anticipation of it
becoming an alternative target.

FT  23 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei loses 2.5% on
lower bond prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE weakening yen and lower bond prices prompted index-linked selling and
profit-taking ahead of the weekend, and share prices lost 2.5 per cent amid
low volume, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The Nikkei average fell 470.29 to 18,221.00, opening at the day's high of
18,621.54, and falling to a low of 18,191.39 in the afternoon as index
selling accelerated.
Volume fell from 270m shares to 242m. However, with many investors staying
away from the market as some 300 companies announced their results for last
fiscal year yesterday, the lack of volume exaggerated price movements.
The Topix index of all first section stocks fell 19.62 to 1,371.70 and in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index lost 0.36 to 1,088.47. Declines outnumbered
advances by 831 to 168 with 131 issues unchanged.
Reports that the finance ministry was going to take action against a
bankrupt foods company, for window-dressing its accounts, also depressed
sentiment.
Theme stocks were active, but most fell on profit-taking. Mitsubishi Kakoki,
the most active issue of the day, was unchanged at Y1,130 and Ebara, the
industrial water pump maker, lost Y30 to Y1,530.
Bio-technology and Aids related issues also fell, with Okamoto Industries
down Y30 to Y1,340 and Meiji Milk Products losing Y15 to Y833.
Issues with poor results for the last fiscal year and weak forecasts for the
current year to March 1993 declined. Fanuc, the industrial robot maker, fell
Y210 to Y4,390. Reports that the company's pre-tax profits for the current
year to March 1993 will plunge by 29 per cent discouraged investors.
Kajima, the construction company, led the decline in that sector, falling
Y10 to Y1,080. The company expects a 20 per cent fall in pre-tax profits to
Y103bn.
Sony, which announced a operating loss for the first time since its listing
on the Tokyo Stock Exchange in 1958, fell Y50 to Y4,260.
Daiei, the supermarket chain, rose Y28 to Y941 after surging to Y1,000. It
announced that it would acquire over 30 per cent of Recruit, the publishing
and information company which was at the centre of a stock bribery scandal
in the late 1980s.
In Osaka, the OSE average retreated 360.44 to 20,891.41 in volume of 12.5m
shares.
Roundup
FINANCIALS lifted Seoul and Taiwan yesterday, while Bangkok dropped on
profit-taking.
TAIWAN moved on Thursday's approval for the listed China Trust to transform
to a commercial bank on July 2. The weighted index registered its sixth
consecutive gain to close 60.27 better at 4623.94, 7.7 per cent higher on
the week.
HONG KONG's unexpected decision to cut prime rates by one percentage point
from Monday came too late to affect trading and the Hang Seng index closed
down 5.93 to 5,859.68 for a five-day gain of 2.7 per cent. In London,
however, Hong Kong equities advanced some 2 per cent.
SEOUL's composite index rose by 9.05 to 582.88, but trading remained slow
and the index ended 1.1 per cent lower on the week. Two heavyweights, Pohang
Iron and Korea Electric, rose Won400 to Won19,400 and Won 500 to Won12,400
on news that the government will allow foreign investors to buy their
shares.
BANGKOK, still worried in the aftermath of civil strife, fell 2.7 per cent
on the day, and 2.0 per cent on the week, the SET index ending 20.16 lower
at 718.51.
MANILA consolidated, the composite index rising 2.89 to 1,379.69, 3.1 per
cent higher on the week.
AUSTRALIA continued to digest the ADollars 1.7bn loss at Westpac Banking as
the All Ordinaries index rose 1.9 to 1,684.5, up 1.4 per cent on the week.
BOMBAY finished broadly lower. The BSE index lost 124.21 to 3,435.07.

FRANKFURT rejoiced in the April M3 money supply figures and, after a 2.74
rise to 722.03 in the FAZ index at midsession, the DAX closed 17.48 better
at 1,802.96, its highest since the Gulf crisis began in August, 1990. Gains
on the week were 3.1 and 4.6 per cent respectively. Turnover rose from DM9bn
to DM9.2bn.
Among carmakers, attention turned to BMW which rose DM21.70 to DM614.506;
Volkswagen and Daimler both outpaced the market, too, VW in spite of worries
about short-term operating profits, and guarantees to finance subsidiaries
in mid-week.
In steels, Mannesmann rose DM9.60 to DM306. This was chart-inspired, a
broker said, since DM300 had been seen as a strong resistance level.
MILAN surmounted a bout of profit-taking to close higher again, the Comit
index ending 5.37 higher at 493.78 on the day, up 4.5 per cent on the week.
Fiat led again on speculation about further international alliances
following its Dollars 2bn accord with FSM of Poland, closing at L5,380
against L5,285 in the kerb on Thursday.
PARIS made a positive start to the June account, helped by the firm
performance of oils, and by stronger bonds. The CAC-40 index advanced 28.29
to 2,045.12 for a gain of 1 per cent over the week. Turnover was some
FFr2.53bn.
Total and Elf both had good days as the Opec meeting appeared to be nearing
an agreement on output. Total, which rose FFr9.30 to FFr260, also announced
that it had signed an agreement with Russia to bring a new oil field on
line. Elf was FFr12.50 better at FFr394.
Alcatel Alsthom rose FFr9 to FFr652. Dealers noted that this was a rebound
after declines earlier this week, following Alcatel's placement of 10m ADSs
in the US.
AMSTERDAM was firmer with the CBS Tendency index up 0.4 at 130.4 for a rise
of 1.8 per cent on the week.
Buehrmann-Tetterode, a good performer this week, rose Fl 2.50 to Fl 52.50.
The paper and packaging group pleased the market last week with first
quarter results which suggested that it was well-placed for recovery. A
number of buy recommendations have been issued and foreign buying has been
active.
Royal Dutch closed Fl 1.10 firmer at Fl 152.50 on expectations of a
conclusion to the Opec ministers' meeting in Vienna.
Grolsch, the brewer, seemed to be benefiting from the hot weather as
Heineken had done earlier in the week, rising Fl 2.80 to Fl 207.80.
Fokker had another active day but closed unchanged at Fl 35.10 after seeing
an intraday high of Fl 35.80.
ZURICH followed Frankfurt up, encouraged additionally by the fall from 5.0
to 4.3 per cent in the latest annual monthly consumer price inflation
figures from the city of Basle. The SMI index closed 7.0 higher at 1,931.7,
a gain of 0.6 per cent on the week.
STOCKHOLM saw foreign interest in Asea and Electrolux help to enliven an
otherwise dull day. The Affarsvarlden index finished up 0.3 to 1,001.4 for a
gain of 1.6 per cent on the week. Turnover was a moderate SKr518m from
SKr731m on Thursday.
Asea and Electrolux B shares both gained SKr4, to SKr385 and SKr286
respectively.
BRUSSELS was firmer in fairly active trade. The Bel-20 index gained 1.92 to
1,215.78, for a 0.8 per cent rise on the week. Kredietbank was up BFr25 to
BFr4,995 after reporting better-than-expected net profits for 1991/92.
OSLO recovered on higher oil prices. The all-share index advanced 3.37 to
451.93 in turnover of NKr235.3m.

FT  23 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Frankfurt climbs after months of
stagnation - The German equity market has taken this week's two big news
items to its heart
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
At last, after months of stagnation, it has been a good week for the German
equity market. The DAX index has climbed 4.5 per cent in the past five days.
The reason for this surge is that the rubbish has gone from the streets, and
the headlines have improved - all of a sudden things seem to be going right
for Germany again.
True, there is no sign that the Bundesbank is set to cut its rates at its
next Council meeting, or that the government is going to be able to sort out
its spending plans in the next week or two or, indeed, that the level of
productivity in the eastern part of Germany is set to come up to that of the
west in a matter of months.
However, the public sector workers' strike of the past weeks - which seemed
to be but an inconvenient and malodorous precursor to a more general
breakdown in Germany's hitherto successful social-market economy - did not
lead, as investors had feared, to a damaging strike by the metalworkers.
Instead, at midnight last Sunday, employers and employees reached a 21 month
deal which provided a 5.8 per cent increase this year and a 3.4 per cent
rise next year. This was not as good as the Bundesbank might have liked, but
better than the market expected and the cue for a 2 per cent spring in the
DAX on Monday.
According to analysts, much of the buying then reflected traders' attempts
to square 'short' positions taken last week in anticipation of a vicious
strike and a serious fall in the market. But as the week progressed, there
was more good news and some genuine international and domestic investment
buying.
As Mr Gunter Kirchhain of the Deutsche Bank's institutional investors' team
in Dusseldorf quipped, the metalworkers' settlement suggested that 'the much
heralded German disease was little more than a viral infection'. With a
variation on the imagery, Mr Jurgen Rothig of BZW in Frankfurt said it
proved that Germany 'did not suffer from the English disease at all'.
In more sober language, Mr Hans Peter Wodniok at James Capel in Frankfurt
observed that a wage-price spiral - fears of which had inspired the
stock-market stagnation of recent weeks - was no longer on the cards.
On Tuesday, the country's 1.5m building workers fell into line, accepting a
5.8 per cent pay offer, thus stirring up interest in the construction sector
to complement buying of carmakers, chemicals and engineering companies.
Further impetus came the same day when Daimler-Benz, Germany's largest
industrial company, predicted that it would enjoy an 'excellent result' for
the current year. Mr Edzard Reuter, its chief executive, said that current
year profits would be higher this year than last - evidence that Daimler is
set to turn the long-awaited profits corner after years of earnings
stagnation.
In addition, it emerged that AEG, the Daimler electricals subsidiary which
has been a long-term drain on its parent's resources, is not set to burden
Daimler with any losses this year. Thus on Wednesday the market was
propelled still higher to 1,787.50, its highest level since August 1990,
with volume surging to DM9.9bn from DM7.2bn the day before.
To cap the week, yesterday's money-supply figures were better than expected.
Broad money as measured by M3 rose by 8.8 per cent in the year to April,
after a revised 9.4 per cent increase for the previous month. This is still
significantly higher than the Bundesbank's 3.5 to 5.5 per cent target range
 -but better than expectations of more than 9 per cent. The news provided a
fillip to both bond and equity prices.
The market is now alive with suggestions that the DAX is on course to reach
its pre-Gulf, all-time high of 1,976.43 by the end of the year, perhaps
sooner. However, Mr Mark Edmiston of Goldman Sachs in London is not alone in
predicting that a target of 1,850 is more realistic, for the next three
months at least, and that other bourses are more attractive at present.
For, despite this week's outbreak of optimism, the future trend of share
prices is more likely to be determined by the outlook for interest rates
than by anything else. Once they start to come down - or, rather, once
investors are convinced that they are to be cut in the not too distant
future - the market is likely to take off.
This week's developments are not in themselves enough to induce a policy
shift from the Bundesbank. Commentators believe that the metalworkers'
settlement was low enough to remove the possibility of another rise - but
that it will not lead automatically to a cut. Mr Helmut Schlesinger,
Bundesbank president, said on Monday night that the agreement followed a
pattern of excessive awards in recent months.
Even if present inflation rates dropped to between 3.5 to 4 per cent by the
end of the year, from 4.6 per cent at present, that would still be too high,
said Mr Schlesinger said. And money supply was growing too rapidly, he
cautioned.
Thus it seems that the spectre of monetary rectitude will hover over the
market for some months ahead although, as Mr Jochen Neynaber of
Schroder-Munchmeyer Hengst puts it, the pay settlement at the beginning of
the week makes it much more likely 'that there will be a cut in rates -
eventually'.

FT  23 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Footsie future leads equities higher
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER struggling gamely all week to remain above the Footsie 2,700 level
London's equity market moved into overdrive as the session drew to a close,
finishing a net 13 points higher at 2,715.
The late rise was triggered by a strong run in the Footsie future during the
late afternoon, ahead of an encouraging survey by the Confederation of
British Industry, and a firm showing by Wall Street which showed a
double-figure rise as London closed. Adding to a generally positive feeling
around the market was some good economic news from Germany, which
specialists said finally put paid to any fears that German interest rates
may have to rise in the short term.
The trading session began in subdued fashion, with many traders expecting a
very quiet day ahead of the long bank holiday weekend.
The Footsie kicked off marginally higher at 2.402.2, but quickly dipped
below 2,700, reaching the day's low point of 2,697.5, down 4.5, as the
Footsie future dropped sharply. The early slide was arrested within minutes,
however, as initial pressure on the future was reversed, driving the cash
market higher with it.
By 10 am the Footsie was 11 points higher at 2,713, looking set fair for a
strong run, before it dipped dipping off in the wake of the 0.6 per cent
fall in gross domestic product figure during the first quarter. Towards the
close, however, a sudden burst of buying activity, said to have originated
in the futures market, saw the Footsie future's premium re-established and
prompted a flurry of buying interest across the board in the cash market,
which left the Footsie index at the day's best level as the market closed.
The oil sector was one of the few areas of the market to perform well from
start to finish, stimulated by expectations of higher oil prices after the
current Opec meeting. But the Kuwait Investment Office killed off one of the
market's wilder rumours but by firmly rejecting suggestions that it was
about to sell its near-10 per cent stake in BP.
Salomon Brothers was responsible for the exceptional performance of
Vodafone, taking the view that any PCN threat to the cellular industry would
be confined to the M-25 area and, at best, extremely limited for at least
three years. Turnover in equities came out at 522.9m shares.
Gilts maintained their recent good showing with long-dated stocks up around
a half-point.
The level of customer, or retail, business on the London market fell away
this week but remains ahead of levels reached at this stage last year.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Commodities (Week in the Markets): Brazil and Colombia stir
coffee
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COFFEE markets in both London and New York tumbled yesterday after
moving slowly ahead throughout the early part of the week after talks
between Brazil and Colombia, the two biggest producers, about possible
action to halt the slide in prices.
The talks were initially seen as bullish, but the details of what was agreed
when the two countries met at the beginning of the week have been hard to
come by. In early trading yesterday New York's nearby July arabica contract
fell by more than 2 cents a lb as uncertainty over the producers' position
grew. The London July robusta contract closed at Dollars 732, down Dollars
17 on the day and Dollars 2 on the week.
Yesterday's fall was boosted by news that Costa Rica was resuming exports.
Ironically when it suspended exports on May 12 in protest against low world
prices there was no market reaction on the upside.
A report that the Mexican coffee industry still favours a free market,
coupled with a statement in support of the free market by the US National
Coffee Association added to the bearish tone.
Brazil and Colombia are thought to be aiming for a transitional accord at
the September meeting of the International Coffee Organisation in September.
They have been spurred into action following the unexpectedly sharp fall in
coffee prices after an indecisive ICO meeting last month. But the two giants
of the coffee world are treading warily because they do not want to upset
either their fellow producers or the consumers.
Mr Jorge Cardenas, of Colombia's National Coffee Growers Federation, said on
Thursday that nothing had been signed by the two countries, according to a
Reuters report. 'We have some documents as reference points,' he said. 'But
obviously we don't want to turn those documents into a concrete proposal for
the other producers  . but to start a dialogue with them regarding the same
issues and to reach a consensus, one as open as possible.'
Next week Brazil and Colombia will join the other coffee producing countries
for a series of meetings at the ICO headquarters in London. Their ideas,
which are thought to include a world export quota level of 64m bags (60kgs
each) to counteract large consumer stocks, are expected to be presented
informally.
Cocoa prices have taken a downward path again following a cut to 107,000
tonnes in the estimated 1991-92 world supply-demand deficit by Gill &amp;
Duffus, the London trader. Production is put at 2.26m tonnes, down from
2.55m the previous year, but consumption is estimated to be virtually
unchanged at 2.34m tonnes, mainly because of a collapse in grindings in the
former Soviet Union to a mere 25,000 tonnes.
Mr Lawrence Eagles, analyst with GNI, the London futures brokers, said the
market was worried more by the slow growth in consumption than the decline
in the deficit. The point when stocks were drawn down to the level where a
bull market could take off appeared to have been postponed at least until
1994-95.
The London July contract touched a fresh 16 1/2 -year low of Pounds 548 a
tonne yesterday before closing at Pounds 556, down Pounds 22 on the week.
The London Metal Exchange base metals markets have had a quiet week,
although volatility in the tin market, which hit a 19-month high on
Thursday, has provided some interest. Yesterday cash tin closed at Dollars
6,190 a tonne, unchanged on the week, as the market erased earlier steep
losses incurred after a rise of 665 tonnes in LME warehouse stocks.
The London bullion market has also been quiet during the week in which two
important annual books were published - Johnson Matthey's Platinum 1992 and
Gold Fields Mineral Services' Gold 1992.
The platinum market regarded Johnson Matthey's publication as bullish for
the market with its predictions that exports from the former Soviet Union
would fall, Japanese demand would hold, and problems with South African
production would persist.
Platinum was fixed yesterday at Dollars 365.75 a troy ounce, up Dollars 4.25
on the day and Dollars 7.25 on the week, and the highest fix for three
months. Heavy trade buying pushed it through the Dollars 364-Dollars 365
resistance area, dealers said.
The gold market closed yesterday at Dollars 337.70 a troy ounce, down
Dollars 1.70 on the week, and was described by one analyst yesterday as 'a
haven of inertia' - a fitting tribute given that nine weeks ago it closed at
Dollars 339.05.

FT  23 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity Futures and Options Trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE was exceptionally heavy trading in the Footsie future, with many
observers surprised at a series of buying bursts during what had been
expected to be a relatively subdued pre-weekend session, writes Steve
Thompson.
Some early aggressive selling pressure by locals (independent traders) drove
the June contract down from an opening 2,717 to 2,708 minutes after the
opening.
However, with the future looking cheap against the cash market and with some
determined buying by arbitraguers entering the market, the June contract
quickly stabilised and moved up strongly to the mid-2,720s.
It held around this level until the late afternoon when a squeeze developed
prompting a sudden burst of buying, and leaving the contract at 2,739 at the
close. This was up 11 points on the day and an estimated fair value premium
to cash of around 16 points.
Turnover at the official close was 8,706 contracts, with dealers pointing
out that over 6,000 contracts had been traded by lunchtime.
In traded options, turnover was poor, reaching only 26,575 lots. BP was the
heaviest traded stock option.

FT  23 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Midland lifted by referral
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE mid-afternoon news that the UK Monopolies and Mergers Commission was to
investigate the Pounds 3.7bn conditional bid from Lloyds Bank for the
Midland, leaving the way clear for the success of the rival bid from the
Hong Kong and Shanghai Bank, boosted trade in the latter and caused the
former to go into retreat.
The news helped Midland move 6 higher to 405p, on healthy turnover of 5m
shares, while the setback left Lloyds 4 lighter at 226p.
While the view still holds in some quarters that the HSBC offer should win
the day, one explanation for yesterday's rise in the Midland share price was
the view, gaining ground, that Lloyds is likely to fight on. Talk in the
market has Lloyds possibly launching a formal bid at a higher price, or
going into the market and bidding aggressively for Midland shares.
One analyst said: 'Lloyds is unlikely to take this lying down. Too much
management time has been spent to leave it at this.'
Vodafone surges
Dismissing the notion of a major price war between the two main cellular
operators, US securities house Salomon Brothers yesterday reiterated its
strong buy recommendation on Vodafone, sending the shares forward in busy
trading.
The shares were helped by a stock shortage which traders said had been
building up all week. The Salomon move came after it had held discussions
with Vodafone and BT, owner of Cellnet. The securities house concluded that
any price competition would be limited to the M25 corridor, and that
nationally the businesses would not clash.
Vodafone shares rose 12 to 389p, helped by strong US buying, with 6.6m
traded. BT, basking in the glow of its well-received results on Thursday,
saw the fully-paid advance 6 1/2 to 366 1/2 p, and the partly-paid 6 to 144
1/2 p, with 12m and 23.6m traded respectively.
Comments made by the SmithKline Beecham chairman to a conference in London
on Thursday regarding prospects for a number of the group's drugs were well
received in the market, the shares jumping 20 to 890p.
Mr Bob Bauman told a healthcare seminar at Lehman Brothers that the outlook
for three of SmithKline's new products was encouraging. Relafen, an
arthritis drug, had taken a 5.6 per cent market share in the US after only
two months. Anti-depressant Seroxat had grabbed a 15 per cent market shares
since its arrival in the UK earlier this year, and Kytril had just been
launched in Japan and was well-placed to take a large stake in the
anti-nausea market.
The positive sentiment lifted Glaxo, the shares rising 13 to 759p.
A strong oil sector was underpinned by the Opec meeting and a firmer crude
price. British Gas rose 4 1/2 to 250 1/2 p, Enterprise Oil 5 to 422p and
Shell 5 to 507p.
After its recent battering, Lasmo bounced back, the shares rising 7 to 199p.
They were helped by news that the oil group had disposed of shares in its
Canadian subsidiary, netting Lasmo CDollars 38m. BP settled 3 up at 262p,
after 264p on relatively good turnover of 8.9m shares. Towards the close of
trading the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO) said it had no plans to sell its
9.98 per cent stake in BP. BP shares raced higher in midweek as stories
circulated that Hanson was about to buy the KIO stake at a price well ahead
of the current market level. Old hands in the market described the story as
'no more than an old-fashioned ramp.'
In the rest of the banking sector, TSB which until the Lloyds/ Midland news
had gone into retreat, bounced on speculation that Lloyds could turn its
attentions to TSB should its attempts to acquire the Midland meet with
failure. The shares firmed 2 1/2 to 150 1/2 p. The uncertainity about the
level of losses the bank could face following the Bombay financial debacle
continued to cast a cloud over Standard Chartered. The shares gave up
another 7 to 504p. SG Warburg firmed 4 to 601p, ahead of figures next week.
Reratings in BTR and Williams Holdings by broker Smith New Court sent the
shares falling. BTR closed 3 off at 496p, while Williams retreated 6 to
348p, after Smith moved the shares from a buy to a hold. Mr Bruce Davidson
at Smith New Court said: 'The multiple of the two is similar and on our
projections are at about a 5 per cent premium to the market this year. When
compared with cyclical sectors the shares are not on a cheap rating.'
Smith also had a look at Tomkins and reiterated its current stance that the
shares had ran ahead. The shares closed 6 lighter at 502p.
An upbeat annual meeting boosted Cookson Group, and the shares firmed 5 to
165p.
General profit-taking coupled with caution about financial stocks from
broker SG Warburg led to falls in a number of insurance related stocks.
These included Legal and General, 5 lighter at 410p, and Prudential, 5
easier at 263p.
Stores were active as brokers took the opportunity to reflect on the sector
in the light of recent results. Nomura decided it liked Marks &amp; Spencer
citing the group's sales growth potential and falling cost base. The house
has also been advising clients to switch out of food retailers, for which it
predicts continued weakness, and into the stores sector. Marks shares leapt
6 to 345p.
Kleinworth Benson reiterated its buy stance on Kingfisher, considering the
stock to have been left behind of late. The shares rose 12 to 575p. Credit
Lyonnais Laing was also reported to have turned negative on Great Universal
Stores, off 21 at 1534p.
By far the biggest turnover of the day was in Brown and Jackson, as the
company EGM approved a re-capitalisation of the Poundstretcher stores group,
and other measures to ensure a firmer financial footing. The shares closed
unchanged at 10 1/4 p.
The decision to reform the EC agricultural policy hit Dalgety, which
produces animal feed and is considered to be vulnerable should there be less
cattle. The shares slid 10 to 432p.
Profit-taking hit Ranks Hovis McDougall which lost 8 to 224p. In food
retailing, Argyll Group was also subject to the same treatment, the shares
off 5 at 356p. Tesco again retreated, the shares losing 7 to 264p.
Leading property stocks continued to benefit from the positive sentiment
exuding from this week's Land Securities results. There has also been talk
of an improving climate in the retail sectors in London and the provinces.
However, the London office rental market remains dire. Land Securities added
2 to 450p and MEPC 4 to 355p. Mountleigh, which is being supported by its
bankers and faces a potentially crunch day next week with foreign creditors,
crumbled further, down  3/4 to 3p.
Profit-taking in Yorkshire Chemicals saw it retreat 9 to 380p. A similar
fate befell British Vita, off 5 at 279p.
Positive annual meetings at both Laird Group and Weir Group boosted the
shares. Laird moved 8 ahead to 343p, also helped by a clutch of broker's
recommendations, while Weir gained 4 to 579p.
Continued worries about the German government pulling out of the European
Fighter Aircraft project weakened Rolls-Royce, making it the biggest
percentage faller in the FT-SE as the shares shed 4 1/2 to 168p, and some
5.2m shares changed hands.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar continues to strengthen
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR continued to strengthen against the D-Mark and other European
currencies yesterday as the market saw more evidence that the differential
between German and US short-term interest rates is unlikely to widen
further, writes James Blitz.
Part of the reason for renewed confidence in the US currency was the news
that German monetary supply in April had grown more slowly than expected.
After last month's poor figure showing a 9.75 per cent rise for March, the
April figure for M3 money supply came in at 8.8 per cent, dashing fears that
it would be in double figures.
That will take pressure off those in the German central bank who were
tempted to raise rates again. So, too, will the figure for Germany's March
retail sales, which were down 6.4 per cent year-on-year, when many had
expected it to be down by far less.
Combined with the Federal Reserve's apparent unwillingness to cut rates, the
interest rate differential now looks less likely to widen further. As a
result, the markets pushed the dollar up to DM1.6240 in early European
trading.
However, confidence in the dollar wore off later in the day. Some traders
speculated that this weekend's preparatory meeting for the July summit of
the Group of Seven leading industrial nations might make a statement that
the D-Mark should be stronger. Others are still waiting for better
indications of US economic recovery before becoming convinced dollar bulls.
As a result, the dollar closed in London at DM1.6185, up nearly half a
pfennig on the day. In late American trading, it declined further, down to
DM1.6170.
The yen also made significant gains against the D-Mark, which was pushed
below the important psychological barrier of Y80. Dealers said that the yen
had gained from the German currency's downside in D-Mark/dollar trading.
'The dollar was in more demand against the mark than against the yen, and
this had the effect of pushing the mark down on the yen cross rate,' one
trader said. The D-Mark ended down on the day at Y79.83, compared to a
previous close of Y80.80.
Sterling also gained against the D-Mark, as the markets clearly ignored the
fall in period rates in the sterling cash markets in recent days. Instead,
one London-based analyst suggested that dealers were impressed by the
British Chancellor's statement earlier this week that he wants to get
inflation down to 2 per cent.
The pound gained half a pfennig against the D-Mark to close at DM2.9375. But
UK economic indicators this week have been mostly mixed, and sterling has
never looked likely to push through its central rate of DM2.95.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Short rates higher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SHORT-TERM rates in the sterling cash markets ended marginally higher
yesterday after the Bank of England forecast a large shortage that was not
fully removed during the day.
But the trade in sterling futures had a slightly more bullish tone, as
dealers got more optimistic about a possible cut in base rates.
Cash rates for one-week and one-month money ended slightly higher at the end
of a day on which the Bank had forecast a larger-than-expected shortage of
Pounds 2.1bn. The rate for one-week money ended at 10 1/8 per cent, up from
9 3/4 per cent the previous day. The rate for 1-month money ended at 10 per
cent, up  1/16 per cent from the previous close. Further out, the rates for
everything from 3-months to 1-year ended at the same level of 9 15/16 per
cent offered.
The rise in short-term rates was the result of a much stickier day in
dealing with the Bank of England. On Thursday, a Pounds 1.3bn shortage was
completely removed in the morning. But yesterday, there was a shortfall of
almost Pounds 300m at the end of the day.
In early operations, the Bank purchased Pounds 7m of Band-1 bank bills at 9
7/8 per cent. The shortage was later revised to around Pounds 2.05bn before
taking account of the early operations.
Later, the Bank purchased Pounds 100m of Band-1 Treasury bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, and Pounds 30m for resale to the market in equal amounts on 9,10 and
11 June at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank purchased Pounds 121m of Band-1 Treasury bills at
9 7/8 per cent, Pounds 728m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, Pounds
95m of Band-2 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent, and Pounds 78m also for resale
to the market in equal amounts on 9,10, 11 June at an interest rate of 9
15/16 per cent. The Bank provided late assistance of around Pounds 505m.
Trading in the sterling futures market was far more bullish, influenced
perhaps by the Bundesbank's decision not to raise German interest rates on
Thursday, as some people had feared.
September short sterling ended two ticks up on the day at 90.36. This
suggests that 3-month LIBOR four months from now will be at 9.64 per cent.
December short sterling also closed higher, up five ticks to 90.64. This
suggests that 3-month LIBOR at the end of the year will be at 9.36 per cent.

FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: GM chairman underlines policy of
'profits first'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MR Robert Stempel, chairman of General Motors, yesterday underscored the
company's sharp change of policy when he said its heavily loss-making North
American operations would concentrate on 'profits first' and less on
maintaining market share.
He also told shareholders at the company's annual meeting that GM now aimed
to operate at 100 per cent capacity in 1994, a year ahead of the completion
of a North American restructuring announced last December. Analysts reckon
GM plants are running on average at little more than 60 per cent capacity.
His remarks followed a boardroom coup last month by GM's non-executive
directors, unhappy at the management's slow movement in grappling with the
North American losses. Mr Stempel was removed from the leadership of a board
committee, while his right-hand man, Mr Lloyd Reuss, was replaced as company
president by Mr Jack Smith.
Since then, the company has greatly accelerated its programme for
restructuring North America. Mr Stempel said yesterday the focus had moved
from 'market share with profitability' to 'profit first'.
GM, which saw its US car market share plunge from around 46 per cent at the
start of the 1980s in the face of Japanese competition, has managed to
stabilise the total at around 35 per cent - but partly by unprofitable sales
to fleet buyers, such as car rental companies.
Mr Stempel said the company was pursuing five strategies to improve profits.
These included consolidating the number of vehicle 'platforms,' or basic
sub-structures, used to make its North American models as well as the number
of component sets. It would also intensify its use of the 'lean'
manufacturing methods pioneered by Japanese companies.
GM was also moving to a system of buying materials for its US manufacturing
plants from the cheap suppliers, wherever in the world they might be.

FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: JVC turns in first deficit for
four decades
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN BURTON

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IN ANOTHER sign of the troubles afflicting the Japanese consumer electronics
industry, JVC yesterday reported its first loss in four decades with a
pre-tax deficit of Y2.3bn (Dollars 17m) for the fiscal year ending in March.
The result, however, was better than JVC's expectation that it would lose
Y2.8bn. It forecast a return to profitability in the current fiscal year
with pre-tax earnings of Y1bn, well below the Y22bn it earned in fiscal
1990.
Sales fell 5 per cent to Y606bn, while net earnings fell by 96 per cent to
Y544m due to extraordinary costs associated with the restructuring of its 18
sales subsidiaries in Japan. Sales are expected to fall further in fiscal
1992 to Y580bn due to weak demand in Japan, while the net profit will climb
to Y1bn.
The dividend was cut to Y10 from Y12.50 the previous year.
Consolidated sales slipped by 9 per cent to Y839bn, while net earnings
dropped by 88 per cent to Y2bn.
JVC has been hurt by lower demand in Japan, the US and Europe for consumer
electronics.
Pioneer, the Japanese consumer electronics concern, reported a 13.4 per cent
fall in pre-tax profits to Y33bn for fiscal 1991 and predicted a further 20
per cent decrease in the current fiscal year.
Sales rose by 4.9 per cent to Y416bn as an increase in exports limited the
effects of a downturn in the Japanese market.
But earnings were adversely affected by slimmer profit margins due to the
appreciation of the yen and strong competition in both Japan and abroad. Net
profits fell by 11.9 per cent to Y17.8bn.

FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: Earnings at Mazda tumble 60%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOWNTURN in the Japanese car market last year led to a 60 per cent fall
in pre-tax profit at Mazda to Y19.7bn (Dollars 151m). The car maker was also
bruised by increased depreciation charges on new production facilities.
Mazda had hoped that the introduction of new medium-sized and luxury models
last year would itself have stimulated demand within Japan, but its sales in
the domestic market fell from 599,650 units to 549,627 units and total sales
value rose by only 3.5 per cent to Y2,304bn.
The company is forecasting an even tougher year ahead, with pre-tax profit
down to Y15bn and sales slightly higher at Y2,430bn. However, the continuing
weakness in the domestic market may force downward revisions in coming
months.
Like most other Japanese makers, Mazda had presumed in the late 1980s that
the remarkable growth in car sales which accompanied the expansion of the
'financial bubble' would continue indefinitely, and the company was prompted
to add extra production capacity.
But new car registrations in Japan started falling in the last quarter of
1990 and the decline last calendar year was 6.5 per cent. While some makers
were able to expand their sales revenue by increasing exports, Mazda's
exports increased by only 3,795 units to 859,638 units.
One consequence of the difficult conditions was a Y72.4bn fall in Mazda's
cash deposits to Y108.9bn, and a Y10.7bn increase to Y83.7bn in finished
products on hand.

FT  23 MAY 92 / International Company News: Allianz and Dresdner condemn
Berlin ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WALLER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ALLIANZ, Europe's largest insurance company, and Dresdner Bank, Germany's
second largest bank, yesterday condemned the German cartel office's ruling
that Allianz should reduce its shareholding in Dresdner and that the two
should cut back their co-operation in the German life assurance market.
For the first time since the end of March, when the Berlin-based federal
cartel office ordered Allianz to cut its stake in Dresdner from more than 22
per cent to about 19 per cent, the two institutions spelled out their
detailed objections to the office's findings.
The Berlin move is seen as an attack on the heart of Germany's financial and
industrial establishment. Yesterday's statement, couched in what for Germany
is unusually confrontational language, means that there is likely to be a
long battle as the two institutions fight the ruling in the courts.
The two institutions insisted that their co-operation in the German life
market - the biggest in Europe with annual premiums of more than DM50bn
(Dollars 30.3bn) - was not anti-competitive. Dresdner had decided in 1989
that the best way to proceed in the life market was to team up with
insurers, the statement said. There was no question that the link with
Allianz was preventing it from setting up its own life company, as the
cartel office has alleged.
They rejected the authorities' charge that Allianz dominates the life market
through its network of holdings in Dresdner and other life companies.
'Healthy competition reigns in the life market,' the statement declared,
adding that there were plenty of other link-ups between banks and insurance
companies which had not so far aroused the authorities' concern.
Allianz said that its shareholding in Dresdner ought to be seen as an 'above
averagely profitable capital investment' - by implication not a means to
exercise unwelcome control over the bank's management. It said there was no
way that Allianz could exercise a voting majority of Dresdner's shares, as
the cartel office alleged.

DAIEI, Japan's largest supermarket chain, will acquire a one-third stake in
Recruit from Mr Hiromasa Ezoe, the former chairman who was at the centre of
the 1988 bribery scandal involving the publishing and information company,
writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The stake was sold for an estimated Y50bn (Dollars 384m) which will be used
to restructure the business. The real estate and finance subsidiaries face
heavy debts due to sharp falls in land and stock prices.
The purchase will give Daiei, which is based in western Japan and has been
hindered in its expansion into the Tokyo area due to higher land prices,
access to Recruit's properties.
It will also allow Daiei, which controls 20 per cent of Japan's supermarket
trade, to diversify.

FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Whitbread cuts stake in Brakspear
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHITBREAD, the brewing and retailing group, has reduced its holding in
Brakspear, the Henley-based brewer, from 27 per cent to 8.8 per cent. As a
result, Whitbread will avoid provisions of the government's beer orders that
would have forced it to free another 60 of its tied pubs.
The orders require brewers owning more than 2,000 pubs to untie half of the
excess. But any large brewery group with a stake of 15 per cent or more in
another brewer must include that brewer's pubs in its total estate.
Whitbread has avoided the addition of Brakspear's pubs to its total by
selling 12.36 per cent of its original stake to the Whitbread Investment
Company (WIC), and nearly 6 per cent to Brakspear. The group declined to
give any financial details of the transactions.
WIC's 31.4 per cent holding in Marston Thompson &amp; Evershed, 21.9 per cent of
Boddington, and 15.3 per cent stake in Devenish, have also to be reduced
before November.
Scottish &amp; Newcastle has arranged a reciprocal trading deal with Marston
covering key brands. Marston will offer McEwan's lager, McEwan's Export and
Beck's beer in some of its pubs and to its free trade customers; S&amp;N will
distribute Marston's Pedigree bitter in Scotland and north-east England.

pre-tax for the half year to end-March.
Turnover was little changed at Pounds 37m (Pounds 37.95m) but exceptional

declined to 0.45p (1.13p) and the interim dividend is a same-again 1.07p.
An extraordinary charge of Pounds 1.5m (nil) represented the anticipated
costs of the withdrawal from the Irish linen manufacturing operations.

FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Sycamore rises sharply to Pounds 0.3m
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Sycamore Holdings, a maker of kitchen furniture, foundry and leisure
products, returned profits of Pounds 314,000 pre-tax for the half year to
end-March, a substantial improvement over last time's Pounds 113,000.
Turnover totalled Pounds 9.69m (Pounds 3.95m) with the second quarter
contribution up by 45 per cent over the first quarter's and profitability
returning to a 'level more in line with target'.
The second half is traditionally better and the directors said a
continuation of the second quarter improvement in turnover was reflected in
the forward order book which currently stood at Pounds 4.4m compared with
Pounds 2.6m at the September year-end.
Earnings per share were 0.29p (0.24p).

FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Exceptionals put Trimoco in the red
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The costs of dealing with the recession in the motor market left Trimoco,
the Luton-based motor dealer, with pre-tax losses of Pounds 578,000 in the
year to March 31, compared with profits of Pounds 2.5m.
After lower interest charges of Pounds 2.75m (Pounds 4.06m) there was a
pre-exceptionals profit of Pounds 1m (Pounds 2.35m). However exceptional
charges relating to cost-cutting actions, including reducing the workforce
by 110, amounted to Pounds 1.58m.
The company said that the period saw continuing and increasingly difficult
trading conditions with the sale of new vehicles continuing to fall and
demand for used vehicles being patchy.
During the period borrowings were cut by Pounds 3m.
Turnover was lower at Pounds 218.9m (Pounds 245.6m). After a tax credit of
Pounds 331,000 (Pounds 645,000 charge) earnings per share were 0.2p (1.68p)
basic or 0.05p (1.39p) fully diluted.
Against the background of the results, the balance sheet position and the
company's confidence for the longer term future the proposed final dividend
is halved to 0.4p for a total payment of 1p (1.4p).

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HALLS HOMES &amp; Gardens, USM-quoted garden products and home improvement
group, yesterday announced a sharp increase in pre-tax losses from Pounds
2.9m to Pounds 7.2m for 1991.
At the interim stage Mr Jon Moulton, chairman, announced a loss of Pounds
2.46m compared with a profit of Pounds 7,000 and warned shareholders that
full year results would be worse than those for 1990.
He said the market had ceased to decline but that the group's balance sheet
had been seriously eroded by losses. The company continued to have the
support of its bank.
Proposals were to be put to shareholders before the end of September for a
rights issue to put the company's finances into better shape.

FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Embarrassing problem for Lloyds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TORONTO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE THE takeover battle for Midland rages between Lloyds Bank and Hongkong
Bank in the UK, in Canada Lloyds is paying Hongkong Bank to solve its bad
debt problems in an embarrassing aftermath to its venture into the Canadian
banking market.
When Hongkong Bank bought Lloyds Bank Canada, a loss-making operation, in
May 1990 for CDollars 190m (Pounds 89.6m), it structured the deal so that it
would be sheltered from bad debts in LBC's portfolio.
Lloyds agreed to set up a CDollars 300m pool of revolving funding into which
its bad debts would be placed. Once there they are managed by Hongkong Bank
on a straightforward commercial basis.
The bad debts, mostly to the medium-sized corporate market, were accumulated
in the second half of the 1980s when Lloyds Bank still hoped to expand its
banking business in north America.
Management fees and interest charges cost Lloyds around CDollars 25m each
year for the services of the Hongkong Bank's team of problem debt managers.
Two staff of Lloyds Bank are seconded full-time to the debt management
operation in Toronto to see that fair play is maintained. The terms of the
deal were also structured to ensure that Hongkong Bank does not allow bad
debts to remain in the funding pool longer than absolutely necessary.
Nevertheless, two years after the sale of the Canadian bank around CDollars
223m of bad debts are still in the pool and there is no sign that the slate
will be wiped clean before August 1995 when the pool is due to be
liquidated.
Under the terms of the agreement, Lloyds Bank will then have to pay up to
CDollars 100m of any further losses.
Since its purchase of the former Lloyds Bank Canada network, Hongkong Bank
claims to have pushed operation back into the black by cutting operating
costs and sharply reducing the number of management staff.
On Thursday, Hongkong Bank of Canada announced improved first quarter
profits of Dollars C14.2m, up from Dollars C11.3m in the same period last
year.

FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Election and hot weather melt profits at
Thorntons
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER beating off recession, Thorntons, the luxury chocolates seller, has
finally fallen foul of Britain's fickle, and apparently unfilial, consumers.
The company yesterday issued a profits warning for the year to the end of
June, blaming election uncertainty for poor sales between Mothers' Day and
Easter.
Since then, the hot weather has also played a part, prompting chocolate
fiends to spurn their favourite treat for something more refreshing.
Mr Alan Goodwin, finance director, said Mothers' Day and Easter account for
25 per cent of annual sales and both were disappointing.
Mothers' Day was poorly promoted on the high street, and sons and daughters
may have tried to save a pound or two by trading down from Thorntons to
pre-packed chocolate boxes.
Although the election was over a week before Easter, there was a rush of
spending rather than a constant flow. This led to queues in Thorntons'
shops, and again prompted consumers to go elsewhere.
The City expected Thorntons to make pre-tax profits of about Pounds 11.5m
and the profit warning led to a 4p fall in the share price to 206p. Rowe and
Pitman, the company's stockbroker, yesterday cut its forecast to Pounds
10.4m while Panmure Gordon was going for Pounds 10m. Last year Thorntons
made Pounds 11.9m.
But it is not all doom and gloom. Thorntons' ice cream products, shipped
over from France, doubled turnover last week as Britain baked.
Unfortunately ice cream still accounts for only about 5 per cent of annual
sales, and even a hot summer will not make up for the melting chocolate
market.

FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Chrysalis calls on help from the Caped
Crusader
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PEGGY HOLLINGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHRYSALIS, the music publishing, communications and media company, is
calling on the Caped Crusader to help it return to the record business.
Mr Chris Wright, founder and chairman of the company which sold its 50 per
cent stake in a records venture to partner Thorn EMI last year, said
Chrysalis would announce the creation of a spoken word and TV advertising
record company within the next few weeks.
The company has acquired the rights to Batman, the book of the movie, to be
read aloud by a star from the film.
Mr Wright made the announcement as he revealed that Chrysalis had emerged
from the first half with sharply lower pre-tax losses of Pounds 987,000,
partly due to selling the records business stake.
The sale resulted in an extraordinary gain of Pounds 11.7m.
The chairman added that excluding the records division, the group made a
small pre-tax profit of Pounds 38,000 for the six months to February 29.
However, he warned that the company's 'aggressive' investment programme this
year would mean a loss in the second half.
The pre-tax return, compared with losses last year of Pounds 2.9m, was
struck on sales 9 per cent down at Pounds 45.7m. Again, a sharp drop in the
records business had disguised a six per cent rise in sales of on-going
operations to Pounds 38m.
Mr Wright said the music publishing business had made a small loss.
Publishing would incur heavier losses in the current half as Chrysalis
stepped up its programme to sign writers.
The fruit machines and juke box business suffered losses of just under
Pounds 1m (Pounds 1.25m).

FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Geevor blames CIBC for its 'traumatic year'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN AN emotional statement accompanying the news that Geevor, the UK mining
company with an 85-year history, suffered a net loss of Pounds 16.4m in the
year to March 1991, Mr Mark Wellesley-Wood, chairman, said the 'traumatic
year' resulted from the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce withdrawing
Geevor's banking facilities in controversial circumstances.
He said CIBC, Canada's second-largest bank, claimed in its advertising in
the mining press 'to have shared in the dreams of many entrepreneurs, large
and small. I would suggest that in Geevor's case they turned the dreams of
our shareholders into nightmares.'
Some of Geevor's institutional shareholders took up Pounds 1.25m of
convertible loan notes after CIBC's move, partly so that Geevor could pursue
the bank in the courts. Mr Wellesley-Wood reported that Geevor now had a
number of claims outstanding against its former bankers.
He said that only the support of the institutions enabled Geevor to continue
trading and that the company's new advisers, Smith New Court Finance, 'went
further than the normal call of duty in assisting me in protecting
(shareholders') interests in difficult circumstances.'
Negotiations for a reverse takeover of Geevor by a private UK company with
North American coal assets - which Mr Wellesley-Wood refused to name - have
dragged on much longer than anticipated but 'the board remains hopeful of a
successful outcome.'
Geevor has closed down or disposed of most of its operations, including its
tin mine in Cornwall, and reduced staff and board numbers to a minimum.
The pre-tax loss for the year was Pounds 12.87m compared with Pounds 1.43m.
Extraordinary items accounted for Pounds 3.5m (Pounds 4.06m) and the net
loss of Pounds 16.4m (Pounds 5.4m) equates to 48.5p a share (6.52p).
Geevor's auditors have qualified the 1991 accounts, saying they were not
able to form an opinion as to whether they showed a true and fair view.

FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Wolves &amp; Dudley rises to Pounds 16.5m in
tough market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WOLVERHAMPTON &amp; Dudley Breweries increased first half pre-tax profits 4.8
per cent to Pounds 16.52m in 'a fiercely competitive beer market.'
Mr David Thompson, managing director, estimated that beer volumes had fallen
5 per cent nationally and 9 per cent in the Midlands region during the six
months to March 29.
Trading in the Midlands had been 'extremely tough', with rising unemployment
hitting pubs on large housing estates and the take-home trade suffering from
over-stocking and discounting by national brands.
'The market is now much more sensitive to pricing,' Mr Thompson said.
'Customers are demanding value for money.'
But the group's underlying trading performance, supported by 'a remorseless
attack on costs', was strong.
Earnings grew 2.3 per cent to 17.6p, in spite of a rising tax charge. The
interim dividend is raised 4.9 per cent to 4.3p.
Trading profit rose 1 per cent to Pounds 18.05m on turnover 11.4 per cent
ahead at Pounds 101.89m.
Camerons Brewery in north-east England, acquired in January, helped Wolves
to increase beer volumes but contributed to a reduction in operating margins
from 19.5 per cent to 17.7 per cent.
Camerons would become profitable next year, Mr Thompson said. 'We now have a
production and distribution cost per barrel which is competitive  - the
essential platform on which to build sales in the free trade. Our objective
is to create a vigorous regional brewery company in the north-east and
progress so far is excellent.'
Mr Thompson said that expansion prospects appeared more favourable in the
north where land prices were lower, pub-going was fashionable, and beer
prices were higher than in the Midlands.
Wolves acquired 9 pubs and built 7 new outlets during the six months.
Further development of greenfield sites this year was expected to raise
borrowings from Pounds 59.6m to about Pounds 75m. The group sold or closed
17 pubs - 'certain pubs remain hard to let,' said Mr Thompson - but all
Camerons' tenants and 77 per cent of Wolves' tenants have now signed new
lease agreements.
Pubs in good locations continued to trade strongly. The group's Milestone
restaurants increased sales of meals 13 per cent and raised spend per head;
and Milestone taverns sold 54 per cent more meals. Profits declined,
however, at the group's hotels.

FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Ashley Group falls Pounds 6.67m into red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ASHLEY GROUP has plunged from profits of Pounds 8.01m to pre-tax losses of
Pounds 6.67m in the six months to February 29. Mr Tony Butler, chief
executive, resigned at the end of the period amid disagreements over
strategy and pressure from institutional shareholders for change.
Mr James White, chairman of the Spanish food retailing and window blind
distribution and plywood group, said: 'The period was one of considerable
difficulty,' adding that he hoped it would 'prove to have been the nadir in
the group's fortune'.
All three divisions suffered downturns and the interest charge jumped to
Pounds 2.29m (Pounds 117,000), after an increase in average net borrowings
to between Pounds 25m and Pounds 28m, caused by 'the adverse trading
results, working capital movements and the absence of anticipated property
disposals'.
The pre-tax line was further hit by a swing from exceptional credits of
Pounds 1.32m to charges of Pounds 2.81m. These comprised parent company
costs of Pounds 1.17m relating to the board's strategic review and Mr
Butler's Pounds 593,000 golden handshake, and Pounds 1.64m abnormal bad
debts and provisions for reorganisation and rationalisation in Digsa, the
Spanish food retailer. Mr White said he had thought it best to clear all the
decks at once.
He said that the changes at Digsa, bought for Pounds 30m in 1988 by Mr
Butler from his former company, Dee (later Gateway) Corporation, were about
two thirds complete. Senior management has been strengthened and Mr White
has called a halt to further acquisitions.
Two of Digsa's five regions were performing profitably, one just above
break-even and two were the cause of the divisional tumble to trading losses
of Pounds 2.79m (profits Pounds 4.09m).
Profits in the blinds distribution side fell to Pounds 1.76m (Pounds 3.06m)
and in British Plywood to Pounds 37,000 (Pounds 186,000).
Group turnover grew to Pounds 213.6m (Pounds 183.5m) with the food
distribution side accounting for Pounds 196.8m (Pounds 169.9m). Losses per
share emerged at 5.3p (earnings 4.5p) and the interim dividend is halved to
0.375p. The shares were unchanged on 29p.

<TEXT>
Sale Tilney, which has food, industrial, insurance and financial services
interests, has more than halved its pre-tax loss from Pounds 9.62m to Pounds
4.45m in the year to November 29, writes Peter Pearse.
However, Mr Andrew Coppel, group chief executive, said: 'The group's
solvency and the seriousness of the group's financial position are the main
issue for the board.' During the year that position worsened, leaving net
liabilities of Pounds 9.76m.
The order books in the industrial companies gave 'cause for concern', said
Mr Coppel. 'There remains considerable uncertainty about the overall outcome
for 1992.'
Debt was reduced to Pounds 23.3m (Pounds 27.1m) in the 12 months, shrinking
interest payable to Pounds 3.92m (Pounds 5.99m).
Exceptional losses, provisions and refinancing expenses were sharply down at
Pounds 2.7m (Pounds 8.8m). However, extraordinary charges leapt to Pounds
12.5m (Pounds 143,000), comprising Pounds 5m closure costs and Pounds 7.4m
for the transfer of goodwill written off to the merger reserve.
Group turnover was down at Pounds 128m (Pounds 153m) and losses per share
were 17.9p (36.7p).

FT  23 MAY 92 / UK Company News: The right mix for an early flotation -
Kenwood and its plans for coming to market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TIM PARKER is very anxious not to be seen as a man in hurry to make a
fortune.
Tousle-haired with footballer looks, the 36 year-old former Treasury
economist is about to bring Kenwood to the stock market a little under three
years after taking the famous maker of kitchen appliances private in a
management buy-out from Thorn EMI.
Mr Parker will, of course, make a paper fortune from the June flotation that
is likely to raise Pounds 45m-Pounds 50m. The 11 members of the buy-out team
are only selling up to 20 per cent of their stakes - enough to pay off loans
taken out for the MBO - but they will be left with about 9 per cent of a
company capitalised at about Pounds 100m.
The float will also give Kenwood access to capital markets and opportunities
to expand through acquisitions that simply would not exist with its current
level of debt.
It will rank as one of the faster and more successful exits for investors,
though considerably slower than Taunton Cider, which also floats this summer
little more than a year after the MBO.
'We have a good five-year record as a team,' says Mr Parker at modest
offices in Havant, Hampshire, that show all the signs of being run by a
cost-conscious management. 'This is not the story of any old MBO that has
cut a few costs. The flotation is not just an MBO harvesting arrangement.'
But Mr Parker accepts that Kenwood's 900 staff could lose motivation when
they read about the small management team's new found paper riches and has
spent some time addressing the issue.
All senior department heads already own options but they will be given new
packages after the float. Further down the company, staff can already
contribute to a share save scheme and Mr Parker is planning an employee
share option plan which will subscribe to up to 10 per cent of the new share
offer at the flotation price.
To varying degrees, therefore, Kenwood's employees are already along for the
ride - although only a handful are travelling first class. It has been quite
a journey, but not without its bumpy patches.
For years Kenwood had been stifled within Thorn EMI's white goods division
where, despite a strong international brand name, it was never allowed to
grow as a focused small appliances company.
The lead given by Mr Kenneth Wood, the founder and inventor of the Kenwood
Chef 45 years ago, had slowly ebbed away and companies like Braun and
Moulinex had made much of the running in developing new markets.
Mr Parker found the backing, from NatWest bank and a buy-out fund of venture
capitalist, Candover Investments. But having paid what was seen as a full
price of Pounds 56.5m, the MBO team only just hit the banks' targets,
narrowly avoiding a renegotiation which would have handed an additional
slice of equity to the financiers.
But Kenwood has bounced back with vigour. The company is now selling 200
products, where five years ago there were only 20; through designer Kenneth
Grange, who has been working with Kenwood for 31 years, the company has
developed what it calls a Kenwood look and got rid of what Mr Parker calls
the 'funny sort of raspberry colours'; and Kenwood's high overheads have
been slashed.
The results, during one of the toughest consumer recessions, speak for
themselves. Pre-tax profits in the year to March 1991 were Pounds 6.6m on
sales of Pounds 76m, up from Pounds 4.2m on sales of Pounds 66.7m the
previous year. And the prospectus is likely to report a further jump to
profits of Pounds 9.5m on sales of Pounds 92m, despite Pounds 5.5m of
interest charge.
So why float now? Why did Mr Parker not wait to enjoy the benefit of a
resurgence in consumer spending?
Mr Parker says he could have continued to soldier on with the banks. But at
4pm in the morning of April 10 this year, as it became clear that the
Conservatives had been returned to power, Mr Parker - a one time chairman of
Oxford University Labour Club - knew he should seize the moment.
Quite apart from the boost that the stock market has since enjoyed, Mr
Parker is wary of losing momentum through delay. He remembers that two weeks
after closing the deal to buy Kenwood in 1989, finance for MBOs dried up
almost overnight after Japanese banks withdrew their support for the United
Airlines buy-out.
Depending on the flotation price, Kenwood is hoping it will either repay all
of its debt or end up with a small cash balance after costs.
That price obviously depends to some extent on how much froth remains in the
London stock market over the next month.
Furthermore, Mr Parker believes it should also reflect the unusual qualities
of the company which make it such a good growth prospect.
'We are semi-unique,' he says. 'We are an international design consumer
goods company that happens to be in small kitchen appliances, and Kenwood is
an extremely well known brand internationally.'

FT  23 MAY 92 / Letter: Lloyd's Name denies not having shared risks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr JOHN DONNER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Your article, 'Tory MP Names attack Lloyd's' (May 21), mentions the
reference to me in the Commons early day motion tabled on Wednesday by Paul
Marland MP.
Although I am no longer involved in the day-to-day running of this company,
I can confirm that when I was its proprietor (up until October 1990), a
fundamental principle of the agency was that either I or my wife, also a
director of the agency, would participate on all syndicates on which our
Names were placed. This was the agency's policy from inception of the
company in 1976.
In the case of the syndicates referred to in the early day motion on which
Donner Names were placed - ie Bohling syndicates, managed by Devonshire, and
Marine Syndicate 299, managed by Gooda Walker - my own, or my wife's
involvement has meant that we have both suffered our share of the losses.
I considered it my responsibility to share the fortunes of recommendations
with Names and this policy was clearly communicated to them - indeed, many
Names found this very reassuring.
My involvement in syndicate 45 was also mentioned in the early day motion
being a syndicate I joined in the mid-1960s. I endured the major losses it
suffered when it crashed at the end of that decade. When the syndicate was
restored to profitability, I sought additional capacity for Names whose
affairs I was managing but was refused, despite the strenuous part I had
played in the syndicate's rehabilitation.
I appreciate that Mr Marland is, like myself and many other Names, suffering
personal losses at Lloyd's, but I bitterly resent that he should use his
parliamentary privilege to vent inaccurate accusations.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Letter: No one's interests are served in undermining prices
index
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr D E LEA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Leaving aside its wholly unfounded, and indeed insulting, premise, your
attack on the advisory committee on the Retail Prices Index (Leading
article, 'RPI RIP', May 21) as an anachronism 'representing vested interests
determined to get as much out of cost-of-living compensation as possible' is
hard to reconcile with the decision of your distinguished columnist Samuel
Brittan to join the committee, a decision which we would all welcome.
Let me explain why the present arrangement is still generally supported. You
say the job of determining the index should be left to the Central
Statistical Office. As CSO officials will testify, many of the points in the
handling of the RPI have benefited from non-governmental expertise.
Statistics users have confidence in the RPI: this is not unconnected with
the fact that it is seen to be free of government manipulation, unlike the
unemployment figures, to take one notable example.
Many billions of pounds of public expenditure are determined by the figure.
No one's interests are served by undermining it. So far as the TUC is
concerned, we have loyally supported all the recommendations of the advisory
committee even when we may have a preferred different result. If we are to
move towards a Euro formula in the context of European Monetary Union it
will be equally vital that the future has public support.
I look forward to hearing Samuel Brittan's advocacy of a new approach to
housing. If he has something constructive to say he will find an eqully
constructive response by members of the committee.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Letter: Not enough consideration of support for
beatification
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From F PERREAU DE PINNINCK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Robert Graham's article on the founder of Opus Dei raises more
questions than it answers ('The rush to beatify an impatient saint', May
16). He reproduces a long list of defamatory statements against Msgr
Escriva, most of them in reported speech, while giving little consideration
to the opposite arguments.
The criticisms about Msgr Escriva and Opus Dei have repeatedly been denied
not only by Opus Dei spokesmen, but also by many other people. If these
accusations were true, it would be difficult to explain why so many people
profess devotion towards Msgr Escriva and claim to have obtained graces
through his intercession. It would be particularly difficult to explain why
more than 200,000 pilgrims travelled to Rome from many parts of the world to
spend, peacefully and cheerfully, several hours under a hot sun to attend
his beatification.
If the criticisms were accurate, it would be all the more difficult to
explain how the complex procedural hurdles - including the proof of a
miracle - to beatify Msgr Escriva could have been overcome, since procedural
decisions are adopted in different steps by majority vote by committees of
diverse composition, and those criticisms were already known.
There are two different views of Msgr Escriva: that of a man of dubious
standing, and that of a saint. One of them is wrong. Should the benefit of
the doubt be in favour of the massive evidence and testimonies without which
Msgr Escriva's beatification could not be accomplished, or in favour of
critical statements coming from limited sources? In my view, the answer is
clear - unless, of course, one believes in the conspiracy theory: an almost
unlimited capacity by Opus Dei not only to manipulate the Vatican, but also
grossly to deceive its own members and sympathisers.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Theeeeere's Johnny: The talk show king is abdicating
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Kenneth Tynan should have been alive this week in America. Still, his ghost
might have the satisfaction of knowing that he was probably the most quoted
man in the country, all the words taken from an article he wrote in the New
Yorker magazine more than 14 years ago.
To everybody outside the US, this proposition will appear preposterous. What
or who could Tynan have written about in February 1978 that conceivably
could have been considered more notable in this particular week of May 1992
than, say, Ross Perot, George Bush and Bill Clinton (who want to be
president), Michael Jordan and Shaquille O'Neal (the glorious present and
future of basketball), Roger Keith Coleman (sadly strapped in the electric
chair in Virginia) or Murphy Brown (who does not even exist in real life)?
The answer is Johnny Carson, who retired last night after 29 1/2 years as
host of NBC Television's Tonight show, the grandfather of talk-show
programming. And for those who still scratch their heads and say 'who' or
'why', assuming, as they reasonably might, that there is no American
television programme that has not been exported somewhere in the world since
the invention of the medium, the second answer is that Johnny Carson is one
of those peculiar national institutions, beloved of every culture, that is
simply not very exportable: a bit like cricket, which, let's face it, is
only played in the old British empire - and, for obscure reasons, Holland.
Explaining Carson's appeal is quite difficult, which is why Tynan's article
has been so massively mined by a new generation of critics and social
commentators this week. The best of his quotes, as valid today as then,
comes from Billy Wilder, the film maker.
'By the simple law of survival, Carson is the best. He enchants the invalids
and the insomniacs as well as those who have to get up at dawn. He is the
Valium and the Nembutal of the nation. No matter what kind of dead-asses are
on the show, he has to make them funny and exciting. He has to be their
nurse and their surgeon. He has no conceit.
'He's the cream of middle-class elegance, yet he's not a mannequin. He has
captivated the American bourgeoisie without ever offending the highbrows and
he has never said anything that wasn't liberal or progressive.'
Obviously longevity on the job has added to Carson's unique place in the
national affection. He has survived seven presidents, two wars, the collapse
of the Soviet Union, assassinations and urban unrest.
Each night at 11.30pm (an hour earlier in the midwest, which is an early
closing part of the country) Americans, who have almost as many televisions
in their houses as others have lightbulbs, became accustomed to tuning in,
or out. Carson catered for both.
Already a successful quiz show host, he took over Tonight from the mercurial
Jack Paar on October 1 1962, only after several considerable luminaries of
wit, including Groucho Marx and Bob Newhart, had turned it down. Since then,
he has outlasted all the competition the other networks have thrown at him.
He has cut down a lot on the original Monday-to-Friday schedule in recent
years but the programme's trademark introduction ' Ed McMahon, the second
banana, shouting out 'Heeeeeere's Johnny' - is in the national lexicon.
The programme's formula also never varied. On comes Carson, always in a
jacket and tie, never in a suit, never an open-necked shirt, for the opening
monologue, six or seven minutes of skilled patter, with good, contemporary
one-liners provided for him by a team of script writers and always ending
with an imaginary golf swing. He would occasionally dress up as comic
characters of his own invention, a bit like the late Benny Hill, but
cleaner. The jokes might not linger but the impeccably timed deadpan comic
delivery often made them seem better than they were.
Thus, in this final week, there were good lines about Vice-President Dan
Quayle and his assault on the Murphy Brown TV character who has been the
object of his discontent ('I thought the vice-president never watched Murphy
Brown because it was up against 'F Troop' on cable').
Some have seen Carson over the years as an arbiter of political taste and
certainly his contempt for Richard Nixon over Watergate was palpable. The
safer conclusion was that if he turned his not-always-gentle barbs against a
politician, then his target was probably already in trouble.
But the principal metier was always showbiz, increasingly so after the show
moved from New York to Los Angeles in 1972. His first - and last - guest was
Tony Bennet, the singer. This year he finally induced an appearance from
Elizabeth Taylor, fetchingly dressed in black biker gear with decolletage.
There was a session with Frank Sinatra in 1976, made memorable when another
guest, the comedian Don Rickles, insisted on talking to the crooner as a
subaltern in the Mafia. The high (or low) light was the televised marriage
on a programme in 1969 of the falsetto singer Tiny Tim to Miss Vicky, which
attracted a record audience.
If Carson always remained subtly up-to-date in his material, he did age on
the job. Now 66, the thick black thatch of the 1960s has become a suitably
distinguished silver. But beyond the physically visible and the inevitable
scandal sheet coverage of earlier failed marriages, he remained a curiously
elusive figure.
Kenneth Tynan, again, summed this up best after weeks spent observing the
man at work. Talking to Carson, he wrote, was 'like addressing an
elaborately wired security system'. But perhaps, he went on, what people saw
on their screens was the real thing: 'Where other performers go home to
relax after the show, Carson goes to the show to relax - the studio is his
den, his living space.'
This den is to be inhabited shortly by his successor, Jay Leno, But, if you
believe half the tributes paid to Johnny Carson this week, the national dens
and bedrooms will be never be the same again.

<TEXT>
Sir, Miss F H McLean is stringently critical (Letters, May 16) of an
initiative by a well-known supermarket to support local schools by the issue
of vouchers exchangeable for free computer equipment.
Miss McLean's notion that this offer 'well illustrates' the partnership
between business and education - which the government is encouraging - is
both capricious and misleading. Our Mid Glamorgan Education Business
Partnership has now been in existence for over three years and has developed
very robust and extensive relationships between the local education
authority, the Welsh Office, industry and commerce, our Training and
Enterprise Council, teachers and students, and local communities.
My colleagues, mainly secondees from education and business, are involved in
delivering specific programmes to 42 comprehensive schools, nine special
schools, and many of our 350 primary schools in the county. These programmes
include enterprise development, curriculum enhancement, teacher placement
and compact. Our second annual report, for 1990-91, lists 150 local private
and public sector organisations which have provided much appreciated support
during the year. Tesco, the supermarket in question, is one of these
organisations.
At a recent three-day European conference on school/industry links at
Porthcawl, Mr David Hunt, the secretary of state for Wales, delivered a
supportive speech underlining his, and the government's, commitment to the
partnership concept as achieved in Mid Glamorgan. Derek Morgan,

FT  23 MAY 92 / Letter: Pricing for health care
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr DAVID T ERVINE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Mr Peter Reeves (Letters, May 18), in raising the question of
restructuring the private health service, proposes a change to a
pre-determined price for a full episode of treatment, so encouraging a more
rapid embracing of short-stay technologies.
In fact, the private sector already offers predetermined prices by way of
fixed cost surgery, a system first introduced by Nuffield Hospitals.
There is, however, a difficulty in making this pricing system more widely
available. This lies in a varying length of hospital stay which is usually
based on medical pre-conditions. The priority must be patients' well-being;
it may not be in their best interests if hospitals have too great an
incentive to 'turn round' patients quickly.
The private health sector has pioneered the adoption of short-stay
procedures such as keyhole surgery so as to embrace advances in technology
while maintaining its commitment to high levels of medical care. We believe
the uptake of such techniques is far greater in the private sector, perhaps
because the private sector is naturally more accustomed to adapting rapidly
to changes in consumer demand.

<TEXT>
MR MICHAEL Heseltine has taken the right decision in referring the Lloyds
Bank bid for Midland to the Monopolies Commission. Unlike the bid from
Hongkong Bank, the Lloyds offer raises competition issues which need to be
scrutinised. And since the Hongkong bid has already been cleared in
Brussels, there are no awk-ward conflicts between rival competition
authorities. The odds are tilting in Hongkong's favour, but not
overwhelmingly so. Lloyds should keep its hat in the ring.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Not a level playing field: The Premier League's potential
impact on UK football
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JANE FULLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Blackburn Rovers play Leicester City at Wembley on Monday, there will
be rather more at stake than winning the second division play-offs for a
place in the new Premier League.
The most glittering prize will be the Pounds 1.5m cash that a typical
Premier League club can expect in the first season of a Pounds 304m
five-year television deal with British Sky Broadcasting and the BBC. The
figure contrasts with the Pounds 68,000 each second division club received
this season from ITV.
The most enthusiastic advocates of the BSkyB deal are chairmen of the less
glamorous Premier League clubs. At Wimbledon, which set records for the
lowest gates in the former first division, its chairman Sam Hammam says:
'It's the difference between life and death.' The club has lost nearly
Pounds 1.8m in the past year, a gap bridged as usual by selling star
players.
He speaks with glee of an equally important gap being closed between big and
small clubs in the Premier League. Wimbledon, with an average gate of less
than 7,000 collects only Pounds 700,000 a year through the turnstiles. Last
year Manchester United, with an average attendance of 43,000, derived more
than Pounds 9m from this source.
For Wimbledon, the most crucial gain is the tele-gate. The armchair fan will
at last share the burden of financing football, first through satellite
subscription and in later seasons through the proposed pay-per-view system.
Alan Sugar, chairman of Tottenham Hotspur - and of Amstrad, which
distributes satellite dishes - conjures up a vision of 1m dish owners paying
Pounds 2 per game to deliver Pounds 120m a season, split between BSkyB and
the league. His scenario assumes that 15 per cent of 7m dish owners would
participate. At present, little more than 2m dishes are installed.
Unless more than seven people cluster around a set, the audience is bound to
be much smaller than the 7m-9m who regularly watched ITV's The Match on a
Sunday. And some commentators have said the restriction would be bad for the
game.
Those complaining about the narrow access to live football can expect robust
replies from most Premier League clubs. Ron Noades, chairman of Crystal
Palace, with which Wimbledon shares a stadium, says: 'The government is
asking us to rebuild grounds. The supporters are refusing to pay for it. Why
should we provide soccer free for millions of screen spectators who are
making no contribution to meeting the Taylor Report?'
It is estimated that meeting the report's requirement for all-seater
stadiums - a response to the Hillsborough tragedy - will cost the 22 Premier
League clubs Pounds 163m. Only a quarter of this is expected to come from
the government.
Many clubs are not in good shape to meet this commitment. According to Simon
Pitt, joint managing director of a new sports consultancy called Centre
Forward, 'English Football's total indebtedness is probably as much as
Pounds 150m.'
Against this background it might seem odd that six clubs - Manchester
United, Arsenal, Liverpool, Everton, Leeds and Aston Villa - voted against
the BSkyB deal. They are the strongest financially and their games have
dominated the coverage by ITV. Indeed David Dein, vice-chairman of Arsenal,
is seen as something of an ITV champion.
The argument put forward by the big clubs for preferring ITV was that
although BSkyB was offering about Pounds 10m a year more than ITV, this was
for 60 games compared with 30. (This season 21 matches were shown.)
There is concern not only about saturating the audience, but also about the
innovation of live games on a Monday night, regarded as being less popular
with fans than a weekend fixture. However, even for a club that did well out
of the ITV deal, the new arrangement represents a big increase in income.
Manchester United received about Pounds 700,000 from ITV this season. Under
the new deal, which includes prize money related to league position, United
would have earned the best part of Pounds 2m.
Beyond this week's auction of TV and advertising rights, there remain
nagging doubts about the destination of all this money.
If the Premier League ultimately becomes smaller and more oriented towards
European competition, English clubs would be drawn even further into the
scramble for the best players, which boils down to wages and transfer fees.
These already seem high. Established Premier League players earn up to
Pounds 3,000 a week. John Barnes, the Liverpool forward reputed to be on
Pounds 500,000 a year, is just one England international being lured abroad.
As for transfers, the record Pounds 2.9m paid by Liverpool for Dean Saunders
pales beside the Pounds 8m that recently took Jean-Pierre Papin from
Marseille to AC Milan.
While the gap has narrowed between big and small in the Premier League, a
gulf is opening up between the league and the other three divisions. Luton
Town, relegated after numerous escapes, was persuaded at the last minute to
attend Monday's meeting of Premier League chairmen, to ensure that the
little clubs had the two-thirds majority they needed in the vote for BSkyB.
Along with West Ham and Notts County, Luton will receive Pounds 750,000
compensation for missing out on the serious money.
The talks now going on between the Football League and potential
broadcasters of games from the new Divisions I to III are unlikely to yield
anything like that farewell payment from the big league.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Legal clash may harm Channel 5 prospects
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PROSPECTS of a merger between Five TV and The Entertainment Channel, both
bidders for the Channel 5 franchise, appeared to be damaged yesterday after
Five TV signalled it might continue its legal battle against TV-am.
Five TV yesterday lost its High Court action to gain an injunction
preventing TV-am from investing in The Entertainment Channel, but later
indicated that it could take the issue to a full hearing.
No hearing could be held before the July 7 deadline for franchise bids, but
the clash could reduce the chances of the consortia joining forces. Several
leading shareholders in both consortia believe high start-up costs mean that
the Channel 5 franchise will be viable only if the bid is uncontested and
the minimum Pounds 1,000-a-year bid made.
The vice-chancellor, Sir Donald Nicholls, said an exclusivity and
confidentiality clause signed by TV-am when it was shown Five TV's business
plan should not prevent it from investing in any rival Channel 5 bidder.

NAMES failed yesterday in a new bid to obtain injunctions preventing Lloyd's
from drawing down on their deposits to meet insurance losses.
At the same hearing in the High Court, Lloyd's was granted its application
to contest an earlier decision allowing the Names to apply for a judicial
review of Lloyd's.
Six Names connected with the Gooda Walker Action Group were seeking the
review and had appealed for the injunctions pending its result.
This is the second time within six weeks that Names have failed to win
injunctions preventing Lloyd's from drawing on the deposits that all Names
must lodge. Last month an application by more than 800 Names was rejected. A
third group of Names in the Distressed Names LMX Spiral Action Group is
persisting as part of a broader action.
In the US on Thursday Mr Ronald Riley won a temporary injunction in Denver,
Colorado, pending an appeal against a ruling in favour of Lloyd's.
Mr Peter Nutting has resigned as chairman of the Lloyd's Names Associations'
Working Party, which groups together representatives of action groups, after
a dispute with advocates of more militant action.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Lessons of Bombay broker's fall: India's financial markets
need more radical reform than is contemplated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOUSEGO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN India came close last year to defaulting on its foreign debt payments,
the shock to national pride precipitated the most radical change in economic
policy India has seen since independence.
Mindful of the precedent, many bankers and brokers in Bombay have been
saying this week that the nation's worst financial scandal, reducing stock
market values by almost a third from their mid-April peak and causing heavy
losses to banks, including Britain's Standard Chartered and Australia's ANZ
Grindlays could also bring radical change.
'This could be a blessing in disguise,' said one Indian broker. 'It is far
better that it has happened now rather than in three years' time,' said a
foreign banker reflecting on the potential damage to India's credibility if
the collapse had occurred when both foreign direct investment and portfolio
investment were much higher.
But such expectations of radical reform are pitched too high. The Indian
financial markets, as the traumatic events of the last three weeks have
shown, are a chaotic mixture of archaic procedures, increasingly large
trading volumes, inadequate supervision, more aggressive broking practices
and new financial instruments adapted from more sophisticated markets.
Mr Harshad Mehta, the Bombay broker now under investigation for fraudulent
securities dealings, had an Olympian grasp of these markets, the players and
the loopholes. He had learnt the hard way through defaulting in 1987.
His genius was to realise two years ago that the Indian market was headed
strongly upwards. The corporate sector could only gain from the change from
the highly regulated environment hostile to business to a more
market-oriented climate. He bought stocks like Associated Cement Corporation
(ACC) for Rs50 (Pounds 1) and helped propel them to a peak of Rsll,500 in
April.
But his ambitions overtook him. After going bust in 1987, he relaunched
himself in the government securities market where banks trade among
themselves in government and public-sector debt. As the stock market took
off, he financed forward trading in shares out of funds raised on the
collateral of bankers' receipts - an instrument used only in India, by which
a bank pledges later delivery of securities already paid for. In many cases,
the securities did not exist or had not yet been purchased.
State Bank of India, the largest bank, forced Mr Mehta to repay Rs6.2bn in
April. Badly overstretched, he raised funds from National Housing Bank on
purported bankers' receipts. A cheque for Rs3bn-Rs4bn was mistakenly
credited to his account at Grindlays.
What is now clear is that Mr Mehta was by no means alone in siphoning funds
out of the government securities market into share purchases. Banks could
face losses of Rs25bn.
As with any financial collapse, the immediate effect has been to show up the
weaknesses of the system. Both state-owned and foreign banks maintained
inadequate controls over their treasury departments, which had been a major
source of profit.
The Reserve Bank of India (the central bank) failed to keep an up-to-date
record of transactions because entries are still made by hand in the public
debt office. Bankers' receipts were transferred between banks -
notwithstanding regulations to the contrary - and banks failed to verify
their authenticity.
In the stock market, as well, abuses abound. Large companies merrily
purchase their own stock to push up prices. Insider trading is still not
illegal - though regulations are now being drawn up to forbid it. Corporate
reporting of accounts is well below international standards. The volume of
floating shares is relatively small because in many companies, the
state-owned financial institutions and the founders hold between them up to
60 per cent of the shares.
Foreigners are still not allowed to purchase shares directly in the Indian
market, though they can invest indirectly through a limited pool of shares
held by offshore funds. Dr Manmohan Singh, the finance minister, said in his
February budget he would allow 'reputable' foreign institutions to buy
directly in the Indian market. But foreigners are likely to stay out of the
market until prices - still reflecting average price/earnings ratios of 35 -
drop to a more realistic level. Foreigners will also want to see that the
abuses and those responsible for them, have been removed.
The government would like to prosecute Mr Mehta but is still uncertain if it
can substantiate its case. The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) does
not have the expertise for tackling highly complex issues in the securities
market. Mr Mehta has powerful friends among industrialists, senior civil
servants and politicians - many of whom have benefited from his dealings or
are themselves guilty of illegalities in a society where bribery is common.
Banks want their money back and know their best chance of getting it is
acquiring Mr Mehta's shares. Mr Mehta strides the town like a man who
expects a deal to be done.
The scandal will undoubtedly lead to tighter discipline in the market. Banks
will keep a closer check on their treasuries. The Reserve Bank is to
computerise its register of security transactions. Stockbrokers who before
the crash closed the stock market in protest at attempts by the newly
created Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) to force them to
register with it, have submitted this week. 'They are chastened men,' says
Mr GV Ramakrishna, the board's president.
But the real lesson of the crisis - which still paralyses the money markets
and frightens investors away from the stock market - is that financial
markets need far more radical changes than the government is contemplating.
It refused last year to privatise state owned banks, which would have made
them operate on a commercial basis.
The government is now in a dispute with the World Bank over the Bank's
demand for big cuts in state directed lending through the banking system - a
dispute which has led to the freezing of Dollars 500m World Bank financial
sector loan. It is nervous of pressing banks to cut their surplus labour
because of union opposition. In the capital markets, it is still
heavy-handedly intervening through state owned institutions to prop up
prices - to protect the small investor but also to increase the government's
revenue from planned Rs30bn-Rs40bn sales of minority stakes in public sector
enterprises.
Unluckily for the cause of radical change, the securities scandal has
occurred when the prime minister is in a weak position. The momentum of
economic reform has slowed as he has been forced to deal with challenges
from within his party. More than ever he is seeking consensus rather than
confrontation. This is an attitude bound to colour the government's handling
of the scandal.

THE US is to end or reduce operations at another 61 military sites in Europe
and two in South Korea, the Pentagon announced yesterday, Reuter reports
from Washington.
The cuts are part of a continuing reduction in the US military presence
overseas. They take to 559 the number of overseas bases at which operations
will be ended, reduced or placed on standby as Washington slashes its
defence budget now the Cold War is over. All but 35 are in Europe.
The Pentagon gave no time frame for the latest cuts.
In Europe, they will result in reductions of more than 6,000 US troops and
800 US civilian and 2,500 local jobs in Britain, Germany, Greece, Turkey,
Belgium, Italy, the Netherlands and Spain.
In South Korea, forces will be reduced at Camp Ames north of Taejon, and
ended at Songso, west of Taegu, with the departure of 246 US troops.
In the UK the main cuts involved the end of US operations at RAF Burtonwood
in Warrington, and the closure of naval communication operations around
Thurso, Scotland.
Sites in Germany affected by Friday's announcement included Peden Barracks
in Wertheim, which will close, and Pond Barracks in Amberg and Robinson
Barracks in Stuttgart, which are reducing operations.

GERMAN politicians are braced this weekend for further evidence of a rising
extreme right-wing protest vote in local government elections in Berlin,
writes Quentin Peel in Bonn.
In the first city-wide elections since 1946, more than 2.5m voters from East
and West Berlin will elect tomorrow 23 district councils, and opinion polls
suggest that the far-right Republicans could win more than 10 per cent of
the vote.
Leaders of all the big parties have been campaigning in Berlin, in an
extraordinary demonstration of the importance they attach to the outcome.
They fear a combination of an acute housing shortage, rising rents and
prices, unemployment in the former east Germany, and an influx of
foreigners, could encourage support for the far right.

FT  23 MAY 92 / Airbus to market new twin-engine airliner
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL BETTS, Aerospace Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AIRBUS Industrie, the European aircraft consortium, has been given the
go-ahead by its supervisory board to start marketing a new 124-seater
airliner, the first step towards its new airliner programme.
The consortium hopes to secure enough orders for the new twin-engine jet,
the A319, the smallest in the Airbus aircraft family, to launch the Dollars
275m (Pounds 155m) programme to develop it later this year.
The new aircraft would be a shorter derivative of the 150-seater A320
twin-engine aircraft. The consortium is already manufacturing a stretched
180-seater version of this aircraft, the A321.
It is expected to be assembled at Hamburg together with the A321, although
France has expressed concern over its share of the work on the A319 if the
airliner was assembled and completed in Germany.
Although the A319 is likely to compete against some of the separate regional
jet programmes of the Airbus partners, Mr Jean Pierson, Airbus managing
director, argued that the new aircraft would enhance the competitive
position of Airbus against its two main rivals, Boeing and McDonnell Douglas
of the US.
The A319 is expected to enter service in late 1995.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRANCE and Germany yesterday supported the early enlargement of the European
Community to include members of the European Free Trade Association, and
urged that membership negotiations should start as soon as possible.
At the end of a two-day summit in La Rochelle, President Francois Mitterrand
and Chancellor Helmut Kohl said their two governments welcomed the
candidacies of those Efta countries - Austria, Sweden and Finland - which
have applied to join the Community.
They said these countries had shown they were willing to accept the
Community as it is and to join member states in their progress towards the
European union, as set out in the Treaty of Maastricht.
They were convinced that the membership of these countries would reinforce
the European Union, economically and politically.
The two leaders also formalised their decision to set up a joint
Franco-German corps of some 35,000 men, which would be operational in 1995.
They said the new unit would contribute to giving the European Union its own
military capacity, and called on the other members of the nine-nation
Western European Union defence grouping to join the new European corps.
Mr Mitterrand said Belgium, Luxembourg and Spain had shown interest in
taking part in the corps. French officials expect an early decision by
Belgium and Luxembourg, but say the Spanish military are more cautious.
The two leaders rejected criticisms from some US officials that the new
corps would undermine the Atlantic Alliance.
'No one who follows the question seriously can have any worries,' said Mr
Kohl. 'The Americans have been telling us for years that we should build
Europe, including defence and security. It is clear that the new corps is an
addition to the alliance.'
The French and German leaders also made clear that they were determined to
press ahead with the Maastricht blueprint for European union, regardless of
the result of the Danish referendum on June 2. Some recent opinion polls
have suggested that the Danish electorate could reject the Maastricht
Treaty, which could create a legal problem.
The two governments also agreed to undertake a joint high-speed rail network
which would link Paris to Berlin and beyond, eventually reaching Vienna,
Budapest and Moscow. French ministers hope the link will be built around
2000.

THE US Coast Guard has stated that it intercepted 1,635 Haitian boat-people
on Tuesday  - a record number of such refugees picked up by the service in
any one day on the high seas, AP reports from San Juan, Puerto Rico.
In the picture above, a Haitian girl and compatriots wait aboard a Coast
Guard ship at the US naval base of Guantanamo, in south-eastern Cuba, to be
processed by the authorities.
The base now holds some 12,000 Haitian refugees and there are fears that it
will be able to admit no more.
People are fleeing Haiti at unprecedented rates. A record 10,104 refugees
were intercepted by the service in May.
The Coast Guard has intercepted 33,690 Haitian asylum-seekers bound for the
US since September 30 last year, when the Haitian army overthrew the elected
President Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
In the Haitian capital of Port-au-Prince, meanwhile, the government late on
Wednesday condemned the Organisation of American States for having adopted
tougher economic sanctions, which the army-backed administration claimed
would starve Haitians.

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE UNITED Nations will run out of cash by the end of this month unless
member states substantially reduce their debts, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, UN
secretary-general, warned last night. At Dollars 1.093bn, these exceed the
entire regular budget for 1992.
The arrears level, including peace-keeping expenses, has virtually doubled
in the past six months, to Dollars 1.898bn, he said.
In this period, the UN has mounted the peace-keeping operation in
Yugoslavia, estimated to cost more than Dollars 600m, and its biggest-ever
operation, in Cambodia, where the bill may exceed Dollars 2bn.
Also, the UN General Assembly will meet today to consider the adoption of an
additional assessment for peace-keeping in Colombia and El Salvador,
estimated at Dollars 637m.
Reflecting a trend of growing reliance on the UN since east-west divisions
were largely healed, no fewer than 13 peace-keeping operations had been
launched since 1989, equalling the total for the previous 45 years.
The main cash contributors are in recession and none of the operations has
been adequately funded. The UN has had repeatedly to rob Peter to pay Paul
by borrowing among different accounts. Only 14 out of 175 member countries
are fully paid up.
The US now owes Dollars 555m for the regular budget and Dollars 308m for
peace-keeping. Russia's arrears total Dollars 341m in the two categories and
are unlikely to be reduced soon, given Moscow's financial problems.
Mr Boutros Ghali is under pressure from Washington to cut costs to the bone
and reduce staff.
Morale in the UN secretariat is at an all-time low even as the
organisation's prestige has soared.
Adding to the staff's fears, McKinsey, the management consultancy, has
quietly begun a study of UN administrative practices. This seems to be at
the behest of Mr Dick Thornburgh, US former attorney-general and now in
charge of administration and management in the secretariat.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Donors to draw up plan for aid to CIS
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTHONY ROBINSON, East Europe editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN aid donors and senior officials from the independent states of the
former Soviet Union will seek to draw up a structured approach to technical
and other assistance during a conference in Lisbon this weekend.
The ministerial meeting, organised by the European Community, is a follow-up
to the US-organised donors conference held in Washington last January to
co-ordinate emergency humanitarian aid. Since the original meeting aid worth
another Dollars 9bn has been added to the Dollars 77bn then pledged by over
50 donor countries.
Over 70 per cent of the total aid and credit commitment has come from EC
countries, with the biggest share from Germany.
Since the original meeting the Group of Seven industrial countries, together
with the International Monetary Fund and other institutions, has put
together a Dollars 24bn aid package for Russia, including a Dollars 6bn
rouble stabilisation fund and all the former Soviet states have become
members of the International monetary Fund and the World Bank.
In Washington, donors agreed to set up working groups to co-ordinate
technical assistance and provide practical assistance in key areas such as
energy, agriculture, health and housing. Priority areas for assistance
include help to make safe Soviet-designed nuclear power stations throughout
the region.
The conference will be an opportunity for the smaller republics in
particular to make a pitch for long-term assistance needed to help them
re-adjust to life without the subsidies of the former Soviet structure.
The atmosphere for this first formal dialogue between former Cold War
enemies in their new roles as donors and aid recipients is expected to be
further lightened by the signature of a Strategic Arms Reduction (Start)
protocol by Mr James Baker, the US secretary of state, and foreign ministers
from the four CIS nuclear states  - Russia, Belarus, Kazakhstan and Ukraine.

FT  22 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Market falters but holds above 2,700
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVE THOMPSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AN increasingly tired equity market managed to close above the 2,700 level
on the FT-SE 100 Index but not without a considerable struggle. Ending the
day 9.9 lower at 2,702.0, the Footsie stocks attracted just enough support
very late in the day to drag the index up from the day's low of 2,697.8,
reached just after a weak opening by Wall Street.
The market was looking extremely uncertain at the close, with leading
traders said to be increasingly worried about the short-term outlook for
Wall Street. The US market had been hoping for a cut in discount rate.
There was very little excitement in the market at the outset, with no
evidence of any of the much-rumoured number of so-called 'mega deals'. And
there were wry smiles around the dealing desks at the absence of the Kuwait
Investment Office/BP/Hanson deal widely rumoured to have been in the
pipeline. BP lost ground yesterday, with turnover failing to reach 4m
shares. The buying of BP on Wednesday was described by one old hand in the
market as 'low quality'.
Fund managers paid only minor heed to the latest batch of economic news,
which included money supply figures and bank and building society lending
for April. Economists apparently took a second look at the sharp increase in
the bank lending figure but they were not unduly troubled by the money
supply data.
Lingering fears remained that a sizeable rights issue may be in the offing.
However, traders said the Friday before a bank holiday was not the ideal day
for a big issue.
Much of the early trading was taken up by company news items. An early slide
by BT shares, after the group revealed its first annual reduction in
profits, was arrested and then reversed as telecoms specialists came away
reassured from the post-figures meeting with the company. A number of
previously bearish analysts were said to have adopted a much more positive
stance on the shares. Combined turnover in BT 'old' and 'new' was easily the
heaviest in the market.
Banks remained in the limelight, with European Commission clearance of
Hongkong and Shanghai Banking's bid for Midland Bank the trigger for more
buying of Midland shares. Insurer Prudential was the best individual
performer in the Footsie, responding to rather unlikely takeover stories
involving Lloyds Bank.
Standard Chartered shares, on the other hand, were given a rough ride by the
market after news that losses in securities trading by its Bombay branch
have prompted Standard to make a Pounds 50m provision.
Turnover in equities just managed to top the 500m mark, reaching 505.7m
shares. Dealers were said to be slightly surprised that customer business on
Wednesday had easily exceeded Pounds 1bn, amounting to Pounds 1.2bn. Much of
yesterday's activity, however, was made up of non-Footsie stocks,
indicating, dealers said, that the big institutions were not heavily
involved in the day's business.
Food retailing was one of the worst performing sectors, after the
re-emergence of stories that a price war between the big supermarket groups
is on the horizon.

FT  22 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: BT shrugs off profits decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN, CHRISTOPHER PRICE and JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FULL-YEAR results from BT were generally well received in spite of showing
the company's first-ever drop in profits. The figures came in just below
most market forecasts but the maintained dividend and better than expected
news on restructuring costs helped the shares rebound from an initial fall.
The fully-paid closed 8 up at 360p and the partly-paid 7 1/2 ahead at 138
1/2 p, in turnover of 12m and 31m respectively.
Few fresh details of BT's business emerged from the analysts' meeting, which
one described as 'thoroughly ordinary'. However, there were firm hints that
the management was confident of strong dividend growth. Lower than expected
redundancy provisions were also welcomed.
Analysts remained divided over the group's prospects. Regulatory worries
head the list of concerns, although most agree that the shares are
relatively cheap and are likely to attract attention in the short-term.
County NatWest reiterated its positive stance, while James Capel, which had
been a seller, declared itself more positive. Most brokers shaved their
forecasts back to around Pounds 2.95bn for the current year and Pounds 3.3bn
for next year.
Lasmo retreats
Oil exploration company Lasmo once again suffered the biggest percentage
fall among the 100 FT-SE index constituents as analysts continued to remind
investors of the question marks hanging over the group's earnings. The
shares closed 7 off at 192p after 4.1m traded, having been 11 down at one
stage.
The effect of SG Warburg Securities' hefty forecast dividend cut on Tuesday
was still overhanging the stock and County NatWest told clients yesterday:
'The only real support for the shares comes from the net asset value of 192p
and the recurrent bid speculation.'
Societe Generale Strauss Turnbull also reiterated its sell recommendation on
Lasmo in its general monthly review of the oil sector.
Talk in the market that Lloyds Bank might bid for Prudential if it fails in
its approach for Midland Bank was said to be behind the strength in the life
insurer.
Prudential was up 7 at 268p against the market with 3.5m traded. Analysts
were wary of the story, pointing out that Lloyds already had two life
companies and did not need another. However, Prudential also benefited from
encouraging new business figures released yesterday.
Lloyds fell 9 to 430p in reaction to news that the Office of Fair Trading
had referred its possible bid for Midland Bank to the Department of Trade
and Industry. Meanwhile, the European Commission approved Hongkong and
Shanghai Banking's bid for Midland, which held firm at 399p on good turnover
of more than 8.1m shares.
A Pounds 50m provision by Standard Chartered against possible illegal
transactions in its Bombay branch prompted analysts to sharply downgrade
1992 profits forecasts and the shares lost 5 to 511p.
Smith New Court lowered its estimate to Pounds 230m from Pounds 265m and
Robert Fleming Securities came down to Pounds 205m from Pounds 255m, while
BZW is considering a similar reduction from its Pounds 250m forecast.
Discount house and financial services group Gerrard &amp; National gained 18 to
320p on announcing pleasing results and a higher final dividend.
The foods sectors stayed under a cloud, with the unfounded threat that a
price war in the retail area was imminent depressing many of the leading
stocks. J. Sainsbury, which had been the rumoured instigator as the story
surfaced late on Wednesday, was said to have denied the talk.
Among food manufacturers, Hillsdown slipped 6 to 180p, Tate &amp; Lyle 5 to
400p, Unigate 7 to 360p and United Biscuits 4 1/2 to 400 1/2 p. In the
retailing sector, Argyll Group shed 6 to 351p, Kwik Save 9 to 616p,
Sainsbury 7 to 458p and Tesco 6 to 274p.
Financial worries continued to overhang Eurotunnel, which ended 11 lower at
370p in thin trade. A sizeable retreat was also recorded in Paris.
Transport Development Group lost 7 to 298p after the resignation of the
chief executive of the group's French subsidiary. Profit-taking after the
recent run sent NFC down 3 to 279p. Forth Ports added 7 at 166p, with Smith
New Court said to be positive on the stock. Demand for P &amp; O continued, the
shares firming a penny to 545p.
William Cook dropped 47 to 283p after reporting full-year profits of Pounds
4.7m, sharply down from last year's Pounds 12.2m.
Cookson Group moved up 3 to 160p ahead of today's annual meeting.
Fisons was volatile in an otherwise lifeless pharmaceuticals sector as a
spate of highly dubious rumours circulated. The shares were up 9 in the
morning as speculation of takeover bids from ICI or Hanson, and of approval
for its Opticrom and Tilade drugs, did the rounds. However, the rumours were
eventually discounted and the stock fell to close a net 7 down at 359p.
After a weak spell over the past couple of days, Wellcome recovered 10 to
977p as the shares were marked up on very little turnover. There was no
relief for ICI shares, however, which receded 13 to 1347p.
SmithKline Beecham firmed 3 to 870p after announcing that its new Relafen
drug had taken 5.6 per cent of US anti-arthritic prescription sales in its
first two months on the market.
Packaging group Bunzl put on 3 to 117p following a cautious annual
statement. Dolphin Packaging lost 15 to 134p after a profits warning, while
Ferry Pickering dipped 5 to 115p, reflecting halved interim profits.
Full-year results from Storehouse came in at the top end of expectations,
which together with an upbeat presentation, saw the shares climb 3 to 140p
on 5.8m traded.
County NatWest is looking for Pounds 26m in the current year, and Pounds 40m
in 1993 - although analyst Ms Kimlan Cooke warned of 'a very long haul' for
the BhS and Habitat group.
A big buyer in search of First Leisure stock forced the price up 7 to 336p.
A Pounds 150m disposal by Automated Security lifted the shares 18 to 144p
and prompted a buy note from BZW.
Textiles and electronics group S. Jerome forged ahead 14 to 69p after the
chairman announced at the annual meeting that demand was above the previous
year's level. Parkland, which covers a similar area of business, basked in
the optimism, advancing 7 to 180p.

FT  22 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow retreats as Fed dashes
rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
US SHARE prices lost ground yesterday as hopes for an interest rate cut
diminished on reports that the Federal Reserve had decided against easing
monetary policy, writes Patrick Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 15.13 off at 3,378.71. The Standard
&amp; Poor's 500 slipped 2.79 to 412.60, the Nasdaq composite shed 1.19 to
579.10 and the Amex composite eased 0.52 to 391.63.
Turnover on the New York SE totalled 184.8m shares, and declines outnumbered
rises by about two-to-one.
The catalyst for the early losses was a newspaper report that the Fed's
policy-making open market committee had agreed at its regular monthly
meeting earlier this week not to cut interest rates immediately. Share
prices have been buoyed in recent weeks by hopes that the Fed would lower
rates to give the sluggish recovery a final push-start, but the report
suggests that any easing of policy will have to wait until after publication
of the May employment report on June 5.
Market sentiment was also damaged by the weekly jobless claims data, which
showed a 10,000 decline in the number of people claiming state unemployment
insurance during the first full week of May. The figures, while indicating
an improvement in labour market conditions, also reduced the chances of an
interest rate cut.
US Shoe dropped Dollars 2 1/8 to Dollars 12 5/8 in turnover of 1.46m shares
after reporting first-quarter profits below those of a year ago and warning
that second-quarter earnings would also be down on the equivalent period of
1991.
Among financials, Morgan Stanley fell Dollars 1 5/8 to Dollars 50 3/4 in
active trading after the investment bank reported net income of Dollars 139m
for the three months ended March 31. The company, which has just changed to
a January 31 year from a calendar year, said global sales and trading
activity remained strong, but below the record levels achieved a year ago.
In the same sector, Salomon declined Dollars 1 1/8 to Dollars 32 3/8 ,
giving up some of the gain earned on Wednesday when the US Attorney
announced that the securities house would not face criminal charges in
connection with the bond trading scandal which erupted in August last year.
Salomon was, however, ordered to pay Dollars 290m fines and compensation to
settle civil charges related to the scandal.
On the Nasdaq market, Amgen rose Dollars 1 3/4 to Dollars 59 in turnover of
1.7m shares after chief executive Mr Gordon Binder said he was comfortable
with analysts' estimates that the group's sales this year will reach Dollars
1bn.
Canada
THE Toronto market followed Wall Street lower in moderately active trading.
The composite index ended 23.2 down at 3,358.0 and falls outpaced rises by
354 to 221 after volume of 28.7m shares.
Twelve of the 14 sub-groups lost ground, with declines of at least 1 per
cent shown by financial services, consumer products and mining.
Hudson's Bay, up CDollars  1/4 at CDollars 30 1/8 , said it narrowed its
first-quarter loss to CDollars 4.5m from the CDollars 23.1m recorded a year
earlier.

FT  22 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets: Third world hopes follow strong growth
 -Antonia Sharpe on emerging markets, marked outperformers for the past
eight years
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANTONIA SHARPE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
After the phenomenal growth in emerging stock markets since the mid-1980s,
particularly in Latin America, it is understandable that some fund managers
might feel they have missed the boat.
Argentina, which grew by 392.5 per cent in dollar terms last year, has put
on a further 25 per cent so far this year, while Hong Kong, widely regarded
as a proxy for China's untold economic potential, has risen by 33 per cent
in local terms since the beginning of January, reaching record levels in the
process.
However, Citibank analysts believe the party is far from over. In their
view, emerging markets still offer investment opportunities in the 1990s and
are an increasingly important component in reducing risk in global equity
portfolios.
Mr Arnab Banerji, director of the emerging markets group at Citibank Global
Asset Management, says the best returns are to be found in developing
countries where the application of technology, government commitment to
education and the elimination of price distortion together produce steady
economic growth.
Mr Banerji told a group of fund managers in Amsterdam last week: 'In the
third world, notwithstanding the poverty, the growth rate is faster than in
developed countries . . . as they attempt to catch up.'
He added that since the collapse of the Berlin Wall, many developing
countries have accepted that price distortion - in the form of state
subsidies, excessive government regulation, or barriers to trade - hinders
economic growth and that central planning does not realise the economy's
full potential.
Furthermore, the effect of technological advancement on economic growth seen
in the 'Tiger' nations of south-east Asia is now being duplicated in Latin
America, and at a faster pace. In most of these countries, this development
has been facilitated by the existence of an educated workforce.
Examples of where the three factors of transfer of know-how, literacy, and a
reduction in price distortion are evident include India, Brazil, Argentina
and Pakistan. However, Mr Banerji warns that equity returns from these
countries are likely to be more volatile than those from Chile, Mexico or
Malaysia, where the stock markets are more established.
Dutch institutions have been at the forefront of investing in emerging
markets. But Mr Marinus Keyzer, chief economist for Pensioenfonds PGGM, the
second largest pension fund in Europe, recalls that his enthusiasm was not
shared by all in the mid-1980s.
At the time, sceptics said it would be kinder to hand out the money directly
to the poor since they were unlikely to see any of it back.
Since 1984 to April this year, however, total returns from emerging markets
have far exceeded those from stock markets in developed countries. For
example, total returns on the Latin America index of the International
Finance Corporation, part of the World Bank, have reached 840.4 per cent in
dollar terms, while the Asia index has produced total returns of 347.2 per
cent. This compares with 320.3 per cent for the MSCI World index and 317.3
per cent for the MSCI United States index.
The only continent not to have joined in this development is sub-Saharan
Africa, where a series of natural and man-made disasters have led to a
severe contraction in economic growth while the population has continued to
grow.
Fears of over-population or failure to grow enough food are not justified
elsewhere, because an increase in wealth, education and urbanisation has led
to a rapid decline in fertility rates and per capita food production has
grown.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar continues recovery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES BLITZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DOLLAR continued to recover against the D-Mark in European trading
yesterday as dealers dismissed the possibility of an imminent cut in
interest rates by the Federal Reserve, writes James Blitz.
The Fed's decision on Wednesday night not to signal a cut in the Fed Funds
rate continued to strengthen dollar bulls. So, too, did the decision by the
Bundesbank's council meeting yesterday not to lift German rates, thus
avoiding a widening of the already large differential between the two
countries' rates.
Another boost to the dollar came from a report in the Asian Wall Street
Journal, which suggested that the Fed had ended the bias towards easing held
in its directives since last August. One London-based analyst said it was
hard to believe that any member of the Federal Open Markets Committee would
leak such information to the press, but admitted that the net result of the
story was to strengthen the dollar.
Compounding all this was the weekly US unemployment claims figure, which was
down 18,000 on the week at 406,000. As a result the US currency ended more
than a pfennig up in London at DM1.6140, after a previous close of DM1.6020.
Against the yen, the dollar finished at Y130.20, after ending at Y129.65 the
night before. In New York the US unit rose further to DM1.6167 and Y130.29.
Although it had appreciated in overnight trading, sterling slipped in
European dealings yesterday as traders suspected that the Bank of England
had shown a more accommodative stance in its money market operations.
Treasury and Bank of England officials have repeatedly stressed that a
near-term rate reduction is unlikely. But the market seems to have reacted
bearishly to the Bank's decision to take out a Pounds 1.3bn shortage early
in its operations. The pound finished the day unchanged at DM2.9325.
The Italian lira slipped towards the floor of the European exchange rate
mechanism's currency grid as operators fretted about Italy's seemingly
endless rounds of voting for a new president. The political instability has
increased concern that action will not be taken to tackle a huge budget
deficit.
The lira fell one place to second from bottom of the EMS grid. The D-Mark
ended at L753.30, up from L752.50.
An analyst suggested yesterday that the market's uncertainty about the lira
may be exacerbated by nervousness about the Danish referendum on European
Monetary Union, which is due on June 2. The analyst said some dealers fear
that if the Danes decide not to join the EMU, the whole project will start
to fall apart, adding to uncertainty in the European Monetary System.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Money Markets: Rates end lower
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
RATES IN the sterling money markets finished lower yesterday after the Bank
of England forecast a large shortage that was quickly taken out in the
morning.
The Bank forecast a shortage of Pounds 1.3bn at the start of the day and, in
the early round, purchased Pounds 250m of Band-1 Bank bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, and Pounds 1.05bn of bills for resale to the market in equal amounts
on June 9 and 10 at an interest rate of 9 15/16 per cent.
The speed with which the shortage was eliminated took a number of dealers by
surprise. One money market analyst suggested that, not so long ago, the
Bank's stance yesterday might have been seen as accommodative, and
signalling a base rate cut.
However, recent comments from the deputy governor of the Bank of England and
the chancellor of the exchequer make this hard to believe. Most dealers
spoken to yesterday felt that the Bank was, at the very most, showing that
it was happy with rates at the current levels. Others said that the speed
with which the shortage was removed was part of the well-tried strategy of
pushing the overnight rate down as far as possible before a bank holiday
weekend.
Everything from three-month money to one-year ended the day at 9 15/16 per
cent, down  1/16 on the day. The overnight rate closed sharply down, at 9
1/2 per cent having ended at 12 3/4 per cent the previous day. At one stage
of the day it was as low as 8 per cent.
In the afternoon, the Bank's forecast was revised to a shortage of Pounds
1.45bn before taking account of the morning operations. In the afternoon the
Bank purchased Pounds 58m of Band-1 bank bills at 9 7/8 per cent.
There was less activity in the sterling futures market. The June short
sterling contract closed at 90.04 per cent, up 6 ticks on the day. The
closing price indicates that the market believes three-month LIBOR in
mid-June will be at 9.96 per cent. The September contract ended at 90.34, up
three ticks. The closing price suggests that the market thinks three-month
LIBOR in September will be at 9.66 per cent.
In Germany, call money rates were easier yesterday due to high levels of
reserves held on deposit at the Bundesbank. But traders said that the
decline in overnight rates, which were quoted at 9.45-55 per cent yesterday,
was chiefly due to technical factors.

COCOA prices tumbled in both London and New York. London's July contract set
a fresh 16-year low of Pounds 552 a tonne before closing at Pounds 554.
London traders were unable to define a specific reason for the fall. 'There
wasn't even any clear sign of Ivorian selling today. Perhaps it's just
boredom or perhaps people are selling in anticipation of Ivory Coast coming
back into the market again in the middle of next week,' one London trader
said. New York analysts pointed to the upwardly revised forecast for Ivorian
production this season from trade house Gill &amp; Duffus, which sent prices
lower on Wednesday. London robusta COFFEE ended mixed, while New York
arabicas saw choppy trade in the morning. The New York market ignored
reports that Brazil and Colombia had signed a coffee pact. This meant,
however, that a Brazilian denial of the report also had little effect. On
the LME TIN prices ended lower after coming under late kerb pressure from
selling and profit taking prompted by an earlier rise to a fresh 19-month
high. Trading in the other metals was generally routine. In Chicago fund
selling pushed MAIZE and SOYABEAN prices down in early trading.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Ministers near to final
agreement at Opec talks
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   VIENNA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MINISTERS of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries said
yesterday they were close to an agreement on oil production levels for the
third quarter which they hoped to finalise in a meeting this morning.
Mr Yousif Omeir bin Yousef, the United Arab Emirates oil minister and
present Opec president, said last night: 'We hope the meeting will end
tomorrow.'
Ministers, who held an extended series of bilateral meetings until late
yesterday, offered no figure for a third quarter production ceiling, but any
agreement reached today is likely to entail a rise in overall output to
accommodate increasing Kuwaiti production at least.
Ministers spent yesterday whittling down differences between Saudi Arabia,
which entered the meeting arguing that the Opec ceiling should rise by 1m
barrels a day, to 24m b/d and Iran, which said it would accept no rise in
the ceiling.
Mr Gholamreza Aghazadeh, Iran's oil minister who entered the summit saying
he wanted to see a cut in output to boost prices, said last night he hoped a
deal would be struck today, but that Iran, nevertheless, 'does not accept to
increase the ceiling'.
However, Mr Jibril Aminu, Nigeria's oil minister, suggested that no Iranian
caveat need obstruct a final agreement, pointing out that Iran also
registered its non-acceptance of Opec's second quarter ceiling of 22.98m
b/d, agreed in February. 'They said so (that they did not accept the figure)
last time, so if they said it again, it is not surprising,' Mr Aminu said.
The agreement is likely to embrace a rise in Kuwaiti production from its
presently claimed 930,000 b/d to an average of 1.2m b/d. Saudi Arabia gave
no indication of whether its output, presently at 8.02m b/d, would change.
Mr Aminu's sole comment on the shape of a possible agreement was that Opec
would take the cartel's previous deal and 'modify this according to previous
quotas and developments in the industry'.
Most analysts estimate that the call on Opec oil is likely to rise in the
third quarter, perhaps to as high as 24.4m b/d, and skirt 25m b/d by the
fourth quarter. Actual production over the second quarter has exceeded the
nominal February agreement by just over 500,000 b/d, according to industry
estimates.
Analysts suggested that a deal today could see Opec pumping between 23.7m
b/d and 24m b/d.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Government Bonds: US Treasuries depressed after report on
interest rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK, LONDON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A NEWSPAPER report that Federal Reserve policy makers had decided against an
immediate cut in short-term interest rates depressed US Treasury market
prices across the maturity range yesterday.
In late trading the benchmark 30-year government bond was down  21/32 at 101
15/32 , yielding 7.866 per cent. Prices were even lower at the shorter end
of the range, with the seven-year note down  29/32 at 99 1/2 , yielding
7.079 per cent, and the two-year note down  7/32 at 99 9/16 , yielding 5.342
per cent.
New York trading opened weaker in the wake of a Wall Street Journal story
that Tuesday and Wednesday's meeting of the policy-making Fed Open Market
Committee had decided not to cut interest rates. Prices had risen steadily
in the past few days on hopes of a policy ease, but analysts now believe a
rate cut is unlikely until the Fed has a clearer idea of the state of the
recovery.
The day's only economic data reinforced the downward pressure on prices,
with weekly jobless claims falling 20,000 to 406,000 for the first full week
of May. In the afternoon, the Treasury's sale of Dollars 10.26bn in
five-year notes was reportedly well received at an average yield of 6.75 per
cent.
UK government bond prices retained a positive tone yesterday, encouraged by
money supply figures which showed an increase in bank lending during April.
On the London futures and options exchange, the June gilt futures contract
opened at 99.23 and moved within a tight 99.26 to 99.18 range in low trading
volumes. By the close the contract stood at 99.19. Volume was 25,000
contracts.
In the cash market, long-dated gilts pushed higher during the morning
session but settled back to close little changed on the day. For example,
the 9 per cent gilt maturing 2011 opened at 101 5/16 , rose to 101 13/32 in
the day but fell back to close at 101 11/32 for a yield of 8.85 per cent.
Money supply figures for April showed bank and building society lending
rising by Pounds 5.1bn, the highest monthly total since October last year.
The figures were taken as encouraging by the market.
GERMAN government bond trading was light as the market waited for the
release of money supply data for April, which could determine the direction
of interest rates.
The benchmark 8 per cent Unity bond maturing January 2002 closed at 100.18,
from 100.38 on Wednesday, for a yield of 7.96 per cent. The price was
depressed by the announcement that the Bundesbank had added DM4bn to the
issue, which will be sold into the market when conditions are right.
On Liffe, the June bund future closed at 87.70, from an opening level of
87.74. Volume was a sluggish 35,000 contracts.
The yield spread between the French and German markets remained little
changed, at around 59 basis points at the 10-year maturity. However, the
strength of international support for the French market was yesterday
evident from the results of an auction of two-year and five-year notes. The
French treasury offered FFr12.8bn stock but received bids for over FFr50bn -
many from international investors.
SWISS government bonds lost around  1/2 a point yesterday as investors
nervously waited for the results of the federal authorities' first regular
monthly bond auction, due to be announced today.
The government is hoping to sell SFr700m of new paper, although poor market
conditions have hampered the auction which began on Monday.
At the opening yesterday, dealers were quoting the new 6 3/4 per cent 2003
bonds in the grey market at 99.20, for a yield of 6.92 per cent. By the
close the grey market price had retreated to 98.75, for a yield of 6.92 per
cent.
JAPANESE government bond prices eased slightly overnight in Tokyo, although
the market took its tone from US Treasury bonds in the absence of new
domestic factors.
The benchmark 10-year government bond issue No 129 closed on a yield of 5.49
per cent, from 5.46 per cent at the opening.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Capital questions for EC
investment - Current talks could lay the foundation for Europe's securities
industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD WATERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SERIES of intensive discussions over the next two and a half weeks could
lay the foundations for the future structure of the securities industry in
Europe. The subject: the amount of capital needed by investment firms in the
EC.
After four years of debate, Commission staff led by Sir Leon Brittan, the EC
Commissioner responsible, finally put a compromise to EC ministers earlier
this week. If all goes well, ministers will be asked to give their formal
approval on June 9.
The rules in the proposed Capital Adequacy Directive will apply both to
non-bank investment firms (including the investment subsidiaries of banks),
and to banks' 'trading books' - the part of theirbalance sheet on which they
conduct their investment business.
Divisions between member states remain, though. Reservations expressed at
Tuesday's meeting revealed a number of important areas which are still open
to debate. They include:
How much capital should firms have to back their large exposures? Previous
proposals would have prevented investment firms from taking on exposures of
more than 25 per cent of their capital base - effectively restricting
underwriting and block trading of securities to large well-capitalised
banks.
The compromise put forward this week will do away with this so-called 'hard
limit', though it will introduce severe capital rules for large positions,
particularly those which remain on an investment firm's books for longer
than 10 days. This compromise still concerns some member states where
investment business is dominated by large, well-capitalised universal banks,
such as Germany. It could also pose significant difficulties for the handful
of institutional brokers in the UK which are not owned by banking groups,
and so do not have ready access to capital to back their exposures.
How much subordinated debt should firms be allowed to count as capital for
regulatory purposes? The directive introduces a new type of capital, known
as 'tier three' capital - effectively short-term subordinated debt. Parallel
discussions over a global accord on capital adequacy, between Iosco and the
Basle committee of banking supervisors, proposed earlier this year that tier
three capital should be restricted to 250 per cent of other capital. This
has yet to be accepted by all EC member states.
Should tier three capital be allowed to back all of an investment firm's
risks? There is little dispute that it should cover position risks. But it
is still unclear whether tier three capital will count against large
exposures or the counterparty risks which arise from trading derivative
instruments.
What exactly is a 'trading book'? The definition is important: anything not
on the book will be caught by more stringent capital rules.
The dividing line is a difficult one to enforce. Where, for instance, should
repurchase agreements (or repos) fall? If they are allowed on the trading
book, then the directive could encourage disintermediation of the banking
system. Rather than offering secured loans, financial institutions could
offer reverse repos (arrangements under which they buy securities with an
agreement to sell them back again at a later stage). The effect of the
product would be the same, the capital needed to back it would be less.
However, keeping repos off the trading book could stem the rapidly-growing
repo market in London, which investment banks use to finance themselves.
One suggestion is that repo business done between professionals (broadly,
investment firms and banks) should qualify for the trading book, but this
restrictive definition may not fit the realities of the repo market in all
centres.
Even if final agreement on all these matters can be reached at the meeting
of ministers on June 9, it is debatable whether the final form of the
directive will be agreed. Consultation is due to start this summer on
similar proposals by Iosco and the Basle committee, and it seems unlikely
that EC ministers will want to set in stone rules for European investment
firms which may eventually be out of line with rules agreed globally.
But Portuguese representatives may want to reach a broad political agreement
on the issue before the Portuguese presidency of the EC ends next month. If
they succeed, it could be difficult for other member states to reopen the
issue.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Sunshine breaks through the
clouds over Salomon - Patrick Harverson on relief at the securities house
following its settlement with Federal authorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The clouds that have hovered over Salomon Brothers for the past 10 months
were not completely lifted by Wednesday's Dollars 290m settlement with
Federal authorities.
Some sunshine, however, was allowed to pierce the gloom for the first time
since the giant Wall Street securities house was caught rigging Treasury
bond auctions last year.
Although criminal and civil investigations into individuals and other firms
involved in the scandal continue, and Salomon still faces about 50 private
lawsuits related to the case, top executives at the securities house
breathed a large sigh of relief when the Securities and Exchange Commission,
the Justice Department and the US Attorney's office in New York announced
the settlement of the civil case against Salomon and their decision not to
pursue criminal charges against the firm.
The separate sanctions unveiled the same day by the Federal Reserve - a
60-day ban on all dealings with the New York Fed and no lifting of the ban
on bidding for customers at Treasury auctions until August 3 - also gave
some cause for relief.
While troubling in the short-term, the measures fell well short of the worst
case scenario Salomon had envisaged - the permanent loss of its primary
dealership status - and they are unlikely to have a significant impact on
the firm's bottom line.
Salomon's profitability, however, will be hit by the extra Dollars 185m
pre-tax charge the firm intends to take in the second quarter this year.
The money, along with the Dollars 200m set aside as reserves last year, will
go towards paying the fines, compensation and costs related to the lawsuits
still outstanding against Salomon. The total potential cost of nearly
Dollars 400m would represent more than half of Salomon's profits in a good
year.
There is also the unquantifiable impact on earnings of the business lost
because of the scandal and the long government-led investigation. Salomon
says most clients who withdrew their custom because of the scandal last
August have returned to the fold.
Yet in the highly profitable business of securities underwriting, which
enjoyed an unprecedented boom in 1991 and in the first quarter of this year,
Salomon has lost out badly, either through being downgraded by issuers from
lead managing to co-managing underwritings, or by being left off managing
syndicates altogether.
The underwriting boom was, in the words of Mr Deryck Maughan, Salomon's
chief operating officer, 'a once-in-a-decade opportunity - and we were on
the bench'.
The almost year-long ban on bidding for customers in Treasury auctions must
also have taken its toll, with institutional investors transferring their
business to Salomon's rivals on Wall Street.
Moreover, the shrinking of the capital base and the dramatic overhaul of
internal business lines undertaken by Salomon's new management since the
scandal meant the firm has been in no shape to take full advantage of the
hugely favourable market conditions of the past year.
The scandal has also left a deep scar on Salomon morale. Concern about the
long-term outlook for a company facing federal investigations deeply
unsettled Salomon employees, persuading some in the first few months to jump
ship to rival Wall Street firms.
Even more executives left in the wake of the internal shake up at the firm.
Despite the protestations of the new management, staff in domestic equities
and investment banking regarded the changes at Salomon as an implicit
downgrading of their departments.
The result was a number of damaging defections by key executives and a
further decline in morale. The redesign of the firm's pay system - bonuses
were cut and future compensation tied more closely to performance - also
created unrest and ill-feeling.
Yet for the first time in almost a year, Salomon can envisage a future
without the threat of massive fines or criminal charges hanging over it.
The greatest break for Salomon was the decision of the authorities not to
press criminal charges against the firm. If criminal prosecution had been
sought, Salomon could have been fatally wounded as scores of private and
government clients shied away from a firm facing a drawn-out battle in the
criminal courts.
Much of the credit for avoiding criminal charges must go to Mr Warren
Buffett, the chairman of Salomon. On taking over in August, he pledged the
firm's full co-operation with all investigations - a promise he delivered
on.
Officials at the SEC and the US Attorney's office went out of their way this
week to praise the help they received from Salomon's senior management.
The contrast with the experience government investigators faced in the late
1980s when pursuing wrongdoing at Drexel Burnham Lambert, has escaped no one
on Wall Street. Drexel's refusal to co-operate with the federal authorities
until two years into the investigations eventually cost the firm dear - a
Dollars 650m fine and bankruptcy.
Yet a few critical voices have been raised arguing that Salomon has escaped
lightly, and that the authorities stopped short of criminal prosecution
because the firm was too important to the Treasury markets and the
government's management of its debt.
Having rescued Salomon from disaster - at one point last summer there were
real doubts whether the firm would survive the scandal intact - Mr Buffett
will now withdraw from the scene. He is likely to hand over the reins of
running Salomon Brothers to Mr Maughan soon, and as promised, ensure the
next chairman of the parent group, Salomon Inc, is an outsider with no
previous ties to the firm.
The whole affair, however, is not yet over. Salomon must fight the 50 or
more lawsuits filed by individuals and companies who claim they suffered
losses because of Salomon's actions. The firm now has almost Dollars 100m
set aside to cover the cost of these cases and most observers believe the
reserve should be sufficient.
The authorities, meanwhile, are still pursuing their investigations into the
individuals involved in the scandal, notably Mr Paul Mozer, the bond trader
accused of faking customer bids in Treasury auctions and who is likely to
face criminal charges unless he can strike a deal with the government.
The senior managers at Salomon, including the former chairman Mr John
Gutfreund, who waited four months before reporting their knowledge of Mr
Mozer's activities are being investigated for possible civil violations, and
will probably be fined heavily for failure to supervise the firm properly.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Japan's trading companies post
fall in earnings, sales
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
JAPAN'S big six trading companies yesterday reported an expected fall in
both sales and earnings for the fiscal year that ended March 31 due to the
global economic slowdown and sour financial investments.
Weaker domestic demand curbed import revenues, while there was also a
decline in income from third-country transactions. In terms of product
sectors, there was a decline in turnover from energy and chemical products
as crude oil prices fell. A price drop for metals also depressed income. But
sales of machinery rose for some companies.
Most of the trading houses expect pre-tax earnings will remain flat or rise
only slightly during the current fiscal year reflecting the gradual recovery
of the global economy.
C. Itoh &amp; Co retained its position as the world's biggest trading company
with Y20,000bn (Dollars 154.26bn) in sales, but it suffered its first profit
fall in five years with pre-tax earnings declining by 16.7 per cent to
Y45.28bn. After-tax profits plunged by 42.7 per cent to Y10.9bn as
extraordinary losses amounted to Y5.9bn. C. Itoh predicts sales will fall
slightly to Y19,000bn in the current fiscal year, while pre-tax profit will
be steady at Y45bn. The after-tax profit is expected to rise to Y12bn.
Sumitomo Corp reported an 18.1 per cent fall in pre-tax earnings to Y63.25bn
as its net financial income was cut by 48 per cent to Y13bn. This reflected
a decline in net interest and dividend income and losses on securities.
Sumitomo predicts pre-tax earnings will increase slightly to Y66bn as sales
reach Y19,000bn. After-tax profits are expected to reach Y34bn.
Marubeni had the sharpest pre-tax earnings setback among the top trading
companies with a 29.9 per cent drop to Y38.4bn. Its deficit on net financial
items nearly doubled to Y20.6bn due to a fall in interest and dividend
income. But its after-tax profit increased by 2.2 per cent to Y17.4bn as
extraordinary losses eased. It expects pre-tax and after-tax earnings to
remain steady this fiscal year, while sales should decline slightly to
Y17,000bn.
Mitsui and Co performed better than than its competitors with a 7.1 per cent
fall in pre-tax earnings to Y61.4bn. It narrowed its deficit in financial
income to Y5.9bn from Y19.8bn in the previous fiscal year.
Its after-tax profit grew by 1.7 per cent to Y22.6bn as it reduced its
extraordinary losses, mostly connected with the ill-fated Iranian joint
venture petrochemical project, to Y10.2bn from Y29bn a year ago.
It expects moderate rises in its pre-tax and after-tax earnings to Y62bn and
Y23bn respectively in the current fiscal year, while sales should increase
by 2 per cent to Y16,500bn.
Mitsubishi Corp had the highest pre-tax profit at Y85.89bn among the main
trading companies, although it represented a decline of 8.9 per cent. It was
the only trading house to predict a significant earnings drop this fiscal
year, despite a slight rise in sales to Y16bn. It estimated pre-tax earnings
will fall by 20 per cent to Y70bn and after-tax profits by 25 per cent to
Y30bn. But analysts cautioned that Mitsubishi is normally conservative in
its forecasts.
Nissho Iwai had the sharpest fall in sales with an 18.2 per cent decline to
Y10,900bn. It predicts a 5.4 per cent decrease in pre-tax profits to Y20bn.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Losses at EniChem up to L742bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   MILAN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LOSSES at EniChem, the troubled Italian state-owned chemicals group, leaped
in 1991, to L742bn (Dollars 615m) after minority interests, compared with
L86bn in the previous 12 months.
Before minorities, losses rose more than 10 times to L722bn from L68bn in
1990, while at parent company level losses amounted to L732bn. A dividend,
cut to L15 a share last year, will not be paid. Group sales fell by 6 per
cent to L13,424bn.
The result, which was worse than expected, confirms the immense difficulties
facing the group, which re-entered the public sector after the collapse of
the Enimont joint venture and sale of its stake by Montedison in November
1990.
EniChem, Italy's biggest chemicals company, has failed to get to grips with
the severe problems facing the world chemicals industry. Long-awaited
disposals and strategic alliances to move away from base chemicals have been
put off, and large-scale redundancies and plant closures have been pushed
aside by political considerations. Meanwhile, wrangles within EniChem and
with its parent, the Eni energy and chemicals holding company, have
complicated matters.
EniChem blamed its results on the sharp fall in product prices due to weak
demand and over-capacity in many sectors of the industry. The effect of
declining prices, not matched by a drop in raw materials costs, was
reflected in the collapse of operating profits, to L77bn from L743bn in
1990.
The group's problems have been severely exacerbated by the extreme weakness
of its balance sheet, which has left it under-capitalised and facing a heavy
debt burden. This has only been partly mitigated by the transfer of some
activities, notably refineries and the heavily loss-making fertilisers
operation, to other parts of the Eni group.
Although net debt fell by L1,337bn to L7,004bn at the end of last year, the
figures mask contrasting tendencies. While just over L2,850bn of debt was
shifted off the balance sheet though the transfer of activities to Eni,
borrowing increased by over L1,500bn to help finance cash-flow and maintain
investments.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: O&amp;Y offers safeguards to fend
off creditors
</HEADLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York has offered its creditors financial safeguards aimed at
thwarting their efforts to unravel the court order which has frozen the
troubled developer's Canadian debt obligations.
An O&amp;Y lawyer urged an Ontario court yesterday not to make any exemptions
from the order granted last week under Canada's Companies Creditors
Arrangements Act. If the restructuring of O&amp;Y's USDollars 12bn debt is to
have any chance of success, he said, creditors must be kept at bay and no
creditor should be given an advantage.
In return, O&amp;Y has proposed to identify all revenues and expenses according
to the asset to which they relate, and to set up separate bank accounts for
each asset.
Administrative and restructuring costs of the parent company, Olympia &amp; York
Developments, would be allocated on a proportionate basis among the various
assets. O&amp;Y made its offer in response to a slew of motions submitted by
disgruntled creditors, represented by about 40 lawyers. These will be
considered at hearings next Thursday and Friday.
The lenders' main concern is to prevent any 'co-mingling' of funds between
O&amp;Y's Canadian operations, and its businesses in the US and Britain, which
are not subject to court protection.
A motion by Bank of Nova Scotia could stall the proposed sale later this
month of O&amp;Y's 18 per cent interest in Santa Fe Pacific, the Chicago-based
railway and mining company. In addition, holders of securities backed by
individual buildings are seeking exemption from the CCAA order to enable
them to seize rents in lieu of overdue interest.
Mr Bernard Wilson, the Price Waterhouse partner appointed as a liaison
between O&amp;Y and its lenders, assured creditors in an affidavit that he
expected to be able to review revenues and expenses on each property, 'and
the application of any excess'.
The court ordered Mr Wilson to provide cash-flow projections on specific O&amp;Y
assets by next Monday. He is due to present his first full report to the
lenders on June 15, and at monthly intervals after that.
Although lawyers for the banks responded cautiously to O&amp;Y's proposals,
several described them as a step in the right direction.
Meanwhile, O&amp;Y and some of its bank lenders have joined forces to prevent
disgruntled commercial paper-holders from forming a committee to press their
claims. The paper is secured by Exchange Tower, a 36-storey building in
Toronto. O&amp;Y has failed to conclude a sale-and-leaseback deal on the
building which would have allowed it to redeem about CDollars 150m in
outstanding commercial paper.
It emerged at a five-hour meeting in Toronto that the company and several of
its bank lenders hold substantial quantities of the commercial paper
themselves. Other holders, including Merrill Lynch, the securities firm,
were unable to muster the two-thirds majority necessary to form the
committee.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Weak demand keeps Navistar in
red
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MARTIN DICKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NAVISTAR, the leading US manufacturer of medium and heavy trucks, yesterday
reported a second-quarter net loss of Dollars 35m. It predicted that weak
demand would keep it in the red for the third quarter.
The loss, which worked through at 17 cents a share, compared with a loss of
Dollars 29m, or 15 cents a share, in the same period of 1991. Sales and
revenues totalled Dollars 914m, down from Dollars 940m, while shipments
dipped 17 per cent, from 21,200 units to 17,500.
The company blamed the shipments drop on lower demand for school bus
chassis. Navistar, which has a particularly large share of the school bus
market, said some fleets had been deferring purchases.
'While there has been a clear, but selective, improvement in heavy truck
demand,' said James Cotting, Navistar's chairman, 'we have not as yet seen
the same signs of recovery in the market for medium trucks and school
buses.'
Navistar said it had maintained its position as sales leader in the North
American retail market for medium and heavy trucks, with a 26.3 per cent
market share in the first half. This, however, was down from 29.3 per cent
for the same period of 1991.
The company's backlog of orders for heavy trucks rose 41 per cent from
levels of a year ago, but medium truck and bus orders declined 14 per cent.
For the first six months, the company reported a net loss of Dollars 67m, or
32 cents a share, compared with a net loss of Dollars 67m, or 33 cents, in
the same period last year.

<TEXT>
MORGAN Stanley, the New York investment bank, yesterday continued Wall
Street's spate of strong earnings when it reported first-quarter net income
of Dollars 139.1m.
The profits were ahead of the Dollars 120.1m reported in the first quarter
of last year, but the figures were not directly comparable because the
company has changed the end of its first quarter to April from March in
previous years.
Morgan Stanley, which this week lead-managed the sale of General Motors'
Dollars 2.1bn share offering, the largest ever by a US company, has been
benefiting from a rising stock market and a boom in new issues of equity.
However, its shares dropped in trading yesterday, to stand at Dollars 51 3/4
, down Dollars 1 5/8 , at the close.
Mr Richard Fisher, chairman, said investment banking revenues were supported
by an active equity underwriting calendar and increased financial advisory
revenues.
Global sales and trading activity remained strong, although somewhat below
the record levels seen in the first quarter of last year.
The figures were helped by the realisation of investment revenues from its
stake in Coltec Industries, a company which was floated on the stock market
during the period.
Earnings per share for the quarter totalled Dollars 1.62, against Dollars
1.54 in the first quarter of last year, while revenues were Dollars 808m,
against Dollars 748m.
Investment banking revenues were Dollars 270m, up from Dollars 187m. Morgan
Stanley's trading revenues on its own account dropped from Dollars 393m to
Dollars 291m, while investment revenue rose from Dollars 5m to Dollars
31.2m.

SMITH BARNEY, the New York broking house, said yesterday it had held
discussions with General Electric, the parent of securities firm Kidder
Peabody, about buying all or part of Kidder in what would amount to a
significant consolidation of Wall Street strength.
However, Mr Frank Zarb, chief executive of Smith Barney, told staff that the
firm was not now pursuing the discussions.
He was responding to a report in The Wall Street Journal that GE, which
bought Kidder in 1986, had decided to sell the company and that Primerica,
the financial services group which owns Smith Barney, was the front-runner
to buy it. GE refused to comment on 'rumours' but insisted it was 'extremely
pleased' with Kidder's performance.
Suggestions that GE might dispose of Kidder have circulated for years, but
yesterday's Smith Barney comments provide the firmest evidence yet that it
might be prepared to do so.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Fiat layoffs meet hostile
reaction
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The prospect of over 5,000 layoffs following Fiat's purchase of a 90 per
cent stake met a hostile reaction among the 23,000 workers currently
employed in FSM's two plants at Bialsko Biala in southern Poland. A
spokesman for the Solidarity trade union said three unions had called a
strike alert, which is often the first stage leading to strike action,
writes Anthony Robinson.
Although weakened by the recession which has seen industrial production in
state-owned enterprises slump 40 per cent over the last two years, the trade
unions and the workers councils still retain allegiance among workers
fearful of layoffs and affected by the government's 'popiwek' tax designed
to keep wage increases below the rate of inflation.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: Fiat boosts expansion programme
 -Haig Simonian on the Italian car maker's investment in Poland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
By agreeing to take 90 per cent of a new company to be formed with Poland's
FSM cars group, Fiat, Italy's biggest private sector company, has moved a
decisive step forward in its international expansion. However, the accord
also involved a substantial increase in the size of its planned investment.
In the memorandum of understanding signed by Italian and Polish negotiators
last October, Fiat committed itself to taking just 51 per cent of FSM. That
would have given the Turin-based company management control over the Polish
group in which it had invested Dollars 800m in a project to create and build
in Poland its new Cinquecento mini-car.
The new car, introduced to the Italian market in March, has had considerable
success. Early orders have already exceeded 40,000, while the 20,000
deliveries so far played a role in helping Fiat appreciably to improve its
share of the domestic car market last month. Production of the Cinquecento
is to be increased to 240,000 a year.
But the deal signed in Warsaw on Wednesday night involves a much bigger
commitment by Fiat than originally planned. Its stake in FSM has risen to 90
per cent, while the overall size of its Polish investment will reach around
Dollars 2bn over the coming years.
Fiat is in the early phases of a huge L47,000bn (Dollars 39bn) 10-year
investment plan to revise its entire model range and build a big assembly
plant and engine facilities in southern Italy. But last week, the group
announced a 30 per cent drop in net profits for 1991, while its net
financial position slipped into the red for the first time since 1986. With
its finances stretched, what persuaded Fiat to step up its Polish
commitment?
The group's Polish activities stretch back to 1921, when it set up a
subsidiary there. In 1971, FSM started producing Fiat 126 cars under
licence, followed five years later by the Polonez, based on Fiat's 125
model. Talks on taking a direct stake began soon after Poland's democratic
reform. Wednesday's agreement marks the biggest step so far in Poland's
privatisation programme.
The new arrangement will allow Fiat to integrate the Polish company, which
employs about 23,000, much more closely into its group operations. After
selling SEAT in Spain to Volkswagen in the mid-80s, Fiat has been exposed
among Europe's leading car producers in not having any significant
production capacity outside its home market. With the example of VW's
purchase of Skoda in Czechoslovakia still familiar, the Italians may have
sought a similar arrangement for themselves.
Meanwhile, costs in Italy have been rising fast. In his letter to
shareholders earlier this year, Fiat's chairman, Mr Giovanni (Gianni)
Agnelli warned of the competitive disadvantages increasingly facing Italian
manufacturers. At over 6 per cent, Italian inflation remains stubbornly
above France and Germany.
The labour market is inflexible, while industry suffers also from less
obvious hindrances like poor public services.
Despite the disincentives, the company is investing heavily in southern
Italy - helped by some sizeable government investment grants. However, it
may have felt the time had come to lay down a bigger marker elsewhere.
The Polish investment may also reflect difficulties in Fiat's other big east
European project - the planned purchase of a stake in VAZ, Russia's biggest
car maker. The VAZ deal, which is still under negotiation, was itself a
substitute for a much more ambitious venture to build an entirely new car
plant at a greenfield site at Yelabuga.
After Yelabuga was put on hold, largely as a result of the increasing
financial problems facing the then Soviet Union, the VAZ proposal was put
forward instead. Now, even that has melted into the background, although
company officials say it has not been laid to rest.
Fiat's strong interest in east European markets was highlighted last month
when Mr Renato Ruggiero, Italy's former foreign trade minister who sits on
the company's board and has responsibility for its international affairs,
visited Kazakhstan. He met local leaders for exploratory talks on the
possibility of setting up a new car plant.
Developments in Fiat's model strategy may also have influenced its new
Polish strategy. Rather than just build the Cinquecento, the deal with FSM
involves the creation of a second model programme, designed to replace the
126 mini-car. Like the Cinquecento, the new model will be devised with both
western and eastern European customers in mind. Arrangements for producing
the new model are likely to be similar to those for the Cinquecento.
To keep costs down and provide an adequate margin on such low-priced models,
production for eastern European markets will be concentrated in Poland.
Much will rely on the marketing. Like the Cinquecento, the model is likely
to be pushed as a 'city car' in countries like Italy, where the compact size
and convenience of the model are being stressed. Meanwhile, in
economically-stretched eastern Europe, utilitarian qualities and relative
cheapness are likely to be the main selling points.

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ALAN WATKINS, the former chief executive of Hawker Siddeley who resigned
after BTR won control of the company in November, has become a non-executive
director at Dobson Park Industries.
The announcement came yesterday as the industrial electronics and mining
equipment group announced a slight fall of 4.6 per cent in pre-tax profits
for the six months ended March 28 from Pounds 6.5m to Pounds 6.2m, and a
maintained interim dividend of 1.9p. Earnings slipped from 3.52p to 3.32p.
Mr Alan Kaye, chairman and chief executive, will relinquish the role of
chief executive from May 25, continuing as full-time chairman. This ends a
temporary combination of the two jobs following the retirement of the former
chairman, Mr Gordon Marshall, in October.
Mr Kaye, who has been chief executive for nearly eight years, will be
replaced by Mr Oliver Chapple, the current deputy chief executive, who
joined the company from T&amp;N last September.
Mr Watkins' appointment is his first of any significance since he left
Hawker, but it was expected he would receive several offers from British
industry where his knowledge of manufacturing and product strategy could be
put to use.
Dobson Park has been diversifying away from its traditional mining equipment
business in the past five years into industrial electronics, serving
industries such as aerospace. Mr Kaye said Mr Watkins' experience at Hawker,
and previously as managing director of Lucas Aerospace, would help the
company with its future strategy and acquisitions.
He described the latest profits at Dobson Park, struck on turnover of Pounds
98.8m (Pounds 114.2m), as 'satisfactory' in the context of a difficult
market situation.
Industrial electronics increased profitability compared with the second half
of 1991, due mainly to cost savings and new products, but profits of Pounds
2.57m were still lower than the Pounds 3.4m recorded a year earlier.
Mining equipment profits rose from Pounds 2.07m to Pounds 3.03m, in spite of
continuing contraction in demand from British Coal. This was more than
offset by substantial overseas contracts, a good performance from the
US-based conveyor company and the effects of rationalisation in the UK.
In December the group announced a radical restructuring of the division
because of forthcoming changes in the UK coal mining industry, and is
withdrawing from its high-volume product areas.
Mr Kaye said there had been some recent signs of recovery in certain
markets, particularly the US.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Drayton Cons writes Pounds 47m off assets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN, Investments Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DRAYTON Consolidated Trust, the investment trust company specialising in
unquoted assets, said yesterday that it had written off more than half the
value of its unlisted assets to Pounds 40.1m at the end of March from Pounds
87m just six months earlier.
The company, which is managed by Invesco MIM, also said that its advisers,
County NatWest Wood Mackenzie and Cazenove, had recommended proposals for
the remaining assets which would allow shareholders to receive cash as
assets were sold.
The advisers were appointed in February following the announcement that
receivers had been appointed to Alma Holdings, the unquoted confectionery
company in which Drayton was the main shareholder.
In its statement yesterday, Drayton said the sharp drop in valuation of the
unquoted portfolio over the past six months largely reflected the write-off
in Alma Holdings as well as write-offs against the value of property
occupied by City Merchants Bank and by further provisions against other
unspecified investments.
Drayton said its advisers were suggesting the formation of a new quoted
investment company which would hold the unquoted investments until they
could be sold in an orderly manner. The new company would also own several
quoted, but illiquid, investments. Meanwhile, as the remaining assets are
sold, shareholders will receive cash.
At end-March the trust's current assets were valued at Pounds 86.3m, down
from Pounds 162m at the end of September 1991. Gross income for the half
year to March 31 fell to Pounds 3.98m (Pounds 5.05m). The interim dividend
is maintained at 4.25p.

Jackson Group, the Ipswich-based engineering and construction concern, fell
Pounds 1.55m into the red in 1991 compared with pre-tax profits of Pounds
827,000 previously. Turnover was little changed at Pounds 59.3m.
Some Pounds 1m (Pounds 550,000) of the loss was as a result of the reduction
in value of dealing property stock. After a tax credit of Pounds 498,000
(Pounds 134,000 charge) the loss per share amounted to 4.9p (3.2p earnings).
However, the directors are recommending a final dividend of 1p (2.2p) for a
2p (3.2p) total.

York Waterworks announced pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.09m for the year to
March 31 compared with Pounds 2.11m for the previous 15 months.
Turnover amounted to Pounds 6.88m (Pounds 7.59m) and the pre-tax result was
after net interest payable of Pounds 433,000 (Pounds 642,000).
A final dividend of 5.7p is recommended for an 8.5p total (8.75p for 15
months) payable from earnings per share of 20.7p (19.8p).
The company agreed to the director general's request late last year to
voluntarily reduce the K factor it would apply to its charges in 1992-93.
Accordingly the increase for the year is 15 per cent less than the maximum
permitted.

Merchant Retail Group, the food retailer, returned profits of Pounds 1.72m
pre-tax for the 12 months ended March 28, a 49 per cent downturn on the
previous year's Pounds 3.37m.
Earnings fell from 3.06p to 1.24p and the final dividend is being omitted,
leaving shareholders with 1.1p for the year (2.29p). The shares dipped 2p
yesterday to 16p.
Directors blamed most of the profits setback on Normans Superwarehouses,
where net margins fell from 3.9 per cent to 2.5 per cent and trading profits
from Pounds 4.35m to Pounds 2.8m.
They said the 'significant sales increase' anticipated at Normans in the
Christmas period failed to materialise - Normans trades from 19 stores in
the south-west of England.
Group sales improved from Pounds 149.97m to Pounds 155.04m.

PROFITS before tax of Airflow Streamlines, the Northampton-based cab
manufacturer and Ford main dealer, fell from Pounds 1.22m to Pounds 87,000
over the 12 months ended February 29.
Earnings per share dived to 0.07p (8.97p) and the dividend for the year is a
nominal 0.1p - shareholders received a 4p total the previous year.
The directors said reduced demand had affected both the cab-making
operations of the production division and Whiteleys during the opening half
year.
They added, however, that the delayed introduction of a new model range in
August had improved the trading position in the second half but not enough
to recover the loss in the first half.
The Ford main dealership continued to experience reduced sales and margins
for new vehicles, but used car sales and margins were improved.
Looking ahead, the directors said that 'after two years of reduced demand .
. . the prospect of improved trading conditions appears to be emerging'.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Banking on breaking down the barriers to
China - Foreign trade and investment in China are growing rapidly and
Hongkong Bank is well placed to benefit when the colony reverts to Chinese
control in 1997 / The Battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OUTSIDE HONGKONG Bank's Shenzhen branch on a sultry weekday afternoon in the
south China town, two dozen customers stand in line to use the cash machine.
If they want, they will be able to draw cash from accounts on the other side
of the world.
The cash machine is one of many bridgeheads by Hongkong Bank into China. So
far the Shenzhen cash machine is its only one in China and it can be used
only by non-Chinese nationals who draw their cash not in the RMB of the
People's Republic of China, but in Hongkong dollars.
Hongkong Bank however hopes that the day is not too far off when the RMB
will become a convertible currency and it will be able to offer a fuller
range of banking services to China's 1.2bn citizens.
Judged by the vast scale of the country, Hongkong Bank's three branches and
six representative offices in China are little more than a toehold: but the
Chinese operations are mostly concentrated in the south, where foreign banks
and international investors are co-operating with Chinese authorities to
produce an explosion of economic development. Only Standard Chartered has a
comparable presence among foreign banks.
Foreign trade and investment in China are growing rapidly, as manufacturing
shifts from Hong Kong to Shenzhen and other towns in the Pearl River Delta
in special economic zones in Guangdong province just across the border.
The results are extraordinary. Between 1980 and 1991 Shenzhen transformed
from a fishing town of 50,000 people to a frenetic industrial metropolis and
financial centre with a population of 2m. In 1990 it opened its own stock
exchange.
'The differences between Hong Kong and its neighbouring towns are getting
rapidly less distinct,' says Miss Rose Lee, assistant general manager at
Hongkong Bank.
Not that Shenzhen is entirely what it looks. Most of its workforce comes
from Chinese villages on one-year contracts. Workers may earn less than
Dollars 100 a month. Their American and Hong Kong Chinese managers return
home each night to the British territory.
Like other Hong Kong business institutions, Hongkong Bank hopes that by
1997, when the territory reverts to Chinese sovereignty, an economic miracle
of unprecedented proportions will mean that actual changes in the business
environment are relatively minor.
The changes are a reward for several decades after 1949 when Hongkong Bank
maintained a token presence in China believing that some day economic
relations would revive. During the lean years its role as the de facto
central banker of Hong Kong helped it in its dealings with the Chinese
authorities. But at the end of the 1970s it had only the Shanghai branch in
China.
Business with China breaks down into several categories: trade finance,
project finance for infrastructural developments such as the proposed
motorway to link Hong Kong and Shenzhen; direct lending to joint ventures
and state corporations; and bank guarantees for Chinese businesses.
The bank provides no figures about the size of its business in China but,
though most of China's USDollars 135.7bn foreign trade in 1991 seems to have
been handled by Chinese banks, there is clearly plenty of business around.
Unofficial estimates place the size of the the Hongkong Bank loan book in
China at more than USDollars 4bn, well ahead of its nearest rival, Standard
Chartered.
Working relations with the Chinese authorities, especially the government of
Guangdong Province, are clearly good and getting closer all the time. Just
how intimate they are is difficult for third parties to assess.
In Beijing relations are more delicate: Hongkong Bank is one of many
supplicants, though it can project itself as an important source of
information and good publicity about China to the rest of the world.
Hongkong Bank officials are upbeat when discussing China's future and
business prospects, but there is a slight note of whistling in the dark
about predictions of China's political future.
The underlying argument is that if there is a vast and thriving trading and
industrial empire in free trade zones such as Shenzhen, the Pearl Delta, and
perhaps by 1997 Shanghai as well, then the precise complexion of the Beijing
government will not matter too much.
There is special reticence on both sides about the precise reaction of the
Beijing authorities to the bid for Midland and proposals to shift Hongkong
Bank's headquarters to London. Peoples Bank officials, who are voluble about
discussing plans to quintuple the size of the Shenzhen economic zone, fall
silent when asked about the merger, and say they can add nothing to the
Beijing Foreign Ministry statement.
The acid test seems to be Hongkong Bank's future attachment to Hong Kong.
Miss Lee said: 'They have told us that they understand about international
acquisitions but we don't want you to do anything that is not in the
interests of Hong Kong. That suits us because our intention is to increase
our business here even further if we possibly can, on top of our very high
market share.'

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Political lobbying over Midland takeover
gathers steam - MPs with a specialist or constituency interest are lining up
behind Hongkong / The battle for Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH competing attractions like Maastricht, Olympia &amp; York and the Maxwell
pensioners, the battle for Midland is not at the top of most MPs' agendas.
Nevertheless, the lobbying offensive mounted by the protagonists is
beginning to bear fruit. MPs with constituency interests are starting to
think through the possible local consequences of what is proposed.
Meanwhile, those whose special interests include financial services are
considering the ways in which this case will affect competition, employment
and merger regulation.
Among the first group are a large number of MPs fearful that a Lloyds Bank
takeover of Midland could produce significant job losses in their
constituencies. Some of these have signed an early day motion supporting
Hongkong &amp; Shanghai Banking Corporation's plans which was tabled at
Westminster by Mr Jacques Arnold, the Conservative MP for Gravesham and a
former Midland employee. In all, 61 Tory, Labour and Plaid Cymru MPs have
backed the motion.
Of these, it is Labour MPs in Sheffield like Mr Richard Caborn and Mr Clive
Betts who articulate perhaps the most pressing local interest. Midland is
now the biggest private-sector employer in the erstwhile steel capital of
the world. Some 1,750 of the bank's 2,500 local staff are employed in the
type of head office functions that are perceived to be vulnerable in the
event of a Lloyds takeover.
Mr Caborn says luring Midland 'gave a confidence to the city that has
enabled it to attract other financial institutions'. According to Mr Betts,
'the worrying thing is that there has been no discussion about the
implications in Sheffield'.
Lloyds, which admits that 20,000 jobs might be lost - the vast majority, it
claims, on a voluntary basis - if it took over Midland, retorts that it
would take the best from both banks. Midland employees in Sheffield would be
retained if their performance warranted it.
The bank further contends that retrenchment is inevitable and ongoing in
'overbanked' Britain. It would be better for this process to unfold on a
planned rather than a haphazard basis, as it argued at a recent meeting with
a small group of senior Tory backbenchers.
Hongkong Bank - which has arguably adopted the more aggressive tactics in
these early lobbying exchanges - is now attempting to build on these
expressions of support by circulating material detailing where a
Lloyds-Midland merger would damage competition by causing branch closures.
Its advisers have unearthed 28 constituencies - including those represented
by Mr Michael Heseltine, President of the Board of Trade, Mr Neil Kinnock,
the Labour party leader, and Mr Douglas Hogg, junior foreign office minister
 -which they say contain towns faced with a 'prospective monopoly' of bank
branches since they currently boast only one Midland and one Lloyds outlet.
Lloyds and Midland between them own more than 50 per cent of bank branches
in nine postal areas or counties, including Gloucestershire, Warwickshire
and West Glamorgan, the material claims.
Lloyds discounts the research on the grounds it is inaccurate, makes no
reference to other financial outlets such as building societies, and does
not indicate whether Midland proposes closing any of the branches mentioned
anyway under its own plans.
Midland is also attempting to rally Westminster support to the Hongkong
banner by encouraging its employees to write 'from your home address' to
their local MPs urging them to sign Mr Arnold's early day motion.
'Using your own words, expressing deep concern as a Midland employee on what
the Lloyds approach would mean for jobs and customer choice, you should ask
your MP . . . to sign Early Day Motion No. 39,' a letter signed by Mr Brian
Pearse, chief executive, and addressed 'Dear Colleague', advises. 'If your
customers offer to assist, you can suggest they might like to take the same
course of action.'
However, some MPs who support Hongkong see shortcomings in making a stark
distinction between the two sides' proposals in terms of future employment
prospects.
'The employment argument is a weak one,' says Mr Tim Devlin, the
Conservative MP for Stockton South and a signatory to the Arnold motion. He
says Britain has 'far too many' bank branches and staff. 'The argument has
got to be on competition; if Lloyds and Midland go in together that will
reduce the number of mainstream banks.'
Mr Peter Viggers, the Tory MP for Gosport, has singled out the regulatory
aspects of the present position as a cause for concern, calling for both
sets of proposals to be examined 'under the same jurisdiction'.
Although his stance on this mirrors that of Lloyds, Mr Viggers says he is
not taking sides 'at this point'. He says a number of colleagues 'feel
dissatisfaction' that the Hongkong bid is being examined by the European
Commission.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: US partner in prospect for Syncordia
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BT may take a US partner into Syncordia, its global communications venture,
Mr Iain Vallance said yesterday. Syncordia, formed last year with the aim of
providing communications services to multinational corporations, had a
difficult birth. BT's original plan to sell a stake to Deutsche Telekom was
abandoned when the German state-owned telephone company formed an alliance
with France Telecom, its French counterpart.
The idea that Syncordia may take a US partner runs counter to BT's original
intentions. Mr Vallance previously argued that Syncordia, based in Atlanta,
Georgia, could serve the US market on its own.
Mr Vallance refused to say which US companies BT was talking to except that
IBM, the computer giant and now a Syncordia customer, was not one of them.
In the past, MCI, the long-distance telecommunications group, has expressed
an interest in joining.
Mr Vallance said that, as the European telecommunications services market
was being progressively opened up to competition, BT did not need German or
French participation in Syncordia. He said he was still hoping to involve
Japan's Nippon Telegraph and Telephone in the venture.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: BT to increase pay-out by 8.3% despite dip
in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BT, Britain's dominant telecommunications group, yesterday announced an 8.3
per cent increase in dividends despite suffering its first drop in profits
since privatisation eight years ago.
The company also announced that it planned to reduce staff numbers by up to
24,000, or 12 per cent of its workforce, in the current financial year as
part of a drive to improve efficiency.
Staff numbers were cut by 16,400 last financial year and by 18,900 in the
year before that, giving an expected reduction of 60,000 over three years.
Pre-tax profits for the year to end-March were Pounds 3.073bn, a marginal
decline on the Pounds 3.075bn in the previous financial year. A combination
of the recession, growing competition from Mercury Communications and
tighter regulation by Oftel, the industry regulator, brought to an end a
period of strong and unbroken profits growth.
Turnover increased by 1.4 per cent to Pounds 13.3bn. Mr Iain Vallance,
chairman, said that 'firm management control of operating costs' had
prevented the fall in profits being greater.
Mr Michael Hepher, group managing director, said that early responses to the
company's new redundancy scheme indicated there would be sufficient
volunteers. He also reiterated that the current job cuts were not 'the end
of the road'.
The company expects the cost of this year's redundancies to be Pounds 400m,
of which about Pounds 120m will come from an existing provision for
restructuring the organisation. The rest will be charged to the profit and
loss account.
There will also be an increase of about Pounds 550m in BT's pension
liability, although it will not be clear whether this will lead to an end in
the company's three-year pension holiday until a revaluation of pension
funds is completed in the autumn.
BT said its share of the basic telecommunications services market was about
93 per cent and its share of the international calls had fallen to less than
80 per cent. Inland call volumes grew by only 1 per cent while international
volumes increased by 4 per cent.
Capital expenditure fell to Pounds 2.45bn from Pounds 2.76bn. Cash flow,
after capital expenditure and dividends, doubled to Pounds 1.04bn from
Pounds 521m.
Earnings per share fell 2.2 per cent to 33.2p. The full year dividend is
being increased 8.3 per cent to 14.4p.

FT  22 MAY 92 / SEC suggests share change rule

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOREIGN investment companies could find it considerably easier to sell their
shares in the US under a rule change being considered by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, the US securities industry watchdog.
In a report yesterday, the SEC's investment management division proposed
that some foreign funds should be allowed to offer their shares in the US
without having to register with the SEC. In theory, this could cover the
likes of British investment trust shares or unit trusts.
However, the staff report suggested that these foreign funds would need to
demonstrate that regulation in their home country provided a level of
investor protection which was 'substantially equivalent' to that provided by
the SEC. It also called for attempts to establish 'reciprocity', so that US
funds would have access to foreign markets.
The recommendation comes as part of a review of the 1940 Investment Company
Act, which covers investment management regulation in the US. The SEC has
been considering revisions to the rules for the past two years.
The report also recommends deregulating sales charges for mutual funds in
the US; allowing funds to redeem shares at specific intervals; and exempting
from SEC registration funds that are limited to sophisticated investors.
In the past, foreign funds have found it difficult to offer shares in the
US, without effectively becoming US investment companies. No foreign
investment company has registered in the US since 1973.
Some of recommendations - including the sale of non-US mutual funds in the
US - would require legislative changes. One US lawyer said yesterday that an
earlier proposal to allow non-US mutual funds to sell products in the US
failed to get through the legislature in 1984.
The proposed changes were broadly welcomed by the Investment Company
Institute. However, on the issue of 'increased internationalisation', it
warned that the proposed legislative changes 'might not provide sufficient
protection for US investors investing in foreign funds or effective market
access for US funds seeking to offer their shares abroad'.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Thai protesters vow to keep up fight

<TEXT>
PRO-DEMOCRACY demonstra-tors released yesterday from Bangkok jails vowed to
pursue their campaign for the resignation of Gen Suchinda Kraprayoon,
Thailand's unelected prime minister.
After the king ended three days of violence by arranging a compromise on
Wednesday night between the government and the opposition, small groups
marched peacefully behind a black flag to the Democracy Monument in the city
centre yesterday evening to mourn over 40 people killed by soldiers since
Sunday night.
The mood in the capital was one of anger and disappointment that Gen
Suchinda, the former armed forces chief who became prime minister last
month, had not yet been forced to quit.
The government lifted a night-time curfew announced on Wednesday and
withdrew orders to three anti-government newspapers to suspend publication,
but a state of emergency which includes a ban on gatherings of more than 10
people remained in force. Protesters have largely ignored the ban.
Other countries welcomed the intervention of King Bhumipol Adulyadej, the
halt to the violence and the release of 3,000 protesters. The Foreign Office
in London told British tourists that it was now safe to travel to Thailand.
The Bangkok stock market responded euphorically to the deal arranged by the
king. The SET index rose 9 per cent, or 60.30, to 738.67, more than
recouping its losses earlier in the week.
While factories and shops reopened, some business leaders said they saw
little chance of an end to the crisis or the revival of investor confidence
until Gen Suchinda resigned. One executive of the Federation of Thai
Industries called for a general election to introduce a fresh set of
politicians into parliament.
Critics of the government interpreted conflicting statements from members of
the five-party coalition as evidence of renewed stalling over constitutional
reforms which are seen as a way out of the crisis.
Speaking at an emergency meeting of the cabinet yesterday, Gen Suchinda
repeated the promise he made in a midnight broadcast on Wednesday to support
a speedy amendment of the constitution. The opposition is now focusing its
demands on a provision that would require the prime minister to be an
elected MP.
Since Gen Suchinda has not been elected and has repeatedly said he does not
want to be involved in what he calls sordid electoral politics, this could
mean his resignation.
Some members of the coalition said they would support the proposal for an
elected premier and would not require a long transitional period that would
allow Gen Suchinda to continue in office.
One government MP was even reported as saying he should resign when
parliament convenes.

FT  22 MAY 92 / SFO increases threshold for fraud investigations to Pounds
5m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office will in future investigate only alleged frauds
involving Pounds 5m or more, Mr George Staple, the SFO's new director,
announced yesterday.
It will also probably take on new cases only where it expects to use its
unique Section 2 powers to compel interviewees to give evidence, he said.
The SFO's decision to tighten its criteria for accepting new cases,
including raising the threshold from Pounds 2m, was prompted by an
unprecedented rise in the value of alleged frauds, Mr Staple said.
It is expected to maintain its case load at about 60 cases a year.
A former partner at City law firm Clifford Chance, Mr Staple last month took
over at the SFO from Mrs Barbara Mills, the new director of public
prosecutions.
Speaking after publication of the SFO's annual report yesterday, Mr Staple
said the value of alleged frauds rose from Pounds 1.6bn in 1990-91 to Pounds
5.3bn in 1991-92. The inquiries into the Bank of Credit and Commerce
International and Maxwell dealings were largely responsible for the
increase.
'While the caseload of the SFO has remained at around 55 to 60, size and
complexity has increased. This reflects the increasingly high value of cases
taken on by the SFO and puts a much greater strain on its resources,' Mr
Staple said.
Last year, the SFO brought prosecutions against 58 defendants and achieved a
conviction rate of 66 per cent - a marginal increase of 3 per cent over
1990-91.
The most common type of fraud handled by the SFO was frauds on investors,
followed by frauds on banks and creditors of companies. The use of Section 2
powers increased from 765 in 1990-91 to 793 in 1991-92.
Mr Staple called for the improvements in existing procedures rather than
root-and-branch reform. He backed the continuation of the jury system for
fraud cases and the use of criminal, rather than civil, proceedings in cases
of apparent dishonesty.
Mr Staple proposed the introduction of new rules to compel a defence to
state its case earlier during legal proceedings and suggested allowing all
SFO cases to be transferred from magistrate's to crown courts without
committal proceedings in order to bring cases to trial sooner.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Indian loss prompts bank review: Standard Chartered's head
office had 'no early warning' of securities scandal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT PESTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STANDARD Chartered warned yesterday that losses stemming from its
involvement in India's worst financial scandal could reach Pounds 100m.
Mr Malcolm Williamson, Standard's managing director, said the bank was
carrying out a review of its management procedures in the wake of the
debacle.
He said there had been 'no early warning' of a problem in India, where
Standard is the second biggest foreign bank with 32 offices.
He was thus checking control procedures to make sure similar situations
could not occur in the 54 other countries in which the bank has operations.
Late on Wednesday, only a week after Standard's London head office was first
alerted to a possible problem in Bombay, the bank said it was making a
provision of Pounds 50m. This would cover possible losses from its
involvement in an arcane form of Indian securities business.
However, Mr Williamson said yesterday that the estimated loss was
'arbitrary'. Standard's losses were 'unlikely' to be more than Pounds 100m,
he said, but they could turn out to be less than Pounds 50m.
The losses stem from Standard's exposure to Indian 'bank receipts' - a form
of IOU by which a bank promises to deliver government stock or equities to
another bank on a due date.
Mr Williamson said that until last week he had not been aware that Standard
was involved in issuing and taking this paper.
The sums of money involved were huge, said Mr Williamson, and they far
exceeded the credit limits by which the Bombay operation was supposed to
have operated.
He described these IOUs as unique to India and said they were designed as a
way of facilitating the settlement of securities transactions - settling a
stock bargain on the Bombay Exchange has traditionally been a lengthy and
arduous task.
At the beginning of the year, there was a sharp rise in the Bombay Stock
Exchange, which was coupled with an explosion in the volume of these IOUs in
circulation.
Standard's uncertainty about the extent of its losses stems from a number of
causes.
Executives sent from London, led by the bank's treasurer, its chief
inspector and its head of corporate loan recoveries, are sifting through
'trunk loads of paper'.
Mr Williamson said they were unsure whether all the IOUs were genuine. There
was a risk, he said, that significant amounts had been forged. The bank is
also uncertain whether the counterparties named in the transactions would be
able to honour their debts.

Look out Glyndebourne. A rival rural opera house will soon be springing up
in north-east England, if Northumberland miner's son Sir John Hall has
anything to do with it.
The man who turned 120 acres of wet ashes into Gateshead's MetroCentre will
retire from his Cameron Hall Developments company on reaching 60 next March,
handing over to his 33-year-old son Douglas.
'It's very difficult to step down when you have been in power for so long,
but I've made a decision - I've done nothing else but work since I was 16,'
he said from Lisbon.
But what he means to do as a sexagenarian might perhaps not strike everyone
as leisure.
Only part of his plan is the 'northern Glyndebourne', surrounded by what is
intended to be one of England's best gardens. It will be built at his home
Wynyard - the 144-year-old mansion on the Durham/Cleveland border, which he
bought in 1987 from the former coal barons, the Londonderry family.
Another project is to write the story of MetroCentre, still Europe's biggest
out-of-town shopping and leisure complex, which was sold to the Church
Commissioners five years ago.
Meanwhile, Hall will continue as chairman of Newcastle United football club
which, despite its troubles, he intends to expand into the 'greatest soccer
academy in Europe'. On the side, he'll also do consulting for Cameron Hall
and give some backstage help to the Tory party.

Oh the pressures of being creative] Take for instance Emilio Ambasz,

So versatile is he that, in his Pentagram/Design Museum lecture in London
this week, he presented himself - albeit in self-parody - as no fewer than
three visionary personalities. They were:
Emilio, naturalistic architect, builder of earth-covered dream-palaces for
millionaires in Montana, etc.
Ambasz, body-conscious designer, begetter of bendy toothbrushes and
fold-away TV sets for the populace.
Emilio Ambasz, who blends the talents of both the above and applies them to
such things as graphic design.
But perhaps the best summary of the whole was provided by his description of
the bit of himself that works as chief design consultant to US engine group
Cummins:
'Ambasz just encourages the engineers to have the courage to make their own
decisions. In 10 years with Cummins all he has actually designed is a little
oil-cap cover.'

Sir Terence Conran, for one, must be reflecting on the circumstances that
caused Michael Julien to quit as boss of Storehouse at just 54.
It took the company's creator about 18 months to decide he did not wish even
to function as a non-executive director alongside the ultra-ambitious
Julien, who came in as chief executive of Storehouse in 1988. Now Julien has
finally decided he cannot take his own frenetic pace, and from July will be
recovering from a persistent virus at his French farmhouse.
Julien is remembered even in his days as Midland's finance director as an
'exhausting' colleague to be around. But it was also there he really made
his mark - in extricating the UK clearer from the Crocker debacle.
Since then, he has continued to move at frenetic speed around the corporate
flashpoints of Britain - Eurotunnel, for a short time, and then to Guinness,
to help restore order after the big scandal.
But his driving ambition to rise from finance director into the driving seat
took him to Storehouse - at huge personal financial cost as he relinquished
his Guinness share options - to run the group just as the peak of the
consumer boom slipped inexorably into recession.
Boss at last, he failed to silence his doubters. While it took him mere
months to knock financial sense into the Storehouse balance sheet, his
legendary workaholic characteristics did not deliver any profound grasp of
retailing - in contrast his successor, soft-spoken American David Dworkin,
who had spells at a host of big name US retailers under his belt before he
began making a success as chairman of BhS.
Dworkin, chewing thoughtfully on a banana at yesterday's press briefing, is
not short of energy himself, but makes less noise.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Observer: A rush for black gold in the world's far frontiers
 -Oil companies are abandoning their traditional fields to explore higher
risk and higher return deposits
</HEADLINE>

Enterprise Oil is charting a passage through the dense jungles of Laos to
take seismic readings in an arduous search for oil. As the trail moves north
towards the border with Vietnam, engineers from the British company run the
risk of detonating unexploded mines with the monitors they carry to survey
the local geology.
In South America, British Petroleum faces possible disruption to its Dollars
200m oil-drilling programme in the foothills of Colombia from attacks by
left-wing guerrillas.
Across the globe, Chevron finally signed an agreement this week with the
government of Kazakhstan, a member of the Commonwealth of Independent
States, to develop a potentially huge oilfield in the Caspian Sea. The
company has been negotiating the deal for four years amid the shifting
allegiances of politics in the former Soviet Union.
In spite of such obstacles, the world's oil industry is increasingly keen to
develop what it describes as a 'frontier strategy' as it moves away from
fields which are running dry.
The drive for expansion has been matched by the opening of traditionally
closed markets by new governments which are more accommodating towards
western oil companies than their predecessors.
These governments - from Vietnam to Russia - are seeking to exploit mineral
resources to expand hard currency earnings as they reform their economies.
But faced with global credit shortages they realise that they will not find
the capital they need to develop their resources from the international
banking community alone.
The cash demands are huge. Dr Subroto, secretary-general of the Organisation
of Petroleum Exporting Countries (Opec), estimates that its 13 members alone
need some Dollars 25bn in capital over the next decade to complete their
capacity expansion plans to meet rising world demand.
Western oil companies can provide investment funds and sophisticated
technology in return for access to oil reserves. In exchange for exploration
licences, companies usually fund the costs of searching for oil and, if they
find it, pay the host government in oil and royalties.
Mr Dan Yergin, who heads Cambridge Energy Research Associates, an oil
consulting group, and the author of The Prize, a best-selling history of the
oil industry, calls this a 'new bargain' between countries and companies.
'It is the antithesis of what we saw in the 1970s when a wave of nationalism
across the world led to many of these companies being thrown out of
countries they were operating in,' he says. 'The great question then was -
what is the future of the traditional oil company outside of a few areas
such as the North Sea and North America?'
that their frontier strategy provides an answer to that question.
These companies are unlikely to see large production growth in the North
Sea, which has been so well explored that there is little chance of further
big discoveries. Similarly, they are leaving North America where the
environmental lobby has prevented them drilling in large parts of the
country.
Mr Allen Murray, chairman of Mobil, the second-largest US oil company, says
the most attractive areas for drilling in the US - offshore California and
parts of Alaska - have been closed to the industry following concerns over
pollution and environmental damage after the Exxon Valdez oil spill disaster
in March 1989. 'We're sitting on two tracts we've purchased, but are not
being allowed to drill because of pressure from local environmental
lobbies,' he said.
The search for new fields is given urgency by the failure of the large oil
companies to maintain reserves. 'So many companies have done a poor job of
replacing their reserves,' says Mr Robin West who advises companies on their
frontier strategies at Petroleum Finance Company, the Washington-based
consulting group. 'They are now being forced to turn from quick pay-out,
low-risk investment in the North Sea and North America to riskier
prospects.'
British Petroleum, for instance, failed to replenish its oil reserves during
much of the 1980s - the level of its proven oil reserves dropped by 4 per
cent last year - largely as a result of its concentration in the mature
oilfields of the North Sea and Alaska.
For British Petroleum, as for the other big companies, the elephant' - a
discovery estimated to contain 1bn barrels of oil or more. A find of this
size would secure long-term reserves and should ensure earnings growth for
at least a decade.
Mr Kenneth Derr, chairman of Chevron, says this is why his company was so
patient in its attempts to exploit Kazakhstan's Tengiz field. 'It is unique
in terms of size, and could have a meaningful impact on a company of our
size for a very long time.'
The Tengiz field is estimated to contain recoverable reserves of between six
and nine billion barrels - approximately twice the remaining recoverable
reserves in the UK. Once Chevron's joint venture project goes ahead its
share in Tengiz could raise the company's worldwide production of 1.2m
barrels per day by an estimated 10 per cent over three years and as much as
another 500,000 barrels per day by the turn of the century.
The lure of such large discoveries is a powerful incentive for companies to
focus on frontier drilling, but the risks are huge. Oil exploration is a
notoriously hit and miss affair in the best-researched locations and
frontier strategies increase the risk that companies will be investing in
dry holes.
'At the end of the day, you have some very high-tech data on the geology,
but you are making subjective judgments and half of the wells you drill are
dry,' said Mr Brian Lee, general manager of exploration at Lasmo.
Clyde Petroleum, a British exploration company, was disappointed when its
Dollars 8m investment in offshore drilling in Vietnam turned sour last year.
The company found a gas reservoir, but it turned out to be carbon dioxide.
British Petroleum hopes to minimise the risks of its frontier strategy by
targeting areas where its sophisticated technology can make a significant
contribution to extracting oil from known reserves. In many developing
countries, known oil deposits have not been exploited because of inadequate
technology and equipment.
The use of sophisticated technology, however, does not remove the political
risk in some countries, where governments can be unstable and liable to turn
hostile to western companies.
In spite of such risks and the costs, frontier strategy is a trend that will
continue. 'We are seeing virtually the full departure of the 15 largest
companies from drilling onshore in North America,' said Mr Tom Petrie,
industry analyst at Petrie Parkman, a US consulting group.
Their departure for new frontiers marks a return to the high-stakes
competition of the early years of oil exploration and may herald a shake up
in the ranks of the leading oil companies. For the 1990s, the industry's
winners and losers will probably depend on who takes the risks, who strikes
a deal in the republics of the former Soviet Union or who gets lucky in the
jungles of Laos.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Inspecting schools full time
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS disconcerting that Professor Stewart Sutherland, appointed last week
as Her Majesty's Chief Inspector of Schools in England, intends to combine
the post with his current one of vice-chancellor of the University of
London. The role of chief inspector was greatly enhanced by this year's
Schools Act, which rightly made regular and rigorous school inspections a
guarantor of standards and an underpinning for the Parent's Charter. With
the devolution of funding and control to head teachers and governors, and
the progressive weakening of the tutelage of local education authorities,
the inspectorate ought to become the linchpin of the new schools system. Its
leadership should not be considered a part-time job.
The Chief Inspector has three demanding tasks in hand. First, he has to
launch the new national inspectorate, as yet no more than a page of statute
enacted at the tail end of the last parliament in a messy compromise between
the House of Lords and the then education secretary. Second, he needs to
establish the modus operandi of the new inspectoral regime. Third, he must
ensure that the inspectors' work gives due attention to school management -
and not only to the quality of teaching.
The Schools Act set out to create a semi-privatised inspectorate. The Chief
Inspector is to license inspection teams, which may include existing local
authority teams (provided they are financially self-supporting); he will
seek tenders for each inspection and appoint the inspectors in each case,
but the school will foot the bill; and he will retain a small inspection
team of his own, which will intervene directly as the chief inspector sees
fit. He will also issue an annual report, and may make other public
recommendations, without the prior consent of the education secretary.
Licensing powers
Given the Chief Inspector's powers to license and appoint, the financial
link between schools and their inspectors should not cause undue concern.
More problematic is the supply of inspectors and the future of local
authority inspectorates. Teachers, like all professionals, are wont to
believe that only long-serving colleagues possess the requisite
understanding needed to judge their performance. Yet of all the professions,
there is none of which this is less true than teaching. The Chief
Inspector's task is to balance the necessity for inspectors to have a
thorough grasp of legal, curricular and financial facets with the attraction
of fresh faces.
Talent pool
Local authorities are one source of inspectors. But not the only one, and it
is to be hoped that dynamic teachers, management consultants, indeed parents
with a talent for the job, will find the rewards sufficiently attractive to
come forward. Provided the Chief Inspector takes seriously his
responsibility to train inspectors, and does not expect them to come
ready-made, direct classroom experience need be no bar.
The inspectorate will inevitably encroach on areas currently the preserve of
local authorities. One area of great importance is ensuring an adequate
supply of school places. Ministers hope that with funding more closely
related to pupil numbers, and capital funding directed towards the most
popular schools, market forces will do a large part of the job. They may do
so - but will not invariably succeed in raising standards in
poorly-performing schools, and will only rarely succeed in closing those
whose performance - or size - merits such drastic action. Consider the 17
per cent of primary schools which have fewer than 90 pupils. The recent
'three wise men' report on primary education stressed that every primary
school ought to have direct access to specialist expertise in all nine
national curriculum subjects. If they don't or can't, what should be done?
Closure, merger or joint provision  - without, perhaps, a local authority to
organise it? Inspectors will need to say.
Providing curriculum leadership and monitoring the quality of teaching is
only part of the job of today's head teachers. Along with the governors,
they also have to manage budgets which may run to several million pounds.
Inspection teams must include individuals with expertise in financial
management, and they need to inspect a school's governors as closely as its
teachers.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Leading Article: Cleaning up the farmyard
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE spectacle of European Community farm ministers on the point of yet
another stab at reforming the Common Agricultural Policy is never edifying.
Bleary-eyed from all-night negotiations, they still manage to summon up
energy for the struggle over concessions with which to soften the impact of
any deal on their own country's farmers. The result, invariably, is a mess.
So it was in Brussels yesterday. It remains profoundly unclear whether the
reform deal which the farm council struck last night - after ridiculous
last-minute blocking tactics by an Italian government that does not exist -
will succeed in breaking the deadlock over agriculture in the Uruguay round
of world trade talks. It is likewise moot whether ministers, in modifying
the original blueprint for reform produced by Mr Ray MacSharry, the farm
commissioner, have undermined some of its better intentions.
Yet there is reason to give at least one and a half cheers to yesterday's
accord. In accepting cuts in guaranteed prices of the order of 29 per cent
for cereals over three years and shifting the basis of agricultural
assistance from price support to direct income supplements, paid to most
farmers in return for removing a chunk of their land from production, the
farm council is doing much more than tinkering. It is laying the groundwork
for transforming the CAP into what it should have been from the outset: a
method of supporting farmers that does not turn the principles of world
trade completely on their head.
Export subsidies
The reform will bring prices of farm products more closely in line with
world levels, and thus reduce the need for wasteful export subsidies. It may
make a significant dent in the EC's embarrassing farm surpluses. And if it
is pursued relentlessly in the coming months and years, it should erode one
of the CAP's more pernicious aspects - its lack of transparency - by curbing
the proportion of assistance to farmers paid through indirect taxes on
consumers.
True, the transformation is at an early stage, and subject to many
questions. The direct income payments, for example, are almost certainly
cast too widely. They were originally proposed as a social and environmental
subsidy to small farmers: how can ministers justify giving them to the
'grain barons' of Norfolk or Schleswig-Holstein as well, in exchange for
taking only 15 per cent of their land out of production - a move which will
not cut output by as much, and whose effects will eventually be wiped out by
advances in productivity? Would it not be better to lower prices further
rather than attempt to police the bureaucratic nightmare of 'set-aside'?
Will income support, rather than simply providing transitional relief to
hard-pressed farmers, become a permanent and costly fixture? Importantly for
the Gatt talks, will the way ministers have twisted the MacSharry plan mean
that EC farm policy still has unacceptable trade-distorting effects?
US response
Understandably, this last question is uppermost in the minds of the EC's
American sparring partners. Yet it would be unwise for the US now to stick
to an unduly dogmatic position in the Uruguay round. After all, Washington
has over the years blamed many agricultural ills on the EC's high internal
prices and the large export subsidies the Community pays to bridge the gap
with the world market, while conveniently glossing over the trade-distorting
deficiency payments it makes to its own farmers. The EC's plan is not just a
different way of rigging the market in a business characterised by
market-rigging in virtually every part of the globe. The policy agreed
yesterday is, in fact, superior to the US system in important respects,
since its income supports are not directly related to output as they are in
the US.
If recognition of that helps smooth the way to a Gatt agreement encompassing
agriculture, then last night's deal will go down as a significant
achievement. If the EC now keeps up the momentum for reform  - by working to
make its food market more open to imports, by intensifying the price
pressure on products in surplus, by moving to eliminate set-aside in the
long term and by targeting support for farmers more closely on those who
need it - it will come to be seen as historic.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Reforms with a grain of sense: The EC's agricultural
package, brokered by Ray MacSharry, will cut output and food prices
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
It is a done deal - despite a little local difficulty in Italy. The Italian
wrangle - over illicit milk production - could put back the date of formal
agreement, but almost certainly will not. Nor will it in any case, obscure
the fact that the European Community has this week agreed what is by far the
most radical reform of the Common Agricultural Policy since its inception 30
years ago.
Around dawn yesterday morning, 50 hours into the last round of 18 months of
belligerent negotiations, Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, got
critical mass for his proposals: a clear majority for the reform among farm
ministers of the 12.
The EC has at last got to grips with the root problems of its grotesquely
profligate farm regime. The consequences are likely to be far-reaching.
The EC should soon start to reduce food output to what it needs, and what it
can sell abroad honestly, by competition rather than by undercutting
international producers through subsidised prices. Farmers can in general
look forward to more stable incomes, and consumers to cheaper food. The
countryside should gradually become cleaner, as the reform erodes financial
incentives for the intensive farming practised in much of Europe. It is
possible that debate on the future of European farming will be something
that lay people now comprehend.
The point of departure is that the EC has given itself the means to slice
into the food mountains for which the CAP has become infamous. Even the
modified MacSharry proposals contain the sinews needed to restrain the EC's
galloping overproduction of food, now running at about 24 per cent over
needs, and rising. The more muscular reform Mr MacSharry had originally
envisaged was sapped by the fierce outcry of the EC's farm lobbies, echoed
and targeted by their agriculture ministers. But what was achieved in
principle this week is still, a senior aide to the commissioner said
yesterday, 'son of MacSharry, definitely'.
The commitment to rein in overproduction will not, however, automatically
unlock a Uruguay Round world trade liberalisation deal, blocked by the
inability of the EC and US to agree on how much each side should cut farm
support within the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt). But such a
clear policy signal from the EC cannot easily be ignored by the US, and
could give the Round momentum when the two sides resume talks next week.
Irrespective of when a Gatt agreement finally emerges, the EC reform will,
by 1996 or 1997, have virtually eliminated the export subsidies Community
producers use to dump food on world markets. These subsidies are the high
octane fuel of the Gatt row, and the ruinous effects of EC dumping on its
industrialised and developing country competitors are the single most
insidious feature of the CAP.
'It will be very difficult now for the US not to understand that it has to
make some very major move in the direction of the Community,' judged Mr John
Gummer, the UK's agriculture minister. Mr MacSharry put it rather more
bluntly, but the EC message to Washington from this week's meeting was
uniform and clear: take it or leave it.
Mr MacSharry says: 'What we are involved in here is a totally different
philosophy to what has existed for 30 years.'
The reform cuts subsidised prices severely, moving them close to world
market levels. Cereals, for example, will drop in price by 29 per cent over
three years, in addition to automatic cuts to be decided this year as a levy
on overproduction - the remnant of the 1988 'stabilisers' regime which
failed to rein in oversupply.
Farmers will get full compensation for the cuts, paid directly, rather than
as now, through an inflated price guarantee. This will be paid on a per
hectare basis calculated on a past average yield which is frozen, rather
than on future output. This breaks the link between the support paid to
farmers and the increasing amounts which price support incites them to
produce. In addition, all but small farms will only get this compensation if
they take 15 per cent of their land out of production.
Previous reforms of the CAP, hailed as definitive at the time, failed
because they did not deal with the price support mechanism, which, allied to
exponential productivity growth, easily neutralised a succession of ad hoc
brakes on oversupply. Furthermore, CAP support prices have historically been
tailored to accommodate inefficient German agriculture, rather than being
set at French levels of competitivity. Now, prices are being set near market
levels.
The well-known structural deficiencies of the CAP have been magnified by the
EC's tendency to throw money at all problems arising from its farm regime.
Untold billions have been spent on wheezes like the the 'calf milk
replacement' scheme - whereby milk from the cow's udder enters the calf's
mouth entrepreneurially, first having been turned into powder, then protein
enriched, then back into milk and fed to the calf.
The EC Council of Ministers this week, though dominated by radicalism,
nevertheless resembled nothing so much as an Arab souk, with the
carpet-trading ministers extracting all manner of sweetheart deals from the
European Commission as the price of their support. Germany, the main
stumbling block to agreement, did particularly well. It got the nod for
increasing national subsidies to its farmers, and a special deal for the
eastern Lander which will probably link compensation to future production.
Added up, these concessions can be absorbed by a budget currently running
well under its limit for this year of Ecu35.3bn.
But two questions arise out of this horse-trading. Are these additions to
the reform the obstacles of the future? And are the price cuts in the final
compromise deep enough?
None of the concessions threatens the integrity of the reform's structure.
Mr MacSharry was at his most aggressive and canny through the long,
night-time negotiations he insisted on conducting with ministers
individually to avoid alliances against him. He knew what he was giving
away. The eastern Lander, for instance, have a rich cereal-growing tradition
which could bring more unwanted grains on to the market. Except, as a senior
British diplomat pointed out, the incentive to do so has just been removed.
The cuts are probably not deep enough, and it is likely that new reductions
will be needed further down the road. Mr Brian Gardner, an expert on the
CAP, draws the parallel with the Uruguay Round bringing agriculture into
world trade discipline for the first time. 'As in the Gatt negotiations,' he
argues, the CAP reform 'will have established the principles for further
reductions.'
Farmers themselves will suffer less from these cuts than they would under
present arrangements, which have forced their income into secular decline.
Very simply, the more money the EC has laid out in price support, the
greater the overhang on the market has become, and the less farmers have
earned. CAP outlays are channelled as much into warehouses as to farmers. An
independent study for the Commission shows that farm income will now fall by
about 3 per cent less than it would have done without reform.
The effect on food prices is disputed, not least by a food processing
industry wary of raising public expectations about forthcoming price cuts.
Most specialists believe consumers can expect back at least a quarter of the
Dollars 83.6bn subsidy paid to European farmers in 1990 - in addition to the
Dollars 62.7bn they contributed towards the EC budget and national
treasuries. The Commission translates this into 15 per cent to 20 per cent
cuts on pork and poultry, 15 per cent cheaper beef, 7 per cent to 8 per cent
reductions on butter, and about 3 per cent off bread.
All this is of a piece with what should develop as a farming culture more
inclined to embrace competition. When Mr Louis Mermaz of France, until last
October the MacSharry plan's most adamant foe, said yesterday: 'We accept
the proposal . . . we are very satisfied,' it is clear that the competition
penny has dropped.
France, the EC's agri-superpower accounting for nearly half Community grain
exports, was in the end frightened that prices would not come down far
enough, and that quotas would be used to limit production, blunting its
competitive edge. The French know they can compete with the most efficient
world producers, especially in the context of multilateral subsidy
disarmament offered by Gatt.
A successful Uruguay Round, however, has by no means been ensured by the
EC's reform.
The US remains reluctant to exempt for more than six years the direct
compensation to farmers from the Gatt's scheduled subsidy cuts. This is even
though Brussels insists that its reform mechanism will deliver more cuts
than the Uruguay Round 'final act' actually requires. Gatt requires, for
example, 36 per cent cuts in export subsidies over six years, whereas the EC
should have all but eliminated them within half that time.
Washington and Geneva have a point, in that the direct payments, although
partially decoupled from production, will still go into a single farm pot,
and will eventually show up in output. That is another reason why this
reform is not definitive - but neither can the Gatt pretend to anything like
the definitive liberalisation of farm trade. The two processes have to be
harnessed together, and may well be.
But the Gatt farm chapter now seems to turn on whether the US will allow the
EC to average the required 24 per cent cut in the volume of subsidised
exports across sectors, rather than insisting it apply to each individual
product.
The EC wants to be able to cut more on products like barley and skimmed milk
powder, and thereby be able to export more of its most competitive or high
added-value produce, like wheat and cheese.
There is nothing to suggest the US will go for this. Concern for its own
wheat and soya exports is one root of the whole farm subsidies imbroglio.
Now that the EC is cutting its cereals and oilseed prices, Washington may
have all the more reason to fear opening any sort of gap for the Community.
But MacSharry's reform has established one thing pretty clearly: the ball is
now in Washington's court.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Arts: Bheki Mseleku - Jazz
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARRY BOOTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
South African-born pianist Bheki Mseleku is an absorbing and absorbed
musician who has attracted a good deal of praise on tour in the UK this
year. Rightly so: although his playing skirts the fashionable 'world music'
tag attached to so many other black South African expatriates, he
nevertheless brings a new un-American dimension to swinging post-bop lines.
Having started out with other South African luminaries - Hugh Masekela,
Johnny Dyani and Chris MacGregor - it took the attention of New York's
M-Basers and an adventurous new record label to bring Mseleku out in his own
right. Marvin 'Smitty' Smith, the collective's drummer, spotted Mseleku
upstairs at Ronnie Scott's and wound up collaborating on the 37-year-old's
debut album, Celebration (World Circuit WC 028). It was Smith, along with
fellow Americans Charnett Moffatt (upright bass) and Jean Toussaint (tenor),
and English flautist Eddie Parker who joined him at the Elizabeth Hall on
the South Bank.
Showcasing a selection of Mseleku compositions from the album (which also
features saxophonists Courtney Pine and Steve Williamson as well as American
bassist Michael Bowie), the quintet swung through soulful pieces like
'Angola', Bheki scatting absent-mindedly, before reverting to the piano trio
format and a lip-curling slap bass solo from Moffatt. A thoughtful and
sensitive improviser whose volume balance sometimes suffers as a result of
his self-contained musing, Mseleku also has the Horace Silver touch for
pushing his sidemen along with carefully placed ringing blue notes.
The South African's talent cannot miss with this line-up, of course. Moffatt
and Smith make for a jumping rhythm section and Parker's (much under-used)
virtuosity on two flutes add a delicate edge to Mseleku's rich writing.
Ex-Jazz Messenger Toussaint, whose taut tenor parts in 'Monk's Move' had the
leader bouncing off his stool, is another World Circuit artist with a new
album, What goes around (WC 029), well worth investigating.
If the holy trinity of jazz is the swinging and sensitive piano trio,
Mseleku extends and strengthens the tradition. Add to the African-tinged
soulfulness reeds and flute and you have a quintet for the Nineties.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Arts: Boris Godunov and The Return of Ulysses - British
opera revivals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS and MAX LOPPERT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Opera North's staging of Boris Godunov, first seen in 1989, has returned
with its glories preserved. Ian Judge's production has been carefully
revived by Jonathan Alver; John Tomlinson is again resplendent in the title
role. It remains a brutally direct, intense account, given razor-sharp focus
by the use of Musorgsky's original 1869 version of the opera - just seven
scenes lasting barely two and a half hours, and each rendered as a vivid
snapshot in a thrilling chronicle of Russian history.
Inevitably one regrets the loss along the way of some of the material
Musorgsky added in his subsequent attempts to make his creation more
politically and operatically acceptable - no Polish act, no character
numbers in the nursery scene. But there is no doubting the dramatic urgency
of the original scheme, or that the narrative thrust of the work emerges
more clearly - the two protagonists of Boris Godunov, it reminds us, are the
tsar himself and the Russian people. It is those two components which the
Opera North account catches so excitingly.
The Coronation scene, the second panel in this particular pageant, finally
set Wednesday's performance ablaze and began to exert the dramatic grip
which never slackened afterwards. The opening at the monastery had been slow
to come to life; in the opening exchanges too co-ordination between stage
and pit was sometimes approximate. But then Paul Daniel's conducting gained
pungency and attack, Tomlinson's first phrases as Boris compelled attention,
and the chorus began to direct its intensity out into the auditorium.
Each of the subsequent scenes contains beautifully crafted, intelligently
thought-out performances - grave, articulate Pimen from Matthew Best, never
at all histrionic; nimble, clear-toned Grigory from Paul Charles Clarke; an
inn scene stacked with cartoon grotesques and headed by Andrew Shore's
larger-than-life Varlaam and Ann Howard's eye-rolling Innkeeper. Jeffrey
Lawton's Shuisky is beautifully fluent, insidiously crafty, Mark Curtis's
Simpleton is uncomplicatedly affecting. Ann Taylor-Morly's Feodor and
Melanie Armitstead's Xenia are attractive, not at all caricatured.
Most of all there is Tomlinson, in wonderful clarion voice, making sure
every word carries through the theatre and wringing every last drop of
theatricality from his haunted visions. It is a masterly portrayal, the true
focus of this compelling production.
English National Opera has revived its 1989 Return of Ulysses, which thus
completes the trilogy of Monteverdi stagings by David Freeman seen in London
over the past two months. In 1989 this struck me as one of the most
heartfelt, powerful and boldly immediate of British Monteverdi productions
in living memory.
Its return aroused excited expectation, which on Wednesday was let down by
plodding, lumpily inexpert musical direction, and by the second-rate quality
of much of the singing. In Monteverdi, staging counts for much - and
Freeman's richly dramatised ensemble vision, at once ancient and modern,
warmly Levantine in its textures, still achieves one of his most
imaginatively expansive and fine-grained pieces of operatic theatre - but
singing counts for no less.
Most of the cast come new to their roles; many of them must be reckoned
simply inadequate Monteverdi singers, at least for a house of Coliseum size.
Among the gods and suitors a number of coarse-toned basses and strident or
cloudy mezzos smirched the picaresque enchantment of every scene in which
they appeared. The feebleness of the Minerva was a particular hardship; the
original performer had been Sally Burgess, gleaming with wit and vocal
lustre, and she was badly missed.
Still, not all is gloom. The old shepherd Eumaeus, one of the most wonderful
smaller roles in this wonderfully well-supplied opera, is taken now by Neil
Jenkins; he is a commanding Monteverdian (I remember with undimmed
admiration his Kent Opera Ulysses in the late 1970s), and his focused energy
and disciplined passion light up the stage.
Paul Nilon's Telemachus is dry-toned but eloquent, Adrian Thompson's
'paunchy cavalier' Irus gruesomely fascinating, Michael Chance's
countertenor Amphinomous a ray of elegance amid the encircling vocal murk.
And for Anthony Rolfe Johnson in the title role and Jean Rigby as Penelope -
the 1989 leading couple, thankfully restored to the revival  - no praise can
be too high. Both sink their beautiful voices and strong theatrical
personalities even more deeply into their roles than first time round; more
than ever, the dark, achingly sad beauty of Miss Rigby's low-register
plaints and the physical and vocal thrill of Mr Rolfe Johnson's
extraordinary stage magnetism provide the show's most arresting and powerful
rewards.
Boris Godunov, Theatre Royal, Nottingham; further performance May 23.
Touring to Sheffield, Manchester and Leeds. Sponsored by Nottinghamshire
County Council.
The Return of Ulysses, sponsored by The Mercers' Company; in repertory at
the Coliseum until June 19.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Technology: Crossing the lines - Hugo Dixon explains the
commotion surrounding the way Britain's telephone numbers are allocated
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
It is easy to see why Oftel, the telecommunications regulator, is annoyed.
Eight months after announcing a new telephone numbering system for the UK
with full backing of the industry, the consensus which underpinned its
decision is unravelling.
The ensuing furore is complicating Sir Bryan Carsberg's last days as Oftel's
Director General before he leaves to head the Office of Fair Trading next
month. He would like to resolve the dispute but is anxious not to rush into
a decision which might in several years be seen as a ghastly error.
The unravelling of the original consensus is almost entirely the work of
Richard Cox, a Cardiff-based telecommunications consultant. Over the past
year, he has unearthed information which challenges some of the premises on
which Oftel's decision was based. 'If the information now available had been
provided two years ago, there would never have been any question of approval
being given to the number change,' he claims.
The planned number change involves putting a '1' after the initial '0' in
each telephone code. For example, York's 0904 code would become 01904. The
idea is to create more numbers to deal with a shortage caused by the growth
of new services.
The Telecommunications Managers Association (TMA), which represents large
users, has taken up Cox's arguments. In a confidential paper to Oftel
earlier this year, it said that the total cost of the code change would be
Pounds 3bn, as equipment was modified or even scrapped, stationery reprinted
and the public informed.
Moreover, the TMA argued that the change would be anti-competitive and would
not even achieve its objective. It has urged Oftel to delay the change from
1994 until 1996 and to review the plan from scratch.
But the Telecommunications Users' Association, another user group, and BT,
Britain's largest telecommunications group, strongly back the original
decision. And, although Oftel has had to pause to reassess details of the
code change such as whether it could be phased in to reduce disruption to
customers, it believes there is no better alternative.
Those supporting the change argue that delay will confuse customers and
stifle the growth of telecommunications services because it would be
impossible to find new numbers. They also say that the TMA's costings are
exaggerated - Oftel has put the total cost at only Pounds 1bn - and that
this cost would be incurred even if there were a delay.
But what has most annoyed Oftel is its view that critics have reneged on a
consensus that was reached after three years' discussion in the Telephone
Numbering Administration Board (TNAB), a group which included the TMA.
Although there is little chance of the scheme being scrapped, the storm has
exposed defects in the way Oftel operates. The most important of these is
the climate of secrecy.
'It is difficult to see how (TNAB), operating with undue secrecy and with no
formal channel of accountability, can be seen as having achieved open
consultation,' the TMA said in its paper to Oftel.
TNAB met behind closed doors and for long periods Oftel refused to tell
journalists what was happening. Moreover, data to support the main
contention that the UK is running out of numbers and a full explanation of
how the code change will solve the alleged problem have still not been made
public.
At first sight, the idea that the UK is running out of numbers seems odd.
The current numbering system - consisting of a '0' followed by up to nine
digits - has a theoretical capacity of 1bn numbers of which only 30m are
being used.
The reason for this inefficiency is that numbers are allocated in two
stages. First, codes are given to cities, rural communities and
non-geographical services such as mobile communications and freephone
services. Then numbers are given to customers.
The problem is that the numbers are unevenly spread, with some cities packed
full and rural areas almost empty. Moreover, there are few unused codes left
for new services and overflowing cities.
Critics of the change say the shortage is not too severe because customers
could be fairly easily moved from codes which are little used, freeing up
extra codes for busy cities. A code such as 0393 for Foula in Scotland,
which now has 25 customers, could theoretically accommodate 1m.
Advocates of the change say this type of 'code recovery' is expensive and
would not create enough numbers. But this claim is difficult to judge
because Oftel has refused to publish information on either the future demand
for numbers or the state of supply. The only person who has is Cox and his
figures (see graph) seem to support the contention that 'code recovery'
could buy breathing space.
Cox's other contention is that the code change will not solve the numbers
shortage. It will only be the first step in a series of changes which will
cause further disruption.
The essential point is that putting a '1' after the initial '0' will in
itself achieve nothing except make numbers longer. It is only when other
digits such as 2, 3 and 4 are inserted that the supply of numbers increases.
But no decision has been taken on how these other digits will be used. And
there has been no public debate on what the numbering system will eventually
look like.
Will Britain move to a uniform system of 10 digits as in the US or continue
with the current system where some numbers have more digits than others?
What will happen to cities that run out of numbers? Five - Leeds,
Nottingham, Bristol, Sheffield and Leicester - have nearly run out. BT has
put forward a plan that would involve such cities changing both their
numbers and codes.
Oftel believes it is premature to answer such questions because it is
unclear how technology and the market will develop in the future. The main
aim should be to build enough flexibility into the system so that it can
last for perhaps half a century.
The snag is that by taking a decision which sets the framework for the
future without thinking through the consequences, Oftel may soon find itself
boxed in. Although the code change will be flexible in the sense of
providing many options for future development, it may be that none is
particularly palatable.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Technology: New breed of PC on the scene
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A new class of lightweight portable personal computer is emerging with the
launch of the first A-5 sized machines from Italy's Olivetti and Vortec,
part of Korea's Samsung group.
The new machines are designed to fill the gap between palmtop computers,
which generally have small keyboards and screens, and the larger A-4
notebook computers which dominate the growing portable computer market.
According to an Olivetti/Dataquest estimate, the market in western Europe
this year for the high-end palmtop and entry-level notebook computers which
the A-5 or 'companion' machines are designed to replace, could be as high as
300,000 units.
Not surprisingly, some established portable PC manufacturers question
whether there is a market for the new machines. They point out that lighter
and cheaper notebooks and more sophisticated palmtops such as the new
PC-compatible Sharp 3,000 are already arriving.
However, both Olivetti and Vortec are convinced that the particular features
of their new machines - large-sized LCD screens, only slightly scaled-down
Qwerty keyboards, hard-disk storage and full compatibility with the desktop
PC MS-Dos standard all squeezed into a small 1kg package - will make them
attractive options.
Olivetti's new machine, dubbed the 'Quaderno' (which means 'schoolbook') is
being produced by its Pegasus joint venture with Tokyo-based Y-E Data. It
will run for eight hours using a rechargeable NiCad battery pack - double
the battery life of most notebooks.
Its most distinguishing feature aside from its Dollars 1,100 (Pounds 620)
price, is its ability to record and play back sound. As Fabrizio Gimona,
marketing director for Olivetti's PC range, puts it: 'You can even talk to
the Quaderno.'
Vortec's Handbook PC also measures about half the size of a conventional
notebook PC and weighs 1kg. It comes with a bigger hard disk and a more
powerful processor but will cost about Pounds 1,500 when it goes on sale
next month.
Both machines boast a suite of built-in functions including communications
software which allows them to exchange data with a desktop PC using a
plug-in cable.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Management: Yes, Prime Minister - Lucy Kellaway slips past
security cameras and through a discreet door to find Britain's top civil
servant. Sir Robin Butler is a mandarin who really does say
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LUCY KELLAWAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
When Mrs William Waldegrave was shown around Whitehall recently by her
husband, the new minister for the Civil Service, she was taken aback by Sir
Robin Butler's office. The top mandarin's room was larger and finer than her
husband's, she noted coolly.
You do not need to be the boss's wife to register that Sir Robin, cabinet
secretary and head civil servant, works somewhere special.
From the stately entrance to the Cabinet Office at 70 Whitehall, the visitor
is in for an experience. First come the top-security electronic entrance
gates. These open on to grimy modern corridors which lead to the Tudor
'cockpit passage'. The mood changes again: deep red carpet, oil paintings
and outsized marble fireplaces reveal the source of power is not far away.
After some delay, Sir Robin emerges from the connecting passage to 10
Downing Street, where he has been busy with plans to make public a little of
what goes on behind that discreet door.
'So sorry to have kept you,' he says, smiling graciously. Sir Robin seems a
cardboard cut-out of the old-style mandarin: courteous, intelligent,
well-informed. He has adapted himself to the whims of four different prime
ministers and is more than equal to making visitors at ease.
He opens the door into his office. The sun streams in from three large
windows overlooking a well-known part of London. The Civil Service may be
becoming more open, yet the exact location of its top people's offices
remains secret.
The room is magnificent. Larger than a squash court, and with a soaring,
pink-domed ceiling, it was designed by William Kent in 1736 for the
Treasury. 'It is not just big and grand, it is aesthetically pleasing,' says
Sir Robin, uncharacteristically stating the obvious.
Despite the pressures of his timetable, the cabinet secretary seems without
a care as he describes how the room occupies the site of Henry V's cockpit,
and how later, Queen Anne was held there under house arrest. More recently
still, it was the model for Sir Humphrey's office in the TV series, 'Yes
Minister'.
The sense of tradition is so pervasive that there is little scope for
successive incumbents to make their mark. Yet even if Sir Robin had a free
hand, he surely would not have changed it much. He certainly would not have
followed racier Treasury colleagues in employing young London designers for
a re-fit. Instead, the man slots naturally into his surroundings. His
innovations have been modest: he has put blue velvet chairs and sofas round
the fireplace where he sits when he is 'fixing things with people, or
receiving international visitors'. He uses his fine desk only when alone.
'I'd rather be chummy than domineering,' he says.
He has also removed the photographs of statesmen favoured by his
predecessor, Sir Robert Armstrong. In their place sit snaps of his family
and of their house in Cornwall, incongruous under a glowering portrait of
Handel.
His most notable addition has been a stag's head - a golf trophy won by
himself and Terry Burns (now permanent secretary to the Treasury). They no
longer hold the title, but Sir Robin - who is still a keen sportsman and
cycles around town to meetings - keeps the trophy as Treasury staff found it
offensive on animal rights grounds.
The personal effects suggest that their owner is correct but not stuffy.
Indeed, in his old job at the Treasury, he became so frustrated at the dirt
on his windows that he abseiled down the outside of the building to clean
them.
'It was a threat. I said that if no one cleans them, I'd do it myself. There
was already a bolt on the wall, and I attached myself to it with a safety
harness.' He takes promises seriously, it seems.
On his first day in the Cabinet Office, Sir Robin 'cowered into the corner',
but now he feels so comfortable that he fancies his stately chamber has 'the
sense of a house'.
He says he likes the mixture of 'history and high-tech', although to the
visitor, the latter is scarcely in evidence. There are a few telephones,
some of which have innocuous-looking scrambler devices attached. Otherwise,
a television and a Dictaphone are the most advanced pieces of equipment.
There are no computer screens - Sir Robin does not know how to use them.
Instead he relies on his staff.
Next door, in a powder pink corner room, three brainy looking women are hard
at work. To help with his fully-packed day and to deal with cabinet matters
he has a PA, an assistant PA, a diary secretary, someone to look after his
papers and four secretary-typists.
From the atmosphere in both rooms, you might be in the 1950s or 60s, rather
than the decade of the Citizen's Charter and the management revolution in
Whitehall. Yet Sir Robin insists that things have changed: 'The job has
become much more of a rush, there is greater openness of access, there are
many more people coming in here to see me.'
He is not always playing host, however. As head of the Civil Service, he
sometimes dons his management, rather than policy, hat and goes visiting.
Whenever the prime minister is out of town, he calls on rank-and-file
government workers.
What does he think of the squalid conditions that some of them work in? Not
perfect, but getting better, he says, ever the diplomat. 'Local staff have
their own budgets and can take their own decisions. That has improved
standards. People work better and with more pride if they are proud of their
environment,' he says. Evidently, it is true of him.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Management: Why it is the little things that matter so much
 -Christopher Lorenz says that many attempts at corporate culture change are
doomed to failure
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The past decade has seen a flood of articles, books and speeches trumpeting
the importance of altering a company's culture to improve its competitive
performance. There can hardly be a more popular buzz phrase today, except
perhaps for 'total quality' and 'change management' - both of which
themselves involve extensive culture change.
So one would have thought that most top managers now realised that their
companies can seldom achieve substantial strategic and organisational change
without also altering their culture. They would also have some idea of how
to achieve this.
Not so. Whatever they may profess, many companies persist in their old,
ineffective ways, trying to accomplish strategic change by merely changing
the systems and structures of their organisation. They become preoccupied
with its rational, 'hard' aspects.
They fail to confront the fact that its decisions are often deeply
influenced by 'soft' factors, notably the large number of unspoken
assumptions and beliefs which managers in the organisation share about 'the
way we do things around here'. As a result, their efforts to achieve change
are resisted, and often fail.
This is one of the main conclusions of a study carried out over several
years by Gerry Johnson, a professor at Britain's Cranfield School of
Management. Some of its results are reported in an article in Long Range
Planning Journal* and others - including ways of overcoming the problem -
were discussed in a set of papers presented at a recent conference on
'managing strategically', held jointly between Cranfield and the
London-based Strategic Planning Society.
'Even when managers do realise the importance of culture,' Johnson
complains, they try 'to reduce it to better communications, mission
statements and notices hung on people's walls.
'That's not enough. Culture change needs to be made operational in all sorts
of mundane and detailed ways,' he stresses. 'Unless it affects the
day-to-day behaviour of individuals throughout the organisation, it won't
work.'
To help companies overcome this barrier, Johnson and his colleagues audit
the various distinctive features of what he calls the organisation's
'culture web'. This brings to the surface, for discussion and potential
change, such closely related 'soft' aspects of culture as:
'rituals and routines' (such as, in some consultancies, the 'need' for
partners to sign anything that goes to clients );
'stories and myths' (such as legendary leaders and mavericks, plus past
successes and failures);
'symbols'. This covers not only obvious things such as separate dining rooms
and parking spaces for top managers, and the addressing of top executives by
their initials or 'sir'. It also includes company-specific language which
reinforces entrenched attitudes.
Among various colourful examples, Johnson cites a traditional tendency of
British Rail planners to refer to passengers disparagingly as 'pedestrian
freight'. Johnson's 'culture web' also covers the more widely- recognised
'hard' aspects of company culture, such as control systems, power structures
and organisation structures.
Culture audits of this kind are necessary, he says, because the unspoken
aspects of culture tend not to be made explicit through the debates on
strategy that normally take place within most organisations. This is partly
why most companies only confront such 'taken-for-granted' facets - if at all
 -when they hit a crisis, or when the chief executive stimulates one.
'The very surfacing of these blockages means you can start addressing the
question of how you might change them', says Johnson.
As an example of the intractable nature of unspoken cultural assumptions,
beliefs and behaviour patterns in an organisation, Johnson cites the example
of a successful down-market retailer whose performance suffered badly in the
1980s as its competitors revitalised themselves. Attempts to shift towards
more fashionable goods came painfully slowly in the face of a set of
unspoken beliefs and behaviours which assumed a low-cost, high-volume buying
approach, including Far East sourcing.
Shops had always been seen within the company as places to dispose of the
merchandise which had been bought: there was little comprehension of
marketing.
Outsiders who had been brought in to create such changes did not last very
long. Market research reports were re-interpreted to make sense in terms of
what Johnson calls the 'taken-for-granted' assumptions of how to trade.
Even when managers recognised intellectually the cultural constraints under
which they were labouring, a set of factors hampered significant change, and
even questioning of the status quo. These included political and ritualistic
behaviour, controls on costs, the hierarchical nature of the organisation,
managerial in-breeding, and all sorts of other links with the past.
The early attempts by the company to be 'more fashionable' took the form of
trying to copy fashionable merchandise from UK boutiques, have it cheapened
in the Far East, and distributed through low-cost distribution channels.
'It was a merchandise and buying-driven response, rather than anything to do
with the expectations of customers,' says Johnson. 'Nor did it address the
ambience of stores, the service of staff, the behaviour of managers in head
office, nor the fundamental quality of the product range.' The company began
to change, but was acquired by a bigger stores group.
When Johnson's 'cultural web' mapping technique was then applied, the senior
executives revealed that one of the biggest blockages of all was themselves,
and various 'routines' that they used. These included their lack of
readiness to challenge each other and their emphasis on pragmatic, rather
than analytical, decisions.
Despite this revelation, and the subsequent departure of several top
executives, the company has never quite made the strategic breakthrough
which it might have done, says Johnson. It has continued to stumble up
against its remaining cultural hurdles.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: PM denies failure on repossessions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR John Major yesterday denied that the government's scheme to help people
facing home repossessions had been a 'complete flop' as he clashed in the
Commons with Mr Neil Kinnock, the Labour leader, during Prime Minister's
questions.
Under a scheme announced last December, the government agreed to pay the
mortgage interest element of social security benefits direct to lenders.
In return, the mortgage lenders agreed not to repossess the homes of people
covered by such benefits.
In addition the lenders would set aside up to Pounds 1bn for
mortgage-to-rent schemes under which housing associations would buy the
homes of repossessed borrowers and rent them back to their former owners.
Put on the defensive by Mr Kinnock's charge, Mr Major retorted by saying
that 'only about half a per cent' of home-owners had had their homes
repossessed, and claimed that repossessions often resulted from domestic
difficulties within families.
In a testy series of exchanges, he defended measures taken by Mr Norman
Lamont, the chancellor, maintaining that they were helping to alleviate
problems.
Many mortgage lenders had agreed not to repossess homes where mortgage
interest was covered by income support, he said.
He finally rounded on Mr Kinnock, accusing him of being hypocritical on the
issue. 'It is your party that would have denied 1.5m people from becoming
homeowners in the first place,' he said.
Mr Kinnock had opened by inquiring whether Mr Major would still claim, as he
had in January, that the government had stopped housing repossessions
'before Christmas'.
Pointing out that Mr Lamont had promised that the government's rescue plan
would reduce repossessions by 40,000, Mr Kinnock said despite this, 'action
was started' against 42,000 families in the first three months of this year.
Branding the government scheme a 'complete flop', he urged the prime
minister to 'start taking steps to ensure we have an effective scheme before
thousands more families are put out of their homes'.
For the small percentage affected, repossession was a '100 per cent
tragedy', while many more families were under 'intense pressure' on mortgage
payments.
'It is necessary in a country where there could be 80,000 repossessions
again this year for the government to introduce a proper mortgage rescue
scheme.'
The exchange was prefaced by a question from Mr Chris Smith, a shadow
Treasury spokesman, who urged the government to allow local authorities to
use more than Pounds 6bn of capital receipts in their hands to build more
homes.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Move to fixed terms is ruled out
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A MOVE to fixed-term parliaments and the ending of the prime minister's
right to choose the date of general elections was rejected by Mr John Major
yesterday.
He firmly rebuffed a suggestion by a Labour MP that pre-determined general
election dates would increase democracy.
There was a five-year limit to the length of parliaments, Mr Major said, but
the element of flexibility was 'part of our constitution'.
'It is right, it is helpful and it is not going to be changed,' he added at
prime minister's questions.
The Labour party backs fixed-term parliaments, and Mr Major's comments will
disappoint MPs who had hoped his commitment to reforming the Commons
procedures would extend to the calling of general election dates.
Mr Andrew MacKinlay, Labour MP for Thurrock, told Mr Major that 'the
capacity of any prime minister to manipulate the decision-making process,
and choose a time to create a window of opportunity, is wholly undemocratic
and betrays your bogus reforming credentials'.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Council cash delay confirmed
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
A DELAY in the usual arrangements for announcing next year's council
spending was confirmed yesterday by Mr John Redwood, local government
minister.
Ministers usually give in July the overall figures for local authority
spending.
Mr Redwood said, however, that the move to the council tax and the change in
local authorities' responsibility for community care were special factors
that made it sensible to postpone the announcement until the autumn, when
the detailed arrangements will also be published.
Normally, the overall figures are used in discussions during the summer
between local authority associations and environment department officials.
The delay will reinforce fears that the arrangements for the first year of
council tax will be made at the last minute.
Mr Redwood said the scale of a transitional relief scheme for the move to
council tax could not be properly assessed until the valuation exercise had
been completed, and that the necessary information would not be available in
July.
The postponement has been seen by Labour MPs as a sign that local government
will face a particularly tough settlement in this year's public spending
round.

THE Irish government was rebuked by a Northern Ireland Office minister
yesterday for publicly urging the withdrawal of the Parachute Regiment from
Northern Ireland, Ralph Atkins writes.
Mr Michael Mates, the security minister, told MPs that 'megaphone diplomacy
in this sort of case seldom helps'. The 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement
established a joint secretariat through which disputes could be resolved in
private, he said.
Mr David Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, called for the regiment to be
withdrawn from the province after clashes between soldiers and civilians in
Coalisland, County Tyrone, last weekend.
At Commons questions, Mr Mates confirmed that the regiment would remain in
the province and told MPs that 'it is best if these matters are kept for
private discussions, and we have a mechanism for doing so'.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: BCCI report set for delay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PUBLICATION of the Bingham report into the collapse of the Bank of Credit
and Commerce International looks set to be delayed until late next month or
July - almost a year after the inquiry was set up.
Treasury officials warned yesterday that the conclusions of Lord Justice
Bingham might not be released until after the Commons rises for summer
recess - probably the middle of July.
The delay, to what could be a deeply embarrasing report for the government,
appears to have resulted from the enormous scope of the investigation,
covering the roles of the regulatory authorities and ministers in uncovering
fraud at BCCI.
When he announced the setting up of the inquiry last July, Mr Norman Lamont,
the chancellor, said he hoped its conclusions would be released before the
general election. But that timetable became impossible to achieve when Mr
John Major set April 9 as election day.
The Treasury subsequently said publication would be in 'spring or early
summer, it is hoped.'
Officials yesterday said that, although no date for publication had been
fixed, June or July were likely but early June looked optimistic.
Both Downing Street and the Treasury confirmed that it remains the
government's intention to publish as much of Lord Justice Bingham's report
as possible. Parts that will not be released will be those that might
prejudice possible criminal trials or which must remain confidential under
Banking Acts.
The Bingham inquiry was set up amid fierce political rows in the Commons
over the extent of the government's responsibility in the affair. It was
supposed to cover how much minsters knew and at what stage.
A cross-party report by the Commons Treasury select committee before the
general election was critical of the Bank of England for failing to act
sooner against BCCI but ministers escaped blame.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Tories win Maastricht victory -
Bill given second Commons reading with comfortable majority Opponents plan
to continue fight Hurd assurance on sovereignty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVOR OWEN and DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TWENTY-TWO Conservative rebels voted against the government last night as
the European Communities (Amendment) Bill, which ratifies the Maastricht
treaty, received a second Commons reading with a comfortable majority of 244
(336-92).
A total of 61 Labour MPs, including tellers, defied the leadership's advice
not to vote and opposed the motion. These included Mr George Howarth, the MP
for Knowsley North, who resigned his position as a frontbench housing
spokesman in order to do so.
Among the Tory rebels were former ministers such as Mr John Biffen and Mr
Michael Spicer, and other prominent Euro-sceptics including Sir Teddy Taylor
and Mr Tony Marlow, the MPs for Southend East and Northampton North
respectively.
Two Labour MPs - Mr Tam Dalyell, the MP for Linlithgow, and Mr Andrew
Faulds, the MP for Warley East - voted for the government motion. Earlier, a
Labour amendment was defeated with a government majority of 99 (360-261).
Opening the debate, Mr Douglas Hurd said that when Britain took over the
presidency of the European Community in July it would give a lead in
developing the move away from centralisation signalled by the treaty.
The foreign secretary told doubters on the Tory backbenches: 'The ball is at
our feet. We have a treaty now which more closely mirrors British priorities
than any of its predecessors'.
Mr Hurd sought to allay the fears of Euro-sceptics that the treaty would
lead relentlessly to a centralised Europe with perhaps a single executive
and a single parliament, with national parliaments steadily stripped of
their functions.
The foreign secretary insisted that the treaty reinforced the position of
national parliaments by limiting the areas in which the Community could
legislate, and by encouraging the greater involvement of the states.
Without mentioning Mrs Margaret Thatcher, the former prime minister, by
name, Mr Hurd played down her fears about growing German dominance in the
EC.
Mrs Thatcher's views were denounced in more trenchant terms by Sir Edward
Heath, the former Conservative prime minister who took Britain into the EC
in 1973. Again without mentioning Mrs Thatcher's name, he said he had been
'absolutely disgusted by the bigoted, xenophobic, and rabid' statements made
about Germany.
Sir Edward described the treaty as a 'great leap forward' but, to the
discomfort of ministers, criticised the government for not agreeing to the
social chapter and the directive on working hours.
Mr Gerald Kaufman, the shadow foreign secretary, claimed that the Maastricht
treaty embodied policies which had been advocated by Labour MPs but opposed
by the government.
He clashed with Mr Tony Benn, Labour MP for Chesterfield, who, in defiance
of the Labour leadership, announced that he would vote against the bill. Mr
Benn argued that Mr Kaufman had highlighted Labour's opposition to
government policy on the social chapter and other issues, but not to the
bill itself.
He told the shadow foreign secretary: 'All the logic of your argument is to
invite Labour MPs to vote for the bill.'
Summing up, Mr Norman Lamont, chancellor of the exchequer, said the
government did not believe that a single monetary policy required the
central determination of countries' levels of taxes and spending.
What was sought was a balance between what was responsible and the freedom
of countries to determine their own policies in these areas. 'We totally
reject the harmonisation of direct taxes,' he said.
For Labour, Mr John Smith, the shadow chancellor and a contender for the
party leadership, argued that the convergence criteria were 'too narrowly
formulated' and should be expanded to take account employment and economic
growth.
It was important for governments to 'recapture' the influence they ought to
have over economic and financial policy. In a world where corporations were
increasingly operating internationally, governments 'must do likewise'.
The 22 Conservative MPs who voted against the government last night were: Mr
Rupert Allason (Torbay); Mr John Biffen (Shropshire North); Sir Richard Body
(Holland with Boston); Mr Nicholas Budgen (Wolverhampton South West); Mr
John Butcher (Coventry South West); Mr John Carlisle (Luton North); Mr
Michael Carttiss (Great Yarmouth); Mr Bill Cash (Stafford); Mr James Cran
(Beverley); Mr Christopher Gill (Ludlow); Ms Teresa Gorman (Billericay); Mr
Harry Greenway (Ealing North); Mr Andrew Hunter (Basingstoke); Mr Toby
Jessel (Twickenham); Mr Tony Marlow (Northampton North); Mr David Porter
(Waveney); Mr Richard Shepherd (Aldridge-Brownhills); Sir Trevor Skeet
(Bedfordshire North); Mr Michael Spicer (Worcestershire South); Sir Teddy
Taylor (Southend East); Mrs Ann Winterton (Congleton) and Mr Nicholas
Winterton (Macclesfield)

FT  22 MAY 92 / Parliament and Politics: Pensions review expected soon
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLANS for the promised review of pension law and regulation would be
announced very soon after the Commons reassembles from the spring recess
early next month, Mr John Major, the prime minister, said yesterday.
Both Mr Major and Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, came under
pressure from Tory and Labour MPs for an early statement or debate on the
plight of the Maxwell pensioners.
Mr Major said he thought everyone would sympathise with the Maxwell
pensioners, 'but until it is a little clearer what precisely went wrong, we
cannot sensibly say what should be done to put it right'.
The prospect of a pensioners' lobby of MPs on June 8 led MPs to urge that
the government should make clear its position a few days in advance.
However Mr Newton said merely that Mr Peter Lilley, the social security
secretary, would want to respond as soon as possible to the report from the
social security committee and announce the terms of reference for the
review.
The cross-party group of MPs campaigning on behalf of the Maxwell pensioners
is planning to meet in the week before the pensioners' lobby.
But consensus about the need to help the pensioners broke down when Mr David
Shaw, Tory MP for Dover, claimed that Labour had not wanted a debate on the
Maxwell affair before the election.
Mr John Cunningham, the shadow leader of the Commons, rebuked Mr Shaw for
making 'typically inaccurate, indeed reckless, comments'.

attrition - Alison Smith gauges the mettle of Westminster's Euro-rebels
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNDETERRED by their failure to stop the bill last night, the cross-party
bands of Euro-rebels will be fighting on - and fighting to win - as the
legislation proceeds through Westminster.
Once it became clear that Labour would try to block the bill only and
specifically on the grounds of opposing the UK's opting out of the social
chapter and economic and monetary union - a course which would not attract
any Tory rebels - the Euro-sceptics knew they would not be able to stop it
in its tracks.
At last week's Tory Euro-sceptics' dinner at the Carlton Club - even before
the numbers of rebels had hardened - the talk was of tactics during the
bill's committee stage, when MPs as a whole will be able to discuss it in
detail and propose amendments to it.
The critical question for the rebels will be whether they can devise an
amendment which could unite elements as disparate as the Labour frontbench
and hardened Euro-sceptics such as Sir Teddy Taylor on the Tory side.
In any event, there is certain to be an attempt to propose a referendum, and
though this might lead the pro-European Liberal Democrats to vote with some
Tory Euro-sceptics, it may be difficult for the Labour party to agree.
The two options open to the rebels for handling the bill are co-operation or
delay. With co-operation, perhaps four full days would be set aside for
discussion of the main issues. There are votes, which they are likely to
lose, but at least the arguments would have been given a hearing.
But if the rebels - or even a small minority of them - decide to filibuster
in a bid to delay the bill, then the government might seek to impose a
timetable on discussion, perhaps by then with popular support from
backbenchers on both sides of the Commons.
Alternatively, it could simply threaten a later summer recess.
Though either route ends in the passage of the bill, both parties have been
making strenuous efforts to minimise the rebellion.
Particular pressure has been applied to new MPs, with more success on the
Tory side than on the opposition.
Mr Llew Smith, the Labour MP for Blaenau Gwent, used his maiden speech to
explain why he was going to vote against the bill instead of following the
party line of abstaining. Mr Nick Harvey, the new Liberal Democrat MP for
Devon North, abstained rather than following his colleagues in voting for
the bill.
More generally, reminders that none of the rebels seemed to have mentioned
to the electorate just a few weeks ago that they were planning to vote
against party policy have been coming from the two frontbenches. There have
also been touching appeals to logic, party unity and detailed argument when
in many cases the view held is more instinctive and high-flown.
On both sides, the rebels include a few figures, such as Mr John Biffen and
Mr Peter Shore, whose seniority even those wholly unsympathetic to their
stance say gives the rebellion 'a bit of class'.
'I don't feel as though I'm backing a loser,' said one senior rebel, 'but
I'm not sure we'll win in my lifetime.'

FT  22 MAY 92 / Royal visit to a British corner of Spain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER BRUCE

<DATELINE>
   SEVILLE
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
IF EVER there was a good time to be British in Spain, it was yesterday in
Seville - when the Prince and Princess of Wales arrived to celebrate British
Day at Expo '92.
Pipe bands and the band of the Royal Marines marched in front of a huge
glass waterfall. The Royal couple walked around a yacht built by British
Steel and waved to the crowd. The Red Arrows zoomed overhead but were
invisible because the walkways have over-hanging shrubs to keep out the sun.
Inside Britain's pavilion, which is British territory for the summer,
visitors are greeted by Elizabeth, who says: 'I'll be your navigator today.'
The Expo theme is Discovery.
In front of a bank of about 400 screens filled with images of Britain,
Elizabeth said she was going to take the visitors on a journey 'to a country
you think you may know well'.
But first, some questions. Did we think the British were unemotional? Did we
think they loved tradition more than technology (this as the pipe band
struck up again outside)? Did the British value dignity more than dynamism?
In a theatre high in the steel tube and glass pavilion, an actor did an
elaborate and impressive mime to sound and lights.
In the often-used US portable pavilion things were hopeless. The hamburgers
were cold and there were no hot dogs.
One of the pavilions belongs to Cruzcampo, a local brewery owned by
Guinness. The royals never made it to Cruzcampo, but the managers were
hoping the Red Arrows might drop in for a pint. Unfortunately they were last
seen heading south, maybe back to Gibraltar, another bit of territory owned
by Britain.

FT  22 MAY 92 / 400 Names face average Pounds 80,000 loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ABOUT 400 Lloyd's Names will learn this week that they must pay an average
of more than Pounds 80,000 each to meet losses sustained since 1983 by
syndicate 387, which specialised in offering stop-loss reinsurance policies
to other Names.
Syndicate 387's losses for 1989 alone amount to Pounds 32.93m - more than
five times the size of its stamp or capital base, and one of the worst
results produced by any of the 401 syndicates trading at the Lloyd's
insurance market in 1989. Lloyd's is expected next month to report a loss of
between Pounds 1.6bn and Pounds 1.8bn for 1989, according to the latest
estimates.
The affairs of more than 70 per cent of the syndicate's Names were handled
by agencies linked to the Lime Street agency. Names will be asked to meet
the losses by mid July.
The syndicate was formerly managed by the Gooda Walker agency, which went
into liquidation last October. Many of the Names - individuals whose assets
back underwriting - already face severe underwriting losses as a result of
their membership of syndicates managed by Gooda Walker, Rose Thomson Young
and other agencies which underwrote spiral reinsurance business, in which
syndicates and London market companies reinsure each others' exposure to
catastrophe loss.
Syndicate 387's present managers, GW Run Off, have called in cash to meet
losses on five separate underwriting years, 1983, 1984, 1985, 1988 and 1989.
All have been left open because of uncertainty about future claims. Losses
for the five years amount to Pounds 54.93m.
Mr Ralph Sharp of GW Run Off said that the deterioration on the earlier
years was because of increasing losses from pollution and asbestos-related
claims, many of which emerge many years later. The losses for 1989 could
eventually amount to more than Pounds 43m, according to Mr Sharp.
In the years from 1983 to 1989 the syndicate's membership ranged from 239 to
448, but many were members in more than one year. In 1989 a handful of Names
committed between Pounds 30,000 and Pounds 40,000, and face losses of up to
Pounds 300,000 each.
An early-day motion concerning alleged malpractice by professionals at
Lloyd's was withdrawn from the Commons order paper yesterday. The motion had
been tabled by two Tory MPs - Mr Paul Marland, MP for Gloucestershire West,
and Mr Henry Bellingham, MP for Norfolk North West.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Freight may use fast Channel link
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MacGREGOR, trans-port secretary, yesterday raised the possibility of
head-on competition between railway companies for freight traffic through
the Channel tunnel.
Mr MacGregor announced in a written Commons answer that the planned Pounds
4bn high-speed link between London and the tunnel would be designed to carry
freight as well as passenger trains.
It had been expected that the link would carry only high-speed passenger
trains while all tunnel freight traffic used BR's existing tracks to the
Kent coast.
The effect of yesterday's announcement is that operators of freight trains
will have a choice between two routes to the tunnel: the existing lines
owned by BR (or a privatised version of it) and the new line which the
government has said will be built and owned by an independent private
developer.
The transport department said yesterday that it was not strictly necessary
for the high-speed link to carry freight trains because there was enough
capacity on the existing network for all anticipated freight traffic.
This meant that two freight tracks would not be added to the two passenger
tracks because the extra Pounds 2bn cost could not be justified.
But the department could not rule out the possibility that demand might be
greater than forecast, for example, if a second Channel tunnel were built.
It has therefore decided on the relatively low-cost option of incorporating
passing loops into the railway so that high-speed passenger trains can
overtake slower freight trains.
It is not yet clear, however, whether a private-sector developer will be
found to build the line or when it will open.

FT  22 MAY 92 / PowerGen and Trafalgar plan rail terminal
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
POWERGEN, the electricity generator, and the Business Parks subsidiary of
Trafalgar House, the shipping, construction and property group, emerged
yesterday as potential sponsors of an independent railfreight terminal after
British Rail has been privatised.
The two companies plan to develop a business and distribution centre based
on a railfreight terminal at Hams Hall near Coleshill, north-east of
Birmingham.
Hams Hall is one of two sites in the west Midlands considered suitable by
Railfreight Distribution, BR's international freight arm, as Channel tunnel
terminals. The other, promoted by the Black Country Development Corporation,
is at Bescot in Walsall.
PowerGen said it was assuming Railfreight Distribution would choose Hams
Hall, 'but if it does not we will seek an independent operator for the
terminal'. Development of the terminal would take place regardless.
Railfreight Distribution expects to choose a site at the end of next month.
But the future of Railfreight Distribution is unclear. Under plans to
privatise BR, Railfreight Distribution would be sold off. Whether it would
be sold as a single entity or in blocks has yet to be decided.
The transport department says the government wants to see a number of
freight operators on the rail network.
The Hams Hall terminal would be capable of handling 1m tonnes of freight a
year by 1995, according to PowerGen and Trafalgar House. It would occupy 50
acres of a 890-acre redundant site owned by PowerGen. The two companies plan
to develop 350 acres of the site.
Hams Hall would be the largest commercial property project in the Midlands
and would create what the companies called a 'Pounds 380m facility'
providing 7,000 jobs.
The rail terminal would have private sidings and 5.5m sq ft of warehousing
and manufacturing space. The site is beside the Birmingham-Nuneaton railway
line and the Birmingham-Derby line runs across part of it. Hams Hall is next
to the M42 motorway and close to the M42-M6 junction.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Paying price of peace dividend: David White on the battle
for survival at two naval dockyards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID WHITE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITAIN'S two main naval dockyards are fighting a highly politicised battle
for survival. The private-sector companies which have been running the yards
since 1987 believe their fate will be sealed within the next year.
When the two refit yards - Devonport Royal Dockyard at Plymouth and Rosyth
Royal Dockyard in Fife - were placed under private-sector management in
1987, the change was hotly contested by unions.
Both yards have been through heavy redundancy programmes paid for by the
government. At Devonport, with an annual turnover of about Pounds 270m, jobs
have fallen from more than 11,000 to just over 5,000. Rosyth, with a Pounds
180m turnover, has cut the number of jobs from about 6,000 to 4,200.
The Ministry of Defence, which still owns the facilities, guaranteed the
managers a 'core programme' for refitting surface ships and submarines -
about two thirds of naval work with the rest being put out to competition or
carried out by the Royal Navy's maintenance yard at Portsmouth. The
programme has now been substantially reduced. Fleet numbers are being cut,
some vessels have been paid off early, and the latest ships need less
frequent work.
Devonport Management (DML), a consortium in which the main partners are
Brown and Root of the US, Balfour Beatty (part of BICC) and Weir Group, says
its warship refit work has been cut by 45 per cent compared with the
original programme.
Mr Mike Leece, managing director, thinks the whole naval industry -
shipbuilding and refit - will provide no more than 11,000 to 12,000 jobs in
the late 1990s compared with 30,000 in the mid 1980s.
The crucial decision under consideration at the MoD is on new refuelling and
refitting facilities for nuclear-powered submarines. Refitting of the UK's
Polaris ballistic-missile submarines is done at Rosyth and work on
nuclear-propelled 'hunter-killer' submarines is split between Rosyth and
Devonport. Both DML and Babcock Thorn, the management consortium at Rosyth,
believe the logical option is to concentrate this work in a single site.
Cranes and lorries are already busy at the Rosyth yard on a facility known
as RD57 to accommodate Trident submarines, the successors to Polaris.
Plans include two dry docks and an integrated refuelling site. About Pounds
50m has already been spent, and the overall cost was originally put at
Pounds 450m. DML says it could provide similar facilities for less than
Pounds 200m and that the extra work would greatly increase its efficiency.
Babcock Thorn is discussing a low-cost alternative to its original plan at
Rosyth which it says would reduce the further spending needed there to
Pounds 150m.
Both yards have diversified into areas such as refurbishing rail stock and
boat building, but both see their future pinned to submarine business.
The MoD is due to tell them by October 5 whether it proposes to renew their
contracts, which expire in April 1994.
Both dockyards are next to naval bases - another area under review at the
MoD. DML argues that the Navy, needing to find substantial savings in
support costs, cannot sustain three bases in the south - Plymouth,
Portsmouth and the smaller establishment at Portland - and that the whole
complex could be at risk, affecting 10,000 jobs.
Mr Leece says: 'At the end of the day one of us is going to pay the bloody
peace dividend.'
SIGNIFICANT delays and cost overruns in the refitting of naval vessels at
the Devonport and Rosyth dockyards have been highlighted by the National
Audit Office, the public spending watchdog.
In a report published yesterday the audit office underlined the problems of
high overhead costs and excess capacity at the yards and said the defence
ministry must determine how much of the facilities it would need in the long
term. The report recognises that commercial managers had improved efficiency
but said there was no way of assessing the net savings achieved since the
MoD handed over the running of the yards.
The audit office calculates that under-utilised staff and facilities at the
yards cost Pounds 53m in 1990-91.
Ministry of Defence: Operation of the Royal Dockyards under Commercial
Management. HMSO. Pounds 7.80.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Staple defends staff and his predecessor's record
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and JOHN MASON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN SPITE OF criticism of the Serious Fraud Office over the collapse of the
second Guinness trial and its handling of the Blue Arrow prosecution, the
new director appears relaxed about the SFO's ability to do the job.
At a press conference yesterday following publication of the SFO annual
report Mr George Staple mounted a staunch defence of the competence of his
staff and the record of his predecessor, Mrs Barbara Mills QC, now the
director of public prosecutions.
Before the Roskill fraud trials committee report, prosecution of serious
fraud was a problem. The SFO had changed that, Mr Staple said. The SFO's
conviction rate rose last year from 63 per cent to 66 per cent. The office
prosecuted 58 people in 28 trials. Twenty defendants were jailed.
Nevertheless, he admits to the strains on his department of coping with the
burgeoning of cases of detected fraud. The increased value of the cases
being reported has led to the raising of the SFO's limit for taking on new
cases from Pounds 2m to Pounds 5m.
This is in spite of a big increase in the SFO's budget, which rose from
Pounds 13.2m in 1990-91 to Pounds 17.8m last year and Pounds 21.2m this
year. Much of this increase was a result of having to mount the BCCI and
Maxwell inquiries.
'If we had the funds no doubt we could prosecute more cases - there is a lot
of serious fraud about,' Mr Staple said. 'But that is up to the government.
I feel we are doing enough to be a real deterrent.'
Confronted with the debate on how regulators and the legal profession should
best tackle the problems of combating white-collar crime, Mr Staple believes
that because the SFO is less than four years old it is not the time for
fundamental change.
He rejects an enhanced regulatory role for the office giving it powers
similar to the Securities and Exchange Commission in the US. The existing
demarcations between the SFO, Department of Trade and Industry and the Stock
Exchange work well at the moment and should not be tampered with, he said.
There are changes to trial procedures which he would like to see to counter
some of the criticism of the length of recent cases. The defence should be
forced to disclose its hand at a much earlier stage. That would allow the
prosecution to refine its case thereby reducing the overall length of the
trial. He denied that this would amount to a further erosion of a suspect's
right to silence.
A procedure for agreeing non-contentious evidence in advance of the trial
would also save time, he said. But he rejected the suggestion that the SFO
itself could make the greatest contribution to cutting the length of cases
if it abandoned its approach of throwing the book at defendants and
concentrated on the best six or 10 counts.
'The SFO is bound by the Crown Prosecution Services' code which requires us
not to charge people on the fringes of a cases only the people at its core,'
he said. 'And, equally, we are required not to overload the indictment. But
we can't be put in a straitjacket. These cases are big and they are complex.
Justice often requires a number of defendants and a number of charges.'
Mr Staple did not reject out of hand the introduction of some form of plea
bargaining in serious fraud cases.

Under the new Charities Act, financial controls will be strengthened and the
commission believes a target of obtaining accounts from 80 per cent to 90
per cent of charities can be achieved by 1994.
The commission concluded 397 inquiries into charities last year as a result
of public complaints and its own monitoring, and irregularities were
discovered in 129 cases.

Castle Hall School in Mirfield, West Yorkshire, wanted to become selective
and change its age range from 9-13 to 11-18.
It is understood that Mr Patten rejected Castle Hill's application because
it had no record of teaching the planned age range, there was no proper
financial scheme and no clear curriculum planning.
The decision was greeted with fury at the school where 91 per cent of
parents voted in favour of the application. It was reported last night that
Mr Patten may face a legal challenge from parents over his decision.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Barbara Mills QC, the director of public prosecutions, has replied to
critics over her decision not to prosecute West Midlands Serious Crime Squad
officers.
In letters in today's issues of the Independent and The Guardian newspapers,
she acknowledges the public disquiet about criminal justice but defends her
decision that there was insufficient evidence for officers to be prosecuted.
In the Independent she says: 'There is an enormous difference between poor
supervision and sloppy management practice, and criminality. This point
appears not to have been appreciated in much of the reporting of the
matter.'
The Crown Prosecution Service could only support criminal proceedings when
there was 'sufficient, substantial, admissible and reliable evidence to
provide a realistic prospect of conviction'.
Mrs Mills' decision not to prosecute any officers of the former West
Midlands Serious Crime Squad followed an investigation by West Yorkshire
Police into allegations of corruption, fraud, perjury and faked evidence and
several successful appeals against convictions on its evidence, including
that of the Birmingham Six.

FT  22 MAY 92 / SFO probes payroll company
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Serious Fraud Office is investigating how Payroll Services, a private
payments company, allegedly diverted more than Pounds 24m of PAYE and
National Insurance payments from the Inland Revenue and may have invested in
a string of properties and a Spanish villa.
Payroll Services, based in Sutton, south London, which serves more than 500
banks and financial institutions around the capital, went into provisional
liquidation last month after the Inland Revenue discovered that one of the
companies had fallen badly behind on its tax payments.
Touche Ross, the accountancy firm acting as provisional liquidator, said the
SFO is also investigating Payroll Services's parent, the Wren Group, where
some of the money was allegedly transferred, and the directors of the
companies.
The Inland Revenue is understood to have extended an informal moratorium on
the payment of these missing taxes. But it says Payroll Services' clients -
which include a number of London offices of large Japanese and European
banks - will have to make a second tax payment if the missing funds are not
recovered.
Payroll Services is one of a number of groups that have grown rapidly in
recent years as smaller companies contract out the monthly payment of
salary, PAYE and national insurance. The company handled more than Pounds
30m of such payments each month.
According to the Touche Ross report, Wren Group appears to have invested in
55 properties, some of them residential, while Payroll Services owned a
Pounds 75,000 villa in Spain.
Mr Terence Wright, who owns all but one of Payroll Services's shares, is
among a number of directors being pursued by Touche Ross.
Among Wren Group's assets is an office building in Sutton which is nearly
fully let to a number of smaller companies on short leases.
Among the other subsidiaries of the Wren Group are a photographic company; a
distributor of hydraulic parts and equipment; a property refurbishment
company and an insurance broker.
Last month the Bank of England called for provisional liquidators to be
appointed to a financial arm of George H. Jackson, Payroll Services's
Sutton-based auditors, which had carried on 'a banking-type business',
Touche Ross said. The arm had been operating without the required Bank of
England licence.

'Tin King'. In the first session, devoted to French furniture, all the 103
lots sold for a total of Dollars 15.9m (Pounds 8.67m).
The excellent provenance, rarity, and quality of the furniture on offer led
to competitive bidding from private collectors and dealers, and total
proceeds exceeded Sotheby's high estimate.
The top price was the Dollars 1.98m paid by a private European collector for
a Louis XVI ormolu mounted mahogany commode, painted with floral designs,
and signed Joseph. It was made around 1770 and is attributed to Boullee.
It is one of the few examples of top quality painted and veneered 18th
century French furniture to have survived.
A highly ornate Louis XIV table a ecrire, decorated with Chinese scenes,
which had been estimated to sell for about Dollars 500,000, was bid up to
Dollars 1.87m. A pair of Louis XVI ormolu mounted Boulle marquetry and
Japanese lacquer commodes, signed by Levasseur, made Dollars 1.705m.
Jaime Ortiz-Patino has been appointed adviser in Europe to the Bolivian
government and is moving from a large house in Geneva to a small house in
London.
As a result he is selling some of his collection which should bring in at
least Dollars 30m.
Sotheby's jewels sale in Geneva brought SFr23m (Pounds 8.57m). A diamond
necklace, made in London around 1900, unusual in that it is still intact,
and heavy with fin de siecle opulence, sold for Pounds 380,297.
The liquidators of BCCI pulled off a rare coup at Bonhams yesterday when
they sold two sheet gold plaques over an iron core, 4 1/2 inches in
diameter, dating from around 350 BC, for Pounds 187,000, as against a Pounds
20,000 top estimate.
The plaques show a horsed warrior spearing an enemy and were made in
Bactria, near modern day Iraq. Eight smaller plaques sold for Pounds 24,200.
All were bought by a London dealer.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Murdoch gave TV soccer deal full support
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
MR RUPERT MURDOCH, chief executive of News Corporation, promised English
football's new Premier League the backing of 'the whole company' in the
battle over TV rights.
Apart from owning 50 per cent of British Sky Broadcasting - the satellite
television consortium which on Monday won rights to broadcast 300 live
Premier League matches over five years - Mr Murdoch also owns five national
newspapers.
The combined BSkyB-BBC offer was worth a total of Pounds 304m compared with
a final ITV offer of Pounds 262m. Pearson, owner of the Financial Times, has
a stake in BSkyB.
According to one of those at Monday's league meeting - Mr Rick Parry,
Premier League chief executive - those present had been guaranteed the
backing of News International, News Corp's UK subsidiary, and 'the personal
commitment of Mr Murdoch'.
Mr Michael Grade, chief executive of Channel 4, said that, if true, the
Murdoch promise was not 'the level playing field or the new spirit of
competition envisaged by the Broadcasting Act'.
Mr Greg Dyke, chairman of ITV Sport, said he had written to Sir John
Quinton, chairman of the Premier League, asking for Monday's decision to be
set aside. Mr Parry, however, said the decision was 'irrevocable.'
Yesterday, Mr Alan Sugar - chairman of Tottenham Hotspur, a Premier League
club, and of Amstrad, which sells satellite dishes - conceded he had spoken
to BSkyB on the day of the meeting but that the company had already been
informed of the new ITV offer. Mr Sugar said nothing unfair had happened on
Monday.
'There was never an official tender offer date. Mr Parry always made it
clear to both parties the latest offer status. Both companies had up to the
last minute to make their final offer and they did,' Mr Sugar said. 'ITV had
been soliciting each chairman with an envelope including their final offer
at the doors of the meeting.' At the meeting, Mr David Dein of Arsenal had
asked that Mr Sugar abstain from voting because he was a manufacturer of
satellite equipment. Mr Sugar offered to do so but the club chairmen and
chief executives present decided by 20-1 to allow him to vote.
Mr Dyke said ITV Sport felt it had been misled. 'We are told that when the
meeting started at 10am the bids were very close.
'However, by one means or another, BSkyB learned of the size of our bid and
was allowed to increase their bid.'
Mr Sam Chisholm, chief executive of BSkyB, yesterday expressed surprise that
ITV wanted the bidding re-opened.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Jump in lending suggests growing confidence
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIGNS that confidence among businesses and consumers is improving were
boosted yesterday by news that bank and building society lending roselast
month.
The Bank of England said lending by banks and building societies to the
private and corporate sectors - M4 lending - grew by Pounds 5.1bn in the
month. The sharp jump suggested an increase in building society loans for
house purchases.
Economists warned against reading too much into one month's figures, and
said much of the growth was a rebound from March, when companies and
individuals made repayments totalling Pounds 400m net. It was the first time
since 1982 that repayments on bank and building society lending outstripped
new loans.
The modestly encouraging news from the Bank was backed by figures from the
British Bankers' Association, the trade body for Britain's nine biggest
banking groups. The figures showed that lending by the association's members
to the private sector grew by Pounds 2.6bn last month, the largest rise
since the statistics began a year ago. This increase followed a net
repayment by the private sector of almost Pounds 1.75bn in March. According
to the association's figures, lending to individuals for house buying grew
by Pounds 402m compared with a rise of Pounds 197m in April last year.
The figures also showed that consumers continued to repay debt. Last month
consumers repaid a net Pounds 43m on personal loans including overdrafts,
loans for cars, and credit card loans, compared with a rise of Pounds 103m
in April last year. Within the company sector, bank lending to securities
dealers grew by Pounds 306m, to wholesalers by Pounds 200m and to
manufacturers by Pounds 196m. Those figures were offset by net repayments
from leasing, construction and property companies. 'One should never draw
conclusions from one month's figures since they may be erratic,' said Lord
Inchyra, association secretary-general. 'It is particularly difficult in a
month like this, where there is a very large seasonal adjustment, to point
to any clear signs of an upturn in the demand for credit.'
Figures for money supply growth were in line with expectations. Narrow
money, or M0, which comprises mostly notes and coins in circulation and
represents underlying demand pressures, rose 0.4 per cent last month to give
a 2.3 per cent increase for the year. M0 growth in the year to March it was
2.2 per cent. M4 rose by 0.8 per cent last month, bringing the year-on-year
growth rate to 5.7 per cent.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Company register reform is urged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL CASSELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CHAMBERS of Commerce are to press the government to support the
establishment of a mandatory trading register for all companies along the
lines already adopted by many EC countries.
Representatives of the chambers are to meet Mr Michael Heseltine, trade and
industry secretary, on June 8 to seek ministerial backing for a wide-ranging
overhaul of the system of registration.
The initiative is designed to simplify and speed up the process of company
licensing and registration and to improve the flow of commercial information
available.
Mr Richard Brown, director of policy for the Association of British Chambers
of Commerce, told the association's conference in Brighton that British
companies faced heavy burdens of compliance.
The report of an association working party on the issue presented to the
conference says there is widespread confusion and ignorance, particularly
among new businesses, about regulatory and licensing requirements.
Mr Brown said British companies had to compete with a culture which sought
to inhibit business and had to deal with regulatory bodies which sometimes
appeared set on preventing the creation of wealth.
There was, he claimed, considerable scope for streamlining the process of
obtaining registration or licences. The chambers were proposing - in place
of the existing piecemeal approvals - a network of trading formalities
centres where the registration process would be co-ordinated. The centres
would provide a 'one-stop' entry point at which all businesses could quickly
establish the necessary procedures for compliance.
Chambers say many business opportunities are lost because of the
'information gap'.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Foreign banks await securities scam fall-out
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   BOMBAY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WITH INDIA'S financial markets in disarray as a result of irregular
securities trading, foreign banks are nervous that in the fall-out from the
country's worst financial scandal they could face a further setback to their
expansion plans.
Foreign banks dominate the interbank securities market from which Mr Harshad
Mehta, the Bombay broker, and others raised large sums for stock market
speculation. These institutions face the charge that it was their more
innovative and aggressive trading practices that produced the environment in
which abuses flourished.
The two oldest foreign banks - Standard Chartered, the British-based bank,
and ANZ Grindlays, the former UK bank now Australian-owned, - are seen to
have had inadequate controls over their securities dealing. Standard
Chartered has announced provisions of Pounds 50m for losses in its
operations. Grindlays is believed to be exposed on Rs5bn to Rs6bn (Pounds
97m-Pounds 116m) of transactions, though ultimate losses could be
substantially less.
Foreign banks, which account for 6 to 7 per cent of bank deposits, had hoped
to be a big beneficiary of financial deregulation - both through setting up
new investment banks and through more branch offices.
Part of the suspicion of foreign banks stems from the different compulsions
under which they act compared with the state-owned banks. The state banks -
though this is now beginning to change - had as their primary function
allocating credit at government direction. They were not too worried about
their balance sheets. The foreign banks are increasingly profit-driven and
in search of new opportunities to improve earnings in a tightly regulated
banking system that provides little room to manoeuvre.
The local state-owned banks used the interbank market to purchase securities
in line with statutory liquidity requirements, laid down by the Reserve Bank
of India, the central bank, that they hold a proportion of their deposits -
until recently 38 per cent - with the Bank in government paper.
Foreign banks, however, actively traded in the market. They swapped
securities of differing interest rates and maturities to improve yields;
they sought to prevent the depreciation of their portfolios when interest
rates moved; and they looked to trading profits. They also introduced new
instruments into the market - such as the banker's receipt, a promissory
note issued by a bank to pledge delivery of securities. Fraudulent and
uncovered banker's receipts lie at the heart of the scandal.
Over the last 18 months nationalised banks have come under pressure to
improve their balance sheets as a first step to financial reform. Interest
rate changes became more frequent - with the beginnings of deregulation,
rates were moving more in line with inflation. Both foreign and state-owned
banks responded with increased trading.
A new generation of brokers - of whom Mr Mehta is the symbol - entered the
market pressing new techniques and cutting new deals. Mr Mehta is an
approved Reserve Bank broker in the securities market. Many were not.
A year ago the stock market took off on a boom that was to treble the value
of the Bombay Stock Exchange index. The temptation grew to syphon funds from
trade in government debt to make share purchases on the stock market.
In this hothouse atmosphere, central bank supervision was inadequate and
carelessness crept into trading. The Reserve Bank's own ledger of security
transfers - maintained by hand - fell well behind. Banks failed to verify
with each other the authenticity of banker's receipts. Smaller banks - most
prominently the Bank of Karad, which now has problems meeting its
obligations - issued receipts of a size out of proportion with their assets.
Some foreign banks are patting themselves on the back that they have got
away unscathed. 'Its a tribute to our systems and our procedures,' said one.
But in such an unruly market those who escaped had luck on their side.
Mr Manohar Jethnand Pherwani, head of the state-owned National Housing Bank,
who resigned last week when investigators discovered that Rs7bn was missing,
died yesterday of a heart attack. Once known as the 'Big Bull' of the Bombay
bourse, he was credited with developing an equities mania among Indians.

ISRAEL'S war with the pro-Iranian Lebanese Shia Moslem Hizbollah escalated
yesterday when Israeli aircraft twice bombed Hizbollah targets in Lebanon,
killing nine guerrillas and wounding 20. Unconfirmed reports said that one
of the dead was an Iranian revolutionary guard.
The bombing raids and helicopter gunship attacks on two Shia villages in
southern Lebanon constituted the most serious Israeli offensive against
Hizbollah since the violence following Israel's assassination of the group's
leader, Sheikh Abbas Musawi, in February.
A Hizbollah delegation had met Syrian Vice-President Abdel-Halim Khaddam in
Damascus on Wednesday night. Syria has supported Hizbollah's 'resistance'
operations against the Israelis. The first Israeli bombing raid yesterday
targeted a Hizbollah base at Janta, just three miles west of the Syrian
border, renewing fears that Syria could be drawn into the Hizbollah-Israeli
conflict.
The current fighting began on Tuesday, when Hizbollah militiamen overran a
hilltop position of the South Lebanon Army (SLA), Israel's proxy militia in
southern Lebanon.
Reuter adds from Jerusalem: The Israeli army said it was checking
Palestinian claims that undercover troops had shot and wounded seven
children on Wednesday, during a Palestinian election campaign in the
occupied West Bank city of Nablus.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Stand-off in Thai power struggle: The confrontation between
the people and the military is far from over
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VICTOR MALLET
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THAILAND'S political crisis is not yet over.
After three days of violent confrontations between the government and
pro-democracy demonstrators, Bangkok was returned to its normal state of
noise and congestion yesterday by the timely intervention of King Bhumipol
Adulyadej.
The compromise brokered by the king late on Wednesday between Gen Suchinda
Kraprayoon, the prime minister, and Mr Chamlong Srimuang, leader of the
opposition campaign, has halted the violence and given businesses the chance
to recover from the week's chaos.
This forced reconciliation of enemies in the presence of the monarch,
however, is only an interim solution.
It is now up to the two sides to achieve the seemingly impossible task of
satisfying both the political ambitions of the military establishment and
the democratic aspirations of the Thai people. Yesterday neither side showed
much willingness to yield.
As 3,000 protesters emerged from jail yesterday under an amnesty announced
by Gen Suchinda - some still wearing clothes stained with the blood of dead
comrades - they insisted that the prime minister would have to resign and
even go into exile. On his own admission, 40 people were killed in the
disturbances, although unofficial tallies put the death toll higher.
All over the capital, residents expressed relief that the violence had ended
but said it would take a long time to heal the emotional scars left by the
sight of Thai soldiers gunning down civilians in the city centre. 'Anger'
was the word most commonly expressed, and opposition parties are demanding
that Gen Suchinda and his government should be held accountable for the
actions of the army.
The sense of continuing conflict was underlined by a reference in one
Bangkok newspaper to missing protestors as 'pro-democracy MIAs', an
abbreviation usually reserved for soldiers missing in action.
King Bhumipol's intervention has left the ball in the government's court.
After meeting the king, Gen Suchinda promised to arrange for parliament to
meet next week to rush through an amendment of the constitution, one of the
opposition's main demands.
They want the constitution changed to reduce the power of the
military-appointed senate and reserve the premiership for an elected member
of parliament, but it is unclear how far the pro-military coalition which
appointed the unelected Gen Suchinda is prepared to go down the path of
reform.
Indeed, it was the coalition's hesitation on the constitutional issue which
contributed to the violence in the first place. The five parties in the
government, having conceded the need to change the constitution, appeared to
be backtracking just before the disturbances erupted on Sunday night. King
Bhumipol implicitly criticised Gen Suchinda on this point in his audience on
Wednesday.
Throughout this week the members of the coalition, having won the elections
in March with the help of vote-buying in the provinces, have either remained
silent or made undiplomatic statements which have grated on the ears of the
more sophisticated population of Bangkok; the capital voted overwhelmingly
for Mr Chamlong in the elections.
Gen Suchinda dismissed his opponents as communists or Buddhist heretics. Mr
Samak Sundaravej, deputy premier, responded to a question about the killing
of anti-government protestors by saying: 'Let me ask you something. Why
didn't anybody blame President George Bush when he sent troops to invade
other countries?' And Mr Arthit Urairat, speaker of the lower house of
parliament, drew an angry reaction from doctors and patients at a Bangkok
hospital when he and other coalition MPs visited injured protesters and
handed them tins of evaporated milk.
Nor is it clear if Gen Suchinda is prepared to resign or if the coalition
would then choose somebody acceptable to replace him.
After the loss of so many lives, the demonstrators are determined to win at
least a modest victory. They have warned that the protests will resume if
their demands are not met by parliament, but government MPs apparently do
not share the same sense of urgency. It was announced yesterday that
although parliament would meet on Monday it would not consider
constitutional amendments until Friday.
'I think it's going to be very jittery over the next few days,' said one
western diplomat in Bangkok.
Even if a compromise on the constitution can be reached, there is no sign of
a solution to the much deeper problem of the military's long-standing
involvement in politics and business.
The generals have seen their freedom of action constrained in recent years
by the growing confidence of civilian politicians. Thailand, however, did
not resolve the issue of military interference when the king intervened to
change the government after riots in 1973, and neither he nor anybody else
is likely to do so now.

FT  22 MAY 92 / French missile bid stirs row: George Graham on US anger at
Thomson-CSF's move to buy missiles division of US defence contractor
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GEORGE GRAHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THOMSON-CSF, the French state-controlled defence electronics group, has
provoked a storm in Washington over its efforts to buy the missiles division
of LTV, the US steel and industrial group operating under bankruptcy
protection.
The Committee on Foreign Investment in the US (CFIUS), a review body chaired
by the Treasury, this week decided to launch a full investigation of the
deal under the Exon-Florio rules, introduced in 1988 to give the president
the power to block or reverse any foreign acquisition that 'threatens to
impair the national security'.
But, even before the formal CFIUS review has begun, Thomson-CSF has come
under fire from Congress. The French group's representatives have been
grilled by a series of hostile Congressional investigative committees. Two
of the Senate's most senior members, Senator Robert Byrd of West Virginia
and Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas, have sponsored a bill to ban the deal.
The Bush administration's decision on LTV's missile business - which is
involved in top-secret US military programmes, such as the Losat anti-tank
missile and the MLRS anti-artillery missile system - could foreshadow US
policy on an expected wave of foreign acquisitions in sensitive technology
areas.
As military purchasing budgets shrink, the US defence industry is
restructuring. Some industry executives estimate that 100 subsidiaries,
divisions or units of defence contractors are up for sale. Many of these are
likely to interest foreign buyers.
'The LTV case offers the president an opportunity to demonstrate that, in
fact, he has a strategy for America's defence industrial base in the
post-Cold War era,' said Senator James Exon, co-author of the Exon-Florio
rules.
LTV at first agreed in February to sell its missile and aircraft business as
a whole for Dollars 355m to a consortium formed by Lockheed and Martin
Marietta, two leading US defence contractors.
In April Thomson-CSF bid Dollars 280m for the missiles division, coupled
with a Dollars 120m bid for the aircraft division from Carlyle Group, a
Washington-based merchant bank headed by Mr Frank Carlucci, the former
defence secretary.
After a round of bidding, the New York bankruptcy judge presiding over LTV
awarded the two units to Thomson-CSF and Carlyle for a total of Dollars
450m.
Opposition to the Thomson-CSF-LTV deal focuses on three points of concern:
The security of secret US military technologies. Thomson-CSF's state
ownership, which its competitors fear could give it unfair subsidies, cheap
capital and political advantages.
Hostility to France, which has been described by senators as 'aggressive',
'stubborn' and 'cocksure', and accused of widespread industrial espionage
against the US.
Thomson-CSF has already begun discussions with the defence department about
measures to protect US secrets. These include a 'special security
arrangement' by which classified information would be placed under the
control of a special committee of US citizens with the necessary security
clearances.
Pentagon officials appear, however, to be happy with this kind of
arrangement only up to the 'Secret' level of classification. In past foreign
acquisitions involving 'Top Secret' or 'Comsec' classifications, the
Pentagon has insisted that control of the company be placed in the hands of
a voting trust or of proxies.
'It has to become a passive ownership or it doesn't fly,' said Mr Donald
Atwood, deputy secretary of defence, last month.
Mr Daniel Tellep, chairman and chief executive of Lockheed, argues that even
proxies or voting trusts are inadequate protection, since it is at the level
of a company's engineers that technology is transferred.
Mr Carlucci retorts that Thomson-CSF engineers already have access to their
US pany's participation in US programmes, such as the US Army's MSE
battlefield communications system based on Thomson-CSF's Rita system.
'Thomson-CSF already bids on defence department contracts. It has at least
20 classified contracts now. The only question is whether it should bid
offshore or onshore,' he says.
On the issue of government ownership, Thomson-CSF has an even harder task
defending itself.
'What we have here is a policy problem involving government involvement in
the free enterprise system, and the two are like oil and water,' said Mr
Norman Augustine, chairman and chief executive of Martin Marietta.
More troubling, however, is the extent of anti-French sentiment displayed in
the tussle over the LTV deal.
Senator Fritz Hollings of South Carolina is perhaps the most overtly
xenophobic member of the Senate, but his gibes are usually directed at the
Japanese and the Koreans.
Of the French, he said: 'We love each other. I've stood on tables all over
France singing the Marseillaise.'
But in a barbed exchange with Mr Carlucci, he placed France alongside Iraq
in his pandemonium.
'I couldn't possibly see General (Norman) Schwarzkopf being employed by
Saddam Hussein to train his troops. Why should we allow you to come in now
as a former Secretary of Defence and take over our defence technology for
France?' he said.
The old days of ever-expanding military budgets are over, however. Today's
procurement budgets may not sustain even a single domestic supplier in many
areas of defence technology, let alone competing suppliers. The alternative
to foreign acquisition may, for many US defence companies, be shutdown.

</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR members of the Bush administration yesterday angrily rejected
Congressional charges that the White House was trying to cover up
improprieties related to more than Dollars 4bn of loans to Iraq by Italy's
Banca Nazionale del Lavoro.
In testimony before the House of Representatives banking committee, Mr
Lawrence Eagleburger, deputy secretary of state, attacked the committee's
release of classified documents which, he claimed, had led to 'distortions
of the record, half-truths, and outright falsehoods, all combined into
spurious conspiracy theories and charges of a cover-up.'
He was referring to a series of Bush administration documents made public by
Mr Henry Gonzalez, committee chairman, who has argued that the documents
show a pattern of administration financial assistance to Iraq and possible
knowledge of the secret BNL loans, made from the bank's branch at Atlanta,
Georgia.
Mr Gonzalez criticised President George Bush for failure to provide Congress
with a series of BNL-related documents.
In reply, Mr Eagleburger said the administration would not permit the
further release of documents without fresh assurances that they would be
kept confidential by Congress.
Mr Eagleburger and Mr John Robson, deputy treasury secretary, testified that
there had been insufficient evidence of any Iraqi wrongdoing in the BNL
affair, in November 1989, for a senior White House meeting to block the
extension of Dollars 1bn of separate, government-guaranteed loans to
Baghdad.
Mr Eagleburger stated that these US government-guaranteed loans for Iraqi
purchase of US agricultural goods were seen by the Reagan and Bush
administrations as a tool to moderate Iraq's President Saddam Hussein. 'It
didn't work,' admitted Mr Eagleburger.
Mr Edward Kelley, a member of the Federal Reserve's board of governors, made
clear that, at the White House meeting, the Fed had firmly opposed more US
export credit loan guarantees for Iraq because of concern about the BNL case
and Iraq's credit-worthiness.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: German minister stands his ground
against farm lobby
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
GERMANY'S battle-hardened agriculture minister, Mr Ignaz Kiechle, must have
known he was on a hiding to nothing.
On Tuesday, the German farmers' union demanded that he fight the proposed
reforms 'with all his might, and even use his veto if necessary'. So it was
hardly a surprise that Baron Constantin von Heereman, president of the
German farmers' organisation, the Deutscher Bauernverband (DBV) for the past
23 years, denounced the package yesterday as 'intolerable'.
'We are in favour of reform, but not the one which Kiechle is accepting,' he
declared. 'They get a 5 per cent plus wage rise in the public sector, and we
get 35 per cent minus for the cereal farmers: it is unacceptable.' That
comes on top of a drop in farm incomes in 1990-91 of 16 per cent, and little
better than stagnation in the current year, according to official figures.
The DBV predicts another real loss of some 21 per cent in 1991-92.
For once, however, Mr Kiechle seemed to be standing his ground against his
own farming lobby, strongest above all in his native Bavaria. He described
the DBV and its members as 'day-dreamers who have no idea of agricultural
political necessities'.
Mr Kiechle fought his corner in Brussels with his usual tenacity, but the
key change in Germany's position was that he did not appear willing to use
his veto. Two factors seem to be behind that relaxation in Germany's staunch
defence of the CAP: a desire to reach a deal in the Gatt round, above all
before the Group of Seven world economic summit in Munich in July, to be
chaired by Chancellor Helmut Kohl; and the advent of huge east German farms
to German agriculture, requiring a whole new set of policy priorities.
German agriculture is no longer so dominated by small farmers - above all by
part-time farmers. A whole new category of huge factory farms on the eastern
model have now to be taken into consideration. Most are effectively bankrupt
now, but they have to be given the incentive to recover.
Mr Kiechle wanted a cereal price cut of 15-20 per cent maximum. In that, he
was seeking to defend western Germany's relatively small and high-cost
farmers, fearful that if the EC support price were dropped too far, they
would be unable to compete with French cereal farmers, themselves driven out
of the export market.
He has been forced to accept a 29 per cent cut, although he will be allowed
to pay substantial compensation to his farmers. Germany was happy to go
along with Britain in calling for the compensation to be paid to big farms
as well as small - thanks to the existence of the eastern farms.
The compensation comes in two ways: Mr Kiechle has won the right to keep
paying income support measures this year to replace the 3 per cent VAT
rebate which expired last year. That is a German national measure - a clear
distortion of the agricultural common market, and therefore an important
concession.
The second form of compensation is that payable to all EC farmers in
exchange for a 15 per cent reduction in their arable land. Mr Kiechle was
determined that the payments should be allowed for an indefinite period. But
even then, his farmers are suspicious.
'The farmers are naturally sceptical about whether the compensation will be
lasting,' an Agriculture Ministry official said yesterday. 'Lasting could
mean five years, or it could mean 10 years.' Or as one diplomatic observer
of German agriculture put it: 'The farmers know they are being paid to do
nothing. That is a very vulnerable position to be in.'
The EC reforms bring German agriculture face to face with some unpleasant
realities.
'They have to restructure their agriculture and lower their overheads,' an
independent analyst said. 'That means they are going to have to go further
down the road towards the industrialisation of agriculture - which is
anathema to Mr Kiechle.'
The irony is that perhaps Mr Kiechle will not be around to implement it. He
is widely expected to be a casualty of the next cabinet reshuffle in the
autumn, finally abandoned by his friend and admirer, Chancellor Kohl, in the
interests, no doubt of 'agricultural, political necessities'.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: Wary US takes longview of outlook for
grain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NANCY DUNNE and BARBARA DURR
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON, CHICAGO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FOR THE past decade, US officials have cajoled, threatened and spent
billions on agriculture export subsidies in an effort to convince the
European Community to phase out farm supports. When the news arrived
yesterday in Washington of a deal to begin reform of the Common Agriculture
Policy, the reaction was subdued.
The immediate response to the agreement was 'mass confusion, maybe long-term
hope and maybe long-term heartburn', said Mr Paul Drazek, a spokesman for
the American Farm Bureau.
He thought CAP reform 'could be the most significant development in the
grain trade in the last 30 years,' but he cautioned that its importance
'would depend on how much less production and dumping' there was likely to
be.
Grain market experts also expressed some scepticism about how a CAP
subsidies cut of 29 per cent, instead of the 35 per cent proposed by the
European Commission, would be received by Washington in this electoral year.
Many farm lobbyists who advise Mrs Carla Hills, US trade representative, say
they will not support any Uruguay Round deal which weakens proposals by Mr
Arthur Dunkel, Gatt director-general for deeper subsidy cuts.
There is already so much uncertainty in the grain markets because of the
changes in eastern Europe that the impact of CAP reform - stretched out over
years - is likely to be less important than a drought in Mongolia or snow in
Brazil.
In Chicago, there was reluctance to predict any price effects on grains. CAP
reform was 'certainly encouraging,' said Mr Martyn Foreman, an analyst with
Agrivisor, a market advisory service of the Illinois Farm Bureau. 'It would
put some underpinning in world prices.'
Past US Department of Agriculture studies have forecast a rise in grain
prices in the event of a 35 per cent cut in European subsidies, but Mr
Daniel Basse, director of market research at AgResource in Chicago, said the
USDA was assuming demand would remain constant, a premise that not all
analysts share.
Even without CAP reform, the outlook for commodity prices is murky, experts
believe. Much depends on countries like China and the Commonwealth of
Independent States. This year, the CIS wheat crop looks to be 12m tonnes
larger than last year's 73m tonnes. China is both the largest wheat producer
and importer (94m tonnes and 16m tonnes, respectively, are predicted) but it
can easily curb imports, as it has in the past for political reasons.
According to Mr Basse, the effects of lower EC prices would not be felt at
the earliest until next year's crops. Eventually, reductions in EC grain
production and less dumping of excess grains on world markets could help
raise exports, particularly of wheat, from other grain producers.
Countries such as Canada, Australia and Argentina were considered more
likely to see the benefits on exports than the US given that Washington has
competed with Europe on export subsidies while other countries have not.
Mr John Sault, agricultural counsellor of the Australian embassy in
Washington, said his country had been caught in the crossfire between the EC
and the US export subsidies, pushing Australian traders out of their
traditional markets such as the former Soviet Union and China. CAP reform
gave some hope that former markets could be regained.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Farm Reform in Europe: Britain welcomes levelling of field
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH FARMERS yesterday welcomed the end of the uncertainty surrounding
their businesses.
Their main complaint about the original plans to reform the CAP was that
they discriminated against the UK, which has much larger and more efficient
farms than the rest of Europe.
Much of the original discrimination against British agriculture appears to
have been cleared away. In particular, farmers with large acreages will be
relieved at the demise of a proposal to limit the amount of set-aside land
on which compensation is paid. This was the biggest stumbling block for the
UK during the negotiations.
'It would appear that John Gummer has achieved quite a remarkable victory on
behalf of all UK arable farmers,' the managing director of one large company
said yesterday, delighted that Britain had not been left at a disadvantage
to smaller European competitors.
Under the reform proposals 15 per cent of the arable land will be put into
set-aside. Farmers will then qualify for compensation for the 29 per cent
cut in EC cereal prices. This would imply a compensation figure of about
Pounds 200 per hectare. The Ministry of Agriculture said that Pounds 230 a
hectare had originally been proposed for a 35 per cent cut in cereal prices,
and a later proposal to cut prices by only 27 per cent would have given
Pounds 175 a hectare compensation.
Britain has gained further concessions within the reform package,
particularly for sheep farmers in the so-called 'less favoured areas', or
uplands, where the original proposals limited the number of ewes eligible
for subsidy to 750.
UK farm incomes, however, will continue to fall from already low levels.
Booker Farming, which farms and advises on 45,000 acres in England,
predicted earlier this year that the income of a top quality 500-acre farm
in the UK would fall from Pounds 20,000 to only Pounds 3,500 under the
original MacSharry proposals. While the impact of the latest package will
not be so severe, it could still cut the farm income in half.
Mr David Naish, president of the National Farmers Union, agreed yesterday
that many farms were already under severe financial pressure, but he was
prepared to accept lower prices if the UK was on an equal footing with the
rest of Europe. As long as the reform package treated all farmers the same,
'we have got to learn to live with it,' he said.

GREECE'S Public Power Corporation (PPC) has awarded a Dr19.6bn (Pounds 56m)
contract to Babcock Energy Systems, the British engineering company, to
upgrade a power station at Lavrion, near Athens, writes Kerin Hope in
Athens.
The PPC intends to help reduce atmospheric pollution in Athens by developing
generating capacity outside the city and converting diesel-fired units to
natural gas during the 1990s.
The project involves transferring a steam turbine from the Keratsini power
station in Athens to Lavrion, 40 miles from the capital, which will steam
link to two existing gas turbines to form a combined cycle unit, raising the
plant's capacity from 114 to 180 MW.

TOTAL, the French oil group, has signed a production-sharing agreement with
Komineft, the Russian oil company, for the Khariaga field.
The deal will involve investment of Dollars 400m (Pounds 218m) over two and
a half years to bring the field on stream, with total investment likely to
be Dollars 1bn over the life of the field.
Total will be the operator in the development of several geological layers
of the Khariaga oilfield, located in the Timan Pechora basin, west of the
Urals near the Arctic circle. Reserves are estimated at approximately 250m
barrels, with production likely to be around 35,000 barrels a day.
An agreement was signed in the presence of the governor of the Nenets
territory, where the Khariaga field is situated, but is subject to Russian
Federation government approval.
Total has signed two previous deals with Russian partners to bring western
oil drilling technology to boost yields from fields not yet producing.

A GROUP of visiting British executives yesterday called on the Japanese
government to ensure that foreign companies have the same access in the
country as Japanese companies have in the UK market.
The six-company group - headed by the Duke of Kent and Mr Michael Perry, the
chairman of Unilever, and including executives from Glaxo Holdings and SG
Warburg &amp; Co - presented a list of proposals to Japanese industry
representatives and the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti).
In an 'Agenda for Action by Japanese Business', the executives expressed
confidence that British companies will expand Japanese market share 'unless
that market is distorted for political reasons or because of excessive bias
towards Japanese domestic suppliers.'
However, Mr Perry said the delegation, in Tokyo as part of the Priority
Japan campaign, does not regard Japan as a 'problem' but as an
'opportunity'. He added that UK industry does not 'want to argue about the
rules of the game'.
UK exports to Japan fell from Pounds 2.63bn in 1990 to Pounds 2.26bn last
year.

FT  22 MAY 92 / World Trade News: Slovenia looks to Community for new
markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE war in the former republics of Yugoslavia is forcing Slovene enterprises
to find alternative trading partners among European Community countries as a
means of compensating for lost markets in the region.
However, Slovene officials warn that capital inflows will not increase
unless Slovenia re-establishes trade links with its southern neighbours.
Until 1990, over 30 per cent of Slovenia's exports were with the former
Yugoslavia, while about 70 per cent were divided between Comecon, the now
defunct socialist trading block, and western European countries. But
following an embargo by Serbia on Slovene imports in 1990, and ensuing war
in neighbouring Croatia last year, Slovene exports to the former Yugoslavia
have fallen to 15 per cent of that previously.
The loss of markets in the former Yugoslavia, and the war, has led to a
sharp drop in industrial production, which last year fell by 15 per cent,
and will fall a further 12 per cent this year.
Unemployment has risen to 101,000, up from 9 per cent to 11 per cent of the
labour force. However, inflation is falling thanks to a strong monetary
policy implemented by Slovenia's central bank. Inflation was running at 25
per cent a month last October, but by April it had fallen to 5 per cent.
Mr Feri Horvath, head of Slovenia's Chamber of Commerce, said Slovenia,
which declared its independence last June, must seek new markets because the
republic is too small to be able to attract large amounts of foreign
investment to foster growth.
Renault, French car manufacturer, which assembles cars in Slovenia, and
Siemens, German-based mechanical and electrical goods maker, which has a
joint venture with Iskra, Slovenia's electronic and telecommunications
manufacturer, have used Slovenia as a base for exporting to other parts of
Yugoslavia, as well as to western Europe.
'We have recently signed bilateral trade agreements with Croatia and
Macedonia,' said Mr Horvath. 'We want to normalise relations with the other
republics,' he added.
In the meantime, Slovene enterprises, particularly those in the furniture,
electronics, paper, and white goods sector, are exporting to European
Community countries.
Exports for the first quarter amounted to Dollars 941m (Pounds 513m), and
imports totalled Dollars 752m. Last year, total exports of goods reached
Dollars 3.9bn, and imports, Dollars 4.1bn.
'Our enterprises are beginning to find new markets,' said Mr Horvath, adding
that Germany, Italy, France and Austria are now Slovenia's main trading
partners.
Mrs Vojka Ravbar, Slovenia's deputy foreign minister, who earlier this week
headed a trade delegation to the UK, said enterprises will have to become
even more competitive after privatisation. Parliament is now discussing a
privatisation bill.

FT  22 MAY 92 / EC backs radical farm reform: Deep cuts in price support
expected to boost Uruguay Round talks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GARDNER

<DATELINE>
   BRUSSELS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Community last night agreed on the most radical overhaul of the
Common Agricultural Policy in its 30-year history.
It followed up with a challenge to the US to match the Community's deep cuts
in farm price support and to join in trying to reach a conclusion of the
Uruguay Round world trade talks.
The EC agreement, greeted as historic by nearly all Community farm
ministers, should lead to the end of food mountains in Europe, lower retail
food prices and give EC farmers more stable incomes and a sharper
competitive edge.
Accord was reached in the face of continued resistance from Italy over its
milk quota. Mr Ray MacSharry, EC agriculture commissioner, said: 'We have
charted a different course after 30 years.'
Mr Louis Mermaz, French agriculture minister, hailed the accord as 'a
fundamental change from traditional (EC) agriculture towards a competitive
model, with, of course, compensation for our farmers'.
Mr John Gummer, UK farm minister, called it 'a major breakthrough which will
bring the Community into line with the rest of the world'.
Mr MacSharry's blueprint for reform, unanimously opposed when it was
unveiled 18 months ago, finally won acceptance this week after four days and
three nights of negotiations.
Italy, although in agreement with the reform, held out until last night for
retrospective validation for part of its illicit excess milk production.
Italy, entitled to produce 9m tonnes of milk by the EC, in fact produces
11.5m tonnes.
By dawn yesterday, however, Mr MacSharry had assembled a clear majority,
partly by offering a range of concessions. The Portuguese presidency of the
EC put the package through under the weighted majority voting system.
Mr Arlindo Cunha, Portugal's farm minister, said: 'We took our political
courage in our hands.'
Mr Giovanni Goria, Italy's farm minister, said Rome would take the dispute
to June's Lisbon summit of EC heads of government.
At the centre of the package is a 29 per cent cut in cereals prices over
three years, which should lead to cheaper feeds for livestock, enabling a 15
per cent cut in beef price supports, and a 5 per cent cut in the butter
price. Sheep and beef will now be subject to quotas like milk.
The cuts are designed to move EC agriculture towards world prices. Farmers
are fully compensated for them directly, but big farmers have to take 15 per
cent of their land out of production to get these payments.
The cuts should eliminate export subsidies almost entirely by 1996-97. This,
and the EC's new ability to guarantee restraints on production, should give
momentum to the Uruguay Round negotiations between the US and EC, due next
week.
Mr MacSharry said: 'We can say, with our chests out and our heads held high,
and with pride, that you (the US) match what we have done, and then we can
get progress.'
A spokesman for the US trade representative said: 'We are hopeful that
reform would bring the EC's internal prices closer to world prices, and
promote greater and fairer competition in EC and world markets. Also, we
hope that the (CAP) agreement would allow the EC greater flexibility in the
multilateral agricultural reform effort under way in the Uruguay Round.'
Early today New Zealand, a member of the Cairns Group of agricultural
exporting nations which has been critical of the EC, gave a cautious welcome
to the agreement. . Mr Philip Burdon, trade minister, said: 'It's a good
sign, but it's not a black and white picture.'
Mr MacSharry insisted that the US should now accept the EC's demands that
its direct compensation payments to farmers be allowed under General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (Gatt) rules for subsidies which do not
increase production and therefore distort trade.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Major gives warm welcome to accord
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS and DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN MAJOR gave an enthusiastic welcome to the farm talks deal yesterday.
He said an agreement on reforming the Common Agricultural Policy would be
good for farmers, consumers and the future of world trade.
Although consumers will have to wait until the middle of the decade before
benefiting from cheaper food prices, British farmers welcomed the end of the
uncertainty surrounding their businesses.
'It would appear that John Gummer (agriculture minister) has achieved quite
a remarkable victory on behalf of all UK arable farmers,' the managing
director of a large farming company said.
He was delighted that Britain had not been left at a disadvantage to smaller
European competitors.
Speaking in the House of Commons, Mr Major said that the deal was good news
for the British farmer, for the British consumer, for the General Agreement
on Tariffs and Trade negotiations, for world trade and for many developing
countries.
He congratulated Mr Gummer on his negotiating stance during the marathon
Brussels negotiating session.
The prime minister made it clear that the accord was closely in tune with
the thrust of Britain's own proposals, which were designed to protect
farmers while progressively reducing the EC's massive stocks of agricultural
products.
Whitehall officials said that the proposed shift towards a system of farm
payments tied to supporting incomes rather than paying for surpluses could
provide the background for a deal with the US in the stalled Uruguay round
of world trade talks.
More specifically, they welcomed the fact that the proposals to compensate
cereals farmers for taking land out of production took account of the much
larger average size of British farms.
Labour warned that the reforms were as likely to fail in reducing surpluses
as previous efforts had been.
Mr David Clark, shadow agriculture minister, said that the only effects
would be that 'the cost to the UK taxpayers will increase in each of the
next few years; the consumer will not benefit; farmers will get large
pay-offs.'
While Britain's farmers expressed relief that uncertainty had been resolved,
reaction in France was tougher, where farmers condemned the deal and said
that they would take to the streets immediately in protest.
German farmers said subsidy cuts would lead to collapse in many farm
regions, which would be hit by drastic price cuts in grain and other crops.
Italian farming lobbies reacted angrily to reforms which left their country
out in the cold. 'This is a completely unsatisfactory deal,' an association
of farmers said.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Tories shrug off backbench revolt on Maastricht
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE LEGISLATION to ratify the Maastricht Treaty on European union passed its
most important parliamentary hurdle last night as the government shrugged
off a rebellion by anti-federalist Conservative MPs.
The House of Commons voted by an overwhelming majority of 336 to 92 to
endorse the deal negotiated by Mr John Major on closer European integration.
Some 22 Conservative rebels opposed ratification of the treaties on European
and Monetary Union, arguing that they represented a further step along the
road to federalism and a handful of others abstained. Mr John Biffen, a
former cabinet minister, was among those refusing to back Mr Major.
But the government's discomfort was matched by acute embarrassment among the
Labour leadership after 61 of the party's Euro-sceptic MPs rejected
instructions to abstain and instead voted against ratification. A Labour
amendment calling on the government to opt-in to the social policies adopted
by the other 11 EC countries was defeated by 360 to 261 votes.
The backing for the government at the end of the two-day debate followed a
strong defence of the Maastricht accord by Mr Douglas Hurd, the foreign
secretary. He argued that it had produced a treaty which 'more closely
mirrors British priorities than any of its predecessors'.
Emphasising that the intergovernmental structure of the agreement had halted
the march towards more centralised decision-making, Mr Hurd said Britain now
had 'a real chance' to shape the EC's institutions.
He stressed that the prospective enlargement of the Community to include
northern European states would not force Britain to concede further changes
in those institutions before the proposed review in 1996.
Mr Norman Lamont, the chancellor, meanwhile sought to reassure Conservative
MPs that the staged process of monetary union did not threaten the
government's rights to decide independently Britain's tax and spending
levels.
Sir Edward Heath, the former prime minister, enlivened the debate with a
stinging if thinly-veiled attack on the views of his successor in Downing
Street, Mrs Margaret Thatcher. But he combined criticism of 'bigoted' and
'xenophobic' attacks on Germany with criticism of Mr Major for not going far
enough to embrace closer integration.
The Tory rebels indicated that they intended to continue to harry the
legislation when it moves to its detailed committee stage early next month.
A group of five Tory MPs last night tabled a series of amendments designed
to stall progress.
One amendment calls for an advisory referendum before Maastricht is enacted
while another aims to limit severely the government's ability to strike
deals in Brussels without the consent of parliament.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (11): Hopes pinned on new canal - The Port
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of the iron curtain has already brought about a huge increase
in the traffic in people and services between eastern and western Europe
through Vienna.
It is widely expected that the volume of goods moving through the city will
also rise rapidly. According to some estimates, the volume of cargo moving
in central Europe could triple by the end of the century.
So far, however, the break-up of eastern Europe has had mainly a negative
effect on the port of Vienna. For example, much of the drilling pipe for the
Russian oil industry used to pass through Vienna, but this trade has
collapsed because Russia does not have currency with which to buy oil pipe.
Also, the war in Yugoslavia last year dampened trade through the lower
Danube.
But over the longer term, there is considerable optimism. Mr Ronald Schrems,
marketing director of the port of Vienna corporation (Wiener Hafen),
predicted that transshipment tonnage - that is, freight moving from road to
water or water to rail - handled in the port would double from a depressed
2m tonnes in 1990 over the next five years.
Perhaps a more important factor in the anticipated rise in business will be
the long-awaited opening in September of the Rhine-Main-Danube canal. This
canal, which rises over high ground between Regensburg and Bamberg in
Germany, was first conceived by Charlemagne. When it opens in September, it
will make possible uninterrupted transport of goods by water between
Rotterdam and the Black Sea.
Wiener Hafen estimates that between 4m and 7m tonnes per year of goods will
be carried on the waterway, although much depends on the freight rates
established.
Much uncertainty surrounds this issue. For one thing, there is, at the
moment, much more traffic moving from west to east than from east to west.
This tends to push rates up. However, the Danube shipping fleet is dominated
by eastern European companies, which do not yet run on normal economic
criteria.
Freight volumes are unlikely to be large enough to permit specialised
container ships, and the Main-Danube canal has height limits that prevent
stacking containers high enough to be profitable.
'The main traffic will be bulk commodities and cars,' Mr Schrems says.
Vienna already plays a significant role as a transshipment port, shifting
all manner of goods, including 20,000 cars per year, between the water and
land transport modes.
The port, which is owned by the city of Vienna, handled a total 10m tonnes
of goods last year, of which 8m were solely handled by truck and rail. With
its seven associated companies, it had a turnover of Sch320m and a cash flow
of Sch50m.
The port has a customs-free area of about 150,000 square metres and 50,000
square metres of roofed space. The container terminal handled more 100,000
units last year. There is also a 90,000-tonne grain terminal, which has
handled large shipments bound for the former Soviet Union. A crude oil
terminal connects to a pipeline to Trieste.
More than 1m tonnes of crude oil and oil products were transshipped on the
Danube from Vienna last year. The port also is a large stocking point for
cars, especially those imported from Japan.
In anticipation of sharply increased demand and the new dynamics on the
Danube, the port has set up new subsidiary c o n t a i n e r t e r m i n a l
s at Bratislava and Krems in the past two years, is opening one at Budapest
this year and intends to build one soon at Belgrade.
It is also in negotiation to purchase in partnership with German interests
the cargo division of the venerable but failing Donaudampfschiffahrts (DDSG)
shipping group. It hopes that returns on shipping, especially between Vienna
and the Rhine ports, will be more satisfactory than those on the Danube
alone.
Mr Schrems says the Austrian part of this project alone would cost Sch7bn,
even though no locks would need to be built. In Moravia, the waterway was
prepared in the 1930s, so the politically difficult part of land acquisition
is complete. But locks have still to be built.
As part of a four-year, Sch250m capital spending programme, the port is
seeking to buy more land and to enlarge roofed storage space to about 75,000
square metres.
Even though the Rhine-Main-Danube canal has not opened yet, Vienna port
officials are already thinking about another canal. It would link Vienna to
Moravia to join up with an existing - but undeveloped - waterway to the Oder
and the Elbe.
He admits that the project could not be justified by traffic forecasts
alone. However, both the Austrian and Czech authorities are pointing out
that it offers an opportunity to bring black coal from Rotterdam for
Moravian power stations. This would reduce substantially the carbon dioxide
emissions from the stations.
They are trying to convince the European Commission and the European Bank
for Reconstruction and Development that this is a good project for their
environmental protection funds. 'We hope for a decision within the next two
years,' Mr Schrems says.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (10): The last tram from Stammersdorf - Ian Hamilton
Fazey offers a visitor's guide
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF THE British have to hear the first cuckoo to know spring has arrived, the
Viennese need no such natural signal. Spring comes with the opening of the
city's famous Eissalon at Schwedenplatz, Vienna's equivalent of Piccadilly
Circus.
The Wienerwald - the Vienna Woods - may be hardly in bud, but when the
tables are set out on the pavement outside the ice cream parlour, that is
the sign that winter has officially ended.
Summer ends with similar ceremony on October 1: the Eissalon retreats
indoors, while the hot chestnut and roasted sliced-potato sellers set up
their cupboards and braziers by Schwedenplatz's tram and U-bahn interchange.
Trams and tube trains pull away with happy travellers sustaining themselves
on whichever is the appropriate seasonal fare: something to cool you down in
the heat or warm you up in the cold. A time-and-temperature sign on a facing
office block across the adjacent Donaukanal confirms whether you should feel
comforted or guilty at indulging in yet another Viennese temptation.
Vienna may be the archetypal cafe society, but the cafes are only a part of
the temptation. The Heuriger is an equally dangerous place. While the cafe
exposes the waistline to the perils of Torte and Kuchen - tarts and cakes -
the Heuriger seduces the unwary with Gruner Veltliner.
Heurigen are wine bars, sometimes found in cellars, and Veltliner is the
grape that does best locally. The white, dry wine travels especially well
between cup and lip, and comes by the viertel, or quarter-litre. It goes
down like water.
Most Heurigen are in the countryside around Vienna, near the vineyards, and
are the closest thing Vienna has to the English country pub; but there are
also others in the city centre, known as Stadt Heurigen.
The Gigerl, 10 minutes' walk from the Opera and near the Stephansdom - St
Stephen's Cathedral - is in a small cobbled street facing the back door to
the British Bookshop and is always full of Viennese. It is a favourite for
pre- or after-opera suppers. Bookings are usually necessary.
They all serve modestly-priced hot food, sold and served over a counter,
with dishes including schnitzel, roast pork, roast half-chickens, home-made
meat, torte or mushroom, spinach or onion pie.
In the autumn, the Heurigen hang wreathes of vine leaves over their front
doors to announce the harvest is in and that the first pressings of new wine
are available for tasting. The concoction comes in viertel mugs and is so
cloudy it is hardly translucent, let alone transparent.
In the Vienna suburb of Grinzing or nearby villages like Stammersdorf,
Strebersdorf or Gumpoldskirchen, Heurigen come by the kilometre, packed
side-by-side along high streets. Autumn evenings are filled with the sound
of oom-pah bands and accordions as thousands of people give in to temptation
 -if indeed they ever tried to resist it in the first place.
If the prospect does not at first appeal to the visitor, a viertel or two
soon produces remarkable conversions.
A quieter time may be had in the cafes, possibly with a little Gershwin
tinkling out from a baby grand in the corner. There is plenty of Veltliner
on tap here, but you will pay more. You can also have a properly served
meal, and most cafes usually have their own specialities on offer.
The most famous cafes include the Central, in Herrengasse, Landtmann, near
the Rathaus and Burgtheater, Demel in the Kohlmarkt - possibly the most
mouth-watering cream cake emporium in the world - and the Griensteidl in
Michaelerplatz, by the imposing portal to the Alte Hofburg palace.
All are well-appointed, with tourist prices, but are worth it for the
atmosphere. Cafe Hawelka, off the Graben near the Stephansdom, is rougher
but still chic. However, if you want a comfortable hour away from city
centre bustle, Cafe Schottenring, opposite the Borse, or stock exchange, is
a cosy winner.
Coffee is an art in itself in the cafes, where it is never referred to as
such. An espresso is a kleine Mocha and a large one with milk, a grosse
Brauner. A Melange has the cream whipped in, while an Einspanner comes with
a huge dollop of whipped cream floating on top and should only be combined
with a helping of Torte and cream if you really want to be sick.
One overriding factor makes this recreational eating and drinking market
possible - Vienna's size. The Habsburg empire may have ultimately got too
big for its boots but the importance of Budapest and Prague to that empire
helped ensure that Vienna as a city never did.
Today, it is growing slowly but there are still only 1.5m people there -
small for a capital city of such historical, if not modern-day political
significance. The city centre remains entirely 'walkable', thanks to the
walls which once hemmed medieval Vienna against the original course of the
Danube at its confluence with the Wien. Across the river Wien, incidentally,
is the Landstrasse, where, according to Napoleon, the Balkans begin.
When the city walls were demolished in the 19th century to allow Vienna's
expansion, the military advisers of the Emperor Franz-Josef insisted they be
turned into a wide, circular boulevard with plenty of clear, open spaces.
This was to give imperial troops clear lines of fire against the
proletariat, should revolution ever threaten the Hofburg. The benefit today
is that this policy created the Ringstrasse, Europe's first inner ring road.
Combined with a middle ring road called the Gurtel, it helps keep the danger
of gridlock to a minimum, even in the worst of weather and rush hours.
It is, however, the combination of a small city with a superb, integrated,
public transport that makes uninhibited enjoyment of Vienna possible in the
age of the breathalyser. A combination of bus, train, tram and underground
provide a possibly peerless network for getting about.
Since 1967, the Austrian and Vienna authorities have spent nearly Sch42bn
(Pounds 2bn) on a 41km, five-lines, underground network. Another Sch15.5bn
(Pounds 740m) has been committed for extensions before the end of the
century.
This combines with nearly 250km of tramway, carrying 35 lines, and with a
total of 991 stops dotted throughout the city and its environs. If evidence
were needed that infrastructure begets markets, Vienna's figures provide it.
In the decade to 1990, the number of passengers using Vienna's public
transport system rose by 36 per cent from 450.7m to 611.8m. This was in
spite of an increase in the number of cars in the city from 476,553 to
546,945 - up 15 per cent.
A weekly season ticket - good for train, U-bahn or bus - costs Sch125 (a
little over Pounds 6). Small wonder the last No. 31 tram on Saturday night,
from the Heurigen of Stammersdorf to the Schottenring connection for
Schwedenplatz, should always be full of mellow, happy people.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (8): Some signs of nervousness - Property Market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS a strange bird, this Viennese property market. Until the early 1980s,
there was no genuine commercial development to speak of, as some of the
world's most restrictive rental laws made it virtually impossible to build
for profit. In 1981, a new law permitted developers for the first time to
set their commercial rents and terms of contracts freely, at least in
buildings completed after 1967.
The vast stock of older buildings in Vienna, where most offices are still
located, remained under strict rent control laws. It took a few more years,
and more legal changes, for the first profit-oriented development projects
to spring up, mostly on the city periphery.
The majority of the big office buildings completed by the late 1980s had
been built by banks, insurance companies or public institutions for their
own use. But with the help of sustained economic growth in the late 1980s,
the opening of eastern Europe and the plans for a world fair to be held
jointly with Budapest in 1995, commercial development took off in 1990, and
prices went through the roof.
The World Trade Centre at Vienna Airport, one of the first modern office
buildings built for profit, filled up quickly, as did several premises
combining hotels, shops and offices.
But, as more office space is coming to the market, developers are showing
signs of nervousness. Rentals for top locations and high-quality offices are
still rising fast, but filling new buildings at the city outskirts is no
longer that easy. Last year, 20 new projects added 74,000 sq metres of new
office space. The increase is estimated at 180,000 sq metres for this year
and 175,000 sq metres for next year. A further 600,000 sq metres is in the
planning stages.
Yields at many completed projects are well below the 5 per cent set as a
minimum by international investors. The most prominent failure is the Haas
Haus, near St Stephen's Cathedral, perhaps the city's most impressive
location. The innovative building has been an architectural triumph for its
designer Hans Hollein, but it is a commercial flop for the Austrian banks
which own most of the property.
Sales in the exclusive stores on the lower levels fell short of
expectations, as did rentals of the high-priced offices. Developers say
there is enough potential demand to fill all these premises. The problem is
how to convince hundreds of small companies and professionals with offices
in residential buildings in the city centre to move to new high-tech offices
at the periphery.
'Once people realise that their old offices lack facilities such as doormen,
centralised cleaning services, air conditioning and modern wiring, there
should be strong demand,' says Mr Martin Engelberg, local project manager of
the Concorde Business Park, a multi-purpose development near the airport.
'But people have overestimated the mobility of tenants.'
Moreover, Austrian developers are still beginners when it comes to
marketing, he adds. For commercial reasons, the Austrian government is
planning to set a good example. Government ministries and offices, occupying
some of the choice buildings in the centre, are set to move to new
accommodation in the suburbs. Even the finance ministry has now decided to
abandon one of the city's most beautiful baroque palaces, and the
administration of Lower Austria, the province surrounding Vienna, will move
to the new state capital at St Polten.
These transfers will release some coveted real estate in Vienna, which the
government can sell or rent out at top prices. Even as some of the new
office centres are sailing into troubled water, sails are not being struck.
Office rents continue to rise, and are reaching levels seen in other
European cities. After climbing 10 per cent in 1990, rents at high-quality
locations jumped another 30 per cent last year to an average of Sch180 a sq
metre. Rents at the best properties in Vienna's fashionable city centre
advanced to Sch350 a sq metre last year from about Sch260 a year before.
Analysts do not see an end to that trend. 'Top office rentals in Munich and
Dusseldorf are a bit higher, those in Brussels and Hamburg a bit lower than
in Vienna,' says Mr Manfred Weidmann, real estate analyst at Creditanstalt.
'Given its role in the world economy, international real estate experts no
longer consider Vienna to be cheap. Comparisons with cities like London,
Paris or Frankfurt are not appropriate.'
Optimism in the real estate market was dampened a year ago when the Vienna
electorate, in a surprise move, voted against plans for a world fair. In the
months leading to the referendum, hopes that the Expo project would lead to
a sustained real estate boom had boosted prices for commercial and
residential property, especially in the area near the designated site at the
banks of the Danube. But even before the world fair plans collapsed,
analysts were predicting the bubble would burst.
A major challenge for the Vienna property market is the development of the
original Expo site, set in a sparsely populated district across the Danube.
Shortly after the referendum, the leaders of the investment consortium opted
to go ahead with construction of a major office and residential development.
Nomura, the Japanese brokerage house, several Austrian banks and development
companies owned by the city of Vienna set up the Vienna Development Company
for the Danube Area (WED) to develop the Sch15bn Donau-City, which they say
is Europe's third largest urban development project. But the final designs
and the financing for the project, which should offer 365,000 sq metres of
offices, apartments and recreational activities, are still evolving.
WED wants to start preliminary construction this summer and complete the
first units in 1997. It is intended that Donau-City should create a second
commercial and residential centre outside the city's historical core. The
property is located next to the international centre, which houses the
headquarters of several UN agencies, and a large recreational area on the
Danube.
In line with Vienna's ecological image, WED wants to create ample green
space between the buildings, but whether the project should include
high-rise towers in an otherwise low-rise city is a question still being
debated. Adjacent to Donau-City and the UN centre, the federal government is
preparing for another major construction site to house the new UN chemical
weapons agency. Vienna is bidding against the Hague and Geneva for its
headquarters.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (7): Airport may become competitive - Judy Dempsey
previews next month's flotation and considers its impact
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUDY DEMPSEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
VIENNA International Airport (VIA) is set to be the second airport group in
the world to seek flotation on the public market. In joining the British
Airports Authority (BAA), VIA is likely to become more competitive and will
be well placed to promote itself as a potential hub.
Early next month, between 5.3m and 5.5m new bearer shares, each with a
nominal value of Sch100 and representing 27 per cent of the enlarged share
capital, will be sold to the public. Proceeds from the issue will raise
about Sch1.8bn.
The flotation means that the three current shareholders - the Republic of
Austria, (which holds 50 per cent), the province of Lower Austria (25 per
cent) and the City of Vienna (25 per cent), will have their share capital
reduced to 36.5, 18.25 and 18.25 per cent respectively.
Two-thirds of the listed shares will be earmarked for the domestic market,
with VIA employees having the opportunity to buy 16 per cent of those
shares. The remaining third will be set aside for the international market.
The VIA authorities decided to seek a flotation on the public market for two
reasons. First, it requires capital to complete the expansion and
modernisation of the airport, probably one of the most 'user-friendly'
airports in the region. Second, it is setting its sights on becoming a key
secondary hub for central Europe.
Expansion is vital if VIA is to tap the potential of the two runways which
can cope with 300,000 movements (landings) a year, including night-time
flying for Stage 3 aircraft. Movements are currently running at
approximately 130,000 a year, largely because the terminals can at present
deal only with 6m passengers a year. The two runways have the potential to
handle 20m passengers a year.
Several investment programmes aimed at modernising the airport have recently
been completed. Between 1989 and 1990, Sch1.8bn was invested on expanding
the departure terminal facilities and the arrivals terminal, and building an
eight-storey car park.
Current investments include the extension of the passenger terminal, the
check-in hall, arrival hall and transit area, to twice their capacity, or
twice in size by the end of 1992. Investments for 1992 will total Sch1.7bn,
and Sch1.3bn in 1993.
But what is the attraction of Vienna airport? Those who have lived there and
have used the airport to fly to eastern Europe, acknowledge the relatively
high standard of services and the manageable size of the airport, where,
unlike some European airports, passengers do not have to walk long distances
to the gates.
Yet, despite Vienna's proximity to central Europe, over the years VIA
curiously failed to attract any significant cargo or transit passengers.
Little emphasis was placed on freight traffic.
With the construction of warehousing and a freight forwarding building, VIA
is determined to tap this market. The decision by Austrian Airways (AUA) to
operate DC9s in the late 1970s partly explains why attention to freight and
cargo was minimal: DC9s have little cargo space.
Moreover, VIA also failed to tap the potential of the airport as a transit
airport. Between 1987 and 1991 transit traffic has remained around 250,000 a
year, despite the revolutions which swept eastern Europe in 1989. Officials
and bankers involved in the flotation admit that VIA - and AUA - have to
adopt a much more aggressive marketing strategy to get passengers to use the
airport as a transit to the capitals of eastern Europe.
But the opening of eastern Europe and the Commonwealth of Independent
States, means that Vienna airport, including its ancillary services, will
have to be more competitive. Austrian Airways, which until recently held a
near monopoly in Austria and the charter-flight sector, remains expensive;
duty-free is almost prohibitive, and on airport charges (including landing
fees) it ranks eighth highest in the world.
VIA's aeronautical activities are regulated by a pricing formula set by the
Austrian Ministry of Transport. A public flotation should make VIA more
competitive.
In the meantime, VIA is in the process of promoting its main strengths:
growth in passengers. The opening up of eastern Europe expands its catchment
area - from 3m people - Vienna and its conurbations  - to 14m encompassing
Budapest, Prague, Bratislava and Zagreb. Passenger volume has grown above 10
per cent every year since 1987. The Gulf war and the Yugoslav crisis in 1991
broke that growth.
congestion at other major European airports. In contrast to many of Europe's
major airports, airspace over Vienna, and aircraft ground handling
facilities are not overloaded.
development as a second-tier hub for two types of transfer traffic: traffic
between east and west Europe, and long haul traffic whose ultimate
destination is a secondary location in Europe (probably eastern Europe).
If the flotation is coupled with a marketing strategy designed to highlight
these features, and if the flotation will make the services at VIA more
competitive, Vienna can hardly lose.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna 4: (9): Dramas made out of a crisis - The federal
theatre's problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Bundestheater Verband, the Austrian federal theatre company, has seen
its share of troubles in recent months. First came a public storm over the
director of the Burgtheater, Mr Claus Peymann, whose contract was renewed
despite widespread condemnation of his management style.
Just when the controversy regarding Austria's foremost theatre abated and
the outspoken Viennese audiences had settled back to grumbling quietly about
falling standards and neglect of tradition, the director of the State Opera
died of a heart attack at the end of March, after only seven months in the
office.
The death of Eberhard Waechter, who was 62, 'is a disaster for the
Staatsoper,' says Mr Georg Springer, the general manager of Bundestheater.
'Waechter had been the reason for a major structural change at the opera.'
One of world's leading baritones, Waechter had been manager of the smaller
Volksoper, or People's Opera, and his appointment as Staatsoper director put
the two houses for the first time under a single leadership. As a result,
smaller productions could be shifted to the Volksoper, used predominantly
for operettas, thus raising its often belittled artistic level.
The void left by Waechter will be hard to fill. Mr Ian Holender, co-director
of the Staatsoper in change of administration, was immediately named to lead
the two institutions by himself, but that is seen as an interim solution.
Without Waechter's authority, Mr Holender will have a hard time to carry out
the new concept of opera management that was introduced last year amid loud
protests by Vienna's artistic opinion-makers.
The double crisis at the Bundestheater is no small affair for Vienna. The
state-owned theatre group claims to be the world largest stage company, with
annual turnover of more than Sch2bn. As only a quarter of that is met by
ticket sales, covering the deficit is a constant and growing burden on
Austria's federal budget.
The four theatres of the Bundestheater play a central role in Austria's
art-obsessed capital. The Staatsoper, in a league only with the Metropolitan
Opera in New York and the Scala in Milan, is Vienna's greatest tourist
attraction, and the Burgtheater and its smaller offshoot, the
Akademietheater, aspire to lead the German-speaking drama world.
Debates over personnel and policy decisions at the theatres regularly fill
the pages of Austrian newspapers and preoccupy the intellectual and social
elites in the city for weeks.
At the Burgtheater, German-born Mr Peymann has aroused the ire of the
conservative audience with innovative plays and staging approaches since
coming to Vienna from Bochum in 1986. He brought a group of excellent German
actors with him, driving many of local favourites, with life-time contracts
at the Burgtheater, off the stage.
Critics claim that he has concentrated too much on showpiece productions,
many of them directed by himself, while neglecting the day-to-day operations
of the theatre. Those voices grew louder at the beginning of the year when
extended rehearsals for a Macbeth production directed by Mr Peymann forced
the Burgtheater to keep its doors shut for more than a dozen nights. The
cancellations upset the theatre's most loyal audience, the holders of season
tickets, and prompted some to return their tickets, which are often passed
down from generation to generation.
However, the opening of Macbeth was a success, like most of Mr Peymann's
cherished Shakespeare productions, but reviewers suggested that he could
have achieved the same with less turmoil.
'The shock over Macbeth went deep,' says Mr Springer, the Bundestheater
manager. 'Peymann had to learn the hard way that as a manager, he cannot
afford to be put in such a position by Peymann, the artist.'
When Mr Rudolf Scholten, Austria's minister of education and the arts,
extended Mr Peymann's contract in February just before the opening of
Macbeth, it sparked a revolt among the Burgtheater's disgruntled staff. The
actors' council, including Mr Klaus Maria Brandauer, resigned in protest and
demanded fundamental change.
Mr Springer says the dispute between Mr Peymann and the actors has so far
not been resolved. 'The peace (in the theatre) is not one of satisfaction or
resignation, but it's the peace of the graveyard,' he says. 'The atmosphere
in the house is worrying.'
A very different strategy was adopted by Eberhard Waechter and Mr Holender,
the former owner of a major artists' agency. Rather than pouring millions
into a few star productions, the two managers undertook an overhaul of the
regular nightly programme seen by most tourists and regular local visitors.
'The repertory was rotten. It was high time to improve it - it had fallen
apart materially and artistically,' says Mr Springer.
Rather than depend solely on international stars, the Waechter/Holender team
started to build up a reservoir of younger singers who would stay with the
opera for a few years. The price was to do without any new productions in
the first season, which the public did not seem to mind, but many art
critics called a sell-out.
Mr Springer says the attacks on the concept were 'not only nonsense, but
infamy'. In the season starting in September the Staatsoper has scheduled as
many new productions as in the past, including all of Richard Wagner's 'Ring
der Nibelungen' cycle. The Staatsoper is also sponsoring three new opera
compositions over the next five years.
While the joint management between Staatsoper and Volksoper is likely to
end, as Mr Holender is apparently not interested in leading both opera
houses, Mr Springer says he is aiming for a closer co-operation of the
Staatsoper with the city-owned Theater an der Wien, one of its oldest
theatres and today its main stage for musicals.
When Mr Peter Weck, director of that theatre, staged one of the world's best
productions of Andrew Lloyd Webber's Cats in 1983 and managed to fill the
auditorium for seven seasons, Vienna's city officials thought they had found
the key to commercial success.
Mr Weck was made director of all three theatres owned by the city, where he
continued to stage international blockbuster musicals. But even he failed to
turn in a profit, and as his contract expires at the end of this year, a new
manager is sought who could broaden the theatres' repertory beyond the
standard London and New York musicals.
The city is also looking for a private operator at the Ronacher, a
120-year-old variety theatre now under Mr Weck's directorship. This run-down
hall needs renovation. Blueprints for construction of a Sch900m multi-stage
centre by the avant-garde architecture firm Coop Himmelblau were recently
abandoned in favour of a less expensive, less interesting design.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (5): How waste has been cut - Ian Rodger on the
environmentally conscious Viennese
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FEW CITY dwellers in the industrialised world are as environmentally
conscious as those of Vienna. The city government, with solid support from
its residents, has in recent years cracked down on industrial emissions and
is slowly turning the screws on car traffic.
Catalytic converters for cars have been compulsory since 1987 and leaded
petrol will be prohibited from next year. Permanent parking on main streets
in the city will be outlawed from next year as well.
Meanwhile, the city has been improving its public transport system, already
an easy-to-use network of underground trains, high speed suburban trains,
trams and buses. On the energy front, it continues to put the emphasis on
renewable sources of power, with a Sch15bn hydro plant on the Danube
downriver from Vienna due to come on stream next year.
However, the city's most impressive achievement in the past few years has
undoubtedly been its attack on rubbish. This attack is immediately apparent
to every visitor because of the ubiquitous different coloured rubbish bins,
each indicating the kind of rubbish you are supposed to put in them, located
at every main square, outside underground stations and on pavements at
regular intervals.
There are, at a recent count, no fewer than seven categories - organic,
paper, plastic, metal, aluminium cans, clear glass and coloured glass - into
which residents are supposed to divide their rubbish. In addition, dead
batteries must be returned to special collection points.
It is all part of a programme begun by the city five years ago to slow the
inexorable growth in rubbish tonnage. It was also aimed to allow the
Viennese, who were known to be ecology conscious, to do something concrete
to help in the cause of a better environment.
Mr Michael Haupl, city councillor responsible for environment, recreation
and sports, is convinced of the programme's success. In 1990, the average
inhabitant generated 299.6 kilograms of rubbish, 11.7kg less than in the
previous year.
Mr Haupl, a biologist by training, says the response of Viennese has been
outstanding. Last year, 180,000 tonnes of waste material was recovered for
recycling, and he predicts the city will be recycling 30 per cent of its
rubbish - the programme's target - by 1994.
This has been achieved without any legal pressure or sanctions on people.
'Theoretically, there are laws, and fines to punish people who do not
co-operate, but we do not think it would be sensible to impose them. We work
at trying to raise awareness in people to motivate them to do it,' he says.
He acknowledges that the city's net operating costs for waste disposal, even
after taking account of revenues from sales of recyclable material, have
risen because of the complicated logistics of the programme. But he suspects
that the increment is only a small proportion of the overall 25 per cent
rise in rubbish levies in the past five years. 'Most of it is for new
equipment, such as filters and scrubbers, and for capital improvements to
the two existing incinerators.'
The most important saving, though, is that the city will not have to build a
new incinerator. Mr Haupl says the city recognised five years that it had to
try to do something to stop the growth of rubbish generation. Apart from the
high cost of building new dumps, it would face strong opposition from
environmental groups to establishing new ones, so it set out to get around
the need to set up new waste-handling facilities.
The next stages of the programme involve encouraging people to reduce their
generation of waste and getting industry involved. 'So far, we have worked
only at the domestic level. We are starting to require large businesses to
set up policies to reduce waste and maximise recycling,' Mr Haupl says.
He also wants to work more on other environmental problems, including the
excessive use of cars in the city. 'That is our biggest problem, in terms of
air pollution.' Already a third of cars in the city have catalytic
converters, but he says progress in improving air quality is too slow. 'The
Viennese are schizophrenic about cars. They are even fonder of them than
Italians, but they want their life to be free of the problems caused by
cars.'
He says he welcomes the presence of Green party representatives at City Hall
since the election last November, because they are very helpful in
counteracting the political strength of the car lobby.
Mr Haupl acknowledges that Zurich has succeeded in discouraging car traffic
through rigid road engineering and severe limitations on parking places, but
he points out that this has led to the emergence of a political party in
Switzerland that favours easing controls on cars.
Another problem that is hard to deal with is caused by dogs. Vienna has
about 100,000 of these, relatively high by European standards. 'It is not a
problem of dogs, but of dog owners. They think there should be a city
official walking along behind them picking up after their dogs,' he says.
The city tries its best, frequently replacing sand in park sand boxes and
creating places for dogs to do their business, but it seems to be a losing
battle.
Still, the Viennese are proud of their record on the environment, so much so
that they fear joining the European Community on the grounds that EC
standards are lower than Austrian ones.
Mr Haupl dismisses this view as too simplified. In controlling air
pollution, Austria is more advanced than the EC, but the EC's water
standards are higher than Austria's. 'In any event, the EC regulations do
not prevent you from exceeding their standards.'

FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (6): For culture, look no further - Tourism
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   WHAT COULD Vienna
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
and Austria, as a whole, for that matter - possibly do for an encore after
celebrating the bicentennial of Mozart's death?
The answer, which is already being transmitted round the world by the
Austrian National Tourist Office, is to prepare for the millenium of the
founding of Austria in 996.
While that event in itself is no more likely to excite foreign tourists than
did the 700th anniversary of the founding of the Swiss confederation last
year, the Austrians are cunningly combining it over the next four years with
various significant dates in the long and distinguished history of the
Habsburg dynasty.
This year, for example, an exhibition of historical materials is being
presented in Seville and in Salzburg on Austrian links with Spain at the
time of the discovery of America 500 years ago. The discovery coincided with
the formation of the Casa de Austria in Spain by King Maximilian I and the
subsequent empire of Karl V on which the sun never set.
All of this is in aid of what is known as cultural tourism, a field in which
Austria - and Vienna, in particular - is one of the world champions.
Officials at the Austrian National Tourist Office suspect that about
one-fifth of the 25.7m visitors who came to Austria last year had mainly
cultural pursuits in mind. Ms Evelyn Miksch at the Vienna Tourist Board says
that virtually every tourist who visits the city is coming for culture.
Whether it is for the music of the Vienna State Opera and the Vienna
Philharmonic Orchestra or for the treasures of its 80 museums or for the
architectural splendour of the Habsburg palaces, the city has something
splendid for virtually everyone.
Tourism, as one might expect, is extremely important to the economy of
Vienna, although not as important as for the country as a whole. While
tourism accounts for 8 per cent of the national product, it yields 6 per
cent of Vienna's output.
The main trends of the past few years have been surges in tourists from
Japan and from eastern Europe. The number of overnight stays in the city by
Japanese soared from 95,500 in 1981 to a peak of 318,000 in 1990, making
them the fourth largest national group of visitors, after Germans, Italians
and Americans. Numbers tumbled last year, however, because of fears arising
from the Gulf War and the unrest in Yugoslavia.
The Japanese, with their orderly ways and high spending tendencies, are
highly prized by the city's tourist operators, and it is no longer uncommon
to see theatre programmes, restaurant menus and official tours provided in
Japanese. Many hotels also provide Japanese television programmes.
Attitudes toward eastern European visitors are less enthusiastic. When the
borders with Czechoslovakia and Hungary opened in late 1989, there began a
period of flash floods of eastern European tourists. Usually on weekends,
this would take the form of caravans of rickety, exhaust-spewing coaches
roaring into the city early in the morning.
The visitors, who had spent the night in the coach to save the cost of a
hotel, poured into the streets, inspected the great imperial palaces and
other historic sites and then repaired to parks to eat sandwiches brought
with them. At dusk they got back in their coaches and left for home, having
spent hardly a schilling.
For most of them, it was a first opportunity to see a western city. And it
happened to be a city with which they had many historical and family
connections. The architecture of Vienna and even the imperial yellow colour
of much of it is the same as that found in the eastern countries that were,
until 1918, part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. Also, it is said that
nearly half the names in the Vienna telephone book are of Czechoslovak or
Hungarian origin.
'We have to be patient with them, and most people understand that,' Ms
Miksch says.
It must be said that the coach problem is not just restricted to those
coming from Hungary and Czechoslovakia. Most days in the summer, there are
hundreds of coaches from all over Europe trying to squeeze into small
parking lots at the city's most popular tourist sites.
Led by the Green party, many citizens would like to severely limit the
movement of coaches in the city, and ultimately banish them to depots on the
city outskirts.
'We are not hostile, but there are limits,' says Mr Christoph Chorherr, the
Greens' member on the Vienna City Council. 'All of our famous sites are
served by trams. We should build up our public transit service, with special
services for tourists.'
The tourist industry says many visitors are elderly and cannot be forced to
walk. But Mr Chorherr says they do in Venice and in the centre of Vienna
already, so they can do it elsewhere too.
With such a highly developed tourist industry, it is fair to ask if the city
is reaching its capacity limit. There are times of the year, notably around
new year and Easter, when the city is absolutely jammed with tourists, and
it becomes quite unpleasant, but tourist industry officials point out that
the average hotel occupancy rate is only 60 per cent.
The Vienna Tourist Office is trying to promote the idea of visiting the city
off-season. Ms Miksch agrees that first-time visitors should come during the
late spring or summer so they can walk around freely and get a feel for the
city. But anyone who is returning with a view to a serious study of a museum
or art collection would be better off doing it in January or February when
he is less likely to be distracted by crowds.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (4): Middleman keeps busy - Trading between east and
west
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN RODGER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHEN THE iron curtain was ripped apart in 1989, there was considerable
anxiety among business circles in Vienna.
This was because it was feared that the city would lose its special and
highly profitable role as a middleman in trading - often rather murky
trading - between east and west.
In the event, the fears were totally unfounded. The city has already become
a regional financial centre for central and eastern Europe and, along with
Berlin, is a preferred base for the hundreds of western companies seeking to
do business in eastern Europe.
Viennese business leaders are naturally cautious about proclaiming their
city a new international financial centre. 'We can never expect to compete
with London,' one banker says. But a lot is happening. The big Austrian
banks have all established - perhaps one should say re-established - offices
in eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union, and aggressively pursue all
kinds of financial business there.
The banks are also bringing trainees from these countries into Vienna to
learn the business.
'We regarded it as our extended home market,' an official of Creditanstalt,
the second largest bank and most aggressive in eastern Europe, says. The
bank now has offices in Prague, Budapest and Warsaw and has just acquired a
bank in Slovenia.
Creditanstalt even intends to offer retail banking in some of these
countries. 'We have advantages in eastern Europe, and for the moment there
is no other competition. The Germans look fully occupied for a long time,
and by the time they move in, we hope to be well established,' a bank
official says.
The big banks are also bringing eastern European businesses to Vienna to
raise capital. More than half the volume of Hungarian shares is traded in
Vienna. Mr Gerhard Randa, deputy chief executive of Bank Austria, the
country's largest bank, has proposed setting up a central European stock
exchange based in Vienna once exchanges are set up in a number of eastern
European cities.
He has also suggested the creation of a publicly financed know-how fund to
aid development of companies in eastern Europe.
Another element of Vienna's importance as a financial centre for the east
derives from Austria's bank secrecy laws. Switzerland has passed legislation
obliging banks to know their customers but Austria remains one of the few
hard currency countries in which anonymous numbered bank accounts are
permitted.
Until recently, Austrian banks have downplayed the significance of
international private banking in their strategies, but they are becoming
more excited about it amid indications that large private fortunes from
eastern Europe are moving into Vienna.
The other main contributors to Vienna's growth these days are western
multinational companies. 'We have had a boom ever since the old Comecon
countries opened,' Mr Friedrich Heitzinger, deputy managing director of the
Vienna Business Promotion Fund (WWFF), says.
The list of international companies that have set up bases in Vienna in
recent years runs from Sweden's Alfa-Laval to Yamaha of Japan, and continues
to lengthen. The WWFF claims to have helped 500 companies in all since its
formation 10 years ago. One banker claims that over 200 western companies
have set up liaison offices for doing business in eastern Europe in the past
two years.
Companies choose Vienna as a base for eastern European operations for
several reasons. For one thing, it has excellent and reliable transportation
and communication infrastructure. 'In Budapest, you have little chance of
getting a telephone these days,' a Viennese banker says.
For another, the city is very pleasant to live in, with good housing and
schools available. And office space is cheaper than in Budapest. The Vienna
city council keeps a bank of 3m square metres of various types of office and
industrial space available for newcomers.
Mr Heitzinger says some western companies have set up offices in eastern
European cities but then abandoned them in favour of Vienna because of the
practical difficulties of operating in the east.
As compared with other gateway cities, such as Berlin, Vienna also has the
advantage of strong historical and linguistic links with its neighbouring
countries. 'Many people here speak Czech or Hungarian, so we have no
difficulty finding good people,' says Mr Katsumi Ishibashi, manager of the
Bank of Tokyo's representative office in Vienna.
Japanese businesses have been particularly enthusiastic about Vienna, and
the city has been the beneficiary of their well-known tendency to move in
packs. 'Four years ago, there were only 30 Japanese companies with offices
in Vienna. Now there are nearly 100,' Mr Ishibashi says.
Mr Masahiko Murakami, assistant manager of the eastern European liaison
office of Matsushita Electrical Industrial in Vienna, says he appreciates
the ease of getting visas for Poland, Hungary and Czechoslovakia in Vienna.
'Even German companies set up here,' he observes.
Other industrialists point to the opportunity for their children to learn
German, which they feel will be more useful than learning an eastern
European language, as they would have to do if they were living in an
eastern European city.
Because of the expansion, Bank of Tokyo will next month upgrade its
20-year-old office in Vienna to branch status. There must be few other
Japanese banks expanding anywhere else in the world in these tough times.
It is not clear yet whether, once the eastern European countries have
reached a certain level of development, companies will set up offices there
and phase down their operations in Vienna. To an extent, some observers say,
this is happening already, with a few companies putting labour-intensive
operations into the east as quickly as possible to take advantage of low
wages.
However, Vienna should keep and enhance its importance as a base for
corporate services, such as legal, accounting and consulting services. H
Neumann International, the Vienna based executive search group, has just
established a co-ordinating office in the city for what it calls the new
Europe.
'I do not believe that the use of Vienna as a co-ordinating base will
drastically increase, but as a knowhow centre it will stay important,'

FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (3): Luring the local saver - Financial Markets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ERIC FREY

<TEXT>
IN VIENNA, the stock market sometimes appears to be closer to the tourist
scene than the banking industry. Austrians provide foreigners with a casual
and colourful setting and expect them to supply the funds. Most of the
locals, however, never set foot in the market.
The bourse, located in an opulent 19th century building that was nearly
gutted by a fire in the 1960s, was one of Europe's most sleepy backwaters
until 1985, when Barron's Mr Jim Rogers recommended Austrian shares to his
readers.
A few foreign investors, bidding up an illiquid market, sparked a powerful
boom, which fizzled out after a few exciting months. The cycle repeated
itself after the barriers with the eastern bloc came down in 1989, when
foreigners fell in love with Austrian shares and turned Vienna into Europe's
best-performing market. But the addiction to orders from abroad left Vienna
with a hangover when the euphoria faded.
While the effects of the Gulf War no longer have an impact on other major
markets, the war in Yugoslavia, which in its initial stage was also fought
on the Austrian border, has kept the Vienna bourse in the doldrums for
nearly two years. The major indices are now 40 per cent below their peak of
March 1990, and only slightly above the bourse's 1991 lows.
So the stock market scene has began to resemble Vienna's tourist highlights
also with its nostalgic mood. Traders and syndicate managers love to sit
around and talk about the good old days. The mood in the small trading room,
where about 100 issues change hands for only two hours a day, is quite
subdued these days.
With only a handful of blue chip stocks, none of them with a free float of
more than 50 per cent, the choice for investors is quite limited. Some of
the big publicly traded companies are foreign-owned, and many more are
majority-controlled by the federal government.
While Austria has taken some steps toward privatisation of its large
state-owned sector, the Social Democrats of Chancellor Franz Vranitzky still
resist a cut of the state's stakes in the biggest banks and industrial
companies below 50 per cent. Among the financial shares, the biggest single
sector in the market, 30 per cent of Creditanstalt's stocks and only 6.5 per
cent of Bank Austria are in public ownership.
The big banks, in turn, hold major stakes in many other companies. The new
issue market, which has remained dormant for more than a year, is unlikely
to enlarge the range of choices much. There is a flurry of new stock
offerings expected for the coming months, but most of them are small and
medium-size companies with little appeal to international investors.
Even the initial offering of Girozentrale, the country's third largest bank,
is expected to be small, and the timing is still undecided. The long-awaited
initial flotation of state-owned industrial giant Austrian Industries,
originally scheduled for this year, had to be postponed until 1993 because
of weak earnings at its steel and aluminium divisions, and most observers
expect further delays.
OMV, Austrian Industries' oil subsidiary with a 25 per cent free float, is
one of the market's most attractive issues. But over the past few weeks it
has seen a significant drop after reporting a loss for the first quarter.
A major drawback for the Vienna bourse is the weak interest of domestic
investors. 'Austria is a savers' nation, the savings rate is 14 per cent,
but people don't invest in stocks. The interest paid on savings accounts at
the end of the year can buy up the free float on the Vienna Stock Exchange,'
says Mr Michael Lielacher, general manager of the Vindobona Privat-Bank in
Vienna. Less than 4 per cent of the population own any equities, but bankers
say this is nearly a four-fold increase over the early 1980s.
Mr Peter Szobo, head of equity research at Girozentrale, says he expects a
further doubling of ownership over the next five years. 'There is no base of
institutional investors, but this is slowly getting better. Life insurance
companies and pension funds are diversifying their portfolios. It is just
not changing from one day to the next.'
The limited ownership cannot be explained by a lack of efforts. Various
privatisations in the past few years have been accompanied by a wave of
advertising. And to the surprise of television viewers, the state-owned
network ORF has begun to report trends on the Vienna and international stock
markets in its evening news.
Experts say a renewed bull market would do most to lure more domestic
investors to the bourse. They regard the high level of German interest
rates, which Austria is forced to match to keep the Schilling pegged to the
D-Mark, as the main obstacle to an upturn. So analysts in Vienna are closely
watching the trend in Austria's northern neighbour to forecast the fate of
the local market. Mr Lielacher says he expects a rally in Austrian shares
after German interest rate cuts in the middle of the year.
Vienna could easily outperform Frankfurt 'because we don't have to pay for
the takeover of a whole country,' he says. The market should also benefit
from an economic recovery in neighbouring Hungary and Czechoslovakia, where
Austrian companies have made large investments, he adds.
One of the surprising success stories in Vienna is the fledgling futures and
options market, OTOB, which started up last October. Using the Swedish OM
system, OTOB has launched trading in stock options with few hitches and by
February reached an average daily volume of 10,000 contracts in six stocks.
Mr Christian Imo, who left the Frankfurt options exchange (DTB) to head
OTOB, says the success reflects the need for a transparent and liquid
investment vehicle in Vienna. The bearish and volatile mood on the spot
market has also spurred demand for a good hedging instrument, he says.
In the summer, OTOB is planning to launch an option on the ATX, the new
real-time stock index which includes 18 blue chip shares. 'It will be the
first product that is really competitive in the international market,' Mr
Imo says. 'Investors will be able to buy the country risk without having to
investigate the whole market.'
The relationship between OTOB, which is jointly owned by Austria's banks,
and the Vienna stock market is one of polite co-existence, not co-operation,
observers say. Because the bourse insists on maintaining its official
monopoly in Austria, OTOB is not allowed to call itself a bourse. The
institution is registered as a bank.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Vienna (1): Crossroads of vitality - Eastern European
countries are rushing to build links to the prosperous west, so the city is
bubbling as the Habsburg Empire's historical bonds are recreated.
Immigration does cause concern, but the city desperately needs new blood
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
VIENNA SEEMS on the verge of another golden age.
The city, which was once at the centre of a vast empire, is once again
finding its place in the sun as eastern European countries rush to build
links to the more prosperous west.
For most of the postwar period, the former capital of the Holy Roman Empire
has ticked over very slowly, condemned to the political sidelines by its
treaties with east and west, and with little but its monuments and a growing
stream of tourists to remind it of former glory.
Today, Vienna bubbles with vitality, a crossroads again between east and
west, with the sounds of many tongues echoing in the squares around St
Stephen's Cathedral and the noise and bustle of construc- tion from an
ambitious urban renewal project, Donau-City, on the edge of the Danube.
The imperial triangle that once linked Vienna, Prague and Budapest in
commercial prosperity is being rebuilt, helped immensely by the historical
bonds implied in the often-heard phrase, 'imperial yellow'. That was the
dominant colour on the Habsburg architecture throughout the region, and it
symbolises the common heritage.
While too many other large cities have cracked under the strains of sudden
massive immigration in recent years, Vienna so far has taken it largely in
its stride. It remains one of the world's most peaceful and liveable, as
well as beautiful, cities - well-managed by a competent city government,
well cared for by its environmentally conscious residents and maintaining a
relatively modest cost of living.
There seems very little on the horizon that could undermine that quality of
life or the new sense of direction and excitement in Vienna. Foreign
businesses continue to flood in to use the city as a base for their
explorations of eastern Europe. Leading Viennese banks are scurrying to
capture for themselves their former strong position in finance in the
region.
Even the scheduled completion later this year, after more than 1,000 years
of efforts, of a canal connecting the Danube to the Rhine will boost the
city. Its harbour promises to be one of the busiest for transshipments along
the 3,000-kilometre waterway from Rotterdam to Ismail on the Black Sea.
Wiener Hafen, the company that operates the harbour, is planning to invest
Sch250m over the next four years to expand its services.
The political life of the city is approaching a milestone, as Mr Helmut
Zilk, the popular social democrat mayor, and Mr Hans Mayr, his deputy, are
expected to retire at the end of their current term in 1995. Some think they
may retire even sooner, but Mr Mayr denies it. 'I am not a prophet, but if
everything goes according to plan, we will continue to the end of our term.'
In last November's civic election, the Social Democratic party suffered
considerable setbacks, ending up with 52 out of 100 seats, the slimmest
majority it has had since coming to power in 1918. Mr Christoph Chorherr,
the young city councillor representing the Green party, says the culture of
politics is changing, but even he admits the city is run well.
Virtually the only concern one hears in the city is over public resentment
about immigrants. There is no doubt that the high levels of immigration from
eastern Europe in recent years have caused strains.
In the November elections, the charismatic Mr Jorg Haider, whom some accuse
of courting neo-Nazi sentiment, led his Freedom Party (FPOe) to more than
double its vote to 23 per cent. The party even displaced the conservative
Austrian People's Party (OeVP) in second place at city hall.
The result drew comment around the world to the effect that neo-Nazi
sentiment was on the rise, and that the Viennese were at least as intolerant
of immigrants as residents of some other western European cities.
But viewed from close up, that result now looks less disturbing than it did
at the time. For one thing, the OeVP had weak leadership and no programme to
offer, leaving not only the FPOe, but also the Greens, which entered city
hall for the first time, to capitalise on general discontent.
'I do not think it was the Haider factor,' Mr Mayr says. 'The irresponsible
discussion of immigrants in the city caused emotions to run high and that
hurt the other parties.'
The outcome of the first round of elections for the national presidency last
month suggests that things have calmed down a bit since last autumn. Mr Mayr
and others note that, for the first time in several years, the conservative
OeVP fielded a credible candidate, the diplomat Thomas Klestil. And Mr
Klestil obtained a respectable share of the vote, 31 per cent, among the
Viennese. Mr Haider's candidate, on the other hand, received only 14 per
cent.
In any event, the most encouraging thing about the immigration debate in
Vienna - and this is what differentiates it from similar debates in other
large cities - is that the city's political and business leaders from all
but the Haider end of the spectrum support immigration. And not just out of
a sense of duty or moral obligation. They enthusiastically welcome it.
Their view is that, for various reasons, Vienna desperately needs new blood.
For some, it is simply a matter of demographics. The city was actually in
decline before the iron curtain lifted. Now it is growing again. For others,
the energy brought by poor people willing to work hard for low wages is
providing a welcome jolt to a somnolent economy.
For still others, it is a matter of cultural vitality. 'The quality of
culture and science here has never recovered from the loss of the Jewish
upper middle class in the late 1930s,' one banker says.
Fortunately, the city has been admirably planned to absorb immigrants - at
least official immigrants - with a deliberate mix of middle and low-cost
housing in most districts. Mr Mayr, who is also responsible for Vienna's
finances, believes it can absorb between 15,000 and 20,000 new residents a
year, although he acknowledges a problem with several thousand more illegal
immigrants crammed into appalling ghetto-like conditions in a couple of city
districts.
The city government is in the process of doubling its own apartment
construction programme from 4,000 to 8,000 units a year, as well as
renovating an additional 4,000 units as part of its policy of revitalising
the inner city rather than developing satellites.
And this year, it has more than trebled its school construction budget to
Sch500m. Mr Mayr expects this spending to remain at a high level for about
five years, as will budgets for special language training and day care for
children of immigrants.
All this is being handled with no evidence of strain on the city's finances.
The city runs very modest deficits as a rule, last year about Sch2.3bn,
which was Sch5bn less than forecast. This year it is budgeting for a deficit
of Sch8.2bn on total planned spending of Sch104.4bn, but Mr Mayr will
probably manage to compress it as usual.
Privatisation is also in the air, with the city planning to reduce its stake
in Wiener Holding, a sprawling group with interests in hotels, cinemas,
theatres, restaurants, construction, pharmaceuticals, a trade fair and the
port of Vienna, by another 25 per cent later this year to 26 per cent.
Even the Green party, which won seven of the 100 seats at city hall last
November, admits that the city has few serious problems. 'We are a very rich
city and we have a population that is very sensitive to the environment.
That is a chance for us. We could be a model for the world,' says Mr
Chorherr.

FT  22 MAY 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOEL KIBAZO
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
STOCK index futures traded in a tight range in a quiet session devoid of
notable features, writes Joel Kibazo.
The June contract on the FT-SE opened at 2,729 and early light demand saw it
move ahead moderately to 2,730, which turned out to be the high of the day.
June drifted lower thereafter, though two-way business was noted at the
lower levels, helping to steady the contract.
The weak opening of Wall Street triggered a sizeable amount of selling,
sending June lower, and the contract, having traded between 2,700 and 2,728
for most of the session, closed at 2,718. This was down 16 on its previous
close and around 8 points above its estimated fair value premium to cash of
about 8. Turnover at the official close was just shy of 6,000 lots.
Further falls were recorded in after hours' trading, with the June contract
retreating to reach 2,706 at one stage.
In traded options, turnover was a healthy 32,606 lots, of which 10,007
contracts were traded in the FT-SE 100 option.
Asda was once again the top traded stock option as talk of a consortium
launching a bid for the food retailer again did the rounds. It traded 3,162
lots. This was followed by BT, which released full-year figures yesterday,
at 1,695 contracts. The August 360 puts were particularly busy.

FT  22 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Fiat's Polish venture lifts
Milan by 2.8%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ITALY enjoyed a recovery, but analysts were cautious about its duration
after the recent drop to 1992 lows, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN was boosted by mainly domestic buying of Fiat shares after the car
company's announcement of a Dollars 2bn joint venture with the Polish
carmaker FSM. Other industrial recovery plays, such as Olivetti, Montedison
and Pirelli, were also in demand. The Comit index rose 13.4 or 2.8 per cent
to 488.41 in relatively heavy turnover of more than L120bn after L95bn.
Fiat jumped L277 or 5.6 per cent to close at L5,237 and reached L5,285 after
hours. Analysts said the share was benefiting from a change of sentiment in
the market as well as signs of a recovery in its domestic market. These
factors made the share a 'trading buy' and could push the share back up to
L6,000, they said.
However, they warned that the fundamental outlook for Fiat was still cloudy:
the Polish car production agreement amounted to little more than trying to
expand the profit margin on its smaller models and did not address the
company's weakness in Europe's larger car market; there was continued
difficulty in the farm equipment sector; and Fiat's ordinary shares already
looked expensive, trading on a 1993 price/earnings ratio of 13, compared to
9 for VW and 4 for Peugeot.
The strength in industrials spilled over to the banking sector, as San Paolo
rose L100 to L10,850 and Banca Commerciale Italiana added L105 to L3,100.
FRANKFURT became a market of stocks again, after sector strength on Monday -
carmakers, engineers and retailers following the settlement of the
metalworkers' pay talks - and Wednesday's general upsurge on optimism about
the German economy.
The FAZ index rose 1.89 to 719.29 while the DAX fell 2.02 to 1,785.48.
Volume fell to DM9bn from DM9.9bn.
Volkswagen dropped DM6.50 to DM397.50. County NatWest wrote yesterday that
VW had given guarantees to finance subsidiaries which, in conjunction with
other positions, had lifted contingencies and commitments by 68 per cent to
DM7.8bn; a rights issue, said County, was in immediate prospect.
Among second liners Lufthansa fell another DM5 to DM133.50, while Wella rose
another DM15.50 to DM644.50 for a gain of DM49.50 this week. The airline
delivered poor results a week ago and has fallen 11.4 per cent since then.
Wella, the hair cosmetics producer, said at its balance sheet press
conference on Tuesday that high provisions, interest charges and losses on
new product launches should all be reduced in the current year.
PARIS eased on the last day of the May account as investors locked into
their profits. The CAC-40 index ended 14.01 lower at 2,016.83 on volume of
about FFr2.6bn.
Sunny weather and arbitrage between the shares and the convertibles pushed
Euro Disney up by FFr2 to FFr127. But Eurotunnel eased FFr1.40 or 3.7 per
cent to FFr36.85 in a late reaction to the previous day's news that its
bankers might withdraw funding unless the company settles a dispute with TML
by August.
Chargeurs added FFr10 to FFr1,280 after a positive analysts' meeting and
optimism about BSkyB. But Havas dropped FFr7 to FFr535 after the company
told analysts that advertising revenue would be flat this year.
Perrier, which is being taken over by Nestle and Banque Indosuez, was
suspended at FFr1,701 as the bidders offered to buy out the remaining
minority shareholders, thereby de-listing the shares.
STOCKHOLM continued to be dominated by Astra, turnover in which amounted to
SKr150m of total turnover of SKr731m. Astra B unrestricted shares added SKr2
to SKr549, after a jump of SKr19 the previous day, following its positive
first quarter results. The Affarsvarlden General index rose 1.8 to 1001.1.
Trading was also heavy in Volvo as it B unrestricted share recovered SKr1 to
SKr424.
The banking index fell 1.6 per cent as investors worried about credit losses
following a bankruptcy petition filed by a small real estate group.
AMSTERDAM eased with the CBS Tendency index closing down 0.2 at 130.0.
Akzo and DSM both weakened by Fl 1 and 90 cents respectively to Fl 160 and
Fl 115.40. Fokker, a possible takeover target, lost 50 cents to Fl 35.10.
Elsevier shed 90 cents to Fl 112.80: at a presentation in London yesterday
the publisher forecast strong earnings growth for the rest of the year.
BRUSSELS saw active trading on the first day of the new forward account,
although dividend payments by a number of blue chips pushed the index lower.
The Bel-20 index lost 10.33 to 1,213.86. Petrofina, paying a dividend of
BFr421 a share, closed at BFr10,900 for a net loss of BFr79.
MADRID's general index rose 0.57 to 260.45 with Endesa up Pta50 to Pta3,770
on news that it had signed a cooperation pact with RWE of Germany.

FT  22 MAY 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei remains resilient
in arbitrage-led trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMIKO TERAZONO
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SCATTERED buying propped up share prices yesterday as investors remained
inactive ahead of the earnings results of leading companies, writes Emiko
Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average gained 16.36 to 18,691.29 after a day's low of
18,552.99 and high of 18,760.74. Trading was slow due to a lack of corporate
news, with arbitrage-related activity leading price movements.
Volume shrank to 270m shares from 320m. Declines led rises by 583 to 409,
with 149 issues unchanged. The Topix index of all first section stocks lost
3.19 to 1,391.32, and in London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index was 0.18 up at
1,103.76.
Traders said prices were showing resilience in spite of the lethargic
activity. A trader at Baring Securities said sentiment had turned as
investors felt that prices had bottomed out. 'A month ago, the market would
have fallen 600 points on a trading day like this,' he added.
However, most market participants believe that the current resistance level
of the Nikkei is at 19,000, and some are looking to sell once the index
rises to that point.
Dealers continued to target speculative issues on short-term trading.
Mitsubishi Kakoki, the most active stock of the day, fell Y60 to Y1,130 on
profit-taking. Ebara, the industrial pump maker, was sought as an
environmental share, gaining Y20 to Y1,560.
Isuzu Motors advanced Y15 to Y310 on rumours that a leading US car maker was
increasing its stake in the company.
Sankyu, a transport company, climbed Y13 to Y563 on a strong earnings
outlook. Sega Enterprises, the video game maker, put on Y100 to Y10,300
after reporting a two-fold rise in pre-tax profits for the last fiscal year
to Y33.5bn. The market was also heartened by its forecast of a 30 per cent
increase in pre-tax profits for the current year to March.
Leading consumer electronics groups were weaker. Matsushita Electric
Industrial, which posted a 39 per cent fall in consolidated pre-tax profits
to Y363.4bn, was off Y10 at Y1,370. Sony, which saw a pre-tax profits drop
of 44 per cent, slipped Y50 to Y4,310.
In Osaka, the OSE average shed 96.30 to 21,251.85 in volume of 15.3m shares.
Small-lot profit-taking depressed Ono Pharmaceutical by Y110 to Y6,200, and
Nintendo, the video game manufacturer, dipped Y100 to Y11,400.
Roundup
STRONG exceptions in a generally easier Pacific Basin region were provided
by Hong Kong and Bangkok.
HONG KONG soared to a record high in heavy trading, buoyed by lower
interbank rates and an influx of capital from Thailand. The Hang Seng index
shot up 111.85 to 5,865.61 as turnover swelled to HKDollars 4.6bn from
HKDollars 3.9bn.
Property counters were the star performers. Hong Kong Land advanced 30 cents
to HKDollars 11.90 and New World 40 cents to HKDollars 18.50.
BANGKOK closed sharply higher as investors were reassured by the
intervention of the king in the political situation, and by the relative
calm following the days of civil unrest. The SET index surged 60.30, or 9
per cent, to 738.67 as turnover reached Bt4.8bn, against Bt4.7bn. Many blue
chips rose by their 10 per cent daily limit.
AUSTRALIA focused on a weak banking sector, which tumbled after news late on
Wednesday that Westpac had made a loss of ADollars 1.7bn in its fiscal first
half, when analysts had expected a small profit. It ended down 17 cents at
ADollars 3.72, after a day's low of ADollars 3.58.
The All Ordinaries index was a slight 0.6 up at 1,682.6 in turnover of
ADollars 309m.
NEW ZEALAND fell on concern over how Australia would perform after the
Westpac news. The NZSE-40 capital index moved in a narrow range before
closing 0.34 down at 1,547.09. Turnover jumped to NZDollars 36.3m from
NZDollars 19.4m.
SINGAPORE declined in quiet trading. The Straits Times Industrial index lost
5.06 to 1,467.81 in SDollars 96.6m turnover.
MANILA closed at a 1992 peak. The composite index advanced 18.60 to 1,376.80
in turnover of 156m pesos. PLDT rose 20 pesos to 1,110 pesos.
SEOUL lost early gains as sentiment turned negative. The composite index was
down 6.08 at 573.83.
KUALA LUMPUR finished softer in light trading after an early attempt to add
to Wednesday's gains failed. The composite index shed 1.23 to 592.86.
TAIWAN's weighted index rose 3.67 to 4,563.67 in turnover of TDollars
35.8bn, after TDollars 30.1bn.

WORLD coarse grain production, which is expected to fall to less than 800m
tonnes this year from 829.9m tonnes in 1990, is expected to recover in the
1992-93 season, according to the International Wheat Council.
The IWC's latest report gives a first estimate for the 1992-93 coarse grain
harvest of 825m tonnes, an increase over this season of 27m tonnes. This
season's low harvest is attributed to dry weather conditions in many growing
areas.
The largest increases are expected in the US, up 30m to 249m tonnes, and the
former Soviet Union, up just over 10m to 92.8m tonnes. However, The IWC
warns that the former Soviet Union's harvest could end up being affected by
shortages of fuel, quality seeds, fertilisers, pesticides and spare parts
for agricultural machinery.
Consumption is estimated at 820m tonnes, little changed from the previous
two years. Consumption in developing countries is expected to increase
slightly.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Australian sugar may lose its
sweetener - Kevin Brown on the bitter debate over plans to abolish tariff
protection for the industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEVIN BROWN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHY DOES a highly efficient industry which exports nearly 80 per cent of
production need tariff protection against import competition? And why does
the industry resist the reduction of strict government control when the
evidence shows it would benefit from deregulation?
These questions are at the heart of a bitter debate raging in Australia over
the future of the Queensland-based sugar industry, the country's fourth
largest agricultural producer after wool, wheat and beef.
The tariff debate dates back to the federation of Australia's six British
colonies in 1901. Queensland won protection for its sugar producers in
return for accepting a whites-only immigration policy which required the
repatriation of low-wage Melanesian cane cutters.
The initial limited protection eventually grew into an embargo on sugar
imports which lasted until 1989, when the federal Labor government finally
included the industry in its general tariff reduction programme.
Against strong opposition from growers, the government replaced the embargo
with an ADollars 115 per tonne levy on imports, which fell to ADollars 76
last year, and will fall to ADollars 55 in July.
However, the government did nothing to reduce the tight control exercised by
the Queensland government, which restricts the supply of land, sets
production and milling quotas, and is the monopoly purchaser of raw bulk
sugar.
Against that background, there was outrage among growers earlier this month
when the Industry Commission, a government advisory body, recommended the
immediate abolition of both tariff protection and regulation.
The commission said there was no justification for the tariff, which
increases the profitability of sugar producers at the expense of downstream
users and consumers. It also claimed the Queensland regulations were
responsible for lost production worth hundreds of millions of dollars.
The report was sympathetically received by Mr John Dawkins, the federal
Treasurer (finance minister), a supporter of the general tariff reform
programme implemented in the mid-1980s by Mr Paul Keating, now Prime
Minister.
However, it was angrily rejected by Queensland's Labor government,
indicating that the issue had the potential to provoke a damaging split in
the run up to the next federal election, due by mid-1993.
The federal government headed off the political danger last week by
appointing Mr Brian Courtice, a Queensland sugar grower, to chair an inquiry
into the Industry Commission's recommendations. The effect will be to delay
a decision until after the election. However, the establishment of a second
inquiry merely underlines the difficulty of dealing with the Industry
Commission's argument that the structure of sugar growing damages both the
industry and the wider Australian economy.
No one disputes that the sugar growers are highly efficient, partly because
Australia's tropical regions have a natural comparative advantage, and
partly because high wage costs have encouraged technological innovation.
As a result, the industry has increased exports from 153,000 tonnes in 1946
to 2.8m tonnes in 1990, worth nearly ADollars 1bn. Total production has
risen over the same period from 677,000 tonnes to 3.7m tonnes.
However, the commission argues that the industry's ability to compete
profitably in the world market shows it does not need protection in its home
market. Removing the tariff would cut the cost of sugar to user industries,
and increase the potential for the development of export refining and other
downstream industries.
The commission also concludes that Queensland's regulatory system prevents
Australia from reaping the full benefits of the farmers' efficiency by
artificially restricting production. All but 400 of Australia's 5,000 cane
farmers are in Queensland.
This view is supported by Mr Brent Borrell, chief market economist at the
Centre for International Economics (CIE) in Canberra, who says the
regulations reduce gross domestic product by about ADollars 200m a year. A
CIE report on the industry* suggests that the chief constraint is the
Queensland land assignment system, under which the state government
specifies the amount and location of land to be used for sugar production.
The system is intended to match production to forecast supply. Historically,
however, increases in available land have usually followed periods of high
prices and coincided with periods of falling demand.
Queensland recently responded to criticism of the system by guaranteeing an
increase of 2.5 per cent per year in assigned land. But the CIE report says
land use would expand by 7.9 per cent a year if controls were lifted -
providing additional net income of ADollars 1.1bn over 15 years.
The report also forecasts that land prices would increase as farmers
switched from beef production to more profitable sugar cropping, that
incomes in sugar growing areas would rise, and that up to 140,000 jobs could
be created in the long term, many in the sugar industry.
None of this impresses the Queensland Sugar Corporation, which claims that
both the costs of tariffs and regulation and the benefits of abolition have
been overstated.
Mr Ian Ballantyne, general manager of the Australian Cane Growers
Association, says growers need tariff protection because the high cost of
transport in Australia puts them at a disadvantage in large parts of the
home market.
He also argues that the regulatory system acts as a buffer between the
growers and the market, and helps to keep production and milling capacity in
balance. The Industry Commission, he says, is advised by free market
economists (known in Australia as economic rationalists) who have failed to
understand the industry.
'The most disturbing thing about the Industry Commission process has been
that the (sugar) industry's submissions have gone very largely unheeded, and
they have been very selective about the data they have been willing to take
on board.
'The commission has in the past had a very economic rationalist view, and I
don't think their report represents a very credible attempt to deal with the
industry's problems,' he says.
However, the commission suggests other reasons for the industry's uncritical
support of regulation. It says the rules protect farmers from competition by
restricting entry into the industry and discouraging the amalgamation of
farms that has taken place in other rural industries.
The regulations also protect producers from the need to respond to changes
in market conditions, market their own sugar, and develop expertise in risk
management through hedging and other financial instruments.
'The comparison I would draw is with the wool industry, which was also
highly regulated and got in an awful mess,' says Mr Borrell. 'By contrast,
the cotton industry, which has never been regulated, attracts some of the
smartest farmers around.
'But even in the sugar industry the penny will drop and change will come
eventually. This sort of thing just cannot go on for ever.'

RUBBER prices are poised for upturn on the back of increased demand, even
though turmoil in the world's top grower Thailand has failed to spark a
rally, an International Natural Rubber Organisation (INRO) official said,
Reuter reports from Kuala Lumpur.
'I expect a gradual improvement in prices in the second half of this year,'
said buffer stock manager Mr Aldo Hofmeister. 'Prices could rise by 10 per
cent by the end of the year from current levels due to increase in offtake.'
'But there is very little (market) reaction to developments in Thailand and
that is surprising,' he said. The INRO uses a buffer stock mechanism to
stabilise prices.
Prices in Singapore and other major markets inched up marginally on Monday
and Tuesday on fears of reduced Thai supplies. But prices eased in Singapore
yesterday.

<TEXT>
EXPORTS of Brazilian orange juice and derivatives should reach Dollars 1.4bn
for the 1991-92 harvest season, based on preliminary figures for the first
10 months of the July-June cycle, according to the Association of Brazilian
Citrus Exporters (Abicitrus).
That figure would represent a 37.5 per cent increase over the previous
season's receipts.
Through the end of April, Brazilian exports of 798,000 tonnes had generated
sales of Dollars 1.2bn. Overall export receipts for 1990-91 were Dollars
1.0bn.
Better prices and sales of stocks are responsible for the improvement, said
Mr Ademerval Garcia, Abicitrus president. Production, he said, is about the
same as last season.
The average price in 1991 was Dollars 900 per tonne/fob. This year, the
average is Dollars 1,186 per tonne/fob. Carry over last season was 336,000
tonnes, compared to 157,000 this season.
Brazilian exporters are eyeing Japan with more interest, since it eliminated
its import quotas for orange juice. Currently, 4 per cent of Brazilian
exports are shipped to Japan, compared to 48.5 per cent to the European
Community.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: India to harvest smaller jute
crop
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   CALCUTTA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
BESET BY unfavourable weather in all jute growing areas, India will be
harvesting a lower jute crop of around 6.5m bales of 180kg each in the
season beginning July, against 9.2m bales in 1991-92 and 9m bales in
1990-91.
However, the Indian Jute Mills Association (IJMA) is more concerned that the
high quality jute needed for producing fine yarn, hessian and carpet backing
cloth will be in acute short supply. Jute mills producing these high value
items will be required to import superior grades of fibre which are expected
to command a handsome premium in the world market, according to trade
sources.
The Jute Balers Association (JBA) says that farmers in the traditionally
early sown areas of Assam and north Bengal had to postpone the sowing of
jute seeds by more than a month because of hot dry weather and no rainfall.
It is estimated that there is a shortfall of more than 30 per cent in the
area under jute in Assam and north Bengal.
The situation in Bihar, another area which comes under the early sown zone,
is even grimmer. The JBA survey finds that the progress in sowing is 'highly
disappointing' in all jute growing areas of Bihar which have hardly received
any rains.
The fate of the crop in terms of quantity as well as quality is decided at
south Bengal, which accounts for nearly 50 per cent of the country's raw
jute production. Here also hot dry weather has hindered the progress of
sowing.
Since the sowing has been delayed, the new crop will start arriving in the
market two months behind schedule. Yet as industry and trade sources point
out, the late crop arrival will not have much of an impact on raw jute
prices. This is because the 1992-93 jute season will be opening in July with
fibre stocks of around 3m bales, against the earlier projected 1.7m bales.

FT  22 MAY 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Climate changes may cut cereal
production
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Climate change could cut world cereal production by between 1 and 7 and per
cent and put up to 360m extra people at risk of hunger in the next century,
a scientific study has found.
The largest reductions in staple crop yields, of 9 to 11 per cent, would
occur in developing countries, while developed countries at higher latitudes
might increase yields. Reduced supply could lead to price rises of 25-150
per cent.
Slower population growth and a number of other measures, such as full trade
liberalisation, adaptation of agricultural practices and faster economic
growth, could mitigate but not neutralise the effects, and the impact on
developing countries could still be severe.
The three-year project by 50 scientists around the world investigated the
effect of three global warming scenarios of varying severity on yields of
wheat, rice, maize and soya, and on world food prices, using computer models
to make projections up to the year 2060.
The study was commissioned by the US Environmental Protection Agency and
jointly managed by the Oxford University Environmental Change Unit and
Goddard Institute for Space Studies.
Copies of the report will be circulated to delegates attending the Earth
Summit in Rio next month.
Current environmental policies were taken into account, but proposed
restrictions on the emission of greenhouse gases were not.
The study also assumed benefits from the direct effects of increased levels
of carbon dioxide, which in experiments have been found to increase plant
growth. But it is not known whether these benefits would be fully realised
outside experimental conditions.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Matsushita set to launch
Dollars 1bn global bond offering

<TEXT>
MATSUSHITA Electric Industrial, the world's largest consumer electronics
maker, will launch a Dollars 1bn global bond offering in July.
The issue will be the first global offering by a private company, and will
be launched on US and European markets. Matsushita will use the funds raised
to repay part of the debt related to the acquisition of MCA, the US film
company.
Matsushita's decision comes at a time when an increasing number of Japanese
companies are dipping into the straight bond markets. Equity-linked
financing has virtually halted due to the prolonged slump of the Tokyo stock
market.
Japanese banks are reluctant to increase aggressively its loan balances due
to capital adequacy standards set by the Basle committee of central bank
regulators, which must be met by the end of March next year.
The company's announcement follows the Dollars 1bn Eurobond issue by Toyota
Motor, the Japanese automobile group, launched on Wednesday. Toyota is one
of several Japanese companies which must refinance maturing equity-linked
bonds issued at the height of the Tokyo stock market boom in the late 1980s.
During the last fiscal year to March, domestic corporate bond issues by
Japanese companies rose 3.3 times from two years ago to Y2,426.7bn, while
overseas issues increased by 3.5 times to Y3,877.1bn.
Matsushita said it was not concerned about oversupply, since investors
remained keen to buy triple-A rated paper. The company reckoned that there
was large demand from investors wanting an exposure to Japanese blue chip
companies, but wary of equity investment against the background of the weak
Tokyo market.
Matsushita said the maturity of the issue would be 7 to 10 years. It said
soundings of interest among investors would begin as soon as registration
procedures with the US Securities and Exchange Commission were completed.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Capital Markets: Warrants issued on Brazilian
bank debt
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SIMON LONDON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PARIBAS Capital Markets yesterday launched the first warrants on Brazilian
bank debt, underlining increased interest among investors in Latin American
'distressed' loans.
The warrants offer investors the right to buy Brazilian 'multi-year deposit
facility agreement' (MYDFA) debt at 40 per cent of face value over the next
year.
The loans are already traded actively between banks and were yesterday
quoted at around this level in the secondary market.
However, the secondary market price of the loans has risen this year as
Brazil has worked towards a debt restructuring agreement with its commercial
creditors.
If the country can agree a Brady-style debt restructuring similar to Mexico
and Venezuela - under which loans are converted into collateralised bonds -
the warrants will give the holders the right to buy Brady bonds.
Paribas said that the warrants, which cover loans with a face value of
Dollars 100m, were bought by retail and institutional investors looking for
geared exposure to Brazil's improving credit standing in the investment
community.
Earlier this month, JP Morgan launched a Dollars 100m warrant issue on
Argentina's bank debt, offering the right to buy either loans or Brady bonds
at 41.5 per cent of face value.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Bonds: Strong demand for US dollar-denominated
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SARA WEBB
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE INTERNATIONAL bond market witnessed further strong demand for US
dollar-denominated issues yesterday, as the Province of British Columbia
launched a successful Dollars 500m deal close on the heels of large dollar
issues from the Province of Ontario and Toyota.
In addition, two borrowers tapped the Eurosterling sector - an area which
has been almost devoid of new issues in recent months, while a handful of
Latin American borrowers launched issues aimed at investors in search of
high-yielding paper.
British Columbia's 10-year bond carries a coupon of 7 3/4 per cent and was
priced at 98.61 to yield 48 basis points over the ten-year US Treasury bond.
The yield spread narrowed to 46 basis points, and syndicate managers
generally agreed that the pricing was 'sensible'.
The issue was well-received - despite the weakness in the US Treasury bond
market overnight - and about half the issue was sold to European
institutions, with the rest split between the Far East and US.
British Columbia has a AA1 rating from Moody's Investors Service. The bond
issue is part of the Province's CDollars 4.7bn general funding programme:
including this issue, it will have completed CDollars 2.2bn of the funding
programme in the first two months of its financial year, according to
Deutsche Bank Capital Markets, the lead manager.
The European Investment Bank and BP America both chose to launch
medium-sized Eurosterling issues, a sector of the market which has seen few
new deals largely due to the lack of attractive swap opportunities.
The EIB's Pounds 200m 10-year bond with a coupon of 9 per cent is fungible
with an existing Pounds 200m issue. Samuel Montagu, the lead manager, said
the borrower decided to tap the sterling market again because its existing
issue was becoming illiquid. According to the lead manager, the existing
paper has been yielding between 10-15 basis points less than the 10-year
gilt, and the new tranche was priced to yield 5 basis points below the gilt.
The deal is intended to attract investors interested in sterling assets
rather than a 'spread play'. Samuel Montagu said some continental investors
prefer such paper to gilts, especially if they cannot receive their coupons
gross on the comparable UK government bonds.
The issue, which was launched at 99.403, traded at 99.45-99.55 later in the
day, yielding between 7-8 basis points below the 10-year gilt. The deal was
not swapped and constitutes funding for the EIB to lend out.
BP America increased its initial Pounds 100m issue to Pounds 125m as the
deal was fairly well received, dealers said. The six-year bond, which has a
coupon of 9 1/2 per cent, was reoffered at 99.125, and traded at
99.125-99.18 later in the day, according to lead manager Hambros Bank. The
issue was swapped out of sterling.
Investor interest came mainly from Germany and Switzerland. The deal was
priced to yield 40 basis points over the six-year gilt and the spread
narrowed to 37.5 basis points over.
Investors in search of high-yielding paper witnessed a flood of Latin
American issues yesterday, with bonds launched by Pemex (the Mexican oil
group) and Aerovias De Mexico (the airline), as well as Bariven, a
wholly-owned subsidiary of Petroleos De Venezuela.
The two-year FFr500m issue from Pemex yielded 180 basis points over the
two-year BTAN and was swapped into dollars. Paribas, the lead manager,
reported strong demand for short-dated, high-yielding French franc paper.
Such issues appeal both to so-called 'flight capital' investors (Latin
American investors with offshore assets who want the anonymity of bearer
bonds) and to European retail investors in search of high-yielding paper.
Meanwhile, Aerovias De Mexico's Dollars 100m issue was priced to yield 437
basis points over three-year US Treasury bonds.

   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HAVAS, a leading player in French media and tourism, should return to
profits growth this year after sustaining a fall in profits in 1991
according to Mr Pierre Dauzier, president.
Mr Dauzier yesterday told an analysts' meeting in Paris that the group was
on course for net profits of FFr1.2bn (Dollars 226m) in 1992. That would
represent an increase of 10.8 per cent upon 1991 when profits slipped by
slightly more than 6 per cent.
Last year Havas was hit by the slowdown in the French advertising industry
(where it is the dominant player as a result of its holding in the Eurocom
group) and also by losses from its travel interests. The advertising
slowdown also affected the performance of its free newspaper businesses.
Mr Dauzier forecast static sales of FFr26.5bn for the group this year. He
said he did not envisage a strong recovery in the advertising market this
year, but did expect to see a modest improvement. In the coming years Havas
is expected to increase the proportion of sales generated outside France
from 30 per cent in 1991 to 50 per cent in 1995.
Lyonnaise des Eaux, the French utilities and industrial group, may reduce
its 3.8 per cent holding in Havas, according to Mr Dauzier, who said he
would look 'favourably' on the arrival of a new foreign partner as an equity
investor. He saw this as a way of forging closer business links with
international partners.
Mr Dauzier confirmed that Havas planned to press ahead with a FFr1.8bn
capital increase in mid-July to raise funds to continue its expansion in
Europe.
Perrier, the French mineral water company, saw its shares suspended in Paris
yesterday while Nestle of Switzerland and Banque Indosuez of France, which
are approaching the end of a fiercely-fought joint bid for the company,
finalised details of a forthcoming offer to buy out Perrier's minority
shareholders with the stock market authorities.

WINTERTHUR, the Swiss insurance group, reports an 11 per cent rise in net
income for 1991 to SFr262.9m (Dollars 180m), thanks to strong contributions
from Swiss non-life business and North American direct business.
The directors have recommended a 3 per cent rise in dividends to SFr70 per
registered share and SFr14 per participation certificate. They have also
decided to accept non Swiss holders of registered shares on the register.
Gross premiums jumped 17 per cent to SFr14.6bn with nearly 3 per cent of it
coming from currency conversion. Investment income was up 15.4 per cent to
SFr40.5bn.
Winterthur Life, the group's largest subsidiary, raised its premium income
by 20 per cent to SFr4.26bn. Overseas branches had premium growth of more
than 40 per cent, mainly because the company took on some important group
insurance contracts in Belgium and Spain.
Winterthur Life made an operating profit of SFr650m; 50 per cent higher than
in the previous year. More than 97 per cent of it was allocated to the bonus
fund. Investment income was up 17.2 per cent to SFr1.47bn and net income
ended up at SFr16.8m, up 7.7 per cent.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: National Australia Bank net
profits ahead at midterm

NATIONAL Australia Bank, one of Australia's four major national trading
banks, has reversed two years of falling earnings to achieve a 12.3 per cent
increase in net profits to ADollars 405.6m (USDollars 307.2m) for the six
months ended March, 1992.
The Melbourne-based group, which is holding its interim dividend at 22 cents
a share, says doubtful debt charges fell from ADollars 455.7m to ADollars
412.6m.
Mr Don Argus managing director, points to 'some tentative signs of economic
recovery'.
National's report was in marked contrast to Wednesday's half-year results
from Westpac, Australia's biggest trading bank, which declared a ADollars
1.67bn loss following huge property portfolio write-offs.
The major point of contrast was the performance of the two banks' finance
offshoots. National's Custom Credit turned a ADollars 68.7m loss into a
ADollars 6.4m profit, but Westpac's Australian Guarantee Corporation
incurred a ADollars 719m loss, mainly as a result of property exposure.
National's UK and Irish banking operations acted as the main brake on
earnings with a contribution declining by almost 28 per cent to ADollars
120.1m. The operations include the Clydesdale, Northern Yorkshire and
National Irish groups.
National's Australian trading and savings banks incurred a modest 0.3 per
cent earnings fall to ADollars 279.8m following a 3.1 per cent rise in bad
loan charges to ADollars 212.1m.
The UK and Irish banks bore the brunt of the bad loans with write-offs
rising from ADollars 97.5m to ADollars 201.4m. The biggest contributor was
Yorkshire Bank where charges jumped from ADollars 62.9m to ADollars 156.2m.
The most tangible sign of pessimism in National's result was an increase in
problem loan provisions from ADollars 3.86bn to ADollars 4.25bn on the
widest definition.
But Mr Argus did address the matter of property valuations in the wake of
the Westpac shock. He said the continued decline in property values in
Australia remained a major influence on the group's provisioning and
write-offs.
Mr Argus indicated that National's Tier 1 capital ratio stood at 7.9 per
cent at March, against a reserve bank minimum requirement of 4 per cent.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: PTT Telecom joins data network
venture

<TEXT>
PTT Telecom, the Dutch telecommunications company, has joined forces with
AMR, parent company of American Airlines, and CSX, the US transportation
company, to develop and sell an electronic data network in Europe.
The network will enable manufacturers, shipping lines and freight forwarders
to keep track of cargo shipments as they move from factory to customer.
Mr Robert Crandall, chairman of American Airlines, said the venture with PTT
Telecom was the first of a planned series of regional partnerships around
the world aimed at providing companies with transport logistics information.
AMR and CSX announced last month they had formed an initial partnership,
called Encompass, to promote the logistics information system.
The system aims to allow global trading partners to communicate
electronically, regardless of the type of computer systems they use
internally, or where they are based. Mr John Snow, head of CSX, has
estimated the potential market for products such as Encompass at around
Dollars 1.6bn.
PTT Telecom will take a 35 per cent stake in the new joint venture,
Encompass Europe, and invest Fl 50m (Dollars 27.8m) in the project.
AMR and CSX, owner of the Sealand shipping line and one of the largest
railroad operators in the US, will hold the remaining 65 per cent via the
Encompass partnership.
The two US companies have invested Dollars 40m in developing the transport
logistics concept over the past few years.
The principle aim of the Encompass system is to help cut inventory and other
costs for manufacturers as well as reduce the amount of paperwork for
hauliers. 'It sometimes seems to us that there's more paper than freight,'
Mr Crandall said.
The system is being tested in the US by multinational corporations such as
Digital Equipment, the computer company, and Procter and Gamble, the
consumer products group, which is using the electronic network to monitor
shipments between the US east coast and the Far East.
Encompass Europe, to be based in Rotterdam, claims to be the first
electronic data interchange system for the transport industry which spans
the various 'modes' of transport.
After Europe, Encompass's next priority is to find an equity partner in the
US similar to PTT Telecom for the North and South American markets. In Asia,
it will probably seek several different partners.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: French call for rigour in
company reports
</HEADLINE>

<DATELINE>
   PARIS
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FRENCH companies should be more rigorous in their reporting of financial
information according to the Commission des Operations de Bourse (COB), the
watchdog for the French stock market.
In its 1991 annual report, which was published yesterday, the COB criticised
French companies for inaccuracies and irregularities in their presentation
of financial information. It also alleged that some companies did not
disclose enough information in their annual reports. The COB's call for more
rigorous reporting - an issue which is often commented on within the French
financial community - comes at a time when the French government is engaged
in a series of reforms intended to complete the modernisation of France's
financial markets.
Earlier this spring the government announced its intention to abolish the
right to make 'partial' bids for only 66 per cent of a company's equity.
Meanwhile, the stock market authorities are finalising plans to make block
trading - transactions involving large numbers of shares - easier in Paris.
These changes coincide with the wider reforms of the socialist government's
partial privatisation programme and its plans for pension reform. Mr Pierre
Beregovoy, France's long-serving finance minister who recently became prime
minister, is seen as a prime mover behind these changes.
Mr Jean Saint-Geours, president of the COB, used its 1991 annual report to
stress the need for scrupulous standards among French companies. He said the
current difficulties could 'increase the temptation for companies to confuse
fiction with fact and to mislead the public'. He cited four companies -
Sedri, Concept, SMT Goupil and Asystel - which had released misleading or
inaccurate information. Two years ago the COB was empowered to initiate
legal proceedings against such companies.

Mr Bronfman was replying to Vancouver Greenpeace campaigner Mr John Mate,

In a presentation at the Seagram annual meeting, Mr Mate claimed the

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ASTRA International, Indonesia's second largest conglomerate, has confirmed
that the Soeryadjaya family, which has a 76 per cent stake in the company,
is to sell part of their holding.
Bankers say the sale is required for the family to support the troubled,
privately owned Bank Summa in which they are majority shareholders.
Astra accounts for over half of Indonesia's vehicle sales and has
distribution rights for Toyota, Peugeot, Isuzu, BMW and Renault.
Vehicle sales have dropped by 40 per cent against 1990, brokers say, and
profits are forecast to fall by 15-20 per cent this year from Rp210bn
(Dollars 103m) in 1991. Bank Summa has suffered from customers defaulting on
car purchase loans, as well as a fall in the prop-erty development market.
Its shareholders have recently injected Rp300bn in new capital and Summa is
discussing a possible merger with Bank Danamon, Indonesia's second largest
private bank, which has reportedly provided Summa a Rp100bn loan.
Astra declined yesterday to state how many shares the Soeryadjayas would
sell or to whom. Brokers say the family may be preparing to sell up to 90m
shares, almost half their holding, worth Rp1,125bn at the current market
price.
Brokers say possible buyers include General Electric of the US, Temasek (a
Singapore government investment fund), and Toyota of Japan. Brokers welcomed
the possibility of a large foreign partner being taken on board.
Astra accounts for about 7 per cent of Jakarta's stock market capital.

ALCOA, the world's largest producer of aluminium, and Al Zayani Investments
WWL of Bahrain are to form a joint venture to manufacture plastic bottle
caps for the growing Middle Eastern beverage market.
Under the agreement, to be completed next month, the venture, called Gulf
Closures, will immediately begin construction of a new plant in Bahrain.
The plant is scheduled for start-up in the first quarter of 1993 and will
produce over 200m compression-moulded plastic closures by the end of next
year. By 1997, it is expected to make more than 550m closures annually.
Alcoa Closure Systems International, an Alcoa subsidiary and the world's
largest producer of plastic and aluminium closures and capping equipment,
will own 49 per cent of the Gulf Closures.
Mr Timothy Leveque, ACSI's president, said the decision to go ahead with the
joint venture was based on better economic conditions in the Middle East and
an improving market for consumption of cold beverages. 'Worldwide beverage
companies are targeting the Middle East for market development,' he said.
The introduction of advanced packaging systems, including returnable plastic
containers, is expected to spur consumption. Per capita consumption of soft
drinks is 27 litres a year in Saudi Arabia, 23 litres in Egypt and 18 litres
in Bahrain, against US consumption of 180 litres a year.
Al Zayani Investments has interests in banking, services tendering, hotels,
property and light manufacturing.

NIPPON Shinpan, the leading Japanese consumer credit company, suffered
declines in non-consolidated profits for the year to March due to slowing
consumer demand and larger interest burdens.
Non-consolidated pre-tax profits fell 10.7 per cent to Y11.8bn (Dollars 91m)
on a 6.3 per cent rise in revenues to Y352.1bn. After-tax profits fell 14.1
per cent to Y6bn.
Revenue from card credits rose 15.1 per cent to Y900bn. However, shopping
loans fell 0.3 per cent to Y866.4bn and loans declined 15.9 per cent to
Y1,435.8bn.
Financial costs rose 7.3 per cent to Y166.5bn. The company posted profits of
Y10.5bn from sales of its stock investments, while realised losses on stock
holdings totalled Y3.2bn.
For the current year to March 1993, Nippon Shinpan forecasts an 8.2 per cent
rise in revenues to Y381bn and a 0.8 per cent increase in pre-tax profits to
Y12bn.

THE recent riots in Los Angeles have cost insurers an estimated Dollars 775m
 -making the events of early May by far the most expensive civil disorder
ever seen in the US, writes Nikki Tait.
According to the Insurance Information Institute, the LA losses easily
exceeded those resulting from the 1965 Watts riots, also in Los Angeles.
At the time, the Watts riots caused Dollars 44m in insured losses. After
allowing for inflation, this would equate to about Dollars 183m today.
The latest LA riots rank fifth in terms of catastrophic losses for the
insurance industry. The worst damage came from Hurricane Hugo, which cost
insurers about Dollars 4.2bn.
This was followed by the Oakland fire disaster last year (Dollars 1.26bn).

<TEXT>
ARGENTINA'S congress has approved controversial legislation allowing
privatisation of the state-owned natural gas monopoly.
The government may now go ahead with its stalled plans to break up the
company, Gas del Estado, and sell its transport and distribution networks to
private investors in an operation expected to raise about Dollars 2.7bn.
The Gas del Estado (GDE) sale will be one of Argentina's largest
privatisations, following the sale in 1990 and 1991 of its telephone network
and airline. The government intends to sell off almost all federally-owned
companies by the end of 1992. YPF, the national oil company, is being
prepared for privatisation in 1993.
The legislation was held up for months by provincial politicians
representing gas producing regions. Government officials say they expect to
announce a call to tender by September and award individual business units
to investors by December, three months later than planned.
The legislation splits GDE's trunk pipelines into two companies covering the
north and south of the country.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: State works help big Japanese
builders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT THOMSON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE volatility of Japan's property market slowed orders for most contractors
in the fiscal year just ended, though a steady flow of public works business
bolstered revenue for the industry's larger companies.
The striking contrast between the larger contractors with a broad business
base and the smaller concentrated on housing and resort development was
highlighted by the vastly different earnings statements released yesterday
by Kajima, a general contractor, and Nichimo, an apartment builder.
Kajima reported a 14.7 per cent increase in sales, to Y1,951bn (Dollars
14.67bn) and a 20 per cent increase in pre-tax profit, to Y123.9bn. Nichimo
Corporation, meanwhile, suffered a pre-tax loss in its first half to the end
of March of Y4.9bn, compared with a profit of Y3.5bn in the same period last
year.
It also revealed a 59.5 per cent fall in sales, to Y17.5bn, and a 10 times
increase in inventory to 2,300 apartments.
Although housing starts in Japan last year fell from 1.7m to 1.37m, even the
reduced production was still too much for a market damaged by a spate of
speculative building in the late 1980s. Meanwhile, civil engineering
contracts rose by 6.9 per cent last year, and public construction works were
18.5 per cent higher.
Contractors are hoping to benefit from the Japanese government's plan to
stimulate the economy by increasing budget outlays in the first half of the
year, and its promise to expand investment in infrastructure.
A construction industry leader, Obayashi, was bruised in spite of the
cushion provided by public works spending. It reported a 12.5 per cent fall
in pre-tax profit to Y52.8bn, on a 13.3 per cent increase in sales to
Y1,509bn.
Obayashi blamed the fall on an increase in interest payments on loans taken
to cover bills unpaid by the company's customers, and by appraisal losses of
Y5.6bn on securities holdings. For the current year, it is expecting a
slight increase in profit to Y55bn on sales of Y1,610bn.
And the current period will not be as buoyant for Kajima, which is
forecasting that pre-tax profits will fall by almost 20 per cent to Y103bn
on marginally higher sales of Y2,000bn.
It reported that short-term holdings of land expanded from Y196bn to
Y229.9bn, apparently as a result of the difficulty in offloading new
properties, while its unrealised gains on short-term stocks fell from
Y186.6bn to Y116.8bn last year.
Two other leading contractors, Shimizu and Taisei, announced profit
increases. However, they also expect the current year to be more difficult.
Shimizu reported a 7.5 per cent lift in pre-tax profit to Y124.5bn, on a
13.1 per cent increase in sales to Y2,130bn, though orders received rose by
only 2 per cent during the year.
For the current year, Shimizu's sales are expected to grow by about 3 per
cent to Y2,200bn, while pre-tax profit will remain at around Y125bn.
Taisei reported an 18.9 per cent rise in pre-tax profit, to Y96.4bn, and is
expecting a 6.8 per cent rise this year. Sales were 10.9 per cent higher at
Y1,717bn, though revenue from housing construction fell 6.2 per cent and the
company reported Y9.3bn in appraisal losses on securities holdings.

Dasa deal

<TEXT>
FOKKER, the Dutch aircraft maker, yesterday insisted that it must remain the
'leading company' in any deal that involves a majority of its shares being
sold to Deutsche Aerospace (Dasa) of Germany and, possibly, to Aerospatiale
of France and Alenia of Italy.
The company, which is engaged in bilateral negotiations with Dasa, said
other companies such as Aerospatiale and Alenia would be allowed to join the
European consortium only if they refrain from any involvement in the
development or production of aircraft which compete with those of Fokker or
Dasa.
If these terms are accepted, the French and the Italians would be forced to
give up their hopes of developing an 80 to 130-seat regional jetliner with
Dasa.
Fokker is, however, leaving open the possibility that the French, the
Italians and other companies such as British Aerospace would take part in a
European regional jet project in which Fokker would form the nucleus.
The Dutch company said that it and Dasa were in agreement that Fokker would
be the 'leading company, now and in the future, in the development,
building, selling and servicing of regional aircraft in the 65-130 seat
range'.
Fokker has always insisted it would be faster and cheaper to develop a
regional jet on the basis of its existing 100-seater Fokker 100 rather than
designing an entirely new aircraft.
Mr Erik Jan Nederkoorn, chairman, yesterday emphasised that the company was
holding two sets of parallel talks with Dasa and with the Dutch government,
which owns 32 per cent of Fokker's shares.
Earlier this week, Aerospatiale said that the Fokker talks were focused on
Dasa taking a 26 per cent share, with the French and Italians to get 12.5
per cent each, giving the European 'Regioliner' consortium majority control.

DEUTSCHE Bank, Germany's largest bank, yesterday said its profits growth had
slowed this year and Mr Hilmar Kopper, chief executive, indicated that there
was little chance of a further dividend rise.
Operating profits in the group grew by 10 per cent in the first four months
and by 4 per cent at the parent bank. The comparison is with one third of
last year's total profit. Commerzbank recently reported a 70 per cent jump
in the first two months, although the rise was 25 per cent if compared with
one sixth of last year's full result.
Mr Kopper said that the credit situation was worsening in parts of the
German economy and it was thus too early to forecast a rise in the dividend.
Last year, the bank raised operating profits by 16.5 per cent to nearly
DM6bn (Dollars 3.6bn) and is lifting the 1991 distribution by DM1 to DM15 a
share.

restrictions at Continental

   HANOVER
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PIRELLI, the Italian tyre-company, is launching its second attempt to curb
voting restrictions at Continental, Pirelli's German rival in the European
tyre-markets.
The move represents a new outbreak of hostilities between the companies,
which in December last year abandoned discussions after nearly 18 months of
merger talks. The news emerged yesterday as Continental announced it will
make a clear profit this year after losing DM128m (Dollars 80m) at the group
level in 1991.
The Italian company, which owns 5 per cent of its German rival and has
options over a further 34 per cent after last year's abortive takeover
attempts, has linked up with one other Italian shareholder to launch a
challenge to the rule which limits voting rights in Continental to 5 per
cent, no matter how big the stake.
Mr Hubertus von Grunberg, Continental's chief executive, yesterday said he
had spoken to legal and financial advisers and was convinced the move was
aggressive. It will be voted on by shareholders at the company's annual
shareholders' meeting in July.
This curb, in place at a number of large German companies, is seen by the
Continental management as a guarantee of its independence. It faced a
similar challenge at a special shareholders' meeting last March. It lost the
vote - which needs a simple majority - but the voting restriction is still
in place while Continental appeals against the decision in the courts.
Pirelli responded to Mr Grunberg's by saying the removal of the voting curb
would simply help clarification of the value of its stake, and this should
in no way be seen as aggressive.
However, analysts said the move could pose complications for Continental's
proposed DM150m rights issue, announced earlier this month, for if relations
between the two companies deteriorate, Pirelli may not vote its stake for
the share issue. It could also be seen as an attempt by the Italian company
to ensure it obtains the highest price possible for its share stake, on the
assumption that shares in Continental without voting restrictions would be
worth more than with the block still in place.
Mr Grunberg said the hostilities did not affect talks between the two
companies over the possible purchase of some of Pirelli's non-tyre
businesses. And the door was open for full merger talks in 'two to three
years time', he said.

AEG, the troubled Daimler-Benz subsidiary, will break even in 1993 at the

Although group turnover will fall this year as a result of withdrawing from
cable and office equipment manufacturing, sales had already risen 6 per cent
in the first four months of 1992.
Mr Stockl said he expected a 10 per cent overall increase to DM12bn (Dollars
3.54bn) for the full year, compared with DM14bn for 1991.
Confirming losses of DM624m in 1991, he said the only divisions to make any
profits were the core electrical components and transmission business and
the domestic appliance subsidiary.
Responding to persistent rumours that AEG appliances is to be sold, Mr
Stockl said it was working at full capacity and would remain part of the
group.

Mr Rossignolo is chairman of Zanussi, the Italian white goods group owned by

concern. Together, they control Sofin, a private company which has run
Seleco since 1989.
However, formal control of Seleco has remained with REL, a company set up in
the early 1980s to save troubled consumer electronics groups following an
industry crisis. Seleco, formerly part of the Zanussi group, came under the
control of REL in 1983.

FT  22 MAY 92 / International Company News: BP and Banesto clash over stake
undertaking

<TEXT>
A SIMMERING row between British Petroleum and La Corporacion Banesto, the
Spanish industrial conglomerate, flared yesterday amid accusations that each
had acted in in bad faith.
At the centre of the row is an alleged undertaking by Banesto, the large
retail bank that controls La Corporacion, to buy from BP 2.5 per cent of
stock in the bank. This stake was held by Petromed, Spain's third largest
oil refiner, which was acquired by the British company for Dollars 578m in
June last year.
The British company allegedly does not want the Banesto stock, which
represents Pta7.6bn (Dollars 73.07m) at current market prices, and Banesto
is unwilling to purchase it.
The dispute surfaced at yesterday's annual shareholders' meeting of La
Corporacion, which was attended by BP because it also owns 2 per cent of the
conglomerate's equity as a result of the Petromed purchase.
BP's representative at the meeting first irritated Mr Mario Conde, chairman
of La Corporacion and Banesto, with questions from the floor. He then voted
against the approval of La Corporacion's 1991 accounts.
BP's defiant stand broke the traditionally complacent and
self-congratulatory atmosphere of such meetings in Spain. The UK company's
spokesman put 16 questions to La Corporacion's board that probed allegedly
over-valued investments, consultant's fees and loans.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Italians get a taste for the Lancashire
pizza
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HAMILTON FAZEY, Northern Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GREATER Manchester manufacturer has developed a new variation on the
'coals to Newcastle' theme by selling pizzas to Italy in increasing
quantities. The company, which also makes 35 per cent of the pizzas sold by
UK superstores as their own brands, was bought out yesterday by its
management for Pounds 15.5m.
Canadian Pizza Crust (UK) makes frozen pizza casings at Weaste in the former
Salford enterprise zone. Toppings are added in a second plant at Nelson,
Lancashire. Annual sales have nearly doubled to Pounds 11m during the
recession and are expected to rise to Pounds 16m this year.
The company attributes success to pressing its pizza cases into shape
through rollers, proofing them, and then rolling them again - an advance on
merely cutting them out of big sheets of pastry. Mr Harry Kent, who founded
the business in 1986 with Mr Gino Molinaro, a Canadian, says this ensures a
fluffy texture develops during baking.
Before building the Salford factory, Mr Kent was Mr Molinaro's UK importer.
Mr Molinaro has since sold his Canadian operations to Heinz.
He and Mr Kent have now sold the UK operation to the buy-out team, but Mr
Kent has reinvested half of his own proceeds back into the business, which
he will continue to run. Mr Alan Featherstone, his commercial director, has
joined in the buy-out, together with Mr Wilf Austin, the finance director.
The Manchester office of Murray Johnstone, the Scottish finance house, has
taken Pounds 7m of equity, 3i has Pounds 2.5m and ECI Ventures Pounds 1m.
Murray Johnstone also negotiated Pounds 2.5m of senior debt with 3i and is
putting Mr Peter Woodall on the pizza company's board.
Mr Kent is particularly pleased at breaking into Italy. His pizza cases are
now sold in supermarkets in Rome, Venice, Turin, and Naples, with expansion
into Milan later this year.
The company now plans to build a factory in southern France to supply
growing markets in Switzerland, Spain and Greece. The pizzas are also
selling well in the Netherlands and Norway.
Employment has grown from 30 in 1986 to 250 jobs. Murray Johnstone said
research predicts a growing UK market because of demand for convenience
foods that are quick to prepare and have a healthy image. A growing segment
is the in-store delicatessen custom-made pizza, for which the company
supplies cases.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Restructured Whessoe advances 19% to Pounds
3.67m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHESSOE, the engineering and pipework group 'significantly restructured'
since 1989, has maintained its progress with a 19 per cent pre-tax profits
advance to Pounds 3.67m in the six months to March 31.
The rise from Pounds 3.09m was struck on turnover boosted by acquisitions to
Pounds 36.6m (Pounds 25.2m). In September the piping systems division was
augmented by the Pounds 8m purchase of Connex Pipe Systems of the US. Elcon
Instruments of Milan, Italy, was joined in the instrumentation and control
side this January by Varec, a California-based maker and distributor of tank
gauges and vapour control products.
A 1-for-4 rights issue raising Pounds 8.1m helped pay Varec's Pounds 11.1m
purchase price, but Mr Chris Fleetwood, chief executive, stressed that the
group remained cash positive.
He added that the group had completed its first phase of change away from
heavy engineering and that its future direction was towards niche markets
such as instrumentation and control. However Whessoe 'was not emotionally
attached to any one business'.
In the period the holding in the Australian pipe and boiler fabricator was
sold, resulting in a extraordinary credit of Pounds 495,000, and Whessoe
(Ireland), the group's last heavy engineering fabrication business was
bought by its management for about Pounds 700,000.
The interim dividend is lifted to 2.2p (2p), payable from earnings only up
to 11.7p (10.2p) after dilution by the rights.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: William Cook drops 60% and cuts dividend
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WILLIAM COOK, the Sheffield-based steel castings group, yesterday cut its
dividend after reporting a 60 per cent fall in profits as recession
continued to hit sales.
Mr Andrew Cook, chairman and chief executive, blamed changes in accounting
treatment for part of the sharp fall and said 'shareholders should not be
disappointed at the results'.
William Cook shares, nevertheless fell 47p to 283p, a sign of the City's
displeasure with the dividend cut.
Pre-tax profits in the year to March 28 fell from Pounds 12.2m to Pounds
4.76m on sales down 16 per cent at Pounds 111.2m. These figures included
Pounds 3.3m of exceptional costs covering rationalisation and plant closures
during the last and current years.
In the past William Cook generally treated such plant closures and
rationalisation costs below the line as extraordinary items or wrote them
off against acquisition provisions.
Earnings per share under the new treatment fell from 46.29p to 15.03p. Under
the old treatment the fall would have only been to 25.27p. The company has
cut the final dividend to 5p (9p), giving a total of 10p (14p).
The recession had necessitated further job cuts and other cost cuts. The
current year had brought no relief from recession although orders had picked
up in some group companies.
COMMENT
William Cook will not be the only company to bemoan accounting changes. But
the plain fact is that when a company is closed or trimmed it costs real
cash. To allow that cost to be written off below the line flies in the face
of common sense - if one accepts accounts are supposed to reflect the true
state of a business - and is a practice that is well buried. As for William
Cook's prospects, shareholders can do little but wait for a turnround in the
economy before this low technology metal basher does anything exciting.
Granted William Cook has almost single handedly rationalised the steel
foundry industry in the UK, becoming the most profitable producer in Europe
in the process. But few rationalisation opportunities remain as it already
dominates the domestic market and many potential continental European
targets remain in unholy alliance with their respective governments. As it
travels this somewhat dull route, William Cook's profits are likely to
recover to Pounds 7m this year, or earnings of 22p, followed by Pounds 10m
and 31.8p of earnings.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Second half boost for Storehouse
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN FOOTBALL parlance, it was a game of two halves at Storehouse last year.
After a pretty dismal first six months in which it lost Pounds 13.9m, the
retailing group, which includes BhS, Mothercare, Habitat, Richards and
Blazer, recorded a strong improvement in the second half with trading
profits for the period bouncing to Pounds 27.3m compared with Pounds 13.2m
the year before. Over the same period sales grew from Pounds 572m to Pounds
606.4m.
At the heart of Storehouse's turnround was a strong recovery from BhS, the
clothing and homeware group, which has undergone something of a
metamorphosis under the direction of its chief executive, Mr David Dworkin -
who it was announced yesterday would replace Mr Michael Julien as group
chief executive.
BhS contributed Pounds 22.1m (Pounds 21.6m) to full year trading profits and
Pounds 634.7m (Pounds 617.7m) to sales. But Mr Dworkin believes there are
further significant benefits to be reaped from BhS. 'My own view is that the
month we are in is the best we have ever had. Last year we had our 'May
mania' when everything that was not tied down was on sale. But even so we
are beating the living hell out of those numbers this year,' he said.
However, it was not the same story across the group. Although Storehouse
said the sales trend had improved since Christmas, the Mothercare
childrenswear business experienced a sharp fall into a Pounds 3.9m loss for
the year reversing a previous profit of Pounds 6.8m. This decline was blamed
on increased costs and intensified competition. Sales were slightly down at
Pounds 233.8m (Pounds 234.8m).
Habitat, the furniture group, also had a tough year recording losses of
Pounds 8.8m against Pounds 11.9m. Its French arm made a strong contribution,
but the UK was weak and Conran's Habitat in the US lost Pounds 7.7m although
remedial action was promised this year. Habitat's sales also fell marginally
to Pounds 201.2m (Pounds 205.9m).
The Richards womenswear chain recorded a small increase in operating profits
but Blazer made a small loss. Together, they accounted for Pounds 600,000
(Pounds 1.7m) of profits and Pounds 110.1m (Pounds 103.2m) of sales.
Staff numbers were cut by about 500 to 14,260 during the year.
Storehouse devoted Pounds 45m to capital expenditure but is stepping up its
investment programme this year to more than Pounds 60m.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Deeper loss at Westbury
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTBURY, the Cheltenham-based housebuilder, continued to suffer from the
slump in the housing market and yesterday announced its second successive
year of losses.
The pre-tax deficit of Pounds 15.1m was up from last time's Pounds 8.12m.
The losses followed exceptional charges of Pounds 15.8m, mainly to cover
write-downs on land values. Exceptional charges of Pounds 13.5m last year
had proved to be too low.
Mr Richard Fraser, chairman and chief executive, said he was cautious about
the outlook and that house prices were unlikely to pick up this year.
Turnover fell to Pounds 131.8m (Pounds 171.1m). A total of 2,277 homes were
sold at an average price of Pounds 56,300, compared to 2,576 houses at
Pounds 61,900 previously. The lower average price achieved partly reflected
the company's concentration on smaller houses.
Losses per share were 17.4p (14p), but the directors have recommended a
maintained final dividend of 5.75p for an unchanged total of 9p, uncovered
for the second year running.
Net borrowings reduced sharply to Pounds 12.4m (Pounds 55.8m) helped by last
year's Pounds 20.7m rights issue and a fall in stocks. Gearing fell from 59
to 13 per cent and interest costs almost halved to Pounds 3.96m.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Sketchley ends year Pounds 6m in the black
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SKETCHLEY, the dry cleaning and textile services company which came close to
collapse in 1990 before new management moved in, yesterday announced a
return to profits and resumed dividend payments.
Pre-tax profits were Pounds 6.02m in the year to March 27 compared with a
Pounds 5.26m loss. This was mainly due to benefits from cost cutting and a
reduced interest charge.
Mr Tony Bloom, deputy chairman, said Sketchley, which at one stage was
losing Pounds 800,000 a month, was out of trouble. 'We've made the base
secure. It's now time to develop via acquisitions,' he said. These could be
add-ons to existing businesses or new ventures, he added.
Sketchley's recovery had been highlighted at the interim stage when profits
of Pounds 3.19m compared to losses of Pounds 5.54m. Turnover for the full
year fell to Pounds 107.1m (Pounds 157.9m) although the prior year figure
included the vending machine division, since sold.
Continuing businesses were affected by recession. The textiles division's
operating profits fell to Pounds 5.5m (Pounds 6.3m) while dry cleaning fell
to Pounds 2.18m (Pounds 2.38m).
Positive cash flow reduced net borrowings from Pounds 31.6m to Pounds 11.9m,
or 31.3 per cent of shareholders' funds (89.3 per cent). The interest charge
fell to Pounds 2.62m (Pounds 6.15m).
Earnings were 7.8p against losses of 6.9p last time. The company is
recommending a final dividend of 3p, which is 2.6 times covered.
The group reported little progress on various outstanding legal disputes,
which include an expected writ from Eurocopy over its 1989 purchase from
Sketchley of Equipu. Sketchley said any proceedings would be 'vigorously
contested'.
COMMENT
Sketchley's new management has done everything right so far by concentrating
on its two core divisions, stripping out costs and reducing borrowings. The
next task will be to improve the remaining businesses. These figures provide
mixed portents. Operating profits are up but margins for dry cleaning and
textile services both fell, from 4.5 to 4.2 per cent and from 12.1 to 11.3
per cent respectively. This may just be a reflection of the severity of the
recession, but it is slightly disappointing since staff numbers have fallen
from 5,000 to 4,650 and Sketchley outlets from 500 to 470 in the past two
years, thereby reducing overheads. Forecast profits of Pounds 8m put the
shares, which closed down 1p at 154p, on 14 times. Given the 41 per cent
rise in the share price since May 9, investors may prefer to wait for a
little consolidation, especially if a hot summer prompts people to bring out
their cottons, which rely on the washing machine rather than the dry
cleaner.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Butte initiates legal action in US claiming
damages of Dollars 325m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BUTTE MINING, which at present has a market value of about Pounds 5m, has
launched a legal action in the US against a number of defendants, including
former directors and advisers, claiming damages of Dollars 325m (Pounds
183.6m).
It also is asking for this to be trebled under US anti-racketeering
legislation.
Named among the defendants are Mr Clive Smith, the Midlands entrepreneur who
has been involved in a number of oil and mining ventures, and Mr Martin
Byatt, whose firm Byatt Michau &amp; Smart, was Butte's legal adviser.
Also named are Ernst &amp; Young, the international accountancy group, and
Robertson Research, the UK minerals consultancy organisation and Simon
Engineering, its parent since last year. Mr Roy Bichan, who at one time was
chairman of both Robertson and Butte, is also among the defendants named.
The suit, filed in the US District Court in Montana, Butte division, by
Butte Mining's contingent-fee lawyers, Deutsch and Frey of New York, makes
extensive allegations of fraud and misrepresentation.
It claims damages from about 100 companies and individuals.
None of those contacted about the suit yesterday had seen the details and
some - including Ernst &amp; Young - withheld comment. However, Mr Smith said:
'I have never been involved in any racketeering. Any claims are frivolous.'
He said that his family's shareholding in Butte remained at the same level
as when the company was launched on the London Stock Exchange in October
1987: some 19m shares.
A Simon Engineering spokesman said any allegations were strongly denied by
Robertson which had taken extensive legal and other professional advice at
the time of Butte's acquisition of its US interests. 'If and when
proceedings are received, they will be defended vigorously (by Robertson).'
Among the many allegations, Butte has complained that in 1988 it paid Pounds
51m, mainly in shares, then priced at Pounds 1.25 each, for a company whose
sole asset, bought only a short while before, had cost Dollars 90,566.
It has also alleged that shareholders were told Butte was fully indemnified
against environmental liabilities in respect of some of its US properties,
when it was not.
Papers filed in connection with the suits contend that these matters came to
light only in the first quarter of 1992 as a result of new management,
including Mr David Lloyd-Jacob, a former Consolidated Gold Fields managing
director, who was recruited by Credit Lyonnais Laing.
No trial date had yet been fixed but Butte believes the case might reach
court at the end of 1993. It said: 'No assurance can be given as to the
eventual outcome of the suits, nor of the amounts of damages that may be
recovered.'
The Butte share price remained unchanged after the news at 2p.

A Takeover Panel ruling yesterday diminished the chances that former
shareholders in Davy Corporation, which Trafalgar House took over last June,
will ever receive their second payment of Pounds 54m.
The Panel ruled that shareholders were given all the information and
warnings necessary concerning the Ocean Emerald rig, the conversion of which
cost Davy its independence.
Trafalgar made the second payment, worth 45p per share, conditional on it
receiving payment from Midland and Scottish Resources, which ordered the rig
but has so far been unable to draw on letters of credit to pay for it.

FT  22 MAY 92 / UK Company News: Concerto attacks share structure at Liberty
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONCERTO Capital, the vehicle for South Africa's Myerson family, yesterday
maintained the assault on Liberty when it used its 15 per cent stake in the
fashion retailer to demand an extraordinary general meeting to vote on
changes to the company's share structure.
Liberty complied with the request, and a meeting will be held in the next
four weeks.
Concerto complained that Liberty's share structure, which involves ordinary
and non-voting shares, is out of date.
It wants each non-voting share to be split in half, and one half given
voting rights. Ordinary shareholders would be compensated by a 1-for-2 bonus
issue.
Mr Brian Myerson said enfranchising non-voting shareholders would improve
the shares' marketability and allow Liberty easier access to capital. 'The
issue is that every shareholder should have a vote,' he said.
But Mr John Pugh, Liberty's finance director, was initially dismissive of Mr
Myerson's move. 'His whole thinking is dreadfully muddled. His proposals
would introduce another level of shares and complicate our relatively simple
structure,' he said.
Both sides claim support from institutions, which hold 74 per cent of the
non-voting shares.
Mr Myerson refused to comment on whether Concerto would finally bid for
Liberty, where the Stewart-Liberty family owns 35 per cent of the ordinary
shares, and claims support from other family members with a further 15 per
cent.
'Our ultimate objective is to increase value for all shareholders,' Mr
Myerson said.
If Concerto's proposals were accepted, its stake would be diluted to 13.4
per cent while the Stewart-Liberty holding would fall to 27 per cent.
Concerto's holding is less affected by dilution because it owns 7.6 per cent
of the non-voting shares.

<TEXT>
PLYSU, the plastic packaging and housewares manufacturer, has again reported
record pre-tax profits - in the year to March 31, they grew 26 per cent from
Pounds 7.52m to Pounds 9.47m.
High density polyethylene, the company's main plastics raw material, was
freely available again after the Gulf war and 'prices have stabilised at a
lower level', said Mr James Summerlin, chairman. The scale of the profits
rise was aided by the net cash position attained by the year-end, which
resulted in interest charges being cut by almost two-thirds to Pounds
364,000 (Pounds 1.04m).
Turnover in the UK slipped to Pounds 56.4m (Pounds 56.6m), while in the
Netherlands there was an 11 per cent increase to Pounds 9.64m (Pounds
8.67m). Mr Summerlin said turnover figures revealed 'a negative inflation
factor'. The company had passed the price savings on to its customers.
Mr Summerlin expected capital expenditure next year to top the Pounds 6.7m
(Pounds 5.6m) spent in the period under review.
Earnings rose to 13.9p (11.4p) and the final dividend is 4.35p (3.15p) for a
total of 6p (4.5p).

FT  22 MAY 92 / BT holds profits steady at Pounds 3.07bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGO DIXON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH Telecommunications yesterday argued that its prices should be less
tightly regulated following the first drop in its profits since
privatisation eight years ago.
Pre-tax profits for the year to the end of March fell fractionally by Pounds
2m to Pounds 3.073bn, as recession, competition and regulation took their
toll on revenues. The profits dip comes as BT is in the final stages of
negotiating a new price cap regime with Oftel, its regulator.
Mr Iain Vallance, chairman, argued that the lower profits would strengthen
his hand in these negotiations. He said the fact that the company's return
on capital - Oftel's main measure of profitability - had fallen to just
under 18 per cent in the final quarter from 20.6 per cent in the previous
year showed it was not making excess profits.
But BT was immediately accused of making excess profits by consumer groups,
the Labour Party and the unions.
The National Consumer Council and Mr Gordon Brown, Labour's industry
spokesman, demanded price cuts. Meanwhile, the Union of Communication
Workers described the profits as 'callous' given that the company was
cutting 24,000 jobs this year.
In the City, the 8.3 per cent increase in the dividend to 14.4p, included in
the results, was welcomed. More than 2m shareholders who paid 110p as a
first instalment in the government's share sale last December saw the
partly-paid share price rise 7.5p to 138.5p. The fully-paid price rose 8p to
360p.
Mr Laurence Heyworth, an analyst at stockbrokers Robert Fleming Securities,
said they were 'a sound set of results'.
Mr Vallance revealed that his salary would increase 3.3 per cent to Pounds
465,000 in the year to the end of July and that his profits-related bonus
had been cut from Pounds 150,000 to Pounds 90,000.
Last year, a 43 per cent salary increase provoked a public outcry and Mr
Vallance was forced to reveal that he had paid his bonus to charity - a
practice he is continuing this year.
Other executive directors' salaries have increased by about 3.5 per cent and
their bonuses are lower than last year.
