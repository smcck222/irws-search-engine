FT  27 JUN 92 / MPs see danger in BT vans' grey paint scheme
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID OWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS the largest fleet of commercial vehicles in Europe. But is it the
right colour?
British Telecom is in the process of repainting about 70,000 yellow cars and
vans grey. But now Mr Malcolm Bruce, Liberal Democrat trade and industry
spokesman, says the change is an example of a privatised utility pursuing 'a
corporate strategy that may well have compromised public safety'.
Indeed, three of the party's 20 MPs have put their names to a parliamentary
early day motion noting 'increasing public concern over the difficulty in
seeing BT vans when they are parked, due to their grey colour'.
The motion continues: 'Many British Telecom engineers are worried about
their safety due to the colour of their vans.' It urges Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, to talk to BT 'and ensure that better provisions are
made to make British Telecom vans more visible and thus safer'.
Mr Bruce said he had been told by BT employees of a number of 'near misses'.
He intended to try to win the support of MPs from other parties.
Mr Bruce has already secured the backing of the National Communications
Union, whose members use the vehicles.
The union said yesterday: 'It is vital that these vans are painted in the
safest possible colour.' It described the new livery as 'ghostly and
ghastly'.
BT said yesterday that it had no plans to make any changes to the new
design, which it announced in April last year.
It added: 'All the expert opinion we got said the new livery was as visible
as - if not more so than - the old livery.'

FT  27 JUN 92 / Ministers hasten pension change: Employers to restore fund
deficiencies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS and ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT has responded to pressure over the Maxwell affair by bringing
forward to next week the introduction of greater legal powers for pensioners
whose pension funds are wound up.
Social security ministers are expected to announce on Monday the
implementation of provisions in the 1990 Social Security Act to make any
deficiencies in pension funds a debt upon the employers.
Implementation had been delayed partly because of fears that, in a
recession, the extra burden on companies might push some into bankruptcy.
The move has been demanded by Tory and Labour MPs campaigning on behalf of
Maxwell pensioners and was hinted at in the Commons by Mr Peter Lilley,
social security secretary, earlier this month.
Ministers are expected to announce next week the membership of the
independent commission to review pension law, led by Professor Roy Goode.
An early announcement is also expected on the members of the trust, headed
by Sir John Cuckney, set up to solicit contributions on behalf of Maxwell
pensioners. The social security department is hoping soon to announce
further donations from institutions that benefited financially from dealings
with Robert Maxwell.
The greater legal powers for pensioners would help former Maxwell employees
only if the pension funds affected went into administration, but they might
be of wider significance for other vulnerable pension schemes. Pensioners
will have rights as official creditors to funds that are wound up.
The government hopes the Maxwell pension funds can remain solvent and
earlier this month announced Pounds 2.5m to 'drip feed' the worst affected.
Mr Lilley said then that the implemention of the 1990 provisions 'may be of
marginal benefit to some Maxwell pension schemes'. He appears to have
rejected opposition MPs' calls for pensioners to become preferential, rather
than unsecured, creditors.
Meanwhile, Mr Michael Meacher, shadow social security secretary, is
maintaining pressure on the government over its plans for a special unit to
recover pension fund assets. He has asked Mr Lilley to set out the unit's
objectives in terms of the amount of the assets it expects to recover within
a certain time.
He has demanded an assurance that the strategy will be reviewed if those
targets are not met.
Mr Meacher also believes the government should use its powers under the
Financial Services Act to bring the regulatory regime back under its direct
control.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Smith and Gould clash during leadership debate
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE TWO contenders for the Labour leadership clashed last night after the
decision this week by the party's national executive committee to postpone
the introduction of a one-member, one-vote selection system for
parliamentary candidates.
Mr John Smith, the odds-on favourite to become leader next month, insisted
that Labour 'is capable of making the changes that are necessary' to win the
next general election.
The party would move to adopt one member, one vote for candidate selection,
change the system of electing the leader and modernise its relationship with
the unions, he said.
But Mr Bryan Gould, the shadow environment secretary, warned that unless
Labour could shake off its preference for 'old certainties' and set a new
agenda, it ran the risk of losing the next election as well.
He said: 'Unless we can break through this torpor and consciously set out a
convincing, radical prospectus for the voters of 1996, we are in danger of
facing a further defeat.'
In a leadership debate with Mr Gould, Mr Smith said Labour needed to show
its commitment to practical, positive freedoms and to develop a strategy for
'citizenship and community'.
'We must offer a path to personal empowerment by encouraging responsibility
and participation in a democracy in which power is more widely shared,' he
said, in an oblique attack on the more 'consumerist' nature of the
government's Citizen's Charter.
He accused the Tories of trying to present decisions as determined by the
market when they were really about political will - for example, their moves
to introduce market mechanisms to the health service.
The attempt to 'take the politics out of politics' would fail, he said,
because it ignored the power of vested interests and assumed that markets
always worked.

FT  27 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: Denmark's strategy to rejoin the team -
More democracy and openness will tempt Copenhagen back onto EC playing field
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
ONLY more open and accountable decision-making will enable the Community to
continue moving forward as 12, Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, the Danish foreign
minister, said yesterday.
Denmark would wait to the end of the year before deciding whether to put new
proposals to its voters, who narrowly rejected the Maastricht treaty on June
2, triggering a crisis in the EC.
'What we need is more democracy in the institutions, more open
decision-making,' Mr Ellemann-Jensen said. 'We hope that this will lead to a
new landscape, where new decisions can be taken.'
He said there would have to be 'a much clearer situation' on how EC
decisions are taken before Denmark could 'make concrete suggestions' about
how to resolve the crisis.
He would not be drawn on whether his government would hold a new referendum,
but said 'political leaders should have the courage to propose changes to
their electors.'
In saying this he appeared to be hinting at the possibility of renegotiating
aspects of Maastricht, a possibility so far firmly ruled out by all 12
governments, including Denmark.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen was in ebullient form, arriving at the summit with a
Danish football team scarf and portable television before last night's
European championship final against Germany. 'If you can't join them, beat
them,' he said, predicting a 2-1 victory over Denmark's powerful neighbour.
Denmark won 2-0.
Afterwards Mr Ellemann-Jensen said: 'It shows small states can win. And
Europe needs small states.'
Fear of being smothered by Germany is said to have been one reason why
Danish voters turned against the Maastricht treaty, opposition to which has
grown with the Danish football team's surprising run of victories.
Back on the EC playing field, Mr Ellemann-Jensen said: 'The 11 are playing
and we are sitting on the bench right now, but I hope we'll soon be back on
the field.'
Meanwhile Mr Poul Schluter, the Danish prime minister, told his colleagues
there needed to be more democratic control over decisions by the Council of
Ministers as well as the Commission.

FT  27 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: Lisbon fails to solve central bank
squabble
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN

<DATELINE>
   LISBON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A PLAN to site the headquarters of the European Central Bank in Bonn and its
operating arm in London ran into serious opposition last night and will be
discussed later today.
The plan by the Portuguese presidency is the first attempt at a solution to
emerge publicly in more than two years. However, it puts into play the issue
of how the Community is to find a home for six planned new institutions.
In advance of last night's discussion by EC leaders of sites, Mr Dieter
Vogel, the German spokesman, said it was unacceptable for the central bank's
'nameplate to be in Bonn, and the real work to be done elsewhere'. Publicly,
the UK matches Germany in wanting the whole bank for itself, but in private
UK officials admit London would be quite content to get the ECB's foreign
exchange arm.
The third element in Portugal's compromise on the bank - a Dutch head for
the bank - also failed to win the backing of the Dutch government. It
believes its case for the bank going to Amsterdam was strengthened when
London was chosen as the site of the European Bank for Reconstruction and
Development.
The key to resolving the deadlock would be a deal between France and Belgium
over the European Parliament. Portugal has suggested a pledge that the
French city of Strasbourg would continue to host a minimum of 12 plenary
sessions of the parliament, but that MEPs could hold up to five
'extraordinary' full sessions in Brussels, where many deputies find it
convenient to be close to other EC bodies.
Other elements of the Portuguese package would place the EC's planned
environment agency in Copenhagen, its trademark office (agreed in principle
a decade ago) in Madrid, its training foundation (for eastern Europe) in
Berlin, and a mooted drugs agency in Lisbon.
Putting the environment agency in Copenhagen would be a clear sop to the
Danes, but were Denmark eventually to hive off from the Community, Milan
could be a candidate for the agency.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Rabin pledge on freezing settlements
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY and REUTER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   TEL AVIV, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ISRAEL'S prime minister-elect, Mr Yitzhak Rabin, said yesterday he would
freeze Jewish settlements in areas of the occupied territories he does not
consider vital to Israel's security. He would also cut off state subsidies
to existing settlements beyond that available to equivalent areas within
Israel.
The Labour party leader reiterated his support for elections among
Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza Strip to choose 'a body that will
serve as a self-governing authority'. Palestinians had unsuccessfully sought
a settlement freeze and such elections from the outgoing government led by
the Likud party.
Mr Rabin said he was optimistic he would be ready to present a Labour-led
coalition government to parliament when the Knesset resumes in mid-July.
Peace negotiations are tentatively set to resume in Rome at the end of July.
Final official results from Tuesday's general election showed Labour's total
in the 120-seat Knesset has slipped to 44 from the projected 45. But in
alliance with Meretz, a minority pro-peace grouping, and with the support of
small Arab parties, Mr Rabin can still command 61 seats.
Labour officials said yesterday they also expected two ultra-orthodox
religious parties to join the coalition. Likud, which won only 32 seats, is
set for opposition for the first time in 15 years.
Mr Rabin had previously said he would divert the estimated Shk3bn (Pounds
660m) the previous government spent on settlements to investment inside
Israel 'proper'. Yesterday, he said he would impose a freeze on 'political
settlements'.
He hoped this would facilitate Israel receiving Dollars 10bn in US loan
guarantees blocked because of Likud's refusal to freeze settlements.
However, Mr Rabin repeated that 'political' settlements did not include
those in the Jordan Valley, the Golan Heights or the Jerusalem area. He
would decide on his policy towards these later.
No change would be sought in the format of the current Middle East peace
negotiations, but he would change the content. He gave no details beyond
saying he supported interim arrangements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip as
envisaged in the 1979 Camp David accords with Egypt.
Likud yesterday was digesting the decision by Mr Moshe Arens, the defence
minister, to retire from politics. He was considered a leading contender to
succeed Mr Yitzhak Shamir, the prime minister, who is also expected to step
down soon as party leader. Mr Arens' departure may improve the chances of Mr
Binyamin Begin, son of the late Menachem Begin, Likud's first leader.
The US State Department yesterday condemned the violence in the West Bank
and Gaza, in which three Israelis and three Palestinians died on Thursday,
saying that those who resorted to such acts 'at this time' could only be
seen as 'enemies of peace', Reuter reports from Washington.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
EUROPEAN Community leaders last night declared their determination to save
the Maastricht treaty and reappointed its principle architect, Mr Jacques
Delors, to a further two-year term as European Commission president.
But while Mr Delors was unanimously reappointed at a late-night session of
the Community's Lisbon summit, the leaders remained divided over the pace of
admitting new member countries and the level of the EC budget.
Chancellor Helmut Kohl of Germany said that although Denmark had rejected
Maastricht, which sets out closer union, 'the Community should go ahead at
the same speed with all 12 passengers on board'.
Mr Uffe Ellemann-Jensen, Denmark's foreign minister, hoped that ratification
by Germany, France and the UK - coupled with a drive towards more open and
decentralised decision-making - would 'lead to a new landscape, where new
decisions can be taken'.
Mr Ellemann-Jensen was apparently hinting at the possibility of a second
referendum in Denmark, but he added: 'Political leaders should have the
courage to propose changes to their electors.' This could equally refer to
the possibility of renegotiating aspects of Maastricht, a prospect firmly
ruled out by all 12 governments.
Britain's tactic of luring Denmark back into the fold by starting
enlargement talks with European Free Trade Association countries during
London's forthcoming EC presidency found little support.
Mr Ruud Lubbers, the Dutch prime minister, suggested that, with the southern
EC countries pushing for more Community aid and the north preoccupied with
enlargement, public opinion would only be satisfied if the summit gave equal
weight to both issues.
EC leaders will try to achieve this in today's final communique. Just how
difficult this will be was underlined last night when Mr Anibal Cavaco
Silva, Portugal's prime minister, suspended the summit's plenary session.
Instead there would be talks with Mr Kohl and Mr Felipe Gonzalez, the
Spanish prime minister, standard-bearer of the south's quest for more
structural aid.
Earlier debate had shown positions far apart. A majority, led by Germany and
the UK, was opposed to making firm pledges of money. They backed a
suggestion by Mr Delors that a plan to increase EC spending by a third
should be stretched out over seven, rather than five, years.

<TEXT>
THE United Nations last night gave Serb forces 48 hours to end their
offensive in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo. The UN ultimatum came amid a
flurry of diplomatic activity aimed at launching a fresh Western initiative
to bring peace to the war-torn republic.
Earlier yesterday Mr Douglas Hurd, the UK foreign secretary, put forward a
five point peace plan at the EC summit in Lisbon, urging Community leaders
to set a July 3 deadline for Serbian forces to pull out completely from the
besieged city.
Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, the UN secretary general, in a statement to the UN
Security Council, said the UN was considering withdrawing its peace-keeping
troops from Sarajevo and would have to consider alternative means of
bringing relief supplies into the city if Serb forces did not withdraw.
Whether this could involve the use of force remains unclear. The Security
Council is to meet on Monday and Mr Jean-Bernard Merimee, the French
ambassador, said nothing would be excluded from consideration.
Yesterday, the US appeared to rule out the use of military intervention to
secure the implementation of an international aid airlift to the capital's
starving population, though the Pentagon said US forces in Europe had been
put on alert as long as 10 days ago to transport food and medical supplies.
After Mr George Bush held a meeting of his top security advisers yesterday,
Mr Brent Scowcroft, the US national security adviser said intervention was
not imminent.
He said the US would act only in concert with the UN and only after a
ceasefire had been secured around the airport of Sarajevo.
Further indications the West may not be close to armed intervention came
with British attempts to deflect calls from some of its European partners,
such as Italy and Germany, for a commitment to using force in Sarajevo.
Germany in particular was adamant early this morning that the Community
should leave all options open, though Bonn appeared to accept the main
points of the British initiative.
Mr John Major warned his fellow EC leaders that, in the absence of a
cease-fire, it might take more than 100,000 troops to secure Sarajevo
airport to allow a humanitarian airlift.
The Western European Union (WEU) nine-nation defence body did however agree
yesterday to meet early next month to consider possible naval measures to
enforce a United Nations embargo of Yugoslavia.
The series of moves came as the latest ceasefire in Bosnia broke down when a
bitter street battle for the former Olympic village of Dobrinja erupted and
UN forces returned fire at snipers near Sarajevo's airport.
The British plan put forward five points: The Community should ostracise the
Serb-led rump Yugoslavia and press for its expulsion from international
organisations, including the Conference on Security and Co-operation in
Europe, unless Serbian forces pull back to allow the reopening of Sarajevo
airport by July 3.
All Community member states should pledge aircraft and personnel to help in
an airlift as soon as conditions are right, including a ceasefire around
Sarajevo airport.
The European Commission should assemble humanitarian goods at an airport
near Sarajevo.
The current EC president, Portuguese prime minister, Anibal Cavaco Silva,
should contact the leaders of Serbia, Bosnia and Croatia in a follow-up to
their unsuccessful meeting with EC mediator Lord Carrington in Strasbourg on
Thursday.
Mr Cavaco Silva should contact UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros Ghali to
see what further action could be taken to support the United Nations.

FT  27 JUN 92 / BP shares fall 14% on fear of a possible dividend cut
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, JULIET SYCHRAVA and NORMA COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRITISH PETROLEUM shares fell by 14 per cent yesterday in the wake of
Thursday evening's boardroom coup which ousted Mr Robert Horton, the
chairman and chief executive. The shares closed at 209p, a loss of 34p on
the day, taking them to their lowest point since autumn 1986.
The sharp fall was prompted mainly by fears that the company's new
management, headed by Lord Ashburton, the chairman, would be forced to halve
the dividend to ease BP's strained balance sheet. There were also rumours of
a Pounds 1bn-Pounds 2bn rights issue.
In New York, where the shares are traded as American Depositary Receipts,
they suffered a Dollars 5 1/4 fall on Thursday but declined only 75 cents
yesterday to close at Dollars 48 3/8 , equivalent to about 213p a share.
Despite anxiety at the sudden change in leadership at the UK's third-largest
company by market capitalisation, the City of London was generally positive.
Analysts welcomed an end to the frictions caused by Mr Horton's management
style.
They also reacted favourably to the appointment of Mr David Simon as chief
executive. His financial background and diplomatic manner were seen as
positive attributes in the oil company's current difficult situation.
'He's more financially oriented and BP's problems are financial,' said Mr
Paul Spedding of Kleinwort Benson Securities.
It also emerged yesterday that the prime movers behind the coup were the
non-executive directors from the business community on BP's board.
Lord Ashburton, a former chairman of Barings merchant bank, Sir Patrick
Sheehy, chairman of BAT Industries, Dr Carl Hahn, chairman of Volkswagen,
and Mr Charles Knight, chairman of Emerson Electric, were said to be among
those most anxious to remove Mr Horton.
BP called large shareholders yesterday to say it would be in contact shortly
and that Mr Simon would be available to answer questions.
Institutional shareholders were concerned that the boardroom coup might have
been carried out with no alternative strategies in mind. The dominance of Mr
Horton's personality and the concentration of power in his dual role as
chairman and chief executive would have made it difficult for the new
management to prepare any new measures to deal with BP's difficulties.
Analysts said there had been recent signs that the second quarter's earnings
prospects had deteriorated. Some factors out of BP's control, such as the
weakness of the dollar, are likely to affect earnings, while
larger-than-expected redundancy costs in its US operations will also result
in a charge to earnings.
Mr Horton refused to comment. He was at his home in South Stoke, Oxfordshire
early yesterday. He bought the morning papers and later left by car with his
wife for Oxford.

FT  27 JUN 92 / The easy way to guarantee a friendly press: How the rich and
powerful can corrupt their critics
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DOMINIC LAWSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR John Junor once said of journalists: 'It is not power which corrupts; it
is not money which corrupts; it is friendship which corrupts.' The former
editor of the Sunday Express was absolutely right.
Any business tycoon who wants to buy the good opinions of a financial
journalist, or any member of parliament who wishes to ensure favourable
mentions from a political correspondent, need only offer the press man
friendship, or at least the illusion of it.
At the very least, they will be guaranteed an absence of spiteful copy from
the pundit in question. This is not a rule which works invariably, but it is
infinitely more effective than employing public relations advisers to pump
out press releases which nobody reads, still less believes. Journalists are
star-struck and like the idea of their social circle overlapping with that
of the rich and famous. Second, they like to think that, by maintaining a
close 'friendship' with these stars, one day they might be given a scoop.
They will, of course, but it will be a scoop which suits the political or
financial aspirations of the famous 'friend.'
The other week, this form of journalism came in for some criticism. The
editor of the Mail on Sunday - or whoever writes that paper's leading
articles - took it upon himself to lecture Charles Moore, deputy editor of
the Daily Telegraph. Moore had written an article in The Spectator critical
of the conduct of yet another editor who published details about the private
life of the Prince and Princess of Wales.
'What Mr Moore's readers couldn't guess,' said the editor of the Mail on
Sunday, 'was that he had an interest to declare. He is one of those
journalists who is reasonably close to the Prince of Wales, a position he
visibly relishes. There is nothing wrong with that, but journalists ought to
let their readers know when they are singing for their supper.'
On a matter of fact, this happens to be wrong. Having checked, I discover
that the deputy editor of the Daily Telegraph - a friend of mine, I admit -
has neither seen nor spoken to the Prince of Wales since October, 1990. But
this is not the point, which is that the editor of the Mail on Sunday is
reasonably close to the prime minister, a position he relishes. As a result,
he writes things such as that John Major 'has so much adrenalin that, if
only it could be marketed and sold for export, it would solve the balance of
payments problem for ever.'
Is he singing for his supper, when he publishes such stuff? Should his
readers be told? I do not know. But it is far more significant in the
parliamentary age for an editor to be in the pocket of a prime minister than
to be in the pocket of a Prince of Wales.
Perhaps the Prince of Wales should take a leaf out of John Major's book and
seduce with friendship those who are now so critical of him and his family.
His great-great-grandfather would certainly have advised him thus.
I have been reading Sir Sidney Lee's great biography of Edward VII,
completed a few years after the the monarch's death. When there was a great
surge of republican feeling in England in the 1870s (far more significant
than that engineered by parts of the press in recent weeks) Edward, then
Prince of Wales, simply neutralised the critics.
I quote from Sir Sidney: 'The Prince's readiness to meet socially critics of
monarchy was not at first blush encouraged, but the Prince's tact and grace
usually won the day. His first invitation to the Radical stalwart, Mr
Fawcett, to a garden party, was refused; but Mr Fawcett subsequently
accepted the Prince's hospitalities, and Mr (Joseph) Chamberlain, silencing
any earlier scruples, became the Prince's frequent guest. Of greater
significance, Sir Charles Dilke, the Radical champion of the
anti-monarchical movement, soon joined the Prince's intimate social circle .
. . The Republican wave had spent itself, and there was to be no more strife
between the Prince and the forces of Radicalism.'
Dominic Lawson is editor of The Spectator.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Private View: Mahler and money - the double life of Gilbert
Kaplan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTIAN TYLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LIKE EVERY amateur musician, Gilbert Kaplan has his party piece. But this
lanky Wall Street millionaire, founder and editor-in-chief of the financial
monthly Institutional Investor, is no musical mouse. His showpiece is to
conduct Mahler's 'Resurrection' Symphony, a vast, difficult work scored for
outsize orchestra, choir, soprano, alto, organ, bells and offstage brass.
Kaplan fell in love with the symphony when he was 23. Or was it infatuation?
'No,' he said, 'I think that is too weak a word. It's a torrid love-affair,
one that's gone on for a long time and to which I've been quite faithful . .
. and one which my wife Lena fully understands,' he added, laughing.
In 1981, already rich, he decided he must conduct the 'Resurrection'. It was
a Herculean task for someone whose musical education consisted of three
years' piano lessons between the ages of seven and 10. He hid himself away,
studying for up to nine hours a day to learn the score by heart. He took
lessons in conducting, advice from Sir George Solti and hired the American
Symphony Orchestra to practise with.
'One of the lessons I learned from this whole experience is that very
large-scale projects are often avoided because they seem daunting. What
enabled me to get started was to disaggregate it: I discovered one day I'd
learned a page of the score. So I said '209 days from now I will have
learned the whole symphony'.'
He emerged nearly a year later, mounted the podium at the Lincoln Centre,
New York, in front of an invited audience of 2,700 friends and clients, and
conducted for 90 minutes without the score. It was his party piece for the
15th birthday of Institutional Investor, a little surprise for his friends .
. . and an experience he had no intention of repeating.
But critics and players were so impressed that he was invited to do it again
in public. He has been conducting the second symphony, all over the world,
ever since. His 1988 recording of it with the London Symphony Orchestra has
sold 125,000 copies and reached the top of the British classical hit parade.
Gilbert Kaplan never wanted to be a conductor. He still doesn't. But he does
want to be regarded as a serious Mahlerian.
On Monday he publishes his second facsimile edition of Mahler's music (the
first, of course, was of the 'Resurrection', whose original he now owns). It
is a lavish boxed set containing a monograph and his recording of the
Adagietto, the miniature slow movement of the Fifth Symphony used in the
film Death in Venice and probably Mahler's best known melody.
Kaplan's research has convinced him that the Adagietto, usually played as a
12-minute dirge, is about love, not death. Mahler sent it as a love letter
to his wife Alma and meant it to last no longer than about eight minutes.
Kaplan's version, subtitled 'From Mahler with love' is to be issued as a CD
single - and could be another best-seller.
The infatuated publisher does not look like a man obsessed. He is languid,
polished and preppily dressed with his gold seahorse cufflinks, self-assured
but not overweening.
Had he been trying to prove something, or to show off? He replied in terms
of the lover who seeks physical consummation.
'I am not someone who seeks challenges for their own sake. I don't think
'Wouldn't it be nice to climb Mount Everest'. I fell in love with this music
and the idea of conducting it was a way of becoming more intimate, a way of
trying to get inside the music and understand what it was that compelled me
so much.
'I make no apologies for excessive behaviour, but it was personal excessive
behaviour, not directed to proving anything.'
Are you an exhibitionist?
'I don't believe I am. I may have achieved a few things in my life but they
have been done in rather traditional, normal ways. I'm not an extrovert in
general. I'm not someone who is terribly emotional in public. But when
you're on the podium you really do stand there naked and you have no choice.
You cannot put any limitations on yourself.'
So you would resent being described as a dilettante?
'Absolutely. I may be any number of things but I'm certainly not a
dilettante.
'In some ways I don't approve of what I do; I don't in general approve of
amateurs meddling in a professional world. But for me what I'm doing is a
matter of life and death.'
It would be wrong to see Kaplan as a musical monomaniac. He listens to
Wagner and Beethoven (Mahler's main influences) Prokoviev and baroque. He
can play bits of Rachmaninov, Gershwin and jazz on the piano; and he does
not like Mahler's Eighth Symphony much.
Nor does he especially identify with Mahler the man. He condemns the
composer's self-centredness and domineering treatment of his wife and
colleagues. If there was a similarity, he said, it was their shared
perfectionism. 'Mahler's motto was: Whatever you do, try and do it as well
as you can. I certainly feel that way.'
Kaplan has a middle-class Jewish background. His father was comfortably off,
having sold the family shirt-making business, but his parents were divorced
when he was five. I asked if Mahler's Jewishness struck a chord with him.
'Well, I think anyone who is Jewish and who reads what he had to go through
cannot fail to feel some affinity. It had a profound effect on him and I
have sympathy with his plight. In fact, it makes my blood boil. But no, I
don't find his being Jewish has anything to do with my attraction to his
music.'
Kaplan's love affair has not distracted him from life. In 1967, two years
after the coup de foudre and anxious to be self-employed, he started the
magazine with borrowed money. In 1984 he sold the business to Capital
Communications for a sum estimated by Wall Street at between Dollars 50m and
Dollars 70m. He continued as editor because, he said, he prefers journalism
to business: his strengths are his news sense and his ability to discover
good writers. Occasionally he goes out to interview people, like John
Gutfreund of Salomon Brothers and the late presidents Sadat and Marcos.
For someone who's job is finding out how others dispose of their wealth,
Kaplan is rather reticent about his own. However, he did offer one tip for
would-be millionaires.
'People trying to make money go about it completely the wrong way. If you
pick something you really love (and it's a business activity) you will do
extremely well. If you pick something where you think you'll make a lot of
money you probably won't do well because you'll be competing against people
who love what they do.'
He said there was 'no question' but that he could earn a living from music
now if he chose. But he wants to remain an amateur. Any profit he does show
goes to the foundation he has set up for musicological projects.
When I suggested his latest presentation box was a bit over the top for such
a little piece of music - that it was a rich man's foible - he looked as
wounded as a new mother whose baby has been called ugly.
'I don't tend to do things in moderation. I tried to create the most
wonderful publication I could for - my wife and I joke about it - for the 32
people who care.' He paused. 'Anyway,I don't do it for them, I do it for
me.'
After another pause: 'I wonder if after ten years I don't have some
Mahlerian credentials. While I would agree that as a conductor I would not
expect to hold my own, I'm not sure that Mahlerian scholars would think of
this as a rich man's toy.'
He said he would do anything to make Mahler's music better known. 'A Swedish
finance minister said back in the 1930s poverty shared by all is not
poverty. My equivalent of that is: extravagance on behalf of Mahler is not
extravagance.
Yet money had become a hindrance, he said. At the start it helped him to
learn his symphony - and that cost less than people imagined. Now it just
gets in the way, he said, because nobody can believe that today it is not he
who hires orchestras but they who engage him.
Kaplan's other extravagance is Surrealist pictures. He loves Salvador Dalis
(most of them), has lent some Magrittes to the present London exhibition and
is joint author of a catalogue of Magritte's lithographs and etchings. He
claims Mahler's music, in its use of clashing moods and sounds, foreshadows
Surrealism.
Why do you like Surrealism?
'I could say I like the idea of finding a reality by seeing real and unreal
things side by side. But that's probably nonsense. I like the paintings.
When I walk into the Museum of Modern Art where there's a room of
Surrealists, I come alive. I don't have to explain it.'
He thinks there is a touch of the surreal in his own life: the
self-controlled Wall Street analyst who at night dons the cape of the
maestro and lets fly with his emotions.
But Kaplan does not see his two lives as at all incongruous, even if his
love of Mahler is extreme. He thinks he is 'integrated'. After all, he
didn't choose to fall wildly in love with Mahler's 'Resurrection.'
'And there's something else. It's a mistake to think people have to lead
their lives sequentially. Most people talk about one career then the next,
then having time for their pleasures. I've never believed that's a healthy
way to live.
'If that triggers a reaction such as yours - that this is a rich man's
foible - so be it. But where is it ordained that only the people who do one
sort of work exclusively should be allowed to do it?
'I'll put it this way to you. I think there are always risks associated with
making an attempt to go outside your field, or making an attempt to try some
things that may fail or that some people may find odd. But I ask you this
question. What is really the greater risk, the possibility of making a fool
out of yourself, the possibility of failing, or to live your whole life
wondering what would it have been like if you'd tried, wondering what you
have given up?
'It takes a very compelling reason to go down the road I've gone. But I
don't think I had too much choice in the matter. I found myself on a one-way
conveyor belt into Mahler-land and, without any clear understanding of why I
was so driven, I had to do it.'
Do you think you'll grow out of it?
'I hope I don't. I may grow out of conducting; the moment it becomes a
routine, it'll be time to stop. I'll never grow out of Mahler.'

<BYLINE>
   By MICHAEL THOMPSON-NOEL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I WISH I'D never joined Ross Perot's team. I was in Bahrain last weekend,
breakfasting with sheikhs on muesli and figs, a sand-storm raging, when the
man who would be president telephoned from Dallas, heedless of the time
difference, to pick my brains on world affairs.
'How are you, boy?' asked Ross Perot. 'I must say you're an asset. But you
do skip around - one minute here, the next someplace else. Where are you
now, boy?'
'Bahrain,' I replied.
'Never heard of it,' said Perot. 'Is it a neighbourly kinda place? Upright
and church-going? An enemy of moral laxity? A friend of America's? I
couldn't tolerate a member of my election team prancing and cavorting in
some heathen spot. You're not playing roulette, boy? Terrible thing,
roulette. It breaks up whole families, causes untold anguish. I have said it
before and I will say it again: there's no room on my payroll for anyone who
plays roulette.'
'Of course I'm not playing roulette, Mr Perot,' I said. 'It's six in the
morning. I'm breakfasting with sheikhs. We've just finished our muesli. Now
we're eating figs. To answer your first question: Bahrain is neighbourly,
upright and moral. It's halfway down the Gulf. I'm sure you needn't worry
about it. There are sand-storms every day. Temperatures over 50`. Absolutely
ghastly. The smallest place imaginable. Just a few sheikhs, cosseted by
air-conditioning. In terms of the Middle East, it is a very small
pomegranate.'
'That's the boy,' said Ross Perot. 'You have a wonderful knack for telling
me things I don't know in plain and simple language. I'm glad you're on the
team. Write me a position paper on the Middle East and fax it to me here in
Dallas. The media keep complaining that they don't know what I stand for.
With you in the line-up, I'm able to disabuse them. Is your money getting
through?'
Ever since Ross Perot recruited me two weeks ago to help him win the
presidency, I have received a cheque for Dollars 35,000 every second or
third day. I have bought two Mercedes and an ice-cream machine.
'Yes, thanks, Mr Perot,' I said.
'Excellent. I'll call you mid-week.'
And so he did, on Wednesday, catching me at Wimbledon - Centre Court, Row B
 -where my mobile phone started chirruping just as Croatia's Goran
Ivanisevic boomed down his 33rd ace against Mark Woodforde, a plucky little
Aussie.
'Where are you now, boy?' asked Ross Perot.
'Wimbledon,' I whispered, embarrassed by the frigid stares of those to left
and right.
'Who are you watching?'
'Mr Smarty Pants versus Mr Carrot Top.'
'What's the score?'
'The score hardly matters. Every time Mr Carrot Top shows a flicker of
defiance, Mr Smarty Pants shells him with another four aces or bombards him
with astounding cross-court drives.'
'Good,' said Ross Perot. 'It gladdens me when members of my team show a
healthy interest in sport. Just as long as it doesn't interfere with their
duties, or their never-ceasing war against moral laxity. Thankyou for your
position paper on Middle East affairs, boy. You certainly know your stuff.
It has given the Committee To Elect Ross Perot a great deal to chew on. Now
I want something else - to meet Maggie Thatcher. Can you fix a dinner?'
'Why Maggie Thatcher? She's yesterday's potatoes, a sad and bitter woman.'
'You mean something's happened to her?'
'Of course it has,' I said. 'She was removed in a coup. Her successor is
John Major.'
'Jumping rattlesnakes]' said Ross Perot. 'The things I learn from you. I've
never heard of John Major. But then Europe is a mystery to me, boy, along
with Asia, Africa, Morocco, Mongolia, Queensland, New Zealand, South and
Central America and the North and South Poles.'
'Holy Toledo]' I exclaimed.
'What's the matter?' asked my boss.
'Mr Smarty Pants has just cannoned down his 34th ace.'
'Forget the tennis,' roared Ross Perot. 'It's a wimp's game, boy. A game for

FT  27 JUN 92 / As they say in Europe: The Maastricht debate takes a
frivolous turn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JAMES MORGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FRIVOLITY, for the first time in months, if not years, peeps shyly from the
sombre pages of leading European papers. The lightheartedness may have been
partly inspired by the Irish referendum which I knew was going to be awful
because of the succession of ghastly German puns it would inspire. The
trouble is that the German for the Irish is Iren while 'to be mistaken' is
irren. You can imagine the rest, for each German word can have many others
built upon it.
The next referendum is in France where the domestic debate is flagging in
spite of the Versailles Congress which approved the changes needed to
implement the Maastricht Treaty. Liberation performed a sterling service -
several hundred words on how to pronounce the name of the 'little Batavian
city.' (This is a curious French habit, nothing is ever called by what it
is, thus France is always 'the Hexagon.') Nicole Gauthier opened with the
words, 'Tell me how you pronounce 'Maastricht' and I'll tell you who you
are.' It emerges that the Communist leader, Georges Marchais, pronounces it
'Maastriche' which nicely mixes the hated treaty with the verb 'to cheat' -
hence Maastricheries. One trouble is that the most famous of Dumas'
musketeer, d'Artagnan, died at Maastricht, which gives the city a place in
French mythology that it lacks elsewhere. As a result there was a row in the
National Assembly. A UDF deputy from what was once a royalist stronghold,
the Vendee used one pronunciation, a socialist cried, 'Say Maastricht]"
'Je prononce comme il faut]'
'No, in dying on the ramparts of Maastricht, d'Artagnan certainly said
'Maastrisht.' Let us remain French]' said the socialist.
Now in France there is always great searching for the journalistic device
that might be called the Contrived Coincidence, or Puerile Paradox. In
Britain this is seen in sentences such as, 'Although Professor Smith is the
leading authority in Oxford on medieval music, he is also a keen follower of
West Ham United.' In France the coincidence of the Versailles parliamentary
congress and the attempts by farmers to blockade the routes to Paris
provided fertile ground for the provincial press to draw gaudy parallels.
Thus La Republique des Pyrenees contrasted the two phenomena and continued,
'On one side the Jacquerie of peasants revolting against the reform of the
Common Agricultural Policy, on the other, under the gold of the Princes'
Wing, costumed deputies approving the Europe of Maastricht.' Rather lamely,
it had to conclude that this was not a repetition of ancient French revolts.
The peasant problem in France always surprises her neighbours. The image
conjured up in England by the words 'French peasants' is probably of a
cross-eyed crone throttling some poor stuffed goose outside a bucolic hovel
from which her bottled-scarred husband stares malignly through a broken
window pane. In France, however, the vision is Arcadian. I have been
treasuring for some weeks a huge article by Alain Peyrefitte in Le Figaro
entitled, 'Do we want the death of the French peasant?' It was the familiar
'true France' stuff, accusing the government of bowing to Washington in
accepting reform of the CAP. What Peyrefitte called the 'French exception'
was characterised as, 'A harmony, painfully acquired over time, between town
and country, between hi-tech industry and the permanent elements of labour
and pasture, between innovation and respect for tradition.'
It could have been taken from a speech by Marshall Petain, circa 1943, on
the Vichy government's theme of 'Patrie, Famille Travail.' Each nation has
its curious vision of rural life. In Germany it is all mixed up with organic
food and organic societies, building blocks of the nation and the need to
keep in touch with basic values. The Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung reports
that 70 per cent of the German people go for walks in the 'mythic' German
forest quite regularly in search of 'cleansing of the soul.' In Britain an
upper middle class, mummified chintz-and-thatch fantasy peers out from the
carefully crafted pictures in glossy magazines. But at least in Britain few
believe that enormous subsidies are essential for the maintenance of the
rural idyll.
The Italians probably have the right attitude towards the countryside. Rural
life is coming into fashion in Italy because it now seems marginally less
intolerable than life in the cities. And for one nation at least, the
countryside is a gold mine - Ireland gets six times as much from the CAP as
it pays out. Children always vote for Christmas, as an Irish colleague put
it.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Arts: 'Licht' progresses - Stockhausen's 'Dienstag' at the
Holland Festival
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW CLEMENTS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A WEEK can take a long time in opera. In 1977 Karlheinz Stockhausen began
working on his plan for a music-theatre cycle that would be performed over
the days of a week, and to which he gave the overall title of Licht. The
ground plan of the whole scheme was established from the very start, and
everything Stockhausen has composed since then has been related to the
cycle.
Elements of Licht have continued to emerge at regular intervals, both
piecemeal - an act, a scene at a time to fulfil specific commissions - and
then complete day by complete day. Donnerstag aus Licht was the first to be
performed in its entirety, at La Scala in 1981, and Thursday was followed in
1984 by Saturday and in 1988 by Monday, both premieres also taking place
under the auspices of La Scala, though Stockhausen's theatrical ideas have
steadily freed themselves from the constraints of opera-house performance.
Now Tuesday has been completed. The Leipzig Opera House is due to present
the stage premiere of Dienstag aus Licht next year, but the complete score
was given in a semi-staged version in Lisbon last month, and the performance
brought on Thursday to the Holland Festival. It was presented in the space
of the Amsterdam Muziektheater, not in any conventional arrangement, but
with the performers based in the front of the stalls, and the audience
seated on the stage proper and in the vast rear stage area, while performers
swarmed around and among them.
The subject matter and much of the musical material of the Licht cycle are
well established by now. Its story of the archangel Michael (portrayed by a
tenor) and his struggle with the forces of good and evil epitomised by Eva
(soprano) and Luzifer (bass) has a mythic simplicity. There is an
interweaving of elements from various traditions, but the overriding
philosophy mingles utopianism with Stockhausen's very personal brand of
religion which mingles elements of astrology with monotheism; Licht is, he
emphasises, a 'profoundly Christian' work.
Dienstag is very much the mixture as before. It is cast in two large-scale
acts (roughly two and a half hours of music) prefaced by the now standard
'welcome', Dienstags-Gruss. The first act, Der Jahreslauf, shows Luzifer
tempting Michael with all the trappings of the material world, and the
archangel successfully resisting the blandishments; the second, Invasion -
Explosion mit Abschied, is a series of battles between Michael's forces and
those of Luzifer, all brought to an end by a series of three explosions.
It sounds naive, and so it is; Stockhausen's gift for drama, indeed his
whole view of music theatre, has always been a simplistic one, strangely at
odds with the immense sophistication of his music. In a sense that is the
point, for the scenario of Dienstag seems determined by the musical
processes that underpin it rather than vice versa. There are some vivid set
pieces in the score, and the whole of the second act unfolds over a
pre-recorded tape that is as fine and imaginative a piece of electronic
composition as anything Stockhausen has written in a quarter of a century.
In the second act when battle is joined the tenor and bass portraying
Michael and Luzifer roam the auditorium with their troupes of
instrumentalists, trumpet-based for Michael, trombones for Luzifer. As they
prance around gesturing and posturing it looks ludicrous, and dramatically
it is, but the music generated by these confrontations - wild flaring brass,
synthesiser explosions and overlaid on the eight-channel tape - is
extraordinarily vivid and compelling, and through its use of the melodic
formulae that underpin the whole of the cycle, thoroughly coherent.
Some of the episodes are too extended, certainly. In the midst of the
battles there is a Pieta for the soprano Eva and a solo trumpet, Michael's
alter ego, that contains wonderful instrumental writing, and luscious vocal
lines, but it is at least a third too long; Synthi-Fou, the cadenza for
synthesisers inserted just before the final Abschied could profitably be
halved. Such are the work's longueurs; the rest of the second act in
particular is fascinating.
The greeting that opens the first act is a dense meshing of brass and
chorus, to which Eva adds her exhortations, and Der Jahreslauf itself is a
large-scale clockwork, composed in four distinct layers. It was the first
part of Licht to be completed and is already available on disc. The music
seems to me undistinguished (it was originally written for a Japanese Gagaku
ensemble, and was given here in a Westernised version), and the 'windows' in
the textures through which Luzifer tempts Michael offer no real musical
variety let alone dramatic interest.
Even here though the quality and concentration of the performances were
extraordinary. Stockhausen had worked at every detail, and took charge of
the sound projection; the singers and instrumentalists were those with whom
he works regularly, including his sons Markus and Simon who delivered the
trumpet and synthesiser solos with great panache; Julian Pike sang Michael;
Nicholas Isherwood was Luzifer, Annette Meriweather Eva; the Handel
Collegium Keuelen provided the choir. However ridiculous it sometimes
seemed, Dienstag conveys a curious musical power absolutely unlike anything
else.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Arts: Shadow of a Cinderella - Review of the latest English
National Ballet production at the Coliseum
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLEMENT CRISP
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ENGLISH National Ballet's decision to exhume Ben Stevenson's Cinderella is
odd, and not to be justified by the need for yet another safe box-office
title. When the company first acquired the staging in 1973, it was a pallid
and uninteresting thing. Now, somewhat revised, and tricked out with the
fripperies and fidget of David Walker's winsome design, it is even more
unwelcome as a repertory piece.
The shadow of Ashton's version is inevitably cast over this production, for
Stevenson has opted for several of Ashton's decisions about score and
narrative. But Stevenson's choreography looks drily academic, meagre in
feeling, tight and fussy, where Ashton was warm, witty, touching.
Prokofiev's score is surely his greatest for ballet, containing marvels of
melody and rhythmic variety at every turn: its waltzes are as thrilling in
their way as Tchaikovsky's. Stevenson offers dull evolutions that weigh down
Prokofiev's lilt and dramatic pulse, and the great moments - Cinderella's
arrival at the ball; her duet with the Prince and the mounting, fevered
excitements of the final waltz - go for nothing.
And absolutely fatal is Stevenson's decision to continue having the Ugly
Sisters played by men. When Ashton and Helpmann took these roles for the
Royal Ballet, they paid homage to a music hall tradition, but more
importantly, both were consummate drolls, and their foolery was born of a
long friendship and a huge understanding of the jokes implicit in such
impersonations. (Their 'characters' were also lightly based upon two women
they knew). ENB's pair, Maurizio Bellezza and Kevin Richmond, are called
upon to fall about, to flaunt and rampage like rabid drag queens.
Embarrassing and supernally unfunny, they ruin what little sentiment the
narrative possesses.
Other interpretations at the staging's first London showing on Thursday did
little to help matters. Agnes Oaks is a gentle heroine, but she does not yet
have the assurance to triumph over the dull things she is given to do. Jose
Manuel Carreno was her prince, letting off technical fireworks in the
ball-room, but hardly seeming caught up in the drama. The four soloists who
play the Season fairies were not the happiest advocates for the beauties of
classical dancing. The Jester, Stephane Dalle, was technically brilliant,
but it is a role to cute for comfort. The corps de ballet romped through the
ball-room in complicated costumes, as if waiting for the choreography to
arrive. It didn't.
Visually the production is sickly, predictable, and - to my eyes - hideous.
David Walker is adept at dressing a stage with period flummery which
artfully combines the twee and the oh-so-ingratiatingly pretty. This
Cinderella is no exception. It is a triumph of kitsch, and it finds its
apogee in the ballet's finale, which Mr Stevenson has decided must show us
Cinderella and her Prince being married. The scene takes place - how right,
how touching - in a wintry forest. The massed hordes of the corps de ballet
appear from the wings draped in white cloaks, like fugitives from an ice
show. There enter a priest, acolytes and four midget female angels, complete
with wings. (Are we perhaps in heaven, we ask ourselves? Hell, more likely,
answers critical conscience). The hapless pair are married, and the gorge
can rise no further as the curtain falls.
We may have to start fresh Nuremberg trials, for crimes against ballet and
artistic sanity.

<TEXT>
TOMORROW the Heritage Secretary David Mellor will join a sing-in at Clapham
Common, watch marching bands in the Mall, and end the day in Birmingham with
the CBSO. His number two, Robert Key, will be singing a West Country ballad
in Salisbury before moving on to a Jose Carreras concert in Bath.
This is not the usual weekend over-time of our arts supremos. This is their
contribution to National Music Day. It is big of them, really, since the Day
was the inspiration of the previous Arts Minister, Tim Renton, whose work
Mellor is studiously dismantling. Renton had been sold he idea by Mick
Jagger who, in his turn, bought the concept from Jack Lang, the French
Minister of Culture. Jagger will be strutting his stuff tomorrow at the
Hammersmith Odeon while Renton will be ballooning hither and thither before
finally descending on Carreras in Bath.
Compulsory music for all is perhaps more suited to continental taste than
British, but with Pounds 100,000 of Government money and sponsorship by
Carling and Coca-Cola, Music Day is taking a hold on the national
consciousness. In all there will be over 1,500 events, ranging from a
multi-thousand voice rendition of The Messiah at Olympia to a thousand pub
singalongs orchestrated by Carling.
The only part of the arts world playing the Day fairly diminuendo is the
Arts Council. True, its Secretary General Anthony Everitt will be opening a
cornucopia of jazz, blues and busking in his local Essex village of
Wivenhoe, but the chairman of the Council, Lord Palumbo, will be mute. But
then the Arts Council has never liked initiatives that come from alternative
arts bodies.
The management, soloists, chorus and orchestra of the Royal Opera House,
Covent Garden leave all their worries about diminishing audiences,
sponsorship shortfalls and re-development delays behind them next week as
they fly off to Japan to perform three Mozart operas at the Asahi Beer
Festival.
This is the first major overseas tour by the opera company for six years and
is nicely copper bottomed, sponsored by both RTZ and Asahi, and bound to
bring back a profit. It is another example of the first law of arts funding:
if the Government will not provide more money, talk to a Japanese
businessman.
The trip to Japan is timely. The Royal Opera House has just formed a joint
company with Pioneer, the giant electronics company, which will lead to
around 20 Covent Garden productions being retained for posterity on CDV, the
new technique which brings video to the compact disc. The first production
to be recorded is Domingo's Otello in October. It is wonderful for Pioneer,
which is desperately short of desirable products to market alongside its new
equipment, and quite nice for Covent Garden, which in the past has never
quite managed to get the reproduction of its repertoire to work as well as
expected.
Business is getting no better for the dealers in modern art, and in their
idleness all the talk is of the next gallery to go belly up. It is brave,
then, of Bonhams, which has never managed to make much of a mark in this
area, to recruit a bright young expert who will be holding her first auction
on July 16. Claudia Wolfers has the right sort of pedigree. Her father David
runs the New Grafton Gallery and she learned the ropes at Agnew's.
Her main objective has been to put such low estimates on the works on offer
that private collectors will feel silly if they do not start buying again.
For example, 'The Little Brown House' by Christopher Wood carries a low
estimate of Pounds 6,000. It had hung on a dealer's wall for ages priced at
Pounds 14,000.
Around 40 per cent of the lots come from dealers desperate to raise money to
pay off bank overdrafts, including stock from two more galleries which have
recently thrown in the towel - Trinity and Red Square, which specialised in
Russian art. Holding distress sales for dealers seems to be the main growth
area in the auction market.
The two opening lots are paintings by Jack Yeats and Ben Nicholson, both
estimated at around Pounds 30,000. The Nicholson abstract has a nice
history. Its unlikely home since it was painted has been 'Mandalay', the
Cornish house rented by Daphne du Maurier and the atmospheric backdrop to
her novel Rebecca. The Nicholson hardly inspired her - she had tucked it
away face down, an unromantic intrusion of modernism.
I do not know the going rate for a bust of Norman Lamont but I doubt whether
it currently approaches Pounds 800,000. That is the price Sotheby's is
hoping for on Thursday when it offers for sale a sculpture of an Egyptian
chancellor. Senbef was in charge of the accounts around 650 BC and did such
a good job that the Pharoah had a portrait of him modelled and inscribed
'sole beloved companion.'
It is regarded as one of the most sensitive and finely crafted works of
antiquity and if it makes its target will establish a record price for any
Egyptian antique. It will also have proved a good investment. It sold in
1979 for just Pounds 68,000.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Arts: Down Buchan's way - Radio
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BA YOUNG
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ON Wednesday, Radio 4 gave us In Richard Hannay's Footsteps, about the hero
of The Thirty-Nine Steps; and we shall follow his footsteps closer when we
hear an adaptation of that splendid book (published 1915, still selling 7000
copies a year) next Monday.
Presenter Christopher Lambton's first target was the precise location in the
Galloway country where Hannay had his adventures. Writer Frank Lindsay, both
the President and Vice-President of the John Buchan Society and Dr David
Daniel may or may not have found credible places, complete with inn; but
before they reached a prospect of agreement we were discussing Buchan's
personality and comparing it with Hannay's, alleged to be that of a prig and
a racist. It was very pleasant, and ought to be heard again after the Monday
play.
While we were in Buchan mood, we had the rather different Witchwood last
Monday, a product no doubt of the Covenanter, Calvinist personality ascribed
to the author. It is set in 1614, 300 years before 39 Steps, and follows the
fortunes of David Semphill (Paul Young), a young Scottish Presbyterian
minister. It is hard enough that he should fall out with the Presbytery over
the matter of Devil's Sabbaths in the Black Wood, in which some of his
parishioners are active. He is also involved with the defeated soldiers of
Montrose's royalist army, pretty unpopular in those parts.
It is a sad tale in the end - David is excommunicated, his love Katrine
(Gerda Stevenson) dies of the plague, Montrose and his friends go into
exile, even the chief of the devil-worshippers is killed by the devils. John
Scotney's adaptation is excellent, full of atmosphere and truly lively
characters - the ministers Mungo Muirhead and Ebenezer Proudfoot (Robert
Trotter and John Shedden) betray a Buchanesque ministerial hatefulness. The
spry direction is by Alec Reid. You can get cassettes of this and the 39
Steps together in the BBC Radio Collection.
No proper Englishman, only the crowds that resent the Tests on Radio 3,
could fail to offer good wishes to Brian Johnston on his 80th birthday. The
BBC celebrated it on Sunday. They played him on his old ground, Down Your
Way - his way, as it happens, Swanage, about which he was interesting and
where the music was as amiable as Terry Waite's, earlier that day in Desert
Island Discs.
In under a minute, he skipped from Swanage on Radio 4 to Lord's on Radio 3,
and what a good present that was, as exciting a Test as we have had for
years. I can't deny that I had both programmes on together for a bit.
I was disappointed in Radio 5's A Family Learns Spanish (Sunday, again
Tuesday), where Ian and Alison and their four children are coached, not so
much in Spanish, as in how to be taught Spanish. There are four more
programmes to come, and I must hope that learning Spanish is to be given
more time than overheard home chat.
Another family lurks on Radio 5, in It's My Life by Robert Leeson, which
began last week. Sixteen-year-old Janice (Jane Hazelgrove) has a mother who
has bolted, a boy-friend who may have lost interest, a little brother who
interrupts, and a Dad who tries to sort his family out when he can spare the
time from his work. Jan says things like 'bloody 'ell]' (it goes out at 9.30
pm). This sorts out her class; but she might have gone to university if she
hadn't had to take a job to keep the family. Her Life sounds like the small
paras in the local paper.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Arts: Brief encounter with Delft - William Packer enjoys
Vermeer and de Hooch at the National Gallery
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM PACKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BRIEF ENCOUNTERS is a series of occasional exhibitions at the National
Gallery founded on a principle so simple, elegant and obvious, that we can
only wonder it has not been a commonplace of public gallery practice since
public galleries began. A loan from another great collection is requested or
becomes available, whereupon a comparable or related work from the Gallery's
permanent collection is set against it and a small explicatory display
arranged around the pair.
This current encounter brings together the 'Street in Delft' of circa 1659,
from the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, one of only two surviving townscapes by
that rarest of painters, Jan Vermeer, and the National Gallery's own
'Courtyard of a House in Delft', of 1658, by Pieter de Hooch. The mutual
context is further established by two more paintings from the collection:
the tiny 'View of Delft', of 1652, by Carel Fabritius; and Egbert van der
Poel's 'View of Delft after the Explosion of 1654', in which disaster
Fabritius was killed. Thus is set out something of the nature of
topographical realist painting at a most crucial stage in its development,
albeit within the brief scope of four small, exquisite works made in one
small city within one short decade.
De Hooch, born in 1629, was three years older than Vermeer. In 1652 he moved
from Haarlem, where he had trained, to Delft, where Vermeer had been born,
and it is not unreasonable to suppose that by the late 1650s, with both of
them in their late twenties, there was at least some familiarity between the
two men. Yet for all the consonance of interest in their subject-matter, and
the apparent similarities of meticulous observation and pains-taking
technique, the real differences between them are profound.
Both painters present the image and the pictorial space four-square, as upon
a stage, a facade or screen laid flat across the canvas. And both of them
pierce this screen selectively, opening up now a deeper, now a more shallow
space, near and far. But where De Hooch brings the viewer in much closer to
his subject, and is much more particular in the characterisation of his
principal figures that animate the scene, Vermeer remains remote, detached
and not a little mysterious. His facade remains in part impenetrable, the
windows shuttered, the arched door firmly closed, the alley blocked at its
far end, even the interior impossible to penetrate beyond the faceless woman
sewing at the open door.
As for the detail and the handling, the similarities are apparent only to
deceive. Where de Hooch marks every brick and paving-stone, Vermeer's bricks
and cobbles, shutters and window lattices are miracles of generalised
suggestion. It is not that the de Hooch is not fresh and painterly in the
handling, but that Vermeer is so much the fresher, and so painterly as to
prefigure a much later age - Degas, Whistler, Sickert. The radical nature of
his design in the passage across the ground floor of the street-front - the
indian red and green blocks of the shutters, the black of the open door and
the closed arch, all set against the bright white of the plaster - comes
close indeed to the abstract preoccupations of Whistler or William
Nicholson, hints even at Mondrian.
So convincing are both paintings in the architectural spaces they propose,
both open and solid, that the use of the camera obscura, evident in the
forced monocular perspective of the tiny Fabritius, has been mooted as an
enabling device. There are, however, certain awkwardnesses and
inconsistencies of perspective in both paintings that make this unlikely,
more obvious in the de Hooch, more surprising, perhaps, in the Vermeer, in
which the eye-levels and vanishing-points simply do not match up. The
figures, too, are relatively too small to make literal sense.
Yet it is the magic of painting, that eye and hand must ever accommodate to
a binocular vision and a shifting perception of reality. It was never a
literal exercise, more a question of making true sense, which is to say what
is truly felt and intuitively understood. Even the Fabritius is transformed
by a unique sensibility into an elegiac image, poetical and infinitely
strange. The dreamer sits outside the inn in the evening sunshine, the
mother brings her child in from the garden, the old woman sits sewing at her
door as the children play outside. It might have been yesterday. Life goes
on.

A BONE FROM A DRY SEA
by Peter Dickinson
Gollancz Pounds 10.99, 192 pages
PUBLISHERS, parents and children alike have difficulty in knowing where
childhood ends and adulthood begins. For the child, it is a time of acute
existential uncertainty; to the publisher of books for children, it is
experienced as a problem of marketing strategy that can be summarised as
follows. At some point between the age of about ten (when many children are
still unselfconsciously voracious readers) and twelve, the desire to read is
often replaced by a yearning to do almost anything but read. The business of
living and self-discovery assumes an almost overwhelming importance; action
succeeds contemplation. And bookishness becomes for many an embarrassment,
an impediment to social advancement.
How does a publisher deal with these in-between-age-children who are no
longer children, adults-in-the-making who are not yet adults? Being human,
they fudge, and hope for the best.
One solution, however, has persisted. Twenty years ago, the Bodley Head
created a special new category of books for this age-group, YA (Young
Adults), and this uneasy, partially satisfactory description has survived to
this day, in spite of the fact that it smacks of condescension and that no
young person would ever admit to belonging to such a group. Why should they?
They are not, in their own opinion, 'in between' anything; they are merely
their own difficult, moody, tortured selves who, from time to time, try to
knock some sense into the frustrating and hopelessly outmoded imbeciles who
still hold partial sway over their lives.
Yet the problem is a real one . There does indeed come a point when the
familiar subject matters of books for children have been outgrown; but the
reader's experience of life and understanding of language makes him or her
unready for the fully fledged adult novel. So YA has its uses.
Amongst the finest in this category of novelists is Peter Dickinson, who has
published almost 20 titles in as many years with Victor Gollancz, ranging
from his early experiments in science fiction and fantasy to this month's
absorbing mixture of archaeology and pre-history, A Bone from a Dry Sea.
Dickinson succeeds where many others fail, precisely because he combines a
forceful simplicity of language with just the right level of complexity of
ideas to make his novels absorbing and intellectually challenging.
The narrative consists of two elements which alternate: the world of an
archaeological dig in the present and the world of pre-history four million
years ago - or 'then' and 'now,' as the chapters are labelled. The novel's
time-span in the present is surprisingly short - just a few days; in the
past, it seems to stretch back and away into infinity, giving a pleasing
sense throughout of sudden changes of pace.
The past is pure conjecture in which Dickinson is staring through lenses of
time 'right at the edge of imagination's eyesight,' as he puts it. He
imagines the existence of a tribe of African hominids, one of whom, a young
female called Li, is slowly beginning to emerge into a surprising degree of
self-awareness. She is a questor, a problem-solver, a creature who needs to
push herself to the furthest intellectual limits - for the sake of the
acquisition of knowledge alone. Is there something uniquely human about
that? If so, she must be numbered amongst our ancestors.
By staring at a spider setting its trap, she learns the rudiments of fishing
 -how to fashion the crudest of nets from gourd-fibre. Hers is a strange,
marvellous world, whose hugeness and otherness are gradually becoming
intellectually apparent.
In the time-span of the present, a team of archaeologists is searching and
sifting that same portion of pitiless African terrain for remains of - a
tribe of hominids? They hope so, in order to establish their world-wide
importance as a team of discoverers. These two worlds swim apart and come
together again, the one illuminating the other in details large and small.
This is a challenging, positive novel, which will be enjoyed by all
intelligent homines sapientes of twelve and above. Positive? Of course. If
you write under the banner of YA, nihilism must be avoided at all costs -
lest the senior librarian accuse you of corrupting youth by piling
depression upon depression.

KLEZMER MUSIC, the Jewish music of Eastern Europe, played a key influence in
the development of jazz but was itself long ago taken for dead. Now,
however, it is in the throes of an improbable revival in both Britain and
abroad.
Giora Feidman was 13 when he played his first professional engagement by
accompanying his father in the klezmer band performing at a Jewish wedding
in his native Argentina - the fourth generation of his family to take up
klezmer. Forty-three years on and Feidman is known as the 'King of Klezmer'
and the leading figure in an extraordinary international boom of interest in
this a form of music until recently taken for dead. He has been in Britain
to launch the four-week Jewish Music Festival, which started this week.
Bands of klezmorim used to travel to Jewish settlements of Poland, the
Ukraine and Romania to play at weddings and other festivities. Klezmer music
was dance music and the arrival of the klezmorim in town meant that the good
times were about to roll. Jews, along with Gypsies, were the most active
musicians in Eastern Europe.
The klezmer boom has now hit Britain. Giora Feidman, now based in New York,
played at the Barbican last Tuesday and plays in Glasgow tomorrow and BBC2
screened Fiddler on the Hoof, a documentary telling the story of klezmer
from its roots in the Old World through its development in the New.
Meanwhile, the Klezmer Festival Band, Britain's first professional ensemble,
plays in Weybridge tomorrow.
A simple definition of klezmer seems elusive. Some call it Jewish gypsy
music; others simply Jewish jazz. 'It's Jewish good-time music', offers
Simon Broughton, producer of the BBC documentary. 'It's wild and crazy. But
it can also be deep and soulful.'
Though its roots are considerably older, what would today be recognised as
klezmer probably dates from the early 18th century. The distinctive flavour
of klezmer stems from its unusual combination of musical sources. It blends
traces of Middle-Eastern music with elements of Jewish liturgical chant,
along with musical influences from the Balkans, Hungary, Poland, Russia and
wherever else the Jews settled. The main klezmer instruments are violin and
clarinet, largely because they were the most portable.
The wave of Jewish immigration to America since the end of the last century
brought klezmer with it. But the next generation of American Jews wanted the
music of the New World, not the Old, so klezmer players got sucked into
jazz, where many went on to become big-name soloists. Early Benny Goodman is
hardly distinguishable from klezmer, while George Gershwin's music, which is
the subject of Feidman's Glasgow concert, owes an almost equal debt.
Klezmer in America eventually gave up the unequal survival battle against
jazz. The Holocaust then wiped out the Jewish communities and hence
klezmorim of Eastern Europe, while the Soviet Union strove to suppress
Jewish culture and music. Klezmer became the lost music of a lost world.
Or so it seemed, until around the mid-1970s, when two factors sparked what
has been called the great klezmer explosion. The first was Feidman's
decision to quit his job as lead clarinettist of the Israeli Philharmonic to
dedicate himself to klezmer. The second was the efforts of two young
American Jews who unearthed some old 78s, transcribed the music and formed a
band to play it. Old people loved it. Young people loved it even more. There
are now some 100 bands in America.
and Klezmer is not merely a Jewish cult. Bands have also been formed by the
likes of Don Byron, a black New Yorker and top jazz clarinettist. And they
play to mainstream audiences at venues like Carnegie Hall.
The early efforts of the American klezmer enthusiasts was simply to
reconstruct klezmer music. The emphasis has now moved on from reviving to
developing it. Thus, nine of the 15 songs on Feidman's newt album are new
and written specially for him, including one by a Palestinian composer.
Klezmer is taking off in new directions.

WHAT TO do with The Beggar's Opera? It had a triumphant first performance in
1728, and a no less triumphant modern revival (the famous Hammersmith
performances) in 1920; at least since the latter date, it has seldom been
absent from the stages of the English-speaking world. This year in Britain
alone, there has been a new RSC production at Stratford, an Aldeburgh
Festival concert performance of Britten's radical re-working, and, alongside
those, a new Hyperion recording setting out to catch the 'ballad opera' as
nearly as possible in its original form.
The attractions of the work - an English opera-comique simultaneously
sending up the Italian opera seria then so popular in London and depicting
the morals and manners of the city's underworld at the time - seem undying.
The string of popular numbers (folk tunes and dances, airs by composers like
Purcell, Handel and Bononcini) that Pepusch set down in music and Gay
re-worded to fit the dramatic scheme maintain their appeal.
And yet the whole so rarely manifests the cutting edge one knows it to
possess. As I remarked the other day while reviewing the Opera North Orpheus
in the Underworld, a perennial problem crops up in the revival of popular
music-theatre works of genius whose satire is, paradoxically, universal and
tied to a specific place and time: that is, the problem of maintaining the
sting of the social criticism when the local-colour references of those
works - if not their targets - have lost their immediacy of recognition.
Since the time of the Hammersmith revival, the most favoured method of
treating The Beggar's Opera has been to practise various forms of musical
re-working upon it. Some attempts (Frederic Austin's in 1920, Britten's in
1948) have had at least the 'relevance' of particular performers and
performing circumstances to justify them; others (the sludgy Guy Woolfenden
edition for Scottish Opera and the gruesomely over-scored Bonynge recording
for Decca, with James Morris and the Dames Joan and Kiri, both 1981) have
been so overlaid with the rearranger's arts and artifices as to leave the
original unrecognisable.
The new recording proposes a period-conscious, 'back to Gay-Pepusch'
rationale: as its editor and musical director Jeremy Barlow notes in the
booklet, Pepusch's arrangements have been adhered to - in terms of key
signature, vocal range and likely instrumental support (strings, oboe,
bassoon harp) - as closely as possible. The dialogue is given in full; the
singers speak it. There are no bedizenings to the vocal lines apart from
touches of ornament. The style is intimate, unforced.
With Bob Hoskins declaiming the Beggar's introduction and envoy to the final
scene in his inimitable cockney tones, the performance starts off with high
promise. It is when the main cast take over - Adrian Thompson as Macheath,
Charles Daniels and Sarah Walker as the Peachums, Bronwen Mills as Polly,
Richard Jackson as Lockit, Anne Dawson as Lucy - that difficulties begin.
Almost all the low-life accents sound fearfully creaky and quaint; and
though the air-singing is neat and often attractive - Miss Mills, an
underrated and under-used soprano, is particularly welcome on records - the
smell and feel of theatre seem light years away. Gay planned the work for
actors who could sing; a reverse formula has been used by Mr Barlow, and its
bite is lost. This remains a recording of interest and value, worth
investigating; but it is not the Beggar's Opera revelation for which I've
been waiting.
Handel, whose London Italian operas Gay parodied, and whose hold on the
London public was directly affected by the success of The Beggar's Opera,
has a slew of new Italian-opera recordings, all in 'period' style, to
correct the historical balance. The best of the bunch is the early
Agrippina, a triumph of the composer's Venetian sojourn, whose mix of
historical characters and Cavalli-like comic intricacy comes up in McGegan's
performance with delicious freshness. He paces it expertly, and his cast -
led by Sally Bradshaw in the title role, the countertenor Drew Minter (Otho)
and the sopranos Lisa Saffer (Poppaea) and Wendy Hill (Nero) - catch its
light, sophisticated tone with captivating deftness. Only a single weakness,
the woofy low-bass Claudius, mars the impression.
The new Giulio Cesare - most popular and most recorded of all Handel operas
 -has already been widely acclaimed. I do not entirely subscribe to the
enthusiasm. The singing, particularly by the ravishing Jennifer Larmore
(title role) and sumptuous Bernarda Fink (Cornelia), is among the best
modern Handel performance has to offer; but Jacobs's sometimes leadenly slow
tempos (how very odd of a singer-conductor to adopt them]) try our patience
sorely. Rodelinda, one of the supreme London masterpieces, simply needs
better singing that it receives from the all-too-modest Frankfurt-based
recording. Only Barbara Schlick in the title role - she is also Jacobs's
Cleopatra - emerges with any credit.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Arts: Closet drama Romeo
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW ST GEORGE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE ROYAL Shakespeare Company's Romeo &amp; Juliet has transferred from
Stratford-upon-Avon to the Barbican. David Leveaux' fine 1991 Stratford
version was the most sombre of the RSC's five stagings of the play since
1980. A compelling closet drama emerged, trusting to the play's text. It has
matured, improved, and now is even better. It makes exciting and intense
drama.
Shakespeare wrote Romeo in 1595. At 31 he balanced the play's issues deftly:
love, adolescence, parents, suicide, the claims of faction and the desires
of heart. Because the characters are always searching for newer, bolder
images, Romeo sits closer to the Sonnets than any other play. Its language
has a heady amplitude. This production recognises that: every phrase is
new-minted and made for the occasion, and supported by consistently fine
verse speaking.
Alison Chitty's set, a shadowy interior of panelled frescoes, is more
brightly lit (Alan Burrett) than at Stratford. The action becomes more
vivid, pushed forward on stage in the shallower Barbican auditorium. Beyond
the curtained and crepuscular chambers lies the brightly lit 'public haunt
of men", the daytime venue for Verona's brawling families.
Michael Maloney fills out Romeo wonderfully, every gesture a study and every
line a thought: the quintessence of 'drivelling love' and 'violent
delights.' Clare Holman as Juliet finds the wisdom which makes her more
mature than Romeo; her fine performance has greater scope than last year.
The balcony scene, all heartbeat and hesitation, is a delight.
Capulet (Jonathan Newth) is a violent father to Juliet and Mercutio (Tim
McInnerny) a violent friend to Romeo. McInnerny brilliantly turns 'Queen
Mab' into a psychosis, and jokes his way out of life: 'you shall find me a
grave man.' Dryden was right: Shakespeare killed off Mercutio 'lest he
should have been killed by him.'
This fresh, energetic production offers Romeo as a brawling diversity
unified not so much by plot or characters as by sentiment. Its pleasures are
transient: 'like the lightning which doth cease to be ere one can say it
lightens.'

THE MEAT EATERS by Michael Collins Jonathan Cape Pounds 13.99, 279 pages
'YOUR stories are like exquisite cut-glass bottles with all the scents of
life in them,' Gorky once wrote to Chekhov. The comparison was apt.
Combining a finely chiselled structure with the impressionistic ability to
distill all the subtleties of character and situation into 20 or 30 pages,
great short stories have a crystalline perfection that the broader
brushstrokes of the novel completely miss.
But the fiction market in Britain seems strangely unappreciative. There is
not much of a forum for single stories in broad circulation publications.
Tony Lacey, publishing director at Penguin, admits that multiple-author
anthologies of tried and tested stories do well: 'But with a new writer, a
first novel is far more appealing than a book of short stories.'
Bill Hamilton, at one of the oldest-established literary agencies, AM Heath,
suspects that publishers and readers share a misplaced snobbery: 'Novels are
weighty, and people often mistake quantity for quality. There's also the
perception that English literature, unlike Russian, has no short story
tradition.' Dostoyevsky's wonderful description of the birth of Russian
prose fiction - 'we have all come from under Gogol's Overcoat' - puts the
genre right at the centre. But in England, the short story has been more of
a poor relation, intimidated by its big brother, the novel. Among
contemporary classics in English, Nadine Gordimer (South African) and
William Trevor (Irish) come most easily to mind.
Russian, Sri Lankan, American and Irish, these four volumes, three of them
by new writers, seem to reinforce the idea that short stories are a
non-English phenomenon. They all use the medium to explore questions of
cultural identity. But stylistically, each response to the space confines of
the genre is highly individual.
It is the Sri Lankan writer, Romesh Gunesekera, who gets closest to Chekhov
in tone. Given limited space, his writing works by implication, making words
and images mean more than they actually say but without making them
portentously symbolic. Superficially unambitious, the stories in Monkfish
Moon focus on individuals rather than grappling hand-to-hand with big
issues. But they achieve real emotional depth.
One of the best, 'Captives', is beautifully structured around an English
couple's two-day stay in a Sri Lankan hotel. Half-formed thoughts and
suppressed feelings are conveyed with oblique precision. When the hotel
owner notices the woman looking at a vase of lilies, he is suddenly
embarrassed - the stamens look obscene - which says more about his own
unacknowledged sexual longings than about the flowers. No descriptive detail
in these sympathetic stories is superfluous. And the characters are real,
living, breathing people.
In contrast, Tatyana Tolstaya (in her second collection of stories,
Sleepwalker in the Fog) is more theatrical. Not content to allow everyday
objects to take on metaphorical significance without pointing it out, her
stories are bursting at the seams with feverish, highly-charged language.
Written in English, her stories are all set in Russia. And the impact of her
literary inheritance is splintered. The lonely bore from the sanatorium
whose friends turn against him has something of Chekhov. But another story -
about childhood memory and lost love - strains towards Turgenev's lyrical
nostalgia. Yet another - with its blinding vision of a misanthropic angel -
recalls Dostoyevsky's surrealism. But whatever the style, Tolstaya gives the
impression of a passionate ventriloquist, forcing the mouths of her
characters rather than simply giving them the space to speak for themselves.
If Tolstaya's writing is packed with emotive imagery, Pinckney Benedict
strips his sentences down to the bare minimum. His theme, in The Wrecking
Yard, is rural America. But, too spare to be comfortably naturalistic, his
style works best in stories which seem to be hankering after some
inexpressible, mythic truth.
In the last story, 'Odom', an old man at the margins of society is battling
against nature. We see him cinematically, dynamiting trees, drilling into
rocks. The detailed, slow-motion description of his destructive tools takes
on a curious, pregnant intensity. But we are never invited to enter his
mind. Alienation rather than empathy is what Benedict achieves at the end of
the day. But if the larger meaning remains opaque, the writing is
preternaturally clear.
After this laconicism, Michael Collins' The Meat Eaters is bewilderingly
wordy. All concerned with Ireland, his nightmarish stories assault you with
horrendous images - the girl with a bomb in the stomach of her plastic doll;
the mute child sexually abused by Old Mickeline, 'the man who dreamed of
lobsters'; the dead baby in a drawer. But there are too many adjectives, too
many digressions, and not enough focus. The secret of the short story is
selection.

BLACK DOGS
by Ian McEwan
Jonathan Cape Pounds 13.99, 176 pages
ULVERTON
by Adam Thorpe
Secker &amp; Warburg Pounds 14.99, 384 pages
THERE'S something deeply troubling about Ian McEwan's fiction. Not simply in
the stories themselves, though their plotting and careful quota of shocks
certainly find their targets, but in the selection of the subject matter,
the means imported to achieve those contrived discomfitures. McEwan may be
attacked by feminists for what they perceive as the misogyny deep-rooted in
his books, but such use and misuse of women is just one element in his
personal pantheon of disgust, alongside the mistrust of family, sex,
relationships, political beliefs.
That there is a strong suspicion McEwan is not really like that, and all the
misanthropy is thoroughly feigned, only intensifies the mistrust generated
by his fictions. What still seems the most heartfelt and genuinely affecting
of his published prose is the lengthy preface he wrote to his libretto for
Michael Berkeley's anti-nuclear oratorio Or Shall We Die? There nothing had
to be feigned; the fear that he evoked was genuine, and the images in which
it was couched and through which it was related to the writer's own life,
were truthful, telling ones. Without being expected to assume a fictional
mask McEwan could expiate his own terrors with a humanity that gave depth
and potency.
Perhaps though McEwan really does hate dogs, especially big black ones, and
can detect in them the potential that provides the central image of evil in
his new novel. To give its details away, even in as coy and vaguely
lubricious way as McEwan eventually does, would destroy the final point of
reading Black Dogs. Or, just perhaps, he hit upon the idea of the horrifying
revelation as a means of giving point and dramatic focus to a tale that
would otherwise come across as a tired, commonplace dissection of a failed
marriage.
June and Bernard Tremaine are former communists whose loss of faith
immediately after the Second World War took their lives in entirely opposite
directions. He settles into cosy radicalism, writes a biography of Nasser,
makes a career as a television pundit and ends up as a Labour MP. She,
entirely as a result of her encounter with the evil of the black dogs,
embraces God and the truth of mystical experience, goes to live in Provence,
and becomes a recognised authority on matters spiritual.
Their twin stories are relayed through a son-in-law, who offers a brief
cameo of his own predictably troubled upbringing in a preface. The events of
the marriage emerge in a series of episodes moving back and forth through 40
years and finding their biggest set pieces in newly liberated France and the
breaching of the Berlin Wall in 1990. Even when the big evils - Fascism,
Communism - are conquered, it seems to say, the black dogs stay with us,
whether lodged in the German skinheads of West Berlin or in a father
viciously beating his child. But if McEwan's grip on those thematic threads
falters it is largely because his main axis, the Tremaine marriage, is so
schematically portrayed.
The artfulness of Adam Thorpe's novel - his first, after two much praised
volumes of poetry - is paraded very obviously on its surface: Ulverton seems
to be designer fiction of the most egregious kind, Thomas Hardy recast for
the post-modern sensibility. Its vignettes span four centuries in a small
community in deepest Wessex, from the Civil War to the bright, brittle world
of 1988. There is much self-conscious pastiche - of Zummerzet dialogue,
18th-century epistolary style, 19th-century stream of consciousness,
20th-century television script.
Beneath all the posturing, however, the prose seems totally inert; an
anodyne rural idyll with little narrative content is tricked out with a few
convolutions and inversions. Well before the end one longs for an excess of
McEwan-style wickedness to save the whole contraption from itself.

WARRIORS' WORDS

IF GEORGE MacDonald Fraser ever admitted to being aware of the term
'politically correct' he would no doubt consign it to the mouth of one of
the more repellant villains of his highly popular Flashman novels. After
writing about many fictional battles, MacDonald Fraser has now turned to his
own, rather grimmer, military days as a squaddie fighting the Japanese in
Burma in the last days of the Second World War.
On one level it is a brilliantly entertaining read, with all the narrative
power, gift for dialogue and surprising twists and turns that would be
expected of Flashman's creator. But it is also a fine example of a crusty
old conservatism whose days must sadly be numbered. MacDonald Fraser grew to
hate the Japanese and cannot bring himself to forget or forgive.
MacDonald Fraser feels himself to be out of tune with contemporary society,
particularly in its attitudes towards war. But he may be wrong. Certainly
readers are likely to relish the warmth with which he writes of the courage
of the men in his squad - Grandarse, far too fat for jungle warfare; Nixon,
forever saying 'we'll all get killed'; Duke, ex-public schoolboy who served
in the ranks out of laziness as much as anything; Forster, always scrounging
fags and hating everyone, especially Duke, but whose furious anger over
Duke's death knew no bounds; and Corporal Little, the perfect type of
instinctive man manager without which the British army would collapse.
MacDonald Fraser is unrivalled at the story-teller's essential crafts,
characterisation, dialogue and scene-setting. By one of those typical army
cock-ups he becomes a pseudo-expert in the handling of the Piat, a portable
anti-tank weapon, without ever having fired it. At one point he is commanded
to head into the jungle with a Piat and bombs, to instruct a unit in its
handling. He discovers that the unit's leader - Captain Grief - is
completely round the bend. One of Grief's first questions is 'Are you a
lurkin' firkin or a peepin' gremlin?' After helping massacre a Japanese boat
party Grief decides what MacDonald Fraser is: 'the murder's out - evil
weevil written all over you]'
Sprinkled throughout are curmudgeonly views on the effeteness of
contemporary society and the notion that all war crimes are equal. It is a
robust book which challenges many received ideas about guilt, virtue and
combat; it is also hilariously funny and profoundly moving.
As an anthology of writings on war and battle, Echoes of War is oddly
unsatisfying, with too much not very good poetry and some peculiar
omissions. How can the section on the Napoleonic wars not have something
from War and Peace, for example?
But then, as we may read in Warriors' Words, a vast collection of thoughts
from the military mind up to and including Stormin' Norman Schwarzkopf, the
Duke of Wellington's view was, 'If you want anything done well, do it
yourself.' One for every old small boy who can comfortably agree with
Tactitus that 'the desire for glory clings to men even longer than any other
passion.'

THE ORIGINS OF THE SACRED
by Dudley Young
Little, Brown Pounds 16.99, 378 pages
DANCING and poetry, religion and science, all are attempts at interpretation
of the world and our place in it. By telling ourselves stories we lay claim
to a place in the otherwise limitless seas of time and darkness that
surround us.
Our species has forgotten much as it has grown remoter from the natural
world which gave these myths their point; and it has learned much which has
nothing to do with ancient realities, but instead concerns new facts of life
forged by urban civilisation and its intricate technologies. What we have
learned has not always replaced what we have forgotten, so although
humankind has grown cleverer over time, it has not grown wiser.
Dudley Young's book is an attempt to recapture some of what has been
forgotten. There is need for just such a study of our self-interpretations
through history, especially of myth because of its peculiar power to
encapsulate universals of experience. Myth resonates in popular literature
and, inarticulately, in general consciousness; Superman is Heracles with
Hermes' sandals, and when we struggle with anxiety we are Theseus in the
Minotaur's maze. A synoptic study of these origins, drawing also on
linguistics, anthropology and evolutionary theory, would shed extraordinary
light, and give us the insight into our beginnings which is essential to
self-knowledge.
It is a bold scholar, and one possessing an unusual apparatus of skills, who
would risk the attempt to traverse and unite academic specialisms in this
way. Young has taken that risk. His central thesis is that humankind is in
spiritual confusion because it has lost touch with the sacred, which itself
originated in our need to manage dangerous instincts of sex and violence.
The resulting damage is everywhere apparent, Young says, and stems chiefly
from science, which has suppressed our religious nature and polluted the
world. And he proposes (following Freud) that the founding experience of our
now-lost sacredness was a violent patricidal episode which occurred in a
dance; the alpha male was killed and eaten by the troop, and in consequence
'lawlines' of ritual had to be evolved to contain and interpret this horrid
originating act. Young ranges wide through many fields of enquiry to
elaborate this theory.
What Young attempts - a conceptual archaeology of myth and language in
search of our earliest self-interpretations as humans - is a valuable task.
But both his attempt and his results are profoundly unsatisfactory. There is
an interesting thin book, and a more circumspect one, trying to get out of
this fat one; but Young is too intoxicated by verbal pyrotechnics, clever
phrases and slick generalisations to stop himself from overflowing
constantly into absurd claims, so the book begins in self-indulgence and
grows more fanciful. It contains much ignorant hostility to science, and
much dubious and sometimes ridiculous play with etymologies. Young is out of
his depth in several seas at once; and thereby shows that if one tries the
intellectual equivalent of walking on water, one only succeeds in skimming
the surface.
One of Young's main problems is his premiss that sex and violence are
essentially connected. He even makes the serious mistake of equating 'sex
and violence' with 'love and war'. It is uniquely human to connect some
aspects of love with sex; since nothing elsewhere in nature parallels it we
can learn nothing from nature about it. Yet Young succumbs to the mistaken
cliche of modelling human behaviour in these respects on monkey and ape
reproduction. And war is not the cognate, simply writ large, of violence
perpetrated by individual animals on occasions of mating, feeding or general
irritation, but something far more calculated and social.
But his worst mistake is to connect sex with violence at all.
'Sex-and-violence' is a film-censor's artefact of the 20th century. Sex is
not intrinsically violent, except in certain aberrant cases, and there is
nothing intrinsically sexy about violence, except for some aberrant
individuals. Fear of starving seems a more likely explanation for man's
elaborate appeasements of the gods than the implausible claim that sexual
coupling is analogised by the violent act of stabbing. Why 'stabbing'? Why
not meeting, fitting, joining, blending? In certain African languages the
euphemism for sexual intercourse is 'laughing together'. This hardly
contains the murderous suggestions Young finds attractive. Macho images of
thrusting and spearing seem more like adolescent masturbatory frustrations
than reflections of genuine sexual experience, and therefore constitute a
poor basis for a theory of human development. Here, as in too many places
elsewhere, Young carries himself away.
The book - judicious, careful and imaginative - which effects an archaeology
of our myths and paroles, and so helps to tell us who we truly are, still
waits to be written. Young has shown us that it remains overdue.

THE BYROM COLLECTION
by Joy Hancox
Jonathan Cape Pounds 25, 320 pages
THIS BOOK is the interim result of one woman's fascination with an
18th-century character called John Byrom: closet Jacobite, pioneer of
Pitman's shorthand, Fellow of the Royal Society - and curator of a corpus of
over 500 rather similar and rather perplexing drawings. Joy Hancox is
writing Byrom's life: here she describes the drawings.
Put aside the publisher's hyperbole. Put aside, too, the first-person
discourse of intrigue in which the description is couched. You are left with
a piecemeal catalogue, the contents of which are more or less interesting
according to taste. The drawings date across two centuries, and their
superficial homogeneity is in their geometric nature - complexes of circles,
triangles, cubes and squares - but within these patterns there are
intimations of Judaeo-Christian cabbala, Freemasonry, the occult, methods of
defence and navigation, and architectural design.
The limits of enlightenment are soon reached. Byrom was evidently one of
those types obsessed with the cryptic almost for the cryptic's sake, though
he was wise to keep his Jacobite sympathies quiet. He formed a 'Cabbala
Club', whose members included Sir Hans Sloane, but whose functions remain
necessarily obscure. He left no documentation with his collection of
drawings: how they came to be assembled, and what unites them as an
assemblage, are richly speculative questions. The only clues Byrom provided
came from ciphers in his own abbreviated shorthand.
The sleuthing has plainly been fun for the author, even if it fails to add
up to a proper denouement. Where the drawings are likely to arouse most
interest is in their apparent allusion to the early theatres of London. It
used to be assumed that the Elizabethan play-house evolved out of
bear-gardens and cock-pits. Those who like their Shakespeare to be a man of
the people have always resisted the alternative suggestion that it was the
English discovery of the works of Vitruvius - architectural adviser to the
Emperor Augustus - which gave rise to Shakespeare's 'wooden O', and the
Burbage family's first London theatres. Vitruvius outlined a ground plan
whose basis was a circle containing four equilateral triangles: and this is
the basis for a number of drawings in the Byrom Collection, some of them
even annotated with mention of a 'Globe.'
Are these plans of Shakespeare's Globe of 1599? If so, the Globe, with its
pennant declaring it to be theatrum mundi ('All the world's a stage . . .'),
is as architecturally germane to the English Renaissance as the works of its
chief playwright are in a literary sense. There is a drawing of the Rose
Theatre in the Byrom Collection which corresponds closely with what
archaeologists have uncovered there. What correspondence may exist between
the Vitruvian Globe of the Byrom Collection and the yet unexcavated Globe
remains to be seen.

FIRE FROM HEAVEN: LIFE IN AN ENGLISH TOWN IN THE 17TH CENTURY
by David Underdown
Harper Collins Pounds 17.99, 308 pages
A GOOD historian must be something of a magician to transform the very dry
bones of local records into a readable and enlightening account of the
interplay of historical forces - economic, constitutional and, above all,
religious - in the remote setting of a West of England market town,
Dorchester. Perhaps Professor Underwood is a little luckier than most.
Although there are large gaps in many of his records, he has struck two
goldmines which give a richness to this book which it might so easily have
lacked - The Offenders Book that runs from 1629 to 1637, and the diary from
1618 to 1635 and the Commonplace Book of William Whiteway, an affluent,
well-educated townsman with a compulsion to record his life and times. No
Pepys certainly - but a treasure for Underwood.
And of course, Underwood did not pick Dorchester at random. In the early
17th century Dorchester fell under the spell of its puritan preachers and so
reflected the religious and constitutional crises that were imperilling
England's ancient constitution.
In 1613 Dorchester was razed by fire: the churches and the Shire Hall and a
few stone houses survived. Such fires were not uncommon in English towns as
most families lived in wooden, thatched shacks that were little better than
tinder. But for John White, the Minister of Holy Trinity and his ardent
supporters, secular as well as clerical, the Hand of God was clearly to be
discerned in the disaster. Obviously He demanded more discipline, greater
reformation.
White had come from New College in 1605, a reformer of souls who could 'wind
up' a congregation as high as he wished. He was a Calvinist, intent on
turning Dorchester into a New Jerusalem. He believed in discipline, in
exterminating sin, in the Devil who had to be rooted out, but he was also
compassionate, keen on education (he started the Free Schools) and squeezed
astonishing amounts out of his parishioners for charity. He was no
firebrand. Calvinist he might be, but he wore the surplice, accepted the
cross in baptism, and so remained just within the Laudian Church. And for
him kingship was God-given, as was, indeed, all authority and so must be
obeyed.
Authority had obligations - to create a harmonious community, based on God's
Word - best achieved not only by prayer and fasting but by education and
charity; succour for the victims of the harsher life of 17th century England
was high on his agenda. Under his guidance, Dorchester became a model of
godly benevolence. But its success depended on constant vigilance. White,
his friends, his bailiffs and constables battled against Satan who, as
Professor Underwood discovered from the Offender's Book, was at large in
Dorchester.
Boys spat and 'pinged' each other in Church, grew randy out of it, got drunk
too young, handed pornography around; worse still, they used their daggers
and burgled houses. Girls, especially maidservants, seemed to be as randy as
the boys, drank with them in alehouses that were little better than
brothels, and finished up well pregnant before marriage. Below the surface
of a God-fearing, deeply moralistic community, old Adam was up to his usual
games.
Sexuality, however, was not the only problem. Higher in the social scale
charitable money sometimes took years to reach the poor and deserving and,
on occasion, got lost. There were rumours that even John White was not
adverse to lining his own pocket in his promotion of a godly Dorchester in
New England. Piety and profit made restless bedfellows.
The roots of Dorchester's puritan reformation proved shallow. Its
inhabitants could live with it; they were not prepared to die for it and
they succumbed to the Royalist armies in 1643. The corporation behaved with
the utmost circumspection during the turbulent years that followed; with
relief they rang their bells vigorously on Charles II's return.
The great charitable enterprises of earlier decades, the Hospital, the Free
School and the Corporation Brewhouse whose profits paid their bills, slowly
fell into desuetude and Dorchester reverted to being unremarkable - just
another market town.
Professor Underwood's fascinating book is more than a mere contribution to
social and local history. It is also salutary. There is a group of radical
chic historians led by Lord Russell who regard the English Civil War and its
vicious aftermath as a mere squall about nothing that rapidly blew itself
out. We can, in this book, see how the growing elite of Dorchester had to
define, in the most serious and profound way, its attitudes to
constitutional conflicts at the deepest level, the nature of sovereignty and
the definition of the rights of the individual.
This is a very wise book, scholarly in its approach but immensely enjoyable
reading. It will help to bring the debate about the causes of the Civil War
back to reality.

JAMES JOYCE: THE YEARS OF GROWTH 1882-1915
by Peter Costello
Kyle Cathie Pounds 17.99, 374 pages
IF JOYCE never let go of Dublin, Dublin has never let go of Joyce. An
International James Joyce Symposium was held there earlier this month and
this new biography by a Dubliner has been published to coincide with it.
True, to Dublin's humiliation, it was an American academic, the late Richard
Ellmann, who in 1959 'the precious diadem stole and put it in his pocket',
in the form of a biography of the Irish writer that seems unlikely ever
wholly to be surpassed. That book, re-published by Oxford in 1982 in a
revised form, remains the standard life, and is still indispensable reading
for anyone interested in Joyce.
Meanwhile a completely new edition of Ulysses is awaited, prepared by John
Kidd, another American academic, who works at the James Joyce Research
Center at Boston University. It was Kidd who pointed out the 'errors of
execution' in the previous (1984) edition and set going a furore. His
edition is scheduled to appear in September from Norton and will be the
first volume in the new 'Dublin Edition' of Joyce's works. Each will be
based on a freshly edited text with an introduction by Denis Donoghue.
At the same time Dublin-based scholars of the Joyce industry have not by any
means been idle, as is proved by this informative work from Peter Costello.
The hidden agenda underlying the imaginative work of Joyce came from the
lives of people who lived in Dublin at the turn of the century. Their loves
and hates, their efforts to make a living in a harsh economic climate,
culminating frequently in debt or bankruptcy, their love of music and song,
their complex web of involvement with each other, is continually being
refracted through the fiction. First lucidly, in Dubliners, Stephen Hero and
A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man; later increasingly opaquely, in
Exiles, Ulysses and Finnegans Wake.
Ellmann named many originals but was in some of his identifications
confused; perhaps in one or two instances he was deliberately put off the
scent by the people he interviewed. His main research was done in the 1950s,
since which time more hard facts have emerged about Joyce's prototypes in
real life. Peter Costello possesses an encyclopedic knowledge of the public
history and private feuds of Dublin and its citizens over the past century.
He has previous books to his credit on the Irish revolution in modern
literature and on Clongowes Wood College, Joyce's first school.
Costello stops at 1915, merely summarising the later years. By then Joyce,
aged 33, had left Dublin for good and had, thanks to the efforts of Pound
and his colleagues on The Egoist, gained a measure of recognition as a
novelist. It is the preceding years covering Joyce's childhood and early
manhood that concern Costello. He fills in the tense political atmosphere of
that era in Irish history, interweaving the fortunes of the Joyce family
with those of Parnell and other figures on the larger stage.
John Stanislaus Joyce, Joyce's father, appears here more fully than ever
before. He begins as a man of force and substance with a well-paid job in
local government, a collector of rates; then, sadly, he goes into moral and
financial decline. There is a parallel with what we know of Shakespeare's
father in whose life a similar pattern may be discerned. Unfortunately in
'Jack' Joyce's case his famous son did not redeem the family fortune in his
lifetime.
Many of the more fugitive figures in the Joyce story also come out of this
book more clearly than hitherto. Costello has discovered the original of EC
or Emma Clery - Stephen's beloved in Hero and A Portrait. She was Mary
Cleary, a university contemporary of Joyce's, one of the first women to
graduate in Dublin, and later, as Mrs James Nahor Meenan, wife of a
well-known Dublin physician, a pioneer of women's education in Ireland.
Costello has some new light to shed on Leopold Bloom. His earliest
originator was Alfred H. Hunter, a dark-complexioned man in this thirties
whom Joyce met at the funeral in Dublin of a friend of his father's. Ellmann
describes him as 'putatively Jewish'. But, as we now learn, Hunter was a
Belfast Presbyterian married to a Catholic wife who was unfaithful to him.
His wanderings around Dublin suggested a story to Joyce to be called
'Ulysses' or 'Oolissays' as he pronounced it - a story Joyce never wrote as
such.
Again, Costello offers a fascinating fresh glimpse into the world of the
elderly Flynn sisters, Joyce's aunts, whose annual parties with musical
interludes, dancing and feasting furnished her nephew with the material for
his greatest short story, 'The Dead', where they appear as maiden ladies -
the Misses Morkan. Many of the characters in that crowded tale have
counterparts, as Ellmann indicated, in the Joyce family circle. Costello
brings them back to life and for the first time the heroine's former lover
is identified as deriving from one Michael Feeney. This unfortunate young
man - Michael Furey in the story - was in love with Nora Barnacle when she
was working in a convent before she met Joyce. Feeney died of typhoid and
pneumonia in a workhouse infirmary. He became, in Joyce's imagination, the
young man whom Gretta Conroy, his heroine, remembers so poignantly at the
end of his story.
Such research means there will have to be new footnotes appended to the
lives of a host of fictional characters who, since Joyce died, have belonged
to the world as much as to Dublin. I, for instance, tend to think of Gretta
nowadays as taking on her most recent incarnation, that of Anjelica Huston,
in John Huston's fine film of 'The Dead', much more than I think of her as
Nora Barnacle. But it is salutary to be reminded of her original, along with
those of many other characters in the Joyce canon.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Travel: Thailand: how to survive those long, hot nights - In
Bangkok Justin Wintle confronts the deadly and squalid side of the country's
much-publicised sex industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUSTIN WINTLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WAS entirely my fault. One night in Bangkok I took my companion to
Patpong to bargain-hunt among the stalls. Patpong is famous for its
well-made imitation Rolex watches, Dunhill wallets, Cartier handbags and
Chanel or Hermes silk scarves.
So good have some of these products become that connoisseurs no longer call
them fake Rolexes but Thai Rolexes. There are other things as well,
including indigenous Thai goods: scarves, T-shirts, wood-carvings, silk
skirts. Indeed, since Thais have as much flair for design as they do for
copying, it always beats me why they do not concentrate more on making
originals.
But Patpong, three narrow lanes between the Suriwongse and Silom Roads, has
been famous for things other than its busy night-mart. The central lane is
lined with girly bars. There are also boy bars and massage parlours and
places that put on 'special shows.' Whatever your fancy seeks, Patpong can
supply it, for Patpong is the heart of Bangkok's well-canvassed sex
industry.
The bars you can just walk into, although most potential clients will find
themselves pulled in by young women usually clad in not much more than a
bikini. Inside there are many more scantily-dressed females, some of whom
dance on raised catwalks around which clients sip or gulp beer. Although the
girls are paid to dance, they are also for sale. To overcome any language
barriers they wear numbers, so all you have to do is give a waiter or
waitress the number of your choice and you are away.
The special shows are marginally harder to get into. Mostly they are found
up seedy and uninviting staircases. Pimps hang around and invite customers
inside. To overcome any difficulties of communication, they carry cards that
have a bill of attractions printed in English. Not a lot is left to the
imagination.
As it happened, we were more interested in the cards than in their contents.
If one is going to buy a souvenir in Bangkok then one should at least come
away with something representative. So, having had three or four cards
flashed under my nose, I started bargaining.
The pimp in question was taken aback. This was a perversion he had not
previously encountered. 'You want card, mister? What can mister do with
card?' That I did not tell him, but I did offer 50 baht, about Pounds 1.20.
At once he demanded 100 baht. The cards were hard to come by, he said; in
any case, they were not for sale.
At this point the Scottish in me started to surface. I was damned if I was
going to pay Pounds 2.40 for a piece of paper. After a lot more haggling,
therefore, we struck a different sort of deal. We would go with him to the
den he worked for, sit inside for five minutes and buy one beer at a cost of
55 baht. In return, we would be presented with a card free of charge.
Unfortunately, having taken us around a corner and up some back-stairs, he
neglected to inform the management of our arrangement. Instead he scarpered.
'Superstars,' as it was called, struggled to live up to its advertising. I
could see no ping-pong balls, although through a smoke-filled haze I did
discern a female, naked and recumbent, playing with a Marlboro.
Otherwise, the place was similar to the bars at street level. Very loud
music accompanied the various gyrations of underclad lovelies caressing the
chrome uprights that connected the raised catwalk to the ceiling. Fearful of
what might have been slipped into it, I drank one-third of my beer.
Then we made our way to the cash desk. Instead of being asked to pay 55
baht, however, we were asked to pay 1,200. A previously concealed notice was
now revealed to us. We had both sat down, so that alone cost us 400 baht
each. We were also expected to cough up for non-existent face-towels and
'ladies drinks.'
The Scottish in me combined forces with an English upper lip. I refused to
pay, and demanded to see the manager. The man I was talking to replied that
he was the manager, and in no time at all became extremely abusive,
physically as well as verbally. Simultaneously, four or five other louts
materialised around us.
This upset me. Nor was the magic phrase 'tourist police' to much avail. The
man simply got more excited. It was this, however, that eventually reduced
the bill by 1,000 baht. To lose your cool is very un-Thai, and the more cool
he lost the weaker his position became. In the end we settled for 200 baht,
or something under Pounds 5.
Bearing in mind the availability of cheap and lethal flick-knives on the
street outside, we were probably lucky to get away for under Pounds 5. My
instinct was to head for the first policeman I saw. But the problem here was
that there were an awful lot of policemen about, and most appeared to be
holding hands with pimps.
I thought about contacting the tourist police from my hotel, but quickly saw
that it would lead to more trouble than it was worth. If I had brought a
charge I would probably have had to stay longer in the country. In addition,
it might have given the opposition a hook on my identity, and that I did not
want either.
In the end we chose to forget about it. But the real moral of the tale is
that we were lucky. Contact with Thailand's sex industry can be deadly, and
not just because of flick-knives. In the old days it was the 'gift that goes
on giving,' gonorrhea or syphilis. Today it is the 'gift that one day
kills,' Aids.
The statistics are terrifying. Four years ago the Thai government would only
admit to six cases, all of them 'imported.' Since then officials have been
obliged to open their eyes. By 1995 it is expected that there will be about
1.5m HIV carriers in Thailand.
Matters are exacerbated by the widespread use of needle-injected drugs,
particularly among women prostitutes, or men whose habits they are
supporting, and by a reputedly high incidence of bisexuality. The underlying
epidemological explanation must reside in the scale of Thai prostitution
itself.
A shock-horror headline story in the Thai press last year concerned a
suburban 'tea-house.' A distressed husband found that his wife had been
abducted by the owner and put to gainful employment. A police raid liberated
the wife and 17 other such women. Tests showed that all 18 were HIV
positive.
Tea-houses represent the bottom of the market. They are knocking shops whose
'employees' are expected to 'entertain' 15 or more clients a day, at perhaps
100 or 150 baht a head. Above and beyond the tea-houses, however, is a
devastating array of facilities: massage parlours, cocktail lounges, go-go
bars, nightclubs and hostess clubs.
In all, it is estimated that there are upwards of 800,000 women involved.
The pricier the establishment, the more say they will have in the choice of
customer. But in the long run that offers little or no protection.
A common misconception is that Thailand's sex industry has grown up as a
tourist attraction. In fact, most transactions are with Thai men. I have met
very few Thai males whose idea of a night out is not a few bottles of beer
either preceded or followed by a woman, or both. The evidence is that
foreign visitors are gradually turning away from the bar-girls, except at
the spectator level, but that the domestic scene is as lively as ever.
Condoms are widely available, but how widely they are used is a different
matter. Medics fear that mechai, as they are called, after Mechai
Viravaidya, the first and seemingly only government minister to concern
himself with what in Thailand must become a devastating plague, induce a
sense of false security. As one doctor said to me: 'Anything can happen to a
mechai. It can slip off, it can puncture, it can burst, it can run out, or
it can just sit quietly by the mattress.'
In Thailand, there are only two sure-fire prophylactics. One is to keep
saying 'No,' the other is to stock up with sleeping pills. That way you will
survive those long hot oriental nights.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Travel: Schumann in the mansions - The Newport music
festival and the ugly houses where its staged
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICKY SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THIS year's music festival in Newport, Rhode Island, promises even more
'programmes so extraordinary, so rich and rare that they draw music lovers
from thousands of miles away.'
The 24th festival (July 5-19) takes as its main theme a special series of 14
afternoon Schumanniads offering a retrospective of Schumann's chamber works.
Other performances take place morning, afternoon and evening, and there will
be more than a sprinkling of receptions and gala dinners.
The music festival is a highlight of Newport's packed summer calendar. In a
city that boasts sailing, polo, tennis and jazz among its annual activities,
the music festival has a devoted following.
The festival takes place in and around some of Newport's famous summer
mansions. Several of these remarkable monuments have been grouped under the
protection of the Preservation Society of Newport since 1945. They are
shrines to the aspirations and beliefs of families like the Vanderbilts and
Astors, flamboyantly interpreted by architects Richard Morris Hunt and
Stanford White.
Marble House and The Breakers, both designed by Hunt, are opulent beyond
belief. They are also remarkably ugly, having solidly pompous exteriors and
an air of greedy imitation.
Marble House, commissioned in 1888, was the answer to William Kissem
Vanderbilt's request for 'the very best living accommodation that money
could buy.' The Dollars 11m 'cottage' was modelled on the Petit Trianon at
Versailles and completed in 1892.
Five of the festival's concerts will be held at Marble House, while others
will be performed in its Vanderbilt twin, The Breakers. Here, with the ocean
as backdrop, it would be hard to resist an evening performance offering
Porter and Gershwin on the terrace near the recently restored lower loggia.
The ticket price of Dollars 40 (Pounds 22) includes a champagne reception
afterwards.
Belcourt Castle, built for Oliver Belmont and his wife, the former Mrs
William Vanderbilt, is probably the grandest of the mansions which are not
under the care of the preservation society.
Belcourt hosts a particularly interesting programme on July 18 - works by
Schumann, including nine early songs, five pieces in folk style and six
intermezzi. For music lovers who like alfresco dining, there will be a box
lunch concert with the Leontovych String Quartet at Hammersmith Farm. The
28-room cottage was built by John W Auchincloss in 1887 and was the
childhood home of Jacqueline Bouvier, who married John F Kennedy in Newport.
Tickets for the music festival can be ordered by telephoning 401-849-0700.
Food, especially sea-food, is a feature of any visit to Newport. Between
concerts you could visit Christie's, on the waterfront, at 351 Thames
Street, tel: 401-847-5400, for baked scrod (cod), giant clams and cream puff
sundae. Or try Pronto's, a new Italian restaurant also on Thames Street.
(Avoid Saturdays unless prepared for a long wait).
Accommodation in Newport is best found at inns. Whether small, like Clovell
House, originally built in 1805, or large, like the Castle Inn, a Victorian
summer mansion on a hill overlooking Narragansett Bay, they all have
atmosphere. The Newport County Chamber of Commerce at 10 America's Cup
Avenue Newport RI 02840 (PO Box 237, tel: 401-847-1600) will provide a list
of guest houses and small inns, as will Newport Historic Inns, PO Box 981,
tel: 401-846-7666.
Travel to and from Newport is convenient from Boston or New York. British
Airway's new daily flight, at present the only one from Gatwick to New York,
flies DC-10s and departs at 10am. You arrive at JFK at 12.40pm, leaving
plenty of time to catch one of many connecting flights to Providence from
where the Cosy Cab shuttle serves Newport. BA also has daily flights from
Boston to Heathrow. Bonanza Bus Lines commutes between Boston and Newport
(single ticket: Dollars 12).

FT  27 JUN 92 / Travel: Old England behind the Celtic burglar bars -
Nicholas Woodsworth was charmed by West Dorset in the rain
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NICHOLAS WOODSWORTH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE than 2,000 years ago, a Celtic tribe called the Durotriges moved into a
hill-top home not far from the coast of southern England. Invasion and
pillage of country homes was even more a threat then than today, but
although the Durotriges were an Iron Age people, basic burglar bars, let
alone electronic alarms and home insurance policies, were somewhat beyond
them.
Feeling exposed, they set about building the finest complex of defensive
earthworks in Britain - a flattened hill-top surrounded by concentric rings
of 60-ft ditches and 90-ft earthen breastworks two miles in circumference.
Strongly defended, Maiden Castle, as the hill is called, was at one time
home to 5,000 tribespeople; it withstood attack for centuries, and even held
out a good while against more advanced invaders from the east, the armies of
imperial Rome.
After centuries of battering by wind, storms and rain, the warrior-haunted
defences of Maiden Castle still look daunting enough to keep eastern
invaders away from its rural hinterland. And perhaps, in some mystical
Celtic way, they continue to do just that.
The land to the east of Dorchester, the county town just two miles from the
hill, is increasingly the domain of long-distance London commuters. The land
to the west, Devon and Cornwall, has long suffered annual invasion by
frantic hordes of holiday-makers from all over Britain.
But, in a small triangle of west Dorset, in countryside bounded by the
peculiarly-formed Chesil Beach, the old abbey town of Sherborne and the
seaside resort of Lyme Regis, strange forces seem to operate. Against all
the odds, this is an old-fashioned, scenic and peacefully rural place that
the developers have left largely to itself.
Although it is less than five miles away, I could not see the sea on the
spring day I bent into the wind and trudged to the summit of Maiden Castle.
Blustery and cold, it brought with it low, obscuring cloud and showers that
spat down on anyone foolish enough to be outside looking for signs of a new
and gentler season.
Perhaps, though, the sea is not visible from here even in the most clement
weather. West Dorset is a country of hills, smooth, green and sheep-dotted,
that rise bank upon bank to the horizon. In good weather they are like an
exercise in the art of Italian renaissance perspective. In bad weather they
are an exercise in exposure. I felt sorry for the Iron Age tribes who
throughout west Dorset spent their time shivering in hill-top ring forts,
and decided to see if things were any more sheltered and spring-like down at
the seaside.
They were. Not far from Abbotsbury, an old village overlooking one of the
strangest geographical features in Britain, I met a flock of some of the
most fortunate swans around. The inhabitants of the Swannery, more than 500
of them, live in a bird's paradise, a brackish, eight-mile-long lagoon known
as the Fleet where they are protected from the winds and storms of the open
sea by Chesil Beach, a bank of pebbles 50 ft high and 200 yards wide lying,
as if sulking after some terrific spat with the mainland, some distance
off-shore.
Not only are they happily sheltered from the elements, but the birds are
also the only colony of swans in the world to be managed by humans.
Originally raised by medieval Benedictine monks for their meat, the swans
here remain wild but are provided with an environment in which nesting and
hatching can be overseen. Between the sea and the hills, in a setting of
lush reeds and feathery pampas grasses, I strolled among hundreds of the
birds as they brooded over eggs in their nests, bickered over territorial
rights, and splashed down by the shores of the Fleet like parachute-born
water-skiers.
But the swans had an advantage over me; when a late afternoon shower
arrived, their down kept them warm and dry. I made a dash for it, and drove
not far up the coast to west Bay, a little port of tackle shops and fishing
boats. There in the snug Riverside Restaurant, advised by amiable owner
Arthur Watson and his wife Jan, I consoled myself with a magnificent fish
dinner of home-made seafood soup and fillets of John Dory.
One of the great pleasures of west Dorset is being able to get away from it
all - city life, crowds and commercialism - and escape to the heart of the
country. So, instead of booking myself into a hotel in a seaside town, I
drove up through hills and mist in the falling dusk to the tiny village of
Netherbury. Here I found Heritage, a bed-and-breakfast establishment run by
a Frenchwoman named Michelle Seymour.
Michelle knows what escape from the fast track is all about. A former
airline hostess, she has chosen one of the loveliest villages in Dorset to
settle in. Sitting on the banks of the little River Brit not far from the
market town of Beaminster, it is a vision of English rural peace, a place
whose most ambitious activity is cider-making. The rain had stopped and
lights were burning in cottage windows by the time I went out to stretch my
legs.
In neatly-kept gardens water dripped from every tree, bush and newly-bloomed
spring flower. In twilight and the distant hill-side baa-ing of new-born
lambs, I walked through the mossy, tilted gravestones of Netherbury's
church-yard. An owl hooted in a copse nearby and the hour rang from the
tower of the old grey stone church. Scented odours wafted from damp lilacs.
I had forgotten what tranquility was.
Villages like Netherbury, and there are lots within a 10-mile radius of
Beaminster, are wonderful places from which to explore some of the most
unspoilt country in southern England. Much of the charm here is man-made and
has to do with a long and rich rural past that has not yet been obliterated;
it takes the form of thatched cottages, stone-built houses, or the abbeys,
manors, priories and churches lying around the corner of hedgerow-lined
country roads.
The other part of the charm comes from the land itself. Steep and rolling,
the hills of west Dorset do not lend themselves to modern agriculture. In
parts they are wild and forested; in others, where sheep have grazed vast
hillside pastures to a uniform smoothness, they take on a park-like quality.
The whole - village and countryside - leaves one with the feeling that Old
England is not yet wholly out of reach.
Even in Old England the merry month of May - to say nothing of entire
summers - must have often been wet. But there can be few places left in the
country pretty enough that rain does not dampen the weekend explorer's
enthusiasm: after three soggy days of roaming around west Dorset I was still
enjoying it.
Under a torrential downpour I strolled past the mermaid pond, the ha ha and
the bog garden of Forde Abbey, a glorious 12th century Cistercian monastery
now turned stately home. Through drizzle and drifting fog I gazed at the
Naked Giant, priapic magnificence from Roman times etched with chalk into a
hillside at Cerne Abbas. In Sherborne I ducked into another even greater
abbey to avoid a heavy shower; there I met an elderly lady who wheeled over
to me a strange, mirrored trolley so I might look at the fan-vaulted ceiling
without getting a crick in my neck. I am afraid I dripped water all over it.
But on the third day, when I least expected it, the weather turned. As I was
hunting around under the sea cliffs of the Black Ven at Charmouth, the sun
came out and glinted on burnished ammonites hiding in the sand, one of the
treasures that makes the coast around Lyme Regis so popular with fossil
hunters. And, in the town of Lyme itself, I saw a new season come suddenly
into bloom.
Along the now sunny water-front promenade the deck-chairs were out. The
first ice-creams of the year appeared. Their romantic fancy stirred by the
warm spring air, retired accountants from Birmingham gazed out to sea
through 20p-in-the-slot telescopes. Down on the Cobbe, their wives were
imitating Meryl Streep with long sighs and waiting for their own French
Lieutenant to come sailing in.
Who would not be happy with a day like this? Moon-faced teenaged lovers
wandered the promenade, hand in hand. Children splashing in the water, in
spite of the evidence of blue legs, had persuaded themselves that summer was
not far away.
On the other side of west Dorset the sun shone even on Maiden Castle. It was
a day that would have convinced the shivering Durotriges themselves that a
new age had at last arrived.

FT  27 JUN 92 / How to Spend It: A snappy Dresser - A look at the work of an
influential designer who has returned to cult status
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALICE RAWSTHORN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IF YOU glance at Oggetti in Fulham Road, south London, you will see a couple
of teapots in the window display. Most things in Oggetti are expensive, but
these teapots are really expensive - Pounds 5,800 each.
They are part of a limited edition of products designed by Christopher
Dresser - and reproduced in sterling silver by Alessi, the Italian company
best known for its work with contemporary designers such as Philippe Starck
and Frank Gehry - which will be on sale at Oggetti until September.
One teapot is in the shape of a triangle, another is hemispherical, the
third is a square squatting on four spindly 'crow's feet' legs that are a
hallmark of Dresser's style. They look, as Oggetti's Paul Marquess says, as
if they were designed yesterday but they date back to the 1880s.
Christopher Dresser was a 19th century British botanist who abandoned his
studies of plants for product design. He was a socialist idealist who, fired
by the belief that industrialisation was changing the world for the better,
became the first designer to embrace the machine age.
Dresser lived at a time when mainstream taste was dominated by the grandeur
of Victorian baroque and when the avant garde were wedded to William Morris
and the Arts and Craft Movement. Dresser's designs were completely
different. His style was functional, simple and his aim was to ensure that
all his designs could be made by machine.
During his career Dresser enjoyed a cult following, not only in Britain but
as far away as Japan. He worked with more than 60 manufacturers on
wallpapers, fabrics, furniture, glassware and ceramics.
But he was always seen as an oddball. His modernist theories, now standard
stuff, were regarded as eccentric and his designs dismissed as novelties. By
the end of his life he had slipped into obscurity.
Dresser has now returned to cult status in design circles where he is hailed
as the forerunner of the modern industrial designer. Dresser originals are
much sought after by collectors.
This revival of interest persuaded Alessi to consider reproducing some of
Dresser's designs. Alessi tends to be associated with the post-modernist
styling of the 1980s when its products, such as Starck's lobster-like lemon
squeezer and the bird-spouted kettle designed by Michael Graves, the
American architect, became the archetypal designer objects of the decade.
But the core of its collection has always been meticulously-made,
contemporary classic designs, many dating back to the 1940s and 1950s.
In the mid-1980s it introduced a small range of archive designs, by Marianne
Brandt, a German artist who studied at the Bauhaus in the 1920s, and Josef
Hoffmann, the fin de siecle Viennese designer who was a leading exponent of
Art Nouveau.
Alberto Alessi, who now runs the company his grandfather founded in the
1920s, is keen to expand the archive range. The days when a Starck lemon
squeezer was the essential accessory are over.
If Alessi is to avoid being relegated to the ranks of the relics of the
1980s, it has to address the new sensibility of the 1990s.
Christopher Dresser, with his restrained designs and whiff of 19th century
authenticity, is a perfect addition to its range. The only problem for
Alessi was that it was very difficult to track down his original designs.
Most of Dresser's original products have disappeared, as have many of his
notebooks. Alessi had to reconstruct his blueprints from the few records it
could find using computer-aided design techniques, and then check the
results against original objects borrowed from collectors.
Although Dresser was obsessed by the machine age, most of his products were
made by hand as the silversmiths and metal workers of his era had very
little machinery. Alessi has been able to adapt two of his products - a tray
and a toast rack - to be mass-produced in stainless steel at its modern
factories.
These are now on sale at its usual London outlets, the Conran Shop and
Authentics as well as Oggetti, for around Pounds 70 and Pounds 60
respectively. The other Dresser designs, the sterling silver limited edition
now on show at Oggetti, have been made by hand.
Paul Marquess is still convinced that, recession or not, at least some of
Oggetti's customers will be willing to spend a few thousand pounds for a
Christopher Dresser sugar bowl. Perhaps he hopes they will be thinking of
the original 1880s Dresser teapot that sold for Pounds 60,000 at a London
auction last year, which makes Pounds 5,800 for a 1990s reproduction seem
(almost) cheap.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Summer Food: Fire, without smoke - Barbecues really do go
better with gas
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER KNIGHT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A GAS barbecue might sound like heresy, but it works. It is ready in 10
minutes (as opposed to at least 30 with charcoal), the fuel is clean (no
dirty hands and no woodsmoke) and it does not need to be lit with smelly and
environmentally damaging petrochemicals.
More important, the food tastes just as good cooked with gas as it does with
the more traditional fuels.
But there is a problem. All gas barbecues look hideous, much like an old
radiogramme stuck to the top of a wheeled Zimmer frame. These contraptions -
known as 'wagons' - are certainly not suitable for Design Museum groupies,
who much prefer the beautifully bulbous Weber kettles. Weber does offer a
gas model but it is also in the 'wagon-style'. As one of my snootier
metropolitan friends put it when he first saw my latest toy: 'Very
Weybridge, don't you think?'
Grilled meat, goes the theory, gets its unique taste from the fat that drips
from the meat, vaporises on the hot coals and returns to flavour its source.
Most gas barbecues provide a layer of larva rock between the flame and the
food. Some use metal or a ceramic surface instead, but the idea is to
provide radiant heat underneath the food - exactly the same principle as
glowing charcoal.
Barbecueing is mainly a male hobbyist activity and is consequently riddled
with mystique and claptrap. Every daddy with his Texas Homecare tongs and
plasticised apron has a theory on how to get the best flavour from the
coals. Some use wood chips, some marinade, some blow the dust from the coals
with a hairdryer and many manage to undercook the chicken while smoking out
the neighbours.
All you really need for a barbecue - if you have the space and no neighbours
 -is a bit of chicken wire, a few bricks and some logs to burn into coals.
But few of us, especially those in the city, have this opportunity. That is
why I spent about Pounds 120 on a Thermos WG22 - which so grievously fails
the domestic aesthetics test that my wife forces me to hide in the hedge.
You do not have to spend as much, but most people spend much more. There are
portable versions for under Pounds 50. These are simple trays with a burner
and some larva rock. The carrying handles become feet and they work off
disposable Gaz cylinders found in camping shops. For double the price you
get a much sturdier device that has automatic ignition (as in a cooker),
uses a refillable Calor gas cylinder and has two adjustable burners, which
give gradations of heat on the same cooking surface.
The barbecues become more sophisticated as the price rises, with the most
expensive models costing about Pounds 500. However, no matter what the
price, the principle remains roughly the same, although some manufacturers
replace the larva rock with metal or porcelain devices that are designed to
do the same job.
Most gas barbecues have a lid that turns the device into an oven. Large
pieces of meat or whole chickens can be roasted with the lid down, either on
a spit or on a dish. The lid can also be used to smoke the meat, by throwing
aromatic wood chips on the larva rock a few minutes before serving.
British Gas sells a range of bottled gas barbecues from Pounds 45 to Pounds
400. It also offers a small range of fixed versions that are built in and
connected to the gas mains. Garden centres, department stores, DIY stores
and Argos also sell gas models.
A big drawback is that these barbecues are reasonably complicated bits of
machinery and they have to be assembled at home like some giant Meccano set.
Unless you particularly like spending time screwing bits of metal together,
this can be tedious.
You will need to allow at least two to three hours to put them together. Be
prepared to get very frustrated along the way and, above all, make sure you
read the erratum note in the instructions. I spent ages wondering how I was
going to get a WG screw into a hole that was obviously designed to take a
different diameter.
If you can persuade the shop to sell it assembled, do. It really is worth
it. Do not even try to put it together unless you are reasonably calm about
screwing, bolting and following written instructions. Gas can be dangerous
and while home assembly is not difficult, it must be done correctly.
Choosing between the different models is difficult. Price usually reflects
the ruggedness of construction and the number of extra facilities, such as
shelves and racks. The more expensive versions also have glass windows on
the lid so that you can peek in to see how the roast is doing.
The main difference is in the size of the grilling area (important if you
want to cater for crowds) and extras such as warming racks and shelves.
Remember to ask if the price includes a regulator - the switch that goes on
the gas cylinder.
I was in a hurry and bought my Thermos from Sainsbury's Homebase. It does
not sell regulators and did not know where I could get one. I would have got
a marginally better deal at British Gas which included a regulator and (at
the moment) a Pounds 5 voucher for the gas cylinder, which has to be bought
elsewhere. British Gas includes delivery in its price. Argos sells the same
model at Pounds 99, but without a regulator (about Pounds 10).
Barbecueing on gas is a little different from charcoal. Heat is controlled
by regulating the flame rather than moving the grill. At my first attempt I
had the heat too high and the chicken fat caused rather alarming flaring.
Once the flame was reduced and the larva rock had cooled sufficiently the
chicken cooked well.
You can give vegetables, such as sliced aubergines and zucchini, that
authentic criss-cross grill pattern and they taste as good as in any
fashionable Italian restaurant, especially when piled high and dressed with
parmesan, basil and olive oil.
One of the biggest benefits of gas is that you can have char-grilled food
throughout the year without going to a restaurant. I am not sure if I will
be out in the garden grilling in my overcoat in December, but I like to
think I will.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Summer Drink: Drinking in the sunshine - Giles MacDonogh
pours himself a Pimms and plans a summer party
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GILES MACDONOGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
I SPENT a terrible two days last weekend, tying myself in knots costing a
summer drinks party. With a pocket-calculator in one hand and a bottle of
Pimms in the other, I endeavoured to come up with the precise figure I
needed to spend in order to entertain:
1 50 sober, responsible people;
2 50 not so sober, responsible people;
3 50 drunken, irresponsible people.
I was working on the basis of a double measure of Pimms (16 to the bottle)
to about a quarter litre of lemonade plus the usual fruit and ice; enough to
fill a half pint pot. In my mind's eye the first group would drink about a
litre and that (with a few edibles thrown in) would set me back roughly
Pounds 200. Having arrived at this figure I decided that the next two could
be arrived at arithmetically: Pounds 250 and Pounds 300 respectively. In the
last instance the guests would receive two litres each. Given the presence
of a few sober people and drivers this would mean that some people would get
royally drunk.
Then I spoke to Valli Watson at Party Professionals, and she told me I was
mad. The party, she said, would cost about Pounds 130: 'Nobody could drink
more than three-quarters of a litre of Pimms.' I put down my pocket
calculator in despair.
That left me with a glass of Pimms and some reflections on the Englishman's
summer drink. Pimms has changed rather a lot recently. For a start it has
moved to Scotland, and the gin base for the more popular No 1 Cup is also
Scottish distilled.
The alcohol content appears to have been lowered from 30 per cent to 25 per
cent, meaning that the old trick of adding a slug has become a practical
necessity (Valli tells me to add spirit to the first round and produce
weaker drinks as the party goes on).
There used to be six cups; latterly there were three; now there are two, and
the vodka-based No 6 is increasingly difficult to find. I only tracked it
down to Gerry's at 74 Old Compton Street, London W1 (071-734-2053).
I marginally prefer the Vodka Cup (as it is now called) to the gin-based No
1. The No 1 is darker, and tastes of oranges and caramel. The No 6 is
lighter and more lemony. It does not taste quite so sweet.
As students we used to drink a lot of Pimms and were always on the look-out
for ways of gingering it up. One method was to add more gin and cider. I
have seen people put champagne into Pimms but I think this is rather a waste
of champagne; especially now that prices have gone through the roof.
One alternative which appeals to me is a Maibowle: a traditional German
summer punch. In Theodor Fontane's Schach von Wuthenow of 1882 the publisher
Sandars gives the recipe specifying the use of May herbs woodruff and
celandine: 'Don't let them infuse for too long. Woodruff is not camomile
tea. Mosel wine, let's say a Zeltinger or a Brauneberger, pour that slowly
over the herbs; that is enough. Oranges are there simply for ornament's sake
. . . and don't make it too sweet . . '
Some readers might object that woodruff is hard to come by but it cannot be
any more difficult than the obligatory sprig of borage which floats in the
Pimms.
A suggestion from Austria is a mixture of vodka, elderberry cordial and
mint. A little elderflower cordial goes a long way, diluted to one 16th
strength. In Oporto the standard summer drink is slightly chilled tawny
port; although this might seem a rather serious (and expensive) solution to
the summer drinks party.
White port, however, can be turned into a long drink by using tonic water
with a sprig of mint. A more English solution is a cider cup. Andre Simon's
Dictionary of Wines and Spirits of 1958 suggests a litre of sweet cider to
75 cls of soda water, a glass of sherry, half a glass of brandy, lemon juice
and peel, nutmeg, pineapple and borage. A bone dry cider such as Merrydown
vintage might be more suitable for modern tastes. Cider cup has the virtue
of being cheap.
Now comes the problem of what, if anything, to give your guests to eat.
Valli Watson was all for Kettle crisps from America; pouring scorn on my
suggestion of black olives and salted nuts, which I imagined would provoke
the necessary thirst required for people to want to consume large quantities
of Pimms.
Another of her suggestions was ciabata bread with aubergine dip; or rubbed
with garlic and tomato and moistened with olive oil. Then she began giving
me recipes for dips and my head started to swim. I think I shall simply drop
in on Marks &amp; Spencer, which does a very decent range of ready mades for
parties: good taramasalata, houmus, aubergine dip and a Greek dip selection.
The American-style dip tray is also good. Of course at either side of Pounds
1 apiece, these things will work out dear for 50 people. It might be better
to stick to crisps.
Information: Party Professionals, 33 Kensington Park Road, London W11. (071-
221-3438).
Elderberry cordial is available from Thorncroft Vineyard, Highland Farm,
Leatherhead, Surrey. (0372-372558).
Top quality white ports such as Fonseca's Siroco or Taylor's Chip Dry sell
for around Pounds 9.50. The recommended retail price for Pimms No 1 or Vodka
Cup is Pounds 10.19.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Motoring: The perfectly formed joys of a microcar - Stuart
Marshall tests the latest fashion from Japan
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STUART MARSHALL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY CALL them microcars. There are dozens of different models, all small
and beautifully formed, made by companies which produce cars that are
household names. For driving where road and parking space are at a premium,
the cars cannot be bettered.
Sadly, there are only two ways of getting one. Go and live in Japan or
arrange to bring one into Britain as a personal import, of which more in a
moment.
In Japan, these under-660cc-engined microcars form a sub-class - 'sub' only
in size, certainly not in sophistication. Just consider the diminutive
Daihatsus that the UK importer, Daihatsu UK, invited me to sample in Jersey
a few days ago.
The Mira Turbo TRXX Avanzato - a very big name for a very small car - the
Leeza Oxy-R and Spider have fuel-injected, turbocharged and intercooled
three-cylinder engines (naturally with catalytic converters) putting out 63
horsepower at 7,500 rpm.
Mira and Leeza were air-conditioned, which was bliss in temperatures more
like those of the Cote d'Azur than the Channel Islands in early summer. They
had central door locking, electric windows and power steering. Gadgetry on
the Mira included a CD player with remote control and screenwipers and
lights that switched themselves on automatically when it rained or got dark.
Jersey is a beautiful island. It has beaches the size of those in Brittany,
rocky summits and a rural interior laced with tiny, high-hedged lanes.
Nowhere can you drive legally at more than 40 mph (64 kph). There are plenty
of 30 mph (48 kph) and 20 mph (32 kph) limits, too.
They are strictly enforced - and why not? Who has any reason to go faster on
a patch of land measuring 10 miles (16 kms) by six miles (9.7 kms) on which
the only straight piece of road is barely two miles (3.2 kms) long?
So, all I can say about the performance of these muscular midgets is that,
given full use of the five-speed gearbox, they leapt up to 40 mph with an
Olympic sprinter's speed and cornered like go-karts. The open two-seat Leeza
Spider's 4-speed automatic transmission worked as well as they do in cars of
twice its size.
Without turbocharging and intercooling, the standard Opti was no
mini-fireball but was acceptably lively and just as squeezable into tiny
spaces. Nothing could be handier for nipping down to the shops or threading
through heavy traffic. One Opti even had part-time four wheel drive. Should
the front wheels lose traction - as they might on snowy hills or even in a
damp, grassy paddock - you thumb a button in the gear lever knob and some of
the power is put through to the rear wheels.
The tiny Daihatsus are not much longer than a Rover Mini but are tall for
their size, so headroom is generous. They ride well. Providing you overlook
some elbow touching with your front passenger, they do not feel ridiculously
small when you drive them.
Daihatsu UK has no plans to bring microcars into Britain, at least while the
number of units it can import is limited by quota. For the moment, it makes
more sense (and more profit) to sell Pounds 8,000 Charade family hatchbacks
and Pounds 10,000-plus Fourtrak and Sportrak recreational 4x4s than Optis
from around Pounds 5,000 upwards.
If the urge to own one is irresistible, call Clive de Carle of Rare Imports
on 0734-713244. He ships in all manner of officially unobtainable Japanese
cars, from the Honda Beat mid-engined microcar (this column, December 7
1991) to a super-luxury Lexus coupe with active suspension.
As a personal import, you would have to collect it from Jersey or pay for it
to be delivered to your home. It is a slightly grey area of the motor trade
but de Carle is reassuring on matters like routine maintenance and the
availability of spare parts.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Sport: Kite flies in the sea breeze - Golf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN HOPKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TO THOSE who care about such matters, Tom Kite's victory in US Open last
Sunday maintained the scheme of things. If the weather had remained as
overcast and windless as it had been for the first three days, then we might
now be saluting Gil Morgan or Jeff Sluman. Morgan and Sluman are fine but
not outstanding players and Pebble Beach, an outstanding course, has always
produced a champion worthy of its setting. Pebble Beach has staged three US
Opens, won by Jack Nicklaus, Tom Watson 10 years later, and now Kite.
Kite, 42, does not diminish this category, for he has been a very good
player for a very long time, long enough to have racked up nearly Dollars 7m
(Pounds 3.7m) in prize money from the US tour, more than any other golfer.
He is also the professional's professional, hard-working and popular,
respected by his peers and a man who has a true sense of what golf is all
about.
He has competed in the Open for years, for example, realising that an
ability to cope with the seaside courses in Britain is essential for someone
striving to become a world golfer. Kite was one of the few Americans who
came to Royal St George's in 1985, a year when many of his countrymen gave
the Open a miss because they did not like what they had heard about the
course.
In 1972 and 1982 Nicklaus and Watson were the world's dominant golfers. Kite
is not their equivalent in the 1990s, but at last he has rid himself of the
tag that was beginning to drive him nuts - that of the best player never to
have won a major championship.
'I really felt good about Tom Kite,' Kite said. 'I felt good about my
career, my family. I felt so fortunate. I guess what bugged me was the only
thing that people wanted to talk about was why I had never won a major. It
was as if all the other things I had done did not count for anything.'
When I thought of Kite and major championships I always remembered a putt I
had seen him attempt in the 1986 US Masters. It was the year that Jack
Nicklaus won for the sixth time. Kite was vying for the lead in the fourth
round when he left an 8 ft uphill putt short on the 14th green. To miss was
forgiveable but to leave such a putt short was not. He will never win a
major championship, I thought. He has not got the heart for it.
This view seemed to be confirmed by other events in Kite's career. In the
Open at Royal St George's in 1985 he led approaching the 10th green of the
fourth round - only to pull an approach shot, thin a bunker shot and
under-hit a chip. He finished joint eighth. At Oak Hill in 1989 he led the
US Open by three strokes after 58 holes, only to triple bogey the 5th and
end with a 78. So there was some justification for doubting Kite's nerve in
a crisis.
Kite's nerve held well enough last Sunday to suggest that now he has won one
major, he could well win a couple more. He went from the 7th hole where he
took a three-stroke lead to the 18th playing the sort of golf I, for one,
did not think him capable of under pressure. He dropped shots at the 16th
and 17th but when it looked as though he might be beginning to wobble, he
gathered himself with one memorable stroke.
Even with a two-shot lead, the 18th at Pebble Beach is a nerve-wracking
hole. Fred Couples once took a nine there. Kite had driven with a three-wood
all week for safety and accuracy, but now, on the lip of victory, he chose a
driver. It could have been disastrous. The slightest hook and his ball would
have ended in the Pacific, next stop Tokyo. He could hit a long safe shot to
the right of the trees in the fairway.
Instead, showing his courage, Kite hit his drive down the daring left side
of the fairway, starting it out over the sea so that it would land safely to
the left of the trees. We saw a new Tom Kite at Pebble Beach last Sunday. He
did not do what kites do on windless days and fall to earth. Instead, he
soared high; he deserved to win.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Sport: A working boat goes racing - Sailing
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KEITH WHEATLEY

<TEXT>
OCEAN LEOPARD has become the boat to beat in today's Round The Island Race.
Last year the 80 ft maxiyacht smashed the monohull record for the annual
53-mile gallop round the Isle of Wight, so every one of the 1,500
competitors on the start line will be watching her chances of a repeat
performance. But owner Mike Slade is cautious about her chances.
'Coming out of the dream on the Sunday morning after last year's race, we
realised that we'd been incredibly lucky,' says Slade, chief executive of
property company Helical Bar. 'If it's blowing a fresh northerly then maybe
we could do it again.
'Round the Island is a great race for Leopard. She's got long legs and needs
time and space to pick up her skirts and go.'
What gripped many sailors about her 1991 feat, taking 22 minutes off the old
time, was that the yacht was still equipped with 'fridges, washing machines
and sofas from her workaday role as a charter yacht. Slade packed her with
over 30 old chums, when a minimal racing crew would have been 18.
Ultra lightweight hi-tech racing machines make so much of the news in modern
sailing. Yet here was a yacht, albeit big and expensive, that any everyday
sailor could identify with enjoying the limelight. The Round the Island
jaunt was the perfect race for Leopard to win: an annual festival of sail -
now the biggest regular yacht race in the world - attracting every one from
one-race-a-year 'picnickers' to the professional hot-shots.
David Alan Williams is both the designer of Ocean Leopard and acts as her
racing manager. Slade's yacht was the eighth of his Ocean 80 hulls to be
constructed; most are now cruising yachts and he gains great joy from seeing
one raced hard.
'No two rigs or keels have been the same,' explained Williams, 'so you could
say I've had a decade of full-size testing.'
For all Slade's insouciance about the chances of another record, Ocean
Leopard has spent the past fortnight having a new keel fitted. She went into
Hamble Yacht Services almost as soon as she arrived back from her winter
charter season in the Caribbean. Re-launch was only two days ago.
'I started designing the new keel in January and I'm fairly sure it will
give us better performance in light air. It's a relatively conventional lead
bulb on a steel fin,' says Williams, one of the more successful, if less
fashionable, yacht designers of the past decade. 'The previous tandem keel
was 'sticky' if the breeze dropped.'
Several new sails, a heavy-air spinnaker and No 4 genoa, have been added to
the Leopard's inventory, although not just for the Round the Island. Later
in the summer she is entered for the Round Great Britain race, an event
where Slade reckons the record is also up for grabs. 'We want to do well but
these are all fun races, not the America's Cup, and everyone aboard
occasionally reminds themselves of that,' says Williams, who also sails as
race skipper during the Nioulargue festival in St Tropez and the hectic
Antigua Race Week each spring.
So far, so glamorous. Yet in 1991 Ocean Leopard was beaten around the Island
on handicap by a 25 ft Folkboat, a 50-year-old design. It is the event's
charm that such things happen and are enjoyed by all.
The magic even rubs off on those who wish to charter the yacht for a simple
holiday or day's corporate sailing, and wouldn't dream of racing in 100
years.
'Leopard has to earn her living, but it's incredible how the high-profile of
last year's record has given clients new interest in her,' said Slade, who
skippers the yacht from behind the wheel rather than the owner's cabin.
If she were a racehorse, this would be her Derby Day: a little bit of
fashion, a lot of fun, and a great deal of competition. 'If we can take line
honours we'll be happy,' says Williams. 'Records come under the heading of
luck.'

FT  27 JUN 92 / Gardening: The seeds of discontent - There is tension over
the sorbet in the Sloane-Wally household
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBIN LANE FOX
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IT IS an extraordinary season and its wonderful strangeness has not been
lost on the Sussex Old Rectory to which Julian and Veronica Sloane-Wally
emigrated from Onslow Gardens in 1986.
Since then the property-market has gone wildly up and now wildly down,
narrowing the former Sussex-to-London gap. None the less, there are no
thoughts of returning, because the garden is coming on stream. Five years is
the span which a newly-planted garden needs in order to begin to show its
mettle. This weekend, the Sloane-Wallys are entertaining friends in a big
way, but there is a slight unease between them as they look at the fruits of
their past years' experience. It goes beyond the usual ups and downs of
mistakes and difficult seasons.
It is not just that the entire garden, like yours or mine, may well be over
for the year by Sunday. All week, Veronica has been praying that the
old-fashioned rose borders will not have dropped their petals by 6pm on
Saturday: even Julian lost some of his optimism when he found himself
dead-heading the pink delphiniums on Wednesday after work. Magenta geraniums
are fading with the first flush of flower on the purple petunias, and the
tassles of Love-Lies-Bleeding are already tumbling from the terracotta pots
which Julian recently bought.
For Love-Lies-Bleeding is not quite the emblem of the enterprise, but, as
the five years have passed, a clear rift has developed between the two
partners' styles. Histories of gardening have much to say about the great
English gardens which have resulted from husband-and-wife partnerships, but
they have less to say about those which emerge when he and she disagree.
Julian has held firm to his taste for boldness, order and formality: this
weekend, he is particularly proud of the walk of upright Ballerina
apple-trees, which he bought for the lower lawn when they first appeared at
Chelsea.  Veronica, however, has waivered.
At first, she thought she wanted controlled planting in formal beds, packed
together tightly so that none of it flopped. In the last two years, she has
changed course and now has fastened on to the natural look. Wild flowers
keep company with purples and stale yellows as a breath of hedgerow in the
garden. There are no weed-killers in her ecological Eden, although the white
Ox-eye daisies have driven out everything else which she raised from the
famous Farmers Nightmare seed-mixture, pioneered by Miriam Rothschild.
On late summer evenings, Julian longs to root out the jungle of
white-flowered Feverfew which has been allowed to seed into Little
Sissinghurst, the all-white garden which they started together, adding only
a touch of purple foliage. When Veronica caught him with a Killaspray in the
twilight, the two of them realised that a garden can become grounds for
divorce. Since then, separate spheres have been the answer. Half of the
garden is trimmed, edged and given over to Julian's growing taste for
clipped hebes. The other half has meadow planting in which vetch twines
among Evening Primrose and white-flowered Lavatera Barnsley.
Gardens should breed unity, not division, but what really alarms Julian is
that this taste for the hedgerow has spread to the cooking. No weekend seems
safe, nowadays, from one of Veronica's forays for food from the wild: they
have had nettle soup, dandelion salad, and she seems to believe everything
she reads in Richard Mabey's old best-seller, Food for Free. The trouble has
been compounded by a reunion with her old friend, Tiffany. She asked
Veronica up for one of her fund-raising evenings for the Marsden Hospital,
but for once Veronica did not return overwhelmed with nostalgia for her old
Chelsea comfort-area. Instead, she returned with a new zeal and plans to
make ice-creams from the worst weeds in the English hedgerow.
According to Tiffany, who is very conscious of the planet's future, this
last week in June is the golden moment for an ice sorbet, the main
ingredients of which can be gathered free from any hedgerow in England.
All you need are 15 to 20 heads of fully-opened flowers of an elder bush,
preferably gathered on a sunny day when they are most strongly scented.
Veronica swears by a Josceline Dimbleby recipe. It involves buyinga pound of
gooseberries, topping and tailing them, heating them up with the elder
flowers, a spoonful of lemon juice and water, and then letting this mixture
cool. Next, you should add two-thirds of a pint of cream, whipped until
stiff but not thick; mix the cream into the syrupy mixture and let the
wholething cool for several hours in a freezer.
To Veronica's eye, the hedgerows this weekend are a foaming mass of
greenish-yellow potential ice-cream, being ignored by the British public,
who go shopping for highly-priced raspberries instead. To Julian, there is
now a threat of elder among his clipped walks of purple lilacs; dinner
parties, this weekend, have a definite air of tension.
On a trial run, the elder flower ice-cream turned out very oddly. This
weekend, Julian is trying to ease tension with a simpler alternative from
his days of bachelor cooking.
What country people knew yesterday Sloane-Wallys recycle for today's
weekend, and so Veronica and Julian find themselves arguing about how best
to make a pudding out of a plant which, five years ago, they were poisoning
to death with SBK. First, it was the design; now it is the cooking.
Gardening is not a bed of roses, and once the hedgerow look intrudes, there
is nothing - not even a sorbet - at which its converts will not stop.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Gardening: Geraniums improve their status - A look at the
increase in hardy varieties
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HARDY geraniums have increased quite remarkably in public favour over the
past few years. It seems only a short time ago that they were regarded
widely as second-class herbaceous perennials and rock plants, useful for
their reliability and for the good ground-covering qualities of some
varieties but attracting scarcely any specialist attention.
Now, it is quite different. There are four national collections of
geraniums, the largest in the lovely garden that Marjorie Fish made at East
Lambrook Manor, South Petherton, Somerset. This has been maintained by
Andrew Norton and his wife, who have enlarged the nursery which has been
attached to the garden for many years. Their collection has 250 species and
garden varieties.
This is 100 more than the second-largest, which belongs to Rosemary Lee at
Coombland Gardens, Coneyhurst, Billingshurst, West Sussex. She also runs a
nursery, but that is open by appointment only. There are plenty of other
nurseries, both specialist and general, that hold good stocks of geraniums
and they seem to be increasing all the time as demand grows.
Hardy geraniums are related to pelargoniums, much used in conservatories and
for summer bedding outdoors. They are commonly, but wrongly, called
geraniums; pelargoniums are not hardy. A few geraniums are genuine native
plants. Some have been introduced to gardens and have produced useful
varieties which have been given distinguishing names. There are also a
number of species, introduced from other countries, that have liked British
conditions so well that they have jumped the garden fence and established
themselves in the wild.
One of these is G. sanguineum, which grows wild on sand dunes where it makes
prostrate carpets of dark green, deeply-divided leaves studded with magenta
flowers. It is a fine plant in its own right although rather a harsh colour;
but in gardens it has produced several varieties, including one named
lancastriense which is a delicate pink. Another, less-prostrate variety,
with bright pink flowers, is called Shepherd's Warning. All these are small
enough to be planted in rock gardens, or they can be used as edgings to
borders where they can be kept under control easily.
Very different is G. macrorhizum, a foot-high rambler with clammy, aromatic
leaves and clusters of small pink flowers which vary quite a lot in shade.
The best, I think, is Ingwersen's Variety, and it is widely available. The
leaves turn bronzy-red in the autumn - and it has leaves all year, so that
it makes excellent ground cover. Although it spreads rapidly, it can be
pulled out very easily if it strays too far.
Another fine native species is the Meadow Cranesbill, G. pratense. In the
wild it is always found on chalk or limestone; in the garden it does not
seem to mind if the soil is alkaline or moderately acid. It is 2 ft or more
in height with deeply-divided, very attractive leaves and loose sprays of
violet-blue flowers. But the colour is variable, and I have grown one with
pearl-grey flowers, which I find very attractive.
Johnson's Blue is much like G. pratense and is, in fact, a seedling from it,
probably pollinated accidentally from another species. The flowers are a
particularly fine deep violet-blue; but there is obviously some confusion
about this variety as, in trying to buy plants of it, I have collected three
quite different things from different nurseries.
Cranesbill is a popular name that can be used for all the hardy geraniums.
It refers to the seed vessels, which are long and pointed like a beak. They
remain decorative long after the flowers fade.
There are several middle-height geraniums for the centre of the border. Two
of the best are G. ibericum and G. magnificum, but I find them so alike that
I actually cannot be sure of the difference. Both have deeply-divided leaves
and large, violet-blue flowers.
G. himalayense is a little shorter and also has large violet-blue flowers,
but with a deeper centre. There is an excellent double-flowered variety of
this. G. renardii is worth growing for its foliage which is rounded,
deeply-veined and sage-green. The flower colour is off-white with purple
veining.
Two eye-catchers that can reach 3 ft are G. phaeum which, in its most
popular form, has very deep maroon flowers and is known as Mourning Widow;
and G. psilotstemon, which is a gay magenta with a darker centre. G.
endressii is a cheerful ramper which makes ideal ground cover up to 18
inches thick and is covered for much of the summer with rather small, clear
pink flowers.
The best form for colour is Wargrave. Like G. macrorhizum, it is pulled out
readily if it strays too far and it is one of the easiest plants to increase
by division.
For the rock garden, or for growing on a dry wall made with plenty of soil
in place of mortar, several varieties of G. cinereum are ideal. These have
grey-green leaves, greyer in some varieties than others. The best forms, all
called subcaulescens, have abundant magenta flowers.
If you want the very brightest of the lot, look for the additional name
Splendens. This really is a splendid plant for establishing on a grey stone
wall. Look also for Ballerina, which has grey leaves and pale lilac,
purple-veined flowers.
Yet another pretty, creeping kind is G. Buxton's Blue, the which has light
blue flowers with white centres. Unfortunately, this is one of the very few
that can be a little difficult to grow, and it should be put in a place
where the drainage is first class.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ARTHUR HELLYER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This is one of the numerous garden varieties of Mock Orange which vary
greatly in height, size of flower and the number of petals per bloom, and
also in fragrance. Belle Etoile is deliciously scented and throws its
perfume a long way. The flowers are single, pure white with a small purple
blotch in the centre, and are carried freely in good clusters. It averages 5
feet in height and a little more in diameter but can be kept smaller by
pruning immediately after flowering when the old flowering stems can be cut
out but the new growth retained or, at most, thinned a little. Other notably
good varieties in this group are Beauclerk, Manteau d'hermine, Sybille, all
with single flowers, and Virginal, with double flowers.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Property: Ring of murky water - The attractions of moated
houses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THEY were more aesthetic than defensive; even so, the moats that formed a
ring of murky water round country houses in East Anglia certainly kept out
all but the most determined villain.
Essex has more moats than any other UK county - at least 1,000. It seems
that the yeoman farmers of that county a few centuries ago were as
status-orientated as Essex man is today.
The purpose of the moat remains something of a mystery. Certainly the
labourers who toiled to dig them would have given a week's supply of mead
for the loan of a modern JCB. At castles such as Leeds, near Maidstone in
Kent, the moat was entirely defensive; but by the time the 15th century
mortar was dry at places such as Wingfield Castle, in Suffolk, military
strategy had made the water virtually obsolete.
So why were the moats built? Certainly they helped to guide visitors to the
correct entrance; they also kept farm and wild animals in their place - a
sort of liquid ha-ha.
The water was a source of food in hard times, carp and pike being popular in
those days; and was useful in the event of fire. Rainwater (and goodness
knows what else) was drained into the moat.
It seems the moat was a status symbol - the medieval equivalent of a Porsche
in the drive. People strove to build bigger ones than their neighbours. All
sizes appeared. But when does a moat cease to be a moat? When it is less
than five metres in diameter, apparently; it is a ditch.
It may be that the soil dug from the moat was used to raise the foundation
level of the house, and certainly in some cases the clay dug from it would
have been used to bake the bricks for the building; bricks were often made
in situ.
That is possibly a reason for the existence of the moat at The Kingston Wood
Estate, a beautiful manor house close to Cambridge, with a red-brick Queen
Anne facade and a most unusual linenfold panel front door. The moat encloses
more than three quarters of the immaculate gardens.
Kingston Wood is the 1,100 acre home of Sir Alexander and Lady Reid, who
have spent nearly 30 years lovingly developing the garden. They are moving
north and so the property is being offered by Bidwells (0223-841841). The
whole estate in several lots is expected to sell for Pounds 2.75m but the
house and 200 acres (plus the moat) can be had for Pounds 1.3m.
The house, its ground floor walls nearly one metre thick in places, is a
tangible history of English architecture; the entire roof was raised about
one metre at some stage. The present structure dates from the late 15th
century.
There is a fine moat at the aptly named Moat Farm at Dallinghoo, close to
Woodbridge, in Suffolk. The 16th century timber farmhouse, with five
bedrooms and 13 acres of orchards and paddocks, is being offered by Strutt
and Parker (071-629-7282) for Pounds 255,000.
The same agent is selling Old Hall Farm in Huntington, close to Chester,
with moated gardens plus frontage to the River Dee. For the past three years
the property has been run as a rare breeds and craft centre. Old Hall is
offered for sale now, lock, stock, hamsters and Peruvian Yacatan pigs for
Pounds 650,000.
Still on the subject of water, Bidwells is offering The Old Rectory which is
on the River Cam at at Fen Ditton, near Cambridge, and enjoys a front stalls
view of the college bumps races every June.
This is a large but friendly house that has evolved over the centuries and
has nearly every type of window. The largest part of the house is of Queen
Anne origin. The property sits on the prehistoric Fleam Dyke, the fortified
boundary of the fens. A price guide of Pounds 650,000 is suggested.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Property: There's more to Surrey than suburbs - David Hoppit
finds signs of recovery in 'commuter county'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID HOPPIT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPRING WAS a little late this year in Surrey, the southern England county of
the London commuter. The daffodils may have bloomed on time, but the housing
market buds were two months late, delayed not a little by the UK general
election. That, at least, is the impression of Ken Cook, of Hamptons
Messenger May, in Guildford. However, he now believes that the market has
picked up to such an extent that the customary summer lull may not occur.
Surrey is full of surprises. Striding or riding along the North Downs, high
above valleys and secret villages, it is easy to forget that suburbia
reposes below. Some 8,000 listed buildings, approached by private drives,
hide behind high beech hedges and rhododendrons.
When William Cobbett, author of Rural Rides, travelled through Betchworth,
Brockham and Dorking in October 1825 he wrote: 'There are few prettier rides
in England, and the weather was beautifully fine'. The comment about the
weather was well-founded; there is just enough rain (25 in annually, on
average) to stop the rhododendrons and hydrangeas wilting, but not enough to
spoil the bowls, tennis and golf that abound in Surrey. Gardeners delight in
the fertile soil, even though they may never aspire to the standards of the
300-acre Royal Horticultural Society gardens at Wisley.
The village of Brockham remains a pleasant corner of the county; the green,
on which WG Grace, the legendary cricketer, amassed some of his 54,000 runs,
is little changed, but common sense and the car demanded wider boundaries,
so a fine new cricket field has been allocated.
Brockham's charm lies in its whole; as with many Surrey villages there is no
outstanding single building - even the mortar and chalk 'clunch' church is
no more than a fair example of the Victorian period, the mortar being
scarcely dry when the good doctor was smiting leather with willow.
Close to the new cricket square, Fairbriar Homes is adding considerably to
the number of homes in Brockham at its Middle Green development. Prices
range from Pounds 93,450 for a two-bedroom flat up to Pounds 275,000 for a
five-bedroom detached house.
Surrey is often a barometer for the UK property market. There is something
for most pockets, but in spite of the recession this is still stockbroker
territory. Those who have really made it tend to head for St George's Hill,
a 1,000-acre estate of 365 grand houses on a ridge 200 ft above sea level.
Surrey is truly the land of the commuter; in spite of redundancies in the
past 18 months, leading to a fall of nearly 10 per cent in the number of
journeys, some 160,000 still travel by rail to London every day. Times must
be tougher, however - Haslemere, which always boasted the UK's highest
percentage of first class ticket holders, has recently lost its status to
Winchfield.
John Slatter, of Churchods, points to a noticeable rise in house sales
during the first five months of the year compared with 1991. Coupled with
that is a reduction of 10 per cent in instructions - result: greater
competition for fewer homes. There is, according to Guy Warren, of John D.
Wood, a pent-up demand for good houses, with expatriates and those in rented
accommodation competing with existing home owners wanting to trade up.
Defining the boundaries of commuter-county is not easy. For the past 20
years even the headquarters of the county council has been outside Surrey,
in Kingston-upon-Thames. Several other towns, including Richmond, Croydon,
Sutton, Merton, Cheam and even Surbiton ('Suburbiton', to some) are not
officially in Surrey, though the Post Office recognises them as such.
More than anything else it was the 19th century development of the railways
that lead to the development of the county. Tiny hamlets became bustling
towns. Purley, now part of the London Borough of Croydon, was a rural area
known as Foxley Hatch when the first steam trains chugged past on their way
from London to Brighton in 1841.
Wimbledon is just across the border from Surrey now, but as all eyes are now
be on the hallowed courts this is the time to mention some fine new houses
that have just been built there. Octagon's development of large detached
houses at Marryat Road, a mis-hit top-spin lob from the centre court, has
houses for between Pounds 295,000 and Pounds 950,000. Agents Hamptons says
it could easily find tenants prepared to pay Pounds 4,000 a month for the
larger homes.
For most, however, the charm of Surrey hides in its villages, many
approached by lanes beneath an enveloping canopy of trees, for in spite of
losing nearly 2m trees in the 1987 hurricane this is an umbriferous county.
There are contrasts, of course. One of the most charming villages is Shere,
with its 'Silent Pool' where it is said King John frightened to death a
maiden who was bathing there. Nearby is Box Hill, one of England's favourite
picnic spots. A five mile bridleway links the hill with Epsom Downs, scene
of the world-famous Derby since 1780. Higher still is Leith Hill, at nearly
1,000 ft above sea level the highest point in the south east.
So there is a lot more to Surrey than suburbia, and if we are to believe
agents such as Savills and builders like St George and Berkeley Homes, this
is the time to go house hunting.
Among the current crop of temptations on Savills' books is Spreakley House,
at Frensham, close to a large lake that was so conspicuous a landmark during
the Second World War that it had to be drained. The Elizabethan house, with
its cottage, ancient barn and more than five acres (with tennis court and
swimming pool, of course) has a price guide of Pounds 800,000.
Still up in the price stratosphere is Crooksbury House, near Farnham, which
was the first country house designed by Sir Edwin Lutyens. The house, valued
at around Pounds 1.25m by Aylesford, was built by the famous architect in
1890 and extended eight years later. It is largely unchanged, but someone
wanting to update the interior could live in one of the immaculate cottages
within the 15 acre grounds, says the agent.
The Square House at Hindhead sounds more of a snip at Pounds 325,000, the
price suggested by agent John D. Wood. The house was built in 1926 and has
six bedrooms, 2.5 acres and a proper pantry and wine store. The agent
originally sold the house to the late owner 22 years ago, and in her will
she requested that it acted as trustee.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Walking over England: a foot-slogger's diary - Charles
Leadbeater braved blisters, fell-runners and bed and breakfast accommodation
galore in a coast to coast marathon
</HEADLINE>

St Bees Head to Ennerdale Bridge, 14 1/4 miles.
A HUGE jellyfish washed up on the ribs of sand on the beach at St Bee's Head
formed my starting point as I set out to cross England to the North Sea. I
headed up the steep cliff path, decked in flowers, which marks the edge of
the bleak industrial belt of Cumbria in north west England.
I was steered to and then away from the Whitehaven chemical works - which
announces itself with billowing smoke and violent eruptions of effluent in
the sea hundreds of feet below - into a string of working class villages,
the rows of terraced houses unrelieved by the comforting homogeneity of
tourism. No welcoming signs offered bed and breakfast or bar meals; these
are enclosed, hard places. A man working on his allotment next to the River
Ehen confided: 'It took a long time to put down roots. For 10 years after I
moved here I was desperately unhappy.'
From the village of Cleator and over the rounded hill of Dent one descends
into the hidden valley of Nannycatch, its steep sides threaded by a stream
which leads into Ennerdale, the gateway to the grandeur of the Lake
District.
Ennerdale Bridge to Rosthwaite. 14 1/2 miles.
From the farm where I had lodged for the night, I skirted the lake, so still
that it might have been newly-laid that morning. Walkers emerged from tents
along the way which leads into Ennerdale forest. I escaped the pained whine
of an industrial saw only when I climbed up on to the fells, drinking most
of my meagre water supply in the sun's glare on a saddle of land just below
the peak of Great Gable.
After lunch I scrambled down the scree of Aaron's Slack to sleep in the
afternoon sun by Sty Head Tarn. My little toes were starting to ache, my
mouth was parched, my pack felt every pound of its 40lb weight. The pains
grew in step with my anticipation of a cup of tea at the cafe at Seathwaite
farm. At the bottom I found walker's nightmare No. 1: the cafe was closed.
Rosthwaite to Patterdale Bridge, 17 3/4 miles.
I breakfasted in my guest house with Noel, 70 years old, disabled by a
stroke, passionately jealous of my ability to walk. He is one of a
generation for whom rambling in hills is not just walking but a joyous
release from urban entrapment.
Beyond the cloud which hung on the floor of Langstrathdale I clambered up to
the lip of Green Up Edge. It proved to be walker's nightmare No. 2: a series
of plausible false horizons, each beckoning as the end of the climb, each
disappointing, until a flat stretch of ground opened out on to a view of the
easy descent to Grasmere.
A steady ascent from the tourist village where the poet William Wordsworth
lived led to Grisedale Tarn; it provided, in blazing sun, a collective
swimming pool below the mighty bulk of the mountain Helvellyn. Here three
public school boys were upstaged by a working-class lad - after taking the
plunge he announced to the hillside thronged with walkers: 'It's a good job
I'm wearing my thermal jockstrap.'
Walker's nightmare No. 3 passed me on the long descent to Patterdale: a
60-something fell runner with enough breath to give me a cheery greeting as
he swept past for his evening run up to the tarn and back.
Patterdale to Shap. 16 miles.
My bed and breakfast was a bungalow called The Struggle, so named after the
battle the owners fought with the Lake District planning board to get it
built. The board insisted upon Lakeland slate for the roof. At Pounds 1,800
a tonne, the 11-tonne roof must be one of the most valuable bungalow roofs
in the UK.
A long traverse took me to the peak of the High Street range, the
easternmost edge of the Lake District. The steep descent to the ugly,
half-full Haweswater reservoir tormented my frail calf muscles as I tried to
compensate for blisters on my heels by putting more weight on my toes.
Result: blistered toes and wrecked calf muscles. Hobbling along the
reservoir shore I was joined by walker's nightmare No. 4: an 18-year-old
travelling at jogging speed. At Shap, in a newsagent well stocked in
walkers' medicaments, I acquired some magic spray which I liberally applied
to my calf muscles. I slept for 12 hours.
Shap to Kirkby Stephen. 22 miles.
The magic spray seemed to have restored some spring to my legs as I crossed
the M6 motorway and headed over the rolling limestone hills into the
delightful village of Orton. A stunning traverse along an escarpment showed
the way to Kirkby Stephen, but after 16 miles my legs began to collapse, my
knees grinding like unoiled gears beneath the weight of my rucksack.
Kirkby Stephen to Keld. 12 3/4 miles.
At breakfast in the Black Bull inn the landlady fussed over two huge farmers
who had driven overnight from Devon to buy sheep at the town market that
day. Between massive mouthfuls they complained bitterly about the depths to
which sheep prices had fallen.
The walking was becoming more painful. As I entered Keld, a tiny village at
the head of the Swale, my walking style was that of a human beetle. But I
had reached half-way.
Martin and Olwyn, owners of my bed and breakfast stop for the night, had
previously run a pub in Basingstoke but had fallen foul of recession. Now
they virtually spit at the mention of the town's name. I admitted -
sheepishly - that Basingstoke was my home town.
Keld to Reeth. 11 1/4 miles.
I was driven back to Keld to rejoin the path. It was flat, easy walking
beside the Swale; part of the route followed the old Corpse Way, along which
mourners used to carry the dead from churchless Keld, to be buried at Reeth.
That evening in the King's Arms in Reeth all the walkers on the coast to
coast route gathered spontaneously - accountants, builders, library clerks -
to exchange tales of woe, anecdotes and horror stories about blisters.
Reeth to Bolton-on-Swale. 16 miles.
After a hearty breakfast I found it easy to walk the 10 gentle miles to
Richmond by lunchtime, following the banks of the Swale until a gentle climb
took me into the town's narrow streets and alleyways. Richmond stands at the
mouth of the Yorkshire dales as they open out on to the flat expanse of the
Vale of Mowbray. Beyond Richmond the Swale is despoiled, polluted, dirty,
dank. Along one stretch I spied a man about his Sunday afternoon pleasure,
violently wielding a huge spade above a rabbit hole, ready to smash the
skull of the stricken animal as it was driven out by ferrets.
Bolton on Swale to Ingleby Cross. 19 miles.
I breakfasted with a criminal court judge from Portland, Oregon, who
revelled in recounting the tale of how his boss had had his Dollars 60,000
sports car stolen at knife point. After about two miles walking I met Derek
and Edith, part of a seven-strong team from Northamptonshire police, doing
the cross-coast walk for charity. They said they were disillusioned with
what they saw as the de-professionalisation of police work, and planned to
start their own business: photographing weddings.
That afternoon, ploughing across the Vale's flat broad acres, came the first
rain of the walk, which accompanied me into Ingleby Cross. I had nowhere to
stay, but on hearing this the woman running the Post Office put me up in her
spare room.
Ingleby Cross to Clay Bank Top. 12 1/4 miles
A beautiful undulating walk in crisp air and sharp sun took me along a ridge
of the Cleveland Hills, broken by granite outcrops, with clear views up to
the chemical and steel plants of Redcar and Middlesborough to the north.
It was so exhilarating that at the day's end I gladly walked an extra two
miles to my stopping place, a farm B&amp;B run by a resourceful woman who told
me that she was the first woman priest in the north-east of England. The
farm was started in 1938 by the lady vicar's father, who sat in the living
room, paralysed by a stroke. He asked me to tell him when the Second World
War was, as if he were finding out for the first time.
Clay Bank Top to Glaisdale. 18 3/4 miles.
Urra Moor was covered in mist and blown by driving rain. Utterly alone, I
set my face into the wind as if to cleanse myself. After four miles, I
reached Bloworth Crossing. Headlights emerged out of the mist. At first I
thought it was an army convoy on manoeuvres, but it turned out to be a
column of 16 vehicles in a shooting party. Later, a helicopter swept over to
deliver the host, Rocco Forte, the leisure industries millionaire.
A comfortable walk along the long-disused track of the old Rosedale iron
mine railway led me to the famous Lion Inn at Blakey, windswept and alone on
the moor. The police team arrived, disorganised: one was very ill and two
failed to make it because they had got so drunk the night before.
Glaisdale to Robin Hood's Bay. 19 miles.
I stretched out the last day of my walk for as long as possible. I chatted
to a local farmer, who pointed out how years of drought were killing the
trees and hedges. I gazed at the giant 'golf ball' buildings of Fylingdales,
an early warning system against nuclear attack made defunct by the collapse
of the Soviet Union. And finally, I ambled down Eskdale, across the moors
and along the cliff-tops into the fishing village of Robin Hood's Bay, where
I joined a stream of smiling walkers soaking their feet in the sea.
My journey - almost 200 miles - was over. As I rested, six men ran down to
the sea at a pace which I could not have maintained for more than 20
minutes. The walk had taken me 16 days - they had run it in six. It did not
matter. I was content to feel that I knew at least one path through England.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Minding Your Own Business: Pin-stripe acupuncturist -
Heather Farmbrough meets a private-sector physiotherapist
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HEATHER FARMBROUGH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN HIS pin-striped trousers, plain shirt and tie, Tony Monkcom looks more
like a City dealer than an acupuncturist or physiotherapist.
He and his wife Alison (also a chartered physiotherapist) own and run the
Kingston Clinic of Physiotherapy and Complementary Therapies, offering both
conventional and 'alternative' therapies. In spite of their keen interest in
complementary medicine, making a profit matters as much as making people
better.
Indeed, the clinic has made a profit each year since it opened - but it has
been six years of careful saving and late-night book-keeping sessions. Like
many physios, Tony supplemented his income by treating a few patients
privately after he qualified as a chartered physiotherapist in 1980. Using
his fees, he spent Pounds 600 on an ultrasound machine - then a rarity in
many NHS hospitals - to treat soft tissue injuries to muscles, ligaments and
tendons.
While working in hospitals in Windsor and Ascot, he became interested in
acupuncture after observing that some problems, such as acute low back and
neck pain, migraine headaches, sinusitis and certain forms of arthritis, did
not respond to conventional treatments. After a two year part-time training
course, he qualified as an acupuncturist in 1987.
He had continued to treat private patients in the evenings. But the local
council refused him permission to use his home as a surgery on the grounds
that car parking would be a problem.
So Tony moved to Kingston, where he bought an Edwardian three-bedroomed
semi-detached house with a large reception room he could use as a treatment
room. In a new area he had to start building a reputation all over again.
He visited all the local businesses and shops, and wrote to all the local
GPs and dentists. But it was only after he had visited a number of general
practice managers that local doctors started to refer patients to him for
physiotherapy.
Tony meticulously followed up every patient's first consultation with a
letter to their GP, whether or not they had been referred. 'I had to build
up a reputation quickly,' he says. 'I knew I had to get people better fast.'
To compete with other private practitioners, he needed good, up-to-date
medical equipment. But he had to buy it gradually, and has always, except
for the mortgage on his house, refused to borrow. His most expensive items
have been a Pounds 3,000 interferential therapy machine (treatment with this
feels like pins and needles, and transmits an electronic frequency to
relieve problems with joints, low back pain, or tennis elbow), and an Pounds
2,500 laser machine (which treats damaged tissues with a concentrated light
beam). Altogether, he has spent nearly Pounds 22,050 on medical equipment,
furniture and word processing software and hardware.
After a couple of years he wanted to expand his client base and began to
offer acupuncture, and then complex homeopathy, which combines a number of
low potency homeopathic and herbal remedies.
'I send a lot of people to the Kingston clinic because Tony Monkcom is a
good clinician in his own right and can offer a wide range of therapies,'
says a local GP. 'I don't see it as an alternative to the NHS because the
NHS can't offer that range of treatments."
In 1987, Alison moved in and became the practice manager, and Tony took on
two part-time physiotherapists. A podiatrist - a chiropodist who specialises
in lower limb and foot problems - runs a clinic one afternoon a week. This
has increased the number of clients - and clinic revenue - but it has
created other pressures, too.
'The headaches start when you employ other people,' says Tony. 'When you
treat people yourself, it's important to be a good practitioner. When you
employ others, you have to be a good manager as well.'
Some 60 per cent of clients come through referrals from GPs and consultants;
a similar proportion use private health insurance schemes to pay for
acupuncture and physiotherapy. The waiting time for appointments is usually
a week, sometimes 10 days; at local hospitals the waiting time for
non-emergency treatments can vary from two to 12 weeks.
There are currently some 2,000 to 3,000 patients on the books. This May,
Tony took out a five-year lease and moved the clinic to a 750 square foot
bungalow at Ham Common which now houses just the practice. This has allowed
him to add a couple of treatment and to separate home from work. He intends
to start marketing the clinic with a series of talks for local GPs and
consultants: the goal is to build a network of practices.
The Monkcoms are conscious that private patients expect good service. They
try not to let patients wait more than five minutes for appointments. and
patients are never called by their first names. Medications are dispatched
speedily.
By staying away from the more extreme fringes of alternative medicine, the
clinic has avoided a 'crank' reputation and stayed on good terms with local
doctors. What counts, ultimately, is the ability to make patients better.
The Kingston clinic certainly cured my tennis elbow last summer.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Pension purchase fears - Company
pension managers are becoming worried by the sales of inappropriate personal
schemes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Pension fund managers fear that evidence of Robert Maxwell's raids on
pension schemes of companies under his control is being used to induce
people, particularly those who have just been made redundant, into mistaken
purchases of personal pensions.
Company scheme managers feel frustrated by the present rules which prevent
them from advising members but have allowed thousands of inappropriate sales
to take place.
The harm done may not be apparent for some years, but they say that
disciplinary action by Lautro (Life Assurance and Unit Trust Regulatory
Organisation) now under way will not address this basic flaw.
Paul Trickett, head of pensions at the Mineworkers' Pension Scheme, said
some 12,000 of the 16,000 miners leaving the industry last year had
transferred into personal pensions. The scheme had paid out Pounds 400m in
transfers, implying around Pounds 30m worth of sales commission.
Trickett said a number of insurance companies had recruited former miners as
salesmen, sending them to sell pensions to former workmates after just two
weeks' training.
'We get relatively elderly men - some over 55 - who would have had a
guaranteed indexed pension for life and for their widows with the Miners'
Pension Scheme. They transfer out, and that has got to be poor advice,' he
said.
Trickett added that in some cases miners still working had left the scheme
to take out rebate-only pensions without life insurance cover.
'It cannot be best advice for someone in the mining industry to have no
death-in-service or disability benefits,' he said.
Barred by the Financial Services Act from giving advice to members on
transfers, the miners' scheme is considering arranging free access to
independent advice on a non-commission basis.
The scheme provides all leavers with a leaflet setting out questions that
pension salesmen should be asked.
Until recently, the leaflet included a statement which, the scheme
suggested, salesmen should be asked to sign, confirming that in respect of
the cash equivalent transfer value from the MPS, the pension plan supplied
would provide 'no less benefit than you would have been entitled to had you
kept your benefits with the Miners Pension Scheme.'
'No personal pension provider could sign that,' said Steve Conley, pension
product manager at Refuge, who acknowledged that salesmen's failure to sign
had put a brake on sales to former miners. However, the Miners' Pension
Scheme had dropped the statement from its latest leaflet, partly because
nobody ever signed it.
Mark Adams, of Rank Xerox pensions, said that the group had published a
booklet specifically dealing with pension transfers after becoming concerned
at seeing members with deferred pensions withdrawing substantial amounts of
capital when this was really not appropriate.
The Rank Xerox booklet explains that the group cannot give advice on
transfer decisions. It suggests that scheme members should 'if necessary
consult a financial adviser who will be able to give . . . objective
advice'. But Adams expressed doubts about some brokers claiming to be
independent but apparently putting 99 per cent of their business through one
company.
'There are very few cases you can salvage,' he said. 'It seems when people
talk to brokers all we get is the request when the member has already signed
a transfer form.'
At Pilkington, Robert Neate, the group pensions manager, said that
salesmen's attempts to persuade early leavers out of the scheme seemed
particularly cut-throat.
He recalled a battle with a large assurance company over an advertisement
run earlier this year in the legal and public notices sections of local St
Helens papers.
'ATTENTION All past employees of Pilkingtons, UG Glass, Cromptons, Bury
Times, NHS, Fords, Marks &amp; Spencer and any other major company whether you
are currently employed or unemployed,' read the advertisement. 'Call Eric,
it could be to your financial advantage.'
Requests for transfers into the personal pensions scheme resulted, but quite
a few were from people already receiving Pilkington pensions, while other
were from former employees who had taken cash refunds in the days before
preservation of benefits.
Neate pointed out that under the Financial Services Act, although he could
give generic advice, he would be committing an offence to recommend the
products of A over B.
'It seems some of the big pensions companies do not see themselves as bound
in this way when perhaps they should,' he said. 'They do not allow lack of
knowledge of our schemes to stand in their way when they trawl for
business.'
'Whatever the theory underlying the financial services legislation, too
often the fact is that the member's or former member's interests are
forgotten when there are commissions to be had,' said Neate, who succeeded
in getting the advertisement withdrawn only after threatening to inform both
Lautro and the FT.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WAS an error in the reply 'Miras on two homes' given last week. The
correct reply is as follows: As a married couple, you and your husband can
receive mortgage interest tax relief on only one property even if the house
is your main residence and the flat is his main residence. It makes no
difference whose names the properties are in. Usually where a married couple
own two properties, one of them will be their joint main residence (in your
case probably the house). If in fact you and your husband will have separate
main residences, the one you bought first will be treated as your joint main
residence for mortgage interest relief purposes.
This tie-breaker rule to which this refers is at Section 356B(5) ICTA 1988.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: CGT and IoM bonds
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IN 1979 I purchased two single premium life insurance bonds from an
insurance company registered in the Isle of Man. I was, at the time, a UK
citizen in long-term overseas employment, had gone through official Bank of
England emigration procedure some years before, and was accepted by the
Inland Revenue as not resident and not ordinarily resident in the UK.
From 1972 onwards I owned houses in the UK and Spain, both available for
occupation. In 1980 medical problems led me to retire to Spain, and
subsequently to the UK where I have become resident.
My enquiry relates to the tax status of the Isle of Man policies. I have
been told that if I encash them I will be liable to income tax on the gain,
in the year of encashment, but subject to 'top slicing relief' as if they
were normal UK single premium bonds. To date I have not drawn any income
from the bonds, or dealt with them in any way.
1. Is my understanding that the bonds are treated in a similar manner to
normal UK single premium bonds correct?
2. What would be the tax position (income, capital gains, inheritance) if I
transferred ownership to my wife and she later cashed the bonds, during my
lifetime or after my death?
3. Would a transfer to my wife trigger any form of tax liability?
4. What would be the tax position if the bonds remain in my ownership until
my death (ie what would be the position for my executors)?
1. Yes - because the policies were issued before November 18 1983.
2. Surrender: Income tax on the excess of the proceeds over the premium,
subject to top-slicing relief from higher-rate tax (currently 15 per cent)
but not from age surcharge (currently 12 1/2 per cent).
Death: Income tax on the excess of the surrender value (before your death)
over the premium, subject to topslicing relief as on surrender.
3. No.
4. Income tax as though you had surrendered the policies immediately before
dying. IHT as part of your estate.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Briefcase, Q&amp;A: Unlucky numbers
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
I WONDER if you could tell me the odds of winning a single prize on ERNIE
(the Premium Bond computer) with a holding of Pounds 10,000 in 10,000
consecutive numbers over a period of two years.
After the first year of no prizes, I wrote to the Bond Office to check the
numbers' validity. This was confirmed. Another year later, I have still not
won anything from this maximum holding.
According to the National Savings you have been 'quite phenomenally
unlucky'. On each monthly draw, someone with your holding has ten chances in
11 of winning at least one prize. Thus, by the law of averages, over 11
months you would expect to win ten prizes. Not to win any in 24 months, when
you might have expected to win 21, stretches the bounds of probability to
the limit.
However, ERNIE is random, according to National Savings - numbers are
computer-generated, and the fact that occasionally someone is as unlucky as
you have been only proves that ERNIE is random.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Not just a black and white choice -
Investing in . . . South Africa
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH AFRICA forces a personal investor to face a unique dilemma. Any
decision you make will not just be based on investment merits, for in the
past two decades the climate of world opinion about the country has ensured
that any such move must involve ethical and political judgments as well.
Even those who had no qualms about investing in a nation governed by
apartheid still had to assess the stability of the regime. The effect of
sanctions imposed on the nation's economy also remains to be weighed.
The ideal scenario is for South Africa to transfer peacefully to a regime
which the rest of the world can stomach. This would leave the strengths of
the nation's economy intact and, by allowing sanctions to be lifted, allow
greater economic vigour.
Optimism that this could happen has grown since the release from prison of
Nelson Mandela, leader of the African National Congress, in early 1990.
However, it remains only a vague sentiment as far as big UK investors are
concerned.
Trustees of charity funds have slowly begun to warm towards South Africa -
for example, David Edwards, of the charity investment management service at
Henderson Crosthwaite, says: 'What has tended to happen over the last year
is that trustees have become less averse to the inclusion of South Africa,
and that mirrors the sentiment of the average private client.'
However, this mood has not translated into active investment. Edwards
continues: 'Now that trustees are relaxing their attitude to South Africa,
investment fundamentals come back in. And I don't think many fund managers
have put money into South Africa because it hasn't looked right, even though
the political situation looks better.'
Stuart Bell, of Pensions Investment Research Consultants, surveyed UK
pension funds in 1990 and found that about half had some restriction on
investment in South Africa. Nothing much has happened since then - the only
local authority pension fund to change its policy was that of the London
borough of Brent, following loss of control by the Labour party.
'Basically, it's still a political football,' says Bell. 'From the
commercial outlook, there has been no reason for them to amend their views
anyway.'
As a legacy of South Africa's pariah status, there are few ways to buy
direct exposure to the country in the UK. Unit trusts are authorised by the
Securities and Investments Board to invest up to 100 per cent of their funds
in the Johannesburg stock exchange, but there are no 'South Africa' unit
trusts.
Funds in a commodities or gold unit trust, however, must almost inevitably
have a considerable stake in the country. M&amp;G's Gold &amp; General fund, for
example, has a holding of 32.8 per cent. But the commodity and energy sector
is not one of the unit trust industry's stars. Over the year to June, the
average trust in the sector lost 11.4 per cent, according to Finstat. Over
two years this figure was 22.6 per cent, and over five years, 33 per cent.
Mary d'Eon, manager of Providence Capitol's Gold unit trust, views the
current situation as a long-term negative, but adds: 'Any sort of strife in
South Africa may make the gold price rise, which is good for the companies
as well. I have a holding of 20 per cent in the major companies, and I will
not be selling it.'
A less risky route is to gain exposure via companies quoted in the UK. Even
'ethical' investors are now prepared to do this. The Merlin Ecology unit
trust polled its unitholders and found a large majority against direct
investment in South Africa until a 'one man, one vote' system has been
achieved. However, they were prepared to invest in a company which did more
than its competitors to introduce good employment practices, and so the fund
has invested in Reckitt &amp; Coleman.
Reinvestment in South Africa has only just started, which may explain the
market's muted reaction to the massacre in Boipatong last weekend. Mandela's
subsequent decision to withdraw from talks on democracy with the government
seemed to confirm the worst fears of the watching world, but the
Johannesburg Stock Exchange index fell a modest 42 points to 3,639, while
companies with overseas assets, such as Lonrho and Minorco, actually rose.
So, ethical arguments aside, is this the time to buy into South Africa? The
answer must be: definitely not.
Jonathan Martin Smith, of the South Africa and mining department of
stockbrokers Williams De Broe, is positive about the country, but says: 'You
have a deep recession in South Africa and the timetable for recovery is put
back by this violence. I'm not saying it's not at the bottom. I'm just
saying it's wise to wait.'
For the longer term he remains confident: 'The will is there on both sides
to make this succeed. We are not entering into a civil war situation.
Violence will not disappear. But the government and the ANC are powerful
enough to control it.'
South African exchange controls are another reason for staying put. There is
a separate currency for external investors, the financial rand, which is
usually at a substantial discount to the main commercial rand. Foreign
investors thus have a strong disincentive to sell, particularly in troubled
times, when the discount grows - it went up to 27 per cent following the
news of Boipatong.
So, South Africa needs to be watched. But those who do not already have
exposure should keep it that way until the political situation is much
clearer.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Cash calls spark share sales -
Directors' Transactions
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS MACDONALD, Directus Ltd
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE PAST week has been marked by directors selling in order to meet personal
financial commitments. Martin Barber, the chairman, and Xavier Pullen, the
managing director of Capital and Regional Properties, sold 484,000 and
242,000 shares respectively at 110p for tax liabilities.
The sale of 8m shares by James Gommes, a non-executive director of Burford,
the property investment group, was made for personal financial reasons. And
at Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance brokers, five directors sold shares in
order to fulfil their obligations to Lloyd's of London.
Bodycote International, which manufactures industrial protective clothing,
has been performing strongly over the past year. Sales by the managing
director of operations in the Netherlands, and by Joseph Dwek, the chairman,
were made at prices around 440p. The Netherlands operations MD no longer
holds any stock in the company, but Dwek still retains a sizeable
proportion.
Racal Electronics has also been performing well following good final results
and director buying continues unabated. Michael Richardson, chief executive
of the electronic security division, has increased his holding by 100,000
shares at 67.5p
At Porter Chadburn three directors bought shares following a period of
relative underperformance and the announcement of final results. Raymond
Dinkin, the chairman, William Lazarus, the finance director and Patrick
Barrett, a non-executive director purchased a total of 121,000 shares at
prices between 30p and 88p.
Three directors of King and Shaxson, the discount house, were also buying.
David Pearce, the chairman, Ian Perkins, the managing director and James
Beard, a non-executive director all bought shares thereby increasing their
individual holdings considerably. Pearce recently replaced William d'Abbans
as chairman and prior to this purchase held no shares in the company.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Banks face challenge over teller
machines
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BARBARA ELLIS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BANKS and building societies face their most serious legal challenge from
customers over cash dispensing automated teller machines (ATMs), writes
Barbara Ellis.
This is in spite of words of comfort from the Building Society Ombudsmen
this week. They welcomed the new Pounds 50 limit introduced by the Code of
Banking Practice, on losses from unauthorised use of machines unless the
bank can prove fraud or gross negligence.
Some 400 customers assembled into an action group by J. Keith Park,
solicitors, of St Helens, Merseyside, are to seek a High Court ruling,
within the next two to three weeks, that banks and building societies
operating teller machines are in breach of contract because the machines are
susceptible to error and fraud.
Each of the 400 will make detailed claims for losses through alleged
unauthorised withdrawals ranging from Pounds 90 to Pounds 13,000 and
totalling close to Pounds 500,000. All the claims have been rejected by
banks and building societies.
For example, Barclays stated this week that out of its 15m machine
transactions each month, fewer than one in every 250,000 is disputed - which
would imply 60 disputes a month. Dennis Whalley, of J. Keith Park, says he
has deduced, from ATM dispute case numbers on Barclays' letters to
customers, that disputes have been running close to 9,000 a month.
Barclays says there is no correlation between the volume of teller machine
disputes and the reference numbers which relate to computer files.
For years banks and building societies have insisted that the ATM systems
are completely secure and that money can only be withdrawn with the use of a
card and personal identification number (PIN).
The ombudsmen have almost invariably backed the institutions in rejecting
claims from customers who detected 'phantom' unauthorised withdrawals,
saying that they must have unwittingly lost their cards, disclosed their PIN
number or been the victim of a dishonest family member.
However, the 1989 Jack report on banking acknowledged that the PIN system
was open to fraud and last year an engineer employed by the Clydesdale Bank
confessed to removing Pounds 17,000 from customers' accounts by arranging
phantom withdrawals using a hand-held computer.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: New issues: a taxing problem for stags
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID COHEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER the famine, the feast. The new issue market seemed never to have
recovered from the stock market crash of November 1987 but, suddenly,
investors have an embarrassment of riches.
Investors interested in this summer's crop of flotations - including
Wellcome, MFI, Taunton Cider, Kenwood and the Daily Telegraph - should bear
in mind the tax position if they are to profit to the full.
Capital Gains Tax will have an immediate impact on 'stags' - those who buy
new issues with the intention of making an instant profit by selling at the
first opportunity. The general rule is that if net gains for a tax year
exceed the annual exemption - currently Pounds 5,800 - CGT will be payable
on the excess at the taxpayer's marginal rate. Wives now have their own
exemption but a transfer to your spouse, immediately followed by a sale, may
provoke an Inland Revenue challenge.
In theory, the taxable gain will be reduced by any purchase commission
payable to a stockbroker or other agent but, in practice, new issues tend to
be acquired directly rather than via an intermediary.
Applicants will frequently be using borrowed funds, particularly on the more
popular issues where the only way to secure a reasonable allocation is to
apply for far more shares than you really want or, in many cases, can
afford. The bad news is that interest payments and other financing costs do
not qualify as deductible under CGT regulations.
The indexation allowance - which raises the base cost of an asset in line
with the increase in the Retail Prices Index over the period of ownership -
has become an invaluable CGT concession for longer-term shareholders but
will do little for stags. Although indexation usually starts to operate from
the first day of the month following acquisition, there is no allowance if
the shares are held for less than ten days.
Even those stags who are prepared to contemplate that degree of sale
deferral are hardly likely to be influenced in their decision by the
prospect of a measly one-month inflation linkage.
CGT can be avoided if the shares are injected into a personal equity plan
within 42 days of flotation, but using a Pep in this way will eat into the
investor's annual Pep allowances.
All this talk of capital gains has proceeded on the optimistic assumption
that gains will indeed be there for the taking. If previous new issues are
anything to go by, a fair number of burnt fingers should be anticipated. How
can disappointed stags mitigate their losses?
Losses can be set against capital gains for the same tax year and, to the
extent that such gains are insufficient, carried forward to future years.
But this will often mean that a taxpayer faces a large income tax bill on
his earnings and gets no immediate credit for his stock market losses.
There is a special statutory provision which allows losses on the sale of
newly-subscribed shares to be set against income, but it does not apply to
fully-quoted stocks. The dearth of USM flotations, and the raft of detailed
conditions which must be satisfied, make it unlikely that many of this
year's distressed stags will be able to take advantage of this.
If an offering is heavily oversubscribed, the only people to enjoy a real
slice of the action are likely to be the flotation company's employees. A
percentage of the issue will often be reserved for the workforce - nine of
last year's 11 offers for sale included this so-called 'priority' offer.
Participation in a priority offer will often be a valuable benefit. Take the
example of Northumbrian Water, the most popular of the water privatisations.
Local residents were rationed to just 200 shares each - outsiders got only
100 - whereas employees received all the shares for which they applied up to
a maximum of 5,000. So a lucky Geordie plumber who took full advantage could
have picked up an extra 4,800 shares. At the opening 60p premium, that would
have translated into a gain of almost Pounds 3,000.
Gains of this type are sheltax charge on employee benefits by an exemption
introduced in 1988. This is forfeited if more than 10 per cent of a share
offering is set aside for employees or if priority rights are skewed in
favour of directors or other higher-paid staff. In practice, every offer
made since 1988 has complied with these conditions.
Unfortunately, this privileged treatment is restricted to general offers for
sale. Employees whose companies join the market by way of a private placing
will be vulnerable to an attack from the Revenue if they pick up new shares
on favourable terms.
Even in an offer for sale, the taxman will show no mercy to executives who
pay less than the public for shares. Beneficiaries of a 'discount' offer
will pay income tax on the full amount of their discount.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: Ombudsmen's workload doubles -
Scheherazade Daneshkhu studies the increasing number of complaints
concerning building societies
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SCHEHERAZADE DANESHKHU
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
COMPLAINTS to building society ombudsmen have more than doubled over the
past year. There were 9,525 complaints and inquiries in the year to March
31, according to the scheme's annual report, compared to 4,451 in the
previous year. This is six times the figure for 1987-88, the scheme's first
year.
Stephen Edell, the first ombudsman, said he could not account for the 'flood
of complaints' and said the rise was even more remarkable since Abbey
National had become a bank in 1989 and therefore fell outside the
jurisdiction of the scheme.
A third ombudsman, Brian Murphy, was appointed last month to join Edell and
Jane Woodhead in coping with the workload.
There was also an increase in the number of cases taken up by the ombudsmen
from 642 to 1,070 over the same period. Formal decisions were made in 392
cases, of which 19 were resolved wholly in favour of the customer and 45
were 'partially' resolved in the complainant's favour.
The ombudsmen can make awards up to Pounds 100,000 though the largest
compensation that has so far been made is Pounds 25,000. Edell said most
awards made last year were in 'hundreds of pounds or the low thousands.'
Investment interest rates: The sharpest rise in complaints was about
interest rates on savings accounts, with over six times more complaints than
in 1990-91. Typically, a building society will launch a new account with
much publicity while closing an existing account to new investors. The new
account will usually pay higher rates of interest but those in the old
account are often unaware that there is a better replacement available.
Most of these complaints arose as a result of the launch by Nationwide
Anglia of its Bright Horizons investment range in late 1990 but Edell said
many other building societies operate in the same way.
He said that the onus was on investors to be 'vigilant' about their savings
but that building societies should make information about new accounts
'reasonably accessible'.
Repossessions: Complaints about mortgage repossessions increased by 171 per
cent over the year. Edell said there were few cases in which action could be
taken because the ombudsmen cannot stop repossessions nor can they deal with
cases handled by the courts.
The most common complaint was that properties had been sold too cheaply by
building societies, leaving the former home owner in debt to the building
society. The ombudsmen said that even if he were to award compensation in
some cases, he would not be able to stop this being set off by the society
against the amount owed by the borrower. Instant access accounts: If a
society advertises an account as instant access, the ombudsmen concluded
that the customer must have instant access to the cleared funds. In one
case, a family was short of money because the father was out of work. His
first pay cheque was wrongly coded by the paying bank and it was put into a
suspense account. The society said it could not make a withdrawal against
the cheque for a further three days. The ombudsman found in the
complainant's favour and his claim of Pounds 100 was reimbursed.
Errors in investment accounts: Societies sometimes credit or debit an
account by mistake, usually without informing the customer. In one case,
Pounds 1,000 was credited to a young man who thought the money had been sent
by his parents and proceeded to spend it. The society realised it had made a
mistake, debited Pounds 1,000 and charged the man for the overdraft. He paid
Pounds 260 before complaining to the ombudsmen who ordered the society to
recredit him with Pounds 740 (the part of the original Pounds 1,000 that he
had not repaid) backdated to the time of the original debit.
Insurance: Complaints about insurance more than doubled, mainly as a result
of the fees customers are charged to take out insurance other than a package
offered by a building society. Few cases were taken up because the ombudsmen
had already said it was reasonable for societies to charge a small fee in
return for consenting to particular arrangements.
Home income plans: Edell said there were under 50 complaints in this area
but wanted to highlight the distress of elderly people lured into unsuitable
schemes.
Edell said that home income plans which involved paying off a fixed rate
mortgage with a fixed rate annuity were excellent and virtually risk-free.
However, the danger with schemes with a variable mortgage and unit-linked
bond investing in equities, is that the value of bonds can fall while
interest rates rise leaving people saddled with a mortgage they cannot
afford.
Since these schemes involve equity based investments, they do not fall
completely within the jurisdiction of the building society ombudsmen.
However, Cheltenham &amp; Gloucester, Bradford &amp; Bingley, and Britannia have
agreed to co-operate with the ombudsmen, while Bristol &amp; West and National
Counties have refused. West Bromwich is undecided.

EQUALITY between men and women ought to be a fairly straightforward matter.
But when the UK government unveils its plans to make men and women equals in
pension rights, the solution is likely to leave many unsatisfied.
This week is the closing period for comments on a government paper,
published six months ago, outlining possible ways to ensure equality in
social security benefits paid to men and women. At the heart of the problem
is that, for a number of historical reasons, women have been allowed to
retire at 60 with full State pensions while men have had to wait until 65.
Thus, women receive more pension benefits than men, because their payments
start earlier. The European Court has ruled that this is unfair.
However, since publication of the paper last December, government ministers
have hinted broadly that the so-called 'decade of retirement', which would
allow individuals to retire anywhere between age 60 and 70, is unworkable.
Instead, the government is leaning towards a common retirement age of 63.
This will cost the public purse nothing, but it is still far out of tune
with what is offered by most occupational pension schemes.
Mike Brown, a spokesman for the National Association of Pension Funds, the
industry's trade association, said that the group has just submitted its own
proposals in response to the government's paper, outlining ways to make
flexibility workable and affordable for government.
The NAPF is urging a flexible decade of retirement which could begin at 60,
but those who delayed receipt of their pensions until, say, 65 or 70 could
receive higher monthly payments.
The NAPF is calling for the re-introduction of an earnings rule which would
prohibit those with salaries above a certain level from collecting
government benefit. Thus, the government could ensure that it was not making
payments to those who were still employed and would allow it to devote
resources to those who have genuinely retired.
Pensions experts acknowledge that part of the government's difficulty with
flexibility is the fact that UK benefits are funded on a pay-as-you-go
basis, with younger working people paying for the pensions of their parents.
The government's view is that it would have to assume that if it passed new
laws allowing all men to retire at 60, it would have to raise taxes to cover
the possibility that all would choose to do so.
But Ron Amy, pensions director at Grand Metropolitan and vice-chairman of
the NAPF, argues that this is nonsense. 'The worst case assumption that
everyone wants to retire at 60 must be challenged. People's decisions are
much more likely to be driven by whether they have a job or not.'
Furthermore, Amy said, there is already some flexibility in the state
pension system with women having the choice of retiring between 60 and 65
and men having a similar choice between the ages of 65 and 70. 'Why not just
extend all choices to everyone?' Amy says.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Finance &amp; the Family: The Week Ahead
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
One of the most important results of the week will be announced on Monday
when British Steel reports figures for the year ended March. Investors will
be hoping there is no repetition of the near 20 per cent fall in the share
price immediately after the half-year figures, but the numbers this time are
likely to make grim reading.
City forecasts vary widely but are all negative, from pre-tax losses of
Pounds 75m to Pounds 165m - against profits in 1990/91 of Pounds 254m. The
big question is what happens to the final dividend - the interim was
unchanged at 3p but was accompanied with a veiled warning about the final
pay-out. The total dividend payment in 1990/91 was 8.75p a share.
General Electric Company will disclose on Wednesday in its results for the
year ended March that it is building up a 'cash hillock', a smaller version
of the cash mountain it built in the 1970s. It should have net cash of about
Pounds 600m, with about the same amount tucked away in its joint-ventures
with Siemens, Alcatel Alsthom and General Electric of the US.
Most analysts expect GEC to unveil pre-tax profits of between Pounds 820m
and Pounds 840m against Pounds 818m a year earlier. Kleinwort Benson
forecasts that profits of about Pounds 840m should allow a marginal increase
in the divided to 9.5p from 9.3p last year with earnings per share up to
18.7p from 16p last time.
Lonrho, the international trading conglomerate, is expected to to report a
significant fall in pre-tax profits and a cut in the interim dividend when
it announces results for the six months to March 31. Pre-tax profits are
expected to be between Pounds 25m to Pounds 50m compared with Pounds 109m.
Most analysts expect the dividend to be cut in half, from 5p to 2.5p. Some
believe it may be passed altogether.

THE CITY was expecting Wednesday's annual general meeting of Lloyd's of
London to be tense, chaotic, even violent.
Lloyd's, which reports its results three years in arrears, announced losses
of Pounds 2.06bn in 1989, leaving its Names - the individuals whose assets
provide the market's capital base - facing average losses of Pounds 63,500
per head.
Names on catastrophe reinsurance syndicates, which were overwhelmed by
claims from Hugo, the hurricane that devastated the Caribbean in September
1989, and other natural disasters, bore the brunt and must contend with
bigger average losses. About 4,000 Names on Gooda Walker syndicates suffered
losses of at least Pounds 100,000 per head, for example.
In the event Wednesday's meeting passed off without incident.
The now closed accounts for the 1989 year were described by David Coleridge,
the chairman, as 'one of the darkest chapters' in the insurance market's
300-year history. But how should Names who have avoided the most severe
losses and can afford to trade out of their current difficulties assess the
market's prospects in the future? And should people still consider joining
Lloyd's ?
The traditional advantage of Lloyd's membership - the ability to use capital
twice - still holds good. Names earn returns on their assets from both
investment and underwriting. And in some ways the market is in a better
state today than it was a year ago, when its 1988 losses of Pounds 510m, the
first deficit for 20 years, were announced.
Insurance rates in many sectors are increasing; quite sharply in cases such
as Japanese reinsurance, where competition had driven premiums to very low
levels.
Many of the least efficient syndicates and agencies and the less successful
underwriters have been pushed out of business, as rationalisation proceeds
apace. There are at least 70 fewer syndicates trading in 1992 than last
year.
The result for 1990 will be poor, and a loss of Pounds 1bn is expected when
Lloyd's announces the outcome next year. But 1991 could be better and
Lloyd's should certainly be back in the black - barring a run of
catastrophes - by 1992, when results for this year are reported in 1995.
More important, Lloyd's could soon institute reforms, suggested by the task
force, which completed an extensive review of business practices on the
market in January. These would change the principle of unlimited liability,
by which Names are liable for all losses, down to their smallest
possessions.
For underwriting years starting in January 1993, Names' losses will be
capped at an amount equivalent to 80 per cent of their premium income limits
over four years. Thus, a Name underwriting Pounds 1m (for which he would
need to deposit Pounds 300,000 with Lloyd's) could lose no more than Pounds
800,000 over a four year period. However, this will not help losses for the
underwriting years 1990, 1991, and 1992.
Advisers agree that things have improved. Max Lehrain, of Grimston Scott,
which advises Names on their finances and choice of syndicates, says that
for the right kind of investor it is a good time to join Lloyd's. 'We are at
or near the nadir of the insurance cycle,' he says.
Robert Saunders, of Smith &amp; Williamson, agrees. He says trading conditions
are better than in the late 1980s and people wanting to become Names can
join virtually any syndicate.
Never the less, advisers strike a note of caution. More than 1,000 Names are
seeking compensation for their losses from their agents and, in one case,
from Lloyd's Corporation itself, in a series of legal actions alleging
negligence.
This litigation is bound to affect confidence in the market at a time when
the resources of existing Names are depleted. As many as 4,000 of the 22,300
Names currently trading at Lloyd's could resign at the end of the year,
depressing the size of the market's capital base and increasing the relative
costs of doing business at Lloyd's.
Mike Voller, Lloyd's specialist at accountants BDO Binder Hamlyn, says that
if confidence declines, Lloyd's might shrink and become a much more risky
investment. 'A year ago we might have said it would be a good time to join
but there is so much uncertainty now that we could not recommend it.'
Voller suggests it is better to wait a year to see how the market develops
next year, and perhaps join in 1994.
Most agree that Names must find out more about the business they are in than
they would with more orthodox investments. Many of those worst hit by the
losses of 1989 and 1990 knew very little about their syndicates.
Lehrain offers the following advice to would-be Names.
Be fully aware of the risks
Make sure you have enough money. His own conditions for this are more
stringent than Lloyds itself. 'You should have an annual income of at least
Pounds 100,000 and means of Pounds 250,000 excluding your primary property
or the investments upon which you rely for income. In addition, you should
be able to write out a cheque for Pounds 50,000 with no difficulty.
You do not have to choose the riskiest syndicates just as you would not put
your whole portfolio into Japanese warrants.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Markets: Bush campaign turns heat on Greenspan - Wall Street
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICK HARVERSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WITH THE economic recovery showing signs of cooling off, the heat was turned
up on Federal Reserve chairman Alan Greenspan this week.
President Bush took time off on Wednesday from trading brickbats with Ross
Perot via television and radio talk shows, to launch his clearest call yet
for lower interest rates. In an interview with The New York Times, Bush said
he believed the outlook for inflation was sufficiently unthreatening to
allow room for another cut in interest rates. The implication of his remarks
was clear: Greenspan should worry less about inflation and the bond markets,
and more about the desperately weak nature of the economic recovery.
The President's plea for a policy ease, echoed a day later by Michael
Boskin, his chief economic adviser, was carefully timed. The Fed's key
policy-making Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets next week for its monthly
review of the economy and monetary policy.
The day after the meeting, the June employment report, traditionally the
most closely-watched indicator of economic health, is published. Bush knows
that if anything is going to trigger another rate cut, it is the employment
data. Another rise in the national unemployment rate like the one seen in
May (it jumped from 7.2 per cent to 7.5 per cent), and the pressure for a
policy change may be too intense to ignore.
The President also knows that later in the month the Fed chairman has to
give his bi-annual Humphrey-Hawkins testimony to Congress, where he is bound
to be given a rough ride over his handling of the economy if he has done
nothing by then to stimulate business activity.
Politicians on both sides of the fence in Washington have been united in
their belief recently that the Fed is being too cautious with monetary
policy, and that Greenspan's refusal to cut interest rates one more time (he
last lowered rates in December) could scupper the economy's chances of
making a sustainable, and substantial, recovery from the recession of
1990-1991.
At its last meeting on May 19, the FOMC voted to adopt a neutral stance on
policy. There has been no indication from within the Fed since then to
suggest that view has changed. If anything, recent pronouncements from Fed
governors have confirmed that the policy makers are content with the
economy's progress.
Yet since that May meeting the economic indicators have looked especially
discomforting. This week alone saw bad news on durable goods orders (down
2.4 per cent in May), jobless claims (up 16,000 in the second week of June)
and money supply (all measures down for the middle of the month).
Although the bulk of the decline in durable goods orders was due to a plunge
in defence orders, the most worrying aspect of the data was that factories'
backlog of orders fell for the ninth month in a row, an indication that
consumer demand is not keeping pace with production. If the trend is
maintained, it could have serious implications for output in the second half
of the year.
So what does all this mean for the stock market? One thing is sure: without
an interest rate cut, share prices will not be scaling any new summits in a
hurry.
The 70-point drop in the Dow of a week ago may have cleared the air, and
lured a few buyers back into the market. But if this week's feeble
performance (the Dow moved up and down in the tightest of ranges on light
trading volume) is anything to go by, no one is going to buy this market
until the discount rate, currently at 3.5 per cent, has been cut, preferably
to 3 per cent.
If the feeble state of the economy were not enough to worry about, equity
investors this week had to contend with a possible national rail strike,
which some analysts warned could put the skids under the recovery, and a
Supreme Court ruling that may have opened the door to potentially costly
litigation against the big tobacco companies. That the market took both in
its stride suggests no one is panicking, at least not just yet.
For the moment, the only thing Wall Street can look forward to is perhaps
some quarterly 'window dressing'. Watch out next week for money managers
buying stocks in the hope of making their portfolios, and with it their
performance, look a little bit better for the end of what has been a
difficult second quarter.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Markets: Two tales of high street banking - The Bottom Line
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TSB returned to the black this week with pre-tax profits of Pounds 92m in
the first half of its financial year to April 30.
It was not a particularly sparkling performance but it was a world away from
the misery of TSB's first half results in 1991, when heavy losses at Hill
Samuel, its merchant banking arm, plunged it into a Pounds 150m loss after
making bad debt provisions of Pounds 422m.
The market seems to have seen this improvement coming. After being out of
favour during the second half of last year, TSB has generally outperformed
the market in 1992.
TSB clearly feels that it has things back under control at Hill Samuel and
that its retail banking side is moving along fairly well in spite of the
recession. The worst bad debt problems on its retail operations come from
Mortgage Express, a now defunct subsidiary which lent to the wrong sort of
customer at the height of the housing boom.
Provisions on Mortgage Express were Pounds 37m - and it is by no means
certain that all the bad news is out of the way.
TSB's management is hoping that the years of hard slog are over. A few years
ago, it was a straggly federation of local savings banks with little focus
on its business and much higher operating costs than the rest of the
industry.
That picture has been transformed. TSB has its cost base under control and
has shed nearly 5,000 staff. It knows who its customers are and what it
wants to sell them. In some areas, notably the sale of insurance products
through branches, it is streets ahead of most of its UK competitors.
The trouble is that it is as much affected by the recession as any other
high street bank. The latest results showed that its lending business is
marking time, but that it is chasing high interest deposit customers with
considerable success.
This suggests that its interest income could come under pressure in the
months ahead as it pays out more to its savers without earning more income
from loans. It may be able to offset this by selling other financial
services to those well-to-do customers with their high interest savings
accounts.
Perhaps this is partly why stockbroker analysts still seem to have rather
muted expectations of TSB, even though there are good grounds for thinking
that its troubles are over. But it is also a stock with some bid potential.
TSB's five year period of protection from takeover ended last autumn and
unless it grows in size, it could well attract a predator.
TSB's chequered history contrasts starkly with Abbey National's seemingly
effortless succession of good performances since its stock market flotation
three years ago.
Abbey National is generally seen as a reliable cash generating machine with
a return on capital of more than 17 per cent, even though it is even more
dependent on the housing market than TSB.
Next month Abbey National turns in its half year figures, but there is a
general expectation on the market that they will show a steep rise in loan
loss provisions.
Last year these were Pounds 155m. This summer they could be 50 per cent up
and Abbey National signalled to shareholders in April that profits will be
down at the half year.
That does not necessarily mean that a poor set of results is on the way or
that the medium term outlook is bad. Abbey National has a dividend cover of
two, well ahead of what most other banks are capable of these days.
Abbey National has no merchant bank or corporate lending portfolio to hold
it back and its record on bad debts is likely to remain far better than
those of its competitors among banks and building societies.
Next year should set the seal on its run of successes when its assets
overtake those of its rival of many years, the Halifax Building Society,
making it the undisputed leader of the UK housing finance industry.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Markets: The pricier side of life . . . - Serious Money
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN AUTHERS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ARE YOU suffering from statistical overload? Anyone trying to take a
personal finance decision will soon find out about this distressing
syndrome.
Mountainous league tables exist for every product. The problem is applying
them. They can prove which was the best endowment to buy 25 years ago, or
the best unit trust 10 years ago. But the problem, particularly where
savings are concerned, is the choice, now, between a life product and a
straight investment product. This is trickier.
Most people want the product to perform exactly the same task for them - to
convert their savings over a long period into a big lump sum.
But statisticians face three problems. First, the new breed of unit and
investment trust savings schemes have not been around long. Personal equity
plans (Peps), in which these schemes are most tax-efficient, have existed
for only five years. This makes comparison with life plans, which have
existed for the best part of two centuries, all the harder.
Second, the two products do not set out to do the same thing. Put money into
an endowment and some of it will go towards life insurance, even if you do
not need it. Such cover is important, but it can be bought much more cheaply
and is wholly distinct from investment. Unit and investment trust schemes
also have the virtue of flexibility - you can withdraw money at any time,
and receive the value of your savings, without a penal surrender value.
Third, tax raises its ugly head - collective trusts are liable for capital
gains tax, unless they are held in a Pep, while endowment pay-outs are free
of tax.
Comparison begins to look mighty difficult. But Money Management magazine
has spent the last few months engaged in just this Herculean task. Its
conclusions might still leave you baffled.
The magazine accounts for the life cover as follows. It took the
top-performing ten-year with-profits endowment, from Equitable Life, and
asked how much the expenses of life cover had reduced its yield. The answer
was equivalent to Pounds 1.85 per month from a Pounds 50 premium policy.
It then took the top-performing unit trust over ten years - N&amp;P UK Income -
and calculated how well Pounds 1.85 per month would have fared within this
over ten years. This came to Pounds 581, which was then deducted from their
overall figure for Pounds 50 per month, reducing Pounds 15,735 to Pounds
15,154.
This made Equitable's endowment pay-out of Pounds 13,693 look that much more
competitive. But is this a valid comparison? Life cover as part of an
endowment usually occupies much the same role as the free glasses you pick
up at petrol stations.
For example, the leaflet for Sun Alliance's Cashdate plan devotes more space
to the solar-powered calculator, compact Masterchef and free weekend holiday
which you could win after taking out a plan, than it does to the 'protection
for your family'.
These gifts might be useful to you, in which case the policy might look more
attractive, or they might not, in which case they are irrelevant. The life
cover which comes with an endowment falls into much the same category.
Endowments are sold as investments, and it is fair to judge them solely on
this basis. The Pounds 581 can fairly be reinstated to N&amp;P's pay-out.
But the Money Management figures also show that endowments are very
creditable investment performers over 10 years. The best unit trust schemes
easily beat the best endowments. But the average unit trust scheme has only
made Pounds 10,202, while the average with-profits endowment has made Pounds
11,942, from total premiums paid of Pounds 6,000. Capital gains tax, for
which figures are hard to obtain, would increase the gap.
Over 20 years the trend is reversed and the few unit trusts which have been
going this long have managed to produce an average of Pounds 60,300 before
tax, compared with Pounds 54,274 for endowments - from total premiums of
Pounds 12,000.
So, for less experienced investors, life policies look decent value. Over
relatively short terms, those not confident in their ability to choose a
good unit trust are best sticking with an endowment.
But then comes the next statistical headache - the introduction of Peps.
Calculating results for Pep savings schemes is a nightmare.
But Money Management has produced lump sum figures for 314 unit and 57
investment trust Peps over the last five years. Top performer is Newton
income, which has turned Pounds 1,000 into Pounds 1,956. This would have
been Pounds 1,840 in a non-Pep version, showing that unit trust performance
is considerably enhanced in a Pep.
The problem? Five years is a very unflattering period over which to judge an
equity investment, thanks to the stock market crash of 1987, and 59 unit
trust Peps have actually lost money over five years. Those same market
conditions are also putting with-profits bonuses under threat.
Most sane individuals should now have keeled over with statistical overload.
Perhaps you will have to rely on logic.
Logic shows that with a Pep you will pay less tax, enjoy greater
flexibility, avoid paying for life cover and have the chance of long-term
out-performance. If you are very cautious, the ten-year figures show that
the life offices can still provide good value, in spite of tax burdens
imposed and the need to produce life cover.

FT  27 JUN 92 / A fatal love affair with danger: Richard Cowper traces the
final steps of the climber Wanda Rutkiewicz, who vanished in the 'death
zone' of icy Kangchenjunga
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD COWPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DIVIDING line between heroism and folly, passion and obsession, success
and failure, can be perilously thin. So it was with Wanda Rutkiewicz, a Pole
of striking beauty and power and the greatest woman high-altitude
mountaineer of her time.
She died, aged 49, while driving herself beyond human limits during a final
push to the summit of Kangchenjunga in the border region between Nepal and
Sikkim last month. Her mysterious disappearance in the 'death zone' above
8,300 metres (26,560 ft) on the world's third highest peak seems destined to
transform this controversial personality into a climbing legend.
She was a mountaineer of heroic stature who led the way for women in a man's
domain. In 17 years she made 22 expeditions to the Himalayas, ascending
eight of the world's 14 highest peaks, a feat achieved by just 13 men. She
was the third woman to climb Everest and the first to conquer K2, the
world's second highest mountain.
Yet she could appear a lonely, driven person whose domineering style
alienated some fellow climbers and whose passion to reach the top may have
led her to step beyond the bounds of prudence. Her obsession had already
cost her two husbands. Some were shocked that she carried on climbing after
colleagues had died - but perhaps she had lived close to death for so long
that she had become inured to its horror.
Kangchenjunga is justifiably feared by climbers. The 8,568m mountain calls
for highly technical vertical climbing, requiring ice-axes, crampons, ice
screws and ropes. This spring Wanda launched her third attempt on the peak.
A year earlier her first effort had ended when she discovered the bodies of
two Slovenian climbers at 8,000m. They had reached 8,400m, but had fallen.
She was furious when the Yugoslav leader halted the expedition.
In early March, accompanied by Arek Gasienica, a young Pole, Wanda joined a
Mexican expedition to climb the north ridge route pioneered by Doug Scott,
the British mountaineer, in 1979. The team was led by an experienced
climbing acquaintance, Carlos Carsolio, 28, and included his wife, Elsa, his
brother Alfredo and Andres Delgado, another Mexican.
Their first summit push ended in disarray at Camp IV at 7,950m on April 23
during a storm. Elsa and Alfredo had to be evacuated by helicopter to
Kathmandu, with Elsa facing the amputation of a finger due to frostbite.
Carlos and Wanda decided to make a second attempt. They set off on Thursday
May 7, reaching Camp II On May 10. From there Wanda set off alone at 11am
only to find that Camp III had been destroyed by storms. She spent the
night, at 7,400m, in an ice hole.
Carlos set off at 6pm, climbing through the night, and passed her to arrive
at Camp IV (also an ice cave) 550m higher. He rested during the day and
Wanda arrived at 7pm. They started for the summit together in the dark at
3.30am on Tuesday May 12, but soon split up.
'Snow conditions were bad. Wanda was very slow,' said Carlos. 'We had agreed
to go at our own pace. I reached the summit at 5pm and met her on the way
down at 8pm at around 8,300m, where she was preparing to bivouac in a hole
in the snow, ready to go for the summit next day.'
Wanda, dressed in a down suit, was lying outside her bivouac sack 600m short
of the summit. She had drunk all her water, had no gas, no stove, no food
apart from a few sweets, and no sleeping bag.
Said Carlos: 'I spent about ten minutes with her. She looked cold but seemed
in good spirits. We talked of the technical moves - the two couloirs above
Camp IV and the 20m of crumbling rock just before the top. She was pleased
she had my tracks to follow. She kept looking toward the summit. She was
very excited.'
It was the last time anyone was to see her alive.
'I was thinking maybe I should try to persuade her to come down. But I
didn't. She was very determined. This was her third attempt at
Kangchenjunga. I think she felt she would never get another chance. She knew
what she was doing.'
But did she? To stay alive at that altitude it is essential to drink large
amounts of liquid, but she had no water and no means of melting snow. At her
pace it would have taken her another day to reach the summit. Even Carlos
was so dehydrated and exhausted that he suffered hallucinations on his
descent. First he 'saw' two sherpas from a German expedition who had died
two weeks before. Then he held a conversation with an imaginary Wanda. He
believes now that that marked the moment of her death.
Carlos stayed at Camp IV until midday, then descended and waited for her at
Camp II for three days, leaving her the tent, a sleeping bag, fuel and a
walkie talkie. He left base camp on May 21, eight days after Wanda had
disappeared above 8,300m. No one could have survived at that height for so
long.
How or where she died is a mystery. She may have died of cold or exhaustion.
Possibly she set off in the dark, reached the summit, but fell to her death
on the descent. In spite of her experience and her reputation for careful
climbing, she had made a fatal error of judgment  - all too easy at a height
at which lack of oxygen makes breathing a struggle, every step an
achievement and rational thinking difficult.
Wanda knew that climbers can stay alive for only a limited time above
8,000m. After her historic ascent of K2 in 1986 two of her companions, the
French team of Lillian and Maurice Barrard, perished on the descent after
the three of them had bivouacked at 8,300m without sleeping bags, but in a
tent. Wanda wrote afterwards: 'The weather was still good and I was not
worried. But I should have been. One should remain at that altitude as short
a time as possible. I didn't know in the sunshine that death was following
us down. I didn't see any signals of something wrong.'
Why, six years later, did she fail again to read the signals? Was it the
young climbers' unkind joke at base camp about her being a grandmother -
even though she had no children - which stung her into refusing to descend
with Carlos? Perhaps she finally paid for continuing for too many years with
her addiction.
Some may ask why Carlos did not order her off the mountain, but he was
exhausted and probably not fully aware of her predicament. Even if he had
been, the concept of a mountain leader whose word is law has passed  - and
Wanda was not the type to be ordered around.
Or again, why were they not joined by that 'holy rope' which has physically
and psychologically linked climbers from the earliest days? If they had been
tied together Carlos would never have reached the summit. They would jointly
have been forced to retreat, but both might have survived. However, these
traditional bonds are now widely ignored in Himalayan mountaineering. Above
8,000m, many climb alone. At that height, they say, a partner could not
rescue you without risking death. The image of the inseparable pair, Hilary
and Tensing, striding towards the summit of Everest, is now rare.
For Wanda, however, the obsessive determination which killed her also
produced some of the glories of her career. As a mountaineer, she had no
equal among women and few among men. She climbed in enviable style, often
reaching her summits alone and by difficult routes. In addition to her eight
8,000m-plus peaks she made the first ascent in 1975 with Alison Chadwick, an
English mountaineer, of Gasherbrum III (7,952m) in Pakistan, then the
world's highest unclimbed mountain. She conquered many other demanding
routes, including Messner's route on the north pillar of the Eiger, the
north face of the Matterhorn and the eastern pillar of the Trollriggen in
Norway.
Once on a mountain she led by example, seeing herself as a natural leader,
though others could find her difficult and bossy. One of her best friends
called her the 'Princess'. On Annapurna last October she so annoyed
Krzysztof Wielicki, a renowned Polish mountaineer, that he challenged her
claim to have ascended the mountain just a day after he reached the top -
but Wanda's summit photograph proved that she had.
Her physical strength and determination were legendary. In 1982 she fell off
the face of Mt Elbrus, in the Caucusus, slipping 300m and breaking her leg.
A few months later she led the gruelling two week walk-in to K2 base camp on
crutches and attempted to co-ordinate the summit push from there.
Her two husbands, neither 'professional' climbers, tried to persuade her to
cut down on her trips, but settled for divorce when it became clear that she
would never give up her real love. To some she was distant, vulnerable, and
rather a lonely person, but to others she was charming, and in her late 40s
received invitations from all over the world to join expeditions.
Even in the midst of the disasters that dogged so many of her big climbs she
expressed her passion for high places. Writing of her success on K2, during
a season in which 13 people, including her two climbing partners, died on
the mountain, she said: 'At about 10.15am I reached the summit. It was my
third attempt. I was excited and happy, happy to be alone there, because I
could express my enormous gratitude. I knelt and prayed. I said a big thank
you for the summit, for good weather and for feeling good.'
It was her success on K2 that some suggest gave her a false sense of
invincibility. A few years later she announced she would become the first
woman to complete all 14 8,000 metre peaks, a feat achieved by just two men.
She called it her 'Caravan to Dreams'. Her determination to do this by
spring 1993 led her to attempt two, even three expeditions in a season,
sometimes with people she did not know well. It was then that some came to
fear that her determination might end in death.
One of her few very close friends said: 'She didn't want to die; she didn't
intend to die; but somehow she had nothing against it. She was slowing. Her
soaring mind could no longer correlate with her body.'
Wanda may have had a premonition about death before she disappeared. At
Kangchenjunga base camp she is reported to have said: 'For me to die up
there will not be at all strange. It will be easy. After all, most of my
friends are waiting for me there, in the mountains.'

ONE DAY soon you may get a shock when you find you cannot renew your
insurance at any price. It has happened to a lot of people already, though
maybe not down your street.
This week, uncharacteristically, the dull business of insurance has been
making headlines. Lloyd's of London duly declared its much-leaked loss of
just over Pounds 2bn for the 1989 three-year account. Not to be outdone, the
companies which make up the membership of the Association of British
Insurers declared an aggregate 1991 trading loss of Pounds 3.3bn on general
insurance; in the UK last year insurance companies paid out Pounds 1.30 in
claims and expenses for every Pounds 1 of premiums.
As a reflex action, insurance men argue that premiums must rise. Yet it does
not appear that slow premium growth is really the problem, for premiums
climbed by 18 per cent in the UK last year.
The other solution to the problem is that claims should fall. Indeed they
should, say the insurers, and they present the problem in terms of fraud,
which will be highlighted in a forthcoming advertising campaign. That
conveniently, they hope, shifts the blame on to the policyholders rather
than the insurers. But it seems to me that the role of insurance must be
more fundamentally questioned.
We come here to the problem of moral hazard. This is not just a question of
the dodgy repairman's 'insurance job' on to which all kinds of extras are
loaded, or the attitude of the Scottish freezer-owner - unkindly singled out
by the ABI - who claimed for 93lb of ruined food when the freezer in
question would only hold 45lb.
The influence of insurance is more pervasive. Insured assets are less
carefully looked after. Consumers have filled up their homes with goods and
bought expensive cars on the basis that the risks of theft or fire could be
covered. Parking a car is a little like leaving Pounds 10,000 in cash in the
gutter, protected only by a flimsy lock. Businesses have sunk billions into
often unguarded premises. It has amounted to a huge investment in the raw
material for crime, which indeed has become a growth industry: the BIA says
that domestic crime claims were up 75 per cent in 1991.
Insurers weep crocodile tears at the growth of claims, but the truth is that
in normal circumstances bigger claims lead to a bigger insurance industry -
unless, of course, the claims start getting out of hand. Even worse than
fraudsters, from this point of view, are predatory US lawyers who have
driven up legal settlements beyond the imagination of Lloyd's underwriters.
But then, the insurance industry has never appeared to have a very sure
management touch. I have always wondered at how badly the big listed
composite companies have performed in stock market terms. The composite
insurance sector index has badly underperformed the All-Share Index in the
30 years it has been calculated - only one or two dead-beat sectors like
engineering and motors have done worse over that timespan. And insurance,
remember, is actually a growth business.
Now the insurance industry is trying to impose its own corporate governance
system, featuring apparently out-of-touch chairmen and large numbers of
ineffective non-executive directors, on the rest of British industry. But
the British insurance companies which used to to be world leaders are now
retrenching and struggling; as for Lloyd's, the Continental reinsurance
groups will surely prosper as Lime Street's capacity is savagely cut back.
An important factor in the poor showing of the composites is that the
industry has simply not been able to handle the shift from a cartelised
structure with a rates 'tariff' to a competitive system. Return on capital
has taken a back seat as managers have chased market share. Insurance
companies have hoarded and then squandered shareholders' capital which could
not be profitably invested in the business.
Competition has had another important effect. Whereas with the cartel
cross-subsidy was rife there has subsequently been a chase after good risks
and an ever-increasing segmentation of the market. It has reached the point
where bad risks are being priced out of the market, or perhaps turned away
point blank. If this simply applies to flashy sports cars perhaps little
harm will be done, except to Porsche or Lotus. But in other cases there
could be dangerous social implications. What happens if an old-age pensioner
in an inner city area cannot obtain household cover? And if the government
decides that people should be entitled to drive a car at the age of 17, is
it right that the insurance companies should, through penal loading,
effectively impose an age limit of 25 instead?
If insurance becomes too expensive you have to change your lifestyle. In the
South of France big houses are surrounded by barbed wire and vicious dogs.
Drivers in Italy are forced to remove their car hi-fi units and carry them
around after they have parked. Those American lawyers may have done a
splendid job for their existing clients, and are no doubt now licking their
lips at the prospect of tobacco company suits, but future victims may find
themselves uncovered. Indeed, in some of these corporate liability cases
insurance is almost becoming counterproductive, because lawyers go most
eagerly after the parties that they know have cover.
Perhaps the US is demonstrating the reductio ad absurdum of the insurance
concept. Insurance companies - and poor old Lloyd's Names - have funded the
huge escalation of claims and court awards. It is not yet as bad in the UK.
But insurance companies have got to abandon the idea that they can simply
keep jacking up premiums and they must refine their ideas about what
constitutes an insurable risk.
We may have to learn not to tuck quite so many frozen TV dinners away in the
freezer.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The stock market yesterday rightly took Thursday's surprise ruling on Sunday
trading in its stride. For one thing only a small number of councils are
sufficiently motivated or well organised to obtain the necessary
injunctions.
More to the point, the decision of the law lords to make the government
rather than local authorities responsible for compensating stores if the
1950 Shops Act proves to be incompatible with EC law puts new pressure on
ministers to rush through their own legislation. The European Court is
probably astute enough to fudge its verdict - but the Treasury will hardly
want to count on it.
That raises the question of whether Sunday trading for all means extra
profit for the retailers. The simple answer is that those currently opening
seven days a week would hardly be doing so if they did not see an advantage.
With many of their competitors closed while the legal situation remains
unclear, however, the incentive is mainly to grab market share. On the
demand side the argument hinges largely on whether retail sales will
ultimately command a bigger slice of consumer spending, with more money
spent in, say, Sainsbury than the local pub. There is little evidence of any
significant shift to date.
On the cost side you can look at it two ways: higher wages on the one hand
but fixed rents and rates and reduced waste for supermarkets working through
the weekend on the other. The most realistic approach, though, is to view
Sunday trading as merely increasing the UK's retailing capacity. That is
something the industry needs like a hole in the balance sheet.

FT  27 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Olivetti/DEC
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The fact that Olivetti has signed a strategic accord with Digital Equipment
Corporation comes as no great surprise. What is puzzling, though, is why the
US company should be prepared to pay more than two and a half times the
market price - and more than net asset value - for an 8 per cent stake in
its Italian partner.
One can only assume DEC knows what it is doing, though some may suspect a
touch of desperation about the move. The mini-computer maker has poured
millions into the development of its Alpha microprocessor technology, but is
up against stiff competition in the so called Risc market from the likes of
IBM, Hewlett-Packard and Sun Microsystems. Olivetti offers access to
customers in the UK and Germany, as well as Italy, plus the prospect of
other product relationships which have yet to be announced. Unlike DEC it
has also concentrated on the open systems thought by most industry analysts
to be the way of the computer industry's future.
Yesterday's deal carries an irony for Olivetti's chairman Mr Carlo De
Benedetti, who was at pains to assure shareholders that alliances and
independence are not mutually contradictory. It was Mr De Benedetti, after
all, who initially adopted a friendly approach in Brussels before launching
his fierce, but ultimately unsuccessful, takeover assault on Societe
Generale de Belgique in 1988. DEC appears to have no aggressive intent, but
even allowing for the generous price placed on his shares the Olivetti
chairman must feel as though he is now firmly on the back foot.

Talk of BP's possible dividend cut could scarcely have come at a worse time
for UK equities. The market is already bracing itself for British Steel's
cut to be announced on Monday. That may set other companies on the same
track, especially struggling ones in the financial sector or in capital
goods where the average dividend is already only just covered. Some of the
latter based their generosity in respect of 1991 on confidence in the
future, but with the prospect of a vigorous upswing ever more remote that
argument now rings hollow.
Perhaps the surprise in the response to BP was that the Footsie fell only 23
points yesterday. But, then, the index was already some 180 points below its
post-election high when the news struck on Thursday night. Some lowered
expectations for both dividends and earnings must already be discounted, and
on a longer-term perspective the market may now be cheap. It would not do to
assume that the slide has bottomed out, though. There may still be a case
for switching into defensive stocks like utilities. For the market as a
whole there are precious few short-run grounds to buy.

FT  27 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Crude estimates at BP
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
BP shares settled comfortably yesterday at around 210p after their initial
14 per cent fall on Mr Robert Horton's resignation as chairman. That
stability could be deceptive. It represents little more than the balance of
widely varying guesses about the company's true dividend intentions. And
these will only be known when it reveals its half-year results in early
August.
BP might by then have decided on a radical course, and cut the dividend in
half. If so, the shares would need to fall further, perhaps to around 180p,
to produce an acceptable yield premium over Shell. Since cash is flowing out
of the company at a rate of maybe Pounds 1.5bn a year, the case for a savage
dividend cut is strong. Further risks for the share price include the
possibility that BP will at some stage launch a rights issue to help reduce
its 85 per cent gearing, and that US investors, who by all accounts were
great admirers of the Horton style, will take fright and sell.
BP has not, however, cut its dividend since the first world war. Even for Mr
David Simon, the new chief executive, any decision will be highly charged.
It is difficult to imagine him getting away without any cut at all. But the
prospect that cash will be less tight next year as capital spending falls
may point towards a compromise approach. BP would currently yield an
attractive 7 per cent if its dividend were cut by only one third.
This may help explain the market's present reluctance to see the shares fall
much further. There cannot be much bid premium. BP would still be an
expensive morsel for the likes of Hanson, and many of its most disposable
assets have already gone. Holders can still console themselves with a more
prosaic consideration. On a two-year earnings horizon, the shares now offer
value compared with Shell whatever their relative yield.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Recession could cut the cost of dying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TIM BURT
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DYING could become cheaper, according to the director of Britain's first
management course for undertakers.
The recession looks set to spark intense competition among funeral
companies. Cut-price burials and service discounts could soon be offered.
And it is not just economic hard times that have hit the funeral business.
The trend among customers towards greater life expectancy has not helped.
Although steady demand has kept most funeral companies in profit during the
recession, some are now looking at value-for-money options to increase
market share.
Mr Stuart West - who runs the course at the International Co-operative
College at Loughborough, Leicestershire, where more than 30 undertakers
graduated yesterday - says companies can only expand by taking market share
from competitors.
'To get market share you have to get price benefits to the customers,' he
said. 'So funerals are likely to get cheaper.'
Companies may also be forced to drop voluntary restrictions on advertising
and diversify into financial services for the bereaved as they compete for
business.
Large companies, such as Great Southern and the French-owned Plantsbrook
group, already offer pre-paid funerals, and others are understood to be
considering investment portfolio schemes and estate management.
Price cuts would be welcomed by consumer groups which this year complained
that funeral costs had increased by more than 50 per cent since 1985.
The average cost of a basic funeral is about Pounds 600, although extras
such as an oak coffin can push the price above Pounds 1,000.

FT  27 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei at lowest level
since May 1986
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ARBITRAGE selling once again depressed share prices, and the Nikkei average
fell to the lowest level since May 1986, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The index closed down 330.99 at 15,812.73, 4.3 per cent lower on the week,
having risen to the day's high of 16,227.22 in the morning on
bargain-hunting, and fallen to a low of 15,759.74 in the afternoon.
Volume remained low at 240m shares, down marginally from 249m. Declines led
advances by 660 to 274, with 178 unchanged. The Topix index of all first
section stocks fell 17.05 to 1,231.45 and, in London, the ISE/Nikkei 50
index fell 6.05 to 963.44.
Traders blamed yesterday's weakness on a decline in blue chip electrical
stocks, which were sold on concerns about the higher yen. The dollar fell
Y1.20 against the yen to Y125.60, closing below Y126 for the first time in
four months.
Issues which had gained on Thursday lost ground on profit-taking. Hitachi
fell Y24 to Y741 and Toshiba by Y2 to Y631.
Companies affected by sharp falls in asset values were heavily sold. Banks,
constructions, and brokerages were among the largest losers of the day.
Analysts said that this reflected uncertainty stemming from a lack of
information. 'Market participants are going to assume the worst if they
don't know the full extent of the problems,' said Mr Bernard Siman, analyst
at Jardine Fleming.
Banks, whose bad loans are thought to amount to Y56,000bn, have failed to
disclose the real figures. Leading trust banks, known for their extensive
lending to real estate and stock speculators, are seen to be under severe
pressure. Mitsui Trust and Banking fell Y31 to a year's low of Y599, and
Mitsubishi Trust and Banking lost Y32 to Y735.
Misawa Homes, which held a press conference on Thursday following the sharp
fall in its share price on rumours of financial problems, fell Y69 to Y871.
Investors were not convinced by the company's denials, and were disturbed by
Misawa's announcement of a 95 per cent fall in consolidated after-tax
profits.
Daikyo, which plunged last week on rumours of cash flow problems, also fell
Y25 to Y705.
In Osaka, the OSE average fell 199.59 to 18,737.53 in volume of 12.1m
shares.
Roundup
EXCITEMENTS abroad sustained Hong Kong, and brought new life to Manila
yesterday as Taiwan stayed weak.
HONG KONG closed at a record high but profit-taking in late trade dragged
the Hang Seng index down from its intra-day peak of 6,178.96, reflecting
London buying on Thursday, to close 34.41 higher at 6,111.10, 5.6 per cent
higher on the week.
Turnover stayed heavy at HKDollars 4.72bn against Thursday's HKDollars
4.89bn. HSBC, which won control of Midland Bank on Thursday, topped the
active list and rose 75 cents to HKDollars 48, unchanged from its close in
London.
MANILA rose 3.2 per cent on the day, but just 2.1 per cent better on a week
bedevilled by fluctuations in Philippine Long Distance Telephone (PLDT).
The composite index closed 47.41 higher at 1,525.31. PLDT's rise of 35 to
1,030 pesos encouraged bargain-hunting elsewhere.
TAIWAN fell across the board as small investors followed their bigger
brethren in dumping stocks, particularly financials.
The weighted index, down more than 110 points just before the close, ended
63.04 or 1.4 per cent lower at 4,501.97, 1.9 per cent down on the week.
Turnover was active at TDollars 36.2bn, up from TDollars 35.6bn.
SEOUL edged higher in a technical reaction to Thursday's decline to a
52-month low. The composite index climbed 3.79 to 552.09, down 3.3 per cent
on the week.
BOMBAY traded in only a few shares as brokers resumed their boycott. The BSE
index shed 0.78 to 3,080.54.

FT  27 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): German carmakers fall on lower
domestic registrations
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES closed the week on an easier trend, writes Our Markets Staff.
FRANKFURT lost faith in carmakers following lower-than-expected domestic car
registrations. BMW dropped DM12.50 to DM595 and Volkswagen by DM12.20 to
DM386.
Turnover was flat at DM5.2bn as the FAZ and DAX indices dropped 5.22 to
695.83, and 10.76 to 1,754.13 for falls on the week of 1.4, and 1.1 per cent
respectively.
Other blue chip fallers included Viag, down DM7.50 to DM397.20 in a delayed
reaction to Thursday's disappointing progress report from its packaging
subsidiary, Schmalbach-Lubeca, and Mannesmann, which denied rights issue
rumours but still fell DM9 to DM298.50.
PARIS retreated after Thursday's gains, as Generale des Eaux generated about
one-quarter of the day's business. The CAC 40 index fell 5.03 to 1,915.31,
little changed on the week, in turnover of FFr2.8bn.
Generale des Eaux closed down FFr23 at FFr2,176 in heavy volume of 312,980
shares in arbitrage-related trading ahead of the expiry of warrants next
week.
Societe Generale fell FFr14.60 to FFr495.40 after Moody's, the US credit
rating agency, placed its long-term deposits and long-term debt under review
for possible downgrading.
Total rose 30 centimes to FFr232.8 on news that the government's sale of a
stake in the oil company was oversubscribed.
MILAN closed at another 1992 low as the long wait for a new government
continued. The Comit index fell 4.09 to 462.12, down 1.7 per cent on the
week, in turnover estimated at near Thursday's L78.9bn.
Shares in the Olivetti and De Benedetti holding companies, Cir and Cofide,
were suspended at the start of trading. Olivetti said that Digital Equipment
was paying L8,500 per share for 4.03 per cent in Olivetti and that Digital's
stake would eventually reach 10 per cent.
After the close, Moody's said it had cut the senior debt rating of San Paolo
di Torino and Crediop.
AMSTERDAM was depressed by a lower dollar as the CBS Tendency index fell 0.8
to 123.9, down 2.1 per cent on the week.
The ousting of Mr Robert Horton as BP chairman brought Royal Dutch into
closer focus since it, too, has maintained dividend payments throughout a
tough period of low oil prices. Royal Dutch lost Fl 1.30 to Fl 151.60.
ZURICH heard bad news from the market, where the SMI index fell 10.3 to
1,835.5, 1.8 per cent lower on the week, but good news from the watchmaker,
SMH, which said that its profits had risen by 300 per cent in the first five
months of this year and saw its shares up SFr80 to SFr1,250.
OSLO, down for the 14th consecutive session a week ago, was still not sure
it had touched bottom yesterday with the all-share index 5.73 lower at
404.76 for a drop on the week of 2.5 per cent.

FT  27 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Saying goodbye to the 1987 stock market
crash - Adrian FitzGerald suggests that fund managers should be able to peep
out from behind their parapets
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ADRIAN FITZGERALD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
There will be gleeful rubbing of hands at the end of 1992, whatever happens
over the next six months. Why? Because the effects of the 1987 stockmarket
crash will fall out of most long-term performance statistics.
Few will forget the euphoria of the pre-crash 1980s. By mid-1987, UK fund
managers could boast proudly of long-term returns from their equity
portfolios of almost 35 per cent on an annualised basis. Fund managers
heavily invested in Japan could point to a sustained performance in that
market averaging over 55 per cent a year. Anyone sitting with money in the
bank was on to a loser. Or so it seemed.
Performance statistics have looked very different over the five years since
then. Cash has been the winning UK asset over the last five years,
outperforming both gilts and equities. Sterling returns from overseas equity
markets have been almost precisely zero. And anyone looking for a dinner
party ice-breaker might like to note the interesting fact that UK bank
deposits have outperformed Japanese equities by 250 per cent since the
mid-year point five years ago]
Yes, the real grief has been experienced in Japan. That market has fallen 60
per cent from its high point in December 1989 to its recent low. Those
investors heavily exposed to Japan and who are now desperately searching for
indications of cheapness will find little consolation in the fact that the
market still yields only 1 per cent. Nor will they feel comforted by the
realisation that the market has to climb by 150 per cent simply to get back
to where it was. The mathematics of investment is always fascinating, but it
can also be very cruel.
Another mathematical consequence of the Japanese market's dramatic decline
is that its capitalisation is now less than that of the combined European
markets. Europe comprises almost 28 per cent of the FT-A World Indices
compared with a figure of just under 24 per cent for Japan. Japan has had
the larger capitalisation for the last nine years. The US market weighting
relative to that of Japan also shows a substantial increase. It is almost 17
percentage points higher after being more than 10 percentage points lower
just two and a half years ago.
Certainly, any of the funds rumoured to have moved money into Japan in the
latter part of 1991 will not have enjoyed the last six months. But the
typical UK-based pension fund has nothing like the same exposure as the FT-A
World benchmark. WM Company figures suggest that approximately 6 per cent of
total equity exposure is to Japan, with a further 7 per cent invested in the
US. Approximately 11 per cent is invested in Continental Europe.
Given this distribution, most pension fund managers should record at least
some modest progress during the first half of 1992. UK equities - by far
their biggest asset class - notched up a new peak in May and have produced
an overall return of 6 per cent. Sterling returns from Japan, the US and
Continental Europe have been minus 28 per cent, minus 2 per cent and 5 per
cent respectively.
And what a difference it would make to those five year performance figures
if equity markets were to regain some upward momentum over the next six
months. The second half of 1987 will drop out of the reckoning, to be
replaced by the second half of 1992; the long-term returns from at least
some equity markets may start to show a modicum of respectability; and fund
managers should at last be able to peep out from behind their parapets.
This is not to suggest that major mishaps can be entirely ruled out for the
rest of the year. Indeed, financial markets are going to have a lot to
contend with, particularly as the world economy is showing only a faint
inclination to stagger to its feet. Some hopeful signs are starting to
emerge in the US, but the economic news coming out of Japan is still
depressing. The same is true in the UK, where any economic growth at all
this year would come as a pleasant surprise.
The result of the recent Danish referendum has also added to uncertainty and
places a large question mark over successful, united progress in Europe. The
Irish equivalent has raised some hopes that all is not lost; however, there
can be little doubt that European markets will continue to feel the effects
of the current impasse.
But it is Wall Street which could prove to be the most vulnerable during the
second half of the year. Signs of economic recovery and a pick-up in
corporate borrowing suggest that we are close to the bottom of the interest
rate cycle. Rates are likely to start trending upwards later in the year. On
top of this are the increasing political risks, including the possibility
that a determined Ross Perot could well cause more than a few upsets come
November. The only certainty is that investors in the US market are in for a
bumpy ride in the second half.
It would be wrong nevertheless to paint too bearish a picture. One lesson
the stockmarket crash of 1987 should have taught us all is that it is
optimism and euphoria that we should really be wary of, and there is
precious little of either about at present. Indeed, the level of gloom is
such that contrarian investors can only be scenting buying opportunities.
And long-term investors know that very little has to be achieved for their
performance figures to become so much better by the year end.
Farewell, then, the stockmarket crash of 1987.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture (Week in the Markets): Copper
advance gathers pace
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD MOONEY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE RECENT upturn in copper prices gathered pace this week as concern
deepened about the availability of supplies. The London Metal Exchange cash
price closed yesterday near a 7 1/2 -month high at Pounds 1,252.50 a tonne,
up Pounds 10 on the week. But the full extent of the advance was obscured by
a rise in sterling's value against the US dollar. If the currency factor is
allowed for cash copper's true rise on the week works out at Pounds 31.50 a
tonne. In dollar terms the price this week reached its highest level for
more than a year.
The price rise is being encouraged at present by worries over slow progress
in labour contract talks at Asarco of the US, which produces about 450,000
tonnes of copper a year, labour tensions in the Polish copper industry, and
troublesome weather in Chilean mining areas.
The longer term supply outlook also appears more bullish. Mr William Adams
of London broker Rudolf Wolff said this week that a world copper supply
deficit of about 100,000 tonnes was now expected for 1992, instead of the
50,000-tonne surplus being predicted at the beginning of the year.
The market for copper and other metals was receiving little encouragement
from the supply side, however, according to Mr David Humphries, an economist
at the RTZ Corporation. He said metal demand was falling in Japan, which
accounted for 18 per cent of world usage, while prospects were dim in the
EC, accounting for 30 per cent, because Germany was 'coming off the boil'.
Only in the US, which accounts for a quarter of world usage, was metal
demand showing signs of recovery.
That situation would appear to bode ill for the zinc market, especially as
the metal is in heavy oversupply - a 2,750-tonnes rise in LME warehouse
stocks this week took the total to a record 327,550 tonnes, up from 156,800
tonnes at the beginning of the year. But a long-running, options-related
supply squeeze is continuing to underpin the market, in spite of the LME's
recent action to take some heat out of the situation.
In the two week's since the exchange announced the imposition of a
descending ceiling on the daily premium during the June/July period (the
immediate focus of the squeeze) the cash premium over three months metal has
fallen from Dollars 189 to Dollars 57.50 a tonne. For most of that time the
cash and three months prices themselves were also falling and traders were
saying that the fundamental supply/demand situation was beginning to be
reflected. But this week saw that price trend reversed. By last night's
close the cash position was quoted at Dollars 1,356 a tonne, up Dollars 55
on the week and Dollars 66 off Tuesday's low, while the three months price
was Dollars 1,298.50 a tonne, up Dollars 101 on the week and Dollars 100.50
off Monday's low.
'There has been so much technical activity in the zinc market I'm reluctant
to say whether any price movement is evidence of anything at all,' was Mr
Humphries' comment.
Tin traders are faced with no such problems of interpretation. Supplies of
good quality tin are tight, overall world stocks are at a manageble level
and mine output is falling. As a result the market has moved steadily
upwards in recent weeks.
Tuesday saw something of a shake-out but support quickly appeared and by
yesterday's close cash tin was trading at Dollars 6,950 a tonne, having
added Dollars 192.50 to last week's Dollars 297.50 rise.
Although coffee traders at the London Futures and Options Exchange were
holding out little hope of significant progress being made towards a price
stabilising International Coffee Agreement at this week's London talks, they
were reluctant to sell while there was the slightest chance of a positive
outcome. But that reluctance appeared to evaporate as the talks approached
last night's scheduled conclusion with nothing having happened to contradict
the traders' pessimism. The September robustas futures contract ended the
day Dollars 23 lower at Dollars 686 a tonne, down Dollars 20 on the week.
In the cocoa market, meanwhile, the expectation of further selling by the
debt-ridden Ivory Coast and Ghana was enough to push prices to a succession
of fresh 16 1/2 year lows until the September position reached Pounds 509 a
tonne on Thursday. The price recovered to end the week at Pounds 535 a
tonne, up Pounds 1 on balance, but traders were not ready to suggest that
that the bear trend might be over. Bargain hunting was a more likely
explanation for the late rally, they said.

FT  27 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Heavy setback in BP
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, PETER JOHN and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE COLLAPSE of British Petroleum (BP) shares following Thursday evening's
stunning resignation of Mr Robert Horton, chairman and chief executive, came
as no surprise to marketmakers in London after a slide in the US overnight.
The price opened at 205p, compared with the previous day's close of 243p,
and shaded to 204p in a frantic trading session before stabilising and
closing a net 34 down at 209p. Some determined buying of the shares was
believed to reflect large scale support from a number of institutions from
the UK, but not from the US, according to dealers. Turnover was a massive
110m shares.
Many analysts continued to take the view that the company would cut the
quarterly dividend when it announces its second quarter results in late or
early August. But there was debate as to the size of any reduction, with one
leading broking house suggesting that the dividend is likely to be
maintained.
The oil team at County NatWest said Mr Horton's resignation was 'not a
specific signal that the dividend will be cut' but cautioned that with BP
'overgeared and overdistributing, ultimately a rights issue and/or a
dividend cut will be needed.' Worries about the need for a rights issue have
long been circulating in the market.
It was also said that any cut in BP's dividend would be very badly received
in the US. American investors have been big buyers of BP in recent months
and are now thought to hold getting on for 10 per cent of the equity, or
around 500m shares. One sector analyst commented that 'If BP cut the payment
then a lot of those shares will be on their way back across the Atlantic in
double quick time.' BP director Mr Steve Ahearne, is scheduled to address a
meeting of the Society of Investment Analysts in London on Tuesday.
Wellcome hit
Pharmaceuticals group Wellcome hit its lowest level this year as dealers
focused on reports that US scientists had made an important discovery in the
development of an AIDS drug which would compete with Wellcome's Retrovir.
Scientists at Yale University claim a drug called Nevirapine has fewer side
effects than Retrovir, which represents a fairly small proportion of
Wellcome's turnover but has a high profile because of AIDS. Wellcome said it
foresaw no threat to its drug from the findings.
The shares were down 37 at one stage and closed 27 off at 887p as brokers
involved in the forthcoming share flotation began their global road show of
presentations yesterday. Some traders fear weak stock market conditions
could force Wellcome Trust to cut the price of its Pounds 3bn international
share offer.
The shares also responded to a weak dollar and speculation that County
NatWest, the only significant UK broker not involved in the flotation, had
turned negative. However, County said it had been a holder of Wellcome since
November and had not changed its stance.
The rest of the pharmaceuticals sector came under pressure in the wake of
Wellcome's slide. Fisons fell 18 to 195p, with US house Salomon Brothers
said to offering stock, Glaxo shed 14 to 693p and SmithKline Beecham eased 6
to 873p.
Trouble continued to dog British Aerospace (BAe), as its broker Hoare Govett
downgraded the group, although the house remains a buyer of the stock. Hoare
refused to detail its revised figures, but talk in the market suggested that
it had halved its pre-tax forecast to some Pounds 75m, before any
provisions.
One factor in the Hoare calculations was uncertainty surrounding the future
of BAe's regional aircraft business. Mr Nick Cunningham at Strauss Turnbull
commented: 'BAe remains a buy for the brave. It is difficult to put any
figures to the group until it can provide some solid information. Until
then, the inevitable uncertainty will be reflected in the share price.' BAe
shares dipped 10 to 262p.
Shell was a big beneficiary of the BP weakness, with the shares moving up 4
to 502p on turnover of 4.6m. There was hectic trading in Lasmo which settled
a fraction higher at 177p on heavy turnover of 13m shares after the
ultimately successful outcome of the public offering of the downstream
interests acquired when it took over Ultramar.
A broker downgrade upset Barclays shares which dropped sharply to close 12
off at 339p on turnover of 3.9m.
Sedgwick was a big casualty in the insurance area of the market as an
institutional seller of a block of 5.9m shares at 174p, well below the
ruling market price, saw the stock retreat to close a net 8 off at 181p.
Turnover totalled 14m shares. Willis Corroon fell in sympathy, closing 12
lower at 220p.
The market's anxiety over the possibility of a cut in BP's dividend prompted
a wave of support for utilities where dividends are seen as safe and above
average.
Regional electricity stocks attracted strong support with Northern 10 higher
at 344p, while Eastern rose 7 to 280p and Manweb 6 to 365p.
Kleinwort Benson was said to have been a big supporter of the water sector.
Severn Trent was the pick of the water stocks, the shares improving 8 to
402p. Anglian edged up 5 to 412p, as did Thames to 429p.
A trade press report that Rolls-Royce may be interested in Allison, the
General Motors' gas turbine subsidiary, was poorly received in the market.
The shares lost 2 to 153p as wary traders eyed the suggested Dollars 750m
price tag with caution, arguing that Rolls would need to issue paper to make
such an offer.
Boardroom changes shook BM Group, the shares plunging 81 to 233p in heavy
turnover of 4.2m.
Poor German car registration figures for May knocked GKN, which tumbled 17
to 369p in exceptional turnover of 3.7m.
Reuters continued to respond to the launch this week of Globex, the
international after-hours screen trading system. The shares were up 6
against the market at 1136p.
Motor and financial services group Inchcape slipped 17 to 463p on talk of a
stock overhang and some profit-taking after recent strength.
One dealer said a line of 2m shares had been overhanging the market.
Kleinwort Benson analyst Mr Bob Carpenter said the motor distribution market
has been difficult in the first half of the year and a weaker US dollar had
an adverse impact on sentiment.
Specialist chemicals company BTP fell 10 to 228p following disappointing
annual results this week. Hoare Govett has cut its forecast for the year
ending March 1993 by Pounds 4m to Pounds 22m.
International drinks groups were hit by downgradings from Smith New Court.
Allied-Lyons slipped 3 to 632p, with Grand Metropolitan losing 6 at 457p,
and Guinness falling 14 to 545p. Mr Mike McCarthy, analyst at Smith New
Court, said the forecasts had been cut for all three against a background of
falling spirit sales in Britain and the US and possible exchange rate
losses, because of a weaker dollar against sterling.

FT  27 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Equity futures and options trading
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE FURORE surrounding British Petroleum helped produce a healthy trade in
stock options and contributed to a lively session in stock index futures
yesterday, writes Christopher Price.
Concerns over BP saw the September FT-SE contract open down at 2,570, which
turned out to be the low point of the day as traders went on a buying spree,
spurred on by sentiment that recent gloomy talk - BP notwithstanding - was
somewhat overdone. By 10am, September had rallied up to 2,593, its high
point.
It then drifted off as trading quietened down towards mid-day, although it
continued to command an average 10-point premium over fair value. Support
was forthcoming from the gilts and bond markets, although short sterling was
reported dull for most of the day.
In the afternoon, September continued to drift, eventually closing at 2,578,
down 25 on the previous session and at a 9-point premium to its estimated
fair value of 35. Turnover was a perky 8,877.
BP dominated traded stock options with 9,982 contracts being dealt. The
October 200 series was particularly busy. Total volume was nearly 35,000,
slightly down from Thursday. The FT-SE 100 traded 10,168 contracts, with BAT
popular at 1,548 contracts and Lasmo at 1,377.

FT  27 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Leading equities trim early losses
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE DRAMATIC developments overnight at British Petroleum faced an immediate
and brutal reckoning on the London stock market yesterday. Nearly Pounds
1.9bn was wiped off the market capitalisation of BP as institutional
investors shied away from the danger that one of Britain's largest companies
might cut its dividend payout, and many leading shares fell heavily as
analysts spotlighted other companies where the dividend could be at risk.
But the initial setback across the stock market was trimmed later, and the
day's loss on the FT-SE Index was held to under 24 points. Government bonds
gained half a point in good trading, with Index-linked issues standing out
well.
'The BP story is not over yet,' was the general view in London. A statement
from the BP board on dividend prospects is regarded as inevitable next week,
perhaps at a meeting with UK analysts which was arranged some time ago.
Particularly worrying is the outlook for BP shares in New York, where US
investors are likely to be highly sensitive to the perceived threat to the
dividend.
However, the reaction across the broad range of the market was better than
feared. After plunging by 32 points in early trading and failing to hold a
rally at mid-session, the FT-SE Index ended the session 23.2 down at
2,534.1. The stock market was helped by a strong performance from the
futures sector where the September contract on the FT-SE Index held a good
premium.
About 11 points of the fall represented the drop of 34p in BP and the Index
was also hit by hefty setbacks in a handful of other Footsie constituents.
Wellcome tumbled as the prospects for next week's share sale were clouded by
the new threat to the market. And the search for dividend-sensitive stocks
brought losses for, among others, Fisons, Barclays Bank and British Steel.
At last night's close, the Footsie Index showed a loss of 27.5 points over
the week and of 46.4 points or 1.8 per cent over the two week trading
account. The setback has reflected concern over weakness in the Tokyo
market, which again provided a nervous backcloth for London yesterday
morning, and also over sluggishness in the UK economy. But many analysts
argue that the UK equity market offers good value at current levels.
Seaq volume, boosted by heavy trade in BP, rose to 637.5m shares yesterday.
After initial uncertainty, customer business in equities has risen sharply
this week as the institutions have reshaped portfolios in a falling market.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Dollar still weak
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE on the dollar eased a little in European trading yesterday morning
but the US currency slipped back towards the close as the early support
evaporated.
'It took nearly all day for the dollar to get to DM1.5460 but only minutes
for the bears to trash it,' said one trader.
The US currency opened at DM1.5400 after recovering from DM1.5370 in New
York, but closed at DM1.5390. Traders said the outlook for the US currency
remained grim. Thursday's run of bad economic data - a big jump in weekly
jobless claims and slow M2 growth - continued to fan speculation of a
further rate cut.
'The dollar doesn't seem to have any desire to recover at the moment,' said
one trader.
'You would have to be very clever to buy the dollar and make any money out
of it.'
Yesterday's US data elicited little reaction on the foreign exchanges.
Personal income last month rose 0.3 per cent on the previous month while
spending rose by 0.5 per cent. Economists had expected a 0.4 per cent rise
in both categories.
The dollar remained steady against the yen, This was partly due to heavy
selling of the Japanese currency for D-Marks and Swiss francs. The Swiss
currency was one of yesterday's biggest beneficiaries, retaining gains made
overnight on the back of a comment from Mr Markus Lusser, the Swiss National
Bank governor, that Swiss rates were likely to remain high.
The peseta failed to benefit from the D-Mark's gentle drift downwards from
the highs it reached earlier this month. This was because of the news on
Thursday that Spain's central government budget deficit had risen sharply.
In the first five months of 1992 the budget deficit rose to 1.1 trillion
(million million) pesetas from 0.7 trillion in the same period last year. A
promise from the government to introduce emergency measures to control the
deficit helped the Spanish currency hold its ground.
The French franc firmed to its best levels against the D-Mark in almost a
month as the political tensions surrounding European monetary union that had
boosted the German currency faded, if only temporarily.
Dealers said some operators were banking on EC politicians sending out
positive signals on monetary union from the summit in Lisbon, and had pushed
to the back of their minds the panic that greeted the Danes' rejection of
union earlier this month.
The franc ended two per cent above its Ecu central rate - the first time for
a month that it has been in positive territory.
The D-mark remained firm agains the enfeebled dollar and gained marginally
against EMS currencies, excluding the French franc.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Rates edge higher
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
The Bank of England failed to take out its forecast liquidity shortage
yesterday in an otherwise dull day on the UK money markets.
Although the Bank was not offered sufficient bills to meet the shortage,
money rates did not move significantly, edging only a little higher on
Thursday's close. The overnight rate touched 12 per cent but hovered for
most of the day at around 10 per cent.
UK interbank rates remain vulnerable to signs that German inflation is still
climbing. Higher than expected growth in German M3 reported earlier this
week means a cut in German base rates is still a long way off. But traders
said they expected money rates to ease a little next week as half year
pressures lifted.
'You always get pressures from certain quarters when people need to square
their positions at the half and quarter year. Rates usually ease a little
afterwards,' said one.
The Bank's initial forecast liquidity shortage was Pounds 950m, but this was
revised twice. In morning operations the Bank purchased bills totalling
Pounds 24m. This included Pounds 15m of band-3 bills at 9 21/32 per cent and
Pounds 9m of band-4 bills at 9 19/32 per cent.
After revising the shortage to Pounds 1bn the Bank bought a further Pounds
164m of bills. This was made up of Pounds 29m of band-1 bills at 9 7/8 per
cent, Pounds 36m of band-3 Treasury bills at 9 21/32 per cent and Pounds 99m
of band-3 bills at the same interest rate as before.
The Bank intervened again in the afternoon buying Pounds 412m of band-1
bills, Pounds 151m of band-2, Pounds 1m of band-3 Treasury bills and Pounds
11m band-3 bills all at the same rates as above. Late assistance of Pounds
30m brought total help for the day to Pounds 793m. This compared with the
final forecast of a Pounds 1.1bn liquidity shortage.
The key three-month interbank rate rose  1/16 of a point to close at around
10 1/8 per cent. Six month money closed at 10 1/16 per cent compared with
Thursday's close of around 10 per cent.
There was very little activity on the sterling futures market. The September
future moved only two ticks on the day in thin trading.
German call money approached the 9.75 per cent Lombard rate yesterday, but
dealers were confident the Bundesbank would step in with extra liquidity if
necessary to prevent any further market tightening.

FT  27 JUN 92 / International Company News: Tokyo keeps straight corporate
face - The outcome of Japan's 1,824 annual meetings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEFAN WAGSTYL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Yesterday should have been a day of reckoning for many Japanese company
presidents. After a year of falling profits, declining prospects and a
barrowload of corporate scandals, the presidents of 1,824 companies had to
explain themselves before their annual meetings.
In the event, even the heads of those companies which suffered the biggest
embarrassments in the past 12 months got off fairly lightly. Shareholders
were treated to waves of deep bows and ritual apologies, but few real
explanations of the events of the year and no resignations.
Perhaps the slickest performance was staged by Yoh Kurosawa, the president
of the Industrial Bank of Japan, Japan's top corporate bank. Despite the
fact that the bank's former chairman resigned last year over a scandal
involving illegal loans, Mr Kurosawa managed to finish yesterday's general
meeting in just 30 minutes.
'We will make the utmost efforts to regain people's trust,' Mr Kurosawa told
shareholders. 'We understand,' replied the members and IBJ staff in a
chorus.
Hideo Sakamaki, president of Nomura Securities, the stockbroking company
which was also last year involved in financial scandals, had a little more
trouble than Mr Kurosawa. But he, too, avoided entering into any serious
discussions with disgruntled shareholders.
One of the shareholders afterwards complained Nomura had organised
everything so well it was impossible to get answers to questions. 'It was
just a farce,' he said.
The day was considerably harder for Kiichiro Ito, the president of Tokai
Bank, which lost money last year through an illegal loans scheme in which
renegade managers forged certificates of deposit. Mr Ito had to spend two
hours 57 minutes before his shareholders, fending off calls for the
resignations of senior managers over the affair.
Mr Ito insisted that staying in post was a way of shouldering
responsibility. Shareholders angrily dismissed his excuses. 'There was
uproar,' said one man who attended the meeting.
Jiro Yokota, president of Tokyu Corporation, a conglomerate ranging from
railways to department stores, was also made to suffer. An elderly
shareholder interrupted Mr Yokota's opening speech. Shouting through a
megaphone he had smuggled into the hall, the shareholder called for an
explanation of revelations made last year that Inagawakai, a gangster group,
had bought large blocks of Tokyu stock.
Waving newspaper cuttings, the shareholder waited for answers but was told
the company could not comment on press reports because they were all
different. The meeting finished in 28 minutes.
The biggest meeting was held by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone, Japan's
largest company, which is burdened by a particular duty to small
shareholders.
After the company, formerly a government monopoly, was privatised in 1987,
millions of ordinary Japanese bought stock at prices of up to Y3.2m. With
the shares now languishing at around Y580,000, some 2,400 investors turned
up to yesterday's meeting demanding action to raise the share price.
The board politely took 34 questions from 10 shareholders. The directors
patiently explained they were trying to improve profits by increasing market
share and cutting costs.
That the meetings passed with so little incident was largely due not to the
patience of shareholders, but a change in the law. In previous years,
critical questioning was led by sokaiya - gangsters who specialise in
disrupting company meetings.
Persistent questioning by sokaiya could sometimes extend meetings into
marathons of as long as 13 hours. Companies which wanted to keep the sokaiya
away had to pay them off in advance - a useful source of income,
particularly for Sumiyoshi, Japan's third largest gangster group which is
known for its sokaiya.
However, a tough new anti-gangster law brought into force this year
yesterday kept the sokaiya at bay. Some 6,800 police were on duty, just to
make sure there was no trouble.

<TEXT>
MICHELIN, the world's largest tyre manufacturer, is on course for a 'big
profit' this year after a period of heavy losses and should resume dividend
payments, according to Mr Francois Michelin, chairman.
Mr Michelin also told a shareholders' meeting in Paris that, although the
group would eventually like to recapitalise, there was 'no urgency' for it
to do so. The Michelin share price has for some time been depressed by
investors' concern about an equity issue.
Michelin has undergone radical rationalisation, which involved 8,500 job
losses last year alone, in an attempt to adapt to the competitive state of
the global tyre market. The benefits of this restructuring enabled it to
reduce net losses from FFr4.81bn in 1990 to FFr699m (Dollars 134m) in 1991.
Mr Eric Bourdais de Charbonniere, finance director, forecast further
recovery this year. 'We are confident that the recovery which began in 1991
will continue in a progressive, steady manner,' he said.
He said that Michelin's sales had risen by 3 per cent in the first five
months of this year, against the same period in 1992. Debt fell from
FFr28.5bn to FFr27.8bn last year.

writedown

<TEXT>
BHP, Australia's biggest company, tipped into the red in the final quarter
of last year following a surprise ADollars 312m (Dollars 236m) write-down of
its troubled investment in Foster's Brewing.
The write-down saw BHP's earnings more than halve from ADollars 1.36bn to
ADollars 588.8bn in the year ended May, 1992 on an 11 per cent fall in
turnover to ADollars 14.96bn.
The company declared a final-quarter loss of ADollars 96.9m after the
write-down against a ADollars 223.2m profit previously. The annual dividend
has been held at 40.5 cents a share.
The write-down was received calmly, with BHP shares holding steady at
ADollars 14.34 on Australian stock exchanges. Analysts noted that underlying
earnings, excluding the write-down, were in line with expectations, falling
21 per cent to ADollars 900.8m.
The result confirmed the company's minerals division as its best earner,
with a net profit contribution of ADollars 653.8m, down 21.2 per cent.
The write-down reflects the diminished value of BHP's interest in
International Brewing Investments (IBI), the vehicle which holds a 32 per
cent interest in Foster's Brewing.

<TEXT>
THE PUBLIC offer of shares in China Steel worth TDollars 10.8bn (Dollars
437m) has closed just 38 per cent subscribed, dealing a severe blow to the
government's privatisation programme, Reuter reports from Taipei.
The 509.5m shares being offered by the government were priced at TDollars
21.14 each. China Steel, which is already listed in Taipei, ended at
TDollars 21.90 yesterday.
Underwriters were yesterday scrambling to place shares with institutional
investors, but clearly will be forced to hold on to many of the shares
themselves.
The issue was linked to last month's offer of global depositary receipts in
the US, Japan and Europe, the first overseas share offer by a Taiwan
company. The GDR issue, 360m shares for some Dollars 320m, was heavily
oversubscribed with demand exceeding supply by a ratio of three to one.

FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Burnfield calls for Pounds 22.7m to fund
Malvern acquisition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BURNFIELD, the specialist engineering group, is asking shareholders for
Pounds 22.7m by way of a 3-for-4 rights issue to pay for an agreed
acquisition of Malvern Instruments from Cray Electronics Holdings.
Malvern Instruments has 33 per cent of the world market in laser-based
particle characterisation equipment which break down particles in substances
such as paper and paint.
Burnfield purchased Malvern, which reported operating profits of Pounds 2m
on sales of Pounds 14.7m for the year to April 30, for Pounds 20m.
It will be incorporated as a third separate business to Burnfield's two
existing ones: Isopad, which makes electric surface heating systems, and
Budenberg, which produces pressure gauges.
Mr Brian McGowan, chairman, who is also chief executive of the industrial
conglomerate Williams Holdings, said he was confident of boosting profits by
bringing Malvern under tight management control.
Worldwide sales of laser-based particle characterisation equipment are
expected to grow from Pounds 40m to about Pounds 70m in four years.
The purchase will eliminate Cray Electronics' debt and allow it to
concentrate on its information technology business.
Burnfield's shares yesterday fell 9p to close at 206p. The new shares are
being offered at 165p. The issue is fully underwritten by Barclays de Zoete
Wedd.
The rights issue is expected to leave Burnfield with net cash of Pounds 4m
which Mr McGowan said would be used for smaller bolt-on acquisitions on the
Continent.
For the year March 31 1991 Burnfield turned a pre-tax loss of Pounds 3.2m
into a profit of Pounds 1.17m.

FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Morland forecasts 28% rise in profits
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORLAND, the Thames Valley-based brewer, yesterday shored up its defences
against a Pounds 101m hostile bid from Greene King with a forecast 28 per
cent increase in pre-tax profits to at least Pounds 7.6m for the year ending
September 30.
Earnings per share were expected to grow 15 per cent to 26.1p; and total
dividends would be raised to 8.4p, 18 per cent higher, the company said in a
circular to shareholders.
Mr Jasper Clutterbuck, Morland's chief executive, said: 'Greene King has
been trying to suggest Morland faces strategic difficulties in the new world
of brewing. Our forecast demonstrates what nonsense this is.'
The forecast does not include any contribution from a trading arrangement
agreed with Courage earlier this month. If the Greene King bid fails,
Morland will brew 20,000 barrels of Courage beers, and Courage will buy a
minimum of 5,000 barrels of Morland's Old Speckled Hen ale a year,
generating additional taxable profits of Pounds 800,000.
'We would have liked to compare our performance with that of Greene King,'
Mr Clutterbuck said, 'But it has not told us what its profits were for last
year. Instead it questions our net asset value. Only on a break-up do
shareholders benefit from asset values - it is profits that pay dividends.'
Mr Clutterbuck added: 'Greene King's offer - 450p cash or a paper equivalent
of about 479p - does not even reward Morland shareholders for owning a top
performing company with an excellent record and prospects, and it certainly
does not contain a premium for control.'
Mr Simon Redman, Greene King's chairman, responded yesterday by describing
the profit forecast as 'feeble'.
He added: 'It does nothing to mask Morland's strategic difficulties of weak
brands, no critical mass, low brewery utilisation, and higher cost
production.'
Morland had attempted to present the deal with Courage as a solution to its
problems. 'In reality it is nothing but a quick fix,' Mr Redman said.
The bid was triggered last month by the Whitbread Investment Company's need
to reduce its stakes in a number of regional brewers to comply with
government legislation. Greene King bought a 28.5 per cent stake in Morland
from Whitbread, and was pledged a further 14.9 per cent if no higher bidder
emerged.
The East Anglian brewer extended its offer to July 2 after announcing last
week that further acceptances of 2.8 per cent had given it control of a
total of 46.22 per cent of Morland's shares.

FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Throgmorton USM accepts purchase offer from
new trust
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE board of Throgmorton USM Trust, a smaller companies investment trust,
yesterday announced that it had accepted a purchase offer from a newly
formed investment trust, to be named Throgmorton 1000 Smallest Companies
Trust.
Throgmorton 1000 has arranged to raise Pounds 12m by a placing of ordinary
shares with warrants attached, and it is estimated that the trust's net
assets will be approximately Pounds 37.1m after the offer for the trust and
placing have been completed.
Throgmorton USM shareholders will be offered Throgmorton 1000 shares
equivalent to 100 per cent of the value of Throgmorton USM's formula asset
value. Its net asset value attributable to shareholders at the end of last
year was Pounds 24.46m.
Another offer is being made to Throgmorton USM warrant holders.
Throgmorton USM was due to be wound up after next year's annual general
meeting, expected in April. Advisers to Throgmorton USM say the deal allows
current shareholders the opportunity either to continue their investment in
a vehicle which shares a similar investment philosophy, or to realise their
investment for cash at a price close to the formula asset value.
The new company will invest in around 100 companies, selected from the 1000
smallest UK quoted companies.
According to the timetable, the preference offer for Throgmorton USM is
assumed to become unconditional on July 23.

Turnover was lower at Pounds 16.1m (Pounds 18.3m). There was an unchanged

A further extraordinary charge of Pounds 77,000 was made in respect of
discontinued activities at Somercotes and Burgess Hill.

FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BM shares slump after Roger Shute steps
down
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARES in BM Group, the construction equipment and engineering group, fell
sharply yesterday following the resignation of the company's founding
chairman, Mr Roger Shute, on the grounds of ill health.
The shares fell 81p to 233p, 165p below the high at which BM's shares were
trading three weeks ago.
Mr Chute's resignation, stemming from an illness that BM described as 'lung,
stress and cigarette' related, took the City by surprise.
While BM yesterday stressed that Mr Howard Sutton, managing director, has
been deeply involved in company decisions for the last 18 months, Mr Shute's
departure to the position of president will hit the company hard. 'The City
when it thinks of BM thinks of Roger Shute,' said Mr Mike Costello, analyst
at Kleinwort Benson.
Mr Shute effectively started to build the company in 1979 when Beazer, the
housebuilding group, split off its engineering companies. Five years later,
with Mr Shute at the helm, Beazer reversed these engineering companies into
the quoted Braham Millar and kept a controlling stake until 1986. Beazer,
now part of Hanson, sold its remaining 28 per cent stake in 1989.
Mr Shute was the force behind a period of rapid growth through a series of
acquisitions. These included Blackwood Hodge, the construction equipment
distributor, and most recently the purchase of Thomas Robinson, the
engineering group.
Mr Shute will now play a roving role as president in Asia where he has
developed strong distribution links with Japanese companies like Hitachi.
The executive chairman position will not immediately be filled. Mr Matthew
Thorne, presently non-executive deputy chairman, will become non-executive
chairman and Mr Cliff Walker, who joined BM at the time of the Thomas
Robinson acquisition, will also join the board.
Mr Thorne said yesterday the group would achieve almost all its targets in
its financial year ending on Tuesday. Gearing would also be reduced from
about 75 per cent to 30 per cent.
'Roger Shute has generated very substantial growth,' Mr Thorne said. 'His
daily operational role has been reducing and the same management team that
has generated that growth is in place.'
Market traders said yesterday that there had been signs of a bear raid on
BM's shares in the past weeks. Questions have been posed about BM's
accounting of acquisitions and how, despite the recession in construction,
the company has managed to report such rapid profits and earnings growth.
Pre-tax profits are forecast at Pounds 45m this year, up from Pounds 34.1m
last year and Pounds 5.1m in 1987.

FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Peter Scott resigns from Aegis
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By GARY MEAD, Marketing Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AEGIS, the London-based holding company for Carat, which dominates the
media-buying scene in Europe, yesterday announced that its chairman, Mr
Peter Scott, is to leave at the end of the year. Mr Scott, 44, will also
step down as Carat's chief executive.
Mr Scott was a founder in 1979 of the London-based WCRS group, which renamed
itself Aegis in 1990.
Yesterday some of Aegis's competitors said Mr Scott's departure was a blow
to Carat, arguing that it could disrupt client relationships.
According to Aegis, Mr Scott's decision stems from his unwillingness to move
to Paris, where Aegis plans to relocate. Much of Aegis's pan-European
activity is already focused in Paris. Thirty-five staff are to lose their
jobs at Aegis's London base; another 15 are likely to stay on, the majority
moving to Paris by the end of the year.
Aegis said the move will enhance management control over its commercial
operations and produce savings of between Pounds 4m-Pounds 5m annually, in
addition to planned savings of Pounds 10m - by reducing overheads and
staffing levels - announced in May.
Last year Aegis recorded pre-tax profits of Pounds 55.16m on turnover of
Pounds 2.1bn, and payed a dividend of 5.85p.
Mr Scott is believed to have resisted the board's decision to shift
management power to Paris but was overruled. Aegis said that following a
spate of recent acquisitions across west Europe it needed to slim down its
management structure and concentrate its operations.
Mr David Reich, Carat's joint operating officer and an Aegis director, has
also decided not to relocate to Paris.
Aegis's deputy chairman, Mr Charles Hochman, 64, has been appointed
executive vice president and chief executive of Carat with effect from July
1 this year. Mr Gilbert Gross, who has a stake of almost 30 per cent, is to
become honorary president of Aegis.

FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Exceptional gain helps Southern Water rise
19%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTHERN Water, which supplies water and sewerage services to the south
coast from Kent to Hampshire, yesterday reported an 19 per cent increase in
pre-tax profits for the year to March 31.
The figure rose from Pounds 97.1m to Pounds 115.1m helped by price increases
and exceptional gains on disposals. Mr William Courtney, chairman, was
delighted with the figures.
Average prices rose 14.7 per cent and there was a Pounds 6m exceptional gain
on the sale of investments in three statutory water companies. However, the
company estimated the recession had cost it Pounds 4m and provisions for bad
debts were doubled to Pounds 5m.
Turnover increased 16 per cent to Pounds 290.7m (Pounds 251.2m), helped by a
75 per cent lift in non-regulated turnover of Pounds 15.5m.
Among the non-core businesses, Southern's 50 per cent stake in Stalwart
Environmental Services was sold to its joint venture partner, SAUR at book
value although provisions of 'a few hundred thousand' were made on the sale,
according to Mr Martyn Webster, group finance director.
Capital expenditure increased 21 per cent to Pounds 171m and the company's
net cash position deteriorated from Pounds 6m to Pounds 1.7m. This, and
lower interest rates, cut net interest received to Pounds 3m (Pounds 6.6m).
Depreciation increased 4.3 per cent to Pounds 29m while infrastructure
renewals were 4.5 per cent higher at Pounds 16.1m.
The tax charge, for advance corporation tax, held steady at Pounds 9.8m and
was helped by last year's introduction of a scrip dividend option, which
saved about Pounds 1m.
Earnings increased 20 per cent to 64.2p (53.4p). A final dividend of 13p
(11.8p) is proposed to make a total of 19.5p (17.7p), an increase of 10 per
cent.
The shares gained 4p to 410p.
COMMENT
These figures, although bang in line with expectations, are slightly better
than they look. Even stripping out the exceptionals, pre-tax profits have
grown 12.4 per cent. That is high compared with the rest of the sector, and
would have been better still without the heavier-than-expected effects of
recession and bad debts. Most of the benefits seem to have flowed from good
cost control and cash management. Growth this year will be more muted as
Southern goes from net cash to net debt and misses out on exceptionals.
Forecast profits of Pounds 120m put the shares on 6.2 times, which is a
touch high relative to its peers, with a yield of 6.5. Although Southern
might provide no haven for aficionados of excitement, it is a safe medium
term bet.

THE FOUNDING family of Liberty defeated yesterday a proposal to enfranchise
all shareholders, and thus undermine their control of the fashion and fabric

Mr Brian Myerson, an investor, was backed by only 19.7 per cent of the
voting shares and 24 per cent of the non-voting shares at the extraordinary
meeting he had requested. He needed 50 per cent and 75 per cent respectively
for his proposals to be carried.
Concerto Capital Corporation, his family's investment vehicle, owns a little
more than 15 per cent and 7 per cent respectively of the two classes of
shares.
The meeting, held in a training room at Liberty's West End store, was
attended by more than 100 shareholders. Mr Myerson presented his case for
the enfranchisement of the non-voting shares, the appointment of additional
non-executive directors to the board and the splitting of the roles of
chairman and chief executive.

FT  27 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Marling Pounds 11.9m in loss and calls for
Pounds 18m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MARLING Industries reported yesterday a plunge from pre-tax profits of
Pounds 3.6m to losses of Pounds 11.9m in the year to March 31, withheld its
final dividend, launched an Pounds 18m rights issue and announced sweeping
changes to its businesses and board.
The group, whose shares closed down 10p at 23p, intends to revert to its
core of industrial and seat webbing and rigid, narrow industrial fabrics. It
is selling Boalloy, the commercial vehicle body maker to its management.
Mr David Abel Smith, chief executive since January, said Boalloy had been a
drain on the group for 18 months because of the slump in vehicle sales. In
the past year, it made operating losses of Pounds 3.6m. Operating losses for
the group totalled Pounds 3.36m. Boalloy is to be sold for Pounds 1 plus the
assumption of Pounds 3.4m of bank debt.
Marling has also stopped funding Airbags, a maker of airbags for automotive
safety systems, and is negotiating to dispose of its 50 per cent interest
with Electrolux Autoliv, its joint venture partner.
Mr Peter Held, its 69-year-old founder and chairman, said yesterday he would
retire before the annual meeting in September. A non-executive chairman was
being sought.
The cash call will raise about Pounds 18m net via the issue of 128.7m new
ordinary 5p shares at 15p each on the basis of four for each 10p share held.
It will fund the redeeming of the convertible preference shares. Some Pounds
4.7m of the issue will go for cash redemption of the preference, Pounds
250,000 goes into the rights and Pounds 720,000 is being waived by the
preference holders, resulting in saving of about Pounds 1m.
Group turnover fell to Pounds 102.7m (Pounds 121.8m). Interest payable of
Pounds 3.6m (Pounds 3.66m) and exceptional charges of Pounds 4.9m (credit
Pounds 531,000) hit the pre-tax line, below which extraordinary costs of
Pounds 18.6m, relating to losses on the disposal of Boalloy and others, led
to retained losses for the year of Pounds 31.5m (Pounds 335,000) and losses
per share of 41.27p.
It has paid an interim dividend of 0.3p. The total last time was 4.2p paid
out of earnings per share of 4.84p.

Yet another store chief complains about customers failing to spend money in
his store ('Music fails to seduce Bentalls' customers', June 23).
But just what are these people doing to 'sell' to us, the public? Tinkling
pianos, gleaming white walls, potted palms. . .it seems they find money for
that, but the one ingredient needed for a successful retailer - ie,
qualified sales staff - is being cut back further and further.
We, the public, can be, and often are, enticed to spend on our clothes, our

and an interest in selling and watch your takings go up.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: Teaching method to ignore
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr PETER TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, The teaching method for mathematics by Mr Toru Kumon ('Japan adds a new
number to its exports', June 20) gave me an instant impression of a bad
April 1 joke. It would fit neatly into that stereotyped niche in my mind
which expects people of particular races to behave in a consistently
peculiar way.
Just to debunk this nonsense I would have liked to have read about a real
attempt to help pupils in their mathematical studies - but, unfortunately,
it did not turn out that way. Here is an author requiring pupils to work
through 3,800 pages in the course of the programme; controlled by specially
trained teachers who would see to it that pupils never deviate from the
elitist path of getting all work perfectly right; goals of conceptual
ability being casually brushed aside.
I began to wonder about the hard grind it would be for the slow learner, and
the ruin it would inflict on those bright children who, in later life, make
out to be the quality engineers on whom we rely so much because of their
natural love and understanding of machinery of all kinds.
I just hope that parents and teachers will ignore this programme of school
text books, or look at it very critically before inflicting it on the ones
in their care.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Trial by rabbit punch: The war of words between Ross Perot
and his presidential rivals is heating up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JUREK MARTIN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
This week has been Ross Perot's compressed primary season. No longer
exclusively surrounded by the adoring and the bedazzled, no longer buoyed by
public opinion polls rising inexorably to the White House, the prospective
and populist independent candidate for the presidency has for the first time
found himself on the defensive. And, for the first time he has unsheathed
his sword, pointed it at his assailant and proclaimed that Republican 'dirty
tricks' orchestrated by George Bush will not prevail. It has been compelling
stuff.
If this year's political form means anything, he ought now to be in trouble,
and maybe he is. But form is dangerous to apply to Perot. Most candidates
painted by all quarters as paranoid, monstrous, demagogic, and a threat to
civil liberties and the US constitution in the space of a single week might
sense something was amiss. He does not, or at least does not admit it, for
the very simple reason that he is convinced that 'the people' can see
through the mud thrown at him for what it is: the last recourse of a corrupt
establishment fighting for its life before it is 'taken out of the barn with
the rest of the trash'.
But the bill of particulars against Mr Perot must be taken seriously. Its
common thread was first given political voice two weeks ago by
Vice-President Dan Quayle, not normally a consensus man. Mr Perot, he said,
was a 'temperamental tycoon who has shown contempt for the US constitution'.
For once Mr Quayle was not alone. Among his unlikely allies was the
neo-liberal New Republic magazine, which went so far as to invoke the
spectre of 'fascism' in an editorial about Mr Perot. Garry Wills, the
eminent writer and contemporary historian, concluded a devastating article
and Perot interview in the New York Review of Books with a one word warning
of the dangers to civil liberties of a Perot presidency: 'duck'.
Less polemically, virtually all the mainstream media have been digging into
the Perot woodwork. The Washington Post has found he ordered private
investigations of the Bush family and had, in 1988, even personally leaked
to the newspaper details of an oil tax break benefiting associates of Mr
Bush (Mr Perot insists he did so in the public interest). The Wall Street
Journal has highlighted another investigation into the private life of a
former Defence Department official whom Mr Perot allegedly felt was
frustrating his attempts to locate Americans held in Indochina.
The New Republic has chipped in with a long article on the history of Mr
Perot's involvement with the PoW issue. It accuses him of frequently
underwriting the missions of unsavoury soldiers of fortune to find Americans
in Indochina. It details the rebuffs he had received from administration
officials dating back to the Nixon era and up to General Colin Powell, now
chairman of the joint chiefs of staff.
Mr Perot, recalling his own conversations with the Pathet Lao 23 years ago,
puts it all down to a cover-up and got some support this week from a Senate
committee which concluded that there were 133 Americans unaccounted for in
Indochina.
Certainly he has a record of fascination with conspiracies and with Mr
Bush's rumoured role in them. He has admitted delving in to the 'October
Surprise' (the purported scheme whereby the Republican campaign of 1980
sought to prevent release by Iran of the US hostages before that year's
election) to see if Mr Bush was personally involved. This week, he cited Mr
Bush's presumed involvement in the Iran-Contra scandal, in the pre-war tilt
to Saddam Hussein and in the savings and loans debacle.
Next, there is the question of the carefully fostered Perot legend. Time
Magazine, nothing if not a weathervane publication, called its cover story
this week, 'Nobody's Perfect.' It questioned, as had Garry Wills, the myth
Mr Perot has fostered about the founding of Electronic Data Systems (EDS) 30
years ago. Far from being created solely on the back of a Dollars 1,000 loan
from his wife, it reported that it was financed by his then substantial
part-time employment contract with the very medical insurance company in
Texas from which EDS secured an early major contract.
Several publications have examined in detail the rigid lifestyle, rules and
regulations of EDS. Mr Perot preferred to hire young ex-soldiers to form his
corporate shock troops. Homosexuals and women were not in favour, though
whether to the extent of illegal discrimination is unclear. He flatly denies
everything and says he only hired private eyes three or four times when
employees were suspected of theft.
To Mr Perot this is all character assassination, curiously timed to coincide
with his birthday this week, when it was thought he would formally announce
his candidacy. To his opponents, it is the unveiling of a character aspiring
to be president who had not until now been subject to much scrutiny, similar
in purpose to that visited just as savagely on Mr Clinton earlier.
As with Mr Clinton, there has been a tendency to lose in the wash much of a
sense of what Mr Perot actually stands for, as opposed to against. He has in
truth spelled out little of his ideas so far and this week put off again the
exposition promised for early July. He also frequently claims that whatever
he did say was wrongly reported by the media which he patently loathes.
The most revealing interview was three weeks ago in the Los Angeles Times,
fleshed out off-the-cuff this week in unambiguous language. He stated that
the US must again become the world's greatest manufacturing power and that
the free trade agreement with low-cost Mexico and the 'tilted' trade deck
with Japan conspired against this.
Protectionism threatened to be a big issue in early primaries, but Jerry
Brown, Tom Harkin and Bob Kerrey for the Democrats and Republican Pat
Buchanan proved otherwise flawed advocates. Only last week, Mr Clinton felt
confident enough in his own free trade convictions to tell a car workers'
convention that he still supported Nafta - not least because it would raise
health and environmental standards in Mexico and thus, by raising costs,
discourage the loss of jobs to south of the border. 'Those jobs are moving
over there like crazy now,' he said.
Mr Perot does not consider himself a protectionist, but his is a
self-definition. He wants the US to consider Germany and Japan as
competitors and, if necessary, to learn from them. 'This is a tiny world,'
he proclaims, from which the US cannot withdraw. But it might change the
rules and it could start by turning all its embassies ('ambassadors are just
social, you know') into economic missions. It is also, he adds, time for the
Germanies and Japans to pay for their own security and for all foreign
lobbyists, especially those employing former US government officials, to be
expelled from Washington.
This is the sort of message his undoubtedly patriotic followers love to hear
and any departure from it might cost him support. But it also scares the
living daylights out of all those who believe that international relations
require frameworks, not all of which can be blithely discarded on a whim.
Sooner or later he may have to choose between the two.
He is also already suspected of waffling on the big issues, such as
taxation. As it stands, Mr Perot, who four years ago said a tax increase was
generally necessary and two months ago said could still be earmarked for
education, now says he would only authorise one in time of war. Also pending
clarification is his assertion that wealthier, older Americans should
voluntarily give up social security benefits. He has taken the idea back to
his computers for number crunching.
What nobody knows is whether this long litany is really beginning to hurt
him. He was obliged this week to interrupt his barnstorming national tour to
go on television and to hold a press conference to address all the nasty
things being said about him in the media.
There were glimpses of what a Perot presidency would be like; a cabinet of
all the talents, regardless of party, task forces on every important
subject, a rewriting of the banking laws to ensure that small business got
enough credit and capital, the White House once again 'a bully pulpit' but
inhabited by a man who would spend as little contaminating time in
Washington as possible. Even some of his handful of would-be friends in the
capital have taken to wondering exactly how this would work.
Yet the quote of the week, from the Washington Post article, was Mr Perot
telling Mr Bush 'the world is full of lions, tigers and rabbits, and you are
a rabbit'. The next stage of this remarkable presidential campaign, now that
the claws are really out, is which of the two of them bleeds most - and
whether the real beneficiary of this all-out war will not turn out to be the
man who knows what it is like to be bruised, Bill Clinton.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: 'City' was never a major investor in Maxwell
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr C M GILCHRIST
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, As the media focus on the Maxwell affair has intensified there have
been increasing calls for 'the City' to do something since 'the City'
encouraged and financed his enterprises, and ultimately failed in its
supervisory role.
But what is meant by 'the City' in this context. Normally one would be
referring to the whole gamut of institutions from banks to insurance
companies and pension funds. Normally one would expect the shareholding of a
publicly quoted company to be represented by, approximately, a third pension
funds, a third insurance companies, and a third other institutions and
private investors.
The sale of 49 per cent of Mirror Group was launched so publicly with mini
prospectuses in the Daily Mirror itself as a response to lack of
institutional interest. In the case of Maxwell Communications Corporation
much of the pension fund losses appear to have been incurred in illicit
buying which increased the Maxwell controlled shareholding to over 80 per
cent. Pension funds and insurance companies clearly did not hold their usual
weightings, or anything like them, in these companies.
The plight of pensioners caught up in this mess is a national disgrace, and
the pensions industry must play its part in ensuring that such a problem
does not recur.
But the investors in Maxwell's companies were not 'the City' as a whole, but
the banks and a few other unfortunate souls. Pension funds and other
traditional investors were, by and large, not involved. This fact should be
recognised.

Sir, Members of Lloyd's facing increasing catastrophe loss cannot be
expected to pay into ever mounting reserves for the continuing US asbestos
and pollution claims. These risks cannot be reinsured at Lloyd's since they
could not have been perceived at inception many decades ago and they are
outside the scope of insurance.
A moratorium should be put on increasing open syndicate reserves as these
are now far in excess of those required by other insurers with whom we
compete, and have dissipated in running costs.
As there is to be no rescue, only a levy on all names, a moratorium could
only encourage some of us to continue underwriting.

<TEXT>
Sir, I would like to thank your paper for its clear exposition of the future
of school education (leading article, June 25). In all the rhetoric about
opting-out leading to more parental choice, the position of children with
special educational needs has been ignored. The clear consequence is that
SEN children will have no place within these schools, which is at odds with
the principle enshrined within the 1981 Education Act that, wherever
possible, such children should have their needs met within mainstream
schools.
Parents of these children will have no choice and as the estimate of need is
20 per cent of the school population the government is likely to end up with
a growing band of deeply disgruntled parents. The education secretary needs
to think again, and quickly.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Unsettled on West Bank: This week's election caused dismay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HUGH CARNEGY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
For Rabbi Moshe Levinger, this week's Israeli general election was both a
crushing personal defeat and a stinging setback for the Jewish settlements
in the occupied territories which he helped pioneer.
An election broadcast in which the bearded, bespectacled rabbi, once jailed
briefly for shooting dead an Arab shopkeeper, was seen blasting away with a
pistol did not make the desired impact. Not only did his campaign for the
Knesset, the Israeli parliament, fail, but he was blamed by other settlers
for splitting the right-wing vote and aiding the victory of Mr Yitzhak Rabin
and the Labour party.
But Rabbi Levinger is not about to abandon the militant ideology that drove
him in 1968 to lead a band of settlers into the centre of Hebron, an Arab
town in the then recently captured West Bank. 'Rabin contradicts the whole
of Jewish history,' he exclaimed in his home in the Hebron settlement, a
cluster of heavily-guarded apartments that sits alongside the town's
dishevelled Arab souk.
To make his point, the rabbi spread a map over the table. Alongside, an M-16
rifle leant against a lectern used for family prayers. West Bank places like
Hebron, Nablus, Jericho, Eli and Shillo were all in the heart of Eretz
Israel, the biblical Land of Israel, he said. Jews lived in Hebron until
1929 from ancient times when they were driven out following a massacre.
'This is our country and we cannot stop settlements in Eretz Israel.'
Mr Rabin's promise to halt expansion of most settlements has alarmed the
settlers. They had grown accustomed to unstinting patronage from the
outgoing government led by the Likud party. Their numbers have increased
sharply over the past five years from 60,000 to about 100,000, and there is
space for another 35,000 in houses still under construction.
The settlers are also agitated by Mr Rabin's plan to grant significant
Palestinian self-government as an interim step in Middle East peace talks
before eventually returning most of the occupied territories to some form of
Arab sovereignty. The settlers see this as the path to a Palestinian state.
In Kiryat Arba, the 6,000-strong settlement just outside Hebron, Keren
Maman, who runs a cafe and video shop said: 'There will be bloodshed. We are
not prepared to let the Arabs enter Kiryat Arba.' Shimon Tourgeman, an
elderly grocery store owner, said there would be mass demonstrations by
settlers. 'Palestinian autonomy will never happen because the people here
will never allow it. There are extremists among the residents here.' His
brother, pistol stuffed in his belt, nodded agreement.
The well-armed settlers are capable of violent disruption. Mr Rabin is known
to fear it, remembering the murderous 'Jewish Underground' which sprang up
in the settlements in the early 1980s. But their bark may prove to be more
fearsome than their bite.
For the moment, they refuse to accept that the political tide has turned
against them. Repeatedly in Hebron and in Kiryat Arba, settlers sought to
explain away the election result as anything but a dramatic shift to the
anti-settler Labour and Meretz parties.
Keren Maman blamed the new immigrants from the Soviet Union, most of whom
voted overwhelmingly for Labour and Meretz. Rabbi Levinger said he did not
believe public support for the settlers had been eroded. 'I don't think
attitudes towards Eretz Israel have changed,' he said.
But the election results do suggest a significant swing. The parties which
clearly support settlements slipped back to 49 seats from 52 won at the last
election. The most active pro-settlement party, Tehiya, lost its place in
the Knesset altogether. Labour and Meretz, meanwhile, increased their
combined share from 49 seats to 56.
Beyond their belief in a God-given right to the territories, the settlers
are divided over what future political arrangements might be practical.
Rabbi Levinger talks of favouring a limited form of Palestinian autonomy.
But anything remotely acceptable to the Palestinians is loudly declaimed by
him and other settler leaders.
Some settlers even support the current peace process. Labour and Meretz
outpolled Tehiya and Rabbi Levinger in the settlements. Others espouse
'voluntary transfer' - the removal of the Arab population. Their message is
a barely disguised racism. 'The Arab mentality is like a donkey,' confided
Mr Tourgeman. 'You have to hit him with a stick to keep him going straight.'
In the end, the greatest threat to the settlers is not their nightmare of
the army - or a Palestinian government - one day arriving and forcing them
to evacuate. More serious, is the threat that their communities may be
gradually undermined
Mr Rabin's pledge to halt the Shk3bn (Pounds 660m) a year in direct
investment and remove the high subsidies available to settlers may cause the
many people who move to settlements in search of cheap housing within
commuting distance of Jerusalem or Tel Aviv to think again.
Keren Maman in Kiryat Arba has already sensed this. 'Our cafe depends on
trade from soldiers,' she said. 'If they withdraw, we will have no business.
We are going to be screwed. Everything the Likud did, Labour will ruin.'

FT  27 JUN 92 / Letter: Principles to guide public sector pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr GERARD HOWE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Here we go again on public sector pay ('Playing catch-up with the
private sector fat cats', June 23).
The principles that should guide public sector pay, and which are surely
clear enough by now, are:
Rewards should allow a continuing competent service;
External comparisons - of the whole package - are inevitable. You can debate
the choices and the methodology but not the need;
Take account of the risks and potential among your chosen comparisons as
well as today's figures;
Reward achievement, but balance risk and reward - for both employer and
employee - looking at performance standards, job security, ease of filling
vacancies, proportion of variable pay, etc;
Only then can you make a proper judgement about the overall level and the
make-up of the constituents.
Nobody would suggest that this was easy, but openness about the reasoning is
essential. It may sometimes suggest that the real problems have little to do
with pay.
One thing is clear. If a substantial adjustment really is justified, then
delay makes things worse.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Man In The News: The third phase of Mr Europe - Jacques
Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BUCHAN and IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EC leaders have chosen a new man to lead a new European Community for the
next two crucial years. His name is still Mr Jacques Delors. But this
66-year-old chameleon has now changed his image from Jacques the Power
Grabber into Jacques the Conciliatory Statesman.
This change of mind, if not of heart, made it all the easier for all 12 EC
leaders at their dinner last night in the Queluz Palace to give the
Commission president an unprecedented fifth two-year term at the head of the
EC executive. Even Mr John Major, the UK prime minister, seems confident
that Mr Delors is shedding the image that has made him a hate figure for
some Conservative back-benchers. Not that Mr Delors is backing away from the
high goals of the Maastricht Treaty on political and monetary union. Far
from it. But he now realises that the national debates on the treaty have
opened up an apparent gap between what the 12 governments were able to
negotiate in Maastricht and what European public opinion is able to accept.
Narrowing that gap will be the great challenge of Mr Delors' extra two years
as Commission president. Riding on his success is ratification of
Maastricht, the possibility of the Community being ready for another
integrationist lurch forward at its next planned constitutional revision in
1996, and even Mr Delors' own long-shot chances of a crack at the French
presidency.
The Lisbon summit, and the run-up to it, saw Mr Delors apologising for his
threat that Denmark's rejection of Maastricht might cost it EC farm
subsidies. He conceded he had pitched EC spending plans too high. He has
dropped ideas of early institutional change to accompany the admission of
new countries into the Community. Above all, he has declared his readiness
to return to individual governments some of the powers that have flowed to
Brussels over the past 35 years.
Is this just show? Undoubtedly, Mr Delors will feel and behave in a less
contrite manner, once the shockwaves of Denmark's Maastricht rejection cease
reverberating around the Community. But there are grounds for supposing that
Mr Delors has a longer-lasting interest in 'subsidiarity'. Indeed, it would
be in tune with the way that Mr Delors has realised his vaulting ambition
for the EC, if, having got a hand on some of the levers of political and
monetary power, he were to devolve the less enticing duties of implementing
and supervising EC law to others outside Brussels.
In fact, this is not the first strategic shift in Mr Delors' Brussels
career. It is now possible to see three phases to this:
Mr Delors arrived in Brussels with ideas about a single currency and common
defence, but had to confine himself largely in 1985-88 to the internal
market programme. The latter hardly thrilled him. In his oft-repeated
statement that 'one can hardly fall in love with the single market', Mr
Delors speaks for himself. But he realised it was an essential building
block;
In 1989-91 his ambitions took off, getting aerodynamic shape in the form of
the Maastricht Treaty last December. But, like Icarus, Mr Delors made the
mistake of flying too high. The Commission president saw the inevitability
of an enlarged Community as an opportunity to float further ideas. One was
of a more 'political' EC executive which would not exactly replace the EC's
rotating presidency, but which would come to eclipse it as the sun does the
moon. But Danish voters nearly shot the treaty, and Mr Delors with it, to
the ground;
In his third phase, 1992-94, now opening, Mr Delors' immediate aim is to
keep Maastricht flying. To do this, with a degree of subsidiarity that makes
all member states including Denmark feel comfortable, he has hinted he is
ready to jettison the purist prospect, held out in Phases One and Two, of a
single market.
It is true that, with 90 per cent of the 300 internal market measures
already on the EC statute book, the Commission will now be slapping fewer
legislative proposals down on the Council of Ministers' table. But there
still remains a potential conflict between the single market and
subsidiarity. Because member states do not always trust each other to
implement faithfully EC laws they have nodded through in Brussels, they
often thrust a monitoring role on an unwilling Commission. The danger,
therefore, in handing more responsibilities to governments is that the EC
market will become less single. As Mr Delors said this week: 'The best (the
single market) can be the enemy of the good (subsidiarity).'
Unevenness in the single market, with all this implies in giving some
governments and companies an unfair advantage over others, is clearly a risk
Mr Delors is now ready to take. Are others, especially Mr Major? But even if
Mr Delors now adopts a lower profile, he will still remain Mr Europe, for
better or for worse. Some governments would like to cut the Commission down
to size. But the history of the Community shows that the Commission has
always played an essential role in making the system work.
Will it be up to the sophisticated challenge of now making a more
de-centralised system run more effectively than in the past? Some of the
burden should fall on the other 16 commissioners. However, there are several
pairs of weak shoulders there at the moment. Many may well be kept on by
their governments after January 1 1993. In the current climate, Mr Delors is
even less well-placed than before to demand a say in any new appointments
governments care to make.
So, even though Mr Delors promises to run the Community on a looser rein, he
is liable to continue the same autocratic style of management inside the EC
executive. This may be a handicap in the 'new-look' Community, but it could
also be entirely consistent with Mr Delors' future personal ambitions. At
present, he is one of the most popular figures on the French political
scene. If he makes a success of the next two years in Brussels, he could be
nicely poised for the next French presidential election, scheduled in 1995.
And the one thing that can be safely said of the Fifth Republic is that no
president has ever bothered his head about notions of subsidiarity.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Convergence on mediocrity
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IF ONE were to encapsulate the message in the latest Economic Outlook from
the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, it would be that
policy-makers need to get a grip on themselves. Policy is drifting. The
legacy of the financial profligacy of the 1980s remains worrying. Equally
important are the fiscal problems that the industrial countries are storing
up for themselves.
Last year the performances of the major industrial countries diverged
sharply, stretching from Japan's impressive economic growth of 4.5 per cent,
via Germany's 3.1 per cent, all the way to the US decline of 0.7 per cent
and the UK's still deeper decline of 2.2 per cent. This year, by contrast,
performance is set to be far more uniform. Unfortunately, it is uniform in
its mediocrity.
The OECD believes that the best-performing member of the group of seven
industrial countries this year will be Canada, whose economy is forecast to
grow at only 2.3 per cent, with the US close behind at 2.1 per cent.
Bringing up the rear once more is the battered UK, with economic growth of
0.4 per cent forecast for 1992. Already this looks optimistic. The UK
economy may not grow at all between 1991 and 1992.
When vast numbers of households, non-financial businesses and banks have, in
effect, bet on another bout of 1970s-style inflation, which - to their
credit - policy-makers have not permitted, economic difficulties are
inevitable. With about 3 1/2 per cent inflation expected this year in the
OECD, as against an average of 12 1/2 per cent in the recession of 1974-75
and 9 1/2 per cent in 1980-82, the disillusionment must be profound. But
working through a debt overhang rather than inflating it away, a difficult
enough task in any case, is still more difficult with real interest rates as
high as today's.
Financial difficulties
Short term real rates do not seem so high, at least outside Europe. US
nominal short rates of below 4 per cent are barely positive in real terms,
though those of Japan, at 4 1/2 per cent, still give real rates of nearly 2
per cent. This is quite high enough for an economy facing Japan's financial
difficulties, symbolised by the ever-sliding share price index, which closed
yesterday more than 59 per cent below its peak in early 1989.
Yet in both the US and Japan, the yield curve - the ratio of short term to
long term rates of interest - is at least positively sloped. This is a
fairly reliable indicator of the stance of monetary policy and suggests that
it is expansionary in both cases.
In western Europe, by contrast, monetary policy is very tight indeed. Not
only is the floor for short term rates of interest Germany's 9 3/4 per cent,
but the yield curve is still negatively sloped everywhere. In addition, real
short term rates of interest range from 5 per cent in Germany to about 7 per
cent in France and Italy.
Monetary policy
So far, so gloomy. But in a much discussed paper, Mervyn King, the Bank of
England's chief economist, has argued that investment and much of
consumption depend more on long term real rates of interest than on short
term ones. Taken to its limits, this would suggest that monetary policy,
which works directly on short term rates, is ineffective. But Professor King
has a point. Unhappily, it is not as comforting a one as all that.
The real long term rate of interest, which depends on expected rates of
inflation for many years into the future, would appear unknowable. The
British government has, however, done the world the great favour of issuing
index-linked gilts, which currently yield 4 1/4 per cent. In a globally
integrated capital market, expected real rates of interest should converge,
4 1/4 per cent may, therefore, give no bad indication of the global long
term real interest rate.
It seems rather a high real rate of interest during an economic slowdown -
well above the normal growth rate of the OECD economies, for example. Why,
one might ask, do borrowers have to pay so much? Professor King suggests
that higher prospective returns on investment and lower savings are the
explanation.
The decline in savings rates has been a striking feature of the performance
of the major economies in the 1980s. But in an economic slowdown one might
have expected a lower desire to invest to have offset the lower willingness
to save. The latest OECD Economic Outlook suggests an explanation: a marked
deterioration in the structural fiscal positions of virtually every
significant OECD country between 1989 and 1992, Canada being the sole
exception.
High long term real rates of interest that are the result of excellent
investment opportunities do not imply poor long term prospects for economic
growth. But high long term real rates of interest that reflect low rates of
savings, in general, and fiscal deterioration, in particular, certainly do.
Strong economic recovery may still be possible, at least outside Europe. But
the current high real interest rates are also providing a warning about the
growth that might follow that recovery. The mediocrity may endure.

<TEXT>
MR JOHN GUMMER, the agriculture minister, accused French trawlermen of
stirring up '1,000 years of rivalry and hatred' in the row over fishing
rights around the Scilly Isles.
He presented Mr Louis Mermaz, the French agriculture minister, with a
preliminary report on the incident on Thursday in which French trawler crews
allegedly cut the nets of British boats. The report will be passed to Mr
Charles Josselin, the French fisheries minister.
Mr Gummer said he expected 'immediate and very tough action', but both sides
emphasised that the incident would not be allowed to affect friendly
relations between the two countries.
French fishermen are alleged to have threatened the crews of three British
fishing boats and to have damaged their nets in a dispute over fishing
rights.
Two French trawlers involved were on their way back to their home port of
Concarneau yesterday. Two of the British boats returned to the disputed
waters, 16 miles north of the Scilly Isles, to check the damage to their
nets and recover what was left.
The minesweeper HMS Brecon, whose crew boarded one of the French trawlers,
was heading back to Plymouth. A Royal Navy patrol vessel, HMS Alderney,
plans to remain in the area as long as the fishermen are there.

FT  27 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: Major sets out British priorities
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A DIRECT link between the Community's prospects of rescuing the Maastricht
accords and Britain's determination to decentralise EC decision-making was
drawn yesterday by Mr John Major.
Sketching out Britain's priorities for its presidency, the UK prime minister
said EC leaders must respond to the growing anxieties of European voters
about the direction of the Community.
His comments came as British officials said the Danish vote against
Maastricht had left Mr Major with an important coincidence of interest
between his ambition to decentralise and enlarge the community and his
partners' concern to rescue European union.
Mr Major, who underlined his personal commitment to Maastricht, suggested
that its rejection by the Danish electorate reflected much wider fears
across Europe about the creation of a Brussels 'monster' out of touch with
popular aspirations.
Brushing off the threat of rebellion by Conservative MPs, he insisted that
his government would meet its obligation to ratify Maastricht.
In a contribution to the summit designed to balance his determination to
keep Britain at the 'heart of Europe' against the concerns of Conservative
Euro-sceptics at home, Mr Major set out priorities for the British
presidency.
The first was to give 'life' to the concept of subsidiarity - the devolution
to national governments of powers which had been unnecessarily assumed by
Brussels. He told the summit that the Commission should be obliged to give
more effective justification for all new legislation and should consider
ditching unnecessary or outdated directives.
He suggested that EC governments should supplement that drive to reduce
public concerns about the 'remoteness' of the Community with much greater
efforts to strengthen links between national assemblies and the European
parliament in Strasbourg.
In parallel the Community should demonstrate its commitment to a wider
Europe by finalising a negotiating position for the first batch of Efta
applicants to the Community.
Mr Major said he was ready to meet half-way the insistence of the southern
EC states that negotiations on enlargement should not start until the
Community had established the 'cohesion' fund envisaged at Maastricht.
British officials said the prime minister's refusal to accept an immediate
increase in the Community's financing ceiling in no way undercut his
readiness to see the establishment of a cohesion fund. Mr Major's position
was that there was ample room within the existing constraints to finance
cohesion payments for at least two years.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE EC's poor southern members and Ireland appeared last night to be losing
their battle to win firm commitments now from their richer partners on
increased financial transfers from the Community budget.
Britain and Germany gained majority support for postponing concrete sums
until the Edinburgh summit in December, although both insisted that the
commitment to 'cohesion' reached at Maastricht still stood.
Fears that delays in agreeing the so-called Delors II finance package could
sour public support for Maastricht in the southern countries mean this
summit is likely to reaffirm the EC's commitment to cohesion.
In February, Mr Jacques Delors, European Commission president, proposed
increasing EC revenue by a third from next year to 1997. This would mean a
rise in the budget from Ecu66.7bn (Pounds 46.82bn) now to Ecu87.5bn (Pounds
61.42bn) in 1997, at 1992 prices, yielding an increase from Ecu18.6bn to
Ecu29bn in structural and cohesion finance for the poorer member states.
There is wide consensus on the need to step up spending significantly on
foreign policy and aid. But Mr Delors appears to be backing down on seeking
similar increases for research and training, as part of a more co-ordinated
EC policy to sharpen industry's competitive edge.
Faced with unyielding opposition led by Britain and Germany yesterday, he
suggested postponing the overall increase in revenue for two years, with his
original proposals coming into effect in 1995-99.
A majority was crystallising around this compromise last night, with Spain,
Ireland, Greece and Portugal (with some support from France) holding out
against it.
Mr Felipe Gonzalez, Spanish prime minister, said the original Commission
proposals were the minimum Spain could accept. Postponement to 1999 would
give the impression that economic and monetary union - scheduled for 1997 or
1999 at the latest - was being postponed.
President Francois Mitterrand said 'we have to fulfil all the undertakings
of Maastricht, but especially the structural commitments.'
The UK, which takes over the EC presidency next week and will have to
conclude the debate on EC future financing, said there was still Ecu5.7bn in
headroom under the existing budgetary ceiling, without raising it by a
third. It added that further cuts in the farm budget, and the net
contributions of new entrants to the EC from the Nordic and Alpine
countries, would add still further financial flexibility.

THE constitution committee of the German parliament yesterday agreed on a
new clause on European union to be inserted in the German constitution,
opening the way for ratification of the Maastricht treaty.
The German government, however, has reserved its position, and may yet seek
to water down the clause, which would significantly increase the powers of
the 16 federal states in future EC negotiations.
The compromise requires any future transfer of sovereignty to the European
Community to be approved by the 16 states in the Bundesrat, the upper house
of the German parliament. That needs a two-thirds majority.
More controversially for the government, it also means involving the states
in day-to-day negotiations in Brussels. The government would have to heed
the views of the states wherever their authority wasaffected.
The amendment also includes provision for non-German EC citizens to vote in
local elections, and for the powers of the German Bundesbank to be
transferred to a European central bank.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE chief executive of Standard Chartered's Indian operations, Mr Parvesh S.
Nat, has been relieved from duty until the end of the investigation into
India's worst-ever securities market scandal.
This follows the arrest earlier this week of nine people, including two
leading brokers in Bombay, and the dismissal of two Standard Chartered
securities dealers at its Bombay office. Mr David Gardiner, executive
director, corporate banking, will take over until Mr Nat's future is
decided.
Standard Chartered, a UK-based international bank, announced on June 12 that
it was launching criminal proceedings in India to recover Rs8.9bn (Pounds
171m) from brokers and others believed to have defrauded it through the
securities market in Bombay.
Last night the bank confirmed Mr Nat had been suspended but declined to
comment. His suspension follows an allegation in court yesterday by a lawyer
of Mr Arvind Lal, one of the two Standard Chartered dismissed officials,
that a cheque for Rs1.04m had been issued by Mr Hiten Dalal, a broker, to Mr
Nat's wife.
Mr Dalal was one of the nine people arrested early this week and he and the
others are currently petitioning for bail from a special court set up by the
Indian government.
The possibility that Mr Nat, one of India's best respected bankers, may have
been involved in the securities market scandal, shocked the financial
community in Bombay yesterday. Mr Nat is a career banker in his fifties who
has spent nearly three decades with Standard Chartered, holding senior
positions in its operations in India and the Gulf. He was previously the
manager of the UAE operation in Dubai.
Standard Chartered has already had to make provisions of Pounds 50m against
possible losses as a result of the scandal. Its total exposure is thought to
be around Pounds 100m. The total losses to the nine banks hit by the fraud,
are thought to total around Rs. 30.8bn.
Earlier this month, the Indian government gave itself powers to seize the
assets of brokers and others suspected of fraud in order to assist Standard
Chartered and other banks recover much of the money owed to them without
having to resort to court action.

OPPONENTS of a liberalised abortion law in Germany will challenge it in the
constitutional court in Karlsruhe, following a clear majority vote in favour
in the Bundestag early yesterday morning.
The Roman Catholic church also promised to continue its campaign to prevent
the law being put into effect.
The compromise agreed yesterday by a vote of 357-284, after 14 hours of
debate and two hours of voting, would allow a pregnancy to be terminated up
to 12 weeks from conception, provided the mother had been given formal
counselling at least three days before the operation.
An attempt by a majority of the Christian Democrats and Christian Social
Union in the Bundestag to pass an alternative, which would in effect
maintain the present highly-restrictive West German abortion law, failed to
gain the necessary absolute majority.
A new law was necessary following German unification, to reconcile the
virtual abortion-on-demand in east Germany with the western prohibition,
unleashing a stormy two-year long debate.

<TEXT>
JAPAN'S industrial output plummeted in May by 8.7 per cent compared to a
year ago, the most severe year-on-year decline since 1975, the Ministry of
International Trade and Industry said yesterday.
However, it was insufficient to encourage any drop in the high levels of
inventories, which rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.4 per cent during the
month compared to April. Inventories were 5.5 per cent higher than a year
ago.
Shipments declined by 1.4 per cent, month-to-month, indicating that final
demand is still declining.
The rise in inventories suggests industrial output will decline further in
the months ahead as manufacturers cut production to clear the overhang of
unsold goods. Yesterday's figures also bring into question the timing of an
expected recovery, which the government expects to come in the autumn.
Sales at large-scale stores in Japan rose by 0.3 per cent in May, compared
to a year ago, Miti said. However, the increases were concentrated in
supermarkets, while department store sales declined by 0.7 per cent. The
declines reflected consumer preferences for cheaper goods.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PROPOSALS FOR increasing taxes on foreign companies operating in the US have
drawn a sharp attack from the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development, the Paris-based grouping of the main industrialised countries.
Joining criticism from several individual European countries, the OECD says
the proposals, contained in a draft bill put forward last month in Congress
and endorsed this week by Mr Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic
presidential candidate, would force the US to violate its tax treaties with
other countries.
Mr Jean-Claude Paye, OECD secretary general, has written to Mr Nicholas
Brady, US Treasury secretary, to warn that the bill, in its present form,
'could have a damaging effect on the future development of world trade and
to the long-run interests of the US'.
The OECD committee on fiscal affairs, which brings together representatives
of the tax administrations of the 24 member countries, complained
particularly at a meeting this week about a measure to tax foreign companies
as if their profit margin on gross receipts were at least three-quarters of
the industry average, regardless of whether or not they actually made a
profit.
This would be a serious breach of the OECD's rules on transfer pricing and
could violate the non-discrimination article of some tax conventions, the
committee said.
It also singled out measures to limit tax treaty benefits to qualified
residents of the treaty country. This could hit, for example, a British
subsidiary of a Dutch company.
The tax measures form part of a bill proposed by Mr Dan Rostenkowski and Mr
Bill Gradison, the Democratic and Republican leaders of the House of
Representatives ways and means committee, and are designed to help pay for
Dollars 1bn of tax relief for US-based multinational corporations.
Aides to the two congressmen emphasise that they do not intend to bring it
to a vote this year, but hope by floating a number of ideas to develop a
consensus around measures to be included in a tax package next year.
'The bill is very much a discussion draft,' one aide said.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Rose garden of the east up for sale: Quality fears as
Bulgaria's valuable rose-oil industry changes hands
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By THEODOR TROEV
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WHILE thousands of Bulgarians are out in the fields this month harvesting
rose petals - the country's most valuable crop - the state rose oil
companies are looking for ways to secure the future of this unique industry.
The rose, known as Rosa Damascena, is the only symbol of Bulgaria's
manufacturing which has remained unsurpassed for almost four centuries. The
Bulgarian rose attar is still essential to most haute couture perfumes, as
well as to some body lotions and pharmaceuticals, because it preserves the
scent implanted in the perfume.
Officials from the leading rose oil producing centres - Kazanluk, Karlovo,
and Plovdiv - are almost as reluctant to give precise figures on prices or
annual output as they were under the old communist regime. Exporters say the
current price is about Pounds 3,200 a kilo. The Bulgarian attar generally
dictates prices on the world market because of its quality. Annual
production can be guessed at - the country has about 3,000 hectares of rose
fields and from 500gm-1kg of rose oil can normally be produced from one
hectare.
Bulgaria and Turkey, its main competitor in this field, are reported to have
about 150m rose bushes between them. Other leading producers are Iran,
Morocco and China.
Industry observers say Bulgaria is producing more than half the world's
attar. It enjoys the right combination of climate and soil in its main
rose-growing area, the Valley of Roses, a wind-sheltered valley extending
more than 70 miles along the Balkan mountains range. The oil-producing roses
grown there flower for only 30 days a year, from mid-May to mid-June, and
are picked in the early morning - otherwise the unique aroma disappears.
As thousands of Bulgarians and foreign visitors enjoy the annual festival,
industry officials are asking how the political changes in the country may
affect the industry.
The consequences of restitution of the land to its former owners, which is
already taking place, and the future privatisation of state companies, are
some of the concerns. The rose oil industry is still 96 per cent
state-owned, but the pre-communist owners will have the right to re-claim
land once the restitution bill is passed.
Mr Evgeni Hristov, president of the Research Institute of the Rose in
Kazanluk, said he was worried over whether new landowners would buy their
seedlings from the institute, which controls the country's rose quality.
'Our main task is to keep up the quality of the world-famous Kazanluk Rose
that we have been selecting for such a long time,' Mr Hristov said.
The institute has been state-owned since it was founded in 1907, but its
current administration hopes to transform it into a joint stock company with
possible foreign participation. Since economic reforms started last year,
the institute has become a state-owned limited liability company,
self-financed mainly through the sale of seedlings.
A number of foreign companies have shown interest in the cultivation of
roses and other essential oil crops, such as lavender and spearmint. The
Bulgarian Rose Company in Kazanluk has been negotiating with Belgian and
German partners for the processing of these crops. An Italian businessman
visited the Research Institute of the Rose last week to discuss the
production of beauty creams based on Bulgarian rose-pronounced compositions.
Pharmachim, a Bulgarian state-owned joint stock company, is the leading
exporter of the country's Rose Gold. Fragrance-producing companies, such as
the Swiss-French Givaudan-Roure, the American IFF (International Flavours
and Fragrances), the Dutch-British Kuest, the French Charabot, or the
British-American Bush Boac Alan are some of its traditional customers. Such
companies then deal with the top perfume manufacturers and Bulgaria's attar
finds its way worldwide and back to its country of origin as an essential
ingredient of Tosca, Opium, or Carrera, to name but a few of the perfumes.
The Bulgarians, who badly need foreign currency for their ailing economy,
say they welcome western partnership. They are still cautious, however, when
it comes to direct foreign investment and partnership in their most
prestigious industry. American companies have been trying to invest in the
cultivation of roses, provided there would be offers to buy all the rose oil
produced. Bulgaria has been reluctant to make such a deal for fear of
over-dependence on one client and loss of its traditional European markets.
Mr Lalyu Chavdarov, production manager of the Kazanluk institute, said he
believed strict controls would have to stay as the industry opened to
private and foreign investment.
'Such central control may not seem to correspond with the free market
principles, but otherwise profit-hungry private companies may ruin the image
of our rose oil with attempts to sell sham products,' he said.

HUNDREDS of French farmers in tractors yesterday blockaded the road
entrances to Eurodisney and condemned US companies for 'trying to force
Europeans out of world markets'.
The demonstration, code-named 'Operation Mickey', is the latest development
in French farmers' protests against the European Community's agricultural
reform.
Farmers have been demonstrating across France for several weeks against
planned cuts in guaranteed prices and enforced reductions in cultivated area
which small farmers fear will drive them off the land.
Mr Luc Guyau, who was on Thursday elected president of the French farmers
union, declared that his members did not 'want to see France colonised by
Euro Disneylands'.
Protest leader Jean-Louis Colas of the mainstream farmers' union FNSEA said:
'We chose Euro Disneyland because it is a symbol. It is built on
agricultural land.
'It also symbolises America. Without American pressure, the reform of the
European agricultural policy could have been different,' he said.
Operation Mickey is the latest in a long list of problems to have hit Euro
Disneyland, since its opening in April as Europe's largest and most
expensive theme park. As well as the intellectuals' attacks, the park has
been hit by bad publicity over rows with suppliers and rumours of poor
attendances.
The farmers' protest began early yesterday morning when hundreds of
agricultural workers from neighbouring areas converged on the theme park at
Marne La Vallee outside Paris. By mid-morning an estimated 500 farmers with
more than 200 tractors had encircled the park closing the access roads to
the car parks.
Two squads of riot police were dispatched to Euro Disneyland but there were
no disturbances. The farmers dispersed at lunchtime after posing by their
tractors for the television cameras and the park opened as usual. However
the road-block did trap thousands of would-be visitors including 80 coaches,
carrying 2,000 school children, and more than 100 cars.
For the farmers, who earlier this week were forced to abandon plans to stage
a similar road-block around the French government's congress at Versailles,
the Euro Disneyland demonstration was a successful publicity coup.
Euro Disneyland has been left to brace itself for the chilling prospect that
it could be a target for future French political protests. 'We are still
assessing the situation,' said a spokesman.

THE US Supreme Court ruled yesterday that airport authorities may ban
religious and other groups from soliciting for money at their facilities,
but may not stop them handing out literature.
In another important ruling, the court found that the state of Mississippi
still had not done enough to rectify its history of racial segregation in
higher education.
Both verdicts are being minutely examined for hints as to how the court will
rule on the highly controversial Pennsylvania abortion case, a judgment now
expected on Monday.
A common conclusion is that the court is not proving as reflexively
conservative as suggested by its political heritage, which has been
accentuated by the appointments to the bench of presidents Reagan and Bush.
However, there were reports yesterday that the abortion ruling had been
delayed until Monday to permit either Justice John Paul Stevens or Harry
Blackmun, who have supported freedom of choice, to write even more
blistering dissents over the weekend.
The airports ruling was on a case in which the Hare Krishna sect had
challenged a New York ban on their presence at airports.
Passengers at many US air terminals have to run a gauntlet of appeals from
religious, charitable and political groups, with a background public address
announcement saying that the airport authority was in no way approving of
such activities.
The judgments show how finely the court is now divided. It issued two
rulings, the first, banning solicitation, determined that an airport is not
'a public forum' under the constitution, the second found that to ban
leafletting would be to abridge the constitutional protection of free
speech.
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, the first woman on the court and an
increasingly influential swing vote, produced laughter in court yesterday
when she declared 'if anyone can figure that out, they're doing well'.

A MEETING of heads of the Commonwealth of Independent States yesterday
failed to agree on crucial procedures to establish separate currencies.
Disagreement between Russia and Ukraine was blamed for the failure to sign
an agreement on the most critical of economic issues between the republics.
Mr Alexander Granberg, the economic adviser to Mr Boris Yeltsin, the Russian
president, said last night that the Ukrainian delegation had 'put in doubt'
the arrangements for transferring cash roubles to Russia when Ukraine
introduces its own currency in three months time. Mr Granberg said that the
only price Russia was prepared to pay for the roubles was 'the cost of
printing them'.
The disagreement is significant because the issue had been said to have been
agreed between Mr Yeltsin and Mr Leonid Kravchuk, the Ukrainian president,
in talks earlier this week at Dagomys on the Black Sea coast. Mr Yegor
Gaidar,the Russian acting prime minister, said after the meeting that the
issue would be discussed again in Moscow on July 6, where he hoped an
agreement would be signed.
A deal between the republics on which would introduce their own currencies
and which would stay within the rouble zone is now regarded by Russia as
crucial to the stability of the rouble.
Mr Sergei Glaziev, the deputy foreign economic relations minister, said
yesterday that other republics were simply expanding credit - extended by
the Russian Central Bank - to compensate for the extra price of goods
provided by Russia.
Russia plans to unify its exchange rate on July 1, and to move towards a
convertible currency in September. Mr Glaziev said the unification of the
present three exchange rates will mean a saving to the Russian budget of
Rbs500bn over the remainder of the year as subsidies paid to keep the rouble
artificially high for the sake of exporters are cut.
July 1 will also see the introduction of import taxes at a basic rate of 5
per cent, the lowering of some export duties and the auctioning of export
licenses.
Western bankers have agreed another 90-day deferral of the principal on the
commercial debt owed by the former Soviet Union, writes David Waller from
Frankfurt.

FT  27 JUN 92 / Bush calls crisis meeting over aid airlift for Bosnia:
Possibility of military action played down
</HEADLINE>

US PRESIDENT George Bush yesterday called an emergency meeting of his top
security advisers to discuss the rapidly worsening situation in Bosnia and
the implementation of an international aid airlift to the region's
beleaguered population.
The meeting, attended by Mr James Baker, secretary of state, Mr Dick Cheney,
defence secretary, and Mr Brent Scowcroft, national security adviser, was
convened amid harrowing reports of the plight of 300,000 starving people,
blockaded by Serbian forces in the Bosnian capital of Sarajevo.
But US officials played down speculation that Washington and its allies were
contemplating military action to end the fighting, mainly between the
region's Serbs and Moslems.
Before the meeting, Mr Baker said he did not believe the international
community had the authority under current United Nations resolutions to use
force to ensure humanitarian aid reached its destination.
Nor, inspite of regular continuous consultations between members of the
Security Council, were there were no any plans to pass a new UN resolution
authorising the use of force at this stage, a senior State Department
official said.
The Pentagon confirmed that US forces in Europe were on alert transport food
and medical supplies to the population of Sarajevo but stressed that the
go-ahead would be given only when a ceasefire was in place.
EC government leaders meeting in Lisbon yesterday were divided over what to
do about the Bosnian crisis and generally cautious over suggestions that
force could be used to open Sarajevo airport.
French president Francois Mitterrand called for tough measures, but did not
spell these out. However, his spokesman was cool about proposals for
military intervention and emphasised that 'Europe had neither the vocation
nor the means to be a policeman in Yugoslavia'. Britain, too, remained
sceptical about military intervention. Officials suggested it would take up
to 100,000 troops to secure Sarajevo and Serbian-controlled hills around the
city. It is clear, however, that Washington's European allies are seriously
considering their participation in a US-led humanitarian airlift for Bosnia
if there is an effective ceasefire.
'If there is an effective ceasefire that lasts long enough to allow a
multilateral operation safely, we would be ready to play our part,' a senior
British official said. He stressed that such an operation should not involve
the use of ground forces.
Western European Union officials meeting in London concluded that it was
feasible, in principle, for member countries clamp a to put into effect a
naval embargo on of Serbia and agreed to examine ways in which the nine
member countries could participate in the proposed airlift.
On the ground General Ratko Mladic, the commander of Serb forces in
Bosnia-Hercegovina, lashed out at western countries and warned that Serbs
were ready to continue their fight. His speech contrasted with yesterday's
call by Mr Radovan Karadzic, Bosnia's nationalist Serb leader, for 'an
immediate halt to all artillery attacks on Sarajevo' and the withdrawal of
anti-aircraft guns from the Serb-held city airport. Shelling continued
yesterday in parts of the city in defiance of Mr Karadzic's order.

FT  26 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: BP news too late to affect share
prices
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TERRY BYLAND, UK Stock Market Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SHARE prices on the London stock market yesterday recovered most of the
losses of the previous session, helped along by a further rally in tobacco
issues and buying orders from marketmakers needing stock ahead of the close
today of the equity market trading account.
But the shock announcement, after market hours, that the British Petroleum
chairman had resigned set the stage for a difficult opening for the stock
market this morning.
Earlier, the corporate news background had been brighter than in some recent
sessions. Confirmation of details of the share placing by Wellcome brought
no unexpected surprises, with the Pounds 3bn total in line with
expectations. Shares in Midland Bank moved ahead strongly in line with the
performance of Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation as its bid for the
UK clearer drew to its close yesterday. The return to profits at TSB was
also helpful but not exciting for the stock market.
With Tokyo and New York again in better form overnight, London opened
sharply better and, with only a brief check, the market moved ahead
steadily. Wall Street advanced early in its new session but stumbled a
little to leave a rise of 8 Dow points in UK hours, and gains were trimmed a
little in London in late dealings.
The final reading put the FT-SE Index at 2,557.3 for a gain of 24.7, almost
a complete reversal of the fall of the previous day. Several programme
trades were reported but dealers said these had little effect on the market.
Seaq-reported turnover remained relatively high, with 461.6m shares traded
against 582.1m on Wednesday. Stock Exchange statistics disclosed that
retail, or customer, business on Wednesday totalled Pounds 1.2bn, confirming
that the big institutions had been sellers of stock on a day when the
Footsie fell 28 points.
Once again, trading was stock specific yesterday. ICI gained ground but
recorded turnover barely above the 500,000-share mark. Glaxo, on the other
hand, made little move but was traded briskly.
The strongest recoveries came yesterday in stocks which had been hardest hit
in Wednesday's selling bout. Prominent among them were the tobacco issues,
where BAT Industries and Rothmans International stood out. The latter
benefited from trading figures but traders stressed that it was the
reappraisal of the US Supreme Court ruling on health liability that
sustained the shares. British Aerospace staged a significant rally from the
weakness of the earlier part of this week.
While the two-week trading account has seen share prices relinquishing some
of the gains achieved in the weeks following the UK general election in
April, it has been a highly erratic performance.
Marketmaking firms were hard at work yesterday picking up stock to meet
selling agreements entered into earlier in the week. As often in current
markets, the stock index futures sector dominated much of the proceedings.
The September contract on the FT-SE Index attracted support, and the
expanding premium gave sustenance to the underlying blue chip stocks.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SQUEEZE in stock index futures helped the September contract shake off
recent gloom and move firmly ahead, writes Joel Kibazo.
Having opened positively at 2,588, the September FT-SE contract briefly went
into retreat as independent sellers moved to the selling tack. But the
decline did not last long, as large institutions that had remained on the
sidelines over the last few sessions re-entered the market on the view that
it had been oversold.
Except for occasional lulls, September continued forward for the rest of the
session at a healthy premium. The contract reached the day's high of 2,609
towards the end of the session. September closed at 2,603, up 21 from the
previous day and about 60 points above its estimated fair value premium to
cash of about 35. Turnover at 7,231 was, however, unexceptional.
Volume in traded options returned to more modest levels and the day's total
reached 37,629 contracts. Turnover in the FT-SE option was a poor 7,180
lots. In stock options, British Steel, which reports results on Monday, was
the most heavily traded with 3,032 contracts dealt.

FT  26 JUN 92 / London Stock Exchange: Oil sector braced for selling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER PRICE, STEVE THOMPSON, JOEL KIBAZO and COLIN MILLHAM
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OIL SHARE dealers are bracing themselves for a barrage of selling today
following the dramatic resignation after market hours last night of Mr
Robert Horton, chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum.
The chairman's resignation was interpreted by the stock market as a signal
that BP will halve its quarterly dividend from 4.2p to 2.1p when its
second-quarter figures are announced on July 30. Mr Horton has been regarded
as the standard bearer for BP's dividend in the face of the oil company's
huge debt burden and falling profits.
London's closing price for BP of 243p, up 5, was struck before news of Mr
Horton's resignation. In early trading on Wall Street, BP shares plummeted
to around 205p-215p in the wake of the resignation announcement. London
traders fear that BP stock could open at 210p in London this morning. The
oil group, once the UK's biggest company by market capitalisation, has been
relegated to fourth spot.
Analysts believe that the dividend will be cut when the second-quarter
numbers are published. Mr John Toalster, oil specialist at Strauss Turnbull,
said: 'We expected the dividend to be cut by a third in the third quarter
but this news means it will almost certainly be halved in July.'
Burton downgrade
Profit-taking combined with a broker's downgrade left Burton Group 2 1/2 off
at 46 1/2 p after active trading of 5.4m. The shares have risen 16 per cent
in the last three months, and some in the market decided they looked
expensive and took profits.
Securities house Nomura snipped its profits forecast for the next two
trading years, analyst Mr Andy Hughes arguing that Burton's recent good
performance has been based on recovery hopes, but that sales growth in June
has not been as strong as in April and May.
He suspects that the company's debt burden may now be larger than expected,
and is looking for profits of Pounds 17.5m in 1992/93, down Pounds 7.5m, and
for Pounds 35m, against Pounds 47.5m, the year after.
Tesco reaction
Supermarket groups underperformed the market, partly as a result of
analysts' disappointment with a presentation by Tesco on Wednesday, and also
after an overnight programme trade from the US, reported to include UK
stores and food retailers.
Tesco lost 3 to 278p on good turnover of 3.9m shares, as analysts reacted to
the company's presentation by saying that it might be all very well to talk
about cost savings ranging from Pounds 75m to Pounds 120m between now and
1995, through changes in store designs, but why were there no sales figures
for the first quarter?
Mr Jeremy Alun-Jones at Lehman Brothers described the presentation as 'cagey
on current sales', leaving analysts doubting how good the figures are.
It was also pointed out that inflation across Tesco's product range has
fallen to 2 1/2 per cent, apparently held down by low seasonal food prices,
meaning there may be less money than expected passing through the check-out
tills.
The long drawn out battle for control of Midland Bank came to an end with
the news that Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's bid for the bank
had been declared unconditional. HSBC said it had acceptances for around 64
per cent of the Midland equity.
The HSBC bid has been given a very substantial boost by the strong
performance of the Hong Kong market, which helped HSBC shares to rise
sharply. Midland ended the day 22 higher at 452p.
A series of analysts' upgrades caused Whitbread 'A' to jump 21 to 432p,
although turnover was little more than average at 1.8m shares. Brewing
analysts at Cazenove, the company's broker, Nomura, Strauss Turnbull and SG
Warburg Securities revised their profits forecasts upwards following a
presentation by the company.
Mr Derek Brock at Nomura raised his forecast for the current year by Pounds
5m to Pounds 275m.
After being dogged by recent bad news, the holiday sector was provided with
some relief by Airbreak, the USM-quoted tour group. It announced that sales
for the first five months of 1992 were up 75 per cent and average prices
31.5 per cent. Perhaps more importantly, the group said there was little
discounting, the subject which had been undermining the sector's performance
in recent days. Airbreak rose 6 1/2 to 49p, with Airtours rallying 7 to 260p
and Owners Abroad 2 1/2 to 76p.
British Aerospace shrugged off the recent gloom and moved sharply forward on
talk that GEC was taking more than a passing interest.
BAe shares jumped 22 to 272p, although several analysts dismissed the talk
and instead attributed the day's move to bargain hunting. Turnover reached
2.2m. BAe was also busy in traded options, where some 2,149 contracts were
dealt, the equivalent to about 2m shares. GEC edged forward 2 to 228p.
The start-up for the Globex after-hours screen trading service provided a
boost for Reuters shares, which forged ahead 27 to 1130p in thin volume.
The big losses and the sale of the banking and leasing businesses left Brown
Shipley 35 weaker at 80p. Other merchant banking issues were still
restrained by worries that the Isosceles debt refinancing programme has run
into problems.
Other banks performed strongly, with Barclays boosted by a Robert Fleming
buy note. TSB's figures were given a gloomy reception, the stock closing 2
off at 132p.
Tobacco shares, depressed on Wednesday by a US Supreme Court ruling,
recovered as observers suggested that the court decision was not as bad for
the companies as at first appeared likely. BAT Industries strengthened 18 to
751p in solid volume of 5.1m shares. Rothmans 'B' appreciated 24 to 1115p
after announcing a 4.2 per cent rise in annual profits and proposing a
two-for-one share split.
The maintained dividend and an expression of confidence that the
debilitating price war in the plasterboard market has been brought to an end
prompted a flurry of support for BPB shares, which closed 10 ahead at 175p,
after 177p.
P &amp; O bucked the market trend to end 9 cheaper at 464p after broker
Charterhouse Tilney downgraded current year profits expectations.
The market reacted coolly to the detailing of Wellcome's proposed share
flotation, mainly because many of the key elements had been well leaked in
advance. The shares initially shot forward, but retreated in a quiet
pharmaceuticals sector, eventually settling just a penny to the good at
914p.

FT  26 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (America): Dow sheds early rise despite
rate cut hopes
</HEADLINE>

Wall Street
ALTHOUGH the latest economic news had earlier raised investors' hopes of
another interest rate cut, US share prices ended slightly lower yesterday
amid continued concern about the outlook for the economy, writes Patrick
Harverson in New York.
The Dow Jones Industrial Average closed a net 6.69 off at 3,284.01, a
substantial turnround from a 14-point rise achieved by mid-morning. The
Standard &amp; Poor's 500 lost 0.71 at 403.12, while the Nasdaq composite index
dipped 3.19 to 548.20. Turnover on the New York SE came to 182m shares.
Equities received an early boost from news that initial claims for state
unemployment insurance rose by 16,000 in the week ended June 13. Analysts
had been expecting a modest decline in jobless claims, and the figure
increased the chances that the Federal Reserve might cut interest rates one
more time to boost economic activity.
The Commerce Department later announced an upward revision in first-quarter
gross domestic product, from an originally estimated 2.4 per cent growth to
2.7 per cent. Analysts, however, believe that second-quarter GDP growth will
come in well below first quarter levels, probably at under 2 per cent. The
realisation that economic growth is now slowing put share prices under
pressure during the afternoon.
Tobacco issues remained heavily traded in the wake of Wednesday's historic
ruling by the US Supreme Court allowing smokers to use state injury laws to
sue cigarette manufacturers. RJR Nabisco slipped Dollars  3/8 to Dollars 8
7/8 and Philip Morris shed Dollars  1/2 to Dollars 73 1/4 .
Delta Air Lines was down Dollars  1/4 at Dollars 53 3/4 in busy trading in
the wake of a Dollars 1bn issue of new convertible preferred stock priced on
Wednesday night at Dollars 50, with a 21.76 per cent conversion premium.
International Paper gained Dollars  7/8 to Dollars 69 3/8 on a
recommendation from broking house Bear Stearns. Emerson Radio rose Dollars
5/8 to Dollars 2 5/8 on news that the company had settled its litigation
with Fidenas Investment. The settlement means that Fidenas's nominees will
not be opposed by Emerson at its annual meeting in July.
On the Nasdaq market, Lotus Development plunged Dollars 5 3/8 to Dollars 18
3/8 in heavy turnover after the company warned that it expected to report
second-quarter earnings of between 30 and 40 cents a share, well below
analysts' expectations. Lotus blamed slower than expected spreadsheet sales
for the disappointing earnings.
T2 Medical dropped Dollars 5 to Dollars 21 1/2 after a grand jury,
investigating possible conflicts of interest among doctors who refer
patients to laboratory facilities in which the doctors have a financial
stake, requested certain documents from the company.
Canada
LATE declines in oil shares and technical weakness across the board brought
Toronto down from a modest midday gain. NYMEX August oil futures lost 31
cents to close at USDollars 22.58.
The TSE 300 index ended 1.1 off at 3,338.5 on balance, while falls led rises
by 282 to 246 after volume of 36.5m shares.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Foreign Exchanges: Pressure on dollar maintained
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER JOHN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PRESSURE ON the dollar continued as rumours swept through the foreign
exchange markets that official moves were afoot to sell it and support the
yen, writes Peter John.
The dollar was already weak in the morning as it languished under continuing
pressure from worse than expected US durable goods figures announced on
Wednesday.
There was some potential support from news announced mid-morning that
first-quarter GDP figures in the US were better than the market had
forecast. However, there was no significant response.
Then, in the afternoon, speculation grew that the Bank of Japan (BoJ) was
intervening to support its currency by selling dollars and buying yen.
This was compounded later by talk that the US Federal Reserve was checking
yen/dollar rates, a psychological move whereby the Fed rings up dealers to
ask for rates and consequently gives the impression that it is contemplating
an intervention. In most cases the checking acts as support for the dollar,
but yesterday's rumoured move was suggested to be possibly support for the
yen at the request of the BoJ.
The rumours were largely discounted but they sent the US currency tumbling
by more than a yen to Y125.40 in a highly sensitive market.
Mr Michael Feeny, a market analyst with Sumitomo Bank in London, said: 'The
dollar is more susceptible to news providing downward pressure than upward
pressure.'
The dollar was also weaker against the D-Mark, falling by a pfennig to
DM1.542; and in New York ended at DM1.5367 and Y125.17. The D-Mark has been
held up by higher than expected money supply growth figures earlier in the
week. The high M3 figure for May was not counteracted yesterday by hints
that German inflation was easing, and the Bundesbank indicated that it had
no intention of cutting interest rates in the near future.
US investment bank Merrill Lynch argues that the dollar will stay weak
against the D-Mark. The bank says its most recent global investor survey
reveals that international investors are 'actually moderately overweight in
the dollar and underweight in the yen and D-Mark'.
The pound was up sharply on the dollar at midsession and even firmed against
the D-Mark in spite of the continuing flow of funds out of the US unit.
Traders said such flows usually benefit the D-Mark at the expense of
sterling, but there had been such solid support at DM2.9120 in recent days
that the market had temporarily given up on the downside.
Meanwhile, Hungary will launch its long-awaited interbank foreign exchange
market on July 1, the Hungarian central bank announced yesterday, giving the
market more power to set the forint's value.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Money Markets: Overnight rate rises
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH shortages returned to the money markets yesterday and held throughout
the dealing session, prompting a squeeze in overnight rates.
Dealers said the shortage, initially forecast at about Pounds 1.4bn and
later adjusted down to around Pounds 1.25bn, held because a number of
clearing banks, which had already balanced their books for the half-year,
were unprepared to deal with the Bank of England and be forced to readjust
their accounts.
The shortfall was significantly higher than the previous day's figure of
Pounds 150m, and when dealing opened the Bank of England invited an early
round of bill offers.
However, the clearers were unwilling to enter the market and, at the first
round, the Bank was only able to buy bills worth a total of Pounds 145m. The
stand-off persisted and at the second round only Pounds 139m of bills were
exchanged.
Although there was some improvement in the afternoon, with the Bank buying
Pounds 423m of bills, it had to provide late assistance worth Pounds 415m at
the customary undeclared interest rate shortly before the close at 3.00pm.
This brought total help for the day to Pounds 1.132bn, compared with the
latest forecast of a Pounds 1.25bn liquidity shortage.
The pressure of the continuing shortage was particularly evident on
overnight money rates, pushed up to 13 per cent at one stage before easing
to close around 10 3/16 per cent. One-month rates ended steady at 10 1/8 per
cent and the key three-month rate closed firm at 10 1/16 per cent.
On short sterling futures, the September contract moved within a narrow
range to close marginally easier at 90.17 with just over 7,040 lots traded.
In Paris, the Bank of France left its intervention rate unchanged at 9.6 per
cent at a securities repurchase tender held yesterday to allocate funds for
injection into the money market today. It accepted bids for FFr11.5bn in new
liquidity, FFr18.5bn less than the FFr30bn leaving the market today when a
previous pact expires.
The intervention rate was last changed on December 23, when it was raised by
35 basis points. The central bank said it drained funds because it expects
bank liquidity to increase as a result of Treasury operations next week.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Chateau quality crosses the
Andes - An invasion that is revolutionising Chilean wine
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By LESLIE CRAWFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
UNTIL QUITE recently, Chile's vineyard owners could boast of their
unpronounceable Basque names, family lineages dating back to the Spanish
conquest, and little else. Wine-making, like the local aristocracy, was
trapped in a time-warp. The industry was both moribund and unprofitable.
This was before globe-trotting foreign vintners set their eyes on Chile's
central valley. Mr Miguel Torres of Spain was the first to arrive, in the
early 1980s. He declared Chile a 'wine-makers' paradise' and bought 500
acres in the central valley. Mr Torres was followed by Baron Eric de
Rothschild of France's Chateau Lafite, California's Franciscan Vineyards and
most recently by Mr Bruno Prats of Chateau Cos D'Estournel.
A recent survey by the Wine Spectator found Chile to be the most popular
destination among foreign investors in the business. Even banks such as the
Toronto Trust of Canada are buying vineyards in Chile.
They are being lured by land values that are a fraction of those in the Napa
Valley or Bordeaux, the virtual absence of vine pests and a climate that is
ideal for viticulture: hot, dry summers cooled by Pacific breezes at night.
The foreigners have entered into a race to produce moderately-priced quality
wines out of Chile, and local winemakers have been quick to take up the
challenge. An estimated Dollars 100m is being invested in land purchases,
planting new vines and importing technology to modernise Chile's antiquated
wineries. Some 25,000 acres of vineyards will come into production in four
to five years' time.
The fortunes of Los Vascos, an ailing 230-year-old vineyard owned by Mr
Jorge Eyzaguirre, staged a fairy-tale recovery after Baron Eric de
Rothschild bought half of the estate in 1989. A new state-of-the-art winery
was built in 60 days with Baron Eric scrapping the quaint old wooden barrels
and introduced temperature-controlled stainless steel tanks to improve
maceration. He sends his chief enologist, Mr Gilbert Rokvam, to supervise
the vendime (harvest) every March. Mr Rokvam brought French oak barriques
crafted at Chateau Lafite to age Los Vascos' Cabernet Sauvignon. After four
vendimes, Mr Rokvam says: 'We are creating a French chateau in Chile in the
tradition of the great Bordeaux wines'.
The revolution at Los Vascos has been so complete that Mr Eyzaguirre refers
to his pre-1989 vintages as 'old testament", in contrast to his 'new
testament' wines fashioned by Chateau Lafite. The Rothschild calling card
has also opened up foreign markets. Almost the entire production from the
550-acre estate of Los Vascos, about 150,000 cases a year, is exported to 24
countries. It is almost impossible to get hold of a Los Vascos bottle in
Chile, unless you are invited to lunch at the Eyzaguirre's 200-year-old
hacienda.
Mr Eduardo Chadwick, the great-great grandson of the founder of the
Errazuriz Panquehue vineyard, struck a similar partnership with Franciscan
Vineyards three years ago. He says the Californians' expertise came just at
the right moment.
Franciscan scrapped the old wine-presses, introduced cold fermentation for
white wines, and new oak barriques (small barrels) from the US to lend more
character to the reds. They also introduced the latest vineyard management
techniques - heavy pruning, drip irrigation - that imparted more flavour to
the fruit. Together, they exported 70,000 cases of their Caliterra label in
1991, and demand in the US is growing by 50 per cent each year.
'We can taste the improvements with every new vintage,' Mr Chadwick says.
'In five more years Chilean winemaking will have come of age.'
Mr Chadwick and Franciscan Vineyards parted company earlier this year
because of differences over expansion plans, but the US winemaker has stayed
in Chile.
Franciscan has just bought 7,500 acres in the hottest new vineyard region in
Chile - the Casablanca valley between Santiago and the port of Valparaiso.
Casablanca is acquiring a reputation for producing the best Chardonnay
grapes in Chile, and land prices there have doubled almost overnight.
Franciscan is investing Dollars 6m to transform former grazing fields into a
prime wine estate. The first vines of Merlot, Chardonnay, Cabernet and
Zinfandel, will be imported from California in August. A new winery will be
ready in time for the first harvest in 1994.
European and American palates, meanwhile, have developed a thirst for
Chile's new wines. Exports have grown five-fold in as many years. Chile's
Wine Exporters' Association estimates that 10m cases will be shipped abroad
this year, worth about Dollars 100m. Chile recently overtook Germany as the
third largest wine exporter to the US, behind France and Italy.
With the river of wine flowing out of Chile fast becoming a torrent,
exporters are beginning to lock horns over marketing strategies. Small
vineyards, such as Los Vascos and Errazuriz Panquehue, believe Chile's best
chance is to establish a niche in the quality end of the market. 'Our main
objective is not to grow in volume but to win a better recognition for our
wines,' Mr Chadwick says.
The big players, such as Concha y Toro and Santa Rita, are keen to cash in
on the export bonanza and argue that they are not sacrificing quality for
volume.
Santa Rita's exports have been doubling every year and Mr Rodrigo Buzeta,
the winery's export manager, says he can barely keep up with orders from
abroad. He says Santa Rita will ship 500,000 cases to 30 countries this
year, worth more than Dollars 11m.
But even he acknowledges that this frenzied expansion carries risks. The
European Community is swimming in wine lakes, the world is saturated with
plonk, and wine-lovers are drinking less, although they are spending more on
premium wines. Mr Buzeta says Santa Rita is spending Dollars 3m a year to
maintain the quality of its vineyards while it expands. The company aims to
be producing 100 per cent estate bottled wines by the end of 1994. Even the
race to produce world-class wines, he reflects, requires patience.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Government Bonds: Gilts move higher as trading remains
buoyant
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<TEXT>
UK GOVERNMENT bonds gained more than a quarter of a point as the market
remained buoyant in the wake of Wednesday's successful auction of long-dated
stock.
The Bank of England sold Pounds 2.75bn of 9 per cent Treasury stock due 2012
on Wednesday in its largest-ever gilt auction. Long-dated gilt issues
underperformed in the run-up to the auction because of concern about the
large amount of stock due to go on sale.
However, dealers said that with the auction no longer overhanging the long
end of the market, longer-dated issues are likely to stage a rally,
recouping some of the losses made in the wake of the Danish referendum on
the Maastricht Treaty and ahead of the auction itself.
Dealers warned that the market will be looking ahead to this weekend's EC
meeting in Lisbon for further developments on European economic and monetary
union.
The Liffe gilt futures contract opened at 97.26 and reached a high of 98.00
before slipping back to 97.28. In the cash market, the benchmark 11 3/4 per
cent gilt due 2003/07 rose from 115 25/32 to trade at 116 3/32 by late
afternoon.
GERMAN government bonds slipped back yesterday after rumours circulated that
there may be a new 10-year Federal bond issue next month. The bund futures
contract opened at 87.70 and fell from its high of 87.77 to close at 87.63.
News that inflation in the western German state of Baden-Wurttemberg rose
0.3 per cent in the month to mid-June, giving a 4.2 per cent year-on-year
increase, had little impact on the bund market, dealers said, even though
this represents a slowdown compared with a 4.4 per cent year-on-year rise in
May.
Dealers noted steady buying of Belgian government debt by investors
switching into the D-Mark bloc, leading to a further tightening in the yield
spread over Germany and France. In the last week, 10-year Belgian-German
yield spreads have narrowed from 95 basis points to 87 basis points.
US Treasury prices rose yesterday in response to news of an unexpected
increase in weekly jobless claims.
In late trading, the benchmark 30-year government bond was up  19/32 at 102
9/16 , yielding 7.77 per cent. The two-year note was up  1/8 at 100 3/16
yielding 4.88 per cent.
The buying was sparked by the Labor Department's announcement that in the
week ended June 13 initial claims for state unemployment insurance rose
16,000. The figures surprised the market, which had been expected a modest
decline in claims, and boosted hopes that the Federal Reserve might cut
interest rates to stimulate the flagging economic recovery.
The Fed's key policy-making Open Market Committee meets next Tuesday and
Wednesday to review monetary policy, and bond investors hope that a string
of recent bearish economic data will persuade the FOMC to sanction a policy
ease.
JAPANESE government bonds rallied early yesterday, helped by a strong yen
and firmness in US Treasury bonds overnight. However, profit-taking late in
the session left bond prices only marginally higher on the day.
The yield on the benchmark No 129 issue moved from its opening of 5.32 per
cent to reach 5.285 per cent, but ended the day at 5.315 per cent after
substantial profit-taking. The futures contract climbed from 102.66 to a
high of 102.85 but closed at 102.58 after heavy selling.

KOHLBERG Kravis Roberts (KKR), the New York-based leveraged buy-out
specialist, has agreed to make a Dollars 300m equity investment in TW
Holdings as part of a recapitalisation at the restaurant and food services
group.
If the deal, still subject to some conditions, goes ahead, KKR would end up
with a 47.2 per cent stake in the company, recently described by one analyst
as the fourth-largest US food service operator.
The South Carolina-based company was subject to a leveraged buy-out bid in
the late 1980s. In 1990 and 1991, it made operating profits of Dollars
238.3m and Dollars 224.6m respectively on annual sales of around Dollars
1.4bn. But interest charges on its substantial debts, meant after-tax losses
of Dollars 67.8m in 1990 and Dollars 67.6m in 1991.
Under the proposed recapitalisation, KKR would purchase 100m newly-issued
shares in TW Holdings at Dollars 3 each.

global stock offering

<TEXT>
BANACCI, the Mexican holding company which owns the country's biggest bank,
indefinitely postponed its Dollars 1.4bn global offering of stock yesterday
due to unfavourable conditions in Mexican and international equity markets.
The offering, which would have been the second biggest ever by a Mexican
company, was suspended because Banacci was not willing to sell its stock at
its currently low price. Banacci shares, trading in Mexico yesterday at
17,500 pesos, have fallen 15 per cent since the beginning of the deal.
Banacci shares have fallen amid a major collapse in the Mexico stock market,
triggered by fears that the telephone workers' union would sell its large
stake in Telmex, the telecommunications giant and the biggest company in
Mexico.
The Banacci offering, led by Goldman Sachs from New York and co-led by SG
Warburg in London, initially consisted of around 220m L shares, with each
American depositary sHare and global depositary share equal to four L
shares.
The financial group had hoped to raise as much as Dollars 1.4bn from the
issue, to fund expansion of its banking operations within Mexico.

FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Moderate recovery forecast in US
advertising spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
A MODERATE recovery in the level of spending on advertising in the US print
and electronic media is being forecast by Veronis, Suhler &amp; Associates, the
New York investment bank which specialises in the media and entertainment
sectors.
In its annual report on the US communications industry, the bank says that
while the weakness of the US economy will continue to limit advertising
spending this year, an improvement is expected to begin in 1993.
The report projects a 7.1 per cent compound growth rate in spending on US
advertising between now and 1996, which compares with a rate of just 3.4 per
cent in the period between 1986 and 1991. That would boost annual
advertising spending in the newspaper, magazine, broadcast and cable
television, radio and other media to Dollars 112.6bn in 1996, from Dollars
80.1bn last year.
The main beneficiary of this recovery should be the US newspaper industry,
the report says. Advertising in daily newspapers is forecast to grow from
Dollars 30.4bn in 1991 to Dollars 43.3bn by 1996, a 7.3 per cent annual
growth rate. This would be about three times the 2.4 per cent increase of
the past five years.
Mr John Suhler, a partner in the bank, said the study found that the rise in
US advertising expenditure had exceeded the rate of economic growth over
much of the past 20 years. But since 1988 the effect of corporate
restructuring and the woes of the retail sector had slowed the rate of
increase in the two biggest advertising areas - newspapers and local
television.
This trend, which resulted in a 4.2 per cent fall in 1991 advertising
spending, was accelerated by the US recession.
'Advertising and the consumer mentality have been in a negative environment
for most of the last five years. Our assumption going forward to 1996 is
that advertising will recover, but will lag economic growth,' Mr Suhler
said.
The Veronis, Suhler study also concluded that between now and 1996 there
would be a slight slowing in the growth rate of US consumer spending on
entertainment products such as filmed entertainment, cable television
services, home video cassette sales and rentals, recorded music and books.
While the compound consumer spending growth rate was 9 per cent between 1986
and 1991 after of the introduction of new technologies and services that
fuelled demand, the maturing of these markets pointed to a reduced growth
rate of 7.1 per cent between now and 1996.

Water
</HEADLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YORKSHIRE Water yesterday announced an 8.6 per cent rise in profits and said
its non-regulated, or enterprise, business performed well.
Pre-tax profits advanced from Pounds 114.1m to Pounds 123.9m in the year to
March 31, in line with expectations. The rise was mainly due to average
price rises of 13 per cent, although increased borrowings for capital
expenditure led to an interest charge for the first time.
Turnover was up 13.4 per cent to Pounds 441.2m. This follows a 13.7 per cent
increase to Pounds 219.5m at the interim stage, when profits were 11.7 per
cent higher at Pounds 64.1m.
Turnover in the core water and sewerage business increased by 12 per cent to
Pounds 428.2m. Enterprise businesses, which include the environmental and
property arms, doubled sales to Pounds 13m and generated profits after
financing costs of Pounds 2m.
Operating expenses increased 11.8 per cent and included a
larger-than-expected Pounds 5.5m provision for a land slip at a sewage
treatment works near Huddersfield.
There were also Pounds 4m of reorganisation provisions, Pounds 2m for
additional water pumping to areas of low supply and Pounds 300,000 of
compensation for customers affected by a potential cryptosporidiosis
outbreak in Sheffield.
Capital expenditure in the regulated business increased 16 per cent to
Pounds 290m. Depreciation rose 4.4 per cent to Pounds 44.4m while
infrastructure renewals were up 8.3 per cent to Pounds 66.5m.
Earnings improved by 10.3 per cent to 57.6p (52.2p). A final dividend of 13p
(11.8p) makes a total of 19.5p (17.7p), a 10.2 per cent increase.
COMMENT
Who said water companies are risk free? Despite the predictability of profit
and price increases, Yorkshire's results show how a land slip and other
problems can dent profits, even if the numbers are relatively small.
Although core business results were as expected, there were encouraging
signs from the non-core side. This year should be even better, benefiting
from perhaps Pounds 1m of property profits for the first time, although
unregulated profits are still some way from 10 per cent of the total.
Forecast profits for this year of Pounds 141m put the shares on a multiple
of 7 times, following yesterday's 7p rise to 462p. Given the company's
regulator-friendly image, the shares could go higher as dust from the water
companies' reporting season begins to settle.

FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Wellcome sale could raise about Pounds 3bn
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WELLCOME Trust, the medical charity, indicated yesterday it would sell 330m
shares in Wellcome, the drug company, in next month's international tender
offer. At yesterday's closing share price of 914p, up 1p, the offer would be
worth Pounds 3bn.
The prospectus, published yesterday, said the group expected pre-tax profits
and earnings per share for the year to August 31 to be 'significantly higher
than in the 1991 financial year'.
Analysts are forecasting profits of Pounds 500m to Pounds 510m and earnings
of about 36p per share. In 1991 pre-tax profits were Pounds 402.9m and
earnings per share were 29.3p.
Mr Lawrence Banks, head of corporate finance at Robert Fleming, the merchant
bank co-ordinating the global offer, said the 330m figure was conservative
and he was very confident there would be excess demand. He did not expect to
decrease the issue size.
Mr Roger Gibbs, chairman of the trust, said strong interest had been shown.
The provisional allocation gives 165m to the UK market, 80m to the US, 25m
to Japan and the remainder to be spread around the rest of the world. Within
the UK portion, Pounds 180m-worth of shares is being earmarked for the
public offer.
The company today starts presentations to investors in 29 cities. The
official tender process starts on July 6 and is expected to close on July
24. The UK public offer will close on July 21.
The tender price and basis of allocations should be announced on July 27
with dealings suspended for the first 1 1/2 hours of that trading day.
Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, said yesterday he would emphasise
five of the drug group's strengths to potential buyers. These included the
group's dominance of the growing anti-viral drug market, its promising
research and development pipeline and its emphasis on sales and marketing.
He also pointed to Wellcome's strong volume growth in sales, limiting the
effect of pricing pressures on drugs and the ability to increase margins.
Mr Banks said that retail demand was hard to estimate. So far more than
250,000 people had rung the Wellcome share information office.
Wellcome has about 23,000 individuals on its shareholder register, of which
10,000 are employees.
More than 80 regional stockbrokers are prepared to apply on behalf of
private investors, who can also participate via application forms. Existing
Wellcome shareholders with addresses in the UK will receive a special
application form giving them priority for up to Pounds 5,000-worth of
shares.
Retail investors have to offer to buy shares at the tender price being fixed
through the international book-building process. However as the tender price
will not be announced until a few days after the public offer closes
applicants must specify the value of shares they wish to buy, with a minimum
of Pounds 1,000.
The maximum number of shares that could be sold is 417m. The sale of 330m
shares would reduce the trust's stake from 73.5 per cent to 35.1 per cent.
The trust can increase the issue and Fleming has the option to sell a
further 15 per cent of the final size.
If the maximum 417m were sold, the trust would be left with 25 per cent,
which it says it would retain as a long term investment.
The trust will be paying total commissions of between 3 1/2 and 3 3/4 per
cent of the value of the shares sold.

FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Liberty's fraternity seeks to limit
equality - A report on the challenge to the existing order at the famous
retailer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER PEARSE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TODAY'S extraordinary shareholder meeting at Liberty, the upmarket fabric
and fashion group, will be devoted to the vexed questions of equality and
fraternity.
There is little equality in Liberty's share structure, though it looks as if
the fraternity uniting the many stakes held by the descendants of the
founder and his wife will remain solid enough to see off the issue.
Together they hold between 52 and 55 per cent of the voting shares.
The challenge to the Stewart-Liberty family comes from Mr Brian Myerson, a
London-based South African investor who requisitioned the EGM. Through
Concerto Capital Corporation, his family investment vehicle, he bought the
bulk of his 15 per cent stake in the retailing and wholesaling group last
October. He wants to exploit the Liberty name more fully.
The meeting will be the latest shareholder skirmish in a 10-month saga,
which has thrown the perceived reputations of the protagonists into sharp
relief.
On one side there is the hidebound and cosy Englishness of the 117-year-old
upmarket fashion retailing name, which 'is muddling along'. Based in its
Tudor-style and neo-classical West End store, it is an 'underperforming'
company long on tradition, but shorter on business acumen and drive.
On the other, there is the barbarian at the gates, Mr Myerson, the arrogant
young colonial interloper with a beady eye for the main chance, looking to
put another respected UK institution into play, as he had with Aquascutum.
Neither reputation is completely true.
It is true that Liberty has recently been hit hard by the recession, the
Gulf war, the VAT increase and the impact of the Uniform Business Rate. In
the year to February 1, the group suffered a 21 per cent decline in pre-tax
profits to Pounds 5.66m, with the retailing side tumbling 62 per cent to
Pounds 823,000.
Three stores were closed in the US when the leases expired, leaving one,
only accessible through another shop, and the company no longer has a
European retailing presence since the disposal of the Dutch Metz &amp; Co
venture in 1989 and the short-lived idea for a store in Lyon. Mr Myerson
maintains that for a company with a brand as unique and valuable as Liberty,
it has negligible awareness among consumers internationally.
The board suggests that closing the loss-making US stores was a sign of
good, not poor, management and that licensing is, at the moment, the best
way to progress across the Atlantic.
It points to the lack of success of virtually all cross-border expansion in
retailing, both into and out of the UK. It plans organic growth in the UK,
opening more shops, creating more space in the Regent Street flagship and
pushing hard a London retail joint venture with Muji, a Japanese retailer.
It is also true that a ball Mr Myerson started rolling forced the Aquascutum
board into the arms of a Japanese white knight and that he did emerge about
Pounds 6m richer.
He acknowledges he is not a retailer, rather an investor, though he says he
has been immersed in the sector for four years now. He stresses the need to
have stores overseas to carry the brand, thereby reinforcing the wholesaling
side. 'Otherwise Liberty will dwindle into a small property and wholesaling
business.'
Last October, the board referred him to the Stewart-Liberty family, the
shareholder group he would need as a partner to implement his changes.
Rebuffed by the family, he proposed a Pounds 20m rights issue and the
appointment of a new chief executive in place of Mr Harry Weblin, who is
also chairman.
Those plans have since been changed and the agenda before today's meeting is
Mr Myerson's scheme to enfranchise the non-voting shares, 'no more, no
less'. Of Liberty's shares 70 per cent are voting and the balance
non-voting.
Mr Myerson says that the institutional shareholders he has seen agree with
enfranchisement as a principle and that the exercise has forced Liberty to
renew dormant contact with its non-family investors. 'The institutions
accept that our calculations are fair,' he says, adding: 'There's an element
of understanding and some sympathy among certain Stewart-Liberty members.'
Liberty says that Mr Myerson's scheme is fundamentally flawed and would
disadvantage the holders of the non-voting stock. It adds that it is not
essentially opposed to enfranchisement, but wants to be able to choose the
time and the formula.
Mr Myerson says enfranchisement would lead to more non-executive directors.
Mr Anthony Blackmore, the only one at present, was elected 22 years ago and
is part of the Stewart-Liberty family.
'They need help round the boardroom table, there isn't the depth there,'
says Mr Myerson. The board dismisses the non-executive question as
irrelevant and says it is always looking for non-executives who can make a
contribution.
Mr Weblin says that customers have given him 'quite a towsing' over Mr
Myerson's proposals and both he and Mr John Pugh, Liberty finance director,
are confident that they will be voted down. 'The proxies are looking OK,' Mr
Pugh said last night. The Liberty board wants to get back to running the
business.
Mr Myerson insists today's meeting is 'only round one', that he is 'not in a
hurry and has inevitability on his side'.

FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lower bad debt charge boosts TSB
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A SHARP REDUCTION in the bad debt charge and tight control over costs
enabled TSB Group, the UK's sixth largest banking group, to report pre-tax
profits of Pounds 92m for six months to April 30, compared with losses of
Pounds 150m.
Sir Nicholas Goodison, chairman, said the results were not surprising but
showed the bank was reaping the rewards of its restructuring operations
since the late 1980s. Profits in the second half of the previous year left
full-year losses at Pounds 47m.
'The TSB group is now in much better shape after the hard work of the last
three years,' Sir Nicholas said, announcing that the interim dividend would
be maintained at 3.15p.
TSB's comparative interim loss was incurred after bad debt provisions of
Pounds 422m, following problems in the corporate lending book of Hill
Samuel, its merchant bank subsidiary, which accounted for Pounds 346m. This
time the total charge was Pounds 165m of which Hill Samuel accounted for
Pounds 46m.
The fall enabled the merchant bank to cut its loss from Pounds 324m to
Pounds 54m.
This year's group provision included a Pounds 37m charge for losses at
Mortgage Express, the mortgage company shut down last year. Without this the
provisions for losses in retail banking would have been flat.
Although the result was relatively encouraging when compared with last
year's losses, TSB's operating profit was down from Pounds 272m to Pounds
257m.
City analysts said the results were in line with expectations and suggested
that TSB's core retail banking businesses were faring reasonably well in
spite of poor market conditions.
The recession was blamed for a fall in profits at the group's principal
businesses. TSB Retail Banking made Pounds 121m, down from Pounds 128m, and
TSB Insurance made Pounds 49m, down from Pounds 58m.
Mr Don McCrickard, group chief executive, said TSB was trying to build up
its retail deposit base by improving its deposit account products. During
the half year, it picked up Pounds 1.4bn of higher interest deposits.
TSB has shrunk slightly in size because of the recession and its loan
business is marking time because of slack demand.
Total assets at April 30 were Pounds 25.6bn down from Pounds 27.3bn a year
ago. Net interest income was barely changed at Pounds 487m (Pounds 489m)
while other income rose from Pounds 400m to Pounds 434m.
Although the group's cost income ratio has risen to 72.1 per cent (70.5 per
cent) total operating costs fell from Pounds 658m to Pounds 649m.
Its risk asset ratio has risen from 10.6 per cent in April last year to 12.6
per cent.
Net assets per share at the end of the period were up from 109p to 114p.
Earnings per share were 3.87p, compared with losses of 7.7p.

FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Lasmo to raise extra Dollars 200m from
disposals
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROLAND RUDD and NIKKI TAIT
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LASMO, the oil exploration and production group, said yesterday that
disposal of US property and production assets worth at least Dollars 200m
(Pounds 108m) would more than offset the reduction in the amount raised from
the flotation of Ultramar Corporation.
The initial public offering of shares in the North American oil refining
business, which LASMO inherited when it took over the Ultramar group last
year, finally went ahead yesterday evening in New York. The shares were
priced at Dollars 15.
This was at the lowest end of the revised pricing range suggested by Goldman
Sachs, the US investment bank handling the flotation. The original offer
documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission on May 1, had
suggested a maximum price of Dollars 21 a share. Earlier this week, however,
Goldman reduced the expected price range for the 33m shares on offer to
between Dollars 15 and Dollars 17.
Mr Norman Davidson Kelly, Lasmo's director for corporate development, said
the shortfall in the proceeds from the offer would now be more than made up
by the planned disposals.
Ultramar's oil and gas production business is valued at more than Dollars
100m by Lasmo. A further Dollars 100m could be realised from selling
Ultramar's US property interests.
The property disposals, expected either later this year or early next year,
would be via trade sales. Ultramar has properties in California and the East
Coast.
'It may have to sell one or two things it did not intend to sell', said one
of Lasmo's advisers, 'but the main thing is that it is selling the North
American oil refining business immediately.'
Mr Davidson Kelly said: 'We are very pleased that within six months of
acquiring Ultramar we have been able to sell its refining business and
concentrate our resources on exploration and production.'
Lasmo's disposal of the North American downstream assets, earmarked since it
took over Ultramar, was expected to go to a single buyer. Lack of interest
from potential buyers forced it to seek a flotation.
In the wake of the aborted flotation of GPA Group, the aircraft lessor,
Lasmo shares fell, partly because of nervousness about the new issue market
generally. The shares yesterday firmed 2p, however, to close at 176p.

FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: BPB halved to Pounds 38m but dividend
lifted on hopes of price rises
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
PLASTERBOARD manufacturers can look forward to a sustained recovery after
three disastrous years in which prices fell by more than 50 per cent in real
terms, BPB Industries, Europe's largest producer said yesterday.
The company was announcing a 51 per cent fall in profits due to the severe
recession in the UK and Canada and low plasterboard prices.
Pre-tax profits fell from Pounds 77.8m to Pounds 37.8m on sales down 10 per
cent at Pounds 1.02bn.
Earnings halved to 6p but the company is recommending an increased final
dividend of 7.25p, up from 7p, giving an unchanged total of 11.25p.
Mr John Maxwell, finance director and chief executive designate, said the
growing evidence of price recovery justified the dividend increase.
'Competition has focused on market development, product range, product
quality and customer service instead of even higher discounts to gain
sales,' Mr Maxwell said of the European Gypsum market.
Operating profitability during the year had benefited from cost savings in
the gypsum and the paper divisions.
The savings are likely to improve BPB's competitive position against its
main European rivals, Knauf and Lafarge Coppee.
Plaster and plasterboard sales volumes increased in mainland Europe,
especially in Germany, but the loss of sales in the UK and Canada more than
offset these increases.
Included in the 50 per cent profit fall was a net Pounds 7.6m exceptional
charge relating to Pounds 7.1m of redundancy costs and Pounds 4.1m
additional depreciation provided on surplus plant which was only partly
offset by a Pounds 3.6m profit on the sale of shareholdings.
The previous year, BPB benefited from a Pounds 10.2m net exceptional gain
after receiving insurance proceeds in excess of net book value which offset
redundancy costs of Pounds 12.8m.

CALEDONIA Investments, in which the Cayzer family holds a 46.2 per cent
stake, saw pre-tax profits decline to Pounds 34.7m (Pounds 35.3m) for the
year to March 31.
Mr Peter Buckley, chief executive, said the company was affected by falling
interest rates as it switched from British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings
preference shares and cash deposits to other investments.
Caledonia is proposing to buy up to 10 per cent of its shares at 355p each -
a small premium to Wednesday's closing price. The shares yesterday rose by
23p to 362p.
The final dividend of 9.6p takes the total for the year to 14.4p (13.5p) on
earnings of 24.1p (25p).

FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Brown Shipley to be broken up
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROWN SHIPLEY, the small UK merchant banking group, is to be broken up after
incurring a pre-tax loss of Pounds 27.1m in the year to March 31. The
group's holding company will now consist of stockbroking and investment
management businesses with a net asset value of Pounds 17.3m.
Its banking subsidiary has been sold for Pounds 1 to Kredietbank
Luxembourgeoise, Brown Shipley's main shareholder, while Leasing Management
Services, its other main business, has been sold to Woodchester Investments
for Pounds 5.9m in cash.
The sales complete a process begun in May when Brown Shipley sold its
insurance broking operations to Holmwoods Group for Pounds 30m in cash and
Pounds 3m in paper and its offshore operations to Standard Bank Investment
Corporation of South Africa for Pounds 10m.
Shareholders will be asked to approve the sale of the insurance group at an
extraordinary meeting on July 13. But the stock exchange allowed the sales
of the bank and its leasing subsidiary to go ahead without a meeting because
of KBL's position as Brown Shipley's main shareholder.
Mr William Dacombe, chairman and chief executive, said the decision to break
up the group was forced on it after its main businesses, leasing and
banking, fell into heavy losses.
Leasing Management Services, was hit by lease terminations which produced a
loss of Pounds 15m last year, while the bank's corporate lending book
notched up provisions of Pounds 14.7m. The two combined to drive Brown
Shipley, which made a loss of Pounds 5.5m in 1990/91, into an unsustainable
net loss of Pounds 28.6m in the year to March 31 1992.
At the start of 1991, the group had a total balance sheet of Pounds 1.07bn.
A year later it was down to Pounds 750m. Yesterday the group had a pro forma
balance sheet of Pounds 69.4m.
Mr Dacombe said the group was undercapitalised and had to dispose of its
subsidiaries. 'If we did not have this capital problem we would not be
selling things off,' he added.
The banking group had net assets of Pounds 10.4m at the end of March, but
made a loss of Pounds 32.5m last year. The terms of the sale allow KBL to
continue to use the Brown Shipley name.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Cheap oil price fuels finance problems
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MONTAGNON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE SAD TRUTH about BP's problems is also the simple one. It would be in
much less trouble - and Mr Horton would probably still be chairman - if the
oil price were closer to Dollars 30 than the Dollars 21.50 at which it
closed last night.
At current levels the oil price is not high enough to generate the cash or
the profits needed to cover the heavy expenditure incurred by BP in recent
years as it searched for replacements to its maturing fields in Alaska and
the North Sea.
BP is also still trying to digest an expensive series of acquisitions in the
late 1980s, when it spent Pounds 4.7bn on buying out the minority interest
in Standard Oil of Ohio, Pounds 3.2bn on Britoil and Pounds 2.4bn buying
back its own shares from the Kuwait Investment Office.
Capital expenditure last year was Pounds 4.5bn, equivalent to nearly 14 per
cent of turnover. Outlays have been running at high levels for several
years, and though last year's total was below the Pounds 5.8bn spent in
1988, it still marked a near 20 per cent rise on 1990.
Mr Horton argued that the company's development programmes were 'robust'
even when the oil price was still between Dollars 17 and Dollars 18 last
winter. In practice, however, the persistent weakness of the price had
already condemned BP to steady increases in its debt burden, which now
totals Pounds 8.56bn.
By the end of this year's first quarter, net gearing had risen to 85 per
cent from 78 per cent at the end of the year. This is in marked contrast to
Shell which operates with a much lower level of indebtedness and a more
downstream-oriented business, and is therefore less dependent on the
vagaries of the oil price.
But BP remained defiant when first-quarter profits were insufficient to
cover the regular quarterly dividend of 4.2p a share.
'We have made a judgment that we are at the turning point in the
recessionary cycle and any change to our dividend policy would be
premature,' said Mr David Simon, the deputy chairman who is now to become
chief executive. This policy, on which Mr Horton had staked his reputation,
has become increasingly controversial.

FT  26 JUN 92 / When toughness is not enough: The background to the
resignation of Bob Horton, BP chairman
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN HARGREAVES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
From his earliest days as a senior British Petroleum manager, Mr Bob Horton
talked tough and acted tougher. His tenures in charge, first of oil tankers,
chemicals and then Standard Oil of Ohio, BP's biggest US investment, all
involved ambitious reshapings, loud communication and fewer jobs.
Yesterday Mr Horton found that toughness was not enough to ensure a
continued hold on his lifetime's ambition - the chair of BP.
Mr Horton joined the company as a sponsored student at university in 1957 -
four years before his quieter, more tactful arch-rival, Mr David Simon, who
is as understated as Mr Horton is larger than life. It was Mr Simon who
yesterday carried off the chief executive's title.
Throughout his career, Mr Horton succeeded in some extremely difficult jobs.
His already abrasive style was given further edge during his period at the
head of BP's North American operations. When he first arrived in Cleveland
in 1986, at what was the headquarters of Standard Oil of Ohio, Mr Horton
called a meeting of senior staff and told them that times were hard and that
some would lose their jobs.
He then drastically changed the senior management, bringing on younger and
more vigorous men, something which was a Horton hallmark throughout his
career. In spite of these extensive sackings, Mr Horton was respected and
even liked by many of the old Standard men - at least those who survived the
purge.
His straight talking, his unconcealed ambition and determination to shake a
moribund organisation back into life appealed to the American sense of what
a big company chairman should be like.
Always keenly interested in politics - Mr Horton has been known to suggest
that an alternative career path might have taken in 10 Downing Street - he
was also assiduous in cultivating American civic leaders. He wanted to show
that under new management Standard would be a 'good citizen' and that he
would be a social asset.
He was clever too in cultivating the investment community, with frequent
visits to Wall Street, where his relative openness and feisty good humour
were well received.
On his return to the UK, however, these qualities were less welcomed among
British colleagues. Even in a company which cultivates and prizes ambition,
Mr Horton was seen as pushy and insensitive.
In judging Mr Horton's leadership of BP, it is impossible to avoid these
questions of personality, because Mr Horton made them an issue.
As someone who had spent more than three decades inside one of the most
bureaucratic industrial corporations in the world, Mr Horton came to the top
job in 1990 with a revolutionary manifesto in hand.
Project 1990 contained his proposals to transform a sluggish,
committee-driven corporate system into one capable of discovering and
releasing the entrepreneurial talents of BP's managers - what he called 'the
corporate equivalent of perestroika and glasnost'.
His aim was to shake a culture born in the happy alliance of British
imperial greatness and the handsome fortunes of the oil industry in most of
the four decades which followed the war.
There were many, both inside and outside the company, who agreed that this
was indeed the necessary and urgent focus for BP. It had spent its way
foolishly into copper, coal and some other non-oil businesses in the 1970s,
until Mr Horton's predecessor Sir Peter Walters had, with Mr Horton's close
support, forced BP to lurch back to base.
The BP Mr Horton inherited in 1990 was built around oil exploration, oil
refining, chemicals and animal feeds. Since then BP has indicated its
willingness to sell the feeds business and would probably, in the unlikely
eventuality of there being a bidder, pull back in chemicals too.
But essentially, Mr Horton was able to take the view that the big sectoral
adjustments had been made. What he said he wanted was a company capable of
responding more sharply and flexibly to the marketing challenges in
downstream oil and chemicals and executives more capable of delivering that
most elusive but indispensable of oil company assets: the ability to find
oil.
As it has turned out, all of this has taken place against the background of
weak demand, anaemic oil prices and high real interest rates. These were
particularly onerous because BP's debt has risen steeply - partly because,
just before Mr Horton took over, it bought back shares which the Kuwait
Investment Office had acquired in 1987 when the UK government's sale of its
BP stake coincided with the stock market crash.
It has been against this trying background that Mr Horton has launched
Project 1990 and tried to make it work.
Project 1990 was spurred by a questionnaire sent to 150 top managers in 1989
and later to 4,000 lower-level employees. It revealed widespread ignorance
of BP's strategy and some fierce criticism of the multi-tiered committee and
review system, which many felt institutionalised second-guessing in a
damaging way. BP head office alone had 86 committees. Mr Horton told his
colleagues: 'You have one principal task - remove them] If in doubt,
eliminate.'
The executive power of the old divisional managing directors was to be shorn
away and the corporate centre scaled back from 540 people to 380. BP's
payroll, down from 128,000 to 115,000 between 1988 and 1991, would shrink
further.
At the same time the company would concentrate on fewer geographical
groupings, building 'a truly transnational corporation', he told his first
shareholders' meeting. 'People will be expected to take decisions themselves
rather than through committees.
All of this was accompanied by a proclamation of values, such as 'openness,
care, teamwork, empowerment and trust'. Sceptics charged that Mr Horton had
merely swallowed the avant-garde manager's dictionary. Others argued that he
was bringing the latest business school thinking to bear on the toughest
kind of management problem.
It was an expensive programme - thought to have cost more than Pounds 20m -
with its workshops, communications and training programmes and transformed
view of 'human resource' management in the company. The theory was that
information would flow, managers would feel compelled to 'own' problems and
be 'empowered' to do something about them. BP summed up the aim as: 'to cut
the cost of complexity'.
Inevitably, an attack on corporate baronies, revised job descriptions and
job losses produced resistance and bitterness. This reflected itself in an
outbreak of samizdat anti-Horton satire within the company, of a kind
familiar to other bureaucracies facing rapid and unwelcome change.
Last December, the FT profiled Mr Horton in his new office in BP's
splendidly refurbished headquarters. Before long, photocopies of the
article, with completely rewritten text, were circulating. 'The centrepiece
is a huge chair' it said, 'raised on a stepped platform. Horton greets me
and motions me to a seat on one of the lowers steps. 'I designed it myself.
It's modelled on Napoleon's throne.''
Before that, an un-named senior executive had expressed doubts about whether
the autocratic and quick-tempered Mr Horton himself could live by the value
system he had proclaimed. 'Do we really think Bob is going to stop
second-guessing his top colleagues? That's the only way all this change will
work.'
Or to quote another executive: 'The character of the man is to direct
strongly - he instinctively wants to be seen as hands-on. But he also wants
to be seen as an innovative leader.'
The word from the palace revolutionaries yesterday was that Project 1990 and
the trek towards a new culture continues. BP has decided that Mr Horton was
part of the problem, not part of the solution.

FT  26 JUN 92 / 'Unanimity' on need for change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BP directors who confronted Robert Horton earlier this week were
'unanimous' about the need for top level changes in the way the group was
run, according to Lord Ashburton, BP's new chairman.
This shows the depth of concern among Mr Horton's 16 boardroom colleagues,
who include top names from the business and government worlds.
Lord Ashburton himself, better known by his pre-peerage name of Sir John
Baring, is a former head of Barings, the UK's oldest merchant bank, and one
of the most experienced City hands. Sir Patrick Sheehy, chairman of BAT, and
Dr Carl Hahn, chairman of Volkswagen, are members, as is Peter Sutherland,
the Irish former EC Commissioner who is now chairman of Allied Irish Banks.
BP also recently acquired its first female board member, Ms Karen Horn,
chairman and chief executive of Banc One, the banking group in Cleveland,
Ohio, where BP's US operations are based.
The non-business side is represented by Sir James Glover, the former
commander in chief of the UK land forces, and Sir Patrick Wright, permanent
under secretary at the foreign office until his retirement last year.
But though the non-executives hold a 9-8 majority on the board, the
executive directors are a powerful - and growing - force. Only four months
ago, their number was increased from seven to eight so that all the
divisional heads should have board seats.
The senior of these is Mr Hugh Norton, head of the Far East division who
rose to the board in 1989. Subsequent additions were Mr Ray Knowland, head
of BP's chemicals and nutrition divisions, Mr Rodney Chase, head of the US
operations, Mr Russell Seal, chief executive of BP Oil, John Browne, head of
BP Exploration, and Mr Stephen Ahearne, the chief financial officer.
Although the divisional chiefs were all publicly loyal to Mr Horton, many of
BP's greatest internal strains lay at their level: they faced the full force
of Mr Horton's personality, they had to bear and implement the tough cuts of
the last year to get BP's finances straight.
Mr David Simon, the former chief operating officer who now becomes chief
executive, stressed last night that there were to be no major corporate
changes. He is expected to adopt a more collegial style which should soothe
chafed sensibilities.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Career-long rival Simon will show softer touch
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
IN THE early 1980s, as BP was reorganised under the chairmanship of Sir
Peter Walters, David Simon tackled the losses and oversupply of BP's
refinery division. At the same time, Bob Horton was making similarly
difficult decisions at BP Chemicals.
By 1986, 25 years after joining the company, Mr Simon became BP's second
youngest group managing director. The youngest, by three weeks, was Mr
Horton.
Both were tipped to succeed Sir Peter. Mr Horton won the job in 1990, only
to lose it yesterday.
As chief operating officer and vice-chairman from 1990, Mr Simon has been in
charge of day-to-day operations while Mr Horton has concentrated on
strategy. Relations between the two have been poor, culminating in rumours
of a board room split which began earlier this year.
Mr Horton claimed public credit for the sweeping management changes at BP,
but Mr Simon is thought to have played an equally leading role in the
company's redundancy programme.
He has a reputation for being shrewd but understated. He was a Christ's
Hospital scholar, a modern linguist at Cambridge and received an MBA from
Insead, the French management school. Compared to Mr Horton, he is thought
rather bland.
He has also expressed different views about BP's future direction. While Mr
Horton emphasised that BP could go it alone, Mr Simon saw more of a role for
'strategic alliances', such as that formed last year with Statoil of Norway.
The initiative for the link-up grew from the friendship between Mr Simon and
Mr Harald Norvik, Statoil's chairman.
On the future for the oil industry, Mr Simon has taken a more conservative
view on oil prices, although some observers say it is difficult to gauge his
views. It seems likely BP will test projects more carefully and resist those
which rely on a higher oil price.
Mr Simon has been heavily involved in the oil and financial sides of BP's
business, although his early experience was in marketing. He has
concentrated his attentions on Europe, and speaks several European
languages.
Colleagues describe him as quick witted with a dry sense of humour. He is
very keen on golf and reading and once described his favourite pastime as
'watching the sun go down at Hampstead cricket club'.

FT  26 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: BPB Industries
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
There has been a two way pull in BPB's shares recently - but by yesterday
evening it was advantage to the bulls. In abnormally heavy trading the price
jumped 6 per cent as investors reacted to a maintained, albeit only half
covered dividend, and a relatively upbeat recovery statement from the new
chief executive.
BPB has been guilty of unfounded optimism before - so the market is showing
a touching faith in believing that the worst is really now over. True,
Europe's big three producers cannot indefinitely slug it out with each other
in a quest for bigger shares, and neither Knauf nor Lafarge-Coppee will have
been making much money out of gypsum at recent prices. That said, one has to
wonder whether this year's price increases - 10 to 15 per cent in France and
Germany and 8 per cent in the UK - can really be made to stick. The
prospects are brightest in Germany where at least there ought to be some
boost to volumes in 1992. In France and the UK, however, it is hard to see
the industry's financially stretched contracting customers taking any new
price discipline lying down. Even a well established building material
oligopoly like the UK cement producers are finding margins under pressure
again.
The range of current year profit expectations - take your pick between
Pounds 45m to Pounds 70m - reflects the uncertainty. The question is whether
an 8.5 per cent yield adequately reflects the risks if the bulls turn out to
be wrong.

FT  26 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: Wellcome
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
You would hardly expect Wellcome's advisers to be other than brimming with
confidence at this stage. But the reality is that they face quite a struggle
to sell the 330m shares which the company's majority shareholder announced
yesterday it is provisionally planning to give up. The difference with the
GPA issue is that this one looks reasonably well anchored in London, and can
be priced against the secondary market. The similarity is that there may not
be ecstatic response on Wall Street.
That could always change with the roadshows, of course, or a reverse in
investor sentiment in the next month. But for the moment US institutions
seem tired of reading prospectuses - they have been bombarded with initial
public offerings this year - and have lost some of their earlier certainty
that pharmaceutical stocks would continue to outperform. To be fair,
Wellcome's share price has fallen from Pounds 11.25p at the time the
international offering was announced to 915p last night, while the size of
the offer has now been scaled down. But only the next few weeks will tell
whether this is enough to assuage the doubters.
Wellcome wins countless plaudits for good management, and has effected the
change from uncommercial research establishment to marketing led
multinational with considerable success. The challenge will be persuading US
investors that the R &amp; D pipeline is sufficient to maintain strong profits
growth in the late 1990s when patents from its current world beaters will
run out.

FT  26 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: TSB
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Since TSB's loan book fell by 4 per cent during the first six months of its
current financial year, one wonders why it is suddenly going to such great
lengths to attract new retail deposits. The emphasis on high yield retail
deposits has brought in an extra Pounds 1.4bn during the period, but the
bank admits that its lending margin has been squeezed and that this will
continue. Its claim that the price is worth paying to secure new customers
looks a touch dubious. So is its notion that aggressive competition for
retail deposits has become an issue for the industry as a whole.
There is a difference between paying interest on current accounts to keep
the deposit base stable and actively encouraging customers to switch to
higher yielding instruments, which is what TSB now seems to be doing. A
possible interpretation is that the bank is seeking new clients for its
insurance products. Life and pension premiums show some signs of stagnating.
But if that is the motive, the prospects of success seem uncertain at best.
If it is not, then it is hard to see how the strategy will enhance income
which ought to be TSB's overriding priority.
The pre-tax line may show a swing from loss of Pounds 150m to profit of
Pounds 92m between the first halves of last year and this, but only because
of the declining charge for bad and doubtful debts. Operating income is
barely changed. Until TSB can alter that its future looks pretty pedestrian,
even though Hill Samuel now appears to be through the worst.

FT  26 JUN 92 / The Lex Column: BP's black day
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr Robert Horton, until yesterday BP's chairman, is indeed blessed with a
good brain, as he told Forbes magazine in February. But it was not
sufficient to square the impossible circle of maintaining a dividend payment
costing over Pounds 900m. Earnings this year are unlikely to be much more
than half that and, on some estimates, cash is draining away at an annual
rate of over Pounds 1bn before disposals. His resignation means the dividend
cut from this quarter on is almost inevitable.
The question is what level would be sustainable. In the short run there
would be an argument for omitting the payment altogether. The resources to
pay for it are only being found by slimming the company through disposals
and cutbacks on capital spending. The slightly longer run view is not
necessarily that dire. BP's earnings are currently depressed by heavy
restructuring costs as well as weak refining margins and chemicals markets.
In more normal circumstances, it could expect to post around Pounds 1bn a
year in earnings, even with an oil price of Dollars 20 a barrel. A halved
dividend would then be comfortably covered about twice.
The initial New York market response to last night's announcement was that a
halved dividend is broadly what the market anticipates. The price there of
about 210p - 33p below the London close - would imply a yield of somewhat
over 5 per cent, close to that of Shell. The company was being pretty cagey
last night, however, and the immediate uncertainty is likely to prevent
yield funds climbing back in quickly at lower levels. The trouble is that if
BP is in for a rough ride, then so is the market as a whole.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Bomb explodes outside City bank
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TERRORIST bombers hit the City of London last night, disrupting travel but
causing no injuries.
The bomb went off just before 8pm outside the London headquarters of the
Chase Manhattan Bank in Woolgate House, Coleman Street, off Moorgate. It had
been left in a briefcase under a white Mercedes car.
City of London police were alerted by a security guard who noticed the
suspect briefcase and dialled 999 about five minutes before the bomb went
off.
They were clearing the area and about to search for the device when it
exploded.
Windows were blown out of Woolgate House and an nearby car was damaged, but
there were no injuries. The bomb was believed to contain about 2lbs of high
explosive.
Commander Hugh Moore of the City of London Police said the latest attack
bore the hallmarks of the IRA.
It was also typical of latest IRA diversionary tactics to accompany
explosions with hoax calls.
About 10 minutes after the explosion, a man with an Irish accent telephoned
the BBC claiming to be an IRA member and using a known code and saying where
the bomb had been placed.
The caller said four other bombs had been planted in central London and were
timed to go off 15 minutes later, but police did not find any other devices.
Many streets in the City of London were sealed off for several hours to
ensure that no other devices had been left. There was also disruption at
other locations, including King's Cross, as searches were made.
One Barbican resident said: 'The explosion was incredibly loud and
spectacular and sent a plume of black smoke 300 yards into the air.'
It appeared to have caused little damage to surrounding buildings.
Ten weeks ago the IRA bombed the Baltic Exchange in the City, killing three
people, injuring 91, and causing millions of pounds worth of damage.

<TEXT>
INTERNATIONAL military intervention in Bosnia may be considered by the
United Nations Security Council within the next week, if ceasefires in the
region continue to break down.
European Community heads of government meeting in Lisbon today are also
expected to express their willingness in principle to support intervention.
The five permanent Security Council members have been holding intense
consultations over the last few days on stepping up sanctions against
Serbia.
It is widely expected that, within the next week, the council will be asked
to approve a resolution which could even go as far as providing for
international military intervention in Bosnia.
At talks in London between Mr Edward Perkins, US ambassador to the UN, and
senior Foreign Office officials, there was general agreement on the need for
urgent action to stop the slaughter of civilians in Bosnia and to allow
Sarajevo airport to be opened to humanitarian supplies.
Whether such action would include the use of military force remains to be
decided. But Mr James Baker, US secretary of state, said this week the US
had not ruled out participation in 'some multilateral operation'.
Since then, officials say the 'permanent five' have talked in terms of
military intervention if Serb militias continue to obstruct UN relief
operations in Sarajevo and to stop relief passing through the city's
airport.
The nine-nation Western European Union might be among organisations called
upon by the UN to supply military forces for the region. A newly constituted
ad hoc group of WEU foreign and defence ministry officials is due to meet in
London today to discuss contingency plans for the dispatch of joint military
units to flash-points such as Yugoslavia.
WEU ministers agreed in Bonn last week to give the organisation a genuine
military capacity, which would enable it to take part in international
operations.
However, member countries made clear in their so-called 'Petersberg
Declaration' that they would participate in peacekeeping activities only at
the request of other international organisations such as the UN.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Navy boards French boat after 'unprovoked attack'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD EVANS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROYAL NAVY officers yesterday boarded a French fishing boat off the Isles of
Scilly following an 'unprovoked attack' by French trawlermen on Cornish
boats over disputed fishing rights.
Mr David Curry, fisheries minister, told the Commons there had been a
'violent and outrageous' incident, and the UK government intended to bring
sustained pressure on the French authorities 'to make sure their vessels are
brought to book'.
The incident, one of several in recent months as a new bilateral fishing
agreement is being drawn up, has created anger among the Cornish fishing
community and some MPs, but it might not develop into a full-scale
diplomatic row.
The UK government, while taking a tough line, clearly does not wish to see
unnecessary friction with France as it takes over the European Community
presidency, and the French authorities were conciliatory.
Mr Curry said Mr Charles Josselin, French secretary of state for the sea
with responsibility for the fishing industry, had 'vigorously condemned' the
behaviour of the French boats, and had pledged a full investigation followed
by firm action should the allegations be confirmed.
HMS Brecon, a minehunter and fisheries protection vessel, was sent to the
scene, 16 miles north of the Scilly Isles, following a dispute involving
three small boats from Newlyn in Cornwall and two larger French vessels from
Concarneau in Brittany.
The Cornish vessels alleged that the French deliberately ploughed through
their nets and when the St Uny, one of the Newlyn boats, approached one of
the French vessels, the Larche, to advise it on the position of its nets, it
was pelted with pieces of metal and chain.
A second incident was also reported to have taken place between the Larche
and the St Uny. No one was hurt in either incident, although several
thousand pounds of damage was said to have been done to the Cornish boats'
nets.
Officers from HMS Brecon later boarded the Larche, with the permission of
its skipper, to seek further information about the incidents. They also
planned to board the St Uny and to remain on patrol to prevent any further
confrontation.
The clashes are the culmination of incidents going back several years.
Fishermen's groups from Britain and France are on the point of agreeing
fishing rights beyond the six-mile territorial limit. The area where the
incidents took place is being divided into 'boxes' to prevent such clashes
happening, but details have yet to be finalised.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Major challenges Tory rebels on support for Delors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP STEPHENS, Political Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR JOHN Major openly challenged his party's Euro-sceptics yesterday as he
confirmed his backing for a two-year extension to Mr Jacques Delors' term as
president of the European Commission.
The decision, endorsed by the cabinet before Mr Major flew to Lisbon for
today's European Community summit, was followed by a pledge from the prime
minister that the government intended to ratify the Maastricht treaty. But
in an attempt to isolate the Euro-sceptics, ministers emphasised again that
the government would use its forthcoming six-month presidency of the EC to
rein back the Commission's powers.
Mr Tristan Garel-Jones, the Foreign Office minister responsible for Europe,
said that the priority of the presidency would be to give substance to the
concept of 'subsidiarity' - the devolution of authority back from Brussels
to national governments.
Mr Major's intention at the two-day Lisbon summit is to press for a
declaration giving the Commission and the presidency a mandate for that
goal. He will also seek a commitment from EC leaders to finalise over the
next six months a negotiating stance with the European Free Trade
Association countries on their applications for EC membership.
Displaying visible irritation with recent attacks on Maastricht from rebel
Tory MPs, Mr Major told the House of Commons that he had no intention of
'compromising' Maastricht on political and monetary union.
He reminded the Euro-sceptics they had been elected on a manifesto pledge to
implement the treaty: 'I have no intention of breaking the word of the
British government . . . Neither do I have any intention of compromising
what we agreed on that occasion and wrecking this country's reputation for
plain dealing, honest dealing and good faith.'
The rebels insisted that they were intent on wrecking the legislation needed
to ratify the treaty when it returned to the Commons later this year.
Mr John Smith, the prospective Labour leader, has said the opposition is
likely to back the Tory rebels' attempts to prolong indefinitely debate on
the legislation.
Downing Street said that the decision to back a two-year extension of Mr
Delors' term came after a brief cabinet discussion. Ministers agreed
opposition to Mr Delors would have been what one minister called a 'futile
gesture'.

FT  26 JUN 92 / A high-stakes claim to France's political prize: President
Mitterrand's campaign to ratify the Maastricht Treaty is confounding his
conservative opponents
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IAN DAVIDSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The constitutional revision passed this week by the French parliament is an
important boost for President Mitterrand, but it is also much more than
that: it is a turning point on which he will be staking his presidency.
It is a boost in two senses. In the first place, it is a decisive step
towards the French ratification of the Maastricht Treaty. If ratification
gets through the referendum scheduled for the autumn, and if the Danish
problem is sorted out, President Mitterrand can claim an appropriately grand
achievement to crown his long political career.
At the same time, his campaign for Maastricht is proving a diabolically
effective device for wrong-footing his political opponents. Over the past
year, the conservative parties have become increasingly confident that they
will reverse their defeat of 1988, and win a smashing victory in the general
elections next March. The Maastricht debate seriously threatens this
confidence, because it strikes them where they are most divided and
therefore most vulnerable.
The centre-right UDF group and the Centrist party are wholeheartedly
committed to European integration and the Maastricht Treaty; but their
Gaullist allies are internally divided, between those who are at best
ambivalent about the treaty, and those who are completely hostile.
This division between the Gaullists and their partners has already become a
source of disagreement. It is bound to become more intense as France moves
from the phase of constitutional revision to the phase of ratification. If
it should turn into an open quarrel, as it may well do before the
ratification process is over, it could even prejudice the parties' ability
to work successfully together in the general election campaign.
These conservative divisions, and the near-certainty that they will get
deeper, must seem a sweet revenge for President Mitterrand. For more than a
year, ever since his calamitous appointment of Mrs Edith Cresson as prime
minister, he has been in the doldrums in the opinion polls. Her replacement
by Mr Pierre Beregovoy, the former finance minister, last April has given
the government a vital shot of optimism; but President Mitterrand himself is
still rock bottom in public opinion.
A year ago, the morale of the regime was so low that some people predicted
that President Mitterrand might be forced to resign before the end of his
term.
Yet his character made it more likely, even then, that he would not give up
without a fight, and that he would seek the high political ground to do so.
Maastricht offers this high ground. And with characteristic shrewdness, Mr
Mitterrand has organised the procedure and the timetable to exploit the
weakness of his opponents to the full.
By forcing the constitutional revision through the parliamentary procedure,
he has driven the conservative parties to display their widening divergences
before the public. The Gaullists have accused their ostensible partners in
the UDF and Centrist parties of 'collaboration' with the government.
The centre-right have retorted in kind, warning that they could not vote
with the Gaullists in a future election, and might even campaign against
them, if they were to vote against ratification of the Maastricht Treaty.
There is little doubt that Mr Jacques Chirac, the Gaullist leader, hopes
eventually to declare in favour of Maastricht. He still harbours
presidential ambitions; he knows that an anti-European label might make him
unelectable; in any case, it would be an impossible handicap if he were
elected. Yet he has not been able to impose this logic on his party.
On the contrary, his des-perate efforts to contain the Gaullists' internal
divisions have made it easier for the anti-Europeans to drive the party ever
closer to an anti-Maastricht position.
Last week the Gaullists abstained on the revision of the constitution in the
National Assembly, but voted against it in the Senate. This week they
declined to take part in the proceedings in the joint Congress in
Versailles, on the grounds that the the treaty was null and void, as a
result of the Danish 'no' vote.
Since the Danish problem almost certainly cannot be resolved before
September, this logic ought to require the Gaullists to vote against the
treaty in the French referendum. But Mr Jacques Toubon, the former
secretary-general of the party, has said that he was opposed to the
constitutional revision, but was in favour of the ratification of the
treaty. This is a position which it must be quite difficult to explain.
The Gaullists' dilemma has raised new questions about the balance of forces
between the conservative parties. In the pre-Maastricht era the Gaullists,
as a single party, were more disciplined and therefore stronger than the
somewhat diverse assemblage of Liberal and Christian-Democrat parties.
Today, it is the UDF and the Centrists which feel stronger and more united.
This is partly because they have no difficulty over the revision of the
constitution, but also because they have managed at the same time to impose
substantive amendments which the government was reluctant to concede.
Some commentators have concluded that the Maastricht debate is opening up
the possibility of a sweeping reversal of political alliances; by the time
the ratification struggle is over, the conservative alliance will be dead
and gone, but the ground will have been prepared for a new pro-European
alliance between the Socialists and at least parts of the centre-right.
Such a recomposition of the political scenery seems rather unlikely, at any
rate before the general election. The Socialists are probably too
contaminated as election partners, and public opinion is clearly poised for
a conservative alternative. On the other hand, the final fate of the
Maastricht Treaty may well not be resolved before next spring, in which case
the European quarrel between the conservative parties will also be alive
during the general election.
All this must be deeply satisfying to such a consummate political
manipulator as President Mitterrand. The Gaullist party is impaled on its
nationalist reflexes, and Mr Chirac is in the process of confirming that he
is not in strategic control of his party. For the moment the odds must still
be heavily in favour of a large conservative victory in the next general
election, but the Europe factor may shorten them dramatically.
Such calculations leave out the Mitterrand factor, however. French public
opinion has long been in favour of Europe, and the polls show a constant
margin of popular support for the Maastricht Treaty. But unless there is a
recovery in the president's personal popularity, there is a clear danger
that the electorate will decide on the day to vote against Mr Mitterrand,
rather than in favour of Maastricht.
It is in this sense that Mr Mitterrand is staking his presidency in his
Maastricht campaign. For if the Maastricht referendum were to fail, there is
little doubt that he would be morally obliged to resign. The poetic paradox
in the drama is that Mr Chirac may be able to maximise the chances of
President Mitterrand's resignation, by campaigning against the Maastricht
Treaty; but only at the price of reducing his own chances of being elected
in his place.

If EC eminences at today's European summit see Danish foreign minister Uffe

Ellemann-Jensen, an ardent soccer fan, is taking a pocket-sized TV set with

Denmark and Germany. 'I'm quite sure Helmut Kohl, who'll be sitting next to

If Halifax - 'the biggest and getting bigger' building society - really
means to break with its past and look beyond its own ranks for its next
chief executive, there'll certainly be no shortage of candidates.
The upper echelons of NatWest and Midland are littered with executives who
have been passed over for promotion, and so would relish a go at running a
retail banking business which is over twice as big as the TSB.
Even so, the last thing the Halifax needs is a dull and boring clearing
banker running the works. Apart from Lloyds Bank's Brian Pitman, very few of
same can pass muster as good at both banking and managing. Far better to
emulate Abbey National by recruiting a complete newcomer, as it did in Peter
Birch, a former managing director of the UK end of Gillette.
Whether the Halifax will actually do so is another question. It hates its
reputation for watching what Abbey does, then following suit after a decent
interval.

Embarrassment all round at Switzerland Inc at the unveiling of a huge new

The 8ft-square clock, seen by 300,000 people a day, sports the bright red
logo of Citizen, Japan's leading watch-maker. More galling still, the clock
itself is Swiss, being made by Zurich's own Theodor Beyer. Citizen simply
beat its Swiss competitors to claim the choice advertising space.
The country's Federal Railways, which sold the space, protests its
innocence. It offered the opportunity to all watch-makers, but the Japanese
company was the only one to jump.
Citizen was delighted to have the chance to outsmart its leading Swiss rival
SMH, producer of the phenomenally successful Swatch. which has been making
life miserable for its Japanese competitors on several fronts. It has even
undercut them on sales of watch parts in Hong Kong.
Even so, the Swiss contingent will have the home defeat staring them in the
face for a good while yet. Citizen's contract runs until 1996, with an
optional further three years.

There is more than a touch of irony about the fact that the very day Sir
Peter Walters's Midland Bank jumps into bed with its Hong Kong suitor, Sir
Peter's other great scheme - his own carefully laid succession plan at BP -
goes off with a loud bang.
Whilst attention will be rightly focused on the reasons for Bob Horton's
early departure - which may have as much to do with his personality as with
his strategy - it should not be forgotten that he has only been doing the
job for just over two years. Most of BP's problems are not of his making.
By comparison, Walters's tenure at the top of the group was always felt to
have been a success. This may have to be reviewed. After all, the mark of a
great company chairman is being able to pick the right successor.
When Horton beat David Simon in the race for the top seat, there was some
surprise that BP had opted for the prickly trouble-shooter over his smoother
rival. Walters must shoulder some of the blame for making the wrong choice.
What a contrast it all makes with the Royal Dutch Shell group which quietly
changes its boss next Wednesday. Hands up, anyone who can name him.

FT  26 JUN 92 / A Wellcome on the doormat: Paul Abrahams examines the issue
of shares in the UK pharmaceuticals group
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL ABRAHAMS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Mr John Robb, chief executive of Wellcome, the pharmaceuticals company, will
pack his bags today and head for his native Scotland. Edinburgh will be his
first stop on a round-the-world road show, taking in more than 16 cities
from San Francisco to Osaka. On his travels he aims to promote the sale of
at least 330m shares worth about Pounds 3bn.
Mr Lawrence Banks, head of corporate finance at Robert Fleming, the adviser
to Wellcome Trust, the charity which currently holds 73.5 per cent of
Wellcome, was optimistic about the offer yesterday. 'We have been pleased
with the level of interest both in the UK and internationally in this
first-rate pharmaceuticals company,' he said.
In spite of Mr Banks's rhetoric, the issue's success hangs in the balance.
Following last week's aborted flotation of GPA, the aircraft-leasing group,
the outlook for new issues has clouded over. The prospects for
pharmaceuticals groups are uncertain. Between 1985 and 1990 the world drugs
market grew on average by 13 per cent a year; industry forecasts put the
1990-95 figure at 9 per cent; the five years after that could see as little
as 5 per cent average growth.
Last autumn, when preparations for Wellcome's offer began, Mr Robb's sales
task appeared easier. Pharmaceuticals shares were star performers on global
markets. Between January 1990 and December 1991, British healthcare stocks,
driven by American buying, outperformed the UK market by 65 per cent. Over
the same period, American drugs stocks outstripped the US market by 55 per
cent.
The reasons were clear. Ageing populations in developed countries ensured
that demand for drugs continued to grow even during recession. That
guaranteed earnings growth far in excess of that experienced by other
sectors.
But drugs stocks have now fallen from grace. Since January, US
pharmaceuticals shares have underperformed the market by nearly 20 per cent.
American investors, noting the apparent upturn in the US economy, have
switched from recession-proof stocks into those that perform better during
recovery. Wellcome has seen a similar shift in the UK. Its shares have
fallen from Pounds 11.26 before the issue was announced on March 2 to 914p
yesterday.
Investors' enthusiasm has also been dampened by the increasingly hostile
environment for drugs companies. Costs associated with the research,
development and marketing of drugs are rising fast because drugs must go
through expensive licensing procedures in individual countries at the same
time. Meanwhile revenues are threatened by worldwide downward pressure on
drugs prices as governments struggle to contain ever-growing health
expenditure.
Pharmaceuticals earnings have started to suffer. Some US groups had
disappointing first-quarter results this year. Shares in Bristol-Myers
Squibb, the world's third-largest drugs company, fell 10 per cent on June 2
after it warned that sales growth for the second quarter would be less than
5 per cent.
Against this difficult background Mr Robb must set out his case. First, he
must convince doubting audiences that he has adopted the right strategy for
Wellcome to escape the twin pressures of rising costs and falling prices;
and he must answer misgivings about any perceived company weaknesses.
The most crucial part of his tour will start next Friday when Mr Robb starts
his US campaign. At least 80m shares, worth at present about Dollars 1.3bn,
have been slated for American investors. Morgan Stanley, the US investment
bank advising Wellcome, will be charged with the successful selling of such
a large volume.
Although the issue is only half of the US's largest public stock offer last
month, when General Motors raised Dollars 2.14bn, the British company is not
widely known in north America. Only 2 per cent of its stock is owned in the
US, compared with about 26 per cent of Glaxo, the UK pharmaceuticals group,
and about 32 per cent of SmithKline Beecham, the Anglo-American company.
Another problem for Mr Robb's US campaign is that Wellcome's price-earnings
ratio is slightly higher than that of Merck, the world's largest drug
company and last year one of US investors' favourite stocks.
Mr Steve Plag, pharmaceuticals analyst at County Natwest, the only important
UK broker not directly involved in the issue, explained: 'On my calculations
Wellcome is on a prospective price-earnings ratio of 22, whereas Merck is on
20 and Glaxo is on 18. The question is whether US investors will be willing
to buy a stock on a higher ratio than Merck.'
Nevertheless, Mr Robb can point to several factors in his company's favour.
Wellcome is the fastest-growing of the world's 20 largest pharmaceutical
companies. Over the past five years it has enjoyed the highest average
annual earnings-per-share growth rate of any big pharmaceutical company -
some 30.3 per cent compared with 17.6 per cent for Glaxo and 15.7 per cent
for SmithKline Beecham.
In the short term, in spite of difficult conditions, Wellcome's earnings
growth looks assured. S G Warburg, the company's broker, forecast in its
most recent circular that sales from continuing operations are set to grow
at 16 per cent a year over the next three years. Meanwhile operating profit
margins over the same period should increase from 24.6 per cent to 29 per
cent.
The strongest card in Mr Robb's hand is the company's ability to withstand
pricing pressures. During the past six months, sales increased 21 per cent
over the same period of 1991. But only 3 percentage points came from price
increases. The rest was generated by volume growth.
'There's little disagreement that Robb and his new management team have done
an excellent job and that earnings growth looks strong for the next two
years,' said Mr Plag. 'The problem is what happens beyond that. There is a
significant risk that earnings growth may start to decelerate.'
Mr Plag claimed that the two main motors for earnings growth - the company's
sales of less profitable subsidiaries, and Zovirax, the anti-viral treatment
 -will start running out of steam soon.
Unusually for such an 11-year-old product, Zovirax's sales are still growing
fast. But growth is likely to slow in the mid-1990s despite Wellcome's
acquisition of licences around the world for Zovirax to treat diseases such
as chicken-pox and shingles. The drug's patents expire in Germany in 1993,
followed by the UK in 1995 and the US - where 39 per cent of sales are made
 -in 1997.
The patent expiries could be significant because much of Wellcome's growth
derives from Zovirax. Mr Plag estimates the product could account for more
than 40 per cent of sales growth next year.
For long-term prosperity Wellcome is dependent upon the development of new
products to replace existing earners. The company's strong research base is
clearly crucial, and Mr Robb says R&amp;D investment will remain at about 14 per
cent of sales for the foreseeable future.
Since joining the company from Beecham, where he was consumer products
executive, in 1989, Mr Robb has tried to integrate R&amp;D more closely into the
marketing effort. Symbolically, the group marketing operations have been
moved to the Beckenham R&amp;D site, providing far closer co-operation between
the two divisions.
'Marketing is terribly important,' he said. 'We used to think if we got the
research and development right the products would sell themselves. We have
to market ourselves aggressively.'
Rather than building up expensive marketing networks, however, the group is
turning to co-marketing agreements with other companies. It has initialled
deals with Hoechst in Germany, Sigma Tau in Italy and Sumitomo in Japan to
help market Zovirax.
Last spring the company conducted the most thorough review of its R&amp;D
projects it had undertaken. Its aim was to avoid research on scientifically
interesting but commercially fruitless compounds. As a result, numerous
products were dropped, leaving resources for fewer but potentially more
lucrative drugs, such as Atovaquone, Wellcome's medicine for Aids-related
pneumonia.
Mr Robb has also moved to set up clinical trials simultaneously in Japan,
Europe and the US for Wellcome's new herpes treatment, known as 256.
Previously such trials were carried out consecutively, leading to long gaps
between approval in each market. Project teams have been established to
anticipate potential delays with the regulatory authorities. Mr Robb's hope
is that 256 could be rolled out into the world's three largest market's -
the US, Japan and Europe - within 72 months. It took 11 years to obtain all
Zovirax's licences.
In spite of Mr Robb's efforts, weaknesses remain. Wellcome's corporate tax
rate, for example, is relatively high because it has not moved parts of its
manufacturing base to countries such as Singapore and Puerto Rico, which
have liberal tax regimes. The group pays 36.5 per cent of its profits in
tax, in contrast to Glaxo's 28 per cent and Merck's 26 per cent. S G Warburg
said in its circular that it expects Wellcome's tax burden to increase by 1
percentage point this year.
Another concern is Retrovir, Wellcome's anti-HIV drug. Its patent is being
challenged by Barr Laboratories, a US generics group which is seeking to
market its own version of the drug.
'Wellcome's case is technically strong, but the case will be decided by a
North Carolina jury next year,' said Mr Plag at County Natwest. 'Both
Retrovir and Aids are emotive issues and the outcome is by no means certain.
If Wellcome loses, the group's earnings growth could fall significantly
after 1994.' Although the drug has a high name recognition, it represents
only 14 per cent of group sales.
Robert Fleming's Mr Banks will have to wait until July 24 when the offer
closes to see whether his optimism is justified. As Mr Robb jets round the
world his marketing skills are likely to be much in demand. Despite the
questions surrounding Wellcome's long-term growth, they are likely to ensure
the issue succeeds.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Arts: Women's view of Weimar - Fine Arts
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PATRICIA MORISON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
An excess of candour can be bad for one's health. Be sure, then, that there
is a reason why your reviewer will admit that she previously knew the work
of only one artist, Kathe Kollwitz, in the major exhibition of German art in
the 1920s and '30s now at the Leicestershire City Museum and Art Gallery.
Largely made up of loans from German museums and private collections,
Domesticity and Dissent is a highly unusual exhibition. It features prints,
paintings, photographs and sculptures by no less than 26 artists associated
with Neue Sachlichkeit, or New Objectivity - the realist movement dominated
by the figures of George Grosz and Otto Dix.
No one interested in art and society in the Weimar Republic should miss
Domesticity and Dissent. Two individuals deserve credit for making this
ambitious venture succeed - which is not to overlook a bold first step into
sponsorship by Hormann UK Ltd, who make garage doors. The idea for the
exhibition was put up by Marsha Meskimmon, an American postgraduate student.
Leicester is already well-known for its collection of early 20th-century
German art, and Meskimmon found a ready supporter in Amanda Wadsley, the
museum's fine arts curator.
Meskimmon wrote hundreds of letters to German museums and collectors, then
went dredging through their records and the public archives in search of
information about 26 artists she had selected for the show. Reunification
came a little late in the day, but it certainly helped. Many paintings have
been loaned from museums formerly in the East, hence some atrocious frames
and the poor state of conservation of certain works.
But with Hedwig Huschke, for example, the determined Ms Meskimmon drew a
blank. The public gallery at Weimar has lent two paintings by Huschke; a
view of village-houses near Weimar (1924) and a large, quiet-toned yet
arresting self-portrait (1932). Now in the case of a 15th-century painting,
it is never a surprise to find nothing is known about the artist. A scholar
dubs the artist Master of the Man in Striped Hose, and suddenly he exists.
But in the century marked above all by the Triumph of Bureaucracy, it is a
shock to find an artist's catalogue entry stating 'no biographical
information available.' Huschke existed, but who was she?
By now, of course, attentive readers will have smelt a rat. The subtitle to
the exhibition is 'The Role of Women Artists in Germany 1918-38.' Which, of
course, changes the whole picture and lets me, and I dare say you too, off
the hook.
Small wonder that, except for Kollwitz, none of these women artists was
selected for the Royal Academy's 1985 conspectus show of German 20th-century
art. More tellingly, none of them was shown at the 1978 Arts Council
exhibition which for the first time put Neue Sachlichkeit before the British
public. Gerta Overbeck and the Jewish artist Lea Grundig were merely names
in the text.
So, on one level, the Leicester exhibition is a particularly well-researched
example of feminist art-history managing to salvage women artists from
l'oubli. It is amusing to find that Whitney Chadwick's Women, Art and
Society, published only two years ago and billed as a 'comprehensive'
account of women's involvement in the fine arts, also came up only with
Kollwitz, plus Paula Modersohn-Becker.
One of the best things in Domesticity and Dissent is the self-portrait
bronze made in 1936 when Kollwitz was nearly 70 - the year in which she was
unofficially banned from exhibiting by the Nazis. Obviously it was tempting
to include this great artist who has come to enjoy cult status. However, she
makes an odd member of Neue Sachlichkeit, and what gives Domesticity and
Dissent its cogency is the focus on the contradictions, ironies and
undoubted achievement of these women realists.
Central to the Neue Sachlichkeit tendency was the image of the artist as a
man of unflinching vision, focusing his lens on whatever was banal,
repulsive, cruel. We think, of course, of Grosz and Dix, of their shocking
images of prostitutes and cripples. Many artists of Marxist and anarchist
sympathies wanted to flay bourgeois society in their work, to express
sympathy for the sufferings of the industrialised proletariat.
Traditionally, women artists were expected to prefer domestic images. But in
an era when everyone was talking about the problem of the New Woman, who had
the vote and campaigned for abortion, many women artists naturally embraced
the cause of public 'dissent'. There are images of domesticity. However, it
is a home which is a place of suffering, where poverty is least visible yet
most cruel.
In Lea Grundig's etchings for the 'Women's Life' series, a child is dead, a
mother sits like a prisoner and the streets are for women a place of
exclusion, gazing at consumer goods in shop windows. 'A Children's
Playground at Night' is a place beneath smoking factory chimneys where men
and women make love on the benches: in a Grosz scene, we would know the
women were prostitutes, but here, both sexes are victims.
However, there is a great variety in the work of these artists. Grete
Jurgens's portrait of a little girl represents another facet of Neue
Sachlichkeit, the nostalgia for Bedermeier sweetness. In Eva Schulze-Knabe's
heroic self-portrait, there is conscious defiance of the anti-female
stereotype which kept women - and women-artists - in their place. Other
personal 'discoveries' I earnestly hope to be seeing more of include the
sculptors Lucie Prussog-Jahn and Rene Sintensis, and the painters Gerta
Overbeck and Kate Diehn-Bitt (there is a fascinating neo-Renaissance
self-portrait).
Domesticity and Dissent ends on the July 5. However, I am told there is a
'90 per cent' chance it will transfer to the Kelvingrove Museum and Art
Gallery in Glasgow. I hope so: this is an exhibition after which our view of
German art of the inter-war years ought never to be the same again.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Sir James Stirling: British architect on the world stage -
Obituary
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR JAMES Stirling, the internationally famous architect, died suddenly in
London yesterday. His schemes always showed an extraordinarily inventive
intelligence. His knighthood in the Queen's Birthday Honours two weeks ago
marked his belated recognition in this country as an architectural giant.
The son of a Scottish marine engineer, James Stirling was born in Glasgow in
1926. After war service he completed his architectural training at Liverpool
university, a school then unique in the UK for its open-minded attitude to
modernist ideas. Stirling became a member of the architectural avant-garde;
Le Corbusier's late work was the greatest influence on his early
development.
His first partnership, with James Gowan, resulted in several important and
influential commissions. It was the expanding world of higher education in
the 1960s which proved a mainstay of the practice. With Leicester
University's Engineering Building (1959-63), Stirling won world celebrity.
Critics enthused about the brick and glass tower with glazed workshops. They
pointed to the influence of his passionate interest in Liverpool's 19th
century factories and warehouses.
Practising independently, Stirling built the Cambridge History Faculty
Library (1964-67), which consolidated his reputation as the most original
talent among British architects. (It soon became notorious, and remains to
some extent the rallying point of British anti-modernists.) At the same time
he completed residential buildings at St Andrew's University, and the Florey
building, a student block for Queen's College, Oxford, last of the series of
buildings using engineering brick and industrial glazing.
Stirling joined Michael Wilford to form his second, enduring professional
partnership. The 1970s were lean years, but his reputation outside Britain
continued to grow. Success came with the magnificent new Staatsgallerie in
Stuttgart, the art gallery regarded as the city's architectural jewel.
Important commissions in the US and Germany followed: buildings at Rice
University; Cornell University; the Fogg Museum at Harvard; the Berlin
Science Centre. In the UK, the 1980s at last gave Stirling his long deserved
prominence: commissions for the Clore Gallery at the Tate, built to ex-hibit
the Turner bequest; and the Tate Gallery in Liverpool.
Stirling's death leaves still hanging the tortured question of redevelopment
at No 1, Poultry, in the City of London. Stirling himself was always a
resolutely apolitical architect, never doctrinaire in his approach. In the
profession he was admired as a tireless fighter for the integrity of his
schemes, and as an unpompous, unaffected man - a highly influential teacher
and mentor to a generation of architects. He revelled in his role as 'enfant
terrible'.
Charles Jencks, the architectural historian, has called Stirling 'the most
important architect of his generation'.
UK readers may recall with pleasure a recent series of television
advertisements which featured two young German businessmen discussing (with
English subtitles) the new Rover Sterling car belonging to one of them - a
choice causing some anxiety in the firm. Driving into Stuttgart - home of
Mercedes-Benz - the anxious colleague is clearly impressed by the car's
performance and refinement and, as it pulls up outside the Staatsgallerie,
the driver nods knowingly at both car and building, declaring proudly:
'Britischer Architekt]'

FT  26 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Building societies' tax move
resisted
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By EMMA TUCKER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE GOVERNMENT yesterday pressed ahead with plans to defy attempts by Leeds
Building and other building societies to recover through the courts what
they claims is overpaid tax.
During discussions in the committee stage of the finance bill, Mr Stephen
Dorrell, financial secretary to the Treasury, said the government was unable
to stand by in the face of current court proceedings when the amounts in
question were so high.
The societies say they were taxed twice during the introduction of
composite-rate tax in the late 1980s and are owed Pounds 57m. The
government, instead, contends that the exchequer stands to lose up to Pounds
15bn of tax should the proceedings succeed.
Last year's Finance Bill contained retrospective legislation preventing the
Leeds and other societies from following in the footsteps of the Woolwich,
which had won a similar action. This year's retrospective legislation might
close the door for good on action in the UK courts.
Mr Geoffrey Hoon, the Labour MP for Ashfield, said: 'What is plainly wrong
with this clause is that it seeks to deal retrospectively with a situation
that was all of the government's making.'
MPs rejected an opposition amendment to allow the money to be recovered and
then invested in mortgage rescue schemes.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Ambitious backbenchers chase
committee places
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By IVO DAWNAY, Political Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE BIRTH of a National Heritage select committee, the reincarnation of a
Scottish affairs committee and the much-predicted demise of energy were key
events for ambitious backbenchers in the Commons yesterday.
Tory MPs passed over for office will also have noted the splitting of
education and science into two, with a new science and technology committee
to shadow the eponymous office, controlled by Mr William Waldegrave, the
public services minister.
The changes, announced by Mr Tony Newton, the leader of the Commons, are the
fruit of behind-the-scenes talks with the Opposition and look certain to be
approved when they are debated next Tuesday.
Even before the go-ahead is formally given, backbenchers anxious to
participate in the scrutiny of government departments have been lobbying the
whips and the influential committee of selection for a seat on a favourite
committee.
Most of the committees, now increased by one from 15 to 16, have 11 places,
a quorum of three and the political balance tipped 6-5 in favour of the
government. Whips agree which party should chair which committee and largely
fix the membership. But within that framework the chairmen are selected by
the members themselves.
In the last parliament, Labour held social security under Mr Frank Field,
employment under Mr Ron Leighton, public accounts under Mr Robert Sheldon,
Wales under Mr Gareth Wardell and transport under Mr David Marshall.
The return of Scottish Affairs - shelved by the last government amid fierce
controversy due to the lack of Conservative MPs north of the border - is an
olive branch to the Caledonian fringe.
While its membership has been reduced from 13 to 11, most assume that a
Labour majority will be allowed. Last night both Labour and the Scottish
Nationalists offered heavily qualified welcomes to the committee's return.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Action on drinks competition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PHILIP RAWSTORNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER moves to increase competition in the Pounds 1.3bn carbonated-drinks
market were announced yesterday.
Mr Neil Hamilton, corporate affairs minister, asked Sir Bryan Carsberg,
director-general of fair trading, to secure undertakings from Coca-Cola &amp;
Schweppes Beverages (CCSB) and Britvic, the industry leaders, to end
restrictive or exclusive supply agreements with pubs and other leisure
outlets.
The action follows consultations between the Department of Trade and
Industry and the companies after a Monopolies and Mergers Commission
investigation last year.
The commission found competition was generally effective in the take-home
trade but that CCSB and Britvic practices in the leisure trade could
restrict choice and lead to higher prices.
CCSB was ordered last August to seek government permission for any further
acquisitions of companies involved in the supply of draught soft drinks.
The Coca-Cola/Cadbury Schweppes joint venture has since ended distribution
agreements which the commission found to operate against the public
interest. It will now be asked to undertake not to reintroduce them.
Sir Bryan will also seek undertakings from CCSB, Britvic - which is owned by
Bass, Allied-Lyons, Whitbread and Pepsico - and Coca-Cola Bottlers (Ulster)
to end, and not reintroduce, exclusive supply agreements in the leisure
trade.
Mr Hamilton said that while leisure trade customers with such agreements
could, in certain circumstances, stock competing products, 'the effect of
exclusivity is to limit opportunities for competing suppliers and the
choices available to final consumers'.
CCSB and Britvic said yesterday such undertakings would not adversely affect
their businesses.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Oftel probes cellular market
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MICHIYO NAKAMOTO and DAVID LASCELLES
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
OFTEL, the telecommunications regulator, has launched an investigation into
alleged unfair practices, including the possible abuse of monopoly power, by
leading cellular phone network operators Cellnet and Vodafone.
The investigation follows a complaint by Talkland International, an
independent cellular phone service provider which is 51 per cent owned by
Compagnie Generale des Eaux, the French water company.
The complaint highlights concerns about the lack of competition in the UK
cellular phone market where there are only two network companies - Cellnet
and Vodafone. BT has a majority shareholding in Cellnet and Securicor has a
minority stake.
The network operators are not allowed to offer their services directly to
consumers but are required to do so through service providers. Many service
providers have faced financial difficulties and operators have set up their
own network of service providers.
Talkland claims that the network operators cross-subsidise their own service
providers, which retail their handsets.
It also accuses the network operators of abusing their market position by
giving undue preference to their own 'tied' service providers and imposing
unfair contract terms on independent providers.
Oftel said that it was investigating the operators in accordance with its
duty to consider representations about telecommunications matters.
The investigation does not include - but might affect - Mercury
Communications and Hutchison Telecommunications, which also provide a
cellular service.
Sir James McKinnon, the gas regulator, accused British Gas yesterday of
dragging its feet over negotiations to open up its pipeline system to
competitors. British Gas immediately rejected the accusation, David
Lascelles writes.
This latest move in the long-running gas industry dispute follows agreement
this year by British Gas to yield its dominant share of the UK wholesale gas
market to stave off a monopoly inquiry.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Employers win appeal on union derecognition
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EMPLOYERS wishing to replace collective bargaining with personal contracts
will be encouraged by a ruling yesterday from the Employment Appeal
Tribunal.
By a two-to-one majority the appeal tribunal upheld an appeal by Associated
Newspapers, publishers of the Daily Mail, against an industrial tribunal's
decision that when it derecognised the National Union of Journalists it
penalised one of its journalists for union membership.
The dissenting voice was that of Mr Albert Blyghton, legal secretary of the
TGWU general union, one of the court's two lay members.
The NUJ said later that it would appeal against the ruling - if necessary to
the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg.
Mr David Wilson, the father (chairman) of the Daily Mail NUJ chapel (office
branch), had complained that Associated Newspapers had breached a section of
the 1978 Employment Protection (Consolidation) Act. He said he had been
denied a 4 1/2 per cent salary increase because he refused to sign an
individual contract.
The section concerned provides that 'every employee shall have the right not
to have action (short of dismissal) taken against him as an individual by
his employee for the purpose of . . . preventing or deterring him from being
or seeking to become a member of an independent trade union, or penalising
him for so doing'.
Mr Justice Wood said the issue was whether, after derecognition of a union,
an employee could succeed in a personal claim under the section.
In 1990, Associated Newspapers derecognised the NUJ for collective
bargaining, although staff remained free to be union members. Finally, all
but 15 of the 173 NUJ members at the Daily Mail signed individual contracts.
The industrial tribunal had found that in changing journalists' employment
terms and conditions and not paying the 4 1/2 per cent to those who did not
sign new contracts, Associated Newspapers had taken action against Mr Wilson
as an individual.
Mr Justice Wood said that derecognition had been aimed at all union members
equally and not against any individual and was therefore not covered by
section 23.
Mr Wilson could choose whether to accept the new contract terms. His union
membership was unaffected and he was not penalised for being a member.
The judge said Mr Blyghton's view was that Mr Wilson should be protected in
the same way as in the past non-union members had been protected against
discrimination in comparison with union members.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Nadir may face only 16 charges
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RAYMOND HUGHES, Law Courts Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ASIL NADIR, former chairman of Polly Peck International, may have to
answer only 16 of the more than 60 criminal charges brought against him. The
trial is due to start next March.
Mr Robert Owen QC, counsel for the Serious Fraud Office, told the High Court
yesterday that the provisional indictment contained 16 specimen charges of
theft against Mr Nadir and three of false accounting against his
co-defendant, Mr John Turner, PPI group chief accountant.
Mr Owen said: 'At present it is a provisional selection but we expect the
indictment to be of that order.'
He referred to the indictment when applying successfully for leave to seek
judicial review of the decision of the trial judge, Mr Justice Tucker, on
June 8 to throw out 46 charges against Mr Nadir alleging the theft of Pounds
119.5m from PPI.
Mr Owen said the judge had made an error of law which, if allowed to stand,
would amount to 'a fraudsters' charter'. If Mr Justice Tucker was right, a
company director could transfer funds to an overseas subsidiary, within the
terms of his ostensible authority to act on behalf of the company, without
committing a criminal offence, even if he subsequently moved funds on from
that subsidiary without authority.
He said that on Monday the judge had allowed the SFO to substitute 44 other
charges, alleging thefts from Unipac, PPI's Turkish-Cypriot subsidiary, for
the dismissed charges.
Ten of the present proposed specimen charges came from the substitutes.
Mr Owen said if the SFO won on judicial review and had the dismissed charges
restored, the specimen charges at trial would all relate to alleged thefts
from PPI.
The dismissed charges alleged theft by transfer of funds from PPI's bank
accounts to accounts of Unipac or Industrial Bank of Kibris, a Northern
Cyprus bank owned by Mr Nadir. Mr Justice Tucker, who said there was no
doubt Mr Nadir was authorised by PPI to make transfers, decided that the
transfers had been merely preparatory acts not involving misappropriation.
However, he said, there was evidence that the subsequent withdrawal of the
funds from Unipac and IBK accounts had been unauthorised.
The SFO contends that the judge erred in holding that Mr Nadir was
authorised to make the transfers, in circumstances where they were made, not
for PPI's purposes but for the dishonest purpose of then transferring funds
to himself or his private interests.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Channel 4 defends directors' rewards
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Channel 4 staff were paid a total of Pounds 800,000 as 'golden
handcuffs' last year, including a Pounds 250,000 payment to Mr Michael
Grade, chief executive.
The payments were in return for the signing of service contracts lasting
from three to five years to prevent poaching by bidders for ITV franchises.
The one-off payment took Mr Grade's salary for the year to a total of Pounds
485,000. Six other senior staff received payments that were the equivalent
of a year's salary.
Sir Richard Attenborough, the retiring chairman of Channel 4, defended the
controversial payments in the annual report published yesterday.
Securing the services of the management team, Sir Richard said, 'was an
absolute prerequisite for the future success and stability of the channel'.
Three directors doubled their 1991 salaries to between Pounds 180,000 and
Pounds 185,000. They were Mr Colin Leventhal, director of acquisitions, Mr
Frank McGettigan, general manager, and Mr David Scott, finance director.
The accounts also show a Pounds 5m provision for money lent to Bank of
Credit and Commerce International in the week before its collapse.
Sir Michael Bishop, chairman of British Midland Airways, is to succeed Sir
Richard as Channel 4 chairman. Mr David Plowright, who resigned as chairman
of Granada Television this year, is to be deputy chairman of the channel.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Accountants accused of slow response to change
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE accountancy profession has been slow to react to change and still
provides a service of variable quality, the new president of the Institute
of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales said in his inaugural speech
yesterday.
In an outspoken address at the institute's annual conference in Eastbourne,
Mr Ian Plaistowe defended self-regulation in the profession but also
identified flaws in the existing system.
He said its speed of reaction to recent issues had at times been 'glacial'
and had come only after prodding from the government.
He said that 'the best offices of the best firms are world beaters', but
that quality assurance mechanisms elsewhere among firms were 'patchy'.
Mr Plaistowe said the profession must be more responsive to the needs of the
public and ensure genuine accountability. He argued that, in the past,
professional institutes had remained too secretive, defensive, elitist and
liable to assume that professional status justified privilege.
He said that regulation was essential to modify the effects of market
forces, but that it was best achieved through self-regulation, which he said
was more flexible and sensitive than laws. Otherwise the profession would
become 'just any other business'.
He cast suspicion on calls for legal regulations for the accountancy
profession along the lines of the Securities and Exchange Commission in the
US, which he said represented introducing an 'isolated chunk of a different
corporate culture'.
Mr Plaistowe emphasised that no system of regulation would stop a determined
fraudster and any attempt to design such a system would be 'daft'.
He admitted that the British system of self-regulation had been increasingly
called into question by the fact that professionals are held in less awe
than formerly and by calls for government involvement.
Self-regulation should never be concerned with restricting the access of
non-professionals to the market. Professionals should succeed through
superior quality of service.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Lords decision adds to Sunday trade confusion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BETHAN HUTTON and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S House of Lords ruling left both retailers and councils even more
confused than before about their legal position on Sunday trading, with both
sides calling on the government to fulfil its pledges to legislate.
Supermarkets in most areas of England and Wales probably have at least one
more weekend to make the most of Sunday profits before being served with
injunctions, as most local authorities are studying the ruling before making
any decisions.
Retailers were left little the wiser about whether it was now 'legal' for
them to open stores on Sundays. Asda, the Leeds-based grocery chain, summed
up the uncertainty: 'At this stage we have not decided not to open our
stores.'
Stoke-on-Trent and Norwich city councils, whose case against B&amp;Q, the DIY
chain, is under consideration by the European Court, welcomed the Lords'
judgment.
Mr Paul Hodgson, Stoke's assistant town clerk, said: 'This is a major
breakthrough for councils which have been trying to uphold the law.'
Traders in Stoke are in the most immediate danger of injunctions. The
council said: 'Now that the fear of damages has gone, it has opened the way
to us to continue our policy of closing shops on Sunday and taking out
injunctions. Whether it will start this weekend it is a little too early to
say, but it will certainly start as soon as possible.'
Stores in Norwich may have more breathing space. Mr Richard Auton, Norwich's
director of law and administration, said it was likely that the council
would resume its policy of taking out injunctions, but not immediately.
The council may wait to hear the preliminary opinion of the European
advocate general on the B&amp;Q case, which is expected within a month.
Most retailers seemed likely to continue opening stores unless injunctions
specifically prevented them from doing so.
Mr Kevin Hawkins, corporate affairs director of WH Smith, which jointly owns
the Do-It-All DIY chain with Boots, said: 'In practical terms the difference
it will make or not make depends entirely on how a small minority of local
authorities react.'
As far as he was aware, the company would open all its stores this Sunday.
B&amp;Q said its stores would open unless injunctions were sought and obtained.
Mr Nigel Whittaker, corporate affairs director of Kingfisher, the retailing
group which owns B&amp;Q, said: 'The effect of this judgment is that it is open
sesame for local-authority action. But it must also be a massive incentive
for the government to sort the problem out as quickly as possible.'
Local authorities and retailers were united in the view that the ball was
firmly back in the government's court.
The British Retail Consortium, which represents 90 per cent of the retail
trade, said: 'This judgment does not take us any further forward. Retailers
are still looking to the government finally to agree what the law is in this
country as far as Sunday trading is concerned.'
Mr Andrew Scott, adviser to the Labour-dominated Association of London
Authorities on trading standards, hopes the ruling will 'act as a spur to
the government to bring forward proposals for reform'.
The Conservatives included a commitment to introduce legislation on Sunday
trading in its general election manifesto. In the Commons on June 18 Mr
Kenneth Clarke, home secretary, reaffirmed government intention to take
action on the issue. 'The House must address the issue, and reach some clear
solution,' he said. 'What we need is an accepted law on Sunday trading,
within which all retailers can compete on level terms.'
He stopped short of condemning retailers that opened their shops. 'No one is
breaking the law because the House of Lords has decided it is not clear what
the law is,' he said.
The government's position will probably be crystallised by the European
Court decision, due this autumn, and by Mr Ray Powell's private member's
bill, which is trying to change the law along the lines of proposals from
the Keep Sunday Special Campaign.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
LEGAL MILESTONES ON ROUTE TO THE JUDGMENT
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   April 1986: Shops Bill falls on second reading in Commons after
               Conservative backbench rebellion. Bill based on 1984 Auld
               Committee report which recommended all restrictions on
               Sunday trading be removed.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         1987: Conservative party's election manifesto promises reform.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         1988: Eleven courts involved in Sunday trading cases refer to
               European Court of Justice the question of whether Shops
               Act is incompatible with free movement of goods
               provisions of the Rome Treaty. The lead case is Torfaen v
               B&amp;Q.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
November 1989: European Court rules that Shops Act potentially
               incompatible with EC law. English and Welsh courts
               effectively told to see whether there is any other way of
               attaining objectives of Shops Act without general Sunday
               closure.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         1990: Several crown court trials result in store acquittals.
               Courts confused over meaning of European decision. Local
               authorities turn to legal injunctions.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    July 1990: High Court rules in case involving Stoke City Council
               and B&amp;Q that Shops Act not incompatible with EC law.
               Stoke given final injunction. B&amp;Q appeals direct to Law
               Lords.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
   April 1991: Court of Appeal rules in cases involving Kirklees and
               Wickes and Mendip and B&amp;Q that councils must give
               cross-undertakings to compensate for any losses suffered
               from enforced closure if stores eventually win their case
               in Europe. More than 100 injunctions set aside as
               councils cannot afford financial risk.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     May 1991: Law Lords adjourn appeal by B&amp;Q and refer a series of
               questions to the European Court. Law Lords want to know
               whether European Court's 1989 ruling in Torfaen case has
               been affected by its 1991 rulings in a Belgian case
               involving Marchandise and French case involving Conforma.
               In those cases the court ruled that national laws
               imposing restrictions on Sunday working were not
               incompatible with EC free movement of goods rules.
               Advocate general's preliminary opinion due on July 8 and
               judgment expected September/October.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
         1992: Conservatives reaffirm their intention to legislate.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
     May 1992: Mr Ray Powell, Usdaw-sponsored Labour MP, plans private
               member's bill to restrict further Sunday opening.
 -----------------------------------------------------------------------
 June 25 1992: Law Lords rule in favour of Kirklees in a case against
               Wickes, the DIY chain.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Creditors go to court to forestall BCCI pact

CREDITORS of the collapsed Bank of Credit and Commerce International tried
in the Luxembourg district court yesterday to prevent the implementation of
an agreement between the government of Abu Dhabi, which is the bank's
majority shareholder, and its liquidators.
Under the provisional agreement, creditors are offered a payment of between
Dollars 1.2bn (Pounds 640m) and Dollars 1.27bn in comparison with
liabilities of Dollars 8bn. Creditors must also give up rights to legal
redress against the majority shareholders.
The approval of the court is required before the settlement can take effect.
It was approved earlier this month by courts in the UK and the Cayman
Islands.
The final decision will not be reached before next week. The court decided
yesterday to postpone hearings until Tuesday.
In a hearing characterised by heated exchanges in French and English, the
main opposition to the plan came from the London-based creditors committee.
Mr James Lingard, of Norton Rose, solicitors to the committee, said: 'The
proposed contribution by the Abu Dhabi parties is inadequate.' He said that
the committee was looking for a payment of about Dollars 4bn.
He complained that the settlement was being forced on creditors even though
the liquidators had had limited access to BCCI papers held in Abu Dhabi.
He said: 'Until the Abu Dhabi parties make available to the liquidators all
relevant papers and witnesses in Abu Dhabi it is premature for the
liquidators to agree proposals which the creditors' committee find
unacceptable. Such a settlement will inhibit investigation into the
responsibility of the Abu Dhabi authorities for what occurred.'
He also complained that the proposed settlement was contrary to the
principle of law that all creditors should be treated equally unless they
have preferential rights under law. He argued that creditors with individual
claims against the bank were unfairly being asked to give up their rights.
An emotional intervention came from Mr Adil Elias, a Florida-based
businessman and a member of the creditors' committees in London and
Luxembourg. He denounced the liquidators as acting in the interests of Abu
Dhabi and not the shareholders. 'I lost all of my money. I lost millions and
I've had to sell my home to survive. We ask this court to give us justice.'
His lawyer cited a letter sent from Senator John Kerry, chairman of the US
Senate foreign relations sub-committee which is investigating BCCI. In the
letter Mr Kerry said: 'I remain deeply concerned about the impact of a
global settlement between the majority shareholders and the liquidators
before investigations have proceeded further.'
Lawyers representing Abu Dhabi said their clients were co-operating fully
with the Senate. They rejected any suggestion of wrongdoing on the part of
the majority shareholders. They argued that Abu Dhabi had been a victim of
fraud for a number of years and was not itself implicated in the fraud.
They said the liquidators would have access to all documents they needed to
conduct the liquidation once the agreement was signed.

FT  26 JUN 92 / M25 plan for 14 lanes announced
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CONTROVERSIAL plans to widen part of London's M25 orbital motorway to 14
lanes in Staines, west of London, were announced by Mr John MacGregor,
transport secretary, yesterday.
Mr MacGregor said the work, which is expected to cost Pounds 144m, was
essential to relieve congestion on the busiest section of motorway in
Britain, and would be carried out only after full consultations with those
affected.
The plans were welcomed by the Freight Transport Association as good news
for industry and the environment.
The environmental lobby reacted angrily. The Council for the Protection of
Rural England said the widening could only fuel 'a never-ending spiral of
traffic growth'.
The 126-mile M25 was completed only six years ago, but it is already
operating far beyond its design capacity because it created travel patterns
that were unforeseen by traffic forecasters. In September Mr MacGregor's
predecessor, Mr Malcolm Rifkind, announced Pounds 2.8bn for increasing the
motorway's capacity, notably by squeezing a new fourth lane in each
direction alongside the three existing ones.
The latest plan goes much further than that, parallelling the eight-lane
motorway with three-lane feeder roads in each direction between the M3 and
M4 junctions to keep local traffic off the motorway.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Attempt to save RiverBus
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of public and private interests is on the brink of launching an
effort to rescue RiverBus, London's loss-making Thames passenger service.
RiverBus is due to close on Tuesday as a result of the financial collapse of
Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf property development, which had subsidised it.
The administrators of Canary Wharf have refused to underwrite RiverBus's
losses beyond the end of this month. That means the company is due to become
insolvent and close at midnight on Tuesday.
Now a consortium of interests in London's Docklands is close to agreeing
proposals to inject Pounds 300,000 into the company to keep it going for
three months while attempts are made to save it.
The consortium is led by the London Docklands Development Corporation, the
state-owned body charged with the regeneration of Docklands. Members include
the Canary Wharf administrators, P&amp;O, several large Docklands businesses,
and local authorities in the Docklands area.
The consortium wants RiverBus to survive because it provides an important
transport link between central London and Docklands.
RiverBus is believed to be in talks with four interested parties, but none
is ready or willing to make an offer.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Texaco delays relocation to Canary Wharf
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER, Property Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TEXACO, the international oil company, threw its relocation to Canary Wharf
into doubt yesterday by announcing that its staff would not move to the
insolvent office project in London's Docklands in August as planned.
Texaco said it was delaying its move to Westferry Circus because of
uncertainty on several aspects, particularly the office environment and
services required inside and outside the buildings.
Its concerns are believed to include the future of the Jubilee Line
underground extension and the RiverBus service. Negotiations with Ernst &amp;
Young, the administrators to the Canary Wharf project, are continuing.
Mr Glenn Tilton, Texaco chairman, said: 'I must emphasise that we are
determined to ensure our relocation is conducted at the right time, in the
right way and on the right terms. Nothing less will do.'
Texaco's 1,000 staff will remain in their existing offices at Knightsbridge
Green, central London.
Canary Wharf went into administration on May 28 to protect it from creditors
 -a move that followed similar action by O&amp;Y in the US and Canada. The
beleaguered Canadian property giant is struggling to restructure debts of
Dollars 11.2bn (Pounds 5.98bn).
Texaco is the second prominent tenant to reconsider its move to Canary
Wharf. Last week American Express said it would not move there unless
Olympia &amp; York met its contractual obligations. Documents filed in a US
bankruptcy court showed that O&amp;Y owed American Express Pounds 22m on May 28.
American Express's position differs from that of Texaco in that its lease
agreement is complicated by incentives, notably the financial responsibility
for former premises.
Texaco's lease, which it signed in September 1989, was relatively
straightforward, as its leases on its Knightsbridge offices are due to
expire shortly.
Texaco was the first large company outside the City to sign up for Canary
Wharf. Like American Express, it is one of Canary Wharf's most illustrious
tenants.
Work on the Jubilee Line extension failed to start in March when a Pounds
40m payment from O&amp;Y to the government was not made. The money was to have
been the first instalment of O&amp;Y's Pounds 400m contribution to the Pounds
1.5bn project.
The government still expects the money to be put up by whoever buys Canary
Wharf.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Maxwell trusts hold 10m MGN shares
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW JACK
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MORE THAN 10m shares in Mirror Group Newspapers are among the assets held by
six secretive Liechtenstein trusts created by the late Robert Maxwell, a
lawyer representing the trusts said yesterday.
The shares appear to have been bought by the trusts as part of an alleged
share support operation to sustain the MGN price last summer.
Rival claims on ownership mean that Maxwell pensioners are unlikely to
benefit from the shares, which at the currently suspended price of 125p
would be worth at least Pounds 12.5m.
Mr Kamil Braxator, a lawyer with the General Trust Company in Vaduz,
Liechtenstein, told the BBC yesterday that six trusts created by Robert
Maxwell held MGN shares. The trusts - or Stiftungen - which he named at a
press conference in Liechtenstein last week, are Alandra, Baccano, Kiara,
Jungo, Corry and Akim.
Mr Braxator is drawing up an inventory of trust assets, and said there might
be other assets although they were not believed to contain any cash. He said
the trustees he represented were keen to return any assets to Maxwell
pensioners.
Separately, it has emerged that the MGN shares were ultimately bought by
Robert Maxwell Group - parent of the private Maxwell empire - and are likely
to be claimed by accountants Arthur Andersen, administrator to the Maxwell
private companies.
According to the MGN accounts released on Tuesday, Akim, one of the trusts,
has a beneficial interest in 20m MGN shares. These were lent back to the
private Maxwell empire and pledged to several banks as collateral for loans.
Andersen said in March that it had discovered the purchases of 10m MGN
shares funded through the private companies in late May last year, and a
further 10m in June. That lifted the total proportion of MGN's share capital
claimed by the administrators from 51 per cent to 54.8 per cent. It is
believed that money for the share purchases was provided through a Swiss
trust called Servex and a US company called TIB, and the transactions were
carried out by Goldman Sachs, the US investment bank.
The MGN purchases are in addition to separate alleged share-support
operations concerning Maxwell Communication Corporation, into which the
Serious Fraud Office announced an inquiry in December.
Daily Mirror journalists yesterday passed a motion of no confidence in the
MGN board and called on the directors to resign. They condemned pay rises
for Mr Vic Horwood, MGN chief executive, and Mr Ernest Burrington, who last
week resigned as chairman.

<TEXT>
THE IMPOSITION of a 20-day suspension of the US rail dispute was likely last
night after a Congressional sub-committee had voted yesterday to require
such a cooling-off period, Our Foreign Staff reports.
Acccelerated procedure in Congress was expected to pass the necessary order
to President George Bush's desk for signature by early today. An arbitrator
would impose a settlement at the end of the 20 days, if unions and employers
were still unable to agree on new contracts.
General Motors said last night it expects to idle three assembly plants
today and run shortened shifts at two others. This was the clearest sign yet
of industrial disruption flowing from the rail dispute. Rail operators in
the US have responded to the machinists' union strike by halting freight
operations across the country.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Iran-Contra prosecutor probing at 'highest level'
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
FURTHER indictments in the Iran-Contra scandal could occur this summer,
including charges against those at the highest level of President Reagan's
government, according to Mr Lawrence Walsh, the US chief special prosecutor.
In a report to Congress yesterday, Mr Walsh's office named no-one under
suspicion for having sought to conceal the shipment of arms to Iran in 1985,
which was intended to secure the release of hostages in Lebanon and the
proceeds of which were used to finance the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, in
contravention of a Congressional ban.
Mr Caspar Weinberger, defence secretary in the Reagan administration, was
charged last week by a grand jury with having lied about his knowledge of
the arms shipments. He has subsequently pleaded innocent and the provisional
date for his trial is the eve of the presidential election in early
November.
Mr Walsh's report hints that others of comparable seniority in the Reagan
government might also be implicated, and that the investigation should be
completed this summer.
'We are attempting to determine,' the report says, 'whether officials at the
highest level of government, acting individually or in concert, sought to
obstruct official inquiries into the Iran initiative  .. by supplying a
false account of the 1985 arms sales from Israeli stocks.'
The indictment against Mr Weinberger drew attention to a meeting on November
24 1986, attended by Mr Reagan, at which Mr Edwin Meese, then
attorney-general, is said to have given the opinion that a shipment of Hawk
missiles from Israel to Iran in 1985, though later authorised by the
president, may have contravened the Arms Export Control Act.

FT  26 JUN 92 / World Trade News: East European steel warning
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN governments should act to stimulate domestic demand for steel in
eastern Europe, relieving the pressure on local steelmakers to export at low
prices, according to a report by Meps (Europe), the steel consultancy.
East European governments, meanwhile, should press on quickly with
rationalisation, paving the way for generous privatisation terms to
encourage foreign investment in steel. The recommendations are made in East
European Steel, a 540-page report which analyses the problems of the steel
industries in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the former Yugoslavia and
the former Soviet Union.
The collapse of the former Soviet Union and political upheaval in eastern
Europe have seriously damaged these countries' traditional markets. East
European producers have tried to switch to exporting to western Europe,
provoking complaints from some western steelmakers about dumping.
The Meps report stresses that inward investment by the west, encouraged by
western governments, is essential to stimulate domestic demand for steel in
eastern Europe, thus defusing the row over imports to the west.
However, it warns of a potential obstacle to privatisation projects caused
by the imports issue.
Many east European privatisations in consumer goods have successfully used
low labour costs to produce finished products for domestic consumption and
more importantly, export to western markets, it says. But the strategy would
not be readily acceptable to the west in the steel sector.
East European Steel, Meps (Europe), 263 Glossop Road, Sheffield, S10 2GZ,
UK. Pounds 1,750.

ruling

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US International Trade Commission (ITC) ruled yesterday that subsidised
softwood exports from Canada were injuring the US lumber industry, paving
the way for possible punitive duties, Reuter reports from Washington.
Canada has said it will appeal against an adverse decision. The US Commerce
Department had found Canadian provincial governments subsidised softwood by
some 6.5 per cent, the level of countervailing duties if the ITC's 4-2 vote
is upheld.
An appeal would go to a dispute panel under the US-Canada free trade pact.
The action follows Canada's removal of a 15 per cent export tax it had
imposed to offset the provincial subsidies as part of a 1987 US-Canada
softwood accord.
US car makers have suffered a setback in efforts to win dumping duties on
Japanese minivan imports, George Graham reports. The Commerce Department
ruled last month that Toyota, Mazda and other Japanese makers had sold
minivans in the US below production cost, but the ITC decided this week that
US makers had not been harmed by the imports.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
PRESIDENT FW de Klerk, in an unprecedented response to the violence in South
Africa, yesterday in effect made next Monday a day of national mourning to
mark the funeral of the 42 victims of the Boipatong massacre.
He announced last night that the government would allow its employees to
attend the funeral and 'related mourning services' and called on the private
sector to do the same.
While making no mention of the African National Congress call earlier this
week for Monday to be a day of mourning, Mr de Klerk has given the move his
blessing.
In doing so, he may have helped to ease tensions on what will be an
emotional and fraught occasion.
'It is the government's sincere prayer that the atrocious events at
Boipatong will finally cause all South Africans to reflect,' Mr de Klerk
said in statement.
The announcement came at the end of day of local and international efforts
to break the country's political impasse.
Chief Emeka Anyaoku, the Commonwealth secretary-gen-eral, is expected to
arrive in Johannesburg by the weekend for a meeting with Mr de Klerk, while
the UN secretary-general, Mr Boutros Boutros Ghali, will meet Mr Nelson
Mandela, the ANC president, in Dakar, Senegal, on Sunday.
But South African officials played down speculation about a greater
international role in the crisis.
Mr de Klerk has said a figure of 'international repute' would join the
judicial commission that will investigate the Boipatong massacre, but
officials ruled out further outside involvement in efforts to end political
violence.
Efforts to arrange a meeting this week between Mr de Klerk and Mr Mandela
before the ANC leader flies to Dakar failed yesterday. The ANC said that Mr
de Klerk's office had said the president was 'unable to meet Mr Mandela
until some time next week.'
Meanwhile, the Reserve Bank said that South Africa's economic recession, now
in its third year, deepened in the first quarter of 1992, with real GDP
declining at an annualised rate of almost 2 per cent.
The outlook was 'fairly bleak", said the bank in its quarterly report,
citing 'disastrous dimensions' of the current drought, continuing political
violence, and uncertainty about constitutional negotiations.

SOUTH Africa's largest company, Anglo American Corporation, has signed a
ground-breaking labour relations agreement with the National Union of
Mineworkers (NUM), writes Philip Gawith.
The code of conduct accord is one of the most significant developments in
South African labour relations since the legalisation of black trade unions
in 1979.
The code, the first of its kind in the industry, is aimed at eliminating
violence in the mines and the violation of a wide range of labour and civil
rights. It applies to all gold and coal mines managed by Anglo.
At a signing ceremony this week, Mr Marcel Golding, assistant general
secretary of the NUM, which has more than 300,000 members, said the
agreements were of 'major historical significance'.
The code, and the accompanying agreement on dismissal and disputes
procedures, arose out of the bitter 1987 miners' strike.

   PARIS, WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN donor nations yesterday expressed support for India's economic
reform programme but warned that the momentum of change should be
maintained.
At the annual gathering in Paris of the India Aid Consortium, Germany
pressed for more radical and rapid privatisation of Indian state-owned
enterprises declaring that there was 'no alternative for getting more
efficiency'. Germany, backing recommendations by the World Bank, said that
in the financial sector 'painful reforms' were needed and should be taken
soon.
Mr Montek Ahluwalia, the Indian secretary for economic affairs, told the
two-day meeting, which is being held under the chairmanship of the World
Bank, that the Bombay financial scandal would be used by the government to
accelerate financial sector reform.
He said the government would establish mechanisms to tighten supervision of
the banking system and to ensure the banks maintained greater internal
controls.
India told donor nations that it planned to open negotiations next month for
an Extended Fund Facility (EFF) borrowing from the IMF - though there is
some doubt whether India will get access to the Fund's lowest-cost money.
The World Bank warned the meeting of the continuing fragility of India's
balance of payments.
The Bank also said that, because of stagnant domestic oil production, oil
imports were likely to increase by 60 per cent in nominal terms over the
next five years.
Reuter adds from Washington: The US House of Representatives last night
voted to cut Dollars 24m (Pounds 12.9m) from a foreign aid bill to signal
disapproval of alleged human rights abuses by India in Kashmir and Punjab.
The funds were part of Dollars 1.4bn in development aid in the bill.

FT  26 JUN 92 / OECD Economic Outlook: Industrial world set for slow growth
 -Unemployment forecast to stay high - No fall likely in European interest
rates
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HIGH European interest rates and weak demand in the US and Japan will
constrain economic growth across the industrialised world this year,
according to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development.
In its latest Economic Outlook, published yesterday, the Paris-based body
says non-residential investment in the OECD area will be flat this year
compared with 1991, while unemployment will stay high.
The group, which represents 24 leading industrial nations, says OECD-wide
company profits will probably expand 'more modestly' over the next few
years, compared with the faster pick-up after the previous period of slow
world growth in the early 1980s.
Helped by a sluggish recovery in the US and weak inflation in many nations,
'growth (in the OECD) should gradually accelerate in the coming months', but
at a slower rate than that expected by the organisation in its last Economic
Outlook, published last December.
With short-term interest rates across Europe influenced by the tight
monetary policy of the Bundesbank, 'there is little prospect that current
high real rates of interest (in Europe) will come down'. That could be
'burdensome' for those European countries - which include Britain, France
and Italy - where activity is weak and inflation low.
While many European nations are hemmed in on borrowing rates, constraints on
European fiscal policies linked to the Maastricht agreement reduce the
opportunity to promote growth through increases in public spending or tax
cuts.
In the US, the poor state of government finances which allows little room
for tax cuts, together with weak construction activity, will lead to demand
staying 'relatively weak' in the near term, the OECD says.
Meanwhile, in Japan, 'extremely slow money growth and the persisting
weakness of asset prices could delay the pick-up in activity'.
According to the report, the OECD economy should expand by 1.8 per cent this
year after 1 per cent in 1991. Last December, the organisation's economists
projected 1992 growth of 2.2 per cent.
Even though for the OECD as a whole 'recession has been avoided' over the
past year, growth is likely to be held back by the high debts built up
during the 1980s.
Spending by many consumers and businesses has been curtailed by their desire
'to strengthen their financial situation further before increasing their
expenditure, while financial institutions and banks may have become more
cautious in their lending'.
The OECD is relatively bullish about prospects for next year, when it
expects growth across the region to reach 3 per cent. But several worries
remain:
Further reductions in inflation are necessary in many countries, especially
in Germany. That could imply tight monetary policies 'that could restrain
demand in the short term'.
The efforts to bring down debts rather than to increase spending 'may have
further to go'. By reducing sales of goods and services and further damping
investment, this could hold back economic activity for some time.
Businesses and households remain cautious in many nations - partly because
of fears about unemployment and the general economic outlook.
Uncertainties about the outcome of the Uruguay Round of world trade talks,
may be further holding back growth.
There is a danger that, should Japan's trade surplus continue to grow, some
nations could restrict Japanese imports so 'hampering free international
trade and hence economic performance'.
The report reckons that the position of the OECD's estimated 30m unemployed
people (7.5 per cent of the workforce) 'is likely to improve only very
slowly'. Even though the rate for the whole of the OECD may fall next year,
for Europe the unemployment rate is expected to rise slightly in 1993 to 9.5
per cent.
Partly due to the large numbers of people out of work, pressure on wage
rates is likely to be modest, which could be one factor aiding growth.
Another is the generally favourable outlook for world trade, which is
expected to 'expand briskly' over the next 18 months, at annual rates of up
to 7 per cent.
Much of this is related, the report says, to strong demand in the former
communist nations in eastern Europe and in east Asia.
In particular, 'producers in both Japan and west Germany may seek to divert
output to foreign markets as domestic demand picks up only slowly'.
In other highlights, the OECD says:
OECD governments are likely to push up borrowing as a percentage ot total
output to 3.25 per cent this year, more than 0.75 percentage points higher
than last year. Most governments were unable to meet targets for debt
reduction last year, largely because of pressures on spending and weak
revenues related to the world economic slowdown.
Cash savings in the OECD resulting from reduced spending on defence after
the demise of Soviet communism will be 'modest in macroeconomic terms'. Even
though defence spending as a proportion of output is expected to decline
over the next five years in many OECD nations, the reductions are expected
to be significant only in the US and Germany, with smaller cuts in France,
Britain and the Netherlands. 'The net impact on aggregate demand and
employment. . . . is likely to be small, although the geographic
concentration of defence procurement industries may lead to severe local
labour-market problems in some cases.'
More efficient pricing mechanisms for air, land and water would increase
incentives to conserve such such resources and help safeguard the
environment. 'There is increasing recognition that greater reliance on
economic instruments - such as charges, taxes and tradeable permits  - can
lead to environmental problems being solved at lower costs,' the report
says.
Output by the newly industrialising nations of eastern Asia is likely to
increase this year by about 7 per cent for the fourth year running. The OECD
also expects inflation in these countries - South Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong,
Singapore, Thailand and Malaysia - to fall back after rising last year.
A collapse of trade among the newly independent republics of the former
Soviet Union is a 'serious risk', putting a question mark over economic
prospects for the region.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SIX people - three Israelis, one of them a soldier, and three Arabs - were
killed in the West Bank and Gaza Strip yesterday.
The deaths came as a sharp reminder of the simmering violence in the
occupied territories just two days after the Labour party won a general
election with the promise to speed Middle East peace talks.
Mr Yitzhak Rabin, the Labour leader, who is preparing to build a coalition
which he will head as prime minister, told a meeting of Labour's executive
committee he would deal with those who 'murder and incite' with force.
'Anyone who thinks a government headed by us will not deal with terror in
all its forms is making a bad mistake,' he said.
His comments echoed the tough stance he adopted against the Palestinian
uprising, or intifada, as defence minister in the late 1980s.
The death toll yesterday was the biggest in one day in the occupied
territories for months. The soldier and the Palestinians died in a gunbattle
in the West Bank, the army said. In the Gaza Strip, two Jewish vegetable
merchants were stabbed to death.
Mr Rabin was pressed yesterday by Meretz, the pro-peace minority party which
is set to be Labour's main coalition partner, to speed the process of
forming a government.
Meretz leaders expressed irritation that Mr Rabin, who is anxious to
minimise right-wing opposition to his peace policies, was seeking to broaden
the coalition by including at least one religious party.
He is also waiting for the final official election results to be published.
Inclusion of the army vote could produce a marginal adjustment of the
distribution of seats which Mr Rabin wants to take into account before
starting coalition negotiations.
Mr Moshe Arens, outgoing defence minister, announced meanwhile he was
quitting politics. Mr Arens had been thought to be a key contender to
succeed Mr Yitzhak Shamir as Likud leader. Mr Shamir has already indicated
he will quit the leadership in the wake of Likud's election defeat.

FT  26 JUN 92 / OECD Economic Outlook: Maastricht sets stiff test for EC
states
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH, Economics Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ONLY three EC nations can meet the Maastricht targets on fiscal policies
without heavy curbs on government spending, says the OECD. For Italy,
Greece, Belgium and the Netherlands, meeting the limits would need spending
cuts over the next seven years.
The OECD study highlights the difficulties faced by many countries in
achieving the targets to reduce state borrowing before economic and monetary
union around 2000.
The problems are worsened by high interest rates and the economic slowdown,
which has pushed up government borrowing for many countries.
Only France and Luxembourg meet both targets for general government net
borrowing and gross government debt. According to the guidelines, these
should by 1999 be no more than 3 per cent and 60 per cent respectively of
gross domestic product.
Four nations would have to cut spending (assuming unchanged tax rates) to
meet one or both of the limits. Of these, Belgium and Greece face measures
that 'would probably be too severe to envisage'. They would have to cut
spending by 6.6 per cent and 6.1 per cent a year respectively up to 1998,
while Italy's spending would need to be trimmed by 7.7 per cent a year. The
Netherlands would have to reduce spending by 0.3 per cent a year.
For the other eight EC nations, five would have to take tough, if more
moderate, action to achieve the targets. These nations would have to keep
increases in spending during the next seven years below levels envisaged for
1990-92 or below the levels experienced during the 1980s.
Just three countries - France, Britain and Luxembourg - would experience
little difficulty in meeting the targets.
This is because they already meet the limits, or because the permitted
spending increases during the 1990s are smaller than, or the same as, those
applying during the 1980s or projected for 1990-92.

FT  26 JUN 92 / German MPs pass liberal abortion law
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By QUENTIN PEEL
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   BONN
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE GERMAN Bundestag voted early today for liberalisation of the country's
strict abortion law, in spite of a strong campaign against the move by the
Roman Catholic church.
After 14 hours of debate, and almost two hours of voting on a series of
resolutions from various political parties, the only resolution to gain a
majority was a joint proposal from the opposition Social Democrats and the
Free Democrats, a minority party in the ruling coalition.
Of 657 members of the Bundestag, 357 voted in favour of liberalisation.
This means that abortion will be available to women in Germany who have
obtained formal advice from a doctor on the consequences.
An alternative proposal by Chancellor Helmut Kohl's Christian Democratic
Union (CDU), which would have given responsibility for a final decision to
the doctor concerned, was rejected.
Mrs Rita Sussmuth, Bundestag president, led a revolt of liberal Christian
Democrats against her party. Brushing aside a demand for her resignation
from Mr Theo Waigel, leader of the conservative Christian Social Union
(CSU), the CDU's associate in the governing coalition, Mrs Sussmuth made a
passionate plea for the right of German women to decide for themselves.
The vote was the culmination of two years of agonising over the abortion
issue. The political wrangling came about because East and West Germany were
unable to reconcile their very different abortion laws on unification in
1990. West Germany had restrictive laws; East Germany had virtual abortion
on demand.
Backed by Germany's Roman Catholic bishops, a majority of the CDU and CSU
argued for the 'protection of the unborn child' - leaving abortion as a
crime unless approved by a doctor. Their proposal would have required
precise justification of any abortion on physiological or psychological
grounds.
The alternative simply requires doctors to give formal advice on the
consequences of abortion to any prospective mother seeking to terminate her
pregnancy.
'Nobody can save the life of a child against the mother's will,' Mrs
Sussmuth declared, to a storm of applause from the opposition benches. 'We
must think of both the protection of the unborn life, and of the mother. . .
We must stop saying that women are incapable of taking their own decisions.
No-one can take away from the woman herself the final decision.'
Although a free vote was declared by the main political parties, the split
among the Christian Democrats is another embarrassment for Chancellor Kohl
while the popularity of his coalition government is shaky.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Serbs agree to halt shelling of Sarajevo civilians
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
SERB FORCES besieging Sarajevo yesterday announced they would halt the
bombardment of civilian targets in the Bosnian capital as they launched an
offensive in other parts of the republic.
The news came as the European Community failed to revive peace negotiations
yesterday in Strasbourg after what EC mediator Lord Carrington called
disheartening talks with leaders of the warring republics.
In Sarajevo, General Lewis MacKenzie, the commander of United Nations
forces, said Mr Radovan Karadzic, a Serb leader from Bosnia, had agreed to
relocate heavy artillery guns to allow UN forces to resume work on opening
the airport for relief flights.
As Radio Sarajevo reported continuing attacks on parts of the city,
diplomats based in Belgrade were sceptical that the agreement would hold.
However, one diplomat said it might 'indicate that the Serbs have decided to
put the train on a different track, to lock in territorial gains by
exchanging land for peace'. But Gen MacKenzie, reached by telephone in
Sarajevo, warned: 'If the initiative failed because of Serb actions it would
have a serious impact on their credibility.'
He declined to comment on how far the artillery, which has destroyed much of
Sarajevo, would be moved from the beleaguered capital. Serb leaders
yesterday did not elaborate on what constituted a civilian target. Gen
Mackenzie said the agreement could pave the way for reopening the airport
for emergency aid to relieve some 300,000 people trapped in Sarajevo with
little food and chronic shortages of water and electricity.
Lord Carrington said he got nowhere in a day of separate talks with the
presidents of Serbia and Croatia and the foreign minister of
Bosnia-Herzegovina.
'I think today was disheartening but we're going to go on trying. There has
got to be a solution in the end,' the former Nato secretary-general told a
news conference. It was the first round of talks since the UN Security
Council imposed sanctions on Serbia and came amid talk of a possible Western
military intervention in the Yugoslav war.
Bosnia's foreign minister, Mr Haris Silajdzic, shared Lord Carrington's
gloom, saying he was even less optimistic about bringing peace to his
republic, where more than 7,000 people have been killed.
Both men criticised Serbian President Slobodan Milosevic's refusal to
recognise Bosnia-Herzegovina as a sovereign state. But Lord Carrington said
he also expressed concern at reports of violations of a UN ceasefire in
Croatia by Zagreb's armed forces and was disappointed that Croatian
President Franjo Tudjman had said he would not withdraw the forces.
Judy Dempsey adds from Belgrade: The Serbian authorities have asked the UN
to unfreeze some of its the republic's assets held abroad in order to meet
debt repayments which fall due this year, according to bank officials in
Belgrade. These reserves, which total Dollars 2bn, include the federal
reserves, which amount to Dollars 1.5bn, and commercial bank reserves, which
total Dollars 500m. A small, undisclosed sum is held in Belgrade.
Serbia has proposed to Greece that the two Balkan countries form a
confederation, including a joint military command. President Milosevic said
in a television interview broadcast yesterday. Reuter reports from Athens.
'I believe a Greek-Yugoslav confederation would not only be a factor of
stability in the area but would also serve the interests of both the Greek
and Serbian people,' he said in the interview with Athens' private Antenna
television channel.
Mr Milosevic said he had proposed the idea of a confederation to Greek Prime
Minister Constantine Mitsotakis, who has close relations with the Serbian
leader.

THE presidents of Russia, Ukraine, Romania and Moldova agreed yesterday on
steps to end the conflict between Moldovan forces and Slav separatists in
TransDnestr, the eastern region of Moldova, Reuter reports from Istanbul.
A communique after a two-hour meeting in the Turkish city called for the
opening of corridors for humanitarian aid and free movement of civilians and
observers from the four governments. It said Russia would eventually
withdraw its 14th army from the conflict zone, as Moldova has demanded.
Also meeting in Istanbul, Turkey and eight former communist states of the
Black Sea region joined Greece and Albania in signing a framework economic
agreement in an attempt to revive trade relations stalled since the collapse
of the Soviet Union, John Murray Brown reports. A call was made for
'effective mechanisms to achieve a higher degree of economic co-operation'
in areas such as transport, telecommunications, infrastructure and
environment.
The summit grouped Turkey, six former Soviet republics (Russia, Ukraine,
Georgia, Moldova, Azerbaijan, Armenia) and Romania, Bulgaria, Greece and
Albania. A Turkish official said the 11 countries would 'probably' set up a
bank on the lines of the European Development Bank or the World Bank.
Member countries seemed just as intent to stress the need for political
solutions to the region's ethnic problems. Georgian leader Eduard
Shevardnadze warned that the Black Sea project could prove 'stillborn'
unless the region's security was guaranteed.

FT  26 JUN 92 / The Lisbon Summit: A mix of money, members and making
decisions
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
THE EUROPEAN Community summit which starts in Lisbon today promises to be an
unusual mix of the predictable and unpredictable, write David Buchan and
Patrick Blum in Lison.
Two things are sure. One is that EC leaders will tackle three main problems
 -the shape of Community finances for the 1990s, the degree to which the EC
should be run in a more decentralised manner, and the rate of admission of
new countries.
The second certainty is that none of these problems is ripe for final
settlement. But the Lisbon summit looks likely to determine the key
inter-relationship of all three issues, though quite how is this summit's
most unpredictable element.
Indeed, this trio of big issues has already become linked into the
overwhelming question mark placed over the Community by the uphill struggle
to ratify its Maastricht union treaty.
Financing. The Portuguese presidency has put this at the top of the agenda,
to be discussed first thing this morning, not least because Portugal, along
with Spain, Ireland and Greece, stands to get a further doubling of EC
structural aid over the next few years under the Commission's budgetary
plans.
Spain, in particular, has warned it might not ratify Maastricht unless it
gets a firm pledge at Lisbon of sufficient 'cohesion' aid. This threat is
weakened by the fact that Denmark's rejection has already placed Maastricht
in danger, but it cannot be ignored. Mr Jacques Delors, the commission
president, has already sought to bridge the EC's north-south gap by this
week conceding that his plan to raise EC spending by one third, from Ecu63bn
(Pounds 44bn) this year to Ecu83bn in 1997, could be spread over two further
years. An increase in the Community's revenue ceiling could be similarly
stretched out over the longer period.
The EC south might swallow this, provided Lisbon indicates that any scaling
down of Mr Delors' spending plan would hit policies such as EC research
programmes rather than cohesion aid. But the volatility of EC spending will
be underlined by discussion at Lisbon of Italy's milk quota problem. Future
EC spending plans are based on the assumption that farm expenditure will be
brought under control by the recent common agricultural policy reform, the
one big triumph of Portugal's presidency. But Italy nearly derailed this
reform, by insisting on a big increase in its milk quota, in order to avoid
a fine of as much as Ecu1.5bn for massive over-production of milk. Italy has
carried its demand to Lisbon.
Subsidiarity. In the wake of Denmark's rejection of Maastricht, Mr Delors
has readily seconded the insistence by German chancellor Helmut Kohl and UK
prime minisBrussels' giving national governments more role in administering
EC rules should get a thorough airing at Lisbon.
The EC leaders will first want to hear from Mr Delors on this. He is
increasingly making the link between Community policy ambitions and
subsidiarity in the area of EC research. The Commission president this week
admitted his disappointment that most states oppose his plan to boost EC
industry's international competitiveness through expanded EC-wide research.
Poorer states feel they do not have the high-tech companies to benefit,
while some richer countries, such as Germany and the UK, are ideologically
inclined against more public interventionism.
What lies behind Mr Delors' controversial suggestion of subsidiarity in
control of state aid is his feeling that, if the Community will not help its
industry more, it must leave individual governments freer to do so. With the
commission poised, for instance, to approve next week FFr6.6bn (Pounds 670m)
in French state to Bull, France's publicly owned computer company, this line
of Mr Delors may give leaders such as Mr Major pause about subsidiarity.
Enlargement. The Maastricht summit last December instructed the commission
to report on the overall implications of enlargement - accepting new member
states. The Danish rejection of Maastricht killed earlier commission ideas
that major institutional reform - going beyond anything in the Maastricht
pact - must accompany enlargement. But the final version of the commission
paper says 'the new treaty (Maastricht) must be ratified' before entry
negotiations can start with Austria, Finland, Sweden and Switzerland.
This pre-condition is likely to get backing from virtually all leaders, but
not Mr Major. Much of the division here turns on which is the best tactic
for prompting the Danes into second thoughts on Maastricht - to hold their
desire for enlargement hostage to full treaty ratification or (as the UK
believes) to let fellow Nordics lead them into the new European union. By
contrast, all leaders are agreed that other applicants for EC membership -
Turkey, Cyprus and Malta - must be left in the waiting room.

The electorate rejected the treaty in a June 2 referendum. Mr Bjorn Westh,

binding and could not simply be reversed.
The consequences of the referendum rebuff are not on the agenda in Lisbon,
but Mr Schluter said he expects to discuss the matter.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
AT LAST, the Centro Cultural de Belem, known as CCB or less charitably as
'the bunker', has found its true vocation as the building hosting the Lisbon
summit.
Squatting on the banks of the Tagus river on the outskirts of Lisbon, the
conference centre was built at a cost of about Dollars 222m as the showpiece
of Portugal's six-month EC presidency. The sprawling set of low, pinkish
buildings contrasts starkly with the elegant Jeronimos monastery across the
road.
But striking a blow for elegance was not the objective of the CCB.
Security considerations ensured there would be few windows on the sunnier
south-facing riverside: terrorists would find it hard to take a pot shot
while bobbing up and down on the river. But the Portuguese authorities are
not taking any chances. Naval boats patrol the river and heavily armed
police, including special anti-terrorist units, are part of a 2,000-strong
security task force put together to ensure nothing spoils the occasion.
It is an easier task for the police than the nightmare of ensuring the
safety of more than 70 ministers during a meeting in May to discuss aid to
the former Soviet Union. Only President Francois Mitterrand of France enjoys
the outstanding view to the river, with a corner office that also overlooks
the gardens at the front of the building.
'It's the best room, but that's only because he's head of state - the others
are just prime ministers, but they've all got nice views over the gardens,'
said one official.
Whether by chance or choice, the office of Mr Anbal Cavaco Silva, the
Portuguese prime minister, looks onto the 16th century monastery, enabling
him to reflect on the passage of time and on how quickly Portugal's moment
in the sun at the helm of the EC presidency has gone by.
In central Lisbon, traffic has become even more chaotic than usual, as
streets have been barred to traffic near the two hotels where delegations
stay, except for Mr Mitterrand who is breaking ranks by staying at the
French ambassador's residence.
The Lisbon summit may not be as dramatic as that of Maastricht, but
Portuguese enthusiasm ensures a party atmosphere. The only cloud arises from
customs workers, who have been striking against dismantling of EC borders
and the prospect of losing their jobs.

<TEXT>
A MAJORITY of EC leaders at today's summit are likely to back the European
Commission's insistence that the Maastricht union treaty be ratified before
any negotiations for other countries to join the Community.
This will leave Prime Minister John Major isolated in his belief that the
start to enlargement negotiations with European Free Trade Association
(Efta) countries need not necessarily await resolution of the fate of the
Maastricht pact on political and monetary union.
The final version of the commission's hotly contested paper on enlargement
of the Community clearly states that 'the new treaty (of Maastricht) must be
ratified' first. It goes on to say that 'the entry negotiations, which could
then begin, must be conducted so as to contribute to the reinforcement of
the union'.
Referring to the neutrality of all four Efta applicants - Austria, Sweden,
Finland and Switzerland - the paper says new members 'must equally accept
and be capable of following the common foreign and security policy which
will be elaborated in coming years'. Any country whose constitutional
position would prevent it joining other EC states in foreign commitments
'would not be able to integrate itself into the union in a satisfactory
manner'.
The UK government, which takes over the EC presidency from Portugal next
week, agrees with its partners that all new members must subscribe to all of
the goals of the Maastricht treaty. But, keen to demonstrate the Community's
openness to Denmark's fellow-Nordic countries and thus to influence Danish
public opinion, it wants the Lisbon summit to commit the Community to open
enlargement talks early next year, irrespective of the Maastricht treaty's
fate.
The final commission paper drops earlier controversial ideas from Brussels
that the Community should adopt more voting by majority in order to prevent
decision-making in a larger Community seizing up.
It also indicates how the summit will probably tackle the diplomatically
sensitive question of what to say to non-Efta applicants for EC membership.
Such countries as Cyprus, Malta, and Turkey must continue to wait, but the
Community 'should try with all the means at its disposal to promote their
economic development'.
As for potential EC applicant countries in central Europe, the commission
says the Community 'must now commit itself to preparing them economically,
even if their membership only seems possible in a very distant future'.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Surprise but little regret among institutional investors
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By NORMA COHEN and MAGGIE URRY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE sudden resignation of Mr Robert Horton immediately hit the group's share
price in New York trading.
The shares - traded as American Depositary Receipts in New York - closed
Dollars 5 1/4 down at Dollars 49 1/8 , equivalent to about 216p a share.
They had closed in London at 243p before the resignation was announced.
Analysts and institutional investors reacted to the resignation with
surprise but no great regret. Mr Horton, they said, had been an effective
manager with an abrasive and aloof personal manner.
While there had been little love lost between Mr Horton and his largest
institutional shareholders, they said his departure was a boardroom coup
rather than a shareholder revolt.
Mr Horton's downfall, according to brokers and shareholders alike, had been
his increasingly untenable commitment to maintain the company's dividend in
real terms. 'The assumption is that he made the dividend a resignation
issue, and lost,' one said.
The immediate cause of the share price fall was uncertainty over the group's
dividend, which is now expected to be cut.
With Mr Horton gone, analysts thought BP would now cut the payout, which is
only about half-covered on forecasts of 1992 earnings.
The dividend cost Pounds 905m in 1991 and analysts are forecasting earnings
of about Pounds 450m in 1992.
Earlier this year Mr Horton was forced to modify his dividend commitment,
but reassured shareholders that the payout policy aimed for real growth over
time.
However, shareholders and analysts believe that BP cannot keep that promise
without sacrificing critical spending on exploration and development and
damaging the company's future.
'He seemed prepared to jeopardise the company's long term future just to
maintain the dividend,' said one large shareholder.
Low oil prices and recession pushed BP into its first historic-cost loss in
the first quarter of the current year.
BP has cut capital spending and costs, and made redundancies. Among
employees, the policy earned Mr Horton the soubriquet 'Hatchet Horton'.
Shareholders said that tales of badly sagging morale were emerging from BP.
'Matters had come to a head,' said one institution. 'Morale had reached a
very low point.'
This appears to have been aggravated by Mr Horton's personal style.
Shareholders yesterday expressed satisfaction at BP's decision to split the
roles of chairman and chief executive between Lord Ashburton and David
Simon.
In meetings with Mr Horton earlier this year, investors had raised the
matter with him and asked him to separate the roles.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Sunday trading may end after legal ruling
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT RICE and JOHN THORNHILL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
HUNDREDS of do-it-yourself stores and supermarkets in England and Wales
could be forced to close on Sundays from this weekend following a ruling by
the law lords yesterday.
The ruling restores local authorities' power to enforce the Sunday trading
laws.
The House of Lords overturned a 1991 Court of Appeal ruling that prevented
councils from obtaining injunctions banning Sunday opening. The Court of
Appeal had said the councils were not entitled to injunctions unless they
undertook to compensate stores for loss of profits in the event of the
English law being overturned by the European Court of Justice.
A ruling from the European Court is expected in October.
The Appeal Court ruling - in a case brought by Kirklees Borough Council in
West Yorkshire against Wickes, the DIY chain - had made the 1950 Shops act,
which governs Sunday trading, virtually unenforceable. Before the ruling,
councils had obtained hundreds of injunctions to enforce Sunday closing on
DIY stores and other chains.
In a surprising twist to the long-running battle, the law lords also said
that if the Shops act were eventually declared incompatible with EC law, it
was the UK government and not local authorities which would be liable to
compensate stores.
Ministers said they needed time to study the judgment, but their immediate
reaction was that the decision underlined the need for the government to act
quickly once the European Court has ruled in the autumn.
Although the threat of having to pay compensation appeared to have come as a
surprise, ministers pointed out that it would still be for local authorities
to decide whether to seek injunctions against retailers.
Kirklees welcomed what it called 'an historic ruling'. Councillor Jeremy
Cuss said: 'Now the position on injunctions has been clarified, we will be
writing to certain companies asking them to comply with the law.'
Most councils, however, were taking a cautious stance.
Wickes said it intended to open most of its 65 stores this Sunday. 'If local
authorities choose to proceed (with injunctions), jobs will be lost, adding
to unemployment, and millions of pounds of taxpayers' money will be wasted,'
it said.
The big supermarket chains - such as J. Sainsbury, Tesco, Safeway and Asda,
which have been opening hundreds of their superstores every Sunday since
before Christmas - were wary of commenting before studying the judgment.
In the absence of injunctions against specific stores, it seemed likely that
most of the big chains would continue to trade seven days a week at selected
locations.
J. Sainsbury, which opens 139 of its 316 supermarkets and 68 Homebase DIY
stores, said: 'We currently have no plans to change the pattern of our
Sunday trading.'

FT  26 JUN 92 / Horton is ousted as chairman of British Petroleum: Directors
point to personality clashes as reason for shock decision
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID LASCELLES, Resources Editor
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR ROBERT HORTON, the chairman and chief executive of British Petroleum, one
of Britain biggest companies, resigned last night in what appeared to be a
coup by his fellow directors.
Mr Horton was confronted by BP directors at a meeting earlier this week.
They made clear last night that it was problems of personality rather than
business strategy which lay behind the decision to replace Mr Horton.
In a sudden announcement after markets closed, BP said its 17-member board
had accepted Mr Horton's resignation 'with considerable sadness'. Board
members made clear they were concerned about the concentration of power in
the hands of Mr Horton, one of the UK's most forceful business executives.
His position is to be split between Lord Ashburton, a non-executive
director, who becomes chairman, and Mr David Simon, chief operating officer,
who will take over as group chief executive.
Mr Horton, who is 52 and only assumed his position in 1990, said in a
statement: 'I have reluctantly concluded it is in the best interests of BP
that I should leave the company. I do so in the knowledge that BP has a fine
team to see it through a difficult period, which has combined low product
prices with a depressed chemical industry performance.'
Last night's remarkable developments come at a time when BP is under severe
financial pressure because of the recession and the weakness of the oil
price. The company is going through a Pounds 750m cost-cutting exercise with
the loss of hundreds of jobs.
Lord Ashburton, formerly Sir John Baring of the Barings merchant bank, said
he and his fellow directors had been increasingly concerned about the way
the company was being run. 'We came to the unanimous conclusion to discuss
with Bob Horton the need to make a change at the top,' he said.
He said directors believed the governing structure of BP should be changed
to split the role of chairman and chief executive, and particularly that BP
should have a full-time chief executive.
Asked whether Mr Horton's personal style, which has been described as
arrogant and abrasive, played a role in the board's decision, Lord Ashburton
said: 'We felt the company would be better organised if we had a change of
individual.'
He said there was nothing specific in Mr Horton's handling of the company
which had prompted the directors to act. 'It was an accumulation of
feelings, of events, all quite small in themselves,' he said.
The non-executives directors' anxieties grew over some months. Finally, at a
meeting earlier this week they confronted Mr Horton with the need for
change. When he saw the position, Mr Horton immediately offered to resign.
The executive directors, who are in a minority, supported the changes. A
further board meeting, from which Mr Horton was absent, took place yesterday
to ratify the changes. The terms of Mr Horton's severance have not yet been
addressed.
Lord Ashburton said BP was fortunate in having in Mr Simon 'a successor as
chief executive who has wide experience of the group'. Mr Simon, 52, had
previously held positions as chief financial officer and chief executive of
BP Oil, the group's exploration and production arm. He was also Mr Horton's
chief rival for the top job in 1990 on the retirement of Sir Peter Walters.
His appointment to the chief executive position will be seen in the City as
a sweet, if belated, victory in that earlier contest. It was also expected
to be a popular choice within BP where Mr Horton's manner had not endeared
him to staff. The combination of his dominant personality and the swingeing
job cuts had begun to depress morale.
Mr Simon stressed that last night's upheaval would not result in dramatic
changes in BP's business direction or in wider staff or structural changes.
'This is about the style of running the company at the top', he said. 'It is
not about changes in strategy.'
Analysts also speculated that a factor in Mr Horton's resignation had been
boardroom division over dividend policy.
Under Mr Horton, BP has steadfastly refused to cut its dividend in spite of
falling profits and rising debt levels, a policy which initially pleased
BP's large institutional shareholders but which, more recently, came to be
viewed as short-sighted because it ate into investment budgets.
In the first quarter of this year, BP's profits fell 80 per cent to the
point where they did not cover the company's unchanged dividend. Mr Simon
refused to comment in detail on BP's performance in the current quarter for
which results will be announced August.
He denied that dividend policy disagreements had contributed to Mr Horton's
resignation.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (12): Where to spend the winter - A look at
the 1994 Olympics in Lillehammer
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
LAST February, at the conclusion of the 16th Winter Olympics, the French
city of Albertville passed the flag of the five rings on to Lillehammer, a
sleepy Norwegian town two hours' drive north of Oslo, which will host the
next winter games in 1994.
In the best possible marketing scheme for Lillehammer that could have been
devised, the Norwegians took Albertville by storm, winning nine Olympic
golds, six silvers and five bronze medals.
Their success is expected to attract tens of thousands of tourists to Oslo
and Lillehammer in February 1994 and, it is hoped, thereafter. Up to 100,000
people will attend the 1994 games, it is estimated.
However, controversy over the NKr13bn investment for the Lillehammer games
has dominated domestic headlines alongside more important concerns such as
Norway's record high post-war unemployment and health care queues. The
prospects for 1994 have lifted the spirits of many Norwegians. But it will
take time for morale to recover from the deep economic recession of the past
few years.
Take Asborg, for example - a single, unemployed mother of three - for whom
the Lillehammer Olympics evokes only mixed feelings: 'My children are very
proud that Norway will host the games but with the economy the way it is I
can't help but feel that the money could be better spent.
'And there are all those stories about the organisers . . . the elitists who
are living the high life at the expense of the taxpayers. But I truly hope
the Olympics will be good public relations for Norway. I have German and
American friends already looking forward to Lillehammer who otherwise would
never have visited Norway,' Asborg says.
That is precisely what the organisers are counting on: first-time visitors
will return to Norway after the games, while millions of television viewers
all over the world will be inspired to visit after being won over by
Norway's wholesomeness and charm in a relentless PR saturation exercise,
lasting several hours every day for more than two weeks.
'The success of the Olympics hinges to a great extent on our success with
the media side of things,' one of the organisers said recently. But some
Norwegians can't help but feel that the timing for Norway's hosting of the
games is just slightly awkward.
Lord of the Rings, a book by Vyv Simson and Andrew Jennings of Granada TV's
World in Action team, does little to stem the embarrassment of those who,
like Asborg, are more concerned about such social problems as health care
and unemployment then they are about the number of cars which roll into
Lillehammer on any given day.
It criticises the elitist aspect of the Olympic organisation, with
particular emphasis on Mr Juan Antonio Samaranch, the International Olympic
Committee's president, and his inner circle. But LOOC's organisers, facing a
daunting task ahead of 1994, tend not to get bogged down in criticism and
controversy which they say comes with the job. 'The discussion over
investment and snobbery is something many of us simply have to live with. I
think this is a healthy and good project which puts Norway in a totally new
international position,' says Mr Aage Enghaug, LOOC's senior vice-president
of information.
The Norwegians, admittedly, have ulterior motives in staging the games
rather than just for the sake of sport. And who can blame them? The games
provide a unique opportunity to promote Norway and stimulate tourism,
particularly in Hedmark and Opland, the country's two counties which do not
have access to the sea.
'The continental regions in the eastern part of the country have hardly
profited from the growth experienced by coastal regions over the last
decades,' says the Olympic Triangle, a collaboration between the county
boroughs and municipalities in the Lillehammer region. It believes that
investment in the Olympics will not only help to develop their region as a
popular tourist attraction and educational centre but will also contribute
towards improving infrastructure and expanding jobs.
LOOC is going to great lengths to present Norway as a country founded on
strong, simple traditions which allow a high standard of living without the
excesses of materialism.
Central to this image is the fact that winter sports are part of the
country's national identity. Ancient petroglyphs depicting 4,000-year-old
skiers from the Stone Age have been discovered and LOOC is exploiting them
to the full.
Skiing is deeply embedded in Norwegian tradition; a 12th century skier is
featured on the city of Lillehammer's coat of arms. Among other cultural
events, the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics will highlight
Viking folklore and old Norse mythology.
As Thor Heyerdahl, the anthropologist, put it: 'Norway, the land of the
Vikings in the far north, the country that has held her doors open to
distant expeditions for more than 1,000 years, is now inviting all the
people of the world to cross her boundaries in friendly rivalry' in what
LOOC is calling the country's greatest-ever festival.
The Olympic facilities are already about 60 per cent completed. They will be
finished for the 1993 winter season when a number of winter sports
competitions will be staged to test Lillehammer's preparedness.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (11): Best place to live in Europe - The
Good Life

MANY Norwegians might not believe it, but their country is rated the best in
Europe to live in, according to a new study published by the United Nations.
After surveying 160 different countries on the basis of variables such as
expected life span, economy, educational standards and use of resources, the
report suggests that Canada has the highest rating followed by Japan with
Norway in third place. For women in the world only Sweden is better for the
good life than Norway.
The average Norwegian household spent just under Dollars 29,000 in private
consumption in the 1988-90 period. Spending on rent, fuel and power
accounted for 23.4 per cent, for single people it was 30.8 per cent.
Families with small children spent 29.6 per cent of their income on rent,
fuel and power compared with 25.7 per cent in the 1986-88 period.
A total of 19.7 per cent of household spending went on transport and
communications, a fall from the 23 per cent in the earlier period, mainly
due to the big drop in the number of new cars being purchased.
Food constituted 14.9 per cent of total household spending from 1988-90 with
6.6 per cent of household expenditure devoted to clothing and footwear.
Beverages and tobacco accounted for 3.6 per cent of household spending, 8.0
per cent went on furniture and household equipment, 9.9 per cent on
recreation and education and other goods and services accounted for 8.2 per
cent.
Norwegians rank clergymen at the top of a ranking list of professional
groups when it comes to credibility and high ethical standards. A recent
poll suggested they scored 57 points followed by nurses with 51; doctors
with 46 and policemen with 37. Advertisers are regarded as the most
unreliable and dishonest group of all with only 1 point but car salesmen (2
points), journalists (3) and politicians (4) come just behind.
Five out of 10 Norwegians believe in God and life after death, but seven out
of 10 do not believe in the devil or in hell. Two out of 10 pray to God at
least once a day, while 38 per cent of Norwegians do not pray at all. An
estimated 15 per cent of the population have contact with the church and
Christian life, though seven out of 10 have great doubt and religious
uncertainty.
As many as 77 per cent of Norwegians thought it was possible to be a good
Christian without going to church or chapel.
The Cold War may be over but most Norwegians are in favour of a strong
defence for their country. As many as 86 per cent polled recently said they
were in favour of national defence compared with 81 per cent in 1991. Even
82 per cent of young people aged between 15 and 19 believe this, with strong
support on the far left of Norwegian politics as well.
Norwegians are drinking less alcohol than they used to. There was a 2.3 per
cent fall in consumption last year, part of a downward trend that began in
1988. The average consumption of spirits among all Norwegians over 15 years
old was 4.9 litres of pure alcohol per year. Norwegians spent Dollars 4bn on
alcoholic beverages last year.
Only 95,000 jobs have been created in Norway over the last 10 years and
75,000 of them are in managerial positions, according to the Central Bureau
of Statistics. In 1981 only 4 per cent of female workers had management
positions and 25 per cent of men were in managerial positions. Now 29 per
cent of men are in that position and 10 per cent of women.

Norgeskreditt
</HEADLINE>

NORGESKREDITT AS, the Norwegian private sector mortgage company, is at least
one financial institution in the country that has not become a burden on the
taxpayer. Indeed, it appears to have survived the prolonged crisis that has
troubled the financial system ever since 1986.
In the first quarter of the year it made an operating profit of NKr26.9m and
in 1991 it achieved a NKr100m operating profit, which represented a 15.7 per
cent improvement on the previous year. 'We are running a surplus and we
always have done', says Mr Trond Wennberg, the company's managing director
who has been in charge for the past five years.
Norgeskreditt has not been spared credit losses from bad loans but by
comparison with Norway's commercial banks it has emerged relatively
unscathed and has not required any outside assistance either from the state
or other financial institutions. Identified and estimated losses on loans
totalled NKr9.3m for the first quarter of 1992 while last year losses
amounted to NKr51.3m, of which just under half represented net realised
losses.
Losses on loans last year amounted to 0.23 per cent of assets and to 0.17
per cent for the first three months of this year. Total defaulted loans
after loss provisions amounted to a book principal amount of NKr96m at the
end of last year. The aggregated principal on loans of more than 90 days in
arrears totalled NKr160.8m at the end of March.
At the end of last year Norgeskreditt had assets totalling NKr21.256bn with
a loan portfolio distributed among 3,650 customers across Norway. With a
capital base of NKr1.732.8bn at the end of March and an equity ratio of 9.7
per cent it looks to be in a strong financial position.
Mr Wennberg is in doubt why the company has not run into the troubles
familiar to so many financial institutions in Norway at the moment. 'We
stuck to the conservative way of running a bank,' he explains.
'Norgeskreditt is old fashioned'.
At a time when others were rushing into real estate the company held back.
This meant a loss of market share but the competitive pressures did not push
Norgeskreditt into a policy it did not want to follow.
Its lending business is aimed primarily at medium and long-term loans to
industry and commerce against adequate security. Norgeskreditt insists that
loans have to be secured by first priority mortgages within 60 per cent and
40 per cent of the assessed value or basis of valuation established by its
board for the property for both real estate and operating assets. Loans for
offices, commercial premises, the public sector and housing may be secured
up to 70 per cent of the same. It is the company's policy that loans should
never exceed the liquidation value. Last year 95.1 per cent (NKr18.514bn) of
all gross lending was to the business and public sectors and only 4.9 per
cent (NKr950m) to private housing.
In January this year Norgeskreditt decided to become a limited company, an
application that was accepted by the Ministry of Finance two months later.
This move represents a response to the greater competitiveness resulting
from the liberalisation of the Norwegian financial system. As the company
explains in its prospectus to its NKr750m share offer at NKr100 per share:
'A situation has been created characterised by increased competition where
the ability of individual financial institutions to raise equity capital on
favourable terms will be one of the decisive factors.'
By becoming a limited company Norgeskreditt is in a much better position to
raise equity capital more efficiently. Moreover, with the arrival at the end
of this year of the more stringent capital adequacy requirements under the
rules of the Basle-based Bank for International Settlements (BIS), it will
be possible to fulfil them with a good margin by becoming a limited company.
'Now we are getting more aggressive,' says Mr Wennberg. Norgeskreditt
accounts for 22.1 per cent of the gross lendings of the country's mortgage
institutions. By pursuing prudent policies when others were seduced by the
frenetic atmosphere of the mid-1980s the company has the strength for
expansion.
At a time of so much uncertainty and pessimism it appears to have good
reason for quiet celebration.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (9): Heading the right way - Industry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MR TERJE OSMUNDSEN, the deputy head of the Norwegian employers federation,
NHO, is highly optimist about his country's future. 'Norway is in much
better shape than the statistics might suggest,' he argues.
A highly articulate and persuasive champion of Norwegian mainland business,
he believes the country is heading in the right direction as it becomes more
market and internationally-minded.
Later this year, a study will be published on Norwegian industry, based on
Professor Michael Porter's theory of competitive advantage, and it is clear
already from the work done that Norway has much greater entrepreneurial
potential than might have been expected.
'Our oil and gas revenues are accelerating our transformation towards a
society of high technology and knowledge-based industries,' argues Mr
Osmundsen. 'In the last few years there has been a significant change in the
business climate, with a shift away from traditional welfare policies
towards industrial growth.'
He praises the minority Labour government for helping to stimulate the new
environment and the reform in Norway's corporate taxation which came into
force at the beginning of this year. This has cut the rate from 50.8 per
cent to 28 per cent. The marginal rate of personal taxation has been reduced
from 57 per cent to 48.8 per cent. As a proportion of gross domestic
product, personal taxation is down this year to 11.4 per cent from 12.5 per
cent and now lies around the OECD average.
Unlike many other western economies, Norway has a low level of tax burdens
on employers pay rolls. That contribution is only 16.7 per cent, compared
with 22.9 per cent as a European Community average. The net decline in
Norway's tax revenue amounts to NKr5.6bn this year, equivalent to 1 per cent
of mainland Norway's gross domestic product. As a proportion of total gross
national product Norway's total taxes amount to 44.2 per cent this year
which is 1.3 per cent lower than in 1991, and compare with the EC average of
39.9 per cent.
The modification in the output levels of carbon dioxide to bring it more
into line with the European average is also welcomed by Mr Osmundsen as a
sign that the government recognises it must respond positively to industry's
needs.
He also points to the government's greater readiness to finance profitable
infrastructure projects which make market sense, rather than meet the
political demands of regional policy, its decision to increase funding for
research and development, and to educational changes designed to encourage a
more skilled labour force.
NHO is not completely satisfied. It continues to worry about Norway's large
public sector and industrial costs, but the outlook is more promising than a
few years ago. Mr Osmundsen praises the trade unions for their responsible
attitude in pay bargaining which has helped to restore some lost
competitiveness to Norwegian companies. 'This has been an encouraging sign.
There are also signs that people are working harder,' he argues.
NHO is hopeful that Norway will benefit from its membership of the European
Economic Area from January 1993. Mr Osmundsen points out that much industry
is integrated into European markets and its increasing specialisation among
small and medium-sized enterprises in niches such as information technology
and shipping equipment should give Norwegian industry favourable
opportunities.
'Of course, we do have some sizeable problems,' he admits. 'Too many of our
companies are still too concentrated on the home market, and they have not
devoted enough of their resources to management training.'
Mr Osmundsen is also concerned at the knock-on effects of Norway's long and
deep banking crisis. The larger companies still have no difficulties in
funding their activities when necessary, but the tougher disciplines being
imposed on the banks are making it much harder for smaller enterprises to
acquire necessary capital except at exorbitantly high interest rates.
This autumn the government will unveil its proposals to abolish the
country's so-called concessionary laws that inhibit foreign ownership of
Norwegian industry, agriculture and property. It seems unlikely there will
be complete freedom in this sensitive area, but Norway will have to adjust
as part of its membership of the EEA over a two-year transition period. As
Mr Osmundsen points out, foreign companies are well based in Norway. About
30 per cent of shares on the Oslo bourse are owned by foreigners and
companies such as Asea Brown-Boveri, Alcatel and Siemens have successful
activities inside the country.
However, Norway needs a much larger flow of inward industrial investment in
the coming years which is why NHO is so favourable to the country's early
membership of the European Community. 'We need a cultural change,' declares
Mr Osmundsen. 'More companies must get into exports and find partners
abroad.'
The government may have helped to stimulate a more favourable climate for
industry but this does not mean automatic success after a long period of
decline and weakness. The restructuring of mainland industry has been slow
and painful. Mr Osmundsen believes the challenge now facing the business
community is to make a 'more aggressive response'. 'Our industrial base is
smaller now than it was a few years ago but it is also healthier.'

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (8): Given higher priority - The
Environment
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
MRS Gro Harlem Brundtland may have lacked the panache or effrontery of
Cuba's Fidel Castro at the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro but the Norwegian
prime minister was well received by delegates for her knowledgeable
contribution to the discussion. Here at least is one western democratic
leader who seems to be in tune with the feelings of the developing nations
over the future of the global environment.
As the head of an international commission investigating the subject in the
early 1980s she was one of the few politicians with a claim to know
something about the subject beyond the cloudy platitudes and cliches that
tend to dominate too much of the global environmental debate.
It has also ensured that the Norwegian government gives a much higher
priority to environmental issues than most others among western market
economies. Parliament recently agreed to introduce a new article into
Norway's constitution which grants everybody the right to a health and
sustainable environment. Such a gesture may seem rather meaningless to many
people but at least it focuses national attention on a subject that has been
neglected for far too long.
As a small country, Norway is only responsible for an estimated 0.1 per cent
of global emissions and its total share of world greenhouse gas emissions is
less than 0.1 per cent. During the late 1980's annual emission of greenhouse
gases amounted to about 2.6 tons per capita, lower than any other OECD
country except for Turkey. But as this year's OECD report on Norway
indicated the rate of greenhouse gas emissions was growing at a faster rate
than most industrialised countries, particularly those of nitrogen oxides.
However, as the OECD study made clear: 'The pattern of greenhouse gas
emissions in Norway can be largely explained by the country's geographic
conditions'.
Carbon dioxide emissions are low because most of Norway's electricity
generation comes from environmentally friendly hydro-power. But as a large
producer and exporter of petroleum responsible for world carbon dioxide
emissions, Norway in the words of OECD 'makes it very susceptible to global
policy decisions in this area'. The high level of nitrogen oxides in the
atmosphere is due to coastal shipping transport and the fishing industry.
What environmental pollution there is in Norway is caused by the industries
of other countries, such as acid rain which comes from coal-burning plants
particularly in Britain, Germany and eastern Europe. Only an estimated 5 per
cent of the sulphur oxide deposited over Norway comes from Norwegian
emissions.
The extent of the damage this has caused to Norway has been quantified
recently. The pollution of inland waters which has affected fish catch
levels is calculated to cost between NKr530m-NKr610m annually, 0.1 cent of
the country's GDP. The annual yield of timber lost as a result of acid rain
amounts to between Kr330m-NKr650m while the annual damage caused by sulphur
dioxide on fixed capital totals Nkr440m.
Norway does not devote much of its resources to pollution control, at least
to judge by the latest comparative OECD data which showed it amounted to 0.8
per cent of gross domestic product compared with 1.5 per cent in the US and
1.3 per cent in Britain.
The government has committed the country to pollution reduction targets that
are better than the agreed international standards. It is pledged to halve
emissions of sulphur dioxide by next year from their 1980 level and reduce
nitrogen dioxide emissions by 30 per cent by 1998 from a base line figure
for 1986. There is a national target of stabilising carbon dioxide emissions
at the 1989 level by 2000 and a rapid phase out of halons and CFC's -
manmade chemicals.
Norway has agreed to reduce water pollution by 1995 with a halving in
micropollutants compared with 1985 , a 70 per cent cut in cadmium, mercury,
lead and dioxins and a 50 per cent reduction in emissions of nutrients such
as nitrates and phosphates. It is closely involved in schemes to reduce
pollution in neighbouring regions such as the Kola peninsula of Russia where
nickel producing plants are an environmental problem. It has been estimated
that NKr300m is being spent over the next five years in total transfers for
the Kola project.
Moves inside Norway to encourage better treatment of the environment in the
past have been based on regulatory controls. But in last year's budget there
was a switch in policy to the use of the tax system to improve the country's
environment and not just raise revenues for the government by making it
financially advantageous for polluters to take action to reduce their costs.
This year, the budget increased the new 1991 tax imposed on carbon dioxide
emissions while the tax on mineral oil was pushed up from 65 per cent to 90
per cent and the petrol tax by 25 per cent or 12 US cents per litre for
leaded petrol.
Norway's environment is likely to be improved most through international
action to reduce emissions from its more industrial neighbours to the south.
This ought to be a powerful argument for those Norwegians who want their
country to join the EC.
Strangely enough, a large number of those who want to give a clean
environment the top priority are hostile to the EC. But to be green in one
country is an illusion as Mrs Brundtland can tell them.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (6): Two main arguments of the anti-EC camp
 -Agriculture and Fish
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
AGRICULTURE and fishing arouse deep passion in Norway. Fears about losing
autonomy in these industries are among the main reasons why Norway narrowly
rejected membership of the European Community in a bitterly divisive
referendum two decades ago.
Farming and fishing remain the two main arguments of the anti-EC movement in
Norway. It argues that the country should remain outside the Community in
spite of the fact that Nordic cousins Sweden and Finland have applied for
membership.
Both industries are used as policy instruments to maintain a settlement
distribution in remote areas of the country and both are the most subsidised
Norwegian industry.
Mrs Gro Harlem Brundtland, Norway's prime minister making a pro-market
speech warned: 'The Labour party has important principles to defend in the
new agricultural policy that will be devised. Agricultural activites shall
be spread throughout the country; and those engaged in agriculture shall not
have a lower standard of living than the rest of the population.
'We realise that others take a different view of this. Many advocate
concentrating our efforts on achieving the most efficient agricultural
sector possible, and letting the more vulnerable districts fend for
themselves. This is unacceptable to us.'
Few outsiders realise the great expanse of Norway. One way to gain a
perspective is to turn a map of Norway around - reverse north and south on a
pivot - and you will find, surprisingly, that the north would stretch far
down into the Mediterranean reaches of Italy.
Norway's area is 324 sq kms, and the western coastline is over 2,000 kms
long. On one hand, fishing is Norway's most international industry - outside
petroleum - with 90 per cent of the catch exported - 60 per cent to Europe.
Fishing off the coast and in distant icey waters has always been important
to Norway which, until recent times, was one of the world's leading fishing
nations.
Fishing accounts for about 7 per cent of gross domestic product. Farming, on
the other hand, employs less than 7 per cent of the country's workforce and
is meant to make Norway as self-sufficient as possible in food production,
provide outlying rural areas with employment while matching farm incomes to
those of the average blue-collar worker.
Lavish subsidies, in the range of NKr12bn of annual state transfers, have
supported this policy in recent years.
Only 3 per cent to 4 per cent of Norway's land mass is cultivable, about
9,000 sq kms, and most grain is imported. Farming meets the demand for milk,
cheese and meat and some of this produce is exported, but generally at an
economic loss.
In 1990, total turnover of the 16 agriculture co-operatives was NKr34bn, a
2.5 per cent growth over the previous year. About one-half of Norway's
farmers are dairy farmers and are situated in extreme outlying rural areas.
About 20 per cent of Norway's municipalities have more than 25 per cent of
the working force employed as farmers. But there has been on average, a
reduction in the number of farms of about 3,000 a year since the 1950s.
About 60 per cent of Norway's farmers have the main part of their annual
income from farming but all have second jobs.
The odd side of Norway's farming picture is that the country still imports
about one-half of consumption and it is the one area in which there has been
no Nordic co-ordination of policy nor co-operation in production.
However, Norway's agriculture policy is about to undergo reform. Last year a
white paper suggesting the direction of the reform and pinpointing measures
was meant to be presented in parliament but was postponed by the delay in
the Gatt and Uruguay Round negotiations. It will be further postponed until
agreement on these two international issues is achieved.
However, the minority Labour government is hell bent on presenting some sort
of white paper on policy this autumn, although it is disappointed that it
will not be as far-reaching as it had intended.
Earlier this year, Ms Gunhild Oeyangen, Norway's tough, no-nonsense
agriculture minister, told OECD delegates that bringing Norway's agriculture
reform process to its natural conclusion was necessary.
Ms Oeyangen conceeds that to achieve success in the reform process, policy
will have to be broad. 'We must not focus simply and entirely upon the
economic gains to be achieved through reducing subsidies and liberalising
trade, even if this is of substantial importance,' she warned.
Agriculture's role is likely to always remain a priority as it upholds
traditions and cultural heritage while supporting rural communities.
She told OECD delegates that agriculture was strongly decentralised, and
thereby provided an important and independent element in the development of
more diversified economic basis in rural areas.
In a far-reaching report, the OECD urged Norway to revamp is agriculture
policy to become more market oriented and less insulated. It said that the
total price and subsidy assistance to Norway's agriculture sector, in
relation to the value of production, was the highest of all OECD countries.
The OECD argued that Norway's agriculture policy's multiple objectives -
security of food supplies, equitable farm incomes, regional development,
environmental preservation and economic efficiency - were hard to reconcile.
The OECD calculated that subsidies measured as the net total producer
subsidy equivalent (PSE) more than doubled from NKr8.1bn to NKr17.2bn
between 1979 and 1988.
About half of total subsidies - those supported by high producer prices
which are sustained by strict import barriers for most commodities - came
from direct payments, including deficiency payments to shelter domestic
production from world markets.
The burden falls on consumers, whose support to the sector rose four-fold to
nearly NKr9bn, as the tax they paid on farm production more than doubled to
63 per cent by 1988.
A government-appointed committee urged a two-thirds reduction in support to
farms and a realignment of agricuture policy to become market-oriented. In
the last couple of years more than 100,000 farmers received more than 100
price support measures.
However, the report warned that in remote areas of Norway a necessary level
of government support should be maintained and that measures should continue
to restrict imports of agriculture products to a level that would secure the
furture of Norway's farming industry to ensure adequate food supplies.
The government admitted that the report initiated an important debate over
its excessive agriculture support and helped identify structural problems of
the sector.
Nevertheless, Norway believes that it has special problems relating to its
agriculture sector - which it calls arctic farming - and should it join the
EC, would benefit from negotiating terms and conditions for this sector
together with Finland which it says has a similar uniqueness.
Norway's potential as an agriculture producer is far from being utilised and
farm operations could easily be stepped up. Norway has no shortage of
produce but over-production remains a concern of future farm policy.

NORWAY this year overtook Britain as western Europe's biggest oil producer.
Daily production exceeded 2m barrels and has remained at or slightly above
this level.
More than one-half of western Europe's remaining proven oil and natural gas
reserves are found on the Norwegian continental shelf (NCS). According to
the Norwegian Petroleum Directorate (NPD), the energy watchdog, discovered
and recoverable NCS reserves stood at 5.3bn tonnes of oil equivalent (t o e)
at the end of last year. Of the total, 40 per cent is said to be oil and 60
per cent gas.
The NPD estimates that at current production rates, these reserves are
enough to allow oil production for the next 17 years and gas production over
the next 111 years. If 'enhanced petroleum recovery' technology is utilised,
the NPD believes that these time horizons could be doubled.
In addition to discovered reserves, the NPD reckons that 'undiscovered but
likely-to be-found' reserves comprise 3.5bn t o e of which 30 per cent is
believed to be oil and 70 per cent is thought to be gas.
Exports of oil and gas account for more than one-third of Norway's total
exports and petroleum activity this year will account for more than 15 per
cent of the gross national product (GNP). In 1991 Norway's petroleum
industry employed more than 63,000 workers.
Norway is ranked eighth in the world league of oil producers and is the
biggest crude oil exporter outside the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting
Countries (Opec).
Exports of natural gas meet more than 10 per cent of western European demand
and account for 25 per cent of the Community's gas imports. Contracted gas
will see annual gas sales expand to 45bn cubic metres (bcm) by 1999 from
about 28 bcm today but, with the green environmental wave sweeping Europe
gas exports could swell significantly higher. Gas is considered a much
cleaner alternative to coal in power generation.
Last year Statoil, the Norwegian state oil company, placed contracts worth
more than NKr21bn with the petroleum service industry but total industry
contracted expenditure was close to NKr32bn, with Norwegian companies
gaining about 60 per cent of the business.
At a time when it is argued by many that oil has lost its prime spot on the
world political agenda, Norway refutes this in the promotion of what it
calls 'global energy policy inter-relationships'. For Norway this is an
important foreign policy objective, since oil continues to influence and be
influenced by international politics, it argues.
The country sees as one of its main foreign policy tasks to not only promote
but also stimulate a global energy dialogue. 'Within the IEA (International
Energy Agency) Norway has emphasised the need to pursue a more long-term
foreign policy endeavour to build confidence and dismantle confrontational
attitudes between oil-exporting and oil-importing countries,' says Mr Arne
Walther head of the energy section at the foreign ministry.
'Long-term security of oil supply can be promoted by more orderly relations
and greater mutual understanding between oil-exporting and oil-importing
countries.'
For example, when the oil price plunged below Dollars 8 a barrel in 1985-86,
Norway helped Opec prop up prices by implementing a 7.5 per cent
self-imposed production restraint. The support was unilateral in form and
limited in time.
Opec this year appealed to Norway to reinstate a production restraint policy
but this time it was spurned.
During Iraq's invasion of Kuwait last year, Norway within the IEA helped
form a contingency plan which aimed to secure energy supplies and weaken an
expected dramatic rise in oil prices. 'The Gulf crisis underscored the close
relationship between energy and political power and confirmed a community of
interests in avoiding excessive volatility in the oil market and in securing
the supply of oil,' Mr Walther says.
In keeping with these political efforts, Norway last month hosted a meeting
of IPEC (Independent Petroleum Exporting Countries) and next month will host
a workshop of governmental leaders, at ministerial level, in which 20
countries are expected to exchange information and policy views to promote
common understanding of common energy-related problems.
According to a report by Edinburgh-based analyst County NatWest WoodMac
(CNWM) the state, through direct financial investment, owns 44 per cent of
all petroleum reserves, 44 per cent of commercial reserves and 42.5 per cent
of technical reserves. In addition, the state owns 28 per cent of total
production for the 1992-95 period and holds 41 per cent of the total
licensed acreage.
The report estimates 1992-95 average daily production at 2.128m barrels of
oil, 132,000 barrels of natural gas liquids and 2.948m cubic feet of natural
gas. it says Statoil, Norsk Hydro and Saga Petroleum, the three Norwegian
oil companies, control more petroleum reserves than the combined 10 European
companies or seven US companies operating in Norway.
The Norwegian companies own 25 per cent of the commercial reserves, 25 per
cent of the technical reserves, 29 per cent of total production in the
period 1992-95 and hold 23 per cent of total acreage awarded, says CNWM.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (4): Riding the crest of a wave - Politics:
Centre Party on the move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Centre Party is riding on the crest of an electoral popularity it has
never known before. In the latest IMM opinion poll earlier this month it
secured 14.9 per cent support, the biggest rating recorded in the party's
history.
This is even better than the 12.1 per cent the Centre Party won in last
September's local government elections. If repeated at next year's general
election the Centre would at least double its 11 seats in Parliament and
this would provide the party with a formidable blocking force.
Mrs Anne Enger Lahnstein, the party's young leader, is in no doubt why the
Centre is doing so well. 'We are the main anti-EC force in Norway,' she
argues. A good deal of her time is spent campaigning around the country
against what she sees as the threat of an over-mighty European state to
Norwegian independence.
'I am an internationalist and I don't want to isolate Norway,' she insists.
'I support our membership of the United Nations and of Nato. I favour closer
co-operation with Europe on issues like the environment. But I do not
believe decisions affecting our lives should be taken by bureaucrats in
Brussels. We are a small, special country and we must make the decisions
that affect our lives.'
However, Mrs Lahnstein is not just opposed to any suggestion that Norway
should seek EC membership. Mrs Lahnstein is hostile to Norway"s
participation in the European Economic Area EEA. She intends to fight all
the way against ratification of the EEA agreement that is expected to win a
clear majority in Parliament in September and will not be subject to a
national referendum.
Pointing to the bulky volumes of EEA rules and regulations Norway piled on
her office table, she asserts that the people do not realise what is going
on in their name. 'I am not giving up hope we can prevent it,' she declares.
At times Mrs Lahstein can sound far to the left in her denunciation of what
she calls the dominance of money power in the EC. But she is sensitive to
any suggestion that the Centre Party might collaborate more closely in a
joint anti-EC campaign with the populist Socialist Left party which is doing
well in opinion surveys at the moment.
In fact, there is little doubt that Mrs Lahnstein's gut feelings are more
sympathetic to Labour than the Conservatives. After all it was her
mobilising of the centre parliamentary group in October 1990 that signalled
the downfall of the right-centre government of Mr Jan Syse that held power
for just over a year. Mrs Lahnstein says the moment had come to put a stop
to the government's efforts to create the European Economic Area.
Her view carried the day and the Centre Party was forced to leave the
coalition. It was thanks to Mrs Lahnstein's efforts that the party went on
to accept that it should support the return of Mrs Brundtland to office at
the head of a minority Labour government.
The fact that Mrs Brundtland is as pro-EC as Mr Syse was does not appear to
bother Mrs Lahnstein who remains an admirer of the prime minister. After
all, she points out, the Centre Party is at least free of any association
with a pro-EC policy in government and as a result is building up a larger
electoral mass base.
The Centre Party was founded in 1920. In Norway, like others of the same
name in the Nordic region, it was for a long time little more than a
pressure group for farmers and fishermen. Its main pockets of support still
come from the central rural areas of the country. But the party is
attracting voters from a much wider spectrum because of its robust line on
Europe. Mrs Lahnstein, who has a seat for Oslo, argues that the party's
organisation can hardly keep pace with the influx of new recruits.
In her opinion the Centre has been helped by a revival in Norway of older
values. 'I think that around the mid-1980s there would have been much less
opposition here to joining the EC at a time when people were more concerned
with money and materialism,' she argues. 'The recession in 1986 and the bank
crisis have made many Norwegians think again. Now there is much more hard
work and a belief that we should take care of each other.'
Mrs Lahnstein wants to put people and the environment before economics. She
believes Norway will lose its gentle and comfortable way of life if it joins
the EC. Her feelings reflect the widening gender gap - noticeable elsewhere
in the Nordic region - with a large majority of women opposed to the EC
compared with men.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (5): Doubts about the EC - Foreign Affairs
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE Labour government is preparing itself for what looks like being a real
and protracted struggle to win over hostile public opinion to the idea of
the country joining the European Community. The case for Norwegian entry has
so far gone by default, leaving the anti-EC forces free to propagate their
opposition but this is about to change.
Mrs Brundtland and her cabinet colleagues intend to launch a united campaign
of persuasion with the Labour party as their organisational base which will
stress in particular the political case for Norwegian EC membership.
Ministers will argue that the country must join the EC to further the future
stability of Europe.
'I believe we have only a limited period of opportunity in which to achieve
an integrated European co-operation,' argues Mr Thorvald Stoltenburg,
Norway's experienced foreign minister. 'If we don"t achieve that now I fear
we could go back to the Europe of the 1930s. The issue is about the peace of
our continent.'
In his opinion the government has not been good in selling the concept of EC
membership. But he believes confidently that there will not be a no vote, as
in 1972, when Norway holds its referendum on the EC issue after the
completion of entry negotiations. 'I trust the Norwegians,' declares Mr
Stoltenburg. Certainly Norway has not been reluctant in the recent past to
play a full part in organisations that extend beyond the nation state.
Norway, unlike its Nordic neighbours to the east, has believed, at least
since its occupation by the Nazis in the Second World War, on the need for
collective security for its own defence. It was a founder member of Nato,
and it continues to recognise that its defence can only be guaranteed
through close co-operation with others.
This is why Norway is looking favourably on the idea of joining the Western
European Union perhaps to begin with as an associate member. But ministers
believe it would find no difficulty at all in playing a full part in the
development of any common foreign and defence policy that emerges inside the
EC. 'The dynamism of Europe is making it very risky for us to stay outside
the EC,' argues Mr Johan Jorgen Holst, Norway's defence minister for 5 1/2
years. 'Since the war the country's security has been assured by being in
Nato but this could be changing. Membership of the EC looks like becoming
all important for our own defence.'
This does not mean that Norwegian policy makers see any defence alternative
to Nato emerging in the foreseeable future inside the EC. Moreover Mr Holst
insists that his country needs an Atlantic framework for its defence and the
US will remain the only country that could provide that.
As the only Nato member with a land border with Russia, Norway is ever
conscious of its strategic position. The end of the Cold War between east
and west and collapse of the Soviet Union may have eased tensions in the
northern European security area but the Norwegian government is still
keeping a wary eye on its relations with Moscow. 'Russia is no longer the
single largest military power in central Europe but it is in the north,'
explains Mr Holst. The large naval and nuclear facilities remain in the
Murmansk region with access to the seas of the north.
Some policy makers in Oslo worry about some form of military takeover in
Moscow which could pave the way for the creation of an ultra-nationalistic
and authoritarian regime with territorial ambitions.
'The situation in Russia is clearly very volatile,' argues Mr Holst who
points out that the chauvinistic Mr Vladimar Zhirinovsky polled over 40 per
cent of the vote in the Soviet armed services dominated Kola peninsula in
last summer's Russian presidential election. 'The peace dividend is at the
level of political atmospherics rather than in a reduction in military
capacities,' he adds.
On the other hand, Mr Stoltenburg is confident that negotiations with Russia
over its territorial boundary line with Norway through the Barent Sea will
be completed shortly, after a long period of dispute that clouded relations
between the two countries even during the Gorbachov era.
Ministers hope that northern Europe will remain a quiet corner of the
continent but they are not taking it for granted. The level of Norway's
defence spending remains relatively high, though cut back by 1 per cent from
the 3 per cent annual growth achieved in real terms during the 1980s in
spite of the changes in the east and the pressures on government spending
due to the country's weak economy.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (3): Cautious optimism for this year -
Banking and Finance
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AFTER five years of disastrous results, Norway's banking sector, which is
struggling to recover from Europe's worst post-war financial crisis, sees
cautious optimism over the prospects for this year.
In the first quarter, the 23 commercial banks' aggregate operating losses
shrunk to 0.9 per cent of total assets from 1.24 per cent in the same period
last year. The banks' first-quarter operating profit rose 32.4 per cent to
NKr1.205bn from NKr910m.
Combined credit losses retracted by 18.4 per cent to NKr2.071bn from
NKr2.54bn, leading to an aggregate 46.6 per cent advance in pre-tax profit.
A reduction in credit losses is the single biggest factor contributing to
the commercial banks' first quarter improvement.
Aggregate net interest earnings in the period rose 4.6 per cent to
NKr2.566bn from NKr2.453bn, while operating costs were cut by 8.2 per cent
to NKr2.662bn from NKr2.866bn, benefiting from a 24 per cent reduction in
staffing over the past four years.
Central bank figures show that the volume of non-performing loans was
reduced to NKr15.3bn by the end of the first quarter from NKr19.1bn just
three months earlier. Recent reports point out that in the last year,
Norway's four biggest banks - Den norske Bank (DnB), Christiania Bank, Fokus
Bank and Sparebanken Nor - reduced combined assets by NKr90bn, mostly
through big reductions in loan volume.
Since 1987, the commercial banks have suffered almost NKr40bn in credit
losses. 1991 was the worst year ever when they reached NKr14.2bn. However,
more recent trends suggest they may end the year roughly in balance,
according to the central bank.
Last autumn, the government was forced to intervene to prop up the banks by
injecting NKr15.5bn of taxpayers' money into their empty coffers as a result
of equity capital either being wiped out or nearly erased by credit losses
and a plunge in the value of collateral - mainly real estate - for loans. In
Oslo, property values are said to have fallen by 35 per cent in the past
four years.
Although estimates vary, as a result of the rescue action, the state is the
dominant shareholder in the banking system with ownership of between 50 per
cent and 70 per cent. As Mr Hermod Skaanland, the central bank governor, put
it in his annual address to the business and political community: 'Stability
has been restored, but the (banking) crisis will remain unresolved until the
banks are in a position to raise capital in the private market on normal
market terms.'
But the government and the central bank agree that it is too early even to
raise the issue of reprivatising Christiania Bank and Fokus Bank. 'Although
in many respects it is desired to bring in private owners, it is too early
to fix a strategy for privatisation,' the government said in last month's
revised national budget for 1992. 'Privatisation can first occur when the
value of the banks can be fixed with more certainty than there is today,' it
added.
The government has rejected a scheme to help revive the banks in which their
bad loans would be transferred to a bank established by the state  - a
so-called bad loan bank. 'The (finance) ministry will not support the
establishment of a state finance institution which buys bad engagements from
the banking sector.'
However, Mr Svein Oeygaard, the finance secretary, said recently that the
government might consider proposals by individual banks to establish their
own subsidiaries into which they could offload non-performing loans.
In the revised budget, the government proposed a plan to help the banks
further. It would allow so-called 'unspecified loan loss reserves' during a
transitional period to qualify as tier capital. Tier capital is the banks'
supplementary capital, plus equity, subordinated capital and core capital,
under the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) capital adequacy rules.
This allowance alone could curb the banks' need for state support this year,
which was estimated by the government to be NKr3.4bn at end-1991. At the end
of last year, the commercial banks had an aggregate capital adequacy of 7.1
per cent in relation to risk-weighted assets, helped by state transfers. By
comparison, before state cash transfers, at the end of last year's third
quarter, the figure was merely 4.6 per cent.
The banks are not the only finance sector concerned. According to the
finance ministry, the aggregate operating profits of the insurance companies
last year halved to NKr2.8bn due to lower financial income caused by stock
market weakness and losses in the value of bank shareholdings and bonds.
At the end of last year the Oslo stock exchange All-share index was 9.4 per
cent below the level of 1990.
The index declined throughout 1991 and bank shares saw an 80 per cent plunge
in market value. At the same time, the insurance companies' costs escalated,
but credit losses comprised just 0.3 per cent of total loans (an estimated
NKr200m).
By comparison, the commercial banks' aggregate credit losses comprised 5.3
per cent of loans and savings banks 2.6 per cent.
In what could be described as a purging process, later this year a
government-appointed commission will issue a far-reaching report on the
causes behind Norway's bank crisis.
In the meantime, a government-funded study of the crisis, led by Professor
Torger Reve of the Bergen-based Norwegian School of Economics, Business and
Administration, has concluded that, following deregulation, the banks lack
competitive experience and have pursued growth strategies which increase
their risk exposure, resulting in substantial credit losses.
The report emphasised the problems experienced by the banking sector in
converting from a regulated to a market-based system.
The banks expanded their total volume of loans from just over NKr110bn in
1984 to just under NKr300bn by 1990, it said.
In this expansion, many of the banks never realised profits from basic
banking but made gains from non-banking activities such as foreign currency
trading and stock market investments.
'The banking crisis which most observers thought was over in 1989-90 has
reached its worst years ever in 1991-92. The crisis goes beyond being a
banking crisis, and it is more correct to talk about a breakdown of the
whole financial system,' said Prof Reve's far-reaching report.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (2): It all depends on oil - The Economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KAREN FOSSLI
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY'S vast petroleum resources are both a blessing and a curse for the
economy. To say that the discovery of oil two decades ago has had a profound
impact on its structure would be a gross understatement.
One has only to look at this year's massive budget deficit to appreciate
Norway's extreme addiction to petroleum revenue or reflect on an earlier
economic downfall caused by plunging petrol prices.
Including petroleum revenue, this year's budget deficit stretches to
NKr39.9bn, allowing the minority Labour government to pursue an
ever-expansive economic policy aimed at shoring up the sags in the social
welfare system. Excluding petroleum, the deficit swells to a new record
NKr71.1bn.
Luckily, petrol production will grow by over 20 per cent to 1996 from a
current level of slightly more than 2m barrels per day. Thereafter, the main
reliance on oil revenue will begin to shift to one on revenue from natural
gas sales as oil production begins a steady decline to the year 2000.
It is only recently - since the green wave of environmental concern swept
Europe - that natural gas's future has brightened with the prospect of
conversion to gas-fired power generation from coal-fired power generation.
Even so, Norway has done nothing to protect itself against the possibility
of plunging oil prices. Official estimates indicate that a fall in the oil
price of just Dollars 1 a barrel weakens Norway's petroleum wealth by more
than Dollars 20bn, or by about 25 per cent of mainland gross domestic
product.
This means that the value of petroleum resources would become negligible if
the oil price plunges below Dollars 10 a barrel, as it did in 1986. With the
oil price at Dollars 18 a barrel, new oil and gas field developments from
about the first quarter of the next century would have to be postponed to
avoid large losses on investment.
It is only when petroleum prices exceed extraction costs that the economy
derives a windfall gain - and Norway's petroleum extraction costs are among
the highest in the world. So far this year, oil prices have struggled to
maintain a level of about Dollars 19 a barrel, and many international oil
companies do not foresee a change in this level over the next few years.
Norway's petroleum wealth has an estimated net present value of NKr710bn,
with the state's share put at NKr580bn, yielding an estimated return on
investment of NKr41bn in 1992.
When world crude oil prices fell to Dollars 8 a barrel in 1985-86, a severe
blow was delivered to the economy - which was already in a state of acute
over-heating - from which it has not yet recovered. Norway was forced to
devalue by 10 per cent to counteract a deterioration in international
competitiveness. The government then set out a three-pronged strategy to
reduce the economy's dependence on petroleum income by seeking to reduce
growth in private and public consumption while stimulating productivity
through supply-side reform.
Reduction in petroleum revenue slashed Norway's spendable real income by 9
per cent as tax and royalties from the sector fell to just over NKr18bn in
1986 from NKr52bn in 1985, or measured in proportion to total income, to 7
per cent from 19 per cent.
Export revenue from the petroleum sector was reduced by NKr30bn,
corresponding to about half the deterioration in the current account from
1985 to 1986.
This reduced the sector's share of gross national product to 11 per cent in
1986 from 19 per cent in 1985, although total petroleum production increased
to 69m tonnes of oil equivalent (t o e) from 64m t o e in the period.
The current account swung from a surplus of 5.5 per cent of GDP to a 6.5 per
cent deficit. Fresh warnings on the oil price for 1992 are emerging -
indeed, in this year's revised budget forecast the government cut
budget-based oil prices to NKr120 from December's NKr131 a barrel. Last
year, oil prices averaged about NKr134, due to windfall effects from the
Gulf war.
Nevertheless, the government revised upwards 1992 GDP growth to 2.9 per cent
from 1.9 per cent predicted in December and sees GDP growth of about 2.5 per
cent until 1996, lifted by rising North Sea oil output.
Overall GDP grew by 1.9 per cent in 1991, down from the 2.6 per cent
forecast earlier by the government. Petroleum production will expand to 129m
t o e this year, up 4m t o e on December's forecast, and will swell further
to 149m t o e by 1996.
But the government revised downwards last year's output to 118m t o e from
the 123m t o e estimated in December, largely because of a maintenance
overhaul causing a longer than expected shutdown of Statfjord, the biggest
oil producing field.
The current account surplus was also revised downwards to NKr26bn from
December's forecast NKr37.3bn, due to the adjustment in forecast oil prices,
but the government believes that net foreign debt may be reduced to zero in
1994.
The budget also revealed weaknesses in the mainland economy, which excludes
petroleum and shipping. Investments in mainland industry are expected to
fall 2 per cent this year and growth has been pared back to 1.5 per cent
from December's 2 per cent forecast. Demand for goods and services, however,
may rise by 2 per cent from 1991-92.
Cost competitiveness has improved by about 10.5 per cent in the past three
years. Also on the bright side, inflation, at 2.5 per cent, is lower than
that of Norway's main trading partners and interest rates have fallen to the
level of most of western Europe.
Households have improved their financial position and debt is being reduced
on a large scale. But, nothing is being done to reduce the economy's
dependency on petroleum income. On the contrary, petroleum earnings have
allowed NKr40bn to be spent since 1988 to stimulate domestic demand. This
year the government has allocated expenditure of NKr2.5bn just to curb
unemployment, which, at 8 per cent, has risen to its highest ever post war
level.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Survey of Norway (1): Divided over union - Norway stands on
the brink of making important decisions about its relationship with the rest
of Europe. However, the country is in a divided mood as it prepares for
union
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ROBERT TAYLOR
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
NORWAY is preparing for covergence with the rest of western Europe but is in
a divided mood. By the end of this year a number of important decisions will
have been taken by the country's politicians which will point the country in
a new direction and take it out of its semi-isolation.
In September, Parliament is expected to back, by a comfortable majority,
Norway's membership of the 19-nation European Economic Area, EEA. From
January 1 1993 the country will then become a part of an integrated free
market stretching from the Arctic to the Mediterranean.
Two months later, the ruling Labour Party at its conference, looks set to
vote decisively in favour of Norway joining the European Community. Mrs Gro
Harlem Brundtland, the indomitable prime minister, will then hand in the
Norwegian membership application before the end of the British EC presidency
in December. This will ensure Norway does not miss inclusion in the process
of enlargement, but lines up with Sweden, Finland and Austria for
negotiations with Brussels.
None of these decisions look like being easy to make. Norway - unlike any
other EC membership aspirant - retains a persistent and sizeable popular
opposition to any moves designed to take the country in the direction of
closer unity and co-operation with western Europe.
There has been a sharp deterioration in national support for Norwegian EC
membership in the aftermath of the Danish referendum rejection of the
Maastricht treaty on June 2, with one poll showing 52 per cent against and
only 36 per cent in favour. In spite of this, Mrs Brundtland intends to
stick firmly to the timetable she devised at least 12 months ago. Her
advisers insist there will be no sudden change of mind on this issue by the
government in the face of the hostile opinion polls.
Since her return to office at the head of a minority Labour government in
October 1990, Mrs Brundtland has come in for a great deal of criticism over
what has been regarded as the slow pace of her strategy towards the EC.
This, it is alleged, has enabled the anti-EC forces to seize the initiative.
Certainly, the prime minister has moved Norway much slower in an EC
direction than its Nordic neighbours.
It was in October 1990 that the Swedish government intimated it wanted to
join the EC and its membership application was handed in last July. In
Finland the conversion to the EC cause of the political establishment was
even more rapid.
Mrs Brundltand's caution does not reflect doubts on her part about whether
or not Norway should join. The prime minister's personal commitment is not
in question, but she faces domestic political difficulties over the issue
which have not been sufficiently appreciated by the outside world.
It is not the first time that Norway has found itself in its present uneasy
position. Twenty years ago a Labour government negotiated the country's EC
entry terms, alongside Britain and Denmark, but in the advisory referendum
called to endorse that membership agreement a clear majority of Norwegians
(53.5 per cent to 46.5 per cent) rejected membership.
The EC question brought a bitterness and division to Norwegian politics that
today's political leaders remember with a shudder and none want to see a
repetition of events that divided families and friends. But it is going to
take a high level of statesmanship and a good deal of luck for Norway to
avoid a return of those emotional feelings during the next few years.
Mrs Brundtland has embarked on a high risk strategy over the EC which could
weaken her party's perilous position in the next general election in
September 1993. The latest public opinion poll showed that the Labour party
this month has reached a record low popularity rating of about 28.7 per
cent. This dismal performance compares with Labour's vote of 34.3 per cent
in the 1989 general election, which was itself the worst result the party
had suffered since 1930, and a derisory 30.4 per cent vote in last
September's local government elections. For a party that has dominated most
of post-war Norwegian politics Labour's standing is very poor.
Some of the government's unpopularity stems from the country's persistent
economic woes, particularly the climbing level of registered unemployment
which is ecpected to climb to nearly 6 per cent by the end of this year.
This figure is a good deal less than in most of western Europe but it is the
highest suffered in Norway for over 60 years and it appears to be damaging
Labour's electoral position.
Because Norway's state finances continue to be propped up by oil and gas
revenues, the government has found it possible to pursue an expansionist
fiscal policy with a 1.3 per cent budget stimulus this year. However, this
seems unlikely to trigger any pre-election consumer boom as many Norwegians
seek to save and reduce the debts they accumulated in the care-free 1980's.
international demand remains too weak to stimulate mainland industrial
investment.
There are some bright economic indicators. Price inflation remains low at
under 3.0 per cent and so do wage settlements while the current account
surplus looks set to rise as Norway becomes a net creditor country by the
mid-1990's. In its spring survey of Norway, the Organisation for Economic
Co-operation and Development suggested that Norway in the short term would
enjoy only a hesitant recovery, mainly because of the lack of a mainland
industrial upturn. It is also worried by the deep and intractable banking
crisis that underlines the fragility of the economy.
However, economic uncertainties are not perhaps the main reason for the
government's unpopularity. Even Labour ministers accept that the party's
attitude towards Europe is costing it dearly with the voters.
In spite of this, Mrs Brundtland is not going to be deflected from her
determination to start negotiations on Norway's EC entry as soon as possible
after November in the hope of short-term gains at the polls. Her position
inside the Labour Party that she has led since 1981 still looks impregnable.
Indeed, to many who are not Labour sympathisers, Mrs Brundtland is seen as
the only Norwegian politician with the strength and ability to govern
effectively.
On the EC issue she reflects majority Labour Party membership opinion. Over
the past nine months a wide-ranging debate has been going on at the party
grassroots on the pros and cons of Norway joining the EC. This culminated
during the spring in votes at Labour's 19 county conferences across the
country with only the four far northern ones coming out against an EC
application.
However, nobody in Oslo is under any illusions about the up-hill struggle
that Mrs Brundtland faces after the end of this year over the EC issue. The
anti-EC forces have built up a formidable head of steam with a clever appeal
to tiny Norway's strong sense of national identity.
The prime minister has resisted the demands for a referendum this autumn on
whether Norway should join the European Economic Area, or on whether the
country should submit an EC membership application to Brussels. But she -
like all the other political leaders - accepts there must be a national
referendum on the entry terms, as in 1972, once they have been negotiated.
Although the result will not be binding, because there is no constitutional
requirement for it, Mrs Brundtland has made it clear she would accept the
people's verdict one way or the other.
It remains unclear just how quickly Norway's EC application can be
negotiated once submitted. Much will depend on what the priorities are in
Brussels after the muddle over Maastricht. But policy makers in Oslo believe
it could be 1996 or even 1997 before Norway's membership question can be
settled. At least this will provide some time for the Yes to EC campaign to
transform public opinion from its hostility or indifference.
There are certainly powerful voices in favour of EC membership for Norway.
Most mainland industrialists support the cause while widespread backing can
be found among trade union activists. The media is sympathetic across the
spectrum. Among the political parties, the Conservatives and the ultra-right
Progress Party back EC entry. while Labour, after November, will campaign
separately in support of Norwegian EC membership.
The trouble is that this potentially broad and impressive alliance is
similar in composition to the one that narrowly lost this month's referendum
in Denmark. As in 1972, the Norwegian establishment backs EC entry but so
far not enough of the people are prepared to do so.
This makes it easy at the moment for the anti-EC movement to argue that the
issue is really elitist, us against them. If the EC question is polarised in
such a simplistic and emotional way it could be damaging for the pro-EC
coalition.
There is a much more immediate trouble confronting Mrs Brundtland. Unless
the Labour Party starts to restore its lost popularity, the anti-EC parties
 -the Centre and the Socialist Left - look set to increase their
representation in the next parliament. At present they lack the blocking
quarter of seats needed to stop the amendment to the constitution required
to take Norway into the EC after a referendum result.
While the Socialist Left has 17 seats, the Centre holds 11 in a 165-strong
Parliament. On present opinion poll evidence those two parties look set to
win enough seats to thwart any move by whoever is in government after
September 1993 to take Norway into the EC, even if the referendum supports
the EC entry terms.
The main opposition pro-EC Conservatives seem unlikely to win the next
general election.
All of this points to even more confusion after next polling day in
September 1993. Moreover, to add to the difficulties no government can
dissolve a parliament within its full four-year set term.
While Norway embarks on its journey towards the EC it is by no means clear
that it will reach its destination. So much is going to depend on the
ability of Mrs Brundtland to point the way ahead, shift public opinion and
negotiate terms of entry that safeguard Norway"s national interest.

FT  26 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Europe): Milan hits low on public
sector deficit
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By Our Markets Staff
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BOURSES gave a mixed performance yesterday, the mixture partly reflecting a
better start on Wall Street, writes Our Markets Staff.
MILAN fell to a new 1992 low in thin trading on news that the public sector
deficit widened by 28 per cent in the first four months of this year. Delays
in forming a government, and fears of new property and wealth taxes to help
plug the deficit also depressed shares. The Comit index fell 2.78 to 466.21
in turnover estimated at near Wednesday's L84.9bn.
The state telecommunications holding company, Stet, slipped L40 to L1,750
following Wednesday's news of that plans to reorganise the sector had been
postponed until the government was formed. The tax fears took L100 off
Generali to L28,390 while Fondiaria fell L793 to L27,697.
PARIS was lifted by a firm opening on Wall Street but volume was generated
by big block trades in BSN, Lyonnaise des Eaux and Generale des Eaux. The
CAC 40 index rose 20.70 to 1,920.34, in turnover of FFr2.5bn.
Generale des Eaux ended up FFr9 at FFr2,199 after 125,000 shares were traded
at FFr2,205. A block of 140,000 shares in BSN was crossed at FFr1,101, and
the stock closed up FFr6 at FFr1,096. Lyonnaise des Eaux, which saw 150,000
shares traded, rose FFr11 to FFr529. A block of 153,000 shares in Pinault
was also crossed, at FFr373, as the stock closed up FFr1.50 at FFr373.50.
Michelin rose FFr7 or 3.5 per cent to FFr209.7 ahead of its annual meeting
today.
AMSTERDAM was pulled both ways by the higher oil price and weaker dollar.
The CBS Tendency index finally closed up 0.1 at 124.7.
Royal Dutch gained on the oil price, up 50 cents at Fl 152.90 while Ahold,
which has large exposure to the US, was among the losers, down Fl 1.10 at Fl
83.50.
Reports of lower CD sales was to blame for the 20 cents loss in Polygram
which finished at Fl 49.30. Philips was stronger, rising 50 cents to Fl
31.10 while DAF shed 50 cents to Fl 22.50. Some analysts remain positive on
the truckmaker's 1992 prospects, expecting a substantial increase in its UK
sales.
FRANKFURT eased in slightly higher volume as the market extended Wednesday's
after-hours drop in Daimler. The stock dropped a net DM12 to DM770.50
yesterday, but this partly reflected its drop to DM776.70 late on Wednesday,
down from an official close of DM795.50, as it went ex dividend of DM13.
Turnover rose from DM4.6bn to DM5.2bn as the FAZ fell 1.14 to 710.05 at
midsession and the DAX by 3.60 to 1,764.89 at the close.
Porsche lost some of its recent gains with a fall of DM6 to DM587 and
Volkswagen, one of Europe's best performing blue chips this year, closed
DM3.80 lower at DM398.20.
Harpener fell DM23 to DM276 on VEW's purchase of a controlling stake.
Schmalbach-Lubeca, the recently ebullient Viag packaging subsidiary, hit a
sour note after Wednesday's news that 1992 was proving more difficult; the
shares fell DM48 to DM499, although Viag rose DM1.30 to DM404.70.
MADRID staged a late rally having sunk during the session to its lowest
level this year. The general index closed 1.74 stronger at 241.73 in volume
of some Pta18bn.
Telefonica, which has been losing ground all week following fresh problems
in its pension fund talks with unions, closed up Pta15 at Pta1,040. In
banking, Popular climbed Pta70 to Pta11,000 while Santander gained Pta90 to
Pta4,550.
STOCKHOLM fell back again, the Affarsvarlden general index easing 3.3 to
926.9 in low turnover of SKr196m. Astra fell SKr3 to SKr517 and SKF dropped
SKr2 to SKr113.
VIENNA fell to its lowest level for seven weeks on publication of data which
showed a rise in monthly inflation. The ATX index lost 7.50 to 949.50 with
some analysts saying that hopes for an early cut in interest rates had
receded. The textile maker, Lenzing, fell Sch39 or 4.2 per cent to Sch888.
ISTANBUL closed at a four-month high on news that parliament had approved a
tax reform measure. The 75-share index rose to an intraday high of 4,313
before falling back slightly, closing up 309.18 or 7.7 per cent at 4,291.71.
The measure provides a five-year tax exemption to pension funds and life
insurance companies on capital gains from trading in stocks and mutual
funds.
Cukurova Elektrik gained TL500 to TL6,400.

FT  26 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets (Asia Pacific): Nikkei regains 16,000
level on late buying
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   TOKYO
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
LAST-MINUTE buying by a leading Japanese broker helped the Nikkei index
recover to above the 16,000 mark yesterday, after falling to its lowest
level since October 1986 on Wednesday, writes Emiko Terazono in Tokyo.
The 225-issue average finished 290.05 firmer at 16,143.72. It registered a
day's low of 15,733.14 in early trading on encountering selling by
individuals and companies, and rebounded on small-lot buying by foreigners
and institutions to reach a high of 16,217.88 in the afternoon.
Volume picked up to 250m shares from 227m, traders noting US demand.
Advances outnumbered declines by 576 to 366, with 164 issues unchanged. The
Topix index of all first section stocks improved 15.13 to 1,248.50, but in
London the ISE/Nikkei 50 index ended 2.37 easier at 982.14.
Lower interest rates encouraged investors. Bonds rallied, with the yield on
the number 129 10-year issue falling from 5.35 to 5.325 per cent. Money
market participants also anticipated lower short-term rates, as the
three-month certificates of deposit rate eased to 4.5 per cent from 4.52 per
cent.
Traders said an absence of arbitrage selling also supported the Nikkei.
However, some sceptics argued that Japanese brokers were pushing up equity
prices ahead of today's spate of shareholders' meetings. More than 1,800
companies will hold shareholders' meetings today.
High-technology issues were sought by foreign investors. Toshiba surged
ahead Y39 to Y633 and Sony Y220 to Y4,250. Other blue chips were also
sought, with Nippon Steel gaining Y4 to Y265 and Nissan Motor Y23 to Y558.
Bank issues rose on bargain hunting, with Industrial Bank of Japan putting
on Y70 to Y1,550 and Fuji Bank Y20 to Y1,230. Trust banks, on the other
hand, thought to be facing a rise in bad loans due to extensive lending to
real estate companies, were weaker. Mitsui Trust and Banking declined Y15 to
Y630 and Sumitomo Trust and Banking Y5 to Y815.
Misawa Homes plunged by its daily limit of Y210 to Y940. The stock has lost
35 per cent in the past 10 days on rumours of growing debts at the company's
resort and golf course development subsidiaries.
NTT fell Y10,000 to an all-time low of Y581,000. 'With over 1.6m individual
investors, the plunge in NTT will definitely harm sentiment,' said a broker.
In Osaka, the OSE average moved forward 110.26 to 18,937.12 in volume of
22.3m shares.
Roundup
THE strongest feature among Pacific Rim markets yesterday was Hong Kong,
while Seoul continued to decline.
HONG KONG closed sharply higher, with the Hang Seng index ahead 113.48, or
1.9 per cent, at 6,078.69. Turnover came to HKDollars 4.9bn.
Banks led the way, with HSBC Holdings rising HKDollars 1.50 to HKDollars
47.25 ahead of yesterday's close of its bid for Midland Bank, of the UK.
Hang Seng Bank climbed HKDollars 2.25 to HKDollars 49.75, Wing Lung
HKDollars 2.50 to HKDollars 62.00 and Bank of East Asia HKDollars 1.25 to
HKDollars 35.
SEOUL set another 4 1/2 -year low in spite of intervention by the
stabilisation fund. The composite index shed 3.69 to 548.30 in turnover of
Won167bn. Falls outpaced rises by 592 to 132.
TAIWAN closed sharply lower on profit-taking and the weighted index lost
90.07, or 1.9 per cent, to 4,565.01. The financial sector fell 3.3 per cent.
Turnover decreased to TDollars 35.6bn from TDollars 41.3bn.
SINGAPORE had blue chips in demand. The Straits Times Industrial index added
12.64 at 1,501.35.
The shipyard sector was active, with Sembawang Shipyard up 25 cents at
SDollars 7.95 and Jurong Shipyard gaining 15 cents to SDollars 9.30.
KUALA LUMPUR's composite index put on 4.60 to 598.60, but Amalgamated Steel
Mills slipped 8 cents to MDollars 2.76 after announcing a rights issue.
AUSTRALIA closed marginally lower in directionless trade. The All Ordinaries
index dipped 3.0 to 1,644.6. Tobacco issues lost ground on the US Supreme
Court ruling that companies may be liable to personal injury claims arising
from smoking. Rothmans tumbled 55 cents to ADollars 7.20.
NEW ZEALAND saw heavy trade in Brierley and Carter Holt Harvey, while the
NZSE-40 index shed 2.57 to 1,530.33. Carter Holt and Fletcher Challenge each
lost a cent to NZDollars 2.63 and NZDollars 3.54 respectively.
BOMBAY fell in very light volume as trading resumed hesitantly, and some
said nominally, after a 10-day boycott by stockbrokers. The BSE index
dropped 59.48, or 1.90 per cent, to 3,081.32.
KARACHI built on Wednesday's gains, the 100-share index putting on 33.94 to
1,558.07 for a two-day rise of 69.46, or 4.7 per cent, as institutions
bought fuel, energy and pharmaceutical shares.

FT  26 JUN 92 / World Stock Markets: Accra reaches critical time in widening
its equity base - Extensive divestment by the Ghanaian state, and new issues
are in prospect
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIAN OZANNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A historic event occurred earlier this month for the young Ghana Stock
Exchange. Super Paper Products, a Ghanaian manufacturing company, became the
GSE's first new listing since it started operations in November 1990.
With blackboard and chalk, and a public trading floor laid out like a
classroom, Ghana's nascent stock exchange is laying the foundations of what
its officials hope will prove to be one of Africa's most promising emerging
markets.
Given a current equity capitalisation of only C31bn (Dollars 77m) from 15
listed companies, the twice weekly call-over of offers and bids among the
three registered brokers, acting mostly for individuals, appears slightly
incongruous with the GSE's ambitions.
But Mr Yeboa Amoa, managing director of the GSE, says that after years of
macro-economic adjustment and liquidity squeezes the stock exchange has
arrived at a critical time: the government has deepened its commitment to
the divestment of more than 330 state-owned companies; and private
companies, having gained confidence in the economy, are looking at raising
money through new issues.
Meanwhile, low volume and the limited number of shares in the public float
are the market's major problems.
One of the greatest hopes of the GSE this year is that the government will
agree to its proposals to float at least a part of the 55 per cent holding
in Ashanti Goldfields in Accra. The government is preparing to sell up to 20
per cent of the equity in AGC, in which Lonrho, the international
conglomerate, holds 45 per cent.
A possible dual flotation on the London and Accra exchanges has been
suggested as one likely avenue for the divestiture of AGC, which posted a
net profit of C23.5bn last year from production of 589,452 ounces of fine
gold. Sixty per cent of the government's holdings in several state-owned
banks, including the giant Ghana Commercial Bank, are also due to be
divested within 18 months.
Mr Amoa also believes that Ghanaian companies such as Super Paper Products
are now beginning to look seriously at the GSE as a means of raising
capital, to expand their operations or pay off crippling debts. At least
three new listings and three rights issues are expected within the next nine
months.
Institutional investors, who previously put their money into high-interest
treasury instruments, are also looking at the GSE as interest rates come
down with falling inflation. Furthermore, the GSE is hoping to attract, by a
nationwide media campaign, the estimated C80bn to C100bn of money
circulating outside the banking system.
Critical changes in government policy, however, are anxiously awaited to
give the GSE the boost it needs. First, the government has to make either
administrative or legislative changes to allow participation of foreigners
and non-resident Ghanaians in the GSE.
At the moment the Foreign Exchange Control Act would prevent foreigners from
trading in shares on the GSE - a regulation out of step with the
government's stated commitment to foreign investment and the protocols it
has signed with the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) to
allow free movement of capital.
Mr Amoa says: 'We want the big emerging markets funds and foreign pension
funds to come here. Our aim is untrammeled access to this market.'
The second measure which must be taken is to allow government bonds to be
traded in the secondary market, and to abolish the 10 per cent withholding
tax on dividends which makes government paper more attractive than equities.
At the moment government bonds can only be resold to the central bank at a
discount.
Finally, the members of the GSE are waiting for a clear timetable of the
government's extensive divestiture plans, including its plans to sell
significant shareholdings in companies already listed.
On an average trading day in Accra only 17,000 shares change hands. Good
quality shares in sufficient quantity are not available and the market shows
some distorted prices, such as Mobil Ghana's - trading at two times earnings
in spite of having posted a 30 per cent dividend this month.
The GSE, however, believes its inevitable breakthrough is just about to
happen.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Flooded Bolivian farmers on
hunger strike
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By FRANCIS FREISINGER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   SANTA CRUZ
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE BOLIVIAN Eastern Farmers Chamber (CAO) has declared an indefinite hunger
strike in protest at the lack of government aid in the wake of the
agricultural disaster that has struck the Santa Cruz department as a result
of months of flooding. Peasant groups have announced other measures in
support of the CAO - including road blocks - and a regional general strike
may follow.
Santa Cruz in the east of the country, which produces 90 per cent of
Bolivia's agricultural exports, principally soyabeans and sugar, has been
devastated since January by the worst floods in living memory. At least a
third and possibly as much as half the crop has been lost already and the
sowing of the next crop has been seriously disrupted, the losses will
continue for another harvest. At least Dollars l00m has been lost to date, a
vast sum for Bolivia. As a result there will be a marked reduction in GNP
growth this year according to economists.
Nearly a hundred farmers from the CAO have joined the hunger strike,
including some of the wealthiest men in the country, and as many as 500 more
are poised to follow. In a remarkable development, the hardline right-wing
farmers have literally become bedfellows with their traditional enemy, the
Bolivian Workers' Central (COB), the national union confederation which
still adheres, at least in theory, to a revolutionary Marxist ideology. Some
of COB leaders have joined the hunger strike and are now sleeping in the
same room as the farmers.
The farmers are calling for much more direct government and international
assistance as well as rescheduling of loans from both private banks and
multinational institutions, principally the Inter-American Development Bank.
They are demanding special help for the smaller farmers, worst hit
financially because of their lack of access to credit, as a result of which
thousands face bankruptcy. The CAO President, Mr Sergio Justiniano said: 'We
will remain on hunger strike until a global solution is found'.
The flooding is partly the result of exceptionally heavy rains that have
accompanied the El Nino cyclical Pacific weather phenomenon, which has also
brought flooding this year to Peru and Ecuador. However, according to
ecologists, the effect has been exacerbated in Bolivia by the extensive
deforestation that has accompanied the agricultural boom of the past few
years
Despite officially declaring the region a disaster zone, the government
claims that it is unable to help. Mr Hugo Lozino, minister of peasant
development said: 'We have done what we can. Bolivia is a poor country and
can't afford to do more'.
It seems unlikely, however, that the government will be able to resist the
powerful alliance confronting it, especially as it faces unrest in other key
sectors, including mining.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Climbing copper prices boost
trading at LME
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By KENNETH GOODING, Mining Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CLIMBING COPPER prices yesterday sparked one of the busiest trading days on
the London Metal Exchange for several months. Other metal prices -
particularly those of zinc and tin - followed in copper's wake. But some
analysts quickly discounted suggestions that buoyant metals prices were
indicating a rapid world economic recovery.
Copper, used in a wide range of industries such as construction, transport
and communications, historically has been a leading indicator of economic
recovery. However, at present its price was being pushed up not by any
strengthening of demand but by worries about supplies, suggested Mr David
Humphries, an economist at the RTZ Corporation, the world's biggest mining
group.
Metals demand in Japan, which accounted for about 18 per cent of world
usage, would fall this year. Prospects in the European Community, accounting
for 30 per cent, were looking dim because Germany, the driving force, was
'coming off the boil,' he added. Only in the US, accounting for 25 per cent
of world metals usage, was demand showing signs of recovery.
Mr Graham Deller, analyst at the Metals &amp; Minerals Research Services
consultancy group, pointed out that OECD industrial production - an
important indicator of potential metals demand - was lower in the first
quarter this year than in the final quarter of 1991 and was unchanged in the
1992 second quarter. MMRS was looking for industrial production to improve
by only 0.5 per cent this year.
'As industrial production usually leads metals prices by about six months,
even if there is a pick-up in the second half of this year, we would not see
any big pick-up in metals prices until late 1993 or even 1994,' said Mr
Deller.
Copper's price in dollars jumped to the highest level for more than a year
on the LME at one point yesterday. Three-month copper closed last night up
Pounds 13.75 a tonne at Pounds 1,277.
Three-month zinc closed at Dollars 1,277.50 a tonne, up Dollars 32. Traders
suggested this reflected fears that the market's technical tightness would
continue for some time. Mr Humphries said: 'There has been so much technical
activity in the zinc market I'm reluctant to say whether any price movement
is evidence of anything at all.'
However, he said tin continued to reflect substantial production cuts in
recent years. Three-month tin closed last night at Dollars 6,852 a tonne, up
Dollars 115.

London COCOA futures recovered from fresh 16 1/2 -year lows to record slight
gains, but dealers said they were under no illusions that the long-term
downtrend had ended. 'The small rise was down to bargain-hunting. Nothing's
happened to change our bearishness,' said one trader. Talk of selling by
Ghana and Ivory Coast, with the threat of more to come, kept the market
under pressure. New York cocoa futures were firm at midday on the softness
of the dollar. GOLD and PLATINUM added slightly to earlier gains in
afternoon trading on the London bullion market. But trade remained patchy
and neither metal looked like breaking out of current tight ranges, dealers
said. Platinum dealers in particular faced a dilemma; they were reluctant to
go short with the situation in South Africa so uncertain, but downside
pressure has been building recently due to a perceived slowdown in demand as
major economies show signs of weakness. In Chicago WHEAT prices were higher
at midday on forecasts for rain that could delay harvesting, traders said.
Thunder storms in the southern Great Plains continue to hamper wheat cutting
in Texas, Oklahoma and Kansas.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Coffee talks make little
progress
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BLACKWELL
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
TALKS ON a new international coffee agreement did not appear likely
yesterday to come up with any conclusions that could halt the downward
spiral in prices.
London's robusta coffee market was quiet, awaiting developments at the
International Coffee Organisation, where the talks are due to end this
evening.
The momentum towards a new agreement has undoubtedly gathered pace since
March, when the Brazilian exporters decided to end their opposition to
export quotas.
Since ICO talks in April ended inconclusively producers have had meetings to
try to hammer out a policy, but consumers have not met.
Yesterday delegates were wrestling with the problems of so-called
selectivity, which aims to classify coffee in order to give consumers choice
over which type they import. The mood was better than early in the week,
but, in the words of one producer, the talks were 'like jogging on the
spot'.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: British Columbia tries to end
pulp strike

BRITISH COLUMBIA is trying to restart negotiations to end a damaging
two-week-old pulp and paper industry strike.
Mr Moe Sihota, the labour minister asked the government mediator to try to
get the employers and two unions back to the table by the weekend, urging
both sides to display flexibility.
However the initial reaction from the employers was sceptical. 'Our
circumstances have not changed and doling out money is not in the cards,'
said Forest Industrial Relations, their bargaining agent.
The strike began June 15 after the Canadian Paperworkers' Union and the
Pulp, Paper &amp; Woodworkers overwhelmingly refused an industry offer of
CDollars 1 (45p) an hour over two years and modest gains in fringe benefits.
The unions last year accepted a 10-month extension of the old contract
because of the industry's heavy losses - well over CDollars 500m in British
Columbia in 1991.
The strike by 13,000 workers has halted 19 pulp and paper mills throughout
British Columbia. Timber prices have moved up and softwood pulp producers
east of the Rockies are seeking a price rise of USDollars 40 a tonne to
USDollars 600 to take effect from July 1.
North American softwood pulp stocks are relatively tight, but newsprint
stocks are sufficient for more than 40 days and there is spare capacity
especially in eastern Canada.
British Columbia accounts for 12 per cent of North American capacity and 18
per cent of combined North American and Scandinavian northern softwood pulp
capacity.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Commodities and Agriculture: Danes face ruin as drought
continues

<TEXT>
SEVERAL THOUSAND Danish farmers appear to be facing ruin as a result of the
worst early-summer drought in living memory, writes Hilary Barnes in
Copenhagen.
Farmers in some areas began harvesting this week, a month earlier than
normal. In other areas they were ploughing back spring-sown crops, which
have been destroyed by the drought.
The national average grain yield 'as of today' is expected to decline by 20
per cent for winter grain and 25 per cent for spring grain, according to the
State Agricultural Advisory Centre. The spring rape and pea harvest will be
down by at least 35 per cent, while the yield from winter rape will be down
by 15-20 per cent.
Mr HAO Kjeldsen, president of the Agricultural Council (umbrella
organisation for all the main farmer's organisations) as appealed to the
industry's creditors not to panic and urged the government to work out a
form of drought aid which will not further increase farm debt.
The Minister for Agriculture, Mr Laurids Tornaes, said on Tuesday that he
was considering how to help the worst-hit groups of farmers.
The Advisory Centre's figures are averages, and yields in areas where there
are light, sandy soils, such as north and west Jutland, may fall by between
50 and 75 per cent generally, with some fields yielding nothing at all.
The 'as of today' outlook could worsen rapidly if there is no rain soon  -
and the forecast is for fine, sunny weather for the next week. The Danish
grain harvest totalled 9.6m tonnes in 1990 and 8.8m tonnes in 1991, while
the rape harvest is about 800,000 tonnes annually.

FT  26 JUN 92 / The Property Market: Common pursuits - UK surveyors'
overseas expansion
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By VANESSA HOULDER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Whenever the British property industry has ventured overseas, it has been
enthusiastically cheered on from the sidelines.
In 1961, for instance, the Investors Chronicle magazine declared: 'Clearly
our property groups will colonise on a tremendous international scale . . .
the British property man has no peer.'
Three decades on and a similar view still prevails. 'There are only a few
sectors of UK business left that can claim to be world leaders. British
surveyors . . . should be added to this select group,' according to the the
Chartered Surveyors Survey, published by the Economic Development Briefing
last year.
Unsurprisingly, these sentiments are echoed throughout the industry. Mr
Michael Aukett, chief executive of Aukett, a firm of architects which opened
a Geneva office in 1989, says: 'We are five years ahead of Europe in terms
of business parks and office parks.'
Mr John Pelling, president of a pan-European association of building
surveyors states: 'In the UK, building surveyors are recognised as having
expertise on problems of existing buildings and refurbishment. Continental
Europe lacks that body of expertise.'
Spurred on by their growing self-confidence and the approach of the single
European market next year, the number of UK professionals working in
continental Europe has risen sharply in the past few years. A plethora of
alliances and mergers has emerged in recent years, adding to the handful of
British property-related companies that are already long-established on the
continent.
But, like the Investors Chronicle's comments of 30 years ago, the
expectations of some of the British firms moving into continental Europe are
over-optimistic. For sure, some companies would probably benefit from a more
cautious approach. In most property markets, local operators rarely give
ground to interlopers. The UK property industry, is no exception. For all
its sophistication, the UK sector has more than its share of parochial and
idiosyncratic elements, which often make the skills of British property
professionals difficult to transfer to the continental market.
This problem of incompatibility is being compounded by the impact of
recession, which has checked the momentum built up in recent years for
European expansion.
Demand for UK surveyors' services in Europe has fallen by 14 per cent in the
past two years, though it still outstrips 1990 levels, according to the
Chartered Surveyors Survey.
This downturn may ultimately unravel the weaker alliances that emerged
during the buoyant late-1980s.
However severe its impact, the recession is unlikely to force a rout on the
scale of the cuts experienced in the early 1970s following the oil price
increases. On that occasion most advisers and developers who had gained a
foothold in continental Europe beat a retreat back to the UK.
In spite of these setbacks, property-related professions will continue to
train their sights on Europe, convinced that this is where their future
lies. A report on the future of the surveying profession commissioned by the
Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors last year, said: 'The UK market
must be seen in the context of that for Europe as a whole. . . With the
increasing breakdown of barriers it will be necessary to look upon Europe,
as a whole, as part of our domestic market,' it said.
Against this backdrop, the inroads made by UK surveyors in continental
Europe have still been modest. Just 0.6 per cent of UK surveyors' Pounds
900m annual fees in 1991 were earned in continental Europe, according to the
Chartered Surveyors Survey, while only one per cent of the members of the
Royal Institute of British Architects (Riba) have branches in continental
Europe. And out of Riba-affiliated architects' total fee income of Pounds
1.25bn in 1991, just over half the Pounds 50m earned overseas was from
Europe.
Hit by recession, property-related professionals will find it tough to
regain the momentum for expansion ahead of the barrier-free single European
market. At least architects' skills are mobile; some of Britain's best-known
architects have enviable international reputations, such as the Richard
Rogers Partnership, which designed the Pompidou centre in Paris.
The surveying profession for its part must overcome some daunting obstacles.
First, there is the problem of nomenclature: the term 'surveyor' is barely
recognised outside the UK. Moreover, UK surveyors often do not have a
professional counterpart in continental Europe where the role of a quantity
surveyor, for example, is often undertaken by an architect.
Quantity surveyors have little currency in Germany, for instance, where they
are only employed on 5 per cent of projects, says Mr Alan Baker of Gleeds',
a firm of quantity surveyors with an office in Germany. 'Some (architects),
perhaps understandably, initially see us as undermining their role . . .
others have always seen the cost control function as a necessary
inconvenience and are happy to hand over responsibility to us.'
The lack of uniformity in surveying qualifications throughout Europe is
another problem for UK firms setting up overseas. The Paris office of Gleeds
is run by Mr Jean-Pierre Pajon, who is bilingual and has worked as a
quantity surveyor in both France and the UK. This combination of language
and technical skills is rare. 'Our main difficulty is that we can't transfer
London staff and French people don't have the quantity surveying training,'
he says.
For UK firms, entering a new market also means getting to grips with
different planning, legal and architectural conventions. 'Shoe horning our
system onto their system doesn't work,' says Mr John Gregory, a partner of
Gleeds.
'The lesson is that every country is different. One must not go into a
country and upset the status quo and disrupt what they have done for
generations,' says Mr John Bryden of Gardiner &amp; Theobald, a firm of quantity
surveyors.
In time, the differing practices in Europe may converge, possibly under a
common EC-inspired code.
An increasing flow of planning initiatives in coming out of Brussels, rather
than Westminster, says Mr Tony Baldry, UK environment minister. This should
aid harmonisation of skills and qualifications. 'EC involvement in planning
and development has been likened to an incoming tide. That tide shows no
sign of ebbing,' says Mr Baldry.
In a move designed to influence the debate on harmonising practices, the
Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS) is opening an office in
Brussels in the autumn. RICS is concerned that well-organised and large
pan-European groupings of, for instance, lawyers and management consultants
will - through lobbying - exert a disproportionate influence on setting new
standards and codes of practice. Surveyors, because of their traditional
lack of natural alliances in continental Europe, could be left out in the
cold, RICS fears.
The institution's goal is to ensure that surveyors play a leading part in
harmonising practices within Europe's property industry. 'We are trying to
position UK chartered surveyors as leaders,' says Ms Marianne Tisser, head
of the European section of RICS.

FT  26 JUN 92 / The Property Market: A positive turn
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
In spite of a slight lengthening of yields and continued downward pressure
on rental values, the Investment Property Databank, an independent research
group, recorded a positive total return of 0.3 per cent for May.
The aggregate equivalent yield rose to 9.8 per cent, largely the result of
office yields moving to an all-time high of 10.1 per cent.
'It is clear that total returns are becoming more and more dependent upon
the buoyancy of income streams, as both rental and capital values continue
to decline,' IPD says. It added that in the central London office sector,
which is the worst hit in the market, more than 70 per cent of premises are
currently over-rented and by an average of more than 35 per cent.
However, the longer term picture is improving, IPD says. For the year ending
May, total returns improved to 2 per cent, while the fall in capital values
was cut, from -5.9 per cent for the year to April to -5.7 per cent for the
year to May. Rental values for the year ending May showed a slight
improvement, to -6.1 per cent.
The retail sector outperformed the industrial sector for the fourth
consecutive month, with retail warehouses proving the most notable target of
investment.
Industrial year-on-year returns have fallen back to their January level,
while retail results continue to improve. Office returns remain the lowest
of the three sectors.

FT  26 JUN 92 / International Bonds: EIB deal has parity with French state
issues
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TRACY CORRIGAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE European Investment Bank yesterday became the first borrower to raise
funds in the Euro-French franc bond market at the same level as the French
government. The bank's FFr2bn five-year deal was priced to offer the same
yield as the 8 1/2 per cent French government OAT due 1997.
Dealers said the bank could have sold bonds at a yield below French
government bonds. The FFr2bn issue launched by Credit Commercial de France
sold out rapidly, helped by strong demand in both France and Italy. By the
end of the day, the spread had tightened to 8 basis points below the OAT
issue.
Demand for EIB paper is typically stronger than for other names because the
agency's bonds are tax-exempt in both Italy and Austria. Italian investors
in particular are enthusiastic buyers of the name and took about a quarter
of this deal.
But the pricing of the deal reflects extremely tight spreads of French Franc
Eurobonds generally. For an issue of 9 1/2 per cent bonds due 1997 by
Societe Nationale des Chemins de Fer Francais, the French railway, is
currently trading at a yield of 10 basis points below the comparable OAT.
Dealers said buying of the new EIB deal was fuelled by expectations of
further tightening. A FFr3bn issue of 8 1/2 per cent bonds due 2002, launced
by the EIB in January at 22 basis points above the 10-year OAT, has
tightened to 22 basis points below the OAT.
At first sight, it appears illogical that investors are prepared to pay more
for EIB or French agency paper than for bonds issued by the French
government, the best credit in the French market.
Dealers say the anomaly is due in part to expectations of heavy supply in
the French Treasury market, fuelled by last week's announcement of an
exchange programme of old bonds for new OATs.
In addition, some investors prefer to hold Eurobonds, which are in bearer
form, rather than book-entry government bonds.
In the dollar market, the Halifax Building Society launched the largest deal
by a UK building society outside the sterling sector. The Dollars 300m
three-year deal via UBS Phillips &amp; Drew was considered rather aggressively
priced, but met buying interest from both retail and institutional
investors.
The deal benefited from renewed interest in the dollar sector among European
investors, based partly on growing expectations that the dollar is set to
firm.
In the Canadian dollar market, a CDollars 200m deal for an arm of Deutsche
Bank also met firm demand. The deal closed at 99.45, slightly above its
reoffer price of 99.40.

OTC listing in US

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Brazilian government said yesterday it would allow the trading of
American depositary receipts in Telebras, the state-owned telecommunications
holding company, on the US over-the-counter market.
The move allows the company to take advantage of exemptions under US
Securities and Exchange Commission rules and therefore avoid full US-style
corporate disclosure. But it would not permit the company to launch an
offering of shares on the US market.
The announcement reduced uncertainty caused by the cancellation this month
of a planned Dollars 1.3bn ADR placement by Telebras. The official
explanation was that a large issue might erode the share price, with a
negative affect on privatisation plans.
However, the cancellation led to speculation about the privatisation of
Telebras, and some expectation that the government might decide to sell its
subsidiaries separately instead of disposing of the holding company in one
move. Telebras shares have fallen 45 per cent this month, although they
rebounded modestly in morning trading yesterday.
Telebras weighs heavily on the Sao Paulo Stock Exchange (Bovespa),
representing about a third of the Bovespa index and generally accounting for
half of daily trading.
The privatisation method was not discussed at the Wednesday meeting between
government and Telebras officials that reached the decision on the ADRs,
said Mr Roberto Wright, head of Telebras's division of capital market
control.
Mr Wright said that the step into the secondary market 'opens a precedent'
and would make it easier to secure an exchange listing and an offering of
shares in the future.

cancelled bonds appear
</HEADLINE>

   NEW YORK
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US REGULATORS yesterday censured Citibank and ordered it to improve controls
on the handling and destruction of cancelled bond certificates after some
certificates the US banking group thought it had destroyed six years ago
turned up recently.
Although most of the cancelled bonds were never exchanged for money, Wall
Street broking house Smith Barney was deceived last November into paying out
Dollars 6.2m on a transaction involving the certificates and a Liechtenstein
bank.
Smith Barney has since filed a lawsuit against Citibank, and against the
Liechtenstein bank, a financial clearing house and Dow Chemical, whose
cancelled bonds it said it unknowingly bought.
Citibank says the suit is without merit. It claims that the certificates
presented to Smith Barney had been perforated to declare them invalid, and
were therefore clearly cancelled.
The controversy over the certificates dates back to 1986, when Citibank used
an outside company to dispose of an unusually large volume of cancelled
certificates that had been in storage.
Although Citibank was assured at the time that all of the certificates had
been destroyed, some found their way to Europe, where last year they were
fraudulently presented for transfer or offered as possible collateral for
loans.
Citibank said that since 1987 its own personnel had destroyed cancelled
certificates on bank premises. Citibank also said yesterday that it believed
it had no 'material financial exposure' to any of the certificates.

MALAYSIA Airlines System (MAS) has agreed a three-year Dollars 170m
syndicated loan facility with 27 international banks to help finance its
expansion programme.
The loan, arranged by the Overseas-Chinese Banking Corp (OCBC), Wardleys and
Indosuez Asia, will be used to part finance the acquisition of more than 70
new air-craft.
This month MAS announced it would be making a one-for-one rights issue at
the end of the year, designed to raise more than Dollars 700m.
MAS has rapidly expanded its fleet and route network in recent years, but
has seen profits slide. In the year to March 31 1992, pre-tax profits fell
to MDollars 119.5m (USDollars 47.6m) from MDollars 205.5m the previous year.
This week the Malaysian government approved an MAS request for air fare
rises of between 15 and 20 per cent on domestic routes. They have been
frozen for the past 10 years.

THE Chicago Board of Trade moved a step closer to recognition as an overseas
investment exchange in the UK yesterday, when the Office of Fair Trading
published its report on the CBOT's application.
The CBOT, one of the three partners behind Globex, the screen-based futures
trading system launched yesterday, needs to be recognised before its
products can be traded on the Globex system in the UK. Its futures and
options on 10-year US Treasury notes can be traded on terminals in New York,
Chicago and Paris, but not London.
The report by the OFT concludes that none of the rules of the CBOT poses
significant competition issues in the futures and options market.
Under the Financial Services Act, the Treasury - which took over the role
from the Department of Trade and Industry on June 7 - has to seek the advice
from the OFT, prior to authorisation. The FSA also requires the Treasury to
take account of investor protection issues.

FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Midland makes its mark on Milan
 -Euromobiliare's planned management changes
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By HAIG SIMONIAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THE departure of Mr Guido Roberto Vitale as managing director of
Euromobiliare, the Milan merchant bank he founded in 1973, points to a
watershed in Italian finance.
Mr Vitale is not stepping down until October, and thereafter will remain on
the board. But, combined with Monday's resignation by Mr Renato Preti as
managing director of Sviluppo, another entrepreneurial merchant bank which
thrived in the strong corporate finance markets of the late 1980s, it
suggests the end of an era.
Mr Vitale's decision probably rests on a mixture of personal and
institutional factors, heightened after the UK's Midland Bank, which already
owned 49 per cent of Euromobiliare, assumed control of a further 5 per cent
last year, giving it a decisive majority.
Closer integration into the Midland network may have been inevitable, even
without the recent raft of problems which have confronted Euromobiliare.
Mergers and acquisitions operations have been increasingly dovetailed with
Midland Montagu, the investment banking arm of the UK institution.
Euromobiliare managers now commute regularly between the City of London and
Milan.
But Midland's concern with Euromobiliare has undoubtedly grown following its
collapse in profitability. The bank reported a group loss of L976m for 1991
and passed its dividend, compared with net earnings of L9.5bn (Dollars
8.09m) in 1990.
The causes were diverse. Income from equity trading slumped, owing to
plunging volumes on the stock market, while Euromobiliare also made heavy
write-downs on its own portfolios as a result of falling share prices.
Meanwhile, staff costs had accelerated following steady expansion.
But among other factors was a L5.5bn write-down of the bank's position on
its holding in VM Motori, the motors group for which it arranged a
management buy-out in 1989. To cap it all, Euromobiliare suffered L3.5bn net
foreign exchange losses.
Cutting costs through job losses and avoiding the same mistakes again are
part of Midland's new recipe. Mr Sencar Toker, Midland Montagu's director
for Europe who will now chair Euromobiliare's executive committee, points to
retrenchment.
The bank will concentrate on the three core businesses of fund management,
corporate finance and securities trading. Illustrating its priorities,
Euromobiliare is paying L30bn to buy a Florence-based fund manager with
around L1,000bn under management.
But Mr Vitale's decision and the changes at Euromobiliare also reflect wider
factors. Bankers say Mr Vitale may have been losing steam after almost 20
years at the company. And Euromobiliare's image has suffered recently from
staff defections and its association with L'Indipendente, the newspaper it
helped to launch last year.
The management changes come as Italian merchant banking undergoes a wider
transformation. Economic recession has caused a drop in corporate finance
and M&amp;A business. The market has become more competitive as some of the
world's top investment banks have moved into Milan in the 1990s.
Some bankers think houses like Euromobiliare, which made their name with
audacious corporate finance deals on the back of Italy's economic boom in
the 1980s, will have to respond.
With fewer mandates and more competition, the presence of Midland - plus the
Hongkong and Shanghai Bank - with its wider international links, may have
become more important.
That has been true at Sviluppo, whose founder, Mr Francesco Micheli, sold
control to the Dutch ING banking and insurance group last December.
With the Mr Vitale's gradual retreat, it appears to be the case at
Euromobiliare, too.

LOTUS Development, the US personal computers software publisher best known
for its spreadsheet programs, yesterday warned that its second-quarter
results would disappoint Wall Street.
Although the company expects earnings per share to rise by at least 40 per
cent to between 30 and 40 cents for the quarter to June 30, the results are
significantly lower than the 45 cents analysts had expected.
The stock market reacted to the news by marking Lotus's shares Dollars 4 3/4
lower to Dollars 19 1/4 in active morning trading.
In 1991, second-quarter net income was Dollars 9.1m or 21 cents a share on
revenues of Dollars 186.4m.

DESPITE lower tobacco profits from Australia and a difficult year for luxury
goods, the Swiss-based Richemont group, controlled by the Rupert family in
South Africa, recorded an 11 per cent rise in earnings in the year to March.
Sales rose by 4 per cent to Pounds 3.1bn while pre-tax profits advanced by a
similar margin to Pounds 620m (Dollars 1.15bn). Attributable profits, before
extraordinary items, were 11.3 per cent higher at Pounds 197.3m. Earnings
per depositary unit rose 11.3 per cent to Pounds 343.60, while dividends per
unit are being increased by 11.1 per cent to Pounds 56.25.
The company also plans to subdivide the Richemont units in the ratio of 10
to 1 to bring them to a level more comparable with the shares of other
leading companies on the Swiss stock exchanges.
Richemont has large interests in tobacco and luxury goods. Companies and
brand names which form part of the group include Rothmans, Dunhill, Cartier
Monde, Mont Blanc pens and Piaget watches.
Richemont is a highly sought after share in Johannesburg, because of its
hard currency earnings. Its market capitalisation of about R19.2bn (Dollars
6.86bn) is the highest of any industrial company on the Johannesburg Stock
Exchange. It is trading on a price/earnings multiple of 23.2 and a dividend
yield of 0.7.
Tobacco operating profits from subsidiaries rose by 15.4m to Pounds 367m,
due largely to improved profitability in Canada, Germany and Poland.
Meanwhile, operating profits on the luxury goods side rose to Pounds 214.6m
from Pounds 206.1m. Costs savings helped boost Cartier's profits by 7.6 per
cent to 163.6m. Sales at Dunhill were 10.6 per cent higher at Pounds 230.4m
due to the purchase of a substantial interest in Alfred Dunhill's Japanese
distributor. Dunhill operating profits were marginally higher at Pounds
55.7m.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BERNARD SIMON

<TEXT>
OLYMPIA &amp; York has lost a significant source of income with a decision by
its 75 per cent owned subsidiary, Gulf Canada Resources, to suspend common
share dividends.
Gulf paid a dividend of 40 cents a share last year, which translated into
payments of CDollars 46m (USDollars 38.3m) to O&amp;Y.
Gulf continues to pay dividends, however, on its preferred shares. O&amp;Y owns
62 per cent of the preferreds, and its income from this source was CDollars
34m in 1991.
The halt in common dividends is designed to help Gulf pay down debt and to
maintain investments in Russia, Indonesia and western Canada. The company
said yesterday that it was one of two western oil companies which Russia has
exempted from its oil export tax.
Gulf said removal of the tax allows it to step up production of the
KomiArcticOil joint venture in Siberia, in which it has a 25 per cent
interest.
In another move to generate cash, Gulf is buying the 55 per cent it does not
already own of Beaufinco Equipment, which operates an Arctic oil drilling
venture.

interim profits

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
TRIZEC, North America's biggest publicly-traded property developer, has cut
its dividend as part of efforts to shore up the real estate arm of the vast
business empire controlled by Toronto's Bronfman family.
Trizec's decision to cut its semi-annual dividend, from 18 Canadian cents to
12 cents a share, comes on the heels of a CDollars 275m (USDollars 229m)
privately-placed equity issue earlier this month. In addition, its 67 per
cent-owned subsidiary, Bramalea, last week announced that it was suspending
dividends and seeking to restructure its debt.
Trizec and Bramalea have combined long-term borrowings of CDollars 14.6bn,
which is about CDollars 1bn more than the debt of ailing developer Olympia &amp;
York. O&amp;Y has a minority stake in Trizec.
Calgary-based Trizec reported earnings of CDollars 12m, equal to a loss of
1.4 cents a share, for the six months to April 30, down from CDollars 31.8m,
or 7.9 cents a share, a year earlier. Rental revenues rose slightly to
CDollars 694m from CDollars 685m. The figures include consolidation of
loss-making Bramalea.
Cash-flow from operations tumbled to CDollars 72.8m from CDollars 114.5m,
due to interest payments on recently-completed developments. The interest
bill for the six months rose to CDollars 233m from CDollars 220m.
Trizec controls over 300 income-producing properties, with space roughly 25
times that of London's Canary Wharf. The company said that occupancy in its
office buildings had risen slightly in the past six months to 90 per cent.
Occupancies in US shopping centres had also improved to 92.5 per cent.
But Mr Kevin Benson, president, said no significant recovery was likely
until 1993.
Trizec's recent share issue, which diluted its equity by almost 40 per cent,
underlines the difficulty which North American property developers are
experiencing in raising debt.
The shares were issued at CDollars 4.50 each, which marked a 20-year low in
Trizec's share price.
Trizec's controlling shareholder, Carena, contributed CDollars 50m towards
the issue. Nonetheless, outsiders are interpeting the issue as a sign that
the Bronfmans' top managers would prefer Trizec and Bramalea to sort out
their problems by themselves.

FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: BP America to axe 600 jobs in
cost-cutting move
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALAN FRIEDMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BP of America, citing the impact of recession, said it plans to cut its US
operating costs by Dollars 125m by eliminating 600 to 700 jobs in its
corporate headquarters staff and refining and marketing divisions.
The job cuts, to be felt largely in the Cleveland, Ohio, region, where BP of
America is based, were presented as part of the British energy group's
programme of seeking Dollars 750m of cost reductions.
The new US cuts, which include the near halving of BP of America's
Cleveland-based corporate headquarters staff of 610 people, mirror the UK
head office job reductions announced in April. At that time, BP said it was
eliminating 700 of the 1,450 jobs from its head office at Britannic House in
London.
Beyond the 250 to 300 job cuts at it Cleveland headquarters, BP of America
also plans to eliminate between 375 and 500 refining and marketing jobs from
its BP Oil and BP Chemicals divisions in the US.
The US job cuts come less than three weeks after BP of America said it was
planning to dispose of assets in Florida and California, including more than
300 petrol stations and two distribution terminals. That decision marked a
turnround in BP's US strategy of building up its west coast network of
filling stations.
Last month, BP raised Dollars 314m by selling off its 56.94 per cent
shareholding in BP Canada.
After the new job cuts, BP of America will still have nearly 35,000
employees. Its 1991 turnover was Pounds 9.3bn (Dollars 17.2bn).

DICKSON Concepts, the up-market Hong Kong retailer, will pursue its strategy
of buying high-quality international brands despite its withdrawal yesterday
from a HKDollars 235m (USDollars 30.39m) rescue bid for Charles Jourdan, one
of France's leading shoemakers.
Dickson agreed terms in April to acquire Jourdan, which has for several
years been in financial difficulty, from Birsina Holding, a private Swiss
company. Announcing the move, Mr Dickson Poon, the chairman, said the
decision had been taken after completing a close examination of Charles
Jourdan's financial position.
Mr Dickson Poon, chairman, said his company had come to the decision that
proceeding with the bid was not in the best interests of his shareholders.
He said confidentiality agreements precluded him from giving detailed
reasons for his withdrawal.
'Our objectives are clearly stated and we have no plans to alter them,' said
Mr Poon. 'We will not buy for the sake of buying, but if and when the right
opportunity arises we will pursue it.'
Hong Kong analysts estimate that Dickson has net cash reserves of around
Dollars HK400m. On Monday, the company will report its results for the year
to March 31. Analysts are expecting net profits of between HKDollars 265m
and HKDollars 290m. This compares with earnings of HKDollars 243m in the
previous year.
Dickson Concepts is a niche retailer of luxury products. It has an exclusive
licence to retail the products of ST Dupont in Hong Kong and Japan. Last
October, the group acquired Harvey Nichols, the luxury London department
store from the embattled Burton Group, for Pounds 53.7m (USDollars 99.34m)
Jourdan, known worldwide for its classic women's shoes, said yesterday it
had 'no immediate plans' to look for another financial partner.

<TEXT>
A FURTHER weakening of the South African economy, already in recession for
three years, has caused Malbak, the industrial holding company in the Gencor
group, to lower its earnings forecast for the year to August.
When its interim figures were published in April, Malbak said it was on
track to achieve its target earnings of 117 cents per share. Now, however,
the company says it expects earnings to be about 10 per cent lower, at 105
cents a share.
The announcement confirms the view of analysts that companies with year-ends
this summer are likely to produce worse results than the market has been
anticipating.
Mr Grant Thomas, executive chairman, said the earnings forecast was the
result of a marked deterioration in business conditions with no likelihood
of improvement before the financial year-end.
Malbak has a strong consumer orientation with large interests in packaging
and paper, food and pharmaceuticals. In the six months to the end of
February, the group lifted attributable earnings by 29 per cent to R152m
(Dollars 54.20m) on a turnover of R5.3bn.

FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Toyota keeps to its tried and
tested formula - But there are signs of dissension over its high-volume
strategy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By STEVEN BUTLER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISSENSION in the boardroom is not standard Japanese management practice.
Yet subtle signs are emerging that Toyota Motor, Japan's most profitable
company as well as its biggest carmaker, is locked in debate over which
direction to turn the steering wheel.
Toyota is trying to decide what implications to draw from the current steep
downturn in the vehicle market. Is it simply a cyclical decline from which
Toyota and rest of the industry will recover in due course? Or rather, is it
the sign of changing times, which will require Toyota to lower its long-term
growth expectations, lengthen product cycles, reduce the number of models on
sale, raise prices and profits, and stop expanding so aggressively overseas?
Depending on who you talk to at Toyota these days, you could get a very
different answer.
The road that Toyota eventually chooses matters a lot to the rest of the
vehicle industry. With 41 per cent of the domestic Japanese market, and
Dollars 13bn in the bank, it is the world's richest vehicle company. This
year's expected 30 per cent decline in pre-tax profits is, by itself,
unimportant in the longer term because Toyota has the resources to carry on
with a low-margin, high-volume strategy for a very long time.
Competitors like Nissan Motor, number two in Japan, which are openly saying
they want higher profits rather than growth in sales, may have a tough time
realising this goal unless Toyota gives them some breathing space.
The prospect of a turn away from growth strategies has been discussed widely
in the Japanese media.
'Yes, there have been a lot of articles about this recently,' concedes Mr
Soichiro Toyoda, president of Toyota, with a slightly dismissive air, as
though Toyota need not overly concern itself with the latest fad
preoccupying the press.
'By now, I have more than 30 years experience in vehicles, and it is not the
case that the industry only goes up,' he says. 'It is normal for business to
be good and then to be bad. Even though it is bad now, it will improve.
Therefore, there is room for hope for the world's automobile industry.'
Translated, this sphinx-like pronouncement means that Mr Toyoda does not
believe the recession marks the end of an era of rapid growth for the
Japanese companies. It is simply one more economic cycle to be ridden out.
A more junior director at Toyota, however, sees the situation somewhat
differently, and says Toyota must adapt to longer-term expectations of lower
growth and improve the quality of its profits.
'The strategy must be to shift toward quality, to emphasise quality,' he
says. This does not mean, however, just selling more luxury cars. 'I don't
think we will be one-sidedly focusing on the upper end of the market.'
Rather, according to this director, Toyota will have to do what many critics
of the company are demanding: raise margins by cutting down on the variety
of optional equipment it offers to its customers and pulling out of
low-volume niche markets by reducing the number of models available.
'The product cycle will be getting longer,' he says. 'All the manufacturers
will be moving in this direction.'
Mr Toyoda, however, sees things somewhat differently. Because Toyota's
customers are demanding new models and because Toyota must introduce new
technology to meet safety and environmental standards, he says lengthening
the model cycle beyond the current four-year standard will be difficult.
He says: 'Because of the two factors - the wishes of customers and the hopes
of society - our technicians are unable to relax. There is a feeling that we
are too exhausted and wouldn't it be nice to lengthen the model cycle, but
it is difficult because not all of us agree on this.'
It is, of course, natural in a company the size of Toyota that its leaders
would not all see the future the same way, and there is no suggestion that
Toyota is in disarray. Mr Stephen Usher, analyst at Kleinwort Benson,
nonetheless sees evidence of indecision, and of a split in the company's
directors between an old guard that does not wish to change its ways, and
younger executives who believe that Toyota has reached a turning point.
He says: 'They are like the bully on the block who won't back down, but
doesn't want to fight any more.'
As Mr Usher sees it, the Japanese carmakers will have to spend enormous
amounts of capital in the years ahead to develop a new generation of more
efficient, environmentally-friendly cars.
The question is where that money will come from. In years past, when the
stock market was booming, Japanese companies could raise capital for next to
nothing, 1 per cent or less. Now they are having to pay 7 per cent to borrow
money (and Toyota just raised Dollars 1bn at these rates).
'Developing the next generation of vehicles will require much higher
internal cash-flow,' he says. This will have to come from higher prices and
profit margins, longer model cycles, and fewer, better-targeted product
offerings.
The logic of this argument is obvious to all of Toyota's Japanese
competitors, who are to one degree or another heavily in debt.
Only Toyota has the luxury of being able to postpone decision day by running
down the enormous pile of cash it has accumulated. For a company as
successful as Toyota, whose engineering and management practices are
imitated all over the world, it is difficult to imagine that it would
fritter away all that it has worked so hard to accumulate.
On the other hand, perhaps Mr Toyoda is right after all, for Toyota if not
for the whole industry. Baring Securities has calculated Toyota's return on
assets as averaging 10.16 per cent from 1988 to 1991, compared to 3.3 per
cent for Nissan and 7.02 per cent for Honda.
While the ratios are lower today, perhaps Toyota's higher profitability will
in the end enable it to generate the cash it needs without a change in
strategy. And if the competition has to sweat in the meantime, well, that's
capitalism.

FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: BHP results expected to reflect
Australia's depressed economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By BRUCE JACQUES

   SYDNEY
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Australian financial markets are likely to be presented with a microcosm
of their depressed economy later today when the country's biggest company,
BHP, reports its results for the year to May.
Analysts expect the company, with interests extending through the
fundamental economic sectors of steel, minerals and petroleum, will report
its lowest earnings since 1987.
Earnings estimates range widely, but are generally between ADollars 800m
(USDollars 600m) and ADollars 900m, a big fall on the previous year's record
ADollars 1.4bn net profits.
BZW Australia analysts are at the lower end of the scale, forecasting a
bottom line of ADollars 812m, while SBC Dominguez Barry is forecasting
ADollars 882m. Any result in this range would bring to an end a run which
has seen BHP's earnings almost double since 1987.
Many believe that growth was hit by the shock to management of an attempt by
the late Australian entrepreneur, Mr Robert Holmes a Court, to wrest control
of the company.
The attempt was only beaten off by a marriage of convenience between BHP and
the Foster's Brewing group, then Elders IXL, and headed by another
Australian in the entrepreneur class, Mr John Elliott.
Ironically, as it announces its results, BHP is negotiating to take virtual
control over Foster's, having placed the brewing group's leading
shareholder, Mr Elliott's International Brewing Investments (IBI), in
receivership.
BHP is still negotiating to buy out a syndicate of banks which has
prior-ranking security over ADollars 1.2bn owed by IBI, and there were
suggestions last night of a significant development today.
BHP's minerals division is expected to be its 1991-92 earnings mainstay,
having contributed ADollars 505.6m of the ADollars 686m profit the company
reported for the nine months to February.
The overall nine-month result reflected a dip of nearly 40 per cent, with
the steel division reporting a 43 per cent earnings fall to ADollars 134m
and petroleum off 41 per cent at ADollars 305m. The minerals division
restricted its earnings fall to 23 per cent.
The depressed Australian economy has forced BHP to sell its growing steel
output into lower yield export markets. Steel exports rose almost 23 per
cent to 2.42m tonnes in the latest year, with domestic despatches falling 8
per cent to 3.17m tonnes.
But BHP's coal and iron ore output ran at near record levels, although
prices for these commodities have fallen. Petroleum products production was
mixed and affected by lower prices.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
MISAWA Homes, the Japanese house builder, yesterday announced its
consolidated results a day early following a plunge in its stock price after
rumours of financial problems.
Jitters over Japan's property-related companies have been souring investor
sentiment. Last week, rumours of problems at Daikyo, the leading condominium
builder, sent the stock plunging, and the Tokyo market with it.
Misawa, following Daikyo's example last Thursday, yesterday denied rumours
that it faced financial difficulties stemming from deteriorating business at
its resort and golf development subsidiaries.
However, the announcements were far from reassuring. Mr Bernard Siman,
property analyst at Jardine Fleming in Tokyo, said: 'Assurances are not
enough to calm worries; the only way to convince investors is real
disclosure.'
Misawa's stock price fell by its daily limit of Y210 to Y940. The share
price of Daikyo, although recovering from its all-time low, remains 27 per
cent lower than 10 days ago. The prices reflect worries over problems at
Japanese property-related companies, notorious for shuffling their books.
Many investors are still shocked by last year's failure of Maruko, a company
specialising in one-room apartments and listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange.
Following market rumours of bankruptcy last summer, Maruko announced a
restructuring plan. However, it went under a few days later.
Misawa's consolidated pre-tax profits for the year to March plunged 38.6 per
cent to Y12.7bn (Dollars 1bn) on a 0.7 per cent rise in sales to Y473.2bn.
On a consolidated basis, the company's short-term borrowings rose 34.4 per
cent to Y234.7bn during the year, and interest payments increased by 34.8
per cent to Y15.5bn.
After-tax profits plunged 94.8 per cent to Y236m, due to a Y1.1bn
extraordinary loss on redemptions of its convertible bonds.
Daikyo, despite denials of severe financial problems, is no better off. The
company carries 1,800 units in completed inventories, and at the end of last
March, held Y214.8bn in short term borrowings and Y431.7bn in long term
debt.

FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Champion surfaces for Eurotunnel
investors - A look at the campaign to protect the interests of small
shareholders
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL'S small shareholders are starting to get restive for the first
time since the Channel tunnel builder and operator was floated on the stock
market nearly five years ago.
A shareholders' action group made its debut yesterday at Eurotunnel's annual
meeting in Paris, the first stage in a campaign to ensure they do not get
sidelined in any compromise deal with the constructors on cost over-runs.
The action group is headed by Mr Christian Cambier, a voluble former banker
who is founder and president of Prigest, a small Parisian fund management
group. He claims to have gathered support, over the two weeks since he
founded the action group, from about 1,000 out of Eurotunnel's 600,000
mainly small shareholders. They represent about 1 per cent of the equity
capital, he believes.
Mr Cambier was not out to make waves yesterday, simply to draw attention to
small shareholders' interests. 'We are preparing our defences because we
fear that the small shareholders could one day become the hostages in the
battle against Eurotunnel and the contractors,' he explained in an
interview.
Transmanche Link (TML), the Franco-British consortium of construction
companies, has said it is prepared to accept Eurotunnel shares or other
kinds of paper in part settlement of the more than Pounds 1bn of extra
payments it is seeking. What worries Mr Cambier is that small shareholders
might get no rights or reduced rights to subscribe to new shares issued in a
Eurotunnel capital increase to pay off the contractors. Small investors
could see their holdings seriously diluted as a result, he fears.
'We have been in the project all the way and we know it will be profitable.
We don't want the contractors to run off with everything at the last
minute,' he said.
He suspects that it might be in TML's interests to drive down the Eurotunnel
share price before such an offer, to help the contractors get the largest
possible percentage stake in Eurotunnel for their money.
This, at least, is how Mr Cambier interprets last month's controversial
remarks by Mr Martin Bouygues, chairman of the Bouygues construction group,
that he could not exclude Eurotunnel going bankrupt.
A sharp fall in Eurotunnel's share price followed, triggering an inquiry by
the Commission des Operations de Bourse, the market watchdog. Bouygues had
no comment yesterday.
Eurotunnel says it will agree to no rights issue or paper settlement with
TML without consulting an extraordinary general meeting first. Mr Andre
Benard, its French co-chairman assured shareholders yesterday that their
interests would be protected.
Nevertheless, said Mr Cambier: 'I want to collect maximum proxy powers for a
possible fight at the extraordinary general meeting, which I expect either
in the autumn or next spring . . . Eurotunnel is under enormous pressure,
from its 223 banks and the 10 contractors. I just want to make sure that we
get the opportunity to buy the new shares on the same day and at the same
price as everyone else.'
He has approached big French institutional investors, like the insurance
groups UAP, AGF and AXA to join the group. They have been sympathetic, but
have not yet joined - impeded, believes Mr Cambier, by the fact that they
already have large investments in the French construction companies.
Mr Cambier has taken up the flag partly on behalf of the clients - whose
Pounds 100m he has under management - who are Eurotunnel investors. He also
has a healthy sense of wariness over the problems small shareholders have
faced in Paris in recent years.
Before setting up Prigest 10 years ago, he was a fund manager with Compagnie
Financiere Edmond de Rothschild, so Mr Cambier has been in the Paris market
for long enough to see several examples of small shareholders being given
raw deals.

FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Eurotunnel shareholders to get
first dividend in year 2000
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By WILLIAM DAWKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
EUROTUNNEL yesterday said shareholders would get their first dividend soon
after the end of the decade, throwing uncertainty over earlier forecasts of
a pay-out in the year 2000, writes William Dawkins.
Mr Andre Benard, the French co-chairman, warned the annual meeting that cost
over-runs, changes in revenue forecasts and interest rates could alter
Eurotunnel's forecast of a profit before the end of the decade.
'In the current state of things, the payment of the first dividend will come
as soon as possible after the first profits, on condition that our
agreements with the banks allow it,' he said.
The tunnel is due to open in autumn next year, but will not be able to
provide a full rail service until summer 1994.
Technically, Eurotunnel is in breach of its bank covenants because of the
rise in the project's cost, from Pounds 4.8bn in 1987 to more than Pounds
8bn. So it can only go on drawing cash so long as the banks give waivers to
the covenant. The present waiver will keep the project going through August
and September, said Mr Benard.

FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Bosch checks slide in earnings
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ROBERT BOSCH, the German automotive components, telecommunications and
engineering group, is continuing its cost-cutting and productivity drive in
the face of intensifying world competition, although the slide in profits
has been checked, said Mr Marcus Bierich, the chief executive.
He reported a 3.5 per cent drop in net profits last year to DM540m (Dollars
338m), with turnover nearly 6 per cent higher at DM33.6bn. This followed a
steeper decline of almost 10 per cent in earnings to DM560m during 1990.
Mr Bierich said that turnover had improved by 5.4 per cent to DM14.3bn in
the first five months of 1992, with the percentage rise for the full year
likely to be about the same as last year. But this forecast was laden with
'considerable uncertainties' in view of the worldwide political and economic
situation.
The sharp drop in profits that had begun in 1990 was halted in the course of
1991, he said. But customers were still putting pressure on prices - this
has been especially true on the motor components side - and Bosch was no
longer able to pass on its higher labour costs to purchasers of its
products.
Some 4,000 jobs were shed last year within the Bosch group, which employed
177,000 people at the end of 1991. Excluding the additions from new
acquisitions, however, the decline was 8,000. A further 1,500 jobs had gone
so far this year through non-replacement of those leaving and early
retirements.
Mr Bierich said that the latest wage deal in the engineering industry would
raise domestic labour costs per hour by an average 5.5 per cent a year.
Since competition was too tough to allow more than minimal price rises,
productivity would have to rise at this rate to maintain profits and enable
Bosch to remain independent.
This meant no overall rise in group employment and further job cuts in
sectors with weak profits or poor growth.

FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: March family buys up shares to
merge banks
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By TOM BURNS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SPAIN's March family has been forced to buy out minority shareholders in its
investment bank Banco de Progreso before merging it with Banco Urquijo, the
medium-sized retail bank that it also controls.
The developments follow the failure of negotiations for the sale of Banco de
Progreso to La Caixa, the Barcelona-based savings bank.
Madrid's stock market commission yesterday suspended trading in Progreso
following an announcement that Corporacion Alba, the March family holding
which owns 40 per cent of Progreso's equity, was offering Pta2,700 per
Progreso share.
The price represents a 12.5 per cent premium and values Progreso's
five-branch network at Pta20.1bn (Dollars 205m).
La Caixa, Spain's biggest financial institution, had signed a letter of
intent to acquire Progreso a month ago. The savings bank had aimed to move
into corporate banking through the purchase, but it is understood to have
objected to the concentration of Progreso's loans and to the price set by
the March family.
The decision to merge Progreso with Banco Urquijo that has been suddenly
forced on the family involves a potentially messy partnership between two
distinctly different institutions. Originally, the March family had hoped to
boost Banco Urquijo, whose profits dropped by 20 per cent last year to
Pta3.7bn, with funds from the sale of Progreso.

</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ERCROS, the debt-burdened Spanish chemical conglomerate which is controlled
by the Kuwait Investment Office (KIO), edged closer to receivership
yesterday as negotiations broke down over the sale of a majority stake in
its fertiliser subsidiary to Freeport McMoran of the US.
Sources close to Ercros said the KIO, which owns 40 per cent of Ercros, was
unwilling to offer Freeport guarantees to cover future losses by the
subsidiary, Fesa-Enfersa. A final decision over the guarantees is expected
from KIO early next week.
The fertiliser company posted losses of Pta13.6bn (Dollars 138m) and is
responsible for half of Ercos' Pta99.1bn consolidated debt. A joint
fertiliser venture between Fesa-Enfersa and the New Orleans-based commodity
company is seen as the only way of averting Spain's biggest corporate
failure.
Negotiations for Freeport's acquisition of a 51 per cent stake in
Fesa-Enfersa opened last month at the instigation of Mr Javier de la Rosa,
the Barcelona financier who was KIO's chief Spanish executive until three
weeks ago.
However, the deal, which was for an unspecified amount, ran aground after Mr
de la Rosa severed his executive links with KIO and a new management team
was appointed that was wary of pumping new funds into Spanish assets.
If the deal is agreed, under the salvage plan the Barcelona financier, who
controls a 20 per cent stake in Ercros, would inject Pta10bn into the
conglomerate; Spain's publicly-owned bank, Banco Exterior, which is Ercros'
main creditor, would lead debt renegotiations; and KIO would be expected to
provide a further Pta25bn in capitalisation.
Telefonica de Espana, the Spanish telecommunications group which also owns
and operates telephone networks in Argentina and Chile, is interested in
acquiring a stake in Uruguay's state-owned Antel telephone company when it
is privatised, a Telefonica executive said in Montevideo, Reuter reports.
The Uruguayan government intends to sell off 60 per cent of the company to
foreign and local investors. It has not yet organised a tender for the sale
of Antel stock because there is a poll on July 5 calling for a referendum on
the privatisation proposals.

SVENSKA Handelsbanken, one of Sweden's leading commercial banks, has

market which is designed to strengthen its capital base, writes Robert

The bond issue was placed through the investment bank Merrill Lynch along
with Lehman Brothers and Morgan Stanley.
Mr Arne Martensson, chief executive at Handelsbanken said this was the first
time that the bank had negotiated a single bond issue in the American market
but this reflected the favourable international view of Handelsbanken's
financial strength.
Although hit by credit losses like the rest of Sweden's commercial banks,
Handelsbanken remains in a much stronger position than its competitors.
Operating profits for the first four months were SKr664m.

FT  26 JUN 92 / International Company News: Opel expects further fall in
profits after 19% decline
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW FISHER
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   FRANKFURT
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
OPEL, the German subsidiary of General Motors of the US, expects a further
drop in profits during 1992 after a 19 per cent decline in net income last
year to DM1.1bn (Dollars 687m), said Mr Gail Gunderson, the finance
director.
This year's earnings decline will reflect the shift in business away from
the domestic market, where the post-unification car sales boom has tailed
off, to export markets where margins are lower, he added.
In 1991, Opel raised turnover by 14 per cent to DM27bn. Because of the model
switch from the Kadett to the new Astra family car, however, production was
5 per cent lower at 995,000 units. This was one factor holding down profits,
with model start-up costs some DM300m higher than in 1990.
Opel also had to write off DM450m of the value of its investment in Saab,
the Swedish automotive company in which GM took a 50 per cent stake and
management control in 1989. In addition, Opel added to its pension reserves
and bore an initial DM125m loss through the acquisition of its east German
site in Eisenach where its new car plant will open in September.
To meet rising demand in Germany last year, Opel imported 228,000 vehicles
from GM plants in the UK and Spain, a move which also eroded profits. Thus
its total unit sales rose by 6 per cent to 1.2m cars, with a 27 per cent
jump in Germany to 758,000 and a 16.5 per cent decline abroad to 464,000.
This year, however, almost half of Opel's vehicles will be sold in export
markets against 38 per cent in 1991. 'We are selling more cars at lower
profit outside (Germany) and fewer cars at higher prices inside,' Mr
Gunderson said.
Mr Louis Hughes, the chief executive who has just been appointed president
of General Motors Europe, said Opel's output in the first five months of
1992 had risen by 3.3 per cent to 590,000 cars. The target for the full year
was more than 1.1m cars, a rise of 12 per cent, reflecting higher production
capacity for the new Astra.
He stressed the need to bring down costs and raise productivity at Opel,
saying the negative factors on the German industrial scene had reached 'a
dangerous level'. But he gave no further details of Opel's talks with unions
to reduce labour, especially at its main Russelsheim plant near Frankfurt.

Hardys &amp; Hansons, the Nottingham-based brewer, reported an 8 per cent fall
in pre-tax profits from Pounds 3.45m to Pounds 3.16m in the 26 weeks to
April 3.
The result was after a halving of dividend income and net interest
receivable to Pounds 488,000 (Pounds 974,000).
Turnover improved to Pounds 14.3m (Pounds 13.4m). Directors said that on a
like-for-like basis, excluding recently-purchased public houses, sales had
been down in line with the market, but the additional pubs had helped to
increase trading profits by 8 per cent.
Although earnings per share declined to 8.479p (9.183p) the interim dividend
is stepped up from 2.68p to 2.8p.

Chiltern Radio yesterday reported a reduced pre-tax loss of Pounds 179,000,
bearing out its warning that it would be unable to break even in its
seasonally difficult first half.
The deficit in the comparable period was Pounds 234,000, but for the whole
of 1990-91 the result was a profit of Pounds 114,000.
Sales in the first half to March 31 rose to Pounds 2.55m (Pounds 1.73m), but
the comparable figure included only three months contribution from
newly-acquired stations Galaxy Radio and Severn Sound. Losses per share
declined to 1.9p (2.5p).
The company has focused its efforts on attracting advertising from smaller
companies and has seen evidence of an improvement in sales. It will also
continue its efforts to gain another licence.
The directors have decided that it would not be prudent to pay an interim
dividend.

Greenwich Resources, the UK gold mining company, reported a pre-tax loss of
Pounds 558,000 for the six months to end-March against a restated loss of
Pounds 39,000 in the comparable period.
Of the loss Pounds 380,000 related to exceptional costs arising from the
restructuring of United Goldfields Corporation, redundancy costs and
provisions.
Operating income, which comprises the net income due to the group from the
Paddington Mine in Australia and the pilot processing plant in Venezuela,
fell from Pounds 182,000 to Pounds 74,000. The operating loss grew to Pounds
577,000 (Pounds 105,000).
Net interest receivable declined from Pounds 66,000 to Pounds 19,000 and
after tax of Pounds 81,000 (Pounds 152,000) losses per share were 0.9p
(0.3p).
Greenwich reported pre-tax profits of Pounds 108,000 from operating income

Scantronic Holdings, the alarms and signalling equipment group, announced
lower pre-tax profits of Pounds 2.54m for the year to March 31. Last time
they were Pounds 3.22m.
Turnover was Pounds 36.1m, against Pounds 42.9m, but the result last time
included Pounds 6m of turnover from Alarm Parts, since sold.
Mr Christopher Brookes, the chairman, said that minimum growth in overall
demand had been experienced but Scantronic had benefited from increased
market share. The north American activities had been helped by the
completion of a rationalisation programme.
For the current year, he said trading profits had been strong in the first
quarter and that the full-year performance should be enhanced by the
contribution of recently-released products, including those from the new
Arrowhead sensor division.
Operating profits fell from Pounds 3.74m - which included Pounds 317,000
from Alarm Parts - to Pounds 2.96m. The pre-tax figure was after a fall in
interest charged to Pounds 422,000 (Pounds 1.79m).
The directors are recommending an unchanged final dividend of 2.185p, which
holds the total at 2.975. Earnings per share fell to 2.18p (3.83p).
There was an extraordinary credit of Pounds 1.03m (Pounds 2.45m).

PROSPECT INDUSTRIES, the specialist engineer is paying Pounds 10.1m for
Davenport Holdings, which builds water cooling towers. Hull-based Prospect
also reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 737,000 for the six months to March
31, compared with profits of Pounds 112,000.
Davenport, which is Prospect's fourth acquisition in the past year, had
pre-tax profits of Pounds 1.9m on turnover of Pounds 11m in 1991. Net assets
at March 31 were Pounds 4.5m including net cash of Pounds 2.3m.
The consideration, being paid in three parts, will be satisfied by shares or
a combination of shares and loan notes at the option of Prospect.
Prospect blamed its fall into losses on the seasonality of its Dunn purchase
which was included in the interim results for the first time. However every
subsidiary, apart from Airmatic, the smallest company in the group, showed
improved results.
Group turnover for the six months was Pounds 14.7m (Pounds 5m). Losses per
share were 0.47p (0.11p earnings). The interim dividend has been increased
to 0.25p (0.1p) reflecting directors expectations.

FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Difficult trading keeps Brown &amp; Tawse loss
little changed at Pounds 1m
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANGUS FOSTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
BROWN &amp; Tawse, the steel and pipes distributor, yesterday announced a second
successive year of losses and cut dividends.
The company reported pre-tax losses of Pounds 975,000 in the year to March
31, a slight improvement from losses of Pounds 1.17m a year ago.
But operating profits fell from Pounds 4.13m to Pounds 1.36m and Mr Gil
Black, chairman, said trading remains difficult.
The proposed final dividend is being cut to 1.85p (2.85p) to make a total of
4.7p (5.7p). The shares fell 5p to 61p.
Turnover fell to Pounds 139.4m (Pounds 166.1m) as the company's main
construction and industrial markets were affected by recession.
This followed a decline at the interim stage when turnover fell to Pounds
72.3m (Pounds 90.8m) and a loss of Pounds 181,000 was announced (Pounds
2.17m profit).
Losses from bad debts increased to Pounds 1.2m (Pounds 730,000). There were
exceptional losses of Pounds 184,000 from rationalisations, net of a Pounds
614,000 exceptional gain on a pension cost adjustments.
Brown &amp; Tawse Plant, a distributor of rock breakers, is being closed,
leading to exceptional provisions of Pounds 425,000.
The company further reduced employees from 1,423 to 1,295. Stocks fell by
Pounds 6m to Pounds 22.5m while net borrowings fell to Pounds 16.1m (Pounds
19.5m), taking gearing down to 35 per cent (42 per cent).
Mr Black announced the appointment of Richard Wilson as chief executive,
following the resignation of Mr Keith Rae last year. Mr Wilson, chairman,
GKN Building Services Division, joins Brown &amp; Tawse in October.
The loss per share deteriorated to 2.7p (0.7p). There was a retained loss of
Pounds 2.39m (Pounds 2.08m).
COMMENT
Mr Wilson's departure from GKN to join Brown &amp; Tawse would appear brave. He
is joining a company which despite two years of thorough cost cutting has
failed to make a profit after interest costs since 1990. Although many of
the woes can be blamed on recession, the company's heavy exposure to
construction suggests recovery is far from imminent.
With most of the obvious costs taken out, Mr Wilson will presumably be
looking a little deeper, perhaps to find a cheaper way to run the company's
distribution network and reduce operating costs.
Forecasts for this year suggest another small loss or perhaps break even.
The dividend yield is now close to 10 per cent, suggesting another cut
cannot be ruled out.

eight months
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL CHEESERIGHT, Midlands Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
DISPOSAL of loss-making subsidiaries and over-capacity in the printing
sector held back the profits of Kalamazoo, the computer services and printed
systems group.
Pre-tax surplus for the eight months ended March were Pounds 611,000 against
Pounds 3.66m in its last full financial year, to July 1991, or Pounds 2.3m
for the eight months to March 1991.
Kalamazoo is changing its financial year end to March. It last reported in
March on the six months to last January and the updating of the accounts by
two months reflects little difference in its trading position.
The computer services business, which accounts for 66 per cent of group
business, continued to grow with a seven per cent increase in revenue from
one 8-month period to the next.
But the printed systems business saw most of its profits wiped out by the
recession, manifest in the over-capacity of the printing industry and a
decline in repeat orders.
The sale of US and New Zealand subsidiaries took Pounds 1.2m out of
operating profits.
'The group has negligible gearing and although there will be restructuring
costs as we reposition our printed systems business, we are confident of
profit growth in the coming year,' said Mr Peter Harrop, the chairman.
Earnings per share for the eight months to last March were nil.
The final dividend is 0.875p a share, making a total for the eight months of
1.4p. Payments for 1990/1991 were 2p.

his sixtieth birthday. Though an internal candidate has not been ruled out
to succeed him, it is understood that Mr Jon Foulds, the Halifax chairman,
believes that an outsider is needed to overhaul the society to face the
challenges of the banking markets in the late 1990s.
The two strongest internal candidates are Mr David Gilchrist, the group
general manager, and Mr Mike Whitehouse, the operations director who is in
charge of the day to day running of the building society's core business.
Mr Foulds is believed to be planning a much more radical shake-up of the
society and the upper echelons of its management.
He is thought to favour a banker or an industrialist as the next head of the
society.
His moves have revived speculation that Halifax may be reviewing a board
decision in June 1988 to remain mutually owned and not to follow Abbey
National with a stock market flotation.
At the time, most of Halifax's senior management were believed to favour the
flotation, but were overruled when a majority of the directors voted against
it.

FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Doubled sales in Poland help Rothmans
advance by 4.2%
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD GOURLAY
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
ROTHMANS International, the cigarette and luxury goods company, yesterday
reported a 4.2 per cent increase in profits despite a price cutting war in
Australia, one of its most important markets.
The main boost to growth came from a doubling of sales in Poland coupled
with higher prices in Canada and cost cutting in Germany.
Pre-tax profits rose from Pounds 542.5m to Pounds 565.2m on sales of Pounds
2.4bn (Pounds 2.3bn). Earnings per share rose 9.2 per cent to 85.7p and the
company is to pay a final dividend of 13p, up 11.1 per cent, giving a total
of 20.5p, up 10.8 per cent on the year.
The company is also splitting its ordinary 'B' shares, which are traded in
London, into two in an attempt to widen their appeal to investors.
The Australian operation was badly bit by the price war and the operating
result was struck after a higher-than-expected Pounds 28.7m rationalisation
cost in Europe and Australia.
Cash balances increased by Pounds 55m to Pounds 770m but investment income
fell from Pounds 65.4m to Pounds 58.5m as a result of lower average interest
rates.
The luxury goods interests, which are mainly a controlling interest in
Dunhill holdings, were hit by recession. But sales increased by 11 per cent
to Pounds 230m largely due to the purchase of substantial interests in
Alfred Dunhill's Japanese distributor. Operating profits rose from Pounds
55.1m to Pounds 55.7m.
During the year the tax rate fell from 36.8 per cent to 35.2 per cent.
COMMENT
A good week for cigarette makers. Fast in the tracks of Wednesday's US
Supreme Court judgment on smokers' lawsuits, that appears to limit their
avenues of attack, Rothmans yesterday demonstrated the industry's old cash
generating magic. Allowing for a price war in Australia and reorganisation
costs, which were higher than expected, cigarettes showed a 10 per cent
increase. Luxury goods through Cartier and Dunhill particularly, were also
ahead of expectations. Rothmans is, however, sitting on a Pounds 770m cash
mountain that it still does not appear to know how to use, even though some
of this pile is controlled by associates. Perhaps there is a case for a
higher dividend, but this argument has cut little ice with the South African
Rupert family since it took control by buying Philip Morris's stake in 1989.
With the legal threats in abeyance, if not entirely despatched, the shares
are looking on the cheap side based on a forecast of Pounds 605m of profits
this year, or earnings of 94p, which gives a prospective multiple below 11.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
Feedback, the USM-quoted designer and maker of computer peripheral,
technical education and electronic test equipment, fell Pounds 366,200 into
the red in the year to March 31, against profits of Pounds 57,500
previously.
Directors said that this first-ever loss reflected trading conditions and
was in part due to the low turnover at Feedback Inc and the costs of
integrating source computer systems into Feedback Data.
There had been considerable reorganisation and rationalisation throughout
the group.
On turnover down at Pounds 9.13m (Pounds 9.61m) there was an operating loss
of Pounds 275,100 (Pounds 328,600 profit). Losses per share emerged at 3.37p
(0.17p earnings) and there is no dividend.

Stoddard Sekers achieved a 30 per cent profits increase in what the company
termed 'a most testing period.'
On sales up 7 per cent at Pounds 46.1m (Pounds 43m) the pre-tax figure
advanced from Pounds 2.51m to Pounds 3.26m in the year to March 31.
The company makes Wilton and Axminster carpets and fabrics. Mr Hugh
Laughland, the chairman, said the widely-predicted rise in consumer
confidence had failed to materialise. Demand remained low and the current
year had started disappointingly.
The final dividend of 1.875p (1.95p) makes an increased total of 2.625p

The year ended with shareholders' funds at Pounds 19.4m (Pounds 18.5m)
borrowings of Pounds 330,000 (Pounds 590,000) and gearing at 1.7 per cent.

ABERDEEN Steak Houses Group, the restaurants operator, reported reduced
pre-tax losses of Pounds 422,000 in the 1991 year, compared with Pounds
3.27m. However the trading profit on continuing activities fell from Pounds
2.37m to Pounds 934,000.
Mr A Salih, chairman, said that against the background of the recession, the
second-half had increased business, but not enough to make up for the heavy
losses at the beginning of the year.
Sales for continuing activities were currently ahead of last year.
Total turnover fell 17 per cent to Pounds 13.3m (Pounds 16m). The figure of
Pounds 14m (Pounds 12.2m) for continuing activities was 12 per cent down.
Losses per share were 2.6p (23.5p).

<TEXT>
CALEDONIA Investments, in which the Cayzer family holds 46.2 per cent of the
shares, saw pre-tax profits decline to Pounds 34.7m (Pounds 35.3m) for the
year to March 31.
Mr Peter Buckley, chief executive, said the company was affected by falling
interest rates as it switched from British &amp; Commonwealth Holdings
preference shares and cash deposits to other investments.
Profits from trading activities rose to Pounds 6.9m (Pounds 1m), due to
higher input from Amber Industrial Holdings, in which Caledonia holds 75 per
cent.
However, this increase was offset by a fall in investment income to Pounds
18.6m (Pounds 23.2m) and net interest receivable from Pounds 13.9m to Pounds
12.2m.
Caledonia is proposing to purchase up to 10 per cent of its share capital at
355p a share - a small premium to Wednesday's closing price. The shares
yesterday rose by 23p to 362p.
Earnings per share fell from 25p to 24.1p.
An increased final dividend of 9.6p, takes the total for the year to 14.4p
(13.5p).

FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: First price cut wins approval - Profits
surge at Southern Electric and South Wales Electricity
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JULIET SYCHRAVA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SOUTH WALES Electricity will drop electricity prices by up to 2 per cent
from January, after cutting more than 450 jobs - around 15 per cent of its
present workforce - and reducing costs by about Pounds 4m.
The announcement, which makes the Cardiff-based regional electricity company
the first to cut electricity prices since privatisation two years ago, won
approval from the Department of Trade and Industry.
'I believe these reductions demonstrate that the benefits of privatisation
are coming through,' said Mr Tim Eggar, the energy minister.
The cuts, which mean about Pounds 1.50 to Pounds 2 off the average Pounds 80
to Pounds 90 quarterly electricity bill, were possible because South Wales
had cut costs by 6 per cent, the company said at its annual meeting
yesterday. That was the highest cut so far from any regional company.
South Wales, which is the smallest of the 12 regional companies, did not
rule out another tariff cut in future.
Southern Electric, which also announced its annual results yesterday, faced
questions from the City as to why it had not rewarded customers with a
similar move.
The contrast was sharp, because Southern only cut 3.7 per cent or Pounds
8.5m from its costs, but gave shareholders a dividend of 16.66p, up 15.3 per
cent, compared with South Wales' 14.8 per cent increase to 19.4p.
Southern Electric's pre-tax profit of Pounds 166.3m for the year ending
March 1992, up 57 per cent on last year's pro forma figure, also looked high
compared with the 28 per cent increase in South Wales' figure, to Pounds
72.5m.
Southern's earnings per share rose by 51 per cent to 47.8p and South Wales'
by 26 per cent to 50.3p.
But the companies' underlying profit growth - excluding exceptional items
and distortions - was closer. Southern Electric's profit grew by an
underlying 30 per cent, and South Wales' by 23 per cent. This came almost
entirely from the core distribution business, although sales were depressed.
Southern Electric sold a modest 2.2 per cent more electricity, and sales in
South Wales were stagnant.
Growth came from cost cutting, and higher tariffs, which gave South Wales a
Pounds 70.4m operating profit in the core business, compared with Pounds
47.5m the previous year.
Southern Electric's core business made an operating profit of Pounds 172.5m,
a rise of 34 per cent.
Both companies incurred exceptional charges as they restructured their
retail operations and shed jobs in the main business - Pounds 11.2m for
South Wales and Pounds 8.5m for Southern Electric.
However, while Southern merged its retail operations with Eastern's in April
1992, South Wales sold its business to South Western Electricity, shedding
355 jobs.
Southern's retail business showed a Pounds 3.3m loss, and is not expected to
break even until the year ending March 1994.
Contracting was loss-making for both companies. Southern lost Pounds 2.6m on
the business, and South Wales about Pounds 1m.
Both companies plan to take more costs out of the core business, though
Southern gave a firmer target of 500 more jobs to go or 6.3 per cent of the
workforce next year.
However, South Wales is targeting a 1 per cent cut in costs overall, while
South Wales is forecasting a dramatic 5 per cent real cut.
Turnover for the smaller South Wales Electricity amounted to Pounds 590m
(567m) while Southern Electric achieved Pounds 1.75bn (Pounds 1.55bn).
COMMENT
Whether or not the halo South Wales was strategically wearing yesterday
slips in future scarcely matters. The company's price cut will please the
City even if it is a temporary sop to the regulator, and the company's cost
cutting was tangible enough. And while Southern's promise of 'critical mass'
from its retail merger made South Wales' decision to ditch the whole
lossmaking outfit look happily straightforward and likely to keep Welsh
Water from making more predatory moves on the company. Southern - with its
seven new businesses and new retail venture - inevitably looks somewhat
uncertain by comparison even though the company has a strong management
record. That uncertainty casts a shadow over the company's hefty dividend
rise, which the company implied would be a one-off. Analysts forecast
pre-tax profit of between Pounds 170m and Pounds 200m for Southern Electric,
and Pounds 85m to Pounds 95m for South Wales. That puts the companies on a
prospective p/e of 6.5 to 7.7 for Southern, and 6.6 to 8.3 for South Wales.
A dividend of between 18p and 18.7p is forecast for Southern, and 21.2p to
21.8p for South Wales.

FT  26 JUN 92 / UK Company News: Hongkong Bank wins 64% of Midland
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD and SIMON HOLBERTON
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   LONDON, HONG KONG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
HONGKONG and Shanghai Banking Corporation yesterday won overwhelming
acceptance from Midland Bank shareholders for its Pounds 3.6bn takeover
offer, giving it a total of 63.58 per cent of the British clearer's share
capital.
Counting was still proceeding last night and the final level of acceptance
will be announced this morning. The merger will be declared unconditional in
every respect on July 10.
The prospect of a significant block of Midland shares lying outside Hongkong
Bank's control seems to have been excluded. Mr Derek Netherton, director of
Schroders, the merchant bank advising Hongkong Bank, said that he knew of no
institutional shareholder which had rejected the offer.
The merger creates a new global banking group with assets of Pounds 145bn,
among the world's ten largest banks and well ahead of any other British
bank.
Within an hour of the victory announcement Mr William Purves, Hongkong Bank
chairman, told the Financial Times that he intended to proceed with the
merging of the two banks' operations as rapidly as possible. 'People in
Midland and my group want to get on with it.'
Top managers at the two banks are to meet in 10 days' time at a venue
outside London to take key decisions on the practical steps involved in the
merger.
Mr Purves said that he expected the bulk of the merger to be accomplished
with a year, much of it in the first six months.
He cited the consolidation of the treasury operations of the two banks as an
urgent priority. Operations in London, New York and Tokyo had to be brought
together 'as soon as possible'.
London would be the headquarters of the new, enlarged treasury which would
also take responsibility for handling the group's top corporate customers,
he said. The treasury would trade under the Midland name but be headed by Mr
Bernard Asher, Hongkong Bank's most senior executive in London.
Mr Purves said however that the merger would be 'a partnership of key people
in key areas'. These people would come from both banks.
'There are many challenges ahead and we will get down to them now that the
uncertainty has been removed.'
Preliminary figures last night showed that Midland shareholders owning some
351.3m shares, or 44.5 per cent, had accepted the offer, with half of them
electing to take the 60p cash alternative instead of the bonds.
Midland shares rose 24p to finish at 454p last night.
The steering committee of the FT-SE 100 index is considering when exactly to
replace Midland in the index with Hongkong Bank's shares. It is believed the
change will not be made for about two weeks.

THE special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra scandal during the Reagan
presidency said yesterday he was investigating whether officials at the
'highest level of the government' broke the law over a 1985 US arms shipment
to Iran via Israel, Reuter reports from Washington.
Mr Lawrence Walsh said his investigation, which is in its final phase, was
expected to be concluded this summer and he had yet to decide on bringing
additional criminal charges.
The secret White House operation sold arms to Iran in 1985-86, violating an
official US trade embargo, to try to win the release of US hostages held in
Lebanon.
Mr Walsh said in a special report to Congress the alleged cover-up involved
inquiries by the presidentially appointed Tower commission, Congress and his
own 5 1/2 -year investigation.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Letter: IMF not prevaricating over Russian economic reform
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From SHAILENDRA J ANJARIA
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Like you, the International Monetary Fund would like to see economic
reform in Russia proceeding as rapidly as possible (Leading Article: 'Russia
and the IMF', and 'IMF will advance Moscow Dollars 1bn', June 24). I am also
glad that you recognise the serious risk of hyperinflation. However, your
criticism of the IMF for prevaricating shows that you and your correspondent
in Moscow, John Lloyd, have been seriously misinformed.
In particular, it is not true that the IMF has insisted on balancing the
budget. We recognise the case for some foreign financing of the budget
deficit. Furthermore, your claims that the IMF has been insisting that oil
prices should be allowed to rise to world market levels this year and that
it has been trying to force all states of the former USSR to remain within
the rouble area are totally untrue.
The IMF has always understood the reason for the Russian government's wish
to have a gradual rise in oil prices to world levels over a two-year period,
as set out in the government's memorandum of economic policies in February.
The Fund's position on the choice of currency is set out clearly in the
managing director's speech at Georgetown University in April. The Fund
co-operated very closely with Estonia, the first state of the ex-USSR to
introduce its own currency.
Finally, the agreement between Mr Gaidar and the managing director last week
related to the procedures for speeding up the remaining work and not, as
implied by your reporter, to an agreement on a particular programme which
the Fund would support. Negotiations will soon resume in Moscow with a view
to reaching agreement on policies that we could recommend for international
support.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Letter: Where analysis on pensions went awry
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr LAWLESS BETHUNE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Reading your editorial of June 20 ('Pensions after Maxwell'), I agreed
with much of what you said. The law does need tightening to protect pension
scheme beneficiaries from rapacious or dishonest employers. In some places,
however, your analysis goes awry.
Take cross subsidy, for example. You attack its use in final salary
arrangements, but only a few sentences earlier you advocate it for a
compensation scheme. In both cases, surely, risks are being shared and some
participants will inevitably subsidise others?
You conclude by suggesting that personal pensions would be the solution. For
some people they are, but only rarely is a personal pension an individual
portfolio of assets. The overwhelming majority are invested with insurance
companies, which pool all the premiums to operate massive cross subsidy.
You have in the past criticised insurers for overselling their products and
penalising people who back out early, even through no fault of their own. Is
it really the answer to demolish employers' schemes and move millions of
employees into insurance policies? Presumably you would also want the civil
servants' own scheme switched into personal pensions?

FT  26 JUN 92 / Letter: Interest rates' influence on consumption
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Messrs COLIN HARTE and ALAN DOYLE
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, Michael Lipton (Personal View, June 24) has a very strange idea of the
role of real interest rates in influencing inter-temporal consumption and
production decisions. He is absolutely correct when he says that 'long-term
interest rates in real terms are a classic market signal'. Rather than
encouraging present consumption and resource depletion, however, they
encourage the exact opposite. Which is precisely why they are used as a
macro-economic policy measure - to encourage saving rather than consumption.
The example of the Indian farmer is misleading. Faced with high long-term
real interest rates, the 'fierce arithmetic signal' is to use less capital
intensive production methods - appropriate technology in the jargon (which
may well encourage lower but more sustainable production) - rather than to
go for the high return extractive production path. Only in the short term
can it be claimed that high real interest rates will force production of the
extractive rather than sustainable variety - and high real interest rates
have been around since the very late 1970s.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Letter: Pace-setters in public sector pay
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   From Mr R RENCH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Sir, While concurring with everything else which was said, I cannot endorse
the statement in your editorial, 'Regulating the water industry' (June 22),
that 'water company chairmen and chief executives - (were) probably
underpaid when nationalised'.
Ever since they were set up in 1974 to their demise, rather than being the
Cinderellas, the water authorities were the pace-setters for executive pay
in the public sector - and no more so than in the case of those at the top.
And, if one took into account the 'perks', the differentials were even more
obvious.
Privatising the water authorities did not alter the essential nature of the
tasks to be performed. (In fact, at least 10 per cent of former duties were
transferred to the National Rivers Authority). With no competitors and a
captive market, no entrepreneurial skills whatsoever are required; the job
to be done is purely administrative. Comparisons with the lCIs and Lonrhos,
etc of this world, where 'real business' takes place, are false. The job is
certainly no more onerous, and perhaps even less, than that of running a
large local authority such as Birmingham or Manchester and, accordingly,
remuneration should be similar.
At a stretch, one might have been able to overlook the outrageous pay
increases in the water companies if, by some miracle, the previous
oft-repeated pledge that privatisation would result in consumers paying
lower charges than if the industry remained in the public sector had
materialised. But, of course, it has not. It must be the biggest 'con' to be
perpetrated on the British public since that of Horatio Bottomley of First
World War infamy. When will it learn that as far as private monopolies are
concerned, not unnaturally the interests of the consumer will always be
secondary.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Sunday trading
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
YESTERDAY'S DECISION by the House of Lords on Sunday trading brings welcome
clarity. The Shops Act 1950 remains the law of the land unless repealed or
declared invalid under the Treaty of Rome by the European Court. Local
authorities can seek injunctions stopping illegal Sunday trading without
having to promise compensation if the law is declared invalid. If it is, the
UK government could be liable to pay compensation to shops for loss of
profits on Sunday trading.
That is a wise judgment, because it places responsibility for sorting out
the mess over Sunday trading firmly with the government. Ministers can no
longer stand back and blame local authorities for allowing the law to be
flouted.
Their next step is clear: the Shops Act should be repealed without delay.
Sunday trading provides benefits to consumers in convenience and  - by
making more efficient use of capital - lower prices. A quick bill is needed
before the sabbatarians and shopworkers' unions mobilise the opposition. The
threat of having to pay millions of pounds of compensation to supermarket
groups if the European Court overturns the Shops Act should focus the Home
Secretary's mind.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Leading Article: Calm nerves in Lisbon
</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
IT WOULD not be surprising if several of the EC leaders assembled in Lisbon
today caught themselves wishing they were somewhere else. At their last
meeting, in Maastricht, they produced the Treaty on European Union. That
left two big issues to be discussed in Lisbon: the budget for the next five
years, and the enlargement of the Community. But the Danish people's
rejection of their earlier handiwork has confused the debate on both issues,
and has helped to thrust another - subsidiarity  - on to the table. In
addition, they must be well aware that this is their last chance to come up
with an agreed position on agricultural subsidies which could form the basis
of a needed breakthrough in the Uruguay Round at or before the G7 summit in
Munich the week after next.
All four issues are important and difficult. The budget is so divisive that
the Portuguese presidency has decided to seek agreement at this meeting only
on general guidelines rather than specific figures. But Spain threatens to
veto the opening of enlargement negotiations unless it gets the full 'Delors
Two' package, designed to double the receipts of the poorer members by 1997.
In support of their position the Spaniards cite the agreement reached at
Maastricht, that the budget must be agreed before enlargement negotiations
can start. That is correct, but does not mean it is necessarily in Spain's
interest to block agreement by insisting on a figure its partners are
unwilling to accept. Nor, however, is the British and Dutch opposition to
any raising of the ceiling before 1997 likely to prove tenable.
Should enlargement talks wait also upon ratification of the Maastricht
Treaty? No, say the British, Germans and Portuguese, arguing that Danish
fears of European Union can be allayed by the spectacle of fellow
Scandinavians negotiating to join that same Union. Yes, say most other
member states and the Commission, arguing that it must be clear to the
applicants what Union it is they are trying to join.
Meanwhile the Commission is scrambling to make Maastricht more acceptable by
offering powers back to the member states. This newfound zeal responds to a
widespread feeling, by no means confined to Denmark, that the EC is getting
too centralised and interventionist. But, as Mr Jacques Delors and others
point out, much of its interventionism has arisen from the anxiety of some
member states to make sure that others abide by the rules. Subsidiarity and
the single market - both concepts dear to the British heart - are to some
extent in contradiction with each other. Too much subsidiarity will make it
easier for Germany to ban imports of British lawn-mowers, or for France to
subsidise the research costs of its favourite national industries.
The issue is a complex one, and cannot be solved by an impulsive bonfire of
EC competences. Nor should the Commission be seen as the only sinner. It is
the Council (of Ministers) that makes EC law, and sometimes it is less the
powers themselves that are objectionable than the way they are exercised.
The least one could ask is that legislation be debated and enacted in
public, rather than behind closed doors.
In fact all three issues - the budget, enlargement, subsidiarity - are ones
over which the EC can afford to take some time, considering them in
conjunction with the Danish problem to which they are all connected. The
Uruguay Round is the only really urgent issue.
Put at its starkest, the EC faces a choice between risking the defeat of
Maastricht in the French referendum, and risking the collapse of the world
trading system through the failure of the Uruguay Round. Of the two, the
latter disaster would be the graver.

<TEXT>
The government's policy on community care is potentially as damaging as it
is little-noticed. It could evolve into a juicy election issue for an alert
opposition. The fateful decisions were taken at a special meeting of
ministers on Tuesday.
The policy affects all except the very richest of infirm elderly voters,
and, potentially, all families with retired grandparents. When Mrs Margaret
Thatcher came to office in 1979 there were half a million people aged over
85 in Britain; when Mr John Major next faces the electorate in 1996 or 1997
there will be twice as many. What was decided this week was to remove the
power of choice from this great grey army.
Old folk who cannot afford to pay for care, and whose families will not
undertake it, will be delivered into the hands of officials. Trained
'caseworkers' will decide what is good for them and prescribe it. What?
Surely that is wrong. I am afraid not - although it is true that when you
consider the results of Tuesday's deliberations you have to shake your head.
Perhaps Labour won the election after all? Surely it could not be a
Conservative cabinet committee that deliberated on Tuesday? Not under the
chairmanship of Mr Citizen's Charter Major?
You need to step back to understand what happened. Local authorities stopped
expanding the provision of old people's homes before 1979, just as the
explosion of the elderly population began. Of necessity, a new system was
created. Pressure groups worked on the administrators.
What were called 'board and lodging allowances' were gradually extracted
from local social security officials, a practice formalised under Mrs
Thatcher in 1983. Anyone dependent on income support and in possession of
less than Pounds 3,000 (now Pounds 6,000) in capital could get much of the
cost of accommodation in a home paid for by the department of social
security. The middle classes quickly learned how to impoverish Granny, take
the government's money and top it up to meet the cost of placing her in
residential or nursing care.
The result was the growth of a new industry. Since 1980 the number of places
in private residential homes has more than quadrupled, to over 160,000,
according to Laing &amp; Buisson, specialists in healthcare publishing.
Meanwhile, the number of local authority places has fallen by 14,500 to
120,000. Since 1987 the number of private nursing home places has risen from
52,000 to above 135,000. Meanwhile NHS long stay geriatric places have risen
by a mere 2,000, to 45,000. This new private sector business is just what
Tories are supposed to favour. There are a few big players, and a great many
mom-and-pop shops. You will have guessed the flaw: Laing &amp; Buisson estimates
that about 40 per cent of the revenue is taxpayers' money.
It is the size of that subsidy that lies behind the move to community care.
It has grown from a mere Pounds 10m or so in 1980 to over Pounds 1.6bn now.
I am told that when Sir Roy Griffiths first advised Mrs Thatcher of the need
for a change he intimated that it would not save any cash. He saw his new
system as a means of improving care. Mrs Thatcher bought the idea because,
like the Treasury, she saw it as a means of capping costs. She delayed its
implementation because she did not want local authorities to have a hand in
administering the system, but gave in when it was demonstrated that all
other options were worse. For example, if the NHS took it on it would be
harder to decant geriatrics from very expensive hospitals to less expensive
homes or the relatively cheap 'community'.
Mr Major delayed implementation last year because he did not want poll tax
bills inflated. Some ministers - among them, it is said, Mr Kenneth Clarke,
Mr John Patten and Mr Michael Howard - voiced doubts on Tuesday but the now
familiar argument, that all other options are worse, won the day. The health
secretary, Mrs Virginia Bottomley, may have won agreement that the
transitional costs will be earmarked, so that the recipient local
authorities do not spend the money on other things, but her department will
not be sure until the minutes are circulated. If there is 'earmarking',
pressure groups will be able to see how much, or how little, is spent on
care for the very old.
The Treasury motivation is simple. It wants to hide what it is doing. There
is no soppy talk of 'open government' in that department. The present
system, which continues until the end of March 1993, is demand-driven.
'Community care' will be cash-limited. It will be phased in over about four
years, as those on existing grants die off. Local authorities will
administer it, but they will be capped. They will have an in-built incentive
to employ caseworkers who recommend the provision of 'home helps' and
meals-on-wheels at a far lower cost than paying for places in residential
homes. When they do select homes they will use their purchasing power to
drive prices down. It is a political time-bomb.

   THREE GIANT economies
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
China, India and Russia - are now engaged in the same task: turning away
from central planning and towards the free market. With 40 per cent of the
world's population between them, what happens in these three economies is
more important for the world's future than almost anything else. All three
face huge problems. But all three also possess certain advantages. India's
is the possession of a sophisticated, if distorted, market economy.
What India has needed is a government that would stop stopping things from
happening. Mr Narasimha Rao's appears to be such a government. It deserves
continued, if highly conditional, support from the group of western aid
donors meeting in Paris today.
The payments crisis of June 1991, which started off the unprecedentedly deep
round of reforms, was, as the government of India's own Economic Survey
notes, a reflection of a 'loss of confidence in the government's ability to
manage the situation'. Behind that loss of confidence was India's
progressive fiscal deterioration. Its economy grew faster in the 1980s, at
some 5 1/2 per cent a year, than it had in the 1970s, but it did so on
borrowed money and was, therefore, living on borrowed time.
Fortunately, the new government - under the intellectual leadership of Dr
Manmohan Singh, the finance minister - seized the opportunity to introduce
not only stabilisation measures, but structural reforms as well. Long needed
liberalisation of trade and industrial policies were, therefore, added to a
sharp fiscal correction and devaluation of the rupee.
The package was judged worthy of additional external support and this it
duly received, notably from the International Monetary Fund and the World
Bank. Now the government seeks another Dollars 3bn in exceptional aid -
Dollars 2.4bn from the IMF and the World Bank and Dollars 0.6bn from
bilateral donors.
Has India done enough to justify continued support? It has. Has it done
enough to set India on the sustained high growth path that its people
deserves? It has not. Now, in fact, comes the hard part.
The two budgets put forward by Dr Singh have reduced the budget to a
projected level of 5 per cent of gross domestic product in 1992-93, but
important forms of waste - the fertiliser subsidy, for example - remain.
Monetary policy is too loose and, with a poor monsoon feared, inflation may
be higher than the people will tolerate.
The financial scandal in Bombay demonstrates the need for still more
financial reform, combined with fiercer supervision. No less important are
unification of the exchange rate, along with a depreciation to compensate
for the lowering of India's excessively protective tariffs. Only thus can
India hope for what it needs most: an export miracle rivalling those of
countries to its east. In addition, both privatisation and an exit policy
for unviable enterprises must be put in train, regardless of the political
difficulties.
The challenges are great and the lobbies opposed to the changes - farmers,
industrialists and organised labour - are politically formidable. Bringing
about radical reforms in a huge, poverty-stricken democracy could never be
straightforward. There is already fear that the government is drifting. But
there are no realistic alternatives, as the government knows. The west, for
its part, should make it clear that it will support reform, but only so long
as it is reform that it supports.
As has been true of many other developing countries, it was the threat of
default that concentrated the government's mind. For this reason alone,
support must not only be conditional, it should also be limited both in
extent and in time. India should be given exceptional aid now, but the aim
must be for India to stand soon on its own two feet.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Arts: Panufnik memorial concert
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD FAIRMAN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The programme opened with the first British performance of the Tenth
Symphony. About 20 minutes long, this presents a businesslike profile -
ideas well organised, orchestral textures clear-headed, the piece as a whole
firmly decided not to outstay its welcome. There is an articulate air about
its style of composition which might be taken as a feature of Andrzej
Panufnik's work.
Since the composer's death in the autumn last year, his music has been left
to speak for itself. Panufnik was born and educated in Poland, where he
spent his early years deeply engaged in all aspects of that country's
musical life. In 1954, however, he moved to England and it was here that he
spent his mature years, first as a conductor (with the City of Birmingham
Symphony Orchestra), then as composer, becoming knighted in 1991.
For this memorial concert, given at the Barbican Hall on Wednesday, there
were two major works new to London audiences still to be heard. The Tenth
Symphony, played with that swaggering virtuosity that the London Symphony
Orchestra can always bring to 20th-century music, made a splendid opener - a
little more than an orchestral showpiece too at the end, where it dies away
in pages of some spiritual beauty.
Then we had the first performance of the Cello Concerto, commissioned by the
LSO and performed by Mstislav Rostropovich. On an occasion like this one
dearly wants to enjoy and admire an important new piece, but for all
Rostropovich's characteristically involved playing and what seemed a fine
account of the orchestral part under Hugh Wolff, this score simply did not
put forward the same individual personality afforded by the symphony.
The concerto is in two movements. With Panufnik's love for geometric forms,
they are reflections of each other and each palindromic within themselves.
The first is an adagio, which stirs promisingly into life, but then meanders
inconsequentially. The second movement is a spiky scherzo and this just
seems poised to engage weightier matters in the cadenza, when the orchestra
signs off abruptly and it is all over.
There is a limited amount of expressive potential in the concerto, but what
there was Rostropovich delivered with his customary, whole-hearted abandon.
Even in Dvorak's Cello Concerto, which followed after the interval, there
was not a sign of staleness creeping in, however many times the cellist must
have played this music in his lifetime. His spontaneity has never deserted
him.

<TEXT>
The Rambert season continues at the Royalty Theatre with a second programme,
whose centre is a much-mentioned novelty for the company by Merce
Cunningham. This Touchbase is one of the few pieces that Cunningham has made
for an ensemble other than his own, though its creation is also shared with
the choreographer's troupe. It can not be coincidental that the evening also
offers us a chance to see apprentice work by two Rambert dancers - Mark
Baldwin and Paul Old - whose debuts are strongly influenced by Cunningham's
manner, since his has been a defining aesthetic for Rambert during recent
years. What is ironic is that these disciple creations are so much fresher
and more appealing to the eye than the work of the master.
Touchbase is characteristic Cunningham in its disarming lack of obvious
structure. The seven dancers go blithely about their business against the
yellow luminosities of Mark Lancaster's set, with a pair of white gates to
mark their comings and goings. They wear disastrous beach outfits - the
piece has an out-of-doors feel to it - and various whistlings and clankings
are made by Michael Pugliese's score, which only lacks a voice saying 'I'm
sure there's something wrong with the central heating; it's making the most
dreadful noise'. The dancers pose and stretch; Paul Old indulges in a
vestigial hornpipe; Amanda Britton, Alexandra Dyer, Sarah Warsop and Shelley
Baker move beautifully, and the result looks like Cunningham parodying his
own most hallowed procedures. The choreography, I gather, was in part
'generated' by a computer. Luddites, arise]
Far more enjoyable Mark Baldwin's Island to Island and Paul Old's Still
Dance. The first is a light-hearted, light-footed study in which the dance
sometimes looks as if it is being fast-forwarded, so quick and flashing its
effects. A sound-track makes faintly Polynesian noises; the movement and the
dancers are alert, handsome (in nice, anonymous clothes), and while paying
his debts to his elders, Baldwin shows himself his own man as a creator. He
treats his dancers felicitously - Sarah Warsop soaring in big jumps; John
Kilroy ebullient in step; Jacqueline Jones radiant and contemplative - and
the dance has a pristine air. Very touching.
Paul Old's Still Dance is performed in silence. Four dancers move quietly,
and Old's sense of harmony - a feeling that effects are balanced one against
the other; that every action has its counter-action, and every movement its
echoing response - gives the choreography a delicate but perceptible
architectural order. It is refreshing to watch. The dancing of the company
in all three works was exemplary. Lighting was excellent.
The Rambert Dance Company is at the Royalty Theatre until June 27, with
varied programmes. Sponsors include Digital Equipment Company and the
National Westminster Bank.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By MALCOLM RUTHERFORD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
CP Taylor was a dramatist of prodigious output, better known in Scotland and
the north east than in London. When he died in 1981 at the age of 52, he had
written more than 70 plays, none of them before he was 30. His reputation
since has been rising steadily and his works will be much performed at this
year's Edinburgh Festival.
Taylor once said that he would be happy if half a dozen of them were
remembered. Whether Schippel, The Plumber would have been among his top six
is doubtful, since it is not typical of other work that I have read. It is
an adaptation of a piece by Carl Sternheim and set in Imperial Germany,
1913. Its potential to dazzle, however, must have been always there. It had
a West End run starring Harry Secombe in 1975.
The original Schippel was fiercely satirical. It is about bourgeois snobbery
on the eve of the first world war and contains some notable grovelling by
the middle classes to royal blood. It also sends up that very Germany
tendency to seek national harmony through music.
By now, whatever Taylor may have thought himself, the satire is dead, and
Schippel emerges as a thoroughly enjoyable comedy which occasionally moves
into high class farce. The aim of this group of solid bourgeois citizens is
to win the crown for singing quartets for the fourth year running. Since one
of their members has died, it is necessary to fill the gap. The choice falls
on Schippel, who has a tenor voice of which any German would be proud. But
as Schippel is only a plumber, and illegitimate to boot, his inclusion
creates social problems.
The solution comes in Schippel being allowed to marry the fetchingly
beautiful sister (Kate Buffery) of the leader of the leader of the quartet,
though not before the sister has had a romantic fling, which she expects to
continue, with the local prince. Being from different ends of the social
scale, the prince and the plumber get on perfectly well with each other. As
the prince remarks, 'it's just like Shakespeare - the prince and the
bastard'.
Jeremy Sams's production contains a profusion of German music (especially
Schubert) and some excellent singing. James Saxon as Schippel is several
times enthusiastically applauded for his rendering of the various Lieder.
That does not often happen to an actor. Saxon can act as well: note his
initial entry when he starts to eat the cream cake.
There is also a wonderful balcony scene with conscious echoes of Romeo and
Juliet: 'It's horribly difficult in the circumstances,' says Philip Franks
as the prince, 'to avoid cliches.' The set, which includes the balcony and
is designed by Lez Brotherston, is outstanding. The moon shines: the whole
stage is used to the full and when the top of the grand piano is raised,
even that reveals scenic surprises. The opening is a trifle slow; it belies
the fun that is to come.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PAUL DRIVER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The London Opera Festival, running throughout June, is currently presenting
an evening of Michael Nyman's music at the Shaw Theatre. In the first half
the Endymion Ensemble, unconducted, play suites of the music Nyman has
written for films by Peter Greenaway: The Draughtsman's Contract, Zed and
Two Noughts and Drowning by Numbers.
The second half affords the premiere staging (by David Meyer) of an operatic
work which Nyman has derived from a television film in which he was involved
as composer and more: Letters, Riddles and Writs, a portrait of Mozart, with
a text drawn from documentary sources by the film's director, Jeremy Newson.
I found the first half quite hard to take. The ensemble is amplified (not
very skilfully), and it comes at one with a painful punch in the ear.
Nyman's minimalist-repetitive-rhythmic style has brightness and felicity,
often a seductive catchy charm. He is ingenious in spinning his own
pop-variations out of themes and motives from music of the past, Purcell's,
say, or Mozart's.
A piece like In Re Don Giovanni (not played at the Shaw Theatre), based on
Leporello's 'Catalogue Aria' is so unforgettable that the original now
sounds as though Mozart had allowed himself to be over-influenced by Nyman.
But the raucousness of Nyman's scores and the jigging motions they seem to
require from their performers - bows fly up and down like shuttles, trombone
slides work like pistons, bodies hippy-shake-shake - can be a mite
off-putting. The ensemble on Wednesday night, lit in cool and sexy
fluorescent hues, looked just like a busy sewing machine.
The chamber opera, half an hour long, featuring only two singers (and the
Endymion Ensemble), was a witty and haunting investigation of Mozart's
relationship to his father when it began life as the first of six Not Mozart
films, devised by Annette Morreau and shown (five of them, at least) on BBC
2 at the end of the 1991 bicentenary year.
Nyman has altered it considerably for stage presentation, not as far as I
could tell for the better, but one could tell little from this poor account
of the piece. The mise-en-scene - a spread of manuscripts, a rising
candle-chandelier, a daubed curtain with an inset window - was dull to
adequate. Counter-tenor Jonathan Peter Kenny as Mozart was unsure of
himself, and bass Martin Nelson in the triplicate role of father Leopold,
Sarastro and the critic Naegli thoroughly incoherent. Ute Lemper, the
original Wolfgang, was sorely missed, as was a conductor to keep the singers
at their places. The ensemble, heard from behind the curtain and on
loudspeakers inside the auditorium, was little more than a throb of raw
energy.
Nyman's music is entirely adapted from Mozart's. Both composers were garbled
to death on Wednesday. Perhaps things will have improved by tonight.

Rob Margetts (above left), the 45-year-old chief executive of ICI's Tioxide
business, has been appointed to the main ICI board in a move which marks him
out as a rising star in the increasingly elderly executive team running
Britain's biggest chemicals company.
Margetts, who is a Cambridge graduate in chemical engineering, has been
respon-sible for restructuring the recently acquired Tioxide business.
Before that he had been the general manager in charge of personnel and
director of engineering. He will be the youngest member of an executive team
whose average age is in the upper 50s.
Although ICI has not disclosed what role Margetts will play after he joins
the board on September 1, he may shoulder some of the responsibilities of
Frank Whiteley who is retiring as deputy chairman on reaching ICI's normal
retirement age of 62 in November.
Alan Pedder, 54, is to take over as chairman and chief executive of Tioxide,
following Margetts' promotion. Pedder is currently managing director of
ICI's international polyurethanes business and before that was managing
director of ICI Fibres.
*****
Meanwhile, Sir Richard Greenbury, chairman of Marks and Spencer, has been
appointed a non-executive director of ICI.
Sir Ralph Robins (above right), chief executive and deputy chairman of

FT  26 JUN 92 / FT Law Report: Enforcement case cannot be argued

AIGLON LTD AND L'AIGLON SA v GAU SHAN COMPANY LIMITED
Queen's Bench Division (Commercial Court): Mr Justice Hirst: June 10
1992
A MAREVA injunction freezing a company's assets pending grant of leave to
enforce an arbitration award against it will be discharged if there is no
good arguable case for enforcement in that the award is a nullity as against
the company, the arbitrators having exceeded their jurisdiction by deciding
that it was party to the contract out of which the dispute arose.
Mr Justice Hirst so held when proposing to grant an application by L'Aiglon
SA (SA) to set aside a Mareva injunction and an order for disclosure of
assets obtained against it by Gau Shan Ltd.
(The injunction has since been continued by the judge, on fresh grounds  -
see next Wednesday's law report. The reasoning based on enforcement
proceedings still stands.)
HIS LORDSHIP said the litigation arose out of the award of the Technical
Appeal Committee of the Liverpool Cotton Association in favour of Gau Shan
against Aiglon Ltd, an English company, and L'Aiglon SA, a Swiss company.
On May 1 1992 Mr Justice Gatehouse granted an application by Gau Shan for
Mareva injunctions, including an order for disclosure of assets, against
both Ltd and SA.
The present application was by SA only, to set aside the Mareva and
disclosure orders as against it. Gau Shan counterclaimed as against SA under
section 26 of the Arbitration Act 1950, for leave to enforce the award in
the same manner as a judgment.
The dispute arose under a contract of sale of 3,000 tonnes of Benin raw
cotton, in which the sellers were described as Ltd, and which was signed on
behalf of Ltd and Gau Shan.
SA's case for discharge of the Mareva and the disclosure order was, inter
alia, that Gau Shan were unable to show a good arguable case on the merits
because there was no enforceable award against SA, since the Technical
Appeal Committee did not have jurisdiction to determine whether it was party
to the sale contract.
The contract specified Gau Shan as buyers and Aiglon Ltd as sellers.
Signatures were annexed under the respective headings 'Sellers - Aiglon Ltd'
and 'Buyers - Gau Shan Co Ltd'. In the top left-hand corner of the contract
appeared the words 'L'Aiglon Ltd'.
The contract contained a force majeure clause which provided that sellers
should not be responsible for non-delivery due to third parties' faults.
No delivery took place, and Gau Shan claimed for non-delivery. The defence
was that the force majeure clause applied due to the fault of third parties.
The matter came before first tier arbitrators of the Liverpool Cotton
Association.
Their award was headed as being in an arbitration between Ltd and Gau Shan,
by a contract between Ltd as sellers and Gau Shan as buyers. The award was
in Gau Shan's favour. The force majeure defence was rejected.
In their appeal submission in support of the force majeure defence, the
sellers relied on a contract between SA and a third party for the purchase
of cotton giving rise to the force majeure defence. The parties were
described in the text as Ltd and Gau Shan, though in the title Ltd's name
was preceded by L'.
The counter submission on appeal, in relation to the force majeure defence,
stated 'L'Aiglon Ltd are not a party to the contract in dispute' and
referred to Aiglon and L'Aiglon as related companies.
It was common ground that 'L'Aiglon Ltd' referred to SA, and 'Aiglon'
referred to Ltd. Up to that stage in the proceedings, Ltd had been treated
by both sides as sellers and were the only parties on their side to the
arbitration.
In paragraph 8 of their reply submissions, in the context of force majeure,
the sellers stated 'Sellers are in fact Aiglon Ltd. For the purpose of this
appeal there is no real distinction between the two companies. Any purchases
by L'Aiglon SA would be utilised for the sales by Aiglon Ltd. The two
com-panies are under the same control'.
As a result, Gau Shan put forward supplemental appeal submissions that both
companies should be made parties to the arbitration.
The solicitors for SA sought to render submissions to the appeal committee
with regard to the appellant's identity. The committee considered that the
evidence already presented set out the position.
The committee's award was issued on February 12 and was headed 'an
arbitration between Aiglon Ltd/L'Aiglon SA' and Gau Shan.
It stated 'sellers are in fact Aiglon Ltd. For the purpose of this appeal
there is no real distinction between the two companies'.
The award was against both Ltd and SA.
Mr Colman submitted that for the purposes of a Mareva injunction, the
criterion of a 'good arguable case on the merits' should be applied.
Mr Milligan submitted that was putting the test too high. He relied on
Nimenia (1983) 1WLR 1412,1417 where Lord Justice Kerr said 'a 'good arguable
case' is no doubt the minimum which the plaintiff must show in order to
cross the 'threshold' for the exercise of the jurisdiction'.
He submitted it was sufficient for the plaintiffs to establish that their
case on the merits was 'better than nothing'.
That was rejected. A good arguable case test on the merits was the correct
test, as Lord Justice Kerr made clear in referring to its being the
'minimum' the plaintiff must show.
Mr Colman submitted that by no stretch of the imagination could the appeal
committee have had jurisdiction to determine whether SA were party to the
sale contract, so that the award against SA on the footing that they were
contractually subject to the arbitration was a nullity (Buccleuch (1870) 5
Exch Cas 221).
He submitted that vitiated the whole award against SA.
Mr Milligan accepted that the principle was sound, but submitted it was
irrelevant in the present case. He contended that in considering the
application for enforcement of the award under section 26, it was for the
court to decide who were parties to the contract and therefore to the
arbitration, and that the arbitrators' decision on that topic was
irrelevant.
He said it was necessary under section 26 for the court at this juncture to
evaluate the underlying evidence, and to decide who were the sellers under
the contract.
That interpretation of section 26 was not correct.
The section gave the court power to enforce an award on an arbitration
agreement in the same manner as a judgment. The detailed procedure was
prescribed by Order 73 Rule 10.
It was common ground that the arbitrators exceeded their jurisdiction in
deciding that SA were party to the contract. That part of their award was a
nullity.
There was therefore no award to enforce so far as SA were concerned, and it
was no part of the court's function under section 26 to salvage it by
considering the issue as to who was party to the contract.
Mr Milligan could not invite the court to enforce the award against SA, when
SA only became party to it because the arbitrators chose to determine an
issue which they had no power to determine. It was not open to the court to
embark on an investigation of the merits to see if they came to the right
conclusion.
Mr Milligan's argument on this point was rejected in principle, so his
argument on the facts became academic.
His analysis of the evidence hinged essentially on paragraph 8 of the
sellers' reply.
That paragraph was directed solely to the force majeure issue and suggested
that for that purpose there was no real distinction between the two
companies. There was no suggestion in it that SA were also parties to the
contract. It followed that the court would have been against Mr Milligan on
the evidence.
There was no good arguable case on the merits in support of the section 26
application against SA, and the whole foundation of the Mareva and
disclosure orders against SA disappeared. The court proposed to set them
aside insofar as they affected SA.
For SA: Anthony Colman and Graham Dunning (Weightman Rutherfords,
Liverpool).
For Gau Shan: Iain Milligan QC and Andrew Baker (Middleton Potts).

FT  26 JUN 92 / Technology: New era looks to mind drugs - In the second
article of a series on drug research, Clive Cookson outlines treatments for
mental conditions from anxiety to memory loss
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CLIVE COOKSON
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
The pharmaceutical industry has an abysmal record in treating disorders of
the brain and nervous system. While new drugs have transformed the outlook
for people suffering from infectious illnesses, heart disease, and
gastro-intestinal problems, most psychiatric patients depend on medicines
discovered several decades ago.
Current treatments for mental conditions, from mild anxiety to severe
psychosis, emerged during the 'black box' era of drug discovery. Doctors
observed that they relieved symptoms - often poorly and unpredictably - but
pharmacologists had no idea how they worked. For the most serious problems -
degenerative brain diseases such as Alzheimer's - there is still nothing
that really works.
The outlook, however, is much brighter, as scientific discoveries about the
chemistry and biology of the brain find their way into new drugs. The ones
being introduced during the 1990s are based on an understanding of
neurotransmitters (chemical messengers which send signals between cells) and
receptors (protein molecules on the cell which receive the signals and
initiate specific biological responses). After the year 2000, there is the
prospect of far superior treatments based on the genetic processes involved
in mental disorders.
The best known neurotransmitter is 5-HT, also called 5-hyroxytryptamine or
serotonin, which is active not only in the brain but also in other parts of
the body. It is associated with several types of receptor, each giving a
different biological response. The pharmaceutical industry is developing
drugs to interact with each specific type, as an agonist to stimulate the
receptor or as an antagonist to block it. Glaxo of the UK has been
investigating 5-HT systems for almost 20 years and expects a spectacular
payback from two drugs: sumatriptan and ondansetron.
Sumatriptan (trade name Imigran) is the first effective treatment for
migraine, the intense recurrent headache suffered by at least one adult in
12. It was launched last year as an injection and is being introduced in the
UK this month in more convenient form as pills. With sumatriptan ahead of
competition, its potential sales are huge - more than Pounds 1bn a year - if
it can overcome doctors' fear of side effects.
Sumatriptan is an agonist for the 5-HT1 category of receptor, stimulating
the uptake of 5-HT in the cranial blood vessels. That reverses the swelling
which triggers a migraine attack. Glaxo had hoped sumatriptan would have no
effect elsewhere in the body but experience shows that some patients feel
tightness in the chest after injections. That is presumably because blood
vessels elsewhere in the body contain a few of the same 5-HT1 receptors.
Glaxo says sumatriptan's side effects are insignificant for healthy people
but they show how difficult it is to make a selective receptor-based drug.
Ondansetron (Zofran) is an antagonist for a different receptor type, the
5-HT3. It was launched two years ago as an anti-emetic to prevent nausea and
vomiting induced by cancer therapy, but Glaxo is now carrying out clinical
trials with ondansetron for a range of psychiatric conditions including
anxiety, schizophrenia, addiction and age-associated memory impairment.
Glaxo researchers are understandably cautious about proclaiming ondansetron
to be a psychiatric wonder-drug. They blanch when outsiders talk of it as a
potential 'smart drug' which could improve everyone's memory.
Mike Tyers, pharmacology director for Glaxo Group Research, says the 5-HT3
receptors on neurones (nerve cells in the brain) 'seem to be there to
control things when they go wrong.' When everything is working properly,
'they are fairly silent.' If so, a 5-HT3 antagonist such as ondansetron may
help to restore the balance in several disorders, without side-effects.
Another group of new drugs based on the 5-HT system is leading to improved
treatments for depression. The specific serotonin re-uptake inhibitors
(SSRIs), as they are known, increase the low 5-HT levels in the brain which
are associated with many forms of depression.
Eli Lilley of the US is already selling more than Dollars 1bn a year of its
pioneering SSRI, fluoxetine (Prozac) launched in 1988. In hot pursuit is a
second generation of SSRIs led by paroxetine (Seroxat), which was developed
jointly by Novo Nordisk of Denmark and SmithKline Beecham, the
Anglo-American group.
SSRIs have fewer side effects than the 'tricyclic' drugs which have
dominated antidepressant treatment for 30 years. Yet SSRIs still leave much
to be desired: they take at least two weeks to relieve depression and they
fail to work in about one third of patients. That may reflect partly the
poor quality of clinical diagnosis in depression and other non-acute mental
disorders.
Some scientists believe that all forms of depression ultimately work through
a common biochemical pathway. If they are right - and not everyone agrees
with the theory - it may eventually be possible to find a fast-acting drug
that will help anyone who is clinically depressed.
The greatest neurological challenge for pharmaceutical research is to find a
cure for the degenerative brain diseases which lead inexorably to dementia
and death. The most prevalent is Alzheimer's, which affects as many as 20
per cent of people over 70.
The search for an Alzheimer's treatment has led to a new class of drugs, the
nootropics, developed to enhance memory and other cognitive functions. The
first generation of nootropics aims to increase the amount of acetylcholine
in the brain. Alzheimer's patients have a marked deficit of this
neurotransmitter.
Most of the Alzheimer's drugs developed recently work indirectly by
inhibiting an enzyme called cholinesterase which breaks down acetylcholine.
They include piracetam from UCB of Belgium; oxiracetam from SmithKline
Beecham; tacrine from Warner-Lambert of the US; and physostigmine from
Forest Laboratories of the US. Although they have shown promise in clinical
trials, the manufacturers have not yet produced evidence strong enough to
convince the US Food and Administration to licence any of the drugs.
Du Pont Merck, the pharmaceutical joint venture between Du Pont and Merck of
the US, has a promising anti-dementia drug now in late clinical trials which
works in a different way. It acts directly to stimulate the release of
acetylcholine and other neurotransmitters in the brain. The drug (chemical
name linopirdine) is noteworthy too for its unusually vivid and appealing
trade name - Aviva.
However none of these memory enhancing drugs, even Aviva, can do more than
temporarily reverse or slow down the mental degeneration that is
characteristic of Alzheimer's disease. None prevents the build-up of tangled
plaques of amyloid protein, which progressively destroy patients' brains.
The best long-term hope for curing progressive dementias is to identify the
genetic mechanism responsible and then develop drugs to block its effect. In
the case of Alzheimer's, a fault in a gene coding for amyloid precursor
protein (APP) seems to be responsible. In a few families, this is inherited
but it is more often caused by environmental factors.
Many pharmaceutical researchers are now working on long-range projects to
block APP, though they are hampered by the fact that there is not yet a good
animal model for Alzheimer's. Athena Neurosciences of California is one of
the biotechnology companies furthest advanced in this area.
More futuristic still are ideas for repairing brain damage by growing new
nerve cells. That does not normally occur in an adult brain but scientists
are accumulating evidence that selective regeneration could be achieved by
removing some of the genetic factors that inhibit the process.
The series will continue next month by looking at asthma drugs.

High resolution digital cameras are now an essential tool in medical
analysis, microscopy, non-contact measurement and precision testing in
industrial research and production.
However, these cameras leave spaces between each pixel - meaning that a
computer has to estimate the image within these 'dead' areas. Now Kodak has
launched the 'Megaplus' camera which is designed to capture high resolution
1320 by 1035 pixel digital images. Uniquely, each square pixel is contiguous
with its neighbour, ensuring full image accuracy.
One hundred per cent image coverage is vital for areas like non-contact
measurement of electronic components, chemical structures or parts of the
human body too sensitive to be touched. These measurements often require
microscopic accuracy which can only be delivered by total image coverage and
capture. Kodak US 619 535 2908; UK,0442 61122.

<TEXT>
It may soon be possible to modify a person's sense of taste, or even to
restore it when it is lost or damaged as the result of illness.
The Roche Institute of Molecular Biology in Nutley, New Jersey, funded by
the Basel-based Hoffman-La Roche pharmaceuticals group, has made a
breakthrough in understanding how the sense of taste works. The research
team has discovered and cloned a protein which is only found in taste cells.
The new protein is a taste-specific (gustatory) member of a gene family
known as G-proteins which play a crucial signalling role in several types of
cells including those in the brain, eyes and heart.
Potential applications include the development of novel taste modifying
agents and medical uses. Loss of the sense of taste is common after some
illnesses and sometimes occurs as a side effect of drug or radiation
therapy. Hoffman-La Roche: Switzerland, 61 688 8888.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Management: Milking profits by churning - The west is
learning the lessons of quick-fire product launches
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By CHRISTOPHER LORENZ
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
If the pronouncements from Tokyo over the past six months were to be
believed, one would think that Japanese industry was about to drop one of
its most vicious competitive weapons: 'product churning'.
This is the practice of launching a bewildering flood of new and face-lifted
products at ever shorter intervals. Its advantages are that distribution
channels are kept full; consumers are constantly beguiled with novelties;
and - most important - the churner's competitors barely get a look-in.
The practice has been followed for at least a decade, with growing success
in markets around the world, by Japanese manufacturers of cars, consumer
electronics, computers, semiconductors, air-conditioners, and other
products.
At the most recent count, model changes in video cassette recorders and
air-conditioners have been coming through once every six months, and as
often as every three months in word-processors and cordless phones. The
result is a proliferation of very similar products and a rapid rate of
replacement.
The practice of churning has required not so much high expenditure on new
product development as the ability to design and develop new items at
remarkable speed.
Hence the rush by western companies to try to learn from Japan how to
shorten their new product development cycles by improving the productivity
of their design and engineering processes. This can be achieved partly by
getting groups of different technical specialists to work more effectively
together in integrated project teams.
A few leading western companies have gone a long way towards closing the
gap, notably Hewlett-Packard, Texas Instruments, Procter &amp; Gamble and Xerox
in the US, plus Philips and Rover cars in Europe.
On product lines such as laser printers, HP is at least as fast as its
Japanese rivals. It is also as good at the classic Japanese strategy of
launching a string of 'new' products which are only slight variants of the
ones they replace or augment. Yet, at a time when most western companies are
still only starting to shorten their product development cycles, and to
speed up the rate of new product introduction, the Japanese are hinting that
they have overdone 'product churning', and will now rein it back.
Starting in January with Akio Morita, chairman of Sony and Japan's
unofficial trade ambassador, and quickly followed in February by the
Ministry of International Trade and Industry (Miti), there has been a series
of statements from Tokyo that this must be done for two purposes.
First, for corporate financial and marketing reasons: to cut development and
investment costs and thereby boost hard-pressed corporate profitability and
dividends; and to avoid aggravating incipient consumer resistance to purely
cosmetic product changes.
Second, for national socio-economic and international environmental reasons:
to reduce the over-use of 'resources'. By this is meant not only steel and
aluminium but also human beings: the Japanese government is under pressure
to reduce the average working week and no one works longer than a Japanese
development engineer.
Morita's ruminations were intriguing in their combination of micro with
macro arguments. Calling upon industry to behave more responsibly towards
all its 'stakeholders' - not just shareholders, but also employees,
customers, society and the environment - he said companies must give less
overwhelming priority than in the past 'to victory in the market-place'.
Various aspects of the Morita and Miti clarion calls have been echoed widely
by company bosses. A vice-president of Matsushita, the consumer electronics
giant, was quoted in a Japanese newspaper as declaring that 'the task for
manufacturers in the future is to make products that have added value and a
long life'.
In the motor industry, both Nissan and Toyota have expressed their intention
of stretching from four to five years the interval at which they make
significant changes in their mass-market models. To the western eye and ear,
all this seems like manna from heaven. But is it to be taken at face value?
And can western manufacturers now ease up on their panic-stricken rush to
learn how to 'churn' products themselves?
Common sense suggests that the answers to the two questions are negative.
Japanese companies (like German ones) have a habit of magnifying their
problems for foreign consumption, and waxing lyrical about the good of
mankind.
The most authoritative western source of expertise on product churning is
the consultant credited with inventing the term, Kevin Jones of McKinsey &amp;
Company, who has lived in Japan for a decade. Jones confirms the
common-sense view. 'Product churning won't stop - it has become part of the
corporate woodwork and is now a necessary competitive tool,' he says. 'On
the other hand, it probably will not accelerate any further.'
Will it slow down, even temporarily, as companies struggle to rebuild their
profits? Will Nissan and Toyota, especially, turn their words into action?
'I hear their comments, but I'm not sure it's going to happen,' Jones
comments. As he says, the car-makers face quite a dilemma. If they do
stretch their new model launch cycle from four to five years, a sort of
peace pact could prevail for a while. But he points out that there would be
a constant temptation for one company to break ranks. 'So things will
probably stay as they are.'
Rather than dropping product churning, Jones forecasts that manufacturers
will keep it at its current level, and add three further weapons to it:
Still greater productivity in research, design and development.
The injection of more really new content and added value into their 'new'
products.
A smattering of western project evaluation techniques, at least at
relatively elevated levels in the corporate hierarchy. The absence of this
in most Japanese companies has been one of the main factors behind their
speed of product churning, explains Jones.
Except at a few companies, the middle managers involved in regular product
development and launch decisions tend not to possess the financial skills
necessary to calculate returns on investment in individual new products, or
even in entire product lines, he reports.
Development and launch decisions are based on simpler principles, such as
market leadership, beating the competition and supporting distribution
channels.
Because of this, Jones forecasts that it may take a decade for western
financial analysis techniques to permeate product development.
In other words, top Japanese managers like Sony's Morita may declare their
intent to convert to a more western style of decision-making, but many
decisions below them may continue to be made in much the same way as before.
For the time being, the wind of change apparently blowing in Tokyo is,
therefore, not at all warm for the majority of western companies. Only the
foremost leaders can feel at all confident. So the real message from Tokyo
is decidedly double-edged. Far from being reassured, most western managers
should be really churned-up about it.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Management: Why spreading the load is all in a year's work -
A look at moves towards annualised working hours systems which cut overtime
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID GOODHART
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
Companies which employ the 2m people who currently work more than 48 hours a
week in Britain have just been saved the heavy cost of reorganising their
businesses. At British insistence, employment ministers of the European
Community have reached a deal on the controversial working time directive
which means in practice that nothing need change in Britain for at least 10
years.
Even though British employers are off the hook for now, the directive may,
nevertheless, concentrate their minds on the issue of working time, and
pressure is bound to increase to cut excessive hours.
British workers work longer and less productive hours than many of their
competitors, with overtime running at more than 10 per cent of hours worked,
compared with 3 per cent in Germany and virtually none in Japan.
The vested interests defending high overtime working are strong and the
Brussels directive may provide the jolt needed to push Britain towards a
better organisation of working time.
That argument is strongly pressed by Philip Lynch Associates, a consultant
that is helping a growing number of companies introduce annualised hours
systems.
This entails calculating working time on an annual rather than a weekly or
monthly basis with employees contracted to work, for example, 1,764 hours
per year rather than 38 per week. The system gives employers flexibility in
the scheduling of work, allowing for longer standard hours at some periods
and shorter hours at others.
That avoids a pattern of underwork followed by massive amounts of overtime.
Overtime is not usually ruled out in annualised hours systems but it becomes
rare and without institutionalised overtime, workers have nothing to gain
from spinning out work in normal time.
'If the working time directive forces a re-think on deeply entrenched
practices, it can only do good. Annualised hours is one of the spring-boards
to bring us up to international best practice,' says Peter Curran, a senior
partner at Philip Lynch.
Annualised hours can allow for large variations in the working week but
still remain within the 48 hour weekly limit desired by most EC countries
and the trade unions.
The system has become increasingly popular in British industry and according
to a recent Department of Employment survey now covers about 6 per cent of
UK employees. Initially most interest was expressed by continuous process
manufacturers in paper and board, glass, cement and chemicals.
The paper and board industry already has a national framework agreement for
annualised hours, while Pilkington and Blue Circle are among manufacturers
to have introduced it. Industries with highly seasonal work flows, like food
and drink or leisure, have also taken a strong interest, as has the
distribution sector.
Drawbacks with annualised hours include the loss of overtime for lower paid
workers who may have been dependent on it and the difficulty of responding
to unexpected fluctuations in demand. The latter can be dealt with through
good contingency planning and some flexibility in the rostering of hours.
Philip Lynch says that thanks to the productivity benefits of annualised
hours, most people work substantially fewer hours for similar pay. It claims
that introducing annualised hours can leads to a general shake-up of working
practices.
At Express Foods, one of the UK's largest cheese producers, the company
pulled down weekly hours from a peak of more than 70 to an average of 39.
According to Curran, volumes rose and labour hours per tonne fell by 36 per
cent, while employee's earnings rose 9 per cent and holidays were
lengthened.
Express Foods say that annualised hours added Pounds 500,000 to its profits
in the first year. 'If I were to stop it now I would have a riot on my
hands,' says Geoff Hulland, general manager.
The biggest hurdle with annualised hours, according to Philip Lynch, is
management's apprehension at such change. 'Ironically', says Curran, 'the
issues which most daunt, like the prospect of no-overtime, rarely emerge
after the switch'.

<TEXT>
A EUROPEAN Constitutional convention was proposed yesterday by the Liberal
Democrats, Ralph Atkins writes.
Although Liberal Democrats are committed to supporting Maastricht, they
believe the treaty fails to overcome the EC's 'democratic deficit'.
The convention, which the party proposed should be set up in 1995, would
include representatives of the European parliament, national parliaments,
regional governments and the European commission.

</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RALPH ATKINS
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SIR PATRICK Mayhew, Northern Ireland secretary, betrayed a growing tension
yesterday between the UK and Irish Republic over the 'round table' talks on
the province's future.
He expressed 'disappointment' at the delaying of a meeting expected this
week between the two governments.
But Sir Patrick told MPs that the time was not yet right for separate
negotiations planned between London and Dublin and Northern Ireland's
Unionist and nationalist politicians - a series of meetings that Mr David
Andrews, the Irish foreign minister, argues should have begun already. The
two ministers have not spoken since Monday.
The atmosphere of distrust may persuade Sir Patrick that early suspension of
the talks process may offer the best way of ensuring it can be resumed
later. The end of July has been set as the cut-off point.
Unionists are putting an increasing emphasis on the meeting between the two
governments - the 'third strand' of the talks process - where they hope
Dublin's constitutional claim on Northern Ireland will be discussed.
The nationalist Social Democratic and Labour party fears that Sir Patrick is
making too many concessions to the Unionists and reneging on his commitment
to start talks on relations between north and south Ireland within weeks of
the talks process beginning.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Parliament and Politics: Maastricht bill set for rough ride
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ALISON SMITH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
SENIOR Labour frontbenchers are preparing to add to the government's
difficulties when the Maastricht bill returns to the Commons in the autumn,
by voting against any attempt to curtail debate.
Tory Euro-sceptics are promising to put down at least as many amendments
when the bill returns as were tabled when the bill was last due to be
debated. 'The scope is limitless,' one leading Euro-sceptic said yesterday.
A decision by Labour to oppose any move by the government to timetable
debate on the whole bill or to limit discussion on any individual group of
amendments, may jeopardise the prospect of completing the legislation at
all.
At worst, the choice for the government might be between losing the bill
simply because of the time taken for debate, and losing it after trying and
failing to guillotine it.
Some opposition spokesmen are conscious that any move to stymie the bill
would have widespread and negative repercussions on the party's position
with its European counterparts - particularly if the move proved effective.
The balance of opinion, however, is that securing the bill is a problem for
the government and Labour should not allow them an easy time.
Basing the most determined opposition on the handling of the bill rather
than on its substance also offers Labour the best way of causing
difficulties without compromising its broadly pro-European stance.
Already more than 120 amendments have been put down, together with more than
30 new clauses. It will be for Miss Betty Boothroyd, the Speaker, to choose
which should be debated when the bill comes back.
The amendment most likely to see common interest between Tory rebels and
Labour MPs is one proposing a referendum on Maastricht.
Mr John Smith, the clear favourite to be Labour leader, has publicly said he
opposes the idea, but some elements in the party believe that support for
such a move offers the best chance of keeping Labour united over the bill.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Lloyd's underwriters rein back spending
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD LAPPER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
THERE WERE two signs yesterday of retrenchment among professionals at the
Lloyd's insurance market, where record losses of Pounds 2.06bn were
announced on Wednesday.
In a radical move AJ Archer Holdings, one of the largest agency groups which
manages 10 of the market's 278 syndicates, announced a 10 per cent
across-the-board salary cut for underwriters.
Separately, Steel Burrill Jones, the insurance broker, confirmed that two of
its directors had sold shares partly in order to pay insurance losses at
Lloyd's.
At Archer, Mr Chris Burton, joint managing director, said the pay cut was 'a
positive step on behalf of Names'. He added: 'Underwriters should share with
the fortunes of syndicates.'
Archer underwriters are paid an average of more than Pounds 100,000 a year,
with substantial extra benefits in the form of pension contributions.
The move by Archer followed similar but less severe action on pay by other
large agencies. Octavian Group introduced a 10 per cent pay cut for senior
underwriters in April and other agencies have frozen salaries.
Figures released last year showed that more than a third of Lloyd's
underwriters received in excess of Pounds 100,000 in 1987, the last year for
which Lloyd's as a whole has reported profits.
Mr Paul Archard, chairman of Lloyd's Underwriting Agents Association, said
wages accounted for between 25 per cent and 30 per cent of syndicate costs.
He added that agencies were now tending to reduce basic salaries and
increase the amount offered in profit commission.
At Steel Burrill Jones, Mr Tony Keys, finance director, and Mr George Boden,
chief executive, have sold 100,000 SBJ shares - worth about Pounds 300,000.
Both men are members of loss-making syndicates that are involved in 'spiral'
reinsurance business - reinsuring the high-level catastrophe exposures of
syndicates and London companies.
Mr Keys, who resigned from Lloyd's at the end of 1990, had a Pounds 15,000
share in Gooda Walker syndicate 290, which has left him with losses of more
than Pounds 45,000. 'I'm that rare phenomenon - an insider Name on Gooda
Walker,' said Mr Keys, who is also a member of Pulbrook syndicate 90, which
reported heavy losses in its 1982 year.
Mr Boden has a slightly bigger stake on one of the Feltrim spiral
syndicates, which also suffered losses in 1989.
Meanwhile, Lloyd's yesterday announced that its extraordinary general
meeting requested by Names on Monday will be held on Monday July 27 at its
City headquarters. Mr David Coleridge, Lloyd's chairman, is scheduled to
appear before a joint meeting of the Tory backbench finance and industry
committees on July 14.

</HEADLINE>
<TEXT>
MR Malcolm Edwards, who resigned as British Coal's commercial director this
year, is among former managers lobbying for a separate coal corporation in
Scotland after the industry's privatisation.
The Royal Bank of Scotland yesterday confirmed that Lord Younger, its
chairman, had met a group of former British Coal managers and
representatives of mining unions for 'exploratory discussions' on financing
the proposed corporation.
Mr Edwards resigned as commercial director after disagreements with Mr Neil
Clarke, corporation chairman.
The group has been lobbying ministers and other senior Conservatives for
support for a management-employee buyout to control all deep-mine and
opencast reserves in Scot-land.
The Royal Bank said yesterday: 'We are still at the stage of having
exploratory discussions.'
Chairman-designate of the proposed corporation is Mr George McAlpine, former
British Coal Scottish area director and group manager.
He said the group expected the 'environmentally friendly low-sulphur
Scottish coal' to yield annual profits of about Pounds 60m. That would
include Pounds 20m from the Longannet deep mine complex and Pounds 40m from
opencast operations, the most profitable in the UK.
The Scottish Trades Union Congress is also involved and has made a formal
submission to the government on the issue.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Refund on way for bank error
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By DAVID BARCHARD
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A LETTER from the bank manager early next month will bring good news for
several thousand Lloyds Bank customers.
The bank has discovered that it overcharged some of its current-account
customers for overdrafts for up to five years, and 35,000 of its staff are
combing records to identify them and arrange a refund.
Lloyds said yesterday: 'The process will be completed by July 3 and in the
week after that each branch manager will send out a mildly embarrassed
letter to those customers affected. We think it will be only a tiny
proportion of our 4.5m current accounts.'
The bank said it did not believe it owed large sums to most of the customers
concerned because they were personal-account holders. It admitted that some
small business customers might have lost much larger amounts.
The mistake was simple. Some customers with agreed overdrafts were charged
as if they were unauthorised. Instead of paying between 16 per cent and 23.8
per cent, they were charged a punitive 34.4 per cent in interest.
Although a higher rate was being paid, the accounts were correctly labelled
as agreed overdrafts, so the customers did not pay transaction charges that
go with unauthorised overdrafts. As a result, many failed to spot that they
were being overcharged.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Consortium in bid to keep RiverBus going
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By RICHARD TOMKINS, Transport Correspondent
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
A CONSORTIUM of public and private interests is on the brink of launching a
bid to rescue RiverBus, London's heavily loss-making Thames passenger
service, from closure.
The RiverBus is due to close on Tuesday after the recent financial collapse
of Olympia &amp; York's Canary Wharf property development, which had subsidised
it.
The administrators of Canary Wharf have refused to underwrite RiverBus's
losses beyond the end of this month. That means the company is due to become
insolvent and close at midnight on Tuesday.
Now, a consortium of interests in London's Docklands is close to agreeing on
proposals to inject Pounds 300,000 into the company to keep it going for
three months while attempts are made to save it.
The consortium is led by the London Docklands Development Corporation, the
state-owned body charged with the regeneration of Docklands. Members include
the Canary Wharf administrators, P&amp;O, several large Docklands businesses,
and local authorities in the Docklands area.
The consortium wants the RiverBus to survive because it is an important
transport link between central London and Docklands. A scheduled service
runs every 20 minutes between Chelsea Harbour in the west and Greenwich in
the east, stopping at six points in central London and at Canary Wharf.
P&amp;O's interest in the rescue stems from its position as a shareholder in
RiverBus. The company also has a large property development at Chelsea
Harbour and is the biggest single construction contractor at Canary Wharf.
RiverBus has consistently lost money since it was founded because passenger
numbers have failed to rise to the point where it has been able to cover its
costs. Losses are currently estimated at Pounds 2m a year. Passenger numbers
are rising, though, and the company believes it has a profitable future if
it can make better use of its assets by joining with a suitable partner.
The consortium believes a three-month breathing space will give RiverBus at
least two possible options for survival. One is that Canary Wharf will find
a purchaser ready to restore the service's subsidy; the other that a
purchaser for RiverBus will be found.
RiverBus is believed to be in talks with four interested parties, but none
is at a sufficiently advanced stage of negotiations that it is ready or
willing to make an offer.

US car makers have suffered a setback in their efforts to win the imposition
of dumping duties on imports of Japanese minivans.
Although the Commerce Department ruled last month that Toyota, Mazda and
other Japanese manufacturers had sold their minivans in the US below
production cost, the International Trade Commission (ITC) decided this week
that US manufacturers had not been harmed by the imports.
Commissioners noted that minivans were one segment of the motor vehicle
market where domestic manufacturers still dominate, with an estimated 88 per
cent market share.
They said that Chrysler was selling as many vans as it could make, while any
problems Ford and General Motors had in selling their vans could be
attributed to the slow US economy and to their own product and price
shortcomings. The ruling infuriated the US motor industry, which had been
counting on the US unfair trade laws to help them hold back Japanese
competition.

MIDLAND Bank of the UK is considering buying a loss-making state-owned bank
in Peru, writes Sally Bowen in Lima.
The bank's senior Latin American executive, Mr Marcos Brujis, arrived in
Lima this week for negotiations with government officials over the purchase
of Banco Popular.
This, one of the oldest and most extensive of Peru's banking networks, has
deep financial troubles. Its bad-loans portfolio is about the equivalent of
Dollars 55m and securitised debts to foreign banks Dollars 76m.
Midland would commit itself to bring in credit lines for Dollars 10m-Dollars
14m, and to guarantee another Dollars 10m or so in credit from a
multilateral financial institution such as the Andean Development
Corporation.
The purchase would be made largely through an exchange of short-term debt
for equity in the bank. Midland still holds some Dollars 24m in Peruvian
short-term debt.
Midland is expected to insist that the Peruvian government assume Banco
Popular's bad-loans portfolio.

FT  26 JUN 92 / World Trade News: Action urged on east European steel
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By ANDREW BAXTER
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
WESTERN governments should act to stimulate domestic demand for steel in
eastern Europe, relieving the pressure on local steelmakers to export at low
prices, according to a report by Meps (Europe), the steel consultancy.
East European governments, meanwhile, should press on quickly with
rationalisation, paving the way for generous privatisation terms to
encourage foreign investment in steel. The recommendations are made in East
European Steel, a 540-page report which analyses the problems of the steel
industries in Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the former Yugoslavia and
the former Soviet Union.
The collapse of the former Soviet Union and political upheaval in eastern
Europe have seriously damaged these countries' traditional markets. East
European producers have tried to switch to exporting to western Europe,
provoking complaints from some western steelmakers about dumping.
The Meps report stresses that inward investment by the west, encouraged by
western governments, is essential to stimulate domestic demand for steel in
eastern Europe, thus defusing the row over imports to the west.
However, it warns of a potential obstacle to privatisation projects caused
by the imports issue. Many east European privatisations in consumer goods
have successfully used low labour costs to produce finished products for
domestic consumption and more importantly, export to western markets, it
says. But the strategy would not be readily acceptable in the steel sector -
due to the limited growth potential for steel and the hostility to increased
imports into western Europe.
The report says several joint venture partnerships are being negotiated but
are taking a long time to complete. East European governments, says Meps,
need to be more flexible in valuing assets and need to actively promote
joint venture partnerships. Western governments should give assistance to
companies to form joint ventures through some limited form of tax
concession. Meps says east European governments must accept that future
crude steel production will be only 65 per cent of the peak years in the
late 1980s.
East European Steel, Meps (Europe), 263 Glossop Road, Sheffield, S10 2GZ,

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
US OFFICIALS are urging Latin American and Caribbean finance ministers to
spread the results of their new-found economic success more broadly among
their populations.
At a meeting in Washington yesterday of ministers from selected countries in
Latin America and the Caribbean, the US called for a continuation of the
economic reforms that have taken root in many countries over the past three
or four years and helped to curb the runaway debt problems that hamstrung
them in the 1980s.
'What now has to take place is not only a continuation of those reforms, but
they have to become more broadly shared,' a senior US Treasury official
said.
'Obviously, in order to keep the people of Latin America convinced that this
is something good for them, the economic fruits of these reforms can't all
be in the stock market; they have to flow down to the people,' he added.
The US warning follows an attempted military coup in Venezuela in February,
which was partly attributable to discontent over the harsh impact of the
country's economic reform programme, backed by the International Monetary
Fund.
This had made life harder for many of the poor and the middle class by
cutting government subsidies.
'There is an increasing recognition in Latin America that the consolidation
of economic reforms requires good governance and a social agenda,' commented
Mr Richard Feinberg, president of Inter-American Dialogue, a
Washington-based policy centre.
He noted it was easier to stress democratic values as an important component
of economic reform now that the Cold War was over and the US was no longer
supporting so many dictators in Latin America.

</HEADLINE>

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE US Commerce Department yesterday revised up its estimate of economic
growth in the first quarter to an annual rate of 2.7 per cent, the best
performance since President George Bush took office early in 1989.
However, the revision failed to lift the spirits of many forecasters who are
worried by more recent evidence that growth is again flagging.
Mr Michael Boskin, the chief White House economist, yesterday warned that
the risk of 'sluggish growth' was greater than that of a resurgence of
inflation. He also expressed concern about the slow growth of the money
supply.
His remarks added to the pressure on the Federal Reserve to ease monetary
policy, following Mr Bush's direct call this week for lower interest rates.
Separate reports yesterday of a sharp rise in claims for unemployment
insurance and a decline in sales of previously-owned homes gave further
evidence of sluggish conditions.
Unemployment claims rose by 16,000 to 422,000 in the week ending June 13.
Sales of existing homes fell 1.7 per cent in May to register their second
consecutive monthly decline.
The third and final estimate of growth in the first quarter contrasted
favourably with previous estimates of 2 per cent and 2.4 per cent. The
improvement reflected upward revisions to investment and net exports.
This was the fourth consecutive quarter of sluggish growth after a faltering
economic recovery in the spring of last year. GDP expanded at an annual rate
of 0.4 per cent in the final quarter of last year.
Many analysts fear that the 2.7 per annual growth rate recorded in the first
quarter will not be sustained in the current quarter, mainly because of a
deceleration in consumer spending.

FT  26 JUN 92 / An urge to privatise: Sally Bowen assesses the Peruvian
economy
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By SALLY BOWEN
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
AS the Peruvian economy sinks further into fiscal deficit and balance of
payments crisis, the political will to privatise seems at last to have
hardened. The government has given its blessing to debt-equity swaps in what
now promises to be a speedy programme of state sell-offs.
'With debt paper, we increase demand and speed up the whole process,' says
Mr Carlos Montoya, a privatisation specialist with Latin American experience
and executive director of Copri, the government's streamlined commission for
promotion of private investment.
Copri's pledge to complete an average of one sell-off a week means,
according to Mr Montoya, that by August or September 1994 the state will no
longer own any of the businesses which Copri chief Jaime Yoshiyama claims
costs the state Dollars 10m a day.
Some 55 public sector companies already have committees working on technical
assessment, legal intricacies and identification of the most desirable
privatisation mechanism, with World Bank technical assistance and funding.
Copri's wide powers, combined with the absence within today's Peru of any
formal political opposition, indicate the path ahead will be unobstructed.
The debt-equity swap mechanism is intended to attract purchasers for
difficult-to-sell companies rather than to dent Peru's overall debt
position. Total foreign debt, according to government figures, amounts to
Dollars 22.6bn - public sector debt is almost 93 per cent of the total and
some two thirds represent arrears accumulated since Peru declared a debt
moratorium in the mid-1980s.
First to be used in the privatisation drive is Peru's short-term working
capital and trade-related debt paper. This amounts to some Dollars 813.5m
and currently trades at between 20 and 63 per cent of face value, depending
on whether interest is being paid. Discounts mean this debt will be quickly
eaten up in the purchase of a handful of big companies.
Once short-term debt is cleared, the government hopes to move on to
medium-term debt. This is syndicated and requires the negotiation of waivers
from lending banks before it can be freed for use. Citibank, leader of the
private banks' steering committee, says one obstacle to this - objections
from a New York bank - are almost cleared.
Principal holders of Peruvian short-term debt paper include Chase Manhattan,
Manufacturers Hanover, Union Bank of Switzerland, Bank of Tokyo, Citibank,
Credit Lyonnais and Midland Bank. The last three are all reported as
expressing interest in swapping some of their paper to buy into Peru's
state-owned banking system, specifically into Banco Popular, which is near
collapse and which Midland is examining closely (see above story), and into
the healthier networks of Continental and Interbanc.
Further interest in debt swaps is expected from Peru's supplier creditors
who are owed Dollars 1.4bn. The Japanese have been important creditors since
the construction of the northern Peruvian oil pipeline and are reported to
be behind some of the bigger current purchases of Peruvian paper on the New
York secondary market. They, the German company Ferrostal, supplier of
submarines to the Peruvian navy in the 1970s and Yugoslavian Energoprojekt
account for the lion's share of supplier debt.
Citibank, itself the holder of some Dollars 100m in Peruvian debt paper and,
through Citicorp in New York one of the recently active dealers in debt
paper, is 'very eager to get involved in privatisation', according to Lima
branch manager Rafael Venegas. He intends to bring together holders of debt
paper into consortia under a specialist 'operator', as the bank has done in
other countries.
'It's a bit trickier in Peru because of the country risk element,' Mr
Venegas admits. Japanese creditors are likely to seek only a small
percentage in some of Peru's giant state mining companies.
Mr Montoya expects that Peruvian privatisation bargains will be snapped up
primarily by Latin Americans. 'What we've mostly got is state companies
worth between, say, Dollars 20m and Dollars 50m - not big enough to interest
the major transnationals,' he says. 'But they'll be attractive to
neighbouring countries who are looking to expand and build up networks.'
Much remains to be done in selling the privatisation philosophy to unions
and workers in Peru, but the government hopes its plans to hand over 10 per
cent of state shareholdings directly to workers, on completion of
privatisations, will defuse opposition.
'The best guarantee of the non-reversibility of the process is to turn
workers into popular capitalists,' says Mr Montoya.

<TEXT>
MISSION ENERGY of the US is to head a consortium to build the 2,400 MW
Paiton power project in East Java. The decision by the Indonesian government
is a rebuff to Intercontinental Electric Inc (IEI) of the US which has been
negotiating for at least part of the Dollars 3.6bn (Pounds 1.9bn) project.
Paiton would be the first instance in Indonesia of a private
build-own-and-operate scheme linked directly into the national grid. The
project's output would be purchased by PLN, the state utility, at an agreed
rate.
Such schemes are regarded by the World Bank as the way forward for Indonesia
which requires investment of about Dollars 20bn in electric power between
1994 and 1998, a third of which is expected to come from private sector. The
government had planned to split the Paiton project into two separate
contracts, each for two 600 MW units worth about Dollars 1.8bn, and had been
talking with consortia led by Mission Energy and IEI since last year.
In a recent confidential meeting with both companies, the government said it
would accept just one consortium and 'expressed a clear preference for
Mission Energy', a government official has said.
The Mission Energy consortium had a better technical proposal, and showed
greater capability to raise equity finance and loans necessary for the
project's completion, the official noted.
The project will still be built in two stages, the first to be completed by
1997, but the consortium will have a first option on construction of the
second stage.
At the meeting, the government suggested some members of the IEI consortium
should be taken on board by Mission Energy. The IEI consortium includes the
Bimantara Group - led by President Suharto's second son - Westinghouse and
Mitsubishi Heavy Industries.
Industry officials say Bimantara is negotiating with Batu Hitam Perkasa, an
Indonesian coal-mining company and local partner of the Mission Energy
consortium, for an equity stake of up to 10 per cent in the project.
Other members of the Mission Energy consortium include General Electric of
the US and Mitsui of Japan. Negotiations between the government and the new
consortium are expected to begin in August with the contract finalised early
next year.

brand-name drugs
</HEADLINE>

<TEXT>
CANADA has abandoned a controversial policy, adopted more than two decades
ago, of forcing brand-name pharmaceutical companies to license their
products to generic drug makers.
The federal government has tabled a bill lengthening patent protection for
medicines from 17 to 20 years, and giving them the same protection as all
other products. Prior to 1987, when the rules were first tightened, generic
companies could apply for manufacturing rights within two or three years of
a drug coming on the market in exchange for a modest royalty fee. Generic
medicines are usually priced 15-20 per cent below brand-name competitors,
and the government estimates that the new legislation will add CDollars 75m
(Pounds 33.7m) to Dollars 125m to the total cost of drug purchases over the
next five years.
The two dozen or so Canadian generic producers have been a thorn in the side
of the international pharmaceutical industry for many years. Besides
undercutting prices in the domestic market, they have been active exporters
of cheap medicines.

   WASHINGTON
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE VERBAL war between Mr Ross Perot, the independent aiming to win the US
presidency, and the Republican Party has continued unabated, with Governor
Bill Clinton, the presumptive Democratic candidate, pointedly distancing
himself from the fray.
Mr Rich Bond, chairman of the party, phoned the Larry King Live television
show and challenged Mr Perot to produce on air one shred of evidence of
Republican dirty tricks. Mr Perot hit back: 'I can spend until midnight, but
I'm not going to do what you want on your terms.'
Earlier on the show, Mr Perot produced a letter of January 1990, from
President George Bush, thanking the Texan billionaire for having offered to
winkle General Manuel Noriega out of his refuge in the Papal Nunciature in
Panama. The warmth of Mr Bush's words, he said, showed there was no personal
animus between the two and that suggestions to the contrary were also part
of the scheme to 'redefine my personality.'
Mr Perot had implied on Wednesday that the media accepted feeds from 'the
Republican dirty tricks committee.' Several newspapers vigorously denied
this yesterday, pointing out that Mr Perot had produced nothing to confirm
his allegations.
The Texan clearly feels himself the victim of a conspiracy by the Washington
political and media establishment. In all his public appearances over the
last 24 hours, he has claimed that only he is in touch with the American
people, who can see through the attempt to lay him low.
Mr Clinton, sensing an opportunity in the Bush-Perot open warfare, said
yesterday: 'There's a billionaire, a millionaire and me - and most of the
American people are more like me.'

<TEXT>
GUANGDONG, the fastest growing province in China, plans to expand at a real
rate of nearly 13 per cent a year for the next 20 years in its drive to
catch up with Asia's other high-growth economies, Zhu Senlin, its governor,
said.
Zhu's prediction, which was made in Beijing on Wednesday, follows a
reassessment of the province's growth potential occasioned by the visit at
the beginning of the year of Deng Xiaoping, China's 87-year-old leader.
Deng encouraged provincial authorities to be more bold and strive to reach
the level of development of Asia's four 'dragons' - Hong Kong, South Korea,
Taiwan and Singapore. Soon afterwards officials began to redraw plans for
economic development.
This year Guangdong's economic performance has been impressive. In the first
five months of this year industrial production has risen by 26 per cent
compared with the same period last year.
Trade is also growing strongly. In the first three months of this year the
value of exports was 35.3 per cent higher than in the January-March period
last year. The province produced a trade surplus of Dollars 1.67bn in the
period - 13.4 per cent higher than in the first quarter of 1991.
But there are also signs the economy might be over-heating. Retail sales in
the first five months were 17.7 per cent higher than for the same period
last year. Property prices are rising strongly. Within the past year they
have increased more than 30 per cent.
Economists in Hong Kong said Zhu's prediction for the overall growth rate
was reminiscent of the language of the central planner.
But Mr Enzio von Pfiel, economist at Smith New Court, a British brokerage,
said: 'I could well see Guangdong growing annually in the range of 10 per
cent to 13 per cent over the coming years.'
Between 1984 and 1991, Guangdong posted an annual growth in GDP of 13.9 per
cent. Industrial production grew at an annual rate of 23.8 per cent.

FT  26 JUN 92 / OECD Economic Outlook: Scant sign of real recovery in UK
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By PETER MARSH
</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
'FEW signs of a sustained pick-up' are evident in Britain, the OECD warned
yesterday.
It said Britain's economy would grow much more slowly this year than
envisaged six months ago and at less than a third of the rate projected for
other Group of Seven industrial nations. The expected recovery later this
year would be constrained by high unemployment, the weak housing market and
large debts.
The bleak message underlined how - even though Britain is not alone in the
G7 in experiencing economic slowdown - its difficulties are particularly
acute. It came two weeks before the G7 (the US, Japan, Germany, France,
Britain, Italy, and Canada) meets in Munich to discuss the world economy.
The OECD's estimate that UK output will expand this year by 0.4 per cent
contrasts with its 2.2 per cent projection last December.
It is also substantially lower than forecasts for the other G7 members. Of
these, the next most laggardly in 1992 is expected to be Germany, which,
according to OECD predictions covering only the western part of the country,
will see growth of 1.3 per cent. The OECD puts overall G7 growth this year
at 1.8 per cent.
The UK Treasury said the OECD's estimate was 'not endorsed' by Britain. But
in an internal exercise, the Treasury is almost certainly revising downwards
its last published forecast of 1 per cent, made in the March budget.
The OECD thinks a hesitant UK recovery is probably starting about now, after
the recession touched bottom in the first quarter. But an increase in
business investment, which has fallen sharply during the longest economic
decline since the 1940s, is unlikely before late in the year.
Company profitability (as measured by the rate of return on capital) is
likely to be 9.9 per cent this year against 15.3 per cent for the whole of
the G7. Next year, the figures are expected to be 10.8 per cent and 15.7 per
cent respectively.
As for 1993, the OECD thinks UK output will expand by 2.6 per cent, compared
with 3.1 per cent for the G7.
But amid the gloom, the OECD sees some hopeful signs:
Private-sector wage settlements have dropped rapidly, enhancing
international competitiveness. Given projected good growth in world trade,
that should give UK exports 'an element of strength'.
Underlying inflation as measured by growth in the statistical deflators for
personal consumption could be as low as 3 per cent in 1993, 'creating the
conditions for a recovery in business investment'.
Removal of political uncertainty after the April general election has
'significantly increased' the probability of economic recovery by boosting
business and consumer confidence.
Higher public spending, at least partly caused by the recession, should
boost economic activity generally.
Over the longer term, the report says a critical issue is whether government
policies in areas such as training 'have boosted UK competitiveness
sufficiently to realise a better medium-term growth, employment and
inflation performance'.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Turks to debate air cover for Kurds
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>
   By JOHN MURRAY BROWN
</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>
   ANKARA
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
THE Turkish parliament is today to debate whether to renew the allied air
umbrella which has been vital for the security of the Iraqi Kurds.
The count is expected to be close, despite calls to extend air cover from Mr
Suleyman Demirel, the coalition prime minister, and a recommendation from
the National Security Council on Tuesday. Under the present agreement, US,
French and British fighter aircraft based at a Turkish-US base 310 miles
from the Iraqi border police the skies over northern Iraq to protect Kurds
from Iraqi military attack.
Together with the Kurdish Pesh Mergas guerrillas, the allied air threat has
been the main deterrent to President Saddam Hussein since western forces
left northern Iraq last July. Their departure followed a relief operation to
establish safe havens for the Kurds after the Gulf war.
The allied presence is credited with preventing a repeat of last year's
refugee exodus, which is still Ankara's main concern and persuaded Turkey to
back allied moves to set up the 'safe haven'.
Turkish nationalists on both the conservative and left wings remain opposed
to the presence of any foreign troops on Turkish soil. The Social Democratic
Populists (SHP), now the junior coalition partners, spoke against theaccord
when it was introduced during the former Motherland party government. 'We
didn't ask them to come here,' said Mr Erdal Inonu, the deputy prime
minister and SHP leader. 'Nevertheless we will be responsible for the
consequences.'
When the protocol was rolled over last December, Mr Demirel said it would be
for the last time. The prime minister also promised any decision would
depend on parliament's sanction, whereas previously the government used
special powers granted during the Gulf crisis.

FT  26 JUN 92 / Anglo signs break through labour code
</HEADLINE>
<BYLINE>

<DATELINE>
   JOHANNESBURG
</DATELINE>
<TEXT>
ANGLO AMERICAN Corporation, South Africa's largest company, has signed a
ground-breaking labour relations agreement with the National Union of
Mineworkers (NUM).
The code of conduct accord is one of the most significant developments in
South African labour relations since the legalisation of black trade unions
in 1979. The code, the first of its kind in the industry, is aimed at
eliminating violence in the mines and the violation of a wide range of
labour and civil rights. It applies to all the gold and coal mines managed
by Anglo.
At a signing ceremony this week, Mr Marcel Golding, assistant general
secretary of the NUM, which has more than 300,000 members, said the
agreements were of 'major historical significance'. The code, and the
accompanying agreement on dismissal and disputes procedures, arose out of
the bitter 1987 miners' strike and took four years to negotiate.
Relations at the mines between unions and management, and between workers
themselves, have often been fraught and violent. In November last year, 86
people died at Anglo's President Steyn gold mine near Welkom in clashes
during a national stayaway to protest against VAT.
The code seeks to balance the rights and responsibilities of managers, union
leaders and union members in a way which acknowledges fundamental liberties
and avoids violence and intimidation.
Important labour rights are recognised, such as the right to freedom of
association, peaceful picketing and full disclosure of relevant information
and there is a commitment to job and skills development to correct past
imbalances. Sensitive matters such as wearing political insignia and singing
and dancing at mass meetings are also dealt with.
These rights are balanced by limitations which essentially protect the right
of management to manage, and individual workers to dissent from union
activities without fear of violence.
Mr Bobby Godsell, the industrial relations director at Anglo, said that at a
time when national political negotiations were deadlocked it was instructive
that two parties deeply divided, with a history of violent conflict and
vastly different ideological beliefs, had negotiated such an important
agreement.
